Thierry Henry faces an emotional reunion with Arsenal and
he's getting in the mood by teaching Gunners stars to play basketball.

The Gunners legend's New York Red Bulls side face Arsenal in
a friendly on Saturday as part of the club's USA tour.

And Henry is already larking about with his old team's
stars, getting the likes of Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey on the basketball
court.

However, it was youngster Gedion Zelalem who stole the show,
trumping the senior stars by netting a perfect basket first time.

Manager Asene Wenger has said that the club's World Cup winning contingent will miss the start of the season. Lukas Podolski, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil's seasons technically only finished two weeks ago ad Wenger says they will be given extra time to recover.

The Gunners will play New York Red Bulls on Saturday before heading home to host The Emirates Cup. This year Arsenal will be joined by Monaco, Benfica and Valencia.

Wenger's side will then face Manchester city in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 10.
