A Scotland Yard report on the Plebgate affair shows ‘industrial levels of dishonesty by police working in Downing Street’, a senior Tory MP said last night.

David Davis hit out after the Met published a series of documents summarising its inquiry into the aftermath of the incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked.

The Met also identified a female officer who texted a colleague two days after the incident to declare that she could ‘topple’ the Tory government. And it released new CCTV footage, of the heated disagreement between diplomatic protection officer Toby Rowland and then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell at the gates of Downing Street in September 2012.

Previously-unseen CCTV images of the Plebgate row reveal that a passer-by witnessed the confrontation between police and Mr Mitchell.

The man, who is clearly seen following the exchange, has never been traced.

Today’s CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell cycling down the middle of the street and then talking to three officers at the gate while a fourth stands nearby outside.

In the original police account, several members of the public are said to have witnessed the exchange and were ‘visibly shocked’. 

A Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 challenged this with images obtained from CCTV shot from within Downing Street.

But today's separate CCTV footage shows there were at least three members of the public outside the gates at the time of the row.

At least one appeared to be listening to the exchange.

PC Rowland alleges Mr Mitchell called police officers ‘****ing plebs’ during their exchange. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’ but has apologised for swearing.

Tory MPs and supporters of Mr Mitchell said that, despite the report being a ‘police report into the police’, it still showed dishonesty by officers working in Downing Street.

They said serious questions must now be asked about whether the Diplomatic Protection Group in charge of guarding No. 10 was fit for purpose.

Mr Davis, a former shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘What we have got here is evidence of industrial-scale dishonesty. There was a pack of policemen telling a pack of lies. This involved serious collusion between police officers who set out to harm the democratically elected Government.

‘Despite their attempts to justify their action on security grounds, it transpires that the only written guidance was that ministers should have ‘unfettered access at any time of day or night and at any entry point’.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up Andrew Mitchell.

‘It’s shocking that specialist officers recruited to protect Downing Street saw fit to engage in such an outrageous plan to topple a senior minister. It’s a serious blow to public confidence in the police.’

Further details were also revealed of how a policewoman on duty in Downing Street on the night of the Plebgate incident texted a colleague two days later to say she could bring down the Government.

WPC Gillian Weatherley saw, but did not hear, what happened between Mr Mitchell and PC Rowland.

In the text, which had grammatical errors and was sent on September 21, 2012, to a colleague referred to as Officer 18, Weatherley wrote: ‘This will make you feel better, I’m the officer that stopped the chief whip leaving Downing St in Wednesday. He didn’t swear at me but Toby that let him out the side gate. I could topple the Tory government x.’

At a misconduct hearing, Weatherley said she had known the recipient of her text for more than 20 years and the message was just ‘banter’.But a month later, on October 21, a text message was sent from her phone number to a neighbour called Nick. It read: ‘Not today but I’m at the front gates tomorrow so I still have time to bring the government down…’ Weatherley lost her job after she failed to provide an honest account of her role in the handling of an email by PC Rowland that described the incident.

She denied having passed on PC Rowland’s email when she had in fact sent a picture of the email to a colleague. This was passed to a newspaper.

Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell was targeted by a police conspiracy after swearing when blocked from cycling through the main Downing Street gates

CCTV footage shot from within Downing Street and published by Channel 4's Dispatches programme was held up by Mr Mitchell's allies as proof that there was no sign of any passers-by said to have overheard him rowing with police

In April, two of the most senior officials in the scandal-hit Police Federation quit – days after the Daily Mail revealed that the union, unhappy about proposed cutbacks, had hired a PR firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government in the run up to Plebgate. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan, who led the inquiry into Plebgate – codenamed Operation Alice – said: ‘We understand the public interest in this case, which is why we have taken the unusual step of publishing this material.

‘Ultimately four police officers have been dismissed from the Met, one of whom was sent to prison. Every serving police officer has cause to feel let down by those colleagues who fall below the standards we all strive to uphold.’

The report also unearthed details of Mr Mitchell’s previous altercations with police in Downing Street.

A former head of security and business continuity at No 10, who is not named, said there were two incidents dating back to 2011 when the Tory MP swore about not being allowed through a rear entrance.

Mr Mitchell is involved in two potentially expensive libel actions over Plebgate. He is suing the Sun newspaper over its original report about his row with PC Rowland, who, in turn, is suing Mr Mitchell over comments he made at a press conference last year. The case is due before the courts in November.

PC Rowland is being backed by the wealthy Police Federation. Critics say the police should not be able to bring civil suits against members of the public, because it could stop them challenging an officer’s version of events.
