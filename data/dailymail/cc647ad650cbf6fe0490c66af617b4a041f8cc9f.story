Disgraced teacher Jeremy Forrest is ‘not a paedophile’ and ‘genuinely loves’ the schoolgirl he abducted, his sister claimed yesterday.

Carrie Hanspaul said it was wrong to call the 30-year-old maths teacher a paedophile as the pupil was ‘15 not 11’ when he started a sexual relationship with her.

‘It is the wrong word. She was 15, not 11. Underage yes, but a paedophile is somebody who would  generally target pre-pubescent girls.

Protective: Jeremy Forrest's sister Carrie says that her brother is not a paedophile and she knows that he wants to be with his schoolgirl lover when out of jail

Court: Carrie said that she met the girl for the first time during her brother's trial and comforted her as she sobbed

Married: Jeremy and Emily Forrest together before he allegedly ran off to France with a pupil. She has filed for divorce

‘I think it’s wrong that that’s what he’s being branded,’ she told ITV’s Daybreak programme.

The 33-year-old claimed that her 
married brother ‘genuinely loves’ the schoolgirl, with whom he spent 
eight days on the run before being arrested.

Mrs Hanspaul also revealed that his 
devastated wife Emily, 32, had filed for a divorce and has not  spoken 
to their family since he fled to France with the schoolgirl last 
September.

Forrest was jailed for 
five-and-a-half years on Friday after a jury heard how he started 
grooming his ‘vulnerable and infatuated’ victim when she was just 14 to 
satisfy his ‘carnal lust’.

Caught on camera: Forrest and the girl aboard a ferry from Dover to Calais last September, and she clearly still has feelings for him despite his abduction conviction

Mugshot: Jeremy Forrest was told by the judge that he had broken the cardinal rule of teaching when he had an affair with a young pupil

He first kissed her in his classroom at Bishop Bell Church of  England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

When she turned 15, they swapped 
topless photos by text and he seduced her at secret meetings in his 
marital home, his car and budget hotels.

The girl told a friend that the pair 
would have sex up to eight times a night. But after police were tipped 
off last September, they fled to France on a ferry.

They were caught eight days later in 
Bordeaux. Before the trial the schoolgirl wrote an emotional letter to 
his parents vowing to wait for him and said that she was focusing on 
building a future for them both.

The pair mouthed ‘I love you’ to each
other as he was found guilty and he later told his parents that he 
planned to marry the teenager, who recently turned 16, after his 
release.

Mrs Hanspaul told ITV’s Daybreak programme that if the pair did marry his family would attend the wedding.

‘Obviously, if they have managed to 
survive all of this, and he stays in there all that time, she will be 
21, he will be 35, that then would become, if you like, a normal  
relationship. Obviously, we would support them, if that’s what they 
chose to do,’ she said.

But she said that did not mean the 
family approved of his actions and they had all ‘told him off’. ‘But 
being angry at him isn’t going to help him,’ Mrs Hanspaul added

The older sister also revealed that 
the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had already written to 
Forrest in prison and planned to visit him.

She also told how he had become 
withdrawn during his  ‘difficult’ marriage.‘We would just do everything 
we could do as a family to help him, because we believe that he has been
suffering for a good many years, possibly with depression.’

She added: ‘We, in a way, saw 
something coming, we just didn’t know what it was going to be, and 
didn’t think that this is what it was going to be.’

Dismissing reports that Forrest had 
been attacked in prison as false, Mrs Hanspaul said that her brother was
doing ‘brilliantly’.
