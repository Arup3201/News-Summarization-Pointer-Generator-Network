Wearing a turquoise polo neck with her hair neatly blow-dried, Irene Lewis Ward, 87, looks every inch the prosperous retiree.

But the Wiltshire grandmother's innocuous appearance hides a secret - and one that could strike at the heart of the Danish monarchy.

For Mrs Ward claims to have proved that she is the great granddaughter of King Frederik VII, a monarch who supposedly died childless and left his throne to a cousin from whom current ruler, Margrethe II, is descended.

Delighted: Mrs Ward says she is delighted to have finally discovered the truth about her history

Ruler: Danish queen Margrethe II is descended from Frederik's cousin, Christian of Glucksburg

According to Mrs Ward, whose story has been turned into a book that has sent shockwaves through Danish society, she is descended from Frederik and his third wife, former ballerina Louise Rasmussen.

King Frederik VII was believed to have died childless, with the throne passing to Prince Christian of Glucksburg, but Mrs Ward says he actually had a secret daughter who was smuggled away to Wales for her own safety.

'It was amazing to find it all out. It was a long process but we got there,' said a delighted Mrs Ward. 'It's great to put all the pieces together.

'There is plenty of the king's [Frederik's] blood flowing in the UK, even if they didn't know about it at the time.'

Mrs Ward's tale begins with her grandmother Elizabeth, who according to the 87-year-old, is the daughter of the Danish monarch and his third wife.

Although King Frederik had had two previous royal marriages, both were unhappy and ended in divorce.

His third match, with 'commoner' Louise, caused an outcry and the match was morganatic - between people of unequal rank - which meant his title and privileges could not be automatically claimed by his wife or children.

Until Mrs Ward came forward, it was thought the couple had not had children, leaving the throne empty when Frederik died.

Instead, claims Mrs Ward, they had a daughter named Elizabeth who was born in February 1851 but kept her existence a secret in order to avoid a war.

Had the child been a boy, the royal pair would have announced his birth to the nation, confirming him as Frederik's heir and successor.

The birth of a girl, her parents feared, could spark a German-assisted revolt, pitching the Scandinavian country and its larger neighbour into a bloody war.

Desperate to keep the birth secret, the royal couple approached the British Government for help and came up with a plan to spirit the newborn out of the country.

Elizabeth was taken by Sir Henry Williams-Wynn, the British Ambassador to Denmark, from Copenhagen to his country estate in north Wales.

The child grew up anonymously in Britain, later marrying and having three children. Tragically, she died young, perishing soon after her husband and eldest son.

One of the two remaining children was Mrs Ward's father, John, who was just six at the time of his mother's death, and who in later life, began the search for his maternal grandparents.

'My father spent his life looking for his mother's people,' explained Mrs Ward. 'He spent many years trying to find out, and ultimately failed.

Quest: Mrs Ward took up the search for her great grandparents after her father's death

'He 
discovered his mother was connected to the Williams-Wynn family but 
every time he asked a question about her, no one would tell him 
anything.

'I had seen how much it had bothered my father and when he died, I vowed I would one day take up his search.'

Mrs Ward and her late husband began their own search in 1969, and in 1981 the trail had led her to Copenhagen.

There, the final piece in the puzzle fell into place when she tracked down the great-great granddaughter of the wet nurse who had taken the baby to Wales.

The woman had promised to keep it a secret until her death, with Mrs Ward agreeing not to tell anyone until after she had died.

'Her family had kept this secret for all those years,' said Mrs Ward. 'Her great-great grandmother was the wet-nurse who had to take the newborn baby girl of the King and the Countess. 

'She took her with the British ambassador all the way to north Wales and handed the baby over to a family in a village. It all fitted, and I realised the mystery had been solved.

'I promised not to tell the story until after this lady had passed on and now I can.

'All that time we were looking in north Wales for a family scandal - the daughter of one of the Williams-Wynn family getting pregnant or something like that. 

'We had no idea we would discover that I was the great-granddaughter of the supposedly childless King of Denmark. The story means an awful lot to me.'
