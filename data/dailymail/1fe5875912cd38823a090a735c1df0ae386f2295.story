David Cameron believes Ed Miliband will be ousted as Labour leader before the next election, according to Tory insiders.

The Prime Minister has told colleagues in recent days that he thinks his opponent’s attempts to get a grip on the union funding row will backfire and the Labour party is getting panicky as the polls narrow.

The two men clashed in the Commons today over party funding, with Labour accused of being in the control of the unions while the Tories faced accusations of giving tax cuts to millionaire donors.

Pressure: Ed Miliband (left) will not survive as Labour leader until the 2015 election, David Cameron believes

Conservative strategists want 
to keep Mr Miliband in his job, believing he is unlikely to win 
widespread support at the general election.

Mr Cameron also believes Labour is deeply damaged by Andy Burnham continuing as shadow health secretary after the Mid Staffs scandal happened on his watch as Health Secretary.

Mr Miliband’s position has become threatened revelations emerged about his union paymasters trying to influence candidate selection.

Mr Cameron has stepped up his attacks on the Labour leader in recent weeks, branding him weak and in hoc to the unions.

Now he has made clear to allies that he believes Mr Miliband's time could be up as Labour leader.

A
Tory source said: ‘The PM thinks Miliband will go before the election. 
This union stuff has dragged on now and he really looks in trouble.

Foreign Secretary William Hague became embroiled in a row after calling a Labour MP a 'stupid woman' in the Commons.

As Cathy Jamieson asked David Cameron about donations to the Tory party, Mr Hague was seen on the frontbench muttering 'stupid woman, stupid woman'.

Miss Jamieson had raised questions about whether donations from Aidan Heavey had influenced Mr Hague's decision to intervene in his company's tax dispute.

Mr Cameron replied: 'The donations to the Conservative Party do not buy votes to our party conference, they don't buy votes for our leader, they don't mean you can select candidates. That is the unhealthy relationship in British politics.'

But Mr Hague was seen making the remark while sitting next to the PM.

He later told the Commons: 'I mutter many things in this House.

'Others shout them rather louder than I do but I mutter many things under my breath and I never intend any offence to any other honourable members.'

Downing Street said it was a 'humorous remark'.

‘There
was a time when it was doubtful if any of the party leaders would 
survive until the election. But the Tories are more settled now and the 
Lib Dems seem stuck with Clegg. It’s Miliband who looks vulnerable now.

'Andy Burnham is also a problem for them, after everything that happened at Mid Staffs.'

Bookmakers now offer odds of 9/2 that Mr Miliband will be replaced as leader before the election, with Yvette Cooper and Chuka Umunna among the favourites to replace him.

In the Commons today the two leaders engaged in angry clashes over party funding in the wake of the Falkirk ballot-rigging row.

The
Prime Minister accused the Labour leader of having been 'bought' by 
union paymasters, and said he could not gloss over Unite's efforts to 
fix parliamentary selections.

But
Mr Miliband hit back, insisting that his Tory counterpart was 'owned by
a few millionaires at the top of society', challenging him to agree a 
£5,000 cap on donations from individuals, businesses and trade unions.

Mr Miliband used a major speech 
yesterday to seek to put a lid on the scandal, promising ‘big changes’ 
to the Labour party’s relationship with the unions.

But
after the plans were welcomed by both Unite’s general secretary Len 
McCluskey and former Prime Minister Tony Blair, there are fears in the 
Labour party that they will do little to reassure voters that Mr 
Miliband is showing strong leadership.

At Prime Minister's Questions today 
Mr Miliband claimed that the Conservative Party had received £24 million
in donations from hedge funds.

He urged the Tory leader to reopen stalled talks on party funding reform and sign up to a donation cap.

But
Mr Cameron said all donations to his party were publicly declared, and 
warned that a cap could cost the taxpayer millions of pounds.

The
Prime Minister said: 'Here are the figures - £8 million from Unite, £4 
million from GMB, £4 million from Unison. They have bought the policies,
they have bought the candidates and they have bought the leader.

'I
have long supported caps on donations. I think we should have caps on 
donations and they should apply to trade unions, to businesses and to 
individuals.

'But let 
me be frank with you, there's a problem with a 5,000 cap. It is this - 
it would imply a massive amount of taxpayer support for political 
parties.

'Frankly, I don't see why the result of a trade union scandal should be every taxpayer in the country paying for Labour.'

Weakness: Senior Tories have also identified shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (left) as a target for his links to the Mid Staffs scandal

Row: Mr Cameron, pictured walking to the Commons today, tried to brush aside the Labour call for a £5,000 cap on donations

At Prime Minister’s Questions last 
week Mr Cameron accused Mr Miliband of being ‘too weak to sack his 
Health Secretary (Mr Burnham)... too weak to stand up to the Unite union, too weak to
run Labour, and certainly too weak to run the country’.

The
PM could barely contain his glee that the Unite union was demanding ‘a 
firmly class-based and left-wing general election campaign’.

Since
then the row over the role of Unite in allegedly trying to fix a 
candidate selection in Falkirk and elsewhere has escalated.

While Labour has descended into internal warfare, the Conservatives have enjoyed one of their best periods in government.

In
the last week Mr Cameron has seen more than 300 Tory MPs backed a Bill 
promising an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership, hate cleric Abu 
Qatada finally put on a plane to Jordan, increasing optimism that the 
economy is growing faster than expected and even welcomed Andy Murray to
Number 10 after his Wimbledon triumph.

Glee: Mr Cameron could barely contain his delight at sharing the limelight with Wimbledon winner Andy Murray outside Number 10 this week

Delight: The Tory mood has been buoyed by the success in deporting hate cleric Abu Qatada to Jordan after a decade of legal battles

In recent days Labour’s lead over the Conservatives has fallen to just six per cent in some polls.

Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband will lock horns across the despatch box again today, with Labour’s union woes likely to dominate.

However, some Tories will urge the Prime Minister to ease off on attacking Mr Miliband, believing the Labour leader remains key to a Conservative election victory.

The Opposition leader will attempt to turn the focus back on the Tories after a week of deeply damaging allegations about ballot-fixing in the Falkirk constituency.

Yesterday Mr Miliband set out radical proposals to end the automatic affiliation of union members Labour - a move that party figures acknowledge could cost it millions of pounds a year.

But Unite general secretary Len McCluskey confounded expectations of a furious showdown with unions by insisting he was ‘very comfortable’ with the idea.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed the plan as ‘a real act of leadership’ and admitted that he should probably have taken the same step when he was in charge between 1994 and 2007.
