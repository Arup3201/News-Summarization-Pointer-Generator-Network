Bans: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is looking at the idea of preventing young drivers from carrying passengers

Young drivers could be banned from carrying passengers for nine months after they pass their test, under proposals being considered by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.

Mr McLoughlin said he was looking at ideas put forward by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which it says could cut the number of accidents involving young motorists.

He said: ‘I read regular reports where three or four young  people have been killed in a car and it’s a new driver and you  wonder what happened.

‘When I talk to young people who have recently passed their test, they say sometimes that there is peer pressure put on them to go fast, to show off.

‘They are not drivers with a huge amount of experience by the very fact of them being new drivers. I think we have got to look at that.’

Mr McLoughlin said he was considering whether measures should be put in place for novice drivers to carry no passengers other than immediate family members.

He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘There is a suggestion as to whether you should look at a restriction whether anyone could carry passengers for six or nine months when they have first passed their test.

‘There are suggestions about them only perhaps being allowed to take a family member.’

Peer pressure: Inexperienced drivers say they are sometimes pressured into driving fast or distracted with other people in the car

The ABI says one in eight drivers is under 25, but they account for a third of people who die on UK roads.

It also says an 18-year-old driver is three times more likely to be involved in a crash than a 48 year-old driver.

In 2011, drivers aged between 17 and 19 were involved in 12,000 crashes, of which more than half resulted in serious or fatal injuries.

The association has also called for a curfew banning young drivers from the roads at night.
