After six months sheltering in the warmth and security of his mother's pouch, this cute baby joey is taking his first peek into the big bad world.

The fluffy little Matschie's tree kangaroo and his much larger mother both have thick woolly coats, so look more like bears than traditional kangaroos.

This male Joey, named Rocket, was born in captivity at the Saint Louis Zoo in Missouri to his mother Kasbeth and father Iri, and will remain in Kasbeth's pouch for another two months before actually taking his first tiny steps into the outside world.

Room for a little one: The baby Matchie's tree kangaroo has been in the pouch for six months

Matschie's tree kangaroo joeys tend to stay and develop in pouches for the first eight months of their lives, and also return to them frequently for milk in the following two months, before being let loose for good.

Little Rocket was incredibly small when he was born - just the size of a butter bean - but has now grown to the size of a small cat.

Visitors have been flocking to the zoo to catch a rare glimpse of him peeping out of his pouch, but only few are lucky enough to spot the little joey, as he pokes his head out and admires his new surroundings.

Bear necessities: The tree kangaroos seem to resemble bears rather than their kangaroo cousins

The Matschie's tree kangaroo is highly endangered, and can only be found in the wild in the mountainous forests of Papua New Guinea - some of the last undisturbed rainforest habitat in the world.

They spend most of their time in trees, and can live at heights of up to 11,000 feet.

They are vegetarian, and eat mostly leaves, as well as bark, flowers, moss and ferns.

A joey will stay with its mother until it is about 18 months old, before leaving to set up a home  of its own.

They are believed to be polygamous and fairly solitary creatures, with the only real bond seen between mother and baby.
