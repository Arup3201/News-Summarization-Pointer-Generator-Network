Veteran television correspondent Mike Amor has reported on many major events during his time as a journalist from September 11 to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, so he thought standing next to a skate ramp would be safe.

But during his piece-to-camera at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, the U.S. bureau chief for Channel Seven was nailed in the back of the head by a skateboard.

In the 13-second video, a loud thwack is heard when the board makes contact after a skater loses his footing.

Amor is heard saying 'You'd be right to be sceptical, thousands of traditional skateboarders...' before the sudden interruption.

After the collision, Amor doubles over clutching his head but is heard saying 'I'm good, I'm good' while the skater who hit him apologises. 

Despite the wince-inducing footage, the journalist walked away unscathed and like a real professional he continued doing his job.

'Shook me up for a couple minutes but went on to finish doing the piece-to-camera,' he told Yahoo!7.

Surprisingly, the veteran journalist walked away unscathed but it did give him a bit of a shock

He has been a journalist for almost 30 years, and has reported on Hurricane Katrina and September 11

Surprisingly, the hit did not cause any bleeding. 

Mike Amor's career has spanned almost 30 years.

The Channel Seven journalist was born in Bendigo in Victoria but now lives in Malibu with his U.S. wife, Tracy, and his son, Addison, according to his website.
