He had high hopes of emulating the work of guerilla artist Banksy. 

But aspiring street artist Justin Lewis, who wanted to keep his identity a secret, was unmasked when police caught him red-handed.

Instead of being hailed as an artist much like his hero, Lewis was charged with criminal damage.

Prosecutor Mark Salter said: 'He was spotted holding up a stencil and spray painting a picture of a woman wearing a gas mask.

'There are a number of residential and business areas which have been vandalised with this type of graffiti.'

Lewis was linked back to dozens of graffiti pieces through his tag 'Enemie'.

He would paint his creations in the middle of the night around his home city of Newport, South Wales.

Since Banksy made his name with his 
trademark stencil-style 'guerrilla' art in public spaces - on walls in 
London, Brighton, Bristol and even on the West Bank barrier separating 
Israelis and Palestinians - his works have sold for hundreds of 
thousands of pounds.

He has dozens of celebrity collectors including Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera.

Paul Philpott, defending Lewis, said: 'He was taught to channel negative energy into art.

'It seems to be very beneficial, and he is hoping to go to college to do a course in art later this year.

'It's not just about graffiti, he is genuinely interested in art.'

Lewis admitted criminal damage and
was given 180 hours of unpaid work, a 12-month community order and told
to pay £105 in costs by magistrates in Cwmbran, South Wales.

He was also warned to stop doing street art despite the fame of Banksy.

Chairman of the bench Keith Minton told him: 'You are very close to going to prison'.
