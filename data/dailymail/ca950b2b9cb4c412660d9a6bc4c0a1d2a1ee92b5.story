A newly released video shows the moment Cleveland police officers tackled and restrained Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister after their colleague shot dead the 12-year-old boy. 

The grainy surveillance video made public by the City of Cleveland shows the officers struggling with the teen before shoving her into the back seat of a patrol car parked next to the where Rice lay on the snowy ground bleeding.

Northeast Ohio Media Group is reporting that it obtained the nearly 30-minute-long footage from the city after officials initially refused to release it. Other media outlets were given the video Thursday.

A newly released video shows the moment Cleveland police officers tackled and restrained Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister just moments after the 12-year-old was shot 

The footage shows the officers struggling with the teen just steps away from the spot where her young brother lay bleeding on the snow

Putting up a fight: The sister tries to rise several times, but the officers repeatedly push her down

Patrol officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir in the abdomen within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near the boy November 22. He died the next day.

Tamir's family gave the city permission to release another version of the video days after the shooting. 

That shorter video shows Tamir in a park near a recreation center carrying what turned out to be an airsoft gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets. The video ends with Loehmann shooting Tamir.

Loehmann, a rookie cop with a checkered employment history, and his training officer and the driver of the patrol car, Frank Garmback, had responded to a report about a man with a gun on November 22.

Strong words: The Rice family's attorney described the treatment of the 14-year-old at the hands of the officers 'the cruelest thing I've ever seen on video'

A police union official has said the officers thought the gun was real and that they didn't know Tamir, who was 5 feet 7 and weighed 195lbs, was so young.

The new video begins with the shooting of Tamir. About 90 seconds later, Tamir's sister, whose name has not been released, runs toward her fallen brother and Garmback immediately pushes her to the ground. 

Garmback and another officer are then shown handcuffing the struggling teen and finally placing her in the back seat of Loehmann and Garmback's patrol car.

Walter Madison, an attorney for the family, called the treatment of the 14-year-old sister, who he would not name, 'the cruelest thing I've ever seen on video.'

Prosecutors will present evidence to a grand jury to determine whether charges should be brought against Tim Loehmann (far left) and his partner

He also criticized the officers for not providing Tamir with medical attention. An FBI agent on a bank robbery detail nearby arrived about four minutes after the shooting and began first aid.

The city last week turned over the investigation of the shooting to the Cuyahoga County sheriff's department.  

The completed investigation into Tamir's shooting is expected to be turned over to county prosecutors, who will present evidence to a grand jury to determine whether charges should be brought against Loehmann and Garmback. 

At a press conference held a day before the video's release, Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, demanded accountability for her son's killing, which she characterized as a murder.

'The family is entitled to an answer,' attorney Walter Madison said.
