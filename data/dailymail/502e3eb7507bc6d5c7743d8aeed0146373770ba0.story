A fire that killed three generations of one family including a nine-week-old baby was last night said to have been caused by a faulty phone charger.

Boys Adyan Parwaiz Kayani, nine, Amaan Parwaiz Kayani, seven, and their nine-week-old sister Minahil died with grandmother Shabina Begum, 53, in the blaze at the family home in Sheffield a fortnight ago.

Mrs Begum escaped the fire but died after going back in to try to save her trapped family. Her daughter, Anum Parwaiz, 20, who was the children’s aunt, also died in the blaze.

Tragedy: The burnt-out Sheffield house where three children, including a baby, and two women died in April, which started in the living room at night

Although detectives are not yet 
certain of the cause, they said yesterday it was probably a faulty 
charger used for phones and tablets.

It is believed the device was in the living room of the terraced house.

The
 tragedy highlights growing concerns about cheap, dangerous chargers 
bought over the internet that overheat and cause fires or injuries. Most
 problems occur at night – the most convenient time to recharge tablets 
and smartphones. But constant charging for hours can heat badly-made 
devices to dangerous levels.

Tearful: Aunt of the children, Nazia Parwaiz Kayani, cried last week as she paid tribute to three generations of her family who perished

Moving: Hundreds gathered last week for the funerals of the children and adults killed in the devastating Sheffield fire a fortnight ago

Bereft: Amaan and Adhyan with their father Nazim Parwaiz, who was at work during the blaze and his wife escaped

Bereft: Cousin Ishfaq Hussain Kayani said today 'in a matter of minutes the whole family has been destroyed'

The
 children’s mother, Razia Nazim, was asleep but able to escape the blaze
 just after midnight on April 28. She was comforted by friends and 
neighbours as she cried: ‘I want to see my children.’

Her husband, Nazim Parwaiz, screamed as he was held back from trying to reach the dying youngsters.

He
 had been out working as a taxi driver but rushed home to see the 
emergency services desperately trying to restart the children’s hearts 
using cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Neighbour
 Quasim Saddique, 20, said: ‘I heard screaming and glass shattering, and
 when I got down to the house, the fire brigade was already there.

‘I
 saw them carrying the kids in their arms out from the house and giving 
them CPR.’ A funeral for the family on Thursday was attended by more 
than 2,000.

Ishfaq Hussain Kayani, the cousin of one of the women who died, yesterday paid an emotional tribute to the family.

He
 said: ‘It’s a huge tragedy, five members of one family dying like this.
 A 54-year-old mother, her daughter, a 20-year-old student and three 
adoring grandchildren have lost their lives.

‘Just
 in a matter of minutes the whole family has been destroyed.  You can 
imagine what the children’s parents are going through. I don’t have the 
words to describe how the family is feeling, other than shell-shocked, 
devastated.

‘The 
grandmother came out of the house and made several attempts to go and 
rescue the three children along with her daughter. She gave her life 
trying to rescue her grandchildren.

‘She
 was a wonderful lady – very generous, kind and an excellent wife and 
caring mother. She was just the perfect person.’ A spokesman for South 
Yorkshire Police said the full inquest into the deaths of the two women 
 and three children could reveal more details.

He
 added: ‘Following a joint investigation, South Yorkshire Police and 
South Yorkshire  Fire and Rescue have found  that the most probable 
cause  of the fatal house fire in  Nether Edge, Sheffield, was an 
electrical fault involving a  faulty charging device.’

Several deaths have been linked to faulty chargers, leading experts to warn against buying cheap counterfeits.

An investigation in October by the Trading Standards Institute found dangerous chargers and adaptors that fail European safety standards are being sold on the internet for just £5.

Of 21 chargers and adaptors it tested – all bought from UK sellers – 15 were unsafe, and seven were deemed so unsafe they posed a risk of electrocution.

While it is not known whether a counterfeit product caused the fire that killed the five members of the Parwaiz-Kayani family, such products have been blamed for other incidents.

Last year, Chinese air stewardess Ma Ailun, 23, was electrocuted when she answered her iPhone while it was charging.

Connor O’Keefe, seven, died in 2007 while playing with his Gameboy. Connor, from South East London was using an unsafe charger his family had bought on holiday in Thailand.
