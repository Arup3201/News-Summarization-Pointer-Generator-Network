A defiant restaurant owner in Alaska refused to let a little flooding stand between his customers and an order of Thai ribs and fried rice.

Anuson 'Knott' Poolsawat, owner of Knott's Take Out in North Pole, forded the swollen waters of Clear Creek to reach two customers stranded along the Richardson Highway.

Mike Laiti and Brandon Borgens were completing a multi-day drive Saturday night up the Alaska Highway when they called in their order to the restaurant, which was near closing.

Rain or shine: Anuson 'Knott' Poolsawat, owner of Knott's Take Out in North Pole, Alaska, forded the swollen waters of Clear Creek to reach two customers waiting for a takeout order

Precious cargo: Poolsawat held the takeout boxes over his head so as not to get an order of Thai barbecue ribs, Thai fried rice and a hard-boiled sweet 'dinosaur egg' soggy

Unstoppable: Poolsawat drove more than 25 miles to reach two customers who had ordered food from him but were unable to pick it up because of a sinkhole

As they approached Clear Creek, they learned a sinkhole had developed from heavy rain near the creek. The state Department of Transportation closed the bridge.

Laiti called Poolsawat to cancel their order at the restaurant more than 25 miles away in North Pole.

'I called him and said, "Hey man, I can't make it," and he said, "Not a problem, I'll come cross the waters,"' Laiti told Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. 'He called me and said, "Should I bring a boat?"'

Poolsawat arrived with takeout boxes containing Thai barbecue ribs for $13 and Thai fried rice. Another box held a 'dinosaur egg' — a hardboiled egg that's fried and covered in a sweet sesame sauce.

Poolsawat hiked up his shorts and waded through the creek, holding the takeout boxes over his head. The frigid water was hip-deep.

Poolsawat had already done them a favor by staying open late, Laiti said. The delivery was beyond expectations.

'He'd help anybody out. He's just a really good positive attitude, just a good guy,' said Laiti. 'He's definitely a goofball character and the food he makes is great.'

Above and beyond: Poolsawat hiked up his shorts and waded through the creek filled with frigid water that reached his hips

Satisfied customer: Mike Laiti (pictured on Poolsawat's back left), one of the two men who ordered takeout from Knott's Saturday, said that the delivery was beyond his expectations

The two friends later posed for a hilarious Facebook selfie, with 'Knott' dressed in a Superman T-shirt giving Laiti a piggyback ride outside his takeout joint.

Poolsawat's waterlogged heroics, which have been covered by both local and national media, have been very good for business.

On the restaurant’s Facebook page, the moustachioed owner has repeatedly boasted about having to go into town to resupply after selling out of most of the items on the menu.

He has been using the social media forum to keep his customers abreast with the availability of his Thai favorites, which have been selling like hotcakes since the now-notorious delivery.

Ironic: on Tuesday, it was Poolsawat and his friends who were in need of rescue after they became stranded with their pickup truck

In an ironic twist of fate, on Tuesday it was Poolsawat himself who was in need of rescue when he became stranded outside North Pole with two friends and a dog.

Poolsawat posted a status update asking anyone with a four-wheel drive to come and pull their pickup truck from the riverbank.

'I know that sounds like a bad joke,' the local hero sheepishly admitted before making a plea for help.
