A British man has been found dead lying on the ice beneath a bridge in the Russian capital of Moscow yesterday.

Eye-witnesses said the 'youngish' man leaned over the rail and fell from Novoarbatskiy Bridge at around 6.40pm on Wednesday. He suffered multiple fractures and died instantly.

He is believed to have hit a slab of 
concrete encased in ice close to the semi-frozen waters of the Moscow 
River. The temperature in Moscow last night was around -4C.

Police sources said the man had 
earlier reported that he had lost his passport and other documents, and 
was taken for assistance to the British Embassy.

The bridge is several hundred yards from the British Embassy and also close to the Russian parliament building.

An eyewitness named as Yaroslav said: 'The man was standing on the bridge for a long time. Then he leaned over the handrail and fell down, on the ice. He died instantly.

'He received multiple fractures.'

Footage on Russia's Life News 
website, which suggested the death was suicide, showed the corpse of a 
man on a pavement near the bridge after rescue services had removed his body from the ice close to the river.

The man fell onto concrete that was covered in ice. It is believed he died instantly

A police source said: 'This man came to the police because he had lost his documents. He was taken to the British Embassy.'

'At 6.40 pm on Wednesday a witness called the police emergency number and said he saw a man walking on the edge of the bridge, then climbing the railings and jumping down.'

A spokesman at the embassy said today: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Moscow.

'We are following up with local police and stand ready to provide consular assistance to relatives.'

She declined to give further details.

Sources in Moscow say that the man was believed to be a visitor to Russia and that having lost his passport and possibly money, he had nowhere to stay.

It is understood consular staff arranged for him to call his bank in Britain before assisting him in finding a hostel that did not demand a passport.

Russian police believed the embassy was preparing to assist him with a replacement travel document and help him solve the problems caused by the loss of all his documents.

It is not known why the man later returned from the hostel to the bridge close to the embassy.
