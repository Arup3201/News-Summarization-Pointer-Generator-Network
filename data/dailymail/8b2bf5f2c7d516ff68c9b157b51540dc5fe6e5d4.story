Everton are discussing a potential £150,000 deal for Shelbourne’s young right-back Ryan Robinson.

The 18-year-old is tipped to follow in the footsteps of Seamus Coleman who Everton signed for a bargain £60,000 from Sligo Rovers in 2009 and is now rated in the £20million bracket.

Robinson has already spent time on trial at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground and Shelbourne boss Johnny McDonnell said: ‘Ryan certainly has a big future in the game.

‘Everton would have seen a rawness to him but he has a lot going for him.

‘We’d have no problem allowing him to move on to a better level in England. Everton are chipping away with us on Ryan at the moment and we hope to get the deal over the line soon.

‘The initial fee won’t make us millionaires but we’ll make sure it’s heavy on the end of it. It might be better for us to go for the add-ons and everything else.’
