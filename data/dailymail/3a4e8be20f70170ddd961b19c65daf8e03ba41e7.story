In limbo: Scott Wilson, 23, was killed in a Florida car crash four years ago, but his ashes have yet to be put to rest because his divorced parents are at odds over what to do with them

The ashes of the young man killed four years ago in a fiery car wreck by a drunk-driving millionaire cannot be split among his divorced parents, a Florida judge has ruled.

Scott Wilson, 23, died in 2010, but his ashes have yet to be put to rest because his divorced parents were butting heads in a bitter court battle over the remains.

A judge for the 4th District Court of Appeals, in Palm Beach, reached all the way back to the 1700's to cite a case on human remains that ruled they are not 'property,' the Sun Sentinel reported.

That judge then quoted the words of judge who in 2005 made a similar ruling in the state,

'It is a sorrowful matter to have relatives disputing in court over the remains of the deceased,' Judge Martha Warner wrote, according to the paper. 'In this case in particular, there is no solution that will bring peace to all parties.'

Wilson, an engineering graduate, was killed February 12, 2010, when John Goodman, the millionaire founder of The Palm Beach International Polo Club, rammed his Bentley into the victim's Hyundai and sent it flying into a canal.

Wilson's parents were divorced at the time he died.

A Catholic Mass was held one week later, after which Wilson's body was cremated.

William Wilson's attorney argued last month that his son's ashes 
should be treated as property owned by whoever has possession of them, 
and can therefore be divided, according to Palm Beach Post.

But
 the lawyer representing Lili Wilson insisted that human remains cannot
 be considered property. Therefore, the ashes cannot be split up between
 the two feuding former spouses.

William 
Wilson wishes to lay his share of son's remains in a family cemetery 
plot in Georgia. His devout mother, however, wants the ashes to remain 
intact in Palm Beach County.

Judge Melanie May expressed concerns in court at the time that treating a person's cremated remains as property could be offensive to people's spiritual views.

Not at peace: The final fate of Scott Wilson's ashes will soon be decided in a trial court

Attorney Kristina Pett, who represents Lili Wilson, agreed.

‘A person is not a thing. A person cannot be owned,’ she argued. ‘Just because the parents decided to cremate Scott does not make him property. Scott’s a person.’

William Wilson's counsel, Joy Bartmon, countered by saying that in this day and age, people dispose of loved ones’ ashes in various ways, from scattering them at sea to wearing them in lockets.

‘The law is clear: we can’t do anything we want with a body, but we can do anything we want with ashes,’ she stated.

The dispute over Scott Wilson's ashes is only one issue in which his parents have been at odds.

The Wilsons, who split in 2007, have fought bitterly over the husband's baseball card collection and ownership of their home videos.

A final determination is yet to be made where Scott Wilson's ashes will finally end up. That will be determined in a trial court.

'This opinion does not guide the trial court in the determination to be made,' William Wilson's lawyer Joy Bartmon said in an email. 'Instead, what will occur when the decision as to the ashes goes back to the trial court, is what I wanted to avoid.

'The final resting place for this young man may be left to the discretion of an administrator who never knew him.'

Florida tycoon John Goodman was convicted of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in May 2012 and sentenced to 16 years in prison and a fine of $10,000, but he was granted a retrial last year after a juror at his first trial was adjudged to have lied to get on the panel.

Goodman, the multimillionaire 
founder of one of world's largest polo clubs, claimed in court that
 his $200,000 Bentley malfunctioned and lurched forward, slamming into 
Wilson's vehicle.

He has also denied being drunk at the
 time of the crash, although other testimony has contradicted him and 
his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit three hours 
after the crash, according to prosecutors.

Goodman fled the scene of the accident, authorities said. During his first trial, Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.'

Goodman reached a settlement with the Wilson family and paid out $46million in compensation to them. It was split evenly between the divorced spouses prior to accounting for legal fees, court records showed.

Goodman also made headlines when he 
adopted his girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, in an attempt to preserve 
part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement. 
Last March, a Miami appeals court reversed the ruling that allowed the 
adoption.

During the original trial the 
judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice 
standpoint. Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of 
fullness of life.'

Goodman’s second trial was originally scheduled to begin in March, but it has been delayed indefinitely.

Prosecutors successfully claimed that
 Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into 
Mr Wilson's car four years ago, causing it to roll into a canal, where the 23-year-old man drowned after being unable to free himself from his seat belt. 

The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes.

Goodman left the scene and waited an 
hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery 
as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene.

After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

At trial Goodman said he was sure of 
one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the
 crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to 
alleviate his pain.

After leaving a bar, he said his car 
suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my 
brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used 
to,' he said.

Unable to control the vehicle, it 
slammed into the side of Scott Wilson's - even though Goodman said he was not 
aware he had hit another driver so left the scene.

If Goodman had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help,' he claimed.
