A teenage boy and his friend suffered horrific burns in Zimbabwe after they were allegedly forced to walk over hot coals as punishment when they were overheard talking during a sermon in church, it was reported today.

The 14-year-old youngster and his companion, a 21-year-old man, were rushed to hospital following the bizarre incident last weekend.

Six members of their local gospel church were arrested following the alleged attack, which happened on Sunday in the central town of Chitungwiza.

The New Zimbabwe website reported that the victims, who have not been named, were literally hauled over the coals after they were caught talking through the pastor's sermon.

Police spokesman Tarirai Dube said: 'The two victims were accused of talking while the church leader was addressing at the church service on Sunday at around 9am.'

The officer told the publication a gang of congregants grabbed the pair and marched them towards an open fire. 

He said: 'It is alleged that as punishment, the two victims were forced to stand near a fire place while the six suspects were on guard, holding their hands in a circle so that they would not escape.

'The two eventually fell onto the fire, resulting in the 21-year-old being seriously burned on both legs and feet, while the 14-year-old suffered burns on his left leg and under both feet.'

New Zimbabwe reported that the two victims were admitted to the Chitungwiza Central Hospital, where they remained in a stable condition. 

Police officials confirmed six men had been charged over the incident.

The suspects are all believed to be members of Zimbabwe's True Gospel Apostolic Faith Church.Inspector Dube named them as church leader Justice Nguni, 35, and congregants Courage Macheka, 24, Martin Mazvazvido, 43, Jesca Mushakavanhu, 40, Clifford Murota, 37, and Richard Rushaya, 16.

New Zimbabwe reported that all were due in court this week to be charged with assault.Chitungwiza is a densely-populated township area which lies around 20 miles south of Zimbabwe's capital Harare.

Christianity is one of the major religions of Zimbabwe, where around three quarters of the population are believed to be Christian and the majority attend regular services.

Robert Mugabe, the country's leader since Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain in 1980, is a devout Catholic.
