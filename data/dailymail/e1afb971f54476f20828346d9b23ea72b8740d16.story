A pensioner has told how he was shot with a pellet gun before being viciously attacked by a group of yobs on a bus while the driver refused to help because of company safety policy.

Grandfather Fred Gilroy, 68, had already been shot with the gun on the upper deck of the bus before he was punched and kicked to the floor just feet away from the driver’s protected cab.

Mr Gilroy, who had confronted the gang of teenagers about their unruly behaviour, said after they fled the bus by triggering the emergency door release, the driver apologised claiming he wasn’t allowed to leave his cab for health and safety reasons.

A local councillor has joined the pensioner in demanding that bus company First does more to protect passengers.

A First spokesman said: 'We would urge anyone with information to go to the police to help catch these vile individuals.

'Our
drivers are encouraged to do all that they can to assist our passengers
in such difficult circumstances. As part of this process they have to 
consider their own safety and that of all other passengers on board the 
vehicle.

'If they do not 
feel that leaving their cab is a safe course of action then we would 
expect them to raise the alarm so that the emergency services can be 
called.'

Mr Gilroy had been travelling on the upper deck of the 636 service in Bradford, West Yorkshire when a group of about five teenagers started misbehaving on the back seat.

He said a First staff member in uniform came upstairs to confront them but after being verbally abused backed off and a short time later left the bus.

Mr Gilroy was then shot in the ear with a pellet gun. He went downstairs to speak to the driver, who pulled over, but the yobs then came down the stairs and surrounded him.

'They were all round me,' said Mr Gilroy. 'They were jumping on the seats and drop-kicking. They got me down in two minutes.'

Concern: Local councillor, Sinead Engel, said passengers have 'every right to expect to be safe travelling on buses and bus drivers have a duty of care to protect them'

Mr Gilroy said they kept kicking him while he was on the floor before running from the bus.

He said: 'The bus driver said, "I’m sorry you got a kicking, but we are not allowed to come out".'

The driver called the emergency services and Mr Gilroy was taken to hospital with severe bruising. He later rang First to complain about its security procedures, but he said the woman he spoke to even questioned him about what he had been doing on the top deck.

He said: 'The safety of people travelling during the day on the bus is at stake. If this occurs again, if a gang of lads get on, the way she was talking, they can run riot. That can’t be right.

'They should have some quick way of getting security to that bus.'

Local councillor, Sinead Engel, said: 'Passengers have every right to expect to be safe travelling on buses and bus drivers have a duty of care to protect them.

'I wouldn’t want to see drivers putting themselves at risk unnecessarily, but I certainly wouldn’t have been able to just stand by and watch.'

Sergeant Alastair Milner, of the Bradford North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: 'This was a cowardly attack by the individuals involved, who had no cause to use such level of violence, particularly against a lone 68-year-old man.'

Anyone with information about the attack, which occurred on November 7 at about 11am, should contact police on 101.
