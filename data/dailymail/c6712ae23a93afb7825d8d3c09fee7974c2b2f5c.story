A tearful uncle has spoken about the moment he discovered the bodies of his two young nephews who had been stabbed to death by their mother.

Leighton Dennis walked in on the grisly scene at the Manchester home of Romario Mullings-Sewell, two, and three-month-old Delayno Mullings-Sewell.

Mr Dennis said he ‘knew something had happened’ as soon as he stepped into the house belonging to his sister Jael Mullings.

Tragic: Leighton Dennis walked in on the grisly scene at the Manchester home of Romario Mullings-Sewell, left,  two, and his brother three-month-old Delayno

Mullings was sectioned indefinitely after killing Romario and Delayno on November 12, 2008.

She denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Mr Dennis and his mother Andrea found the youngsters’ bodies at their home in Kilmington Drive, Cheetham Hill.

They had became increasingly worried after Mullings, then 21, arrived at her auntie’s house without her two sons.

She said that she was 'the devil’ and her sons were ‘at peace’, the inquest at Manchester Crown Court heard.

Horrifying: Mr Dennis and his mother took a taxi to Kilmington Drive and found the door unlocked - they shouted out Romario’s name but they did not get an answer, so made their way upstairs and made found the two bodies

Mr Dennis and his mother took a taxi to Kilmington Drive and found the door unlocked.

Mr Dennis said the house was ‘a bit messy’ and added: 'It didn’t seem normal at all. There’s a sort of organised chaos with kids around and it’s never completely tidy. But it seemed as if something had happened.”

Mr Dennis and his mum shouted out Romario’s name but they did not get an answer, so made their way upstairs.

Leading Mr Dennis through his evidence, Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'Very sadly when you came into Jael’s room you saw the two children.'

Troubled: Jael Mullings said that she was 'the devil' and her sons were 'at peace', the inquest at Manchester Crown Court heard

'Yes,' replied Mr Dennis.

Mr Meadows said: 'Essentially it was obvious to you that they had been injured and in simple terms there was understandable panic and there was a need to phone an ambulance. I think the children were lying on the bed?'

'Yes they were,' said Mr Dennis, who was then overcome with grief and bent over in tears.

The inquest earlier heard how Mr Dennis was close to his sister and visited her once or twice a week.

He told how Mullings developed an interest in religion and the search for truth.

Mr Dennis said: 'As she was growing up she expressed strong spiritual beliefs.

'She wasn’t an avid churchgoer. She wanted to seek the truth. That was the sort of mission her and my mum were on at that time. (Jael) would read the bible and scriptures.'

Mullings, who is now in a secure hospital unit, told her family after killing the boys that she was ‘a child of Israel’ and ‘the devil’ and had the power to give life and take it away.

The inquest continues.
