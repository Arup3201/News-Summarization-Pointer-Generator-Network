A 13,000-year-old bone fragment with an engraving of a mammoth or mastodon has been found in Florida.

Scientists believe the etching is the oldest, and only known, example of Ice Age art to depict a proboscidean - or an animal with a trunk - in the Americas.

The bone was found in Vero Beach by amateur fossil hunter James Kennedy, who later discovered the engraving while cleaning it.

Researchers claim it is evidence that people living in the Americas during the
 last Ice Age created artistic images of the animals they hunted.

The
 engraving is at least 13,000 years old - this is the date of the last
 appearance of these animals in eastern North America, and more recent pre-Columbian people would not have seen a mammoth or mastodon to draw.

Researcher Dennis Stanford, of the Smithsonian Institute, said: 'This is an incredibly exciting discovery.

'There are hundreds of depictions of proboscideans on cave walls and carved into bones in Europe, but none from America - until now.'

The engraving is three-inches long from the top of the head to the tip of the tail, and 1.75inches tall from the top of the head to the bottom of the right foreleg.

The fossil bone is a fragment from a long bone of a large mammal - most likely either a mammoth or mastodon, or less likely a giant sloth.

A precise identification was not possible because of the bone's fragmented condition and lack of diagnostic features.

Lead researcher Barbara Purdy, of the University of Florida, said: 'The results of this investigation are an excellent example of the value of interdisciplinary research and cooperation among scientists.

'There was considerable scepticism expressed about the authenticity of the incising on the bone until it was examined exhaustively by archaeologists, paleontologists, forensic anthropologists, materials science engineers and artists.'

One of the main goals for the scientists was to investigate the timing of the engraving - was it ancient or was it recently engraved to mimic an example of prehistoric art?

It was originally found near a location, known as the Old Vero site, where human bones were discovered side-by-side with the bones of extinct Ice Age animals in an excavation from 1913 to 1916.

The team examined the elemental composition of the engraved bone and others from the Old Vero site.

They also used optical and electron microscopy, which showed no discontinuity in colouration between the carved grooves and the surrounding material.

This indicated that both surfaces aged simultaneously and that the edges of the carving were worn and showed no signs of being carved recently or that the grooves were made with metal tools.

The team's research also further validates the findings of geologist Elias Howard Sellards at the Old Vero Site in the early twentieth century.

His claims that people were in North America and hunted animals at Vero Beach during the last Ice Age have been disputed over the past 95 years.

A cast of the carved fossil bone is now part of an exhibit of Florida Mammoth and Mastodons at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville.

The team's research is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.
