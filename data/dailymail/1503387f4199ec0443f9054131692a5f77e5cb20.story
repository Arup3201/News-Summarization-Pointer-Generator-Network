Jurors watched in horror as CCTV footage of a car ploughing into three men in a 'modern-day chariot charge' was played to a murder trial yesterday.

Brothers Shazad Ali, 30, Abdul Musavir, 31, and a third man, Haroon Jahan, 20, were seen being catapulted up to ten feet through the air after being struck by a Mazda saloon.

It happened at the height of the rioting which swept the country last August.

The driving was part of a 'deliberate and co-ordinated' attack involving three vehicles, where the first car drew the victims into the road and thus into the path of the two following, the court heard.

Yesterday eight men went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court, each charged with three counts of murder.

Some relatives fled the courtroom while others sobbed as the 15-second clip showed one of the men somersault through the air. 

The
court heard how tensions between the different communities in 
multicultural Birmingham had become particularly inflamed during the 
riots. 

And jurors were also told that occupants of the Mazda were allegedly heard shouting 'Pakis, Pakis, we're coming for you,' followed by: ‘Pakis we are going to come back and shoot you,' shortly before the incident.

Prosecutor Timothy 
Spencer QC had earlier warned the nine women and three men of the jury 
to ‘prepare to be shocked’ by the ‘shocking’ footage.

As it the moment of impact was 
replayed on flatscreens around the courtroom, some in the public gallery
gasped in horror, while others became embroiled in an angry exchange 
which led to the case being temporarily halted. 

Eight men today went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court, each charged with three counts of murder.

The jury watched as CCTV showed a 
black Audi A3 Quattro slow down as it passed a group of men standing on 
the pavement - drawing them off the pavement into the road.

Yards behind, the Mazda 6 and a Ford Fiesta were seen pulling up alongside each other.

As the Audi slowed, the driver of the
Mazda gestured with his arm outside the window to the Fiesta now 
alongside in Dudley Rd, Winson Green.

The two cars drove forward, with the 
Mazda veering straight in to the group of men. Its bonnet sprung up on 
impact as the victims were flung over the top of the car, which was 
found burnt out around 90 minutes later.

After the clip had finished, Mr 
Spencer told the jury the Mazda driver’s gesture was ‘a signal, 
particularly to the Fiesta, to go (forward).'

He added: ‘The driving you have just seen was not chance. It was not accidental.

‘It was deliberate and co-ordinated. It was the modern day equivalent of a chariot charge. And it was deadly.’

He said the three victims were ‘killed in shocking circumstances.'

Mr Justice Flaux cleared the court after a heated argument broke out in the public gallery

The court heard all eight defendants were allegedly in the three cars at the time of the incident.

Ryan Goodwin, 21, Shaun Flynn, 26, 
Juan Ruiz-Gaviria, 31, Joshua Donald, 27, Everton Graham, 30, Adam King,
24, Ian Beckford, 30, and Aaron Parkins, 18, all from the Birmingham 
area, were surrounded by seven dock officers as the trial began.

Beckford was allegedly driving Graham
in the Mazda, Donald was said to be carrying Parkins in the Fiesta, 
while King was allegedly driving the remaining three defendants in the 
Audi.

Mr Spencer told the jury the killings
unfolded amid high tension in an area of Birmingham where ‘a high level
of the population are of Asian origin, and almost everyone who has a 
faith is of the Muslim faith.’

He said the incident took place 
during the faith’s Ramadan period of fasting, in a three-day period 
where there was a ‘breakdown of order across the country’, including 
Birmingham.

One of the important factors in that 
breakdown was widespread looting of businesses, with a string of 
businesses targeted in the Winson Green area.

Mr Spencer said that hours before the
car ploughed in to the men, tensions were increasing in the area, 
tensions which had been ‘ratcheted up’ by ‘gangs of youths driving 
around in vehicles who were looking for places to raid and, on the other
hand, crowds or gangs from the community – essentially Asian males out 
on the street, many armed with sticks, bats and bricks.’

He added: ‘All of the men in the dock
must have been aware of that backdrop. That backdrop was the reality in
this area of Birmingham.’

Mr Spencer said one car seen with 
three balaclava-clad men in the back at the Jet petrol station close to 
where the three victims were killed was likely carrying out ‘a form of 
reconnaissance…looking for somewhere  to target later.’

The court was told that the night 
before the murders, Tariq Jahan – the father of victim Haroon Jahan – 
witnessed a convoy of three cars carrying mainly black passengers who 
were wearing scarves or balaclavas.

Mr Jahan told police the cars parked 
in a street behind the Jet garage. Up to 15 men got out and walked 
towards the petrol station, moments before it came under attack from a 
mob of looters who armed themselves with plastic milk crates stacked on 
the forecourt.

Footage of the attack was yesterday 
played to the jury and showed masked men smashing through the petrol 
station windows with the crates before one leapt inside to steal money 
from the till. They were beaten back by a garage worker armed with a 
metal pole.

Mr Spencer said that the following 
day, the local community ‘got together and decided they had to protect 
their businesses’ when nightfall arrived, in order to ‘prevent further 
looting’.

Up to 100 Asian men had gathered on the streets armed with sticks, bats and batons from around 9.30pm on the evening of August 9.

The court was shown footage of a rock being thrown at a Saab belonging to Beckford's brother, John, has he turned into Dudley Road. The court was told there was then a flurry of calls between the two brothers and their associates. Within minutes, the Mazda, Audi and Fiesta were on the scene.

The court heard Beckford later claimed: 'We all went down there to back him (brother John) up'. Mr Spencer said 'perfectly legitimate questions' could be asked about whether the conduct of some of the Asians was lawful.

But he added: 'We do suggest that there was a genuine desire amongst many if not all of them to protect their businesses and livelihoods.

‘They lived in the area, they depended on the businesses in the area to survive.

‘The prosecution are here to put before you what we say was murderous conduct.

‘Whatever one's view about the actions of both sides of the divide, the prosecution say that the driving, the heart of the case, the driving which culminated in three deaths was out of any sensible proportion to anything that had gone on before and that conduct, that driving was murder and nothing less.’

The trial continues.
