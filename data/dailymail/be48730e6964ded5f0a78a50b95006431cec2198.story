Left wing luvvies, artists and celebrities poured hundreds of thousands of pounds into the Labour party's coffers last night - as the party ramped up its fundraising drive ahead of the next election.

Two games of five-a-side football with a team of Labour 'all stars' including Ed Balls, Jim Murphy, Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, went for £24,000, while £1,000 was raised after Hollywood star Patrick Stewart offered to record a phone voicemail.

One bidder is understood to have pledged more than £105,000 for artist Antony Gormley's 'Small Turn III' - a 106cm pillar of blocks made of cast iron. And a ceramic lion with the words 'Vote Labour' made by Grayson Perry, the cross-dressing artist, went for £42,000, according to one Labour MP at the event.

Despite telling voters there is a cost of living crisis in the UK, the top draw at the Labour summer party was a cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley which had a reserve price of £100,000 and sold for £105,000

Labour was accused of ‘staggering hypocrisy’  for refusing to publish the names of the guests who attended the lavish fundraising dinner with Ed Miliband.

Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart, Bianca Jagger and Stephen Fry attended the fundraising ‘gala’ dinner.

Labour has refused to comment on who was on the guest list for last night's event at the trendy Roundhouse music venue in Camden, north London.

The fundraising auction, presided over by Nick Finch - the director at Christie’s - also sold off three bits of art by Mark Wallinger, Nicola Green and Anish Kapoor - for £60,000 in total.

A 'premium table' for nine guests at last night's star-studden 'Election Gala Dinner' cost £15,000 – more than a year's wage on the minimum wage.

But the amount of cash marked down as a 'donation' on the ticket was £7,000 – just below the level at which gifts must be declared to the Electoral Commission.

Members of the shadow cabinet were guests on the most expensive tables, as well as some former cabinet ministers such as Lord Kinnock.

More than 600 guests turned up for the event, which came a week after the Tories held their lavish 'summer ball' at the exclusive Hurlingham Club in west London.

The Labour supporters were entertained by acrobats and dancers and dined on asparagus, monkfish and rhubarb custard on tables surrounded by flowers, ivy and trees.

According to the Financial Times, comedian Stephen Fry introduced Mr Miliband claiming that the Tories’ first duty was to the 'rich and reprehensible' while Labour stood for ordinary workers and the vulnerable.

Mr Miliband told the crowd that the next general election was 'ours to win'.

He added: 'This is a battle of ideas, not about bandwagons or photo opportunities.' He added: 'Some people have been saying some things in newspapers – they’ve been saying it because they fear we’ll win.'

Artist Grayson Perry arrived in a sequin dress and green platform shoes while comedian Eddie Izzard had red lipstick and painted nails.

Former 
cabinet minister Lord Mandelson was joined by TV presenter and Mail 
columnist Janet Street-Porter while ex-leader Neil Kinnock, now Baron 
Kinnock, was with wife Glenys.

The secrecy surrounding last night's event was slammed by the Tories - who said Mr Miliband's hypocrisy 'knows no limit'.

Tory MP 
Henry Smith said: ‘They say one thing
 then do another – and it’s staggering that they choose the evening 
before their union bosses cripple the country and disrupt millions of 
ordinary people’s lives for their secretive fundraising dinner.’

Eyebrows
 were raised last week as it emerged a guest at the Tory dinner bid 
£160,000 to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson in a 
fundraising auction.

It
 later emerged the bidder was Lubov Chernukhin, wife of Vladimir 
Chernukhin, Russia’s former deputy finance minister.

Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and his wife Glenys, long-term supporters of Ed Miliband, were among a host of senior party figures at the fundraiser
