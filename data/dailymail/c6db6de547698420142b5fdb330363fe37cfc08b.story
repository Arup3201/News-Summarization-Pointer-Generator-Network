A players’ meeting called after the fourth successive Ashes defeat emerged on Wednesday as the pivotal event leading to Kevin Pietersen becoming an England outcast.

The summit in Melbourne — without team management present — was the idea of Matt Prior, the England vice-captain who had been dropped after the Ashes were lost in Perth.

Prior, who regards the England team ethic as all-important, still wanted an opportunity for the players to discuss without fear of recrimination how they could improve dressing-room morale and the team environment.

The consensus within the squad was 
that England team director Andy Flower had been too much of a 
‘headmaster figure’ during the tour and needed to relax his iron grip to
 get the best out of the team.

It
 was after the meeting following the Boxing Day Test defeat that 
Pietersen, rather than captain Alastair Cook, took it on himself to tell
 Flower where the players felt he was going wrong.

The
 ECB have refused to clarify the details of the fallout because of legal
 complications, including confidentially clauses in the Pietersen 
settlement.

But this version
 of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the 
Pietersen camp, who maintain that their man was the only player prepared
 to tell Flower some home truths.

It
 also brings some context to the explosive tweets on Wednesday by 
broadcaster Piers Morgan, KP’s flag-waver-in-chief, who claimed Prior 
told his team-mates at the summit that Flower was ‘behaving like a 
headmaster’ and that they were playing in a ‘schoolboy environment’.

According to Morgan, Prior added: ‘F*** Flower, this is our team.’

Morgan
 further tweeted, after challenging Prior to take legal action if the 
accusations were incorrect: ‘You stabbed Pietersen in the back, yet you 
agreed with him re Flower’s dictator style. Makes you a flaming 
hypocrite.

‘For the record, @MattPrior13 (Prior) led the England team meeting after Melbourne Test. And slaughtered Flower.’

Prior
 responded: ‘I don’t do this PR, spinning media rubbish, but I refuse to
 be attacked by a bloke that knows very little about what goes on in the
 England set-up apart from rumour, gossip and hearsay from certain 
individuals.

‘I’m not the 
kind of person to divulge what is said in team meetings, but all I will 
say is that Flower, Cook and the rest of my team-mates know exactly what
 I said and the way it was meant.’

Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '"Re-integration complete. Well played".'

Ironically,
 Prior had acted as peacemaker when Pietersen was left out of the 
England team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract.

But
 the wicketkeeper continued his attack on Morgan by saying: ‘There is no
 story here, just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the 
team’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to
 help the England cricket team.

‘I can hold my head up high in that knowledge!’
