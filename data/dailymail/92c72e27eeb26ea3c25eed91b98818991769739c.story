Two convicted bank robbers have escaped a federal prison using knotted bedsheets high above downtown Chicago on early Tuesday, one week after one of them made a courtroom vow of retribution.

The escape that left the 'rope' dangling from a Metropolitan Correctional Center's window occurred sometime between 5 am and 8.45am when Chicago Police Sgt. Mark Lazarro says the inmates were discovered missing.

Hours later, the escape mechanism was spotted approximately 20 stories above the ground with Joseph 'Jose' Banks, 37, and Kenneth Conley, 38, gone.

Both men had been wearing prison-issue orange jumpsuits, but now might be wearing white t-shirts, gray sweat pants and white gym shoes, Lazarro said.

The FBI said the men were last seen together in the Tinley Park area, about 25 miles southwest of Chicago, and that they should be considered armed and dangerous.

SWAT teams stormed a Tinley Park home early Tuesday afternoon, but the escapees were not there, FBI Special Agent Frank Bochte said. He said there was evidence the two had been there earlier, and authorities were using dogs and helicopters to search various places in the Chicago area where the two had connections.

Banks is described as a black man, 5-feet-8, weighing 160 pounds. Conley is described as white, 6 feet tall, weighing 185 pounds.

Bandits: Banks was convicted last week of two bank robberies and two attempted robberies where he made off with a nearly $600,000, $500,000 of which is still unaccounted for

Something in common: Conley was convicted of robbing nearly $4,000 from a bank last year before meeting Banks

The men apparently descended from a 
thin window barely half a foot wide on the flat south side of the prison
into the alley below. The wall faces a parking garage and is above air 
conditioning or heating units.

Crowds
of people gathered outside the building where the ropes still blew in 
the breeze, shaking their heads in disbelief that someone could have 
escaped from a lockup in the heart of downtown Chicago, just a block or 
two from key federal court and office buildings.

The owners of several small shops across the street from the wall said they didn't see any police activity until around 8:30 a.m., when a dozen or more police cars and SWAT teams rushed into the area. Some police officers sprinted for a nearby subway entrance.

'It was clearly already too late. They were long gone,' said Randy Cohen, owner of the Royal Jewelry and Loans store 10 or 20 yards from where the inmates scaled down the rope.

Homeland Security and U.S. Marshal's 
Service agents questioned him later in the morning and asked if security
cameras on his building could have captured the escape or the men 
fleeing, Cohen said. He said he didn't think the cameras would have been
pointed in the right direction.

Liquor store owner Baljit Singh has a clear view of the side of the prison where the men escaped. She said there was no indication anything was amiss when she arrived at work at 7am

The facility, which houses around 700 inmates, is one of the only skyscraper prisons in the world, said Jennifer Lucente of Chicago Architecture Foundation.

Architect Harry Weese designed the building in the mid-1970s. Its triangular shape is supposed to reduce the number of blind spots for guards, Lucente said. Each cell has a window as part of the building's humane design, she said.

Change of clothing: There was evidence the two had visited a Tinley Park home earlier providing them with items such as clothing that would relieve them of their orange prison suits

Surprise visit: Word of the inmates' visit to this Tinley Park home belonging to a family member of one of the men sent television news crews outside in hopes of catching its owner

Security concerns have arisen before about the lockup.

Last year, federal authorities opposed a request from attorneys for Mexican drug-cartel lieutenant Vincente Zambada — held there on trafficking charges — to let him out on the rooftop recreational area, where in the summer inmates can be seen playing basketball. Officials feared snipers could target Zambada or that he might try a daring escape from atop the 27-story building. He was later moved to a lockup in Michigan.

In 2010, the brother of Hollywood director Christopher Nolan was sentenced to 14 months for plotting to escape from the facility by hiding a rope made out of bed sheets in his cell. Matthew Nolan, who was being held pending an extradition request, pleaded guilty to possessing contraband in jail and obstruction of justice.

Banks, known as the Second-Hand Bandit because he wore used clothes during his heists, was convicted last week of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two more. Authorities say he stole almost $600,000 and that most of that is still missing.

After U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer convicted him, he said he would 'be seeking retribution as well as damages,' the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune reported.

When the judge asked how long he needed to submit a filing, Banks replied, 'No motion will be filed, but you'll hear from me.'

Conley pleaded guilty last October to robbing a Homewood Bank of nearly $4,000.
