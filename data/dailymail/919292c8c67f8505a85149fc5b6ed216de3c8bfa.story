A new era for Brazilian football is starting and could these two be the players to restore Brazil to their former glory?

Neymar is well established as the golden boy of Brazilian football, but Liverpool star Philippe Coutinho – recalled to the squad after missing out on the World Cup – will be hoping to be his heir apparent.

The midfielder came on for the last 20 minutes of Brazil’s 1-0 friendly win over Colombia during the early hours of Saturday morning and will be hoping to start against Ecuador on Wednesday.

Golden boys: Brazil captain Neymar and Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho can restore Brazil to their former glory

Coutinho started Liverpool's first two Premier League games of the season but was left on the substitutes' bench for his side's 3-0 win against Tottenham.

The former Inter Milan midfielder scored five league goals during last season's league campaign but was unable to cement a place in Luiz Felipe Scolari's plans. 

However it appears Coutinho has managed to worm his way into new coach Dunga's thinking.
