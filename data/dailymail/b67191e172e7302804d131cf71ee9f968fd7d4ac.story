Ever since he was a boy, British engineering student Jack Streat has had two passions in life: guns and Lego.

So when he decided to combine the two, he used his collection of toy bricks to build a Lego arsenal, block by block.

The Durham University student's creations were so realistic that he has become an internet sensation, and has a YouTube following of over 30,000 subscribers.

Combined passion: Jack Streat, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, has built an impressive arsenal of guns using nothing but LEGO

The Durham University student's creations were so realistic that he has become an internet sensation, and has a YouTube following of over 30,000 subscribers

He teaches fans how to fashion anything from a Desert Eagle with blowback action to an AK-47 assault rifle - using nothing but little, coloured blocks.

'It started when I was about 12,' he told FoxNews.com. 'Guns were my thing at that age and I always built with Legos, so it was obvious to combine two things I thought were pretty cool at the time.'

His collection has grown into an impressive armoury of over 30 different types of gun, all of which shoot tiny Lego bullets thanks to a rubber-band firing mechanism.

He has also published a 360-page DIY tutorial book called 'Lego Heavy Weapons' which has sold more than 4,000 copies.

Cars to guns: While he may have become less interested in making cars as he grew older (pictured left aged eight) and more into guns, the material he used to build them never changed

Showing promise: Jack was already making complex structured out of Lego when he was just ten

He says each gun costs around £60 to build but he won't sell them. Instead he likes to keep them at home in case he needs the bricks to build more.

But his unusual hobby-turned-profession is not about glorifying guns, he says, but about finding new ways of being creative.

'They’re less powerful, less realistic and less durable than an Airsoft gun,' he said. 'And they’re not as dangerous. So whatever views you have on Airsoft guns apply vaguely here. For me, it was about finding something interesting to build and guns filled that criteria.'

His book also includes a warning.

M249 PARA: His unusual hobby-turned-profession is not about glorifying guns, he says, but about finding new ways of being creative

The Uzi: Because they are so realistic, he says it is important to make a crucial modification to the firearms to avoid unwanted police attention

Fire power: A Thompson submachine gun, or Tommy gun

Colt Python semi-automatic: He says each gun costs around £60 to build but he won't sell them. Instead he likes to keep them at home in case he needs the bricks to build more

Realistic: Jack's wokring UMP 45, with folding stock and detachable Reflex sight

The Minigun: A rubber band minigun with two speeds, 8 barrels and fires 104 rounds

The SA80: A version of the L85A2 (nicknamed the SA80). Bullpup, fires bolt action from 11-brick magazines

'When building or firing them, always wear eye protection,' it reads. 'For maximum safety when carrying these models, the hammer and bolt should both be forward and the chamber empty. The replicas may fire when dropped or hit.'

Because they are so realistic, he says it is important to make a crucial modification to the firearms to avoid unwanted police attention.

'If you take your Lego gun out in public, add a bright orange tip to the muzzle as a way of saying that it’s not the real thing.'
