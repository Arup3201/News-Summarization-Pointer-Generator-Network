Bestselling author Iain Banks has been given only months to live, he revealed yesterday.

The writer, 59, who is best known for The Wasp Factory, announced he has gallbladder cancer, is ‘unlikely’ to survive longer than a year and will bring forward publication of his latest book.

He said he had asked his partner, author and horror film curator Adele Hartley, to ‘do me the honour of becoming my widow’.

The couple have married in private and are now on a short honeymoon.

Banks has withdrawn from all engagements and plans to spend time with friends and family. On his website, he said he was ‘officially very poorly’.

He added: ‘The bottom line now, I’m afraid, is that as a late-stage gallbladder cancer patient . . . it’s extremely unlikely I’ll live beyond a year.

'So it looks like my latest novel, The Quarry, will be my last.’

Banks is an award winning writer and was named by The Times newspaper as one of the 50 greatest living authors in 2008

Publisher Little Brown is hastening the release of The Quarry to give him ‘a better chance of being around when it hits the shelves’, he said.

It was due out in October but may be ready by June.

Banks, who was born in Fife and studied at Stirling University, had success with his first novel, The Wasp Factory, in 1984.

He has written more than 20 books, including science fiction under the name Iain M Banks.

He noticed a pain in his lower back in late January but put it down to spending hours ‘crouched over a keyboard’.

‘When it hadn’t gone away by mid-February, I went to my GP, who spotted that I had jaundice,’ he said.

‘Blood tests, an ultrasound scan and then a CT scan revealed the full extent of the grisly truth by the start of March.’

The cancer, which started in his gallbladder, has spread and is effectively inoperable, he said.

He is considering whether to have chemotherapy, but cannot start treatment until his jaundice improves.

A website has been set up for fans to leave messages of support and fellow authors have expressed their sadness.

Scottish crime writer Ian Rankin referred on Twitter to Banks’s dark humour, saying: ‘Typical of Iain to propose marriage to his partner Adele with the words “Will you do me the honour of becoming my widow?”’

Thriller writer Mark Edwards tweeted: ‘Just saw the sad news.

'Wasp Factory, Walking On Glass, Crow Road – some of the best novels I’ve ever read.’

Banks wrote that he has withdrawn from all future public engagements and has married his partner, Adele

The gallbladder concentrates and stores bile from the liver as part of the digestive system. Gallbladder cancer is rare in the UK but is more common among women.

It does not cause symptoms in the early stages, grows quickly and is often not diagnosed until the cancer has spread.

Most early-stage cancers are found by chance. At more advanced stages, symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain and nausea. If the cancer is diagnosed early enough, surgery is the most effective treatment.

As it advances it can spread to lymph nodes, the liver and other organs. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to stem its spread but only one patient in ten with advanced gallbladder cancer survives for five years.

Vanda Taylor, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Gallbladder cancer is seldom diagnosed early and therefore can be very difficult to treat successfully.’
