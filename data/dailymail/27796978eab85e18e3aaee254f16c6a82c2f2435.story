A New York middle school teacher claims he was forced to resign after he appeared shirtless at a raucous pool party on reality TV show 'Princesses: Long Island.'

Stefan Serie, 30, was a health teacher at Merrick Avenue Middle School in Long Island when he appeared, flashing his rippling abs, in the first episode of the new Bravo show, which follows the lives of six so-called Jewish-American princesses.

In his brief cameo, the 30-year-old laughs in the background as the beauties drink alcohol from red plastic cups and bounce around in teeny bikinis by a pool.

But just a week after the June 2 episode aired, Serie, an eight-year teaching veteran who was rated 'highly effective' during the last school year, said he was hauled into the school district office by angry officials.

He said administrators told him his tenure offer would be rescinded and pressured him to resign, even though there was nothing illegal going on in the scene.

He told the New York Daily News. 'I didn't do anything that I would tell my students not to do.'

Serie reluctantly agreed to quit, giving up his $75,000-a-year job.

'It was a coerced resignation,' he said.

According to the Daily News, the 
teacher, who has degrees in health and physical education from Hofstra 
University, is now fighting to be reinstated and said he would sue the 
TV show if the school refused.

Chaos: Serie, pictured in the green shirt, said he realized as the pool party descended into chaos that he didn't want to be associated with the show

'I want my job and tenure back. I think I deserve it,' Serie said.

Parents are equally outraged at Serie's dismissal, believing the school over-reacted. Some are planning to attend a protest tonight ahead of a school district meeting, demanding the toned teacher be allowed to return to classes.

Rosemary Garofolo, whose two 12-year-old boys took Serie's seventh-grade health class, said there wasn't a kid in school who didn't love the teacher, adding that her sons learned a great deal about nutrition from the clearly health-conscious educator.

'Honestly, I think as long as he 
wasnâ€™t doing anything illegal on the show, I don't see why it should 
matter what he does in his time,' she told the Daily News.

The part time triathlete said he was 
approached by a producer friend from Bravo about the program and then 
cast member Ashlee White met him for lunch and invited him to the pool 
party.

But the party descended into chaos, ultimately ending with slanging match between two of the 'princesses.'

Serie said he realized during the profanity-heavy fight that he didn't want to be associated with the show and he can be seen showing his disdain, fully clothed, in the background.

'I was an ancillary character in the background,' he told the Daily News. 'The behavior of the cast members was not something I wanted to be a part of moving forward.'

Serie said the harrowing experience has impacted the stellar reputation he's worked hard to build but he hopes he'll be back at school doing what he loves soon.

'I'm devastated. This is the most difficult experience of my life,' he said.

The Bellmore Merrick central School District superintendent John DeTommaso said in a statement to MailOnline: 'Stefan Serie submitted his letter of resignation to the district on June 26, 2013 and the Board of Education accepted his resignation at the July 9, 2013 meeting. As this is a matter of personnel, the district legally cannot disclose any further details.'
