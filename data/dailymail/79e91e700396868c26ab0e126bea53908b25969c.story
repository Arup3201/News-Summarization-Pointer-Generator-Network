A woman arrested for shoplifting allegedly managed to steal a police cruiser and drive it at 100mph despite her hands being handcuffed behind her back.

Police say that she manipulated the car’s controls with her back to the wheel, leading officers on a high-speed chase through the outskirts of Pittsburgh before ditching the car.

The drama began when Roxanne Rimer, 27, was stopped by a security guard at Kohl’s in Center Township, Beaver County, because he suspected her of shoplifting.

Police say that Roxanne Rimer (pictured under a blanket, 27, stole a police car and led officers on a 100mph chase

The police cruiser was left with visible damage following the chase

She is then said by officers to have sprinted off to her grandfather’s car, which also contained her mother, and urged him to drive away.

When he refused, she took the controls herself and drove off over a hillside, according to wpxi.com.

The news site said that police caught up with her and placed her in handcuffs in the back of a patrol car.

The drama is said to have begun when Rimer fled a Kohl's store (pictured) after being suspected of shoplifting

She then allegedly climbed through the glass partition, manoeuvred herself into the driver’s seat and put the car into gear.

Center Township Police Chief Barry Kramer said: ‘With her back turned and her hands cuffed behind her back, she manages to put it in gear and drive. And from what we can gather, she drove at very high speeds with that position, somehow manipulating the gears and steering the wheel.’

Kramer said she eventually ditched the patrol car and hitched a ride with someone, who dropped her off in Aliquippa.

The police cruiser was left with visible damage following the chase and several cars belonging to members of the public were reportedly rammed.

Kramer added: ‘Aliquippa police picked her up still in handcuffs. Thank god no one else was hurt.’

As she was being led to jail she told a Wpxi reporter ‘I don't remember anything but being in the back of a police car’.

Rimer faces several charges, including aggravated assault.
