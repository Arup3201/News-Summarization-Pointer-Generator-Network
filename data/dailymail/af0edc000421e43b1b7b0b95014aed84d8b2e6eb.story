A fisherman who was thrown from his boat eight miles from shore has miraculously been found alive after treading water for 18 hours.

Efstathios 'Steve' Moumouris, 51, was spotted on Thursday afternoon by a family who were out fishing for scallops in the Gulf of Mexico just off Crystal River. He is now recovering from dehydration.

Moumouris had texted his wife Anastasia around 1.30pm on Wednesday with an image showing him holding up a large fish. Shortly after, messaged again to tell her he was returning home.

But as he headed back to the shore, a storm rolled in and he was thrown from his 16-foot boat. In the chaos, he had been unable to grab a life jacket and had no option but to tread water.

When he failed to return home, his concerned wife contacted the Coast Guard at 8.30pm and they launched boats and helicopters to search 225 square miles.

He saw a helicopter over night and a shrimp boat at about 1am, but neither saw him, his wife told WTSP.

'He got 100 yards from it and they pulled up and left,' his wife said of the shrimp boat. 'And he swam, and he was just floating.'

'It was an intensive search, helicopters,
small boats combing the area. No sign of him,' U.S. Coast Guard Lt. 
Cmdr. Gabe Somma told ABC News.

Then at 4am on Thursday, his unmanned boat was found nine miles from the Fort Island boat ramp.

Eagle eyed: Ted Hoy had gone to check out something strange in the water and found Moumouris

As crews continued to search, fellow fisherman Ted Hoy and his family were out scalloping when they spotted something strange in the water around 1pm.

'I was driving…and we just looked and said what is that? We 
weren't sure so we headed that way,' Hoy said.

As they got closer, they realized there was a man treading water - almost 18 hours since Moumouris had been thrown overboard. Hoy said he was 'fairly coherent'.

He was able to let them know his wife's telephone number and she then called authorities.

Lt. Cmdr. Somma said: 'For someone treading water, he was in good 
condition, dehydrated but happy to be alive.... This is incredible he's alive.'

Joy: His wife Anastasia, pictured with Moumouris, said she knew if anyone would survive, it would be him

Celebration: After he was found, she shared this photo on Facebook showing the family celebrating

Moumouris, who has owned a Greek restaurant in Eustis for 26 years, was taken to shore, where he was treated for dehydration and kept overnight in hospital.

'Elated, elated. There are no words to describe it,' Anastasia Moumouris said. 'I said if anybody can make it, it would be him... I don't know what else to say. It’s a miracle, it really is.'

U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Petty Officer Crystalynn Kneen said health, fitness, age, height and weight influence the chance of survival in open water, adding that Moumouris was in good health.

'What do we plan to do?' his wife said to the Orlando Sentinel. 'Go back to work full time at the restaurant. That's what we do every day. This was just his day off that was extended by a day due to the circumstance.'
