When Rebecca Saxon was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the young age of 27, she thought her life was over.

But in her darkest hour, inspiration struck and she found a way of turning her adversity into advantage.

Following her cancer treatment, Rebecca launched a successful business 'Something Blue Bridal Shoes' - a unique range of wedding footwear, which emerged out of the fashion sketches she drew while recovering in her hospital bed.

Rebecca Saxon was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2010. Over two years of treatment she sketched shoes in her notepad to keep from being bored. After being given the all-clear, she turned the designs into real shoes and now sells them through a new online business 

Rebecca, from London, England, says: 'I started doing sketches of wedding shoes with blue soles when I was halfway through my cancer treatment. 

'I had a hit a real low and was going through that whole "Will I live or die?" situation.

'But I decided that I was going to pick myself up and fight this cancer. The sketches were my release and the way I got through the many hours spent in a hospital room.

'It was incredible when I realized I could turn my footwear designs into a commercial business. 

'After being given the all-clear, I set up SomethingBlueBridalShoes.com and I'm just so thrilled by how well the range has been received by customers.'

Rebecca, 31, was working as a marketing manager when she discovered a lump in her throat in 2010.

She explains: 'I immediately went to see my GP who referred me to a specialist who did a number of tests. 

Rebecca Saxon was diagnosed with Stage Two thyroid cancer and had to undergo two operations to remove ta lump and part of the gland, resulting in a scar on her neck (pictured)

'A few months along the line, the lump on my throat had got bigger, so I had to undergo surgery to get it and a small part of my thyroid removed.

'However when the results came back, they discovered that the lump was cancerous and I was diagnosed with Stage Two thyroid cancer. 

'When I received that diagnosis, I was just in a state of shock. I didn't know if the cancer had spread or what the future would hold for me.'

Following her diagnosis, Rebecca underwent a year-long intensive treatment which included two operations to have her thyroid gland removed, a course of hormone suppressants, further hospitalization and radiation treatment.

She says: 'I had to take leave from work and I was in and out of hospital. Mentally I was in a very dark place, sitting in my apartment day-after-day. 

Rebecca has designed all of her shoes with a distinctive blue sole, to integrate the 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue' tradition 

'I had no idea what was going to happen to me. But I knew I had to be positive if I was going to overcome this treatment. I told myself this was not going to be the end for me. I decided to channel my negative feelings and start drawing.

'I had always loved fashion and when I was younger, I would sketch with my Nana. 

'Several of my friends were getting married at the time so weddings were very much in the air. So initially, I would be drawing designs for bridal gowns and other garments.

'But then I started sketching wedding footwear - designing shoes with distinctive, blue soles which were super comfy too. I thought it would be a lovely way of integrating the 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue' tradition.

'Drawing really helped me deal with my treatment. 

'But I also began looking at turning my sketches into commercial ideas and realised that I could make a living out of my bridal shoes.

Rebecca now runs the business Something Blue Bridal Shoes

'From then on, every time I went to hospital, I took my sketch pad and laptop. I would immerse myself in my sketches and thrash out different business ideas.'

Rebecca was given the all-clear in August 2011. 

With the encouragement of her entrepreneur boyfriend, Mike Bandar, she then turned her dreams into her reality and set up 'Something Blue Bridal Shoes'.

Each gorgeous shoe from the collection has a blue sole, incorporating the age-old tradition of what a bride should wear at her wedding for good luck.

'My doctors were great. Even though I will have to be on medication for the rest of my life, I feel so lucky to be alive today and running a business which I love.

'I don't know if I would be doing this today if I hadn't gone through what I did. You never know where great ideas can come from and I hope I can inspire others.'
