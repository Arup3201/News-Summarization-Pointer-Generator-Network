Irish food safety chiefs kept British consumers in the dark for ten weeks after being tipped off about horsemeat in beefburgers, The Mail on Sunday has learned.

Officials have repeatedly insisted that horsemeat was only detected in the food chain after random inspection of products at Irish  plants in early November. It was claimed that the results came to light in trials of new DNA testing techniques.

But Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has now admitted the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef with horsemeat before last year’s tests and started investigating on that basis.

They did not alert their UK counterparts until mid-January, however, and food safety and industry chiefs are incensed by the delay. It meant thousands of British shoppers were duped by fraudsters and dined on burgers, lasagne and spaghetti bolognese laced with horse.

The Irish secrecy was revealed last week in a little-noticed exchange in the House of Commons. Mr Paterson told MPs: ‘The reason the Irish agency picked up this issue in the Irish plant was that it had local intelligence that there was a problem. That is why it did a random check – I cleared this with [Irish agriculture] Minister [Simon] Coveney.’

The lack of urgency from the Dublin authorities – who appear to have ignored an agreement to share intelligence with their counterparts in Northern Ireland – has provoked fury in Whitehall and throughout the food industry.

Enforcement chiefs are particularly frustrated because while the Food Safety Authority of Ireland informed the UK food watchdog about its tests in November, there was no suggestion horsemeat was being processed as beef.

Sloppiness: Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke said it was 'unacceptable' that food had been deliberately contaminated

The Irish first had test results 
indicating horsemeat in the beef supply chain on November 30. But 
instead of immediately alerting authorities in London and Belfast, Irish
officials sat on the results and decided to order more tests.

The
shocking discovery that a Tesco frozen value burger was adulterated 
with 29 per cent horsemeat was not announced until January 15. Even 
then, the FSA in the UK was told the Irish had not been acting on a 
specific tip-off.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‘It would have been much better to have given us the full picture. We asked the Irish a number of times and we have been told repeatedly the testing was not intelligence-led.’

Last night, however, Mr Paterson’s disclosure of the tip-off brought a confused response in Dublin. The FSAI repeated its assertion that it had not acted on specific intelligence but said it could not comment on ‘conversations between Ministers’. A spokesman for Mr Coveney’s Irish agriculture department also declined to comment.

Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke  told The Mail on Sunday: ‘What has happened is sloppiness at best and criminality at worst. We have found that in the areas where food was contaminated with products which shouldn’t have been there, it was deliberate. That is unacceptable.’

Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, said: ‘If Irish authorities knew horse was in the food chain last November, it was their duty to tell people about it.’

Tougher controls on food consignments traded within the European Union are expected to be agreed before the end of the month after the scandal spread to 12 EU states. Mr Paterson is also pushing for random checks. He said: ‘Too much is taken for granted under the present system.’

Three British factory bosses arrested over horsemeat allegations on Thursday were yesterday released on bail. Peter Boddy, 63, Dafydd Raw-Rees, 64, and Colin Patterson, 42, had been held at Aberystwyth on suspicion of fraud. Mr Boddy was taken for questioning to the Welsh town from his slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Mr Raw-Rees and Mr Patterson were arrested at nearby Farmbox Meats Ltd. A police spokesman said inquiries at Farmbox Meats would continue.
