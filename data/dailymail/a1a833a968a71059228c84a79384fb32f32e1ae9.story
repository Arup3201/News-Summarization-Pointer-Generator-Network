The police snooping scandal has deepened after claims forces used controversial surveillance laws to access phone records from major networks as easily as using a ‘cash machine’.

It comes after reports that officers have been using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to seize journalists’ phone records and find out their sources for at least 10 years.

In one case Suffolk police confirmed it had used the anti-terrorism power to obtain the phone records of a reporter at the East Anglian Daily Times who had asked questions about a rape investigation in December 2006.

Claims have surfaced that police used controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to obtain journalists' phones records from major networks as easily as using a 'cash machine'

Three quarters of the UK’s major mobile phone networks has been providing police with customers’ call records through automated systems, according to an investigation by the Guardian.

One phone company employee told the paper that the process being operated by EE, Vodafone and Three is like ‘a cash machine’.

The only big phone company which requires staff to review all police information requests is O2, according to transparency watchdog Privacy International.

Mobile operators must keep a year of call records of all of its customers by law. Police and other agencies are able to access the data without a warrant using Ripa – a law giving authority to most of GCHQ’s mass surveillance and originally intended to safeguard national security.

Software providers’ records have revealed the vast majority of requests by police were delivered without the involvement of phone company staff.

The incident in Suffolk saw police trawl through the phone records of crime reporter Mark Bulstrode, who now works at the BBC, after he questioned the force about the re-opening of a cold case rape investigation from the 1980s.

Boris Johnson backtracked on comments he recently made in defence of the police's actions

He was warned the report could jeopardise the investigation and the East Anglian Daily Times decided not to run it – but police still obtained his phone records to find out who his source had been.

Under a Data Protection Act, Mr Bulstrode requested access to records police held on him and made the discovery, which the paper and its sister publication, the Ipswich Star, reported on in December 2006.

However it was not known at the time that the records had been obtained using Ripa, which the force confirmed to media trade publication Press Gazette yesterday.

Speaking to the MailOnline on Saturday night, Mr Bulstrode said that he was 'disappointed' with the way the police had acted. 

He said: 'I was investigating a story that was in the public interest and I was disappointed that my phone records were accessed in this way when both I and the newspaper had acted in good faith throughout.' 

It comes as Boris Johnson backtracked on comments he had previously made in support of the police’s use of Ripa, now claiming it ‘crucial’ that journalists should be able to protect their sources.

Earlier this week the Mayor of London, who has responsibility for holding the Metropolitan Police to account, defended Scotland Yard for secretly seizing phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn while investigating the Plebgate row.

Speaking at the London Press Club Ball this week, he said: ‘It is absolutely vital for our country and for this city that we protect free speech - and, if I can say something about one current controversy, it is of course right that the police should be able to investigate serious criminal matters.

‘But it is also crucial that journalists should be able to protect their sources and to give whistleblowers the confidence to come forward and we will have to insist that in future the police will not be able to see a journalist's phone records without some kind of judicial approval.’

Police also used Ripa to secretly spy on The Mail On Sunday – trawling through thousands of confidential numbers called by journalists from a landline at the newsdesk extending back an entire year.

Police investigating former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne over his speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist

It was after shamed Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne falsely accused journalists of conspiring to bring him down but detectives decided to sidestep a judge’s agreement to protect the source for stories exposing Huhne for illegally conspiring to have his speeding points put on his wife’s licence.

Critics have argued that obtaining phone records in this way could create a state database of private communications, although politicians have made assurances it will not.

Former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, this week lashed out at police chiefs who defended the practice after he clashed with Andy Trotter, ex-chief constable of British Transport Police, who insisted there were ‘higher concerns’ than protecting whistleblowers who spoke to the media.

An inquiry has now been launched into how every police force in the country has used Ripa to track journalists phone calls.

The Home Office will look at police use of Ripa in relation to journalists as part of a wider review of the powers available under the Act to the police and Security Services which was announced earlier this year.
