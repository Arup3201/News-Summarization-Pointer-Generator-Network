A father-of-one who stood in a roundabout wearing a sign begging for a job is now its gardener.

Matt Atkins was advertising himself by holding a placard which read: ‘desperate 4 a job’, while standing in view of the busy traffic off the A127, in Basildon, Essex.

The 46-year-old now mows the grass on the roundabout after its sponsors, a cleaning firm, spotted his desperate plight.

Mow-ing up: Matt Atkins, 46, was hired after the father of one spent a day in the Essex roundabout Mr Dalton sponsors with a sign asking for a job - now he is its manager

Local cleaning company Bizzib, who advertise its services on the roundabout, gave Mr Atkins a job as a cleaner.

Seven months later, Mr Atkins has been promoted to landscape manager, with responsibility for the very same roundabout.

He
said: ‘It's quite bizarre that I have ended up back here. I never 
imagined I would come back to this roundabout. I still have to pinch 
myself sometimes but it is fantastic. Life is good.

‘I feel a million times better in myself. I just needed one person to believe in me.

‘Before
I was on anti-depressants and really fed up. I was not on a happy place
at all but now I am off the anti-depressants and doing something I 
love.’

Success story: Mr Atkins advertised himself with a 'desperate 4 a job' placard in May, and he now looks after the roundabout where he stood looking for work

Only way is Essex: Shortly after his stunt, Mr Atkins started as a cleaner and was promoted to landscape manager seven months later

Before taking the 
desperate measure of standing in busy traffic with a sign around his 
neck, Mr Atkins, from Wickford, had struggled to find employment for 
eight years.

He had been 
living on incapacity benefit since undergoing a pancreas transplant in 
2004, but wishing to provide for his wife Kelly and their 15-year-old son Levi 
the honest way, he took a pay cut to work with the cleaning firm.

Managing
director Ricky Dalton said: ‘He has been fantastic. His attitude 
towards work has been great and he has gone from strength to strength. 
He has seen visions for the company and brought ideas to the table which
some of us had never thought about.

‘When
I heard he was standing on our roundabout I thought if he was willing 
to do that he would have the ability to do what we asked him.

‘He
took a drop in wages to join us but we are a company that rewards 
people for results. The fact that Matt put himself out he was rewarded 
and we were rewarded with his hard work.’
