Mitt Romney emerged for a rare interview Sunday in which finally showed his disdain for jokes made on MSNBC last week at the expense of his infant son.

The former Republican presidential told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that liberal TV hosts like Melissa Harris-Perry are welcome to make jabs at him, but this one was below the belt.

'Children, you know, that’s beyond the line,' said the former Massachusetts governor and grandfather of 23.

'Beyond the line': Mitt Romney emerged for a rare interview Sunday in which he reacted to the comments made last week about his adopted black grandson Kieran

'Moving on': Though he made clear his belief that involving family in political discourse is reprehensible, the former presidential candidate refused to express further outrage over the comments

Romney graciously accepted the tearful apology Harris-Perry gave on Saturday after guests used the race of little Kieran Romney to make a political point.

'He was an answer to prayer,' Romney says of his son Ben's infant boy. 'I recognize that people make mistakes and the folks at MSNBC made a big mistake and they've apologized for it and that's all you can ask for.'

Romney kept his forgiving resolve, even as Wallace not-so-subtly tried to goad him into expressing a little more outrage.

'I suspect she took this somewhat more personally,' Wallace said, referring to Mrs. Romney, 'the idea that political discourse would include going after a little baby.'

'We hold no ill will whatsoever,' he said and reiterated that he and his family are 'moving on.'

Apology: MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry offered an apology to the Romneys and other inter-racial families

Harris-Perry started her weekend show
 with an apology after outrage over her guests' comments had built into a
 full blown scandal.

Complaints
 were made after panelists gave comic captions for photos of key moments
 in the past year, including a family portrait of Mitt Romney which 
showed his adopted African-American grandson.

After
 admitting the section was in poor judgment, the MSNBC host was close to
 crying as she apologized to the Romneys and other inter-racial 
families.

What had been meant as a fun review of the year spiraled into a segment where the youngest Romney, Kieran, became the butt of political jokes.

Comedian Dean Obeidallah had said: 'It really sums up the diversity of the 
Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black 
person.'

And actress Pia Glenn added: 'One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same.'

Although Harris-Perry, who is African-American, did not directly ridicule the baby, she said during her apology on MSNBC that the idea behind the segment was the result of 'poor judgment'.

'Given my own family history I identified with that picture and I intended to say positive and celebratory things,' she said.

'But whatever the intent was, the reality was the segment proceeded in a way that was offensive.'

She added: 'My intention was not malicious but I broke the ground rule that families are off limits.'

Forrmer Republican governor Sarah 
Palin was among those who criticized the show, saying  MSNBC 
should be ashamed of itself for allowing the segment to go to air.

'Leftist media hounds are not 
expressing an opinion with this attack; they are expressing a prejudice 
that would never be accepted if it came from anyone else but the 
lib[eral] media,' Palin wrote on her Facebook page in a post 
accompanying the photo of the Romney family.

In the broadcast of her apology, Harris-Perry's voice cracked with emotion as she said the core principle of her show was to advocate diversity.

She said: 'I am deeply sorry that we suggested that inter-racial families are in anyway funny or deserving of ridicule.'

Harris-Perry responded to her critics, saying she was 'genuinely appreciative of everyone who offered criticisms' and adding: 'I am reminded that our fiercest critics can sometimes be our best teachers.'

Obeidallah has also sought to defend himself in an article on the Daily Beast.

He said he had received scores of nasty tweets from people calling him a 'baby-bullying bigot.'

'You may think [my joke was]funny, unfunny, cliché, idiotic, etc. Comedy is subjective,' he wrote.

'But say what you will about my quip, I didn't criticize the Romney family for adopting the baby nor did I mock baby Kieran in any way. Nor would I.

'My joke was about the lack of racial diversity we see at the Republican National Convention - a topic lampooned for years by comedians.'
