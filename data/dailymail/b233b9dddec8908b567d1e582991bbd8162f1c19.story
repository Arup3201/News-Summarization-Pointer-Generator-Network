There are some bizarre friendships in the animal world and probably none more bizarre than that between a green tree frog and a snail.

The unlikely pair living in Jakarta, Indonesia and the frog is a pet belonging to photographer Lessy Sebastian, 50.

Mr 
Sebastian went into his outdoor studio to take some pics of his pet frog when he
 saw the snail approaching the amphibian as it sat on a tree branch.

Nice and easy does it: The snail approaches the green tree frog

The snail reaches out as the frog seems happy to give the mollusc a helping head

He was shocked when the frog lowered its body so the snail could slither up and onto its head where it perched happily, and the new friends even posed for photographs.

'This green tree frog is my own frog and on this occasion I went outside to try and snap some nice photographs of him enjoying the sun,â€™ said Mr Sebastian.

Top o' the world, ma, top o' the world: The snail sits happily on the amphibian's head
