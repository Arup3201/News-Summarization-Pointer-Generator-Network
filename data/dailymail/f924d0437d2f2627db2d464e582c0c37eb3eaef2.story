Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini has insisted there is a lot more to come from him at Old Trafford.

The 27-year-old Belgian had a difficult start to life at the club, failing to score in 21 appearances last season, but he told The Sun it wasn't just himself who struggled under David Moyes last campaign.

'Last season was a bad season for everyone, not just me,' said Fellaini. 'The criticism went to me because I was the first transfer of  Moyes. I accept that.

'But it's a team game. The team wasn't performing well, we didn't win. It was hard.'

Fellaini also admitted he felt sorry for his former boss Moyes, who brought him to Manchester United in a deadline day deal after working together for five years at Everton.

'You have to win if you want to stay as manager,' the midfielder added. 'Last year was a bad experience for him.'

2014/15 has marked a vast improvement in Fellaini's form, scoring three times in 13 appearances so far. And he believes he can continue to show United fans faithful what he's made of, starting with the trip to Upton Park to play West Ham on Sunday.

'Last year was a bad experience. Sometimes it's just like that. I accept it. 

'I just want to play. And there is a lot more to come from me.'
