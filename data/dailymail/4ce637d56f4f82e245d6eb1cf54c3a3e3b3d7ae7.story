French politicians have been accused of trying to ‘offload’ Syrian refugees on Britain in a growing row over who should give them asylum.

Scores of Syrians have occupied the Calais ferry terminal including a dozen who are on hunger strike and two threatening to kill themselves if they are not given safe passage to Britain.

But a French MEP has come under fire after urging the European Parliament to back their call to be allowed into Britain.

Hunger strike: Some of the Syrians occupying a footbridge at the Calais ferry terminal

Unlike Britain, France does not pay benefits to asylum seekers while their claims are being processed. About 40 Syrians have refused to move from a passenger gangway.

Ahead of a debate in Brussels, French MEP Hélène Flautre wrote to all MEPs with a message from the refugees in which they complain they are sleeping outside 'just because we have chosen to go and live in England'.

She said: ‘Considering the debate we have today on the EU's response to the flow of refugees as a result of the conflict in Syria, I would like to convey the call from Syrians who are now in Calais (France) and want to reach Britain to apply for asylum.’

But British politicians are outraged at the suggestion that France should not take responsibility for people in their own country while viewing the UK as a ‘soft touch’.

UKIP MEP Gerard Batten wrote back to Miss Flautre: 'Since they are already in France why don't you propose that France offers them asylum?'

'First of all, we are very thankful to what have already been done for the Syrian people who suffer from disastrous killing.

'Children, women, men and even animals and plants are being killed or destroyed. So, we feel that there are some sides which are being fed on the Syrian blood because till now no one can stop this terrible war.

'Firstly, we want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the Syrians are facing in some parts of Europe especially in France and Italy.

'For example, in Calais, France, we are sleeping outside and have no food or shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen to go and live in England. In other hand, in Italy the police take our prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else.

'Secondly, we hope all European countries to do what Sweden has done to save the Syrian people. We also hope to make the asylum procedure faster to reunion and stop the pain.

'The Syrians in Calais are insisting to go to England which we want to show that it stands and support the Syrian people and it should try to find a way to take us from Calais, France.

'Finally, we need immediate action in order to save humanity and peace in Syria.

'We also beg you to do it fast because our families are living in a bad situation and we need to go to England as fast as possible to work and send them money.'

Mr Batten, the UK Independence Party’s spokesman on security and defence, said later: ‘The suggestion that Syrian refugees in Calais should be sent post-haste to England is absolutely outrageous.

‘These people have made their way across Europe with the intention of landing up in the UK. This is contrary to the UN Convention on Refugees that says they should seek refuge in the first safe country they come to.

‘They want to come to Britain because of our reputation as a soft touch. They may indeed be refugees, but they are attracted to Britain because of the generous housing, benefits, and social services systems made available to foreigners.

‘If they French have not prevented their entry into France, as they were entitled to do under the Convention, then the French should offer them asylum, not try to offload the problem onto the UK.’

When French riot police tried to 
clear the refugees at the weekend, two men climbed on to the roof of the ferry ticket
hall and threatened to jump.

Others erected placards reading: ‘We want to start a new life in England’ and ‘We want to talk to David Cameron’.

Many said Britain was a ‘better’ place to settle, despite Syria’s close historical links with France.

In the message circulated to MEPs, in broken in English, the Syria's describe themselves as being 'stucked in France'.

They add: 'We want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the Syrians are facing in some parts of Europe especially in France and Italy.

'For example, in Calais, France, we are sleeping outside and have no food or shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen to go and live in England.

'In other hand, in Italy the police take our prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else.

'We also beg you to do it fast because our families are living in a bad situation and we need to go to England as fast as possible to work and send them money.'
