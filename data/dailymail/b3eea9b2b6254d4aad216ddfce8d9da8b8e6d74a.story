Spending the morning with George Clooney is an attractive prospect to millions, but GMA host Lara Spencer found the Hollywood star's presence too much on Thursday.

With Clooney say by her side, the Good Morning America presenter found herself in a fluster as she tried to deliver a piece about a new sex aid.

The 44-year-old was left giggling like a schoolgirl after talking about an injection said to improve sexual satisfaction for women.

Spencer ended up covering her face with her hands after struggling to keep her composure as a bemused Clooney sat just inches from her side.

The Oscar-winning star had been invited on the show to talk about his new movie, The Monuments Men, which is set in the Second World War.

Clooney wrote and directed the film, which is about a platoon tasked with recovering precious art stolen by the Nazis. The actor stars in it alongside Matt Damon, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett.

As Spencer tried to introduce a segment on the show about the O-shot - a new injection said to increase a woman's libido - she stumbled with her words and looked embarrassed.

The GMA host later posed on Twitter: 'O--MG! Thanks for making me do a tease about the "O-shot" while trying to maintain composure next to #GeorgeClooney'.

She clearly enjoyed having the actor in the studio, and later posted a picture of her standing with Clooney, and tweeted: 'It is wrong to want this in poster size?'
