A Brooklyn building owner has hired security guards and installed a metal gate to protect a work by the elusive British graffiti artist Banksy.

The rolling gate went up Friday over a wall in the Williamsburg neighborhood where Banksy spray-painted two geishas strolling over a 'bridge' formed by a basement window arch and a bonsai tree spread beneath them.

The security measures were taken after a rogue tagger spray-painted over the work and was tackled to the ground by the crowd.

Installation: The owners of the building have installed plexiglass and a roller-door to protect the Banksy stencil on their wall

Opening hours: The owners are exercising some crowd control for the hoards who have gathered outside the south Williamsburg building to view the Banksy piece

Others undertook damage control, removing the offending black scribble with rubbing alcohol.

Cara Tabachnick, whose family owns the building, write in New York Magazine that her father sent her a text on Thursday morning saying, 'Banksy painted our building last night and a huge crowd is forming. What should we do?'

It's not a question to be taken lightly.

Banksy canvases sell for upwards of $1 million and art-lovers collect his work with feverish zeal.

Just an hour after the work was discoverd, the tagger defaced it and friends and neighbors urged the family to take measures to protect the work.

Tabachnick says that she and her family realized that they had unwittingly become responsible for a piece of public art.

Secure: The piece has drawn crowds of people since it appeared Thursday morning

Under guard: Feliciano Perez guards the work by British graffiti artist Banksy today in the Brooklyn borough of New York

Tagged: The work was up for less than an hour before a tagger, seen here in a purple scarf, spray painted over it. Two bystanders tried to stop the vandal

Japanese themed: The work uses a brick window archway on the side of a building in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, to stand in for a bridge

Thwarted: The building superintendent is seen here throwing the tagger to the ground. He called police, but the rival graffiti artist escaped

By late Thursday morning, word had spread and more than 500 people had gathered to view the stencil.

The family hired a security guard to stand watch over the artwork, and several more to cover the night shift.

Police
and local councilmen weren't interested in helping the family protect 
their new acquisition, so they took matters into their own hands.

'We
still haven’t 100 per cent decided what to do,' Tabachnick told the
New York Post .

'But we do have the instinct - and are trying - to preserve it for
the public so it can be viewed and enjoyed, and not destroyed in any 
way.'

Although the work is 
apparently being preserved for the viewing public, new pictures show the
family has imposed some opening and closing hours.

Photos
posted to an Instagram account show a sign over the roller door (which 
covers a sheet of protective plexiglass) informing people that the door
will come up for viewing at 3pm.

Banksy
has caused quite a stir in the Big Apple, where he's undertaking a 
monthlong 'residency.' New Yorkers wake every morning to discover a new 
work adorning some corner of the city.

Defacing street art: The tagger who scrawled over Banksy's work was tackled to the ground by a crowd who had gathered to see the piece

Other
building owners have also been quick to preserve what could be a big 
money-spinner, or less cynically, a piece of art for public enjoyment.

A
small stencil of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa was covered in plexiglass 
and another Banksy of a heart-shaped balloon is under guard and welded 
steel.

Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg said last week that graffiti ruins property and is 'a sign of 
decay,' but  said the NYPD is not actively searching for the artful 
artist.

In
the 19 days since Bansky came to New York City for a so-called 
residency, fans of his work have had to race against taggers, who are 
intent on covering it with their own marks.

Some
of the taggers see Banksy as an interloper intruding on their turf, while some see him as a sell-out. Still others get a thrill out of putting their own mark on work by such a 
famous artist.
