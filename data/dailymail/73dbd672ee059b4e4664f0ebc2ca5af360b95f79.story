Dolphins are being trained for military action by the Ukraine navy in a return to Soviet-style underwater warfare, it emerged yesterday.

The marine mammals will be taught to attack enemy combat swimmers using special knives or pistols fixed to their heads, said a source in Sevastopol, a large port on the Black Sea.

They are also able to locate items of military interest and mark them by attaching buoys, or plant explosives in enemy territory.

Dolphins were trained at Sevastopol for 
the Soviet Navy from 1973, but when the country collapsed two decades 
ago they were redeployed to work with disabled 
children.

'Ten dolphins are now being trained for special tasks in the Ukrainian State Oceanarium,' the source revealed.

'The Ukrainian military are regularly training the animals for detecting things on the seabed.'

In Soviet times, dolphins were used to locate mines on the seabed and attack divers. They could carry explosives on their heads to plant them on enemy ships.

It is unclear why Ukraine feels the need to restore the 'unit' of naval dolphins in the Black Sea.Â

Unusually, it shares the famous port of Sevastopol with the Russian Navy.

Several exercises have been carried out this year both in an aquarium and on the open sea.

'The missions were successfully carried out,' said the naval source.

'Our dolphins found the items and attached devices to them which were fixed on their heads, after which a buoy on it was sent to the surface to mark it.'

The former top secret military base on the Crimean peninsula became a leading place for dolphin-therapy - a controversial alternative technique to soothe ailments - after the Soviet collapse.

Dolphins who previously were engaged in military service turned their highly trained minds away from office to helping cure children with a range of problems from nightmares to autism to cerebral palsy.

The U.S. Navy trained dolphins for military use in Virginia as part of its Marine Mammal Program.

It is important that handlers are able to bond with the marine mammals and examine them for any heath issues.
