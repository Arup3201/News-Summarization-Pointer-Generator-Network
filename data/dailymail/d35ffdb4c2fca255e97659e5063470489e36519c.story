A heroic nurse tore strips off her own clothing to save a crash victim from bleeding to death in a fuel-soaked van that could have exploded at any time.

Louise Price, 31, risked her own life by climbing into the wreckage to reach trapped passenger Adam Brinkworth, 49.

She used strips of her skirt to make tourniquets to stem his bleeding then gave CPR until an ambulance arrived.

Courage: Nurse Louise Price, 31 tore strips off her own clothing to save a car crash victim from bleeding to death in a fuel-soaked van

Mrs Price works as a psychiatric nurse but had to do first aid as part of her basic training and the crash was the first time she had ever had to use it.

The Royal Humane Society said her improvised emergency treatment and bravery saved Mr Brinkworth's life and have given Mrs Price an award for courage.

The mother-of-one was driving behind a white van at night when when it suddenly flipped over at speed.

Victim: Adam Brinkworth, 49, became trapped after his van flipped over at high speed

She said: 'It was frightening. The first thing I did was stop the car, turn it around and shine the lights on the crash.

'The van driver got out covered in blood, screaming that his friend was trapped in the van.

I started tearing my clothes, trying to make tourniquets to stop the bleeding.

'I had to clamber into the back of the van to get to him, and as the doors shut behind me it was full of smoke.

'He was in a terrible state, his teeth were smashed, his jaw was broken. His arm looked broken and bent the other way.

'There was blood everywhere from a hole in his skull, and I was trying to find out who he was when he stopped breathing.

'I had to start performing CPR to save him, and I stayed with him for 40 minutes until the emergency services arrived.

'I'd never done anything like that, but all I could keep thinking was I had to do my best or he was going to die in front of me.

'It was a night I'll never forget, I never thought he was going to make it, there was so much blood.'

Police confirmed that a petrol leak meant there was a 'real danger' of the van exploding at any time.

Mrs Price said: 'It was like when you see it in the action movies when you see it all going up and we could have both been in trouble, but I didn't really think about myself.'

The nurse was driving between Newport and Ystrad Mynach in South Wales when she witnessed the crash.

She is to receive a Royal Humane Society testimonial and resuscitation certificate - one of the country's top civilian honours for bravery in a life-or-death situation.

Mrs Price, of Merthyr Tydfil, has since met up with Mr Brinkworth and the pair have become firm friends.

She said: 'He says that the one thing he could remember from the night was my voice talking to him, and I have a very distinctive voice.

'To be honest, my award is just seeing him alive today, loving life with family and children.

I don't know how I feel about being called a hero, but I feel honoured to receive the awards and to be thought about in that way.'
