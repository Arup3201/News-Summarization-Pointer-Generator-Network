Juventus are starting to lose patience in the race to sign Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski and are instead stepping up their efforts to sign Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri, according to Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport.

The Serie A giants are keen on signing Podolski on loan with a view to a permanent deal but have identified Shaqiri as another potential target if they cannot seal a deal for the Arsenal man.

Shaqiri remains behind the likes of Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller in Bayern Munich's pecking order which could make the Swiss international available to seal a switch away from the Allianz Arena before the transfer window shuts next Monday.

They also include a transfer line in which they link Tottenham's Sandro with a move to Napoli.

La Gazzetta dello Sport believe Juventus are keen on signing either Falcao or Manchester United's Javier Hernandez during the closing stages of the transfer window.
