Ukip leader Nigel Farage once acted as a chauffeur for the notorious Tory pariah Enoch Powell.

Mr Farage picked up the former Conservative MP in 1993 so he could deliver a speech in a crunch by-election.

The revelation comes after it emerged Mr Farage once pleaded with the radical anti-immigration politician to help him win a seat in Parliament.

The Ukip leader also twice asked him to stand as a candidate in the 1990s. On both occasions Mr Powell rejected the request.

Mr Farage wrote a personal letter to the former Tory right-winger asking for his support in the Eastleigh by-election in 1994, where a 29-year-old Mr Farage was making his first bid for Parliament.

Mr Farage has never hidden his admiration for Mr Powell, who became a political pariah in 1968 after railing against immigration in his ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech. 

He simply shrugged this week when the comedian Russell Brand attacked him on live TV as a ‘pound shop Enoch Powell’.

But the letter, found by the Daily Telegraph in the archives of Cambridge University, shows how he actively sought Mr Powell’s support. 

Writing from his home in Kent, Mr Farage said: ‘I have everything in place to fight a good, aggressive campaign but a voice from you could transform things.’

The letter came after Mr Farage drove Mr Powell to a rally at Newbury Racecourse, where the former Tory was giving a speech.

Mr Farage said he was asked to drive Mr Powell because he had a fancy car.

The Ukip leader said: ‘He had spoken at my school and I was later asked to drive him to a by-election rally, I think they chose me because everyone else available had a Morris Minor and I had a Merc! It was scary.

'Protesters smashed the back of the car when we arrived but Enoch didn’t blink.’

They met again a few months later in Bow, East London. Mr Powell, who died in 1998, turned down Mr Farage’s request after giving the matter ‘very serious consideration’.

The following year, Mr Powell was invited to stand as a Ukip candidate in the 1995 European Parliament election, and then in the 1997 general election. 

He rejected both requests. But he did go on to give his backing to three Ukip candidates in the mid-1990s.

Mr Farage has described Mr Powell as a ‘political hero’. 

He said last month that the ‘general point’ of Mr Powell’s speech about the impact of immigration had been ‘absolutely right’ – but conceded his prediction of violent racial clashes had ‘thank God’ proved to be wrong.
