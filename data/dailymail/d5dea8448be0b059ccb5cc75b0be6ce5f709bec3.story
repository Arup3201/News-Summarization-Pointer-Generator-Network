The Northern Lights have lit up the skies above Scotland, Canada and Norway after the biggest solar storm in more than six years bombarded Earth with radiation.

The Canadian Space Agency posted a geomagnetic storm warning on Tuesday after residents were also treated to a spectacular show in the night sky.

Ken Kennedy, director of the Aurora section of the British Astronomical Association, said that the lights, also known as the aurora borealis, may be visible for a few more days.

The Northern Lights are caused by particles  from the sun colliding with atoms in the outer reaches of Earth’s atmosphere, 60 to 200 miles up.These particles stream away from the sun at speeds of about 1million mph after events called 'coronal mass ejections' on the sun's surface, and are drawn to Earth’s northern and southern poles by its magnetic field.Which atoms the electrons encounter when they hit the Earth – either oxygen or nitrogen – and the altitude at which they meet, determine whether the colours are green, red, blue or purple.The lights have been seen so far south because the solar explosion that sent out the particles was particularly strong.

The Northern Lights are sometimes seen
 from northern parts of Scotland but the unusual solar activity this 
week means the lights have also been visible from as far south as northeast England, a rarity.

Geomagnetic storms cause awesome sights, but they can also bring trouble.

According to the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, problems can include current surges in power
 lines, and interference in the broadcast of radio, TV and telephone 
signals.

Radiation from Sunday's flare arrived
 at Earth an hour later and will probably continue through until 
Wednesday, NOAA experts say. Levels are considered strong but other storms have been more
 severe.

There are two higher levels of 
radiation on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's storm
 scale of ‘severe’ and ‘extreme’, space weather centre physicist Doug 
Biesecker said.

This storm is the strongest 
for radiation since May 2005. The radiation - in the form of protons - 
came flying out of the sun at 93 million miles per hour.

‘The whole volume of space between 
here and Jupiter is just filled with protons and you just don't get rid 
of them like that,’ he said, explaining why the effects will stick 
around for a couple of days.

NASA's flight surgeons and solar experts examined the solar flare's expected effects.

They decided that the six astronauts 
on the International Space Station do not have to do anything to protect
 themselves from the radiation, spokesman Rob Navias said.

A solar eruption is followed by a 
one-two-three punch, said Antti Pulkkinen, a physicist at NASA's Goddard
 Space Flight Center in Maryland and Catholic University.

First comes electromagnetic 
radiation, followed by radiation in the form of protons. Then, finally 
the coronal mass ejection - that's the plasma from the sun itself - 
hits.

Usually that travels at about 1 or 2 
million miles per hour, but this storm is particularly speedy and is 
shooting out at 4 million miles per hour, Mr Biesecker said.

Plasma causes much of the noticeable 
problems on Earth, such as electrical grid outages. In 1989, a solar 
storm caused a massive blackout in Quebec. It can also pull the northern
 lights further south.

But this coronal mass ejection seems 
likely to be only moderate, with a chance for becoming strong, Mr 
Biesecker said. The worst of the storm is likely to go north of Earth.
