Signal: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg left the door firmly open to further welfare reform yesterday

Nick Clegg has signalled he is prepared to consider Tory calls to cut the £26,000 household benefit cap and limit child-related benefits for the jobless - but only if the axe is also taken to pensioners’ perks.

The Deputy Prime Minister left the door firmly open to further welfare reform yesterday, saying it was inevitable that more would have to be done in the years ahead.

Chancellor George Osborne has indicated that ‘billions’ more in cuts to social security will be necessary after the next election, on top of the £18billion already introduced.

Tories have floated a possible reduction in the £26,000 household benefit cap, introduced by the Government this year so that it is not possible to earn more in welfare than on average earnings, and limits on child benefit and other payments for unemployed parents who have more than two children in future.

Mr Clegg said it would not be fair to remove child-related benefits from those already in receipt of them, but refused to oppose either idea in principle, agreeing that further reform of the welfare state will be necessary.

‘I’m not going to start drawing great circles around this policy or that policy. I want to look at it in the round,’ the Deputy Prime Minister said.

On a lower benefit cap, he added: ‘It’s not something that I’m advocating at the moment because we’ve only just set this new level and it’s £26,000, which is equivalent to earning £35,000 before tax…

‘I think we need to keep that approach, look and see how it works, see what the effects are, but not rush to start changing the goalposts before the policy has properly settled down.’

However, Mr Clegg insisted that pensioners’ free TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel payments would also have to be reviewed after the next general election.

Labour has already said it would stop paying better-off older people some allowances, which the Tories pledged to protect till 2015.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said that the party would also end winter fuel payments, normally worth £200 for the over-60s and £300 for those over the age of 80, to 600,000 better-off pensioners, while the Liberal Democrats have long argued pensioner benefits should be reined in.

Future: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is among those who are understood to believe that continuing to pay benefits to wealthy pensioners cannot be justified beyond the next election

There is no question of winter fuel payments, free bus passes and TV licences being means tested until after 2015, because David Cameron made a cast iron pledge at the last election that they would be left untouched.

However, there are significant internal disagreements in the Conservative Party over whether the Prime Minister should repeat his pledge to ring-fence the payments at the next election, binding his hands until 2020.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is among those who are understood to believe that continuing to pay benefits to wealthy pensioners cannot be justified beyond the next election.

Research commissioned by Downing Street suggests that a majority of the public back the idea of slashing handouts for better off pensioners.

But the polling also confirms that the Prime Minister risks a ‘crisis of trust’ if he breaks his pledge, at least before the next election.

Mr Clegg said: ‘I have pushed within coalition but I have given up now because Conservatives don’t want to know, really.

‘I don’t think there is any realistic prospect of getting anything delivered on that in the next 18 months. I have pushed both George Osborne and David Cameron but it is something they don’t want to do, for reasons they will have to explain to you.’

Mr Clegg said that pensions minister Steve Webb and Cabinet Office minister David Laws were working on ‘very useful’ ideas on reforming universal pensioner benefits, adding: ‘As we put together the Liberal Democrat manifesto, we will make some announcements on this.’

The Liberal Democrat leader said that stripping wealthy pensioners of their benefits would not raise enormous amounts of money but would be ‘symbolically important’.
