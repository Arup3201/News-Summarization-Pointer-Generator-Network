A 90-year-old Ohio man has been sentenced to four years in prison for killing his wife of 65 years — but he could be released after serving six months.

Robert Shaw from the Cleveland suburb of Avon was originally charged with aggravated murder for smothering his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, in November 2008.

He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in June as part of a plea deal.

Shaw is eligible for early 
release after he serves six months in prison under the terms of the deal
 he struck in June with prosecutors that saw him plead guilty to 
involuntary manslaughter.

Jailed: Robert Shaw, 90, who killed his wife in what has been described as a mercy killing, has been sentenced to four years in jail by Judge Mark Betleski court at Lorain County Justice Center

He
 originally was charged with aggravated murder, murder and felonious 
assault for smothering 84-year-old Virginia Shaw on Nov. 13, 2008. 
So-called 'mercy killings' are illegal under Ohio law.

Shaw’s defense has long been 
that the death of his wife was a mercy killing to end the suffering she 
was enduring because of her many medical problems, which had caused her 
to be in and out of the hospital in the months leading up to her death.

At 7:20 a.m. Nov. 12, 2008, Shaw phoned a 911 operator to say he had just killed his wife.

When
 police arrived at Shaw’s home, he surrendered and was taken to a 
hospital for weeks of evaluation and observation, according to earlier 
news reports of the incident.

On the 911 recording, Shaw can be heard saying 'I just killed my wife' because he wanted 'to put her out of her misery.'

When the 911 operator asks how he killed her, Shaw replied, 'I suffocated her.'

'How, with a pillow or a blanket?' the dispatcher asked.

'Yes,' Shaw said.

Shaw’s voice faltered as he explained what happened.

'She had been in and out of the hospital and came home a couple of months ago, and ... uh ... I can’t talk ...'

Helping hand: Mr Shaw's lawyer (left) said, 'He lived a law-abiding life his entire life. Our hope is that he¿ll be released promptly.'

Police arrivedthrough an unlocked door to find Shaw sitting at a table. He told officers that they could find his wife in the bedroom.

Lorain County Coroner Dr. Paul Matus 
performed an autopsy on 84-year-old Virginia Shaw and said she appeared 
to die by asphyxiation.

The couple had been married for 65 years, Lieux said.

Shaw's daughter thanked prosecutors and the Lorain County judge during a hearing Monday for how they treated their father.

'My sister and I would just like to thank
 you, your honor, Dennis Will and the (Lorain County) prosecutor’s 
office for your kind understanding of our father’s situation,' said 
Carol Patsko, the Shaws’ daughter.

'We truly appreciate everyone’s 
effort on his behalf and ours.'

Speaking from the bench, Betleski
 said an early release is not guaranteed but he generally accepts joint 
recommendations of the prosecution and defense attorneys in criminal 
cases.

'It was clear upon review of the 
pre-sentence investigation report this was a situation that Mr. Shaw did
 not feel voluntarily involved with, but felt the circumstances with 
regard to his wife’s health necessitated his actions, albeit illegal, 
are certainly a consideration that has to be appreciated by the court,' 
Betleski said.

Shaw's attorney had said his client killed his sick wife to end her suffering caused by medical problems.

Shaw, clad in matching gray shirt and pants and black shoes, made no statement to Judge Mark Betleski.

The attorney said Monday his client accepts responsibilities for his actions and is at peace with the sentence.

'It’s definitely been difficult for the family on both sides,' said defense attorney Kenneth Lieux.

'Their daughters both lost their mother and their father is going to prison for a period of time.'

'He lived a law-abiding life his entire life,' Lieux said about Shaw. 'Our hope is that he’ll be released promptly.'

The situation was difficult for Shaw’s family, who had supported him since he called police to the home he shared with his high school sweetheart.

Shaw isn’t in the best health himself and had been free on bond while the case against him has been pending.

The Army veteran fought at the Battle of the Bulge in Europe and was retired from a job in truck manufacturing.

As part of his defense he said his wife had been in and out of hospital and 'just wanted to die'

Although sentenced to four years in jail, he could be out within six months given his age and blemish-free past
