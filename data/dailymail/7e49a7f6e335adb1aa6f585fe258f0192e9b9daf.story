Derek Wildeman, 42, was savagely beaten at his home in Blackburn after telling a boy off when his curtains were set on fire

A man with learning difficulties who told a teenage boy off for setting fire to his curtains was beaten so savagely he will never be able to speak or look after after himself again.

Derek Wildeman, 42, was attacked by Steven Quigley, 31, and his uncle Gary Quigley, 43, after he shouted at a 13-year-old boy over vandalism to his terraced house in Blackburn, Lancashire.

The men, who were jailed yesterday at Preston Crown Court, beat Mr Wildeman so badly he suffered multiple fractures to the head and face and was left in a coma for six months.  Eight months on, he still needs 24-hour care and his mother says his life is effectively over.

The attack took place on February 24 this year, when Mr Wildeman noticed at midnight that someone had reached through his boarded-up window and set fire to his net curtains at the home he shared with his two dogs.

He put the flames out and went onto the street, where he saw a boy walking past with two friends.

After an exchange of words the 13-year-old boy ran away and went to find Quigley who recruited his uncle, Gary, to help him get revenge on Mr Wildeman.

After telling the boy he was going to smash Mr Wildeman's 'head in', Steven Quigley put on a black hat and gloves and, taking the teenager with them, went to Mr Wildeman's house at 2am.

The court heard how Quigley climbed through a window and laid into the man whom neighbours described as a 'friendly loner' who 'wouldn't harm a fly'.

A
neighbour who witnessed the attack saw Quigley land at least four or five blows on Mr Wildeman's upper body or head and repeatedly kick him as he lay on the carpet until a 
man was overheard shouting: 'That’s enough.'

The victim was so badly injured he had an operation to remove a blood clot from his brain.

He
is currently in a rehabilitation centre in Burnley where he is in a 
minimally responsive state and doctors say he is unlikely to recover from his 
injuries.

Mr Wildeman was so badly injured in the attack he was left in coma with multiple fractures to the head and face and needed complex surgery.

Now his prognosis is poor and he is being assessed to determine if he is in a persistent vegetative state. He cannot eat, drink, speak or do anything for himself now and will need 24-hour care.

Yesterday Steven Quigley was jailed for life after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He must serve a minimum of six years before being considered for release and will remain on licence for the rest of his life.

The court heard he had a string of previous convictions for violence including assault, harassment, and criminal damage.

Judge Pamela Badley told Quigley: 
'There is a significant risk to the public of serious injury caused by 
you committing further offences. I am unable to say when it will be safe
for you to be released.

'Derek
Wildeman did not say anything that might have provoked you during the 
assault and he did not put up any resistance or retaliation.'

'He has suffered 
catastrophic injuries and it is evident and it is evident that his life 
in any normal sense is over. This was a sustained attack.'

Gary Quigley pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm and was jailed for 20 months.

After the case Mr Wildeman’s mother Isabelle, 65, said: 'Steven Quigley is not safe to be on the streets for what he did to my son. Derek is now effectively a cabbage and it makes me so sad.

'I went to see him yesterday and it’s sad not being able to hear him speak. He hasn’t really made any improvement in eight months. He’s never going to recover properly and will need 24-hour care for the rest of his life and he’s only 42.'

'I can’t come to terms with what has happened to my son. I am at the hospital every day and have been since he was admitted. My only concern is my son.

'What does the future hold? Steven Quigley had effectively killed him in all but name.'

A neighbour of Mr Wildeman said: 'The fact is kids were taunting him and setting his curtains on fire.

'They picked on him because he was a loner and he had learning difficulties. He was quiet but he always said hello and was very friendly. He had two dogs and his mum used to visit him.

'He would just go along on his merry way and talk to everyone. He didn’t look like he would harm a fly. - there wasn’t a bad word you could say about him.'
