Insurgents killed six Afghan soldiers in an assault on Camp Bastion that lasted more than 14 hours, a day after attacks on foreign targets in Kabul killed two British embassy employees.

Nearly 30 insurgents, including seven suicide bombers, swarmed the camp in southern Helmand province in the early hours of Friday morning, said the deputy head of the Afghan National Army in the province, Ghulam Farooq Parwani.

British forces handed over Camp Bastion to the Afghan army in late October as part of a transition that will see the U.S. and Nato combat mission end on December 31. The Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's attack.

In April a report said that blunders by British commanders were 'devastatingly exploited' by the Taliban to carry out an attack on Camp Bastion while Prince Harry was there. 

Complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate, allowing heavily-armed insurgents to storm the supposedly impregnable UK base in 2012.

The defence select committee was also scathing about the Ministry of Defence, accusing officials of being ‘obstructive and unhelpful’ in the face of the committee’s inquiries to establish what had happened.

Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops – eight US and eight British – injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets and three vehicles.

Prince Harry was stationed at Bastion to fly Apache attack helicopters.

The committee found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years.

Prince Harry was based at Camp Bastion in his role as an Apache Helicopter pilot/gunner and was there when the Taliban attacked it in 2012

Troops were exposed to ‘unnecessary risk’ because UK commanders, who were responsible for security, had not put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure a Taliban attack was foiled.

Following a US investigation into the incident, two generals were ordered to quit. 

Also in Helmand Friday, two police officers were killed and two wounded in a suicide attack on their vehicle in Nawzad district, local police spokesman Ahmad Obaid said.

In eastern Nangahar province, 31 people were wounded when a mosque was bombed during Friday prayers, said Niamatullah Noorzai the chief of volatile Khogyani district. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Afghan government's support for a continued international military presence has incensed the insurgents, who are intensifying their war against the administration of President Ashraf Ghani.

Immediately after his September inauguration, Ghani signed bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and Nato, and he has made clear his intention bring peace to Afghanistan, which has been at war for the past 30 years.

Kabul has seen almost daily attacks in recent weeks, as insurgents turn their attention to foreign targets.

On Thursday, a suicide attacker in a car filled with explosives struck a British embassy vehicle on a busy road in the east of the capital, killing a British security guard and an Afghan driver.

Late Friday evening, a complex attack, also claimed by the Taliban, was launched against a guesthouse occupied by a U.S. logistics contractor, Aecom Technology Corporation, according to police and security officials.
