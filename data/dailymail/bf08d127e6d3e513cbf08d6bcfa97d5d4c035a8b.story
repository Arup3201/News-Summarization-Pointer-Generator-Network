After fighting with Comcast for months just to get her service fixed, Mary Bauer got a bill from the cable giant that let her know just how annoyed they were by her requests.

The Illinois woman saw the bill in her mail addressed to 'Super B---- Bauer.'

'I said, wait, I need to get my glasses on because I don't believe what I'm seeing,' she said. 'And there it was: Super B---- Bauer. So I've had it with Comcast.'

Illinois woman Mary Baeur got a bill from Comcast addressed to 'Super B---- Bauer' after fighting with the cable company to get the Hallmark Channel back in her package

While the issue was finally fixed, she didn't get a bill in November only for the late notice to show up with an extra $50 tagged on to the bottom line.

She says she's been battling with the company since last April, calling 'hundreds of times' as she tried to get them to restore the Hallmark Channel to her line-up. 

CNN Money reports that while the issue was finally fixed, she didn't get a bill in November only for the late notice to show up with an extra $50 tagged on to the bottom line.

The company told her her two-year contract had expired and that the channel was now included in a more expensive service.

She finally agreed to a higher rate to get it back. 

Bauer's story almost made it to air on a local station, but the broadcaster was owned by Comcast and the story was killed before it could come out. 

Another station agreed to air it and she got an apology from a Comcast manager just a minute before showtime.

'We are continuing to investigate this thoroughly, and have reached out to our customer to apologize and try to make it right,' the company wrote.

Small comfort for Bauer.

'Comcast is just the most disingenuous company on the entire planet,' she said. 'I've been totally frustrated with them for a very long time.'

Lisa Brown also had an insulting experience, saying the cable sent her a bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown'

The company, which has the worst customer service rating in the U.S. according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, is getting a reputation for insulting mailings. 

Cancelling cable is an unpleasant experience for most, but one couple were horrified when they then received the following month's bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown'.

Lisa and Ricardo Brown said they wanted to cancel the cable on their Comcast account - which cost them $60 - after suffering financial difficulties.

But Mrs Brown said the customer service representative transferred her to a retention specialist who attempted to persuade her to keep the cable and sign a new two-year contract.

When the couple, from Spokane, Washington, received their next bill, Mr Brown's name had been changed from Ricardo Brown to 'A**hole Brown.'

And shockingly, when Mrs Brown tried to get the profanity removed and name corrected, she faced difficulties. 

She contacted consumer advocacy writer, Christopher Elliott.

Mrs Brown, who has been a Comcast customer for two years, told him: 'I was never rude. It could have been that person was upset because I didn't take the offer.'

On his blog, Mr Elliot wrote: 'It’s no secret that employees sometimes feel their customers are jerks. 

'But I’ve never seen one put it in writing — until now.' 

Steve Kipp, Comcast's vice president of communications for the Washington region, apologized for the 'completely unacceptable' incident after being contacted by Mr Elliot.

In a statement, he said: 'We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change.

'We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. 

'We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.'

Mrs Brown was contacted by Rhonda Weaver, a Comcast senior director of government affairs, who promised to waive the $60 cancellation fee. 

Ms Weaver also said Comcast was investigating the name change and would terminate the employee who was responsible. 

But Mrs Brown felt this was insufficient, adding: 'This is unacceptable. I am requesting everything back I paid Comcast for doing this to me.'

Mr Elliot reported that Comcast has offered the Browns a full refund of the two years' worth of bills they have paid.
