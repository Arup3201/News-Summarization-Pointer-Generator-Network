Celtic captain Scott Brown has been pictured apparently drunk on a night out in Edinburgh just days ahead of this weekend’s League Cup final at Hampden.

Brown, 29, was with a group of friends in Edinburgh on Wednesday night after a day off from training as they toured the city’s lap-dancing bars. Witnesses describe him as being unsteady on his feet and photographs show £25,000-a-week Brown sitting on the pavement as he munches his way through some late-night fast food.

Celtic manager Ronny Deila has enforced a tough fitness regime since arriving at Parkhead in the summer and has banned chips and fizzy drinks from the players’ menu.

And Brown is likely to have some explaining to do when he arrives at training on Friday morning.

The Scottish Sun reports that Brown was in the Burke and Hare nightclub where he enjoyed the attention of scantily-clad girls and offered to buy dances for fellow drinkers.

But he was reported to have had an argument with some of the dancers and a barman had to intervene to calm the situation. 

Brown then left for the Western Bar where he was refused entry but was successful in getting into the nearby Baby Dolls lap-dancing bar.

The Sun reports that Brown was told by a bouncer to 'get some food and sober up' and he went on to fall asleep during a dance.

A source from Baby Dolls told the Sun: 'Brown and his pals weren’t in long. They had a couple of dances then left with no trouble, although they both clearly had a good drink in them.

'Scott was a bit wobbly on his feet.'

Celtic have so far refused to comment on the matter.

Brown was a £4.4million signing from Hibernian in 2007 – the largest fee between two Scottish clubs.

He was named captain by Gordon Strachan and has 42 Scotland caps.
