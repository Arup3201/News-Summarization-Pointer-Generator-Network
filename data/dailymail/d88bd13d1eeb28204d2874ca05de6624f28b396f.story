Robert Xie is accused of killing two children, their parents, and their aunt at their home in northwest Sydney in 2009

Accused murderer Robert Xie has 'a human face, but animal's heart', the Lin family matriarch says.

'I used to think he had higher education and could not be that bad. Now I see him as a monster.'

Feng Qin Zhu made the comments during another emotional day of evidence at the Supreme Court trial of her son-in-law Xie.

The crown says Xie was driven by bitterness when he crept into her son Min 'Norman' Lin's North Epping home in Sydney's northwest in the early hours of July 18, 2009.

Using a hammer-like weapon, Xie is alleged to have murdered his brother-in-law Mr Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, their young sons Henry and Terry, and Lily's sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Lin, 39.

Xie, who has pleaded not guilty, faced trial earlier this year but it was cut short.

He now is the midst of a retrial.

Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC asked Mrs Zhu what information she 'found out' between these two trials.

'It was about Robert. This person with a human face but animal's heart,' Mrs Zhu cried.

In the year before the killings, the crown alleges Xie had engaged in 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' toward a young female relative, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

After the murders, the 50-year-old allegedly began sexually abusing her regularly.

Mrs Zhu said she used to think Xie, who is married to her daughter Kathy Lin wasn't 'that bad' but after the sexual assault allegations were 'exposed' she now views him as a 'monster'.

Referring to a Chinese proverb, Mrs Zhu said her daughter Kathy was a 'fresh flower'.

'In contrast Robert was the ox s***,' she told the court on Thursday.

The trial continues.

Yang Fei Li, the patriarch of the family, told the court he was meant to take his grandson Henry shopping on the day of their deaths
