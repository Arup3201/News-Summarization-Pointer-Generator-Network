Masked gunmen have today killed nine trainee policemen after storming a house in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore.

It is the second attack on security forces in the relatively peaceful Punjab province in four days.

Police said at least half a dozen gunmen 
were involved in the attack on the housing compound.

Lahore city police chief Aslam Tareen 
said: 'At around 6 a.m., masked gunmen on three motorcycles stormed the 
house and opened fire.

'The victims were trainees at the Punjab Jail Academy.'

No group has claimed responsibility for today's attack, which also left three policemen wounded. But police suspect it was carried out by Islamist militants.

Many of the police officers were from the insurgency-hit northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province near the border with Afghanistan.Â 

On Monday, gunmen killed seven soldiers and a policeman at a riverside military encampment in eastern Pakistan, 60 miles north of Lahore.

The unrest happened in Gujrat where thousands of hardline Islamists 
spent the night on their way to the capital to protest over the 
government's recent decision to reopen the Nato supply line to 
Afghanistan.

Police chief Basharat Mahmood said it was unclear if any of the Islamist
protesters were involved in the incident but that it was 'surely a 
terrorist attack.'

The camp was attacked at around 5.20am local time, a little less than an
hour after the leaders of the Difah-e-Pakistan, or Defence of Pakistan,
protest movement finished delivering speeches inside the city.

The group, which includes hardline Islamist politicians and religious 
leaders, left the city of Lahore along with 8,000 supporters 
in 200 vehicles to make the 185-mile (300km) journey to Islamabad.

They travelled about halfway, spent the night in Gujrat and planned to 
hold a protest in front of parliament in the capital.

The roughly half a dozen gunmen who attacked the camp were riding in a 
car and on motorcycles.

The camp that was attacked was set up to look for the body of an army 
major who was flying a helicopter when it crashed into a river in the 
area, said police.

The leaders of Difah-e-Pakistan include people with known militant 
links, including Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba 
militant group, and Maulana Samiul Haq, known as the father of the 
Taliban.

But they are not known to be supporters of the Pakistani Taliban, who 
have waged a bloody insurgency against the state over the past few years
and killed thousands of soldiers and police.

The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility.

The group vowed more attacks in the province, raising the prospect of more violence in a region that has been largely spared by militant trouble in recent years.
