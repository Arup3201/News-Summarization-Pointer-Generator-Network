A Seattle woman has shamed a suspected groper by uploading photos of him to her Twitter account.

Julia Marquand, 28, took a handful of photos of known sex-offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in the city and supposedly touched her inappropriately.

After he tried to calmly walk away from the incident, Marquand followed him and took a collection of snaps on her cellphone.

In response, he tried to apologize in what she believes was 'damage control'.  

Allegations: Julia Marquand, 28, took a handful of photos of known sex-offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in the city and supposedly touched her inappropriately

Frustration: Marquand handed police the photos of Sharma, but they did not want to use them as evidence

She told Q13 Fox: 'I know the difference between being bumped into and being groped. I pulled out my phone and I just started snapping pictures.'

Marquand contacted the police who recognized him as being under Department of Corrections supervision.

However, officers would not take her images as evidence. But when she uploaded the photos, the response changed the course of the investigation. 

She told the TV station: ''I had no idea this would happen. I had 13 followers on Twitter when I started this.'

The Seattle Police Department acknowledged Marquand's frustration and  confirmed a detective was contacted by DOC officers after they recognized the man in photos the victim circulated on Twitter.

Sharma is said to have a history of groping and is a level 3 sex offender - meaning he is most likely to re-offend. 

Following Marquand's tweet, more people have come forward with allegations the same man has made advances at them.

In 2011, he was accused of groping a woman on a bench at Seattle's University Village. 

He was convicted twice in 2003 on assault charges related to rubbing himself against a woman and later grabbing another woman’s behind. 

After his actions were noticed on Twitter, Sharma was taken back into custody at the King County Jail on Wednesday for violating his probation.  

Serial offender: Sharma is said to have a history of groping and following Marquand's tweet, she claims 200 people have come forward with allegations the same man has groped them

A statement from Seattle PD read: 'SPD Sexual Assault detectives and Department of Corrections (DOC) officers have identified a person of interest in a weekend assault on a woman in downtown Seattle. 

'This person of interest is currently being held at the King County Jail for a violation of his DOC supervision.

'Police began investigating the incident after a woman contacted an officer at the West Precinct on October 12th to report a man groped the woman as she walked down the street near Westlake Park.

'The victim photographed the man before contacting police at the West Precinct.

'A West Precinct officer documented the incident, including a detailed description of the suspect, but did not collect the victim's photograph of the suspect at the time of the report.

'The victim, understandably frustrated by the incident, pro-actively circulated a photo of the man via social media, along with an account of her experience reporting the incident. 

'DOC officers contacted SPD detectives about the case after recognizing the man in the photo as a level III sex offender on DOC supervision.

'Police are still investigating the case, but are working to confirm a connection between the man identified by DOC officers and the Westlake incident.;
