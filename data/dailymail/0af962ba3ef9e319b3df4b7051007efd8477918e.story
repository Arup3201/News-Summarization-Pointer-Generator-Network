Skiers and snowboarders in Scotland were rewarded with heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures at the weekend, tempting thousands of snowsports fans to head for the hills - literally.

And with fresh snow on the way, Scottish resorts are expecting a rush of skiers hitting the slopes.

But while conditions were described as 'excellent' over the weekend, the rush to get to the Highlands caused chaos on the roads, with many motorists leaving their cars parked on the roadside.

As many resorts in Europe struggle with poor weather, dumploads of snow in Scotland created ideal skiing and snowboarding conditions at the weekend

Police were called to deal with gridlocked traffic on the A82 - the main road linking Fort William and Glasgow - after abandoned cars left the road impassable in places, while the icy conditions meant other roads were closed entirely.

An accident - which killed one pedestrian - left one of the main roads to the Scottish ski centre at Glenshee closed for most of Sunday, and another access road to the resort was impassable due to heavy snow and ice.

It was a similar situation at the Lecht ski centre,  prompting police to ask both resorts to evacuate and close early over fears for safety.

Temperatures in some parts of Scotland plunged to -15C tonight, making it the coldest night of the year so far.

The big chill is expected to last until Thursday, causing the Met Office to issue a yellow 'be aware' warning for snow and ice.

The warning covers the eastern coastline of the Highlands, including Caithness, Sutherland, Easter Ross, Inverness and Nairnshire.

However, there are 'fantastic conditions' waiting for those who did made it to a number of ski resorts north of the border.

Around 1,600 skiers and snowboarders are thought to have made it to Glencoe at the weekend, although numbers at Glenshee were slightly lower than expected due to the access problems.

Elsewhere, around 4,000 people made it to the Cairngorm ski area, with perfect conditions reported on Sunday, and it's thought that the Nevis Range, near Ben Nevis, welcomed more than 3,000 visitors.

Enthusiastic skiers and boarders took to Twitter to express their delight at the premium conditions. Guy Daynes ‏@GuyDaynes, wrote: 'No wind, blues skies, snow and sub-zero temperatures. Just what the Dr ordered after last weeks gales. #Glencoe', while Ed Smith (‏@EdSmith) claimed it was the 'best conditions you could ask for!'

The dumpload of snow at the weekend also coincided with World Snow Day - a Féderation Internationale du Ski initiative to encourage people onto the slopes. 

Scotland's ski usually suffer unsettled weather in January, this weekend's snowfall was an unexpected boost to the country's wintersports industry, which is worth around £30million annually to the economy. 

Chair of Ski Scotland Heather Negus said: 'As World Snow Day timing is never ideal for Scotland, we are also planning our own celebratory Ski Scotland Snowfest in March, when the Scottish mountains weather is more likely to play ball.'
