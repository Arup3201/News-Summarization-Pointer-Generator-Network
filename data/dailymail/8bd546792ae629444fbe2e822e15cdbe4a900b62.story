A property tycoon, once estimated to be worth more than £400m, has been ordered to disclose his true assets or go to jail after claiming he is too poor to pay his wife’s divorce settlement.

Scot Young, who made a fortune as a fixer for British businessmen and Russian Oligarchs, has been accused by wife Michele, 48, of hiding ‘enormous assets’ to get out of paying the £30,000 a month she had been awarded.

Mr Young, 51, who once owned a dazzling portfolio of properties, claims he has been left penniless after a large Moscow real estate deal collapsed.

Acrimonious: Former property Tycoon Scot Young, 51, has been accused of hiding his true wealth by his estranged wife Michelle, 48,  during their bitter and long-running divorce settlement

But at a High Court hearing this week, he was ordered to make a full financial disclosure or serve the six month sentence originally handed to him in 2009 which was then suspended.

He has been ordered to produce tax returns and complete a detailed questionnaire on his finances and told to return to court mid January when he could face jail.

The bitter divorce hearing, one of the biggest in British legal history, has been rumbling on since 2006.

The couple once owned some of the finest homes in England, fabulous cars and a yacht in Monaco. They travelled the world by private jet and were waited on by a battalion of servants.

New love: Mr Young has since fallen for 29-year-old model Noelle Reno, who he has reportedly promised to marry once he gets through the acrimonious divorce battle

Once, Mr Young bought his wife a Range 
Rover filled with tens of thousands of pounds worth of couture dresses 
by designer Maria Grachvogel.

For her 40th birthday, he lavished her 
with £1 million worth of Graff diamond jewellery. But the couple, who have two daughters, separated in 2006 after 11 years of marriage.

He
has now fallen for 29-year-old model Noelle Reno, who he has reportedly
promised to marry once he gets through the acrimonious divorce battle.

At a previous session, a judge accused Mr Young of repeatedly failing to produce evidence of his true finances.     

The case has been delayed after Michelle, a former model, struggled to find the money to pay her legal team and to fund a forensic analysis of her husband’s accounts.

In July she was involved in a separate High Court case with  some of her solicitors over a no win - no claim arrangement said to be worth around £3.5m. She is already believed to have spent over £1m in the settlement.

This week she successfully got an earlier ruling overturned after arguing the case had come to an effective standstill due to a lack of money as well as the illness of a judge as well as her husband’s health problems.

A trial, expected to last for a month, had been scheduled to start this week but has now been delayed until October next year.

Mr Young told the court his wife has been represented by ten different law firms over the years, but she claims this is an exaggeration.

His passport was confiscated at a previous hearing and he has been told he will not get it back until after the January hearing.

Mr Young had said he wanted to travel to Africa to do charity work, but Mr Justice Mostyn said this was ‘implausible’.

According to the Times Newspaper he told an earlier hearing: ‘I want to get back to work and to provide for my family. I have two daughters I love.

'I am working to get my life back in shape. I need the opportunity to travel. I want to get my life back in shape.’
