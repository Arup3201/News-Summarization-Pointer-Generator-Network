Police investigating the murder of a man found naked on a beach have discovered a woolly hat and a rucksack which may have belonged to him.

The unidentified, bearded man, who appears to have suffered ‘numerous’ injuries, was found lying in surf wearing just a pair of socks and a shoe.

But the bag and black and white headgear, which washed up near the corpse at Perranporth Beach in North Cornwall, may provide an insight into his mysterious death.

Discovery: Devon and Cornwall Police found the hat on the same day as the body, but now believe it may have belonged to the unidentified victim

Bag: Officers investigating the murder also found a black rucksack at the scene

Other clues discovered by police include a set of keys and a faded black and white photo of a boy, which is said to have been taken in 1952. 

Officers hope anyone who recognises the image can help them with their inquiries.

Almost
 a week after the body was found, his identity is still a mystery, 
leading police appeal to anyone who might recognise any of the 
items.

The
 body was found by a member of the public on Tuesday afternoon. The 
white man is thought to be aged between 50 and 70, with white receding 
hair with a bald patch and a thick white beard.

A day later, a navy blue Regatta coat was found nearby containing a wallet and a faded picture of a child. 

A
 date on the back of the picture reads April 13, 1952, but it is unclear
 what this refers to or if the jacket and wallet even belonged to the 
dead man. His injuries are understood not to be consistent with 
drowning, and it is believed the man had something wedged in his throat.

It was initially thought the man may have killed himself but Devon and Cornwall Police say he had multiple suspicious injuries.

Mystery: A faded photo of a toddler that dates back to 1952 was found in a wallet lying near the body

Police attend the scene where a man's body was washed up on the beach at Perranporth, Cornwall. He was found dead on a beach naked with just one shoe and an old black and white photograph. The death is being treated as suspicious

Resident
 Joan Taylor, 72, said of the investigation: ‘Everyone is talking about 
it. It’s a small place and to find a murder victim on the beach and have
 police buzzing around is not an everyday thing.’

Yesterday police confirmed that the investigation had changed direction.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Dave Thorne, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ‘We 
are now treating the discovery of the body as suspicious.

'The change in 
tack has come about as a result of the post-mortem. There are injuries 
on his body that we are not able to explain, and as a result of that we 
are treating the death as suspicious.’

He
 added: ‘We are not happy that they were caused by natural means or 
through rock or sand abrasions. We can’t really avoid the fact there may
 be a third party involved. They are external injuries over various 
parts of his body.

The bearded victim was discovered by a member of the public on Tuesday on the popular beach. A dark navy-blue Regatta jacket was found near to the unidentified man

The set of keys found near the body

The man was was reportedly completely naked apart from socks and one walking shoe. A day later a dark navy blue Regatta coat was found nearby

Police are working with coastguards and other experts to find out where the body may have entered the water

‘Finding 
out the identity of this man is key to the investigation. Without 
knowing who he is, it is very difficult to find out what happened to him
 and establish the circumstances surrounding his death.

‘We think he was in the water for between 12 and 24 hours.’

A police spokesman said the man’s fingerprints had been sent to Interpol.

The set of keys consists of a Citroen car key, two mortice lock keys, a hippopotamus key-ring and a red fob.
