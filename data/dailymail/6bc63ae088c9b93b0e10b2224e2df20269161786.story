The office of a German newspaper that printed Charlie Hebdo cartoons was the target of an arson attack early this morning.

Vandals threw rocks at the headquarters of the Hamburg Morgenpost (MOPO), which reprinted cartoons from the satirical magazine at the centre of the terrorist attacks in Paris last week.

Two men who were 'behaving suspiciously' in the area have been arrested by police and German state security have begun an investigation.
