Lord Jeffrey Archer has called on Prime Minister David Cameron to be doused in freezing water - after taking part in his own Ice Bucket Challenge.

The shivering politician turned author became the latest celebrity to nominate the PM after wife Dame Mary nominated him for the challenge on Saturday.

In the footage the best-selling author can be seen grimacing as he prepares for his wife to douse him with ice cold water.

The writer had freezing water tipped over him by his wife Lady Mary, who appears to enjoy the dousing

Lord Archer said: 'It is very clever and it's astonishing the number of people who have gotten involved for such a good cause'

Grimace: Lord Archer does not look happy about the challenge, which has raised millions for charity

He then says: 'I am doing the Ice Bucket Challenge for motor neurone disease and I nominate Sajid Javid (Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport), an old friend, Ian Botham, the great unknown cricketer, and the Prime Minister, David Cameron.'

Lady Mary only pours a tiny bucket of water on to her husband, but as Lord Archer goes to leave the chair she says 'not so fast' and throws a full bucket of iced water over his head.

The writer, who was jailed for four years for perjury after lying to a court about his dealings with prostitute Monica Coghlan, sits opened mouthed before saying 'excuse me', walking back into his home and telling the cameraman to 'get lost'.

Lord Archer also nominated Sajid Javid MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and legendary cricketer Ian Botham.

Lord Archer, who has just released his new book Be Careful What You Wish For, said: 'In my lifetime I have raised more than £100million but haven't done anything quite like this before.

'It is very clever and it's astonishing the number of people who have gotten involved for such a good cause.'

Lady Mary said: 'It is really quite a shock for a man in his 70s but he is a real trouper and it is for a good cause.

'It is extraordinary how this challenge has taken off.'

After being nominated by Scottish first minister Alex Salmond and glamour model Katie Price it seems the pressure is mounting on the Tory leader.
