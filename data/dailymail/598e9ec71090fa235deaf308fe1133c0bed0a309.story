Large parts of Brisbane city are in lockdown and world leaders have begun arriving in the Queensland capital ahead of this weekend's G20 summit.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and South Africa's President Jacob Zuma are among the first world leaders to arrive in the country for the talk-fest.

But behind all the handshakes, motorcades and stepped-up security measures, what is the G20 all about?

The Lowy Institiute's director of G20 Studies, Mike Callaghan, says it's the most important economic meeting ever had in Australia.

'It is a meeting of the leaders from the largest economies in the world,' Mr Callaghan said.

'It focuses on what each country should do to try and improve their growth and create more jobs, on the basis that if everyone moves together you'll get a better outcome.' 

But Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is expected to come under pressure to address other issues such as climate change, following major commitments from the US and China to slash emissions, and Ebola, with British Prime Minister David Cameron to press for a more committed response to combating the disease.

ECONOMIC GROWTH

The main game for this weekend's summit is to boost global economic growth.

In February, the G20 finance ministers came together and agreed that each country would make a plan to boost global growth by 2 percent by 2018.

Since then, each country has been coming up with an individual action plan to contribute to realising this goal, which they will present to other leaders at the summit.

AVOIDING ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS

Monash University political science expert Zareh Ghazarian says the target of this year's G20 is to strengthen the global economy so countries will be more insulated should another financial crisis hit.

'They'll be talking about infrastructure, bridge building and road building,' Dr Ghazarian said.

'Really traditional economics, because those are the things that employ people and when people are employed you have a stronger economy.'

Dr Ghazarian said the Brisbane summit would be a very 'nuts and bolts' type of summit.

'It will look at the workings of economies and how to strengthen them,' he said.

'We're not going to see grand plans, I don't think there will be the "Brisbane Agreement" or anything.'

TAX DODGING

Also on the agenda will be tax avoidance by multinational corporations.

'There's the OECD/G20 action plan, looking at trying to plug the loopholes in the laws so that companies can't use devices to shift profits to lower or no tax jurisdictions,' Mr Callaghan said.

'TOO BIG TO FAIL' BANKS

Mr Callaghan said the long-running issue of financial regulation will also be on the table. 

'One of the big things that they will be trying to come up with is an agreement trying to stop the "too big to fail" banks from needing governments to put money into them,' he said.

'These big banks have to have more of their own capital so if they get into problems they won't have to rely on the taxpayer bailing them out.'

HISTORY OF THE G20

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is determined to keep the focus on economics, despite pressure to address issues like climate change and Ebola.

Historically, the G20 has always had a fiscal focus.

It started in 1997 as an annual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in response to the Asian financial crisis.

But in November 2008, following the global financial crisis, there was recognition that economic issues had the potential to drag the entire world down so it was agreed that world leaders should also attend.

EBOLA, ISIS AND CLIMATE CHANGE

Mr Callaghan says so-called side issues - like climate change, ISIS and the fallout from MH17 - still have an economic impact and will likely be addressed.

'The rising tensions like what's happening the Ukraine, or in Syria and Iraq, they do impact on the world economy,' he said.

'The International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for global growth next year because of these rising geopolitical tensions.

'The G20 isn't the UN and it doesn't come up with or negotiate big peace settlements or emissions targets.

'But leaders can have a frank discussion about those issues and provide some political leadership and momentum towards dealing with then.'

AWKWARD FOR ABBOTT  

There will be a main meeting – otherwise known as a plenary session – attended by all leaders where they will follow a fixed agenda.

In addition, world leaders will hold one-on-one or bilateral meetings.

'I don't think security issues will come up in the main meeting but in side meetings they will come up.'

'It's a bit like speed dating, they'll line them up and Abbott will meet a whole lot of [other leaders] as the chair of the summit,' Mr Callaghan said.

Mr Abbott has called for an apology from Russian President Vladimir Putin over the loss of 298 lives, including 38 Australians, when the MH17 plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July.

But there are other non-economic issues he has made it clear he does not want to discuss, such as climate change.

So far, the Australian G20 presidency has resisted making climate change a top agenda item, but it will likely be discussed after this week's historic carbon emissions reduction deal between the US and China.

Earlier this week the two major polluters announced an ambitious agreement to slash their greenhouse gas output by 2030.

British Prime Minister David Cameron has also indicated that he will press world leaders including Mr Abbott to do more to combat Ebola, which has so far killed more than 5000 people in West Africa.
