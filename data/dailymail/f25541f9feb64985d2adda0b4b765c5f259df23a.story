The biggest road-building programme for almost half a century is unveiled by ministers today.

Ministers will announce a £15billion masterplan to build or upgrade 1,300 miles of roads. 

The move is an echo of the ‘roads for prosperity’ scheme unveiled by Margaret Thatcher in 1989 to boost ‘the great car economy.’

Details of exactly where the new roads will be built and when are yet to be finalised, but the 100 separate schemes include:

The package unveiled today by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin includes £1.5billion to add extra lanes to key motorways. New charging points every 20 miles on most routes will promote the use of greener electric vehicles.

‘This is the biggest investment in our road network since the 1970s,’ said Mr Alexander, who chairs the Cabinet’s infrastructure committee. ‘My view is previous governments over the last four decades have systematically underinvested in our roads, railways, telecoms and energy.

‘That’s something that has really weakened our economic growth and has held Britain back.

‘We have to make very difficult choices in other areas of public spending in order to unlock this big investment. We’ve made the Treasury a department for infrastructure.’

The plans include making the A1 a dual carriageway almost all the way to the Scottish border

He insisted reforms to the Highways Agency will make it impossible for a future government to trim the programme to save cash.

‘The Highways Agency is becoming more autonomous, like Network Rail. It will be given a brief every five years and will go away and deliver it. So future governments simply can’t decide to turn this all upside down again,’ the Chief Secretary said.

The Department of Transport said: ‘Over 1,300 new lane miles will be added by schemes being delivered over the next parliament on motorways and trunk roads, tackling congestion and fixing some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the network.

‘With 90 per cent of journeys taking place on our roads, this work is vital to help people get on and get around.’

Spending during the next parliament on England’s roads network will be boosted further by maintenance funding worth more than £10billion across the road network.

One of the flagship projects is a £2billion commitment to have dual carriageways for the entire A303 and A358 to the South West, including a twin-bore 1.8mile tunnel at the notorious Stonehenge bottleneck. This will allow road users to drive on a dual carriageway from London to within 15 miles of Land’s End.

There will be improvements to a third of the junctions on the M25 ‘to aid frustrated commuters stuck in traffic around the capital’.

In the North East, the Government is setting aside £290million to complete the dualling of the A1 from London to Ellingham, just 25 miles from the Scottish border ‘to make the Great North Road truly great again’.

Across the North West and Yorkshire the Government aims to complete a ‘smart’ motorway along the entire length of the M62 from Manchester to Leeds along with improvements to transpennine capacity from Manchester to Sheffield.

There will be a commitment to improve links to the Port of Liverpool as one of 12 projects designed to improve access to trading gateways.

In the South East there will be funding for £350million of improvements to the A27 along the south coast to tackle severe congestion at Arundel, Worthing and Lewes.

Some £300million has been earmarked to upgrade the east-west connection to Norfolk with new dual carriageway sections of the A47 and improved links to the A1 and A11.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘All road users are entitled to safe and uncongested national arteries. We can no longer ignore the inadequate resources going into the mainstay of the UK transport system – our roads – which carry 86 per cent of passenger journeys and more than 90 per cent of freight.

‘We spend less than a quarter of motoring taxes on this critical national asset whilst many key competitor countries spend much more.

‘At long last the Government has recognised that we need a long term coherent plan for our roads, with guaranteed funding, to end the stop-start mess experienced over the last few decades.’

The Midlands will see improvements to the M42 to the east of Birmingham to improve connections, including to Birmingham airport.
