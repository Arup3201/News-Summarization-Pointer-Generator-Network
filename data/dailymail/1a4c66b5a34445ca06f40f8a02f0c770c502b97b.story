Paul Scholes has likened Ross Barkley to the Wayne Rooney of 2004 and has urged Roy Hodgson to unleash his young Lions on Italy.

It was at the European Championships in Portugal 10 years ago that a teenage Rooney exploded on to the international scene, scoring four times during the group stage before succumbing to injury in the quarter-final exit to the hosts.

And Scholes believes Barkley - who missed the team coach ahead of the first training session in Brazil but has impressed in the warm-up matches - should start when England open their World Cup campaign against the Italians in Manaus on Saturday.

Speaking his mind: Paul Scholes has discussed England's forthcoming game against Italy in his latest blog

On the ball: Ross Barkley, in training for England on Wednesday, could be the next Rooney, according to Scholes

‘None of the big teams fear England in this World Cup. Let’s give them something to worry about. Ross Barkley must start,’ said the former Manchester United star in his latest column for Paddy Power.

‘I was watching the England versus Ecuador friendly in an airport lounge, a bit back from the screen. In the first-half Barkley went on a run and I thought, “Bloody hell, is that Rooney?”.

‘Barkley made me think of Wayne at Euro 2004. I had to take a second look because I thought it was Wayne. Barkley has no fear.’

Scholes, 
however, fears that England could stumble through their group before 
exiting the tournament in customary fashion via a penalty shootout.

And that is why he insists a shift towards youth is what Hodgson needs.

‘This
 could be just me, but how do England play football? I don’t know. It 
seems there’s speculation before every game about how we are going to 
approach the match tactically,’ he went on.

‘Two up front? One up front? Wide players? Holding midfielders?

‘The strength of the England squad is this new breed of players who are enthusiastic, athletic and attack-minded.

‘There
 is no point taking people like Raheem Sterling or Barkley to Brazil 
“for the experience”. Play them.

'Some might say it’s risky. But these 
players have the fitness and ability to get the ball back if they lose 
it - hopefully not in dangerous positions.  You want them to attack and 
give the opposition problems.

‘Now is a great chance for Roy Hodgson to give English football the identity we’ve lacked.

‘Do
 we want to go to a major tournament, get a couple of nil-all draws, a 
one-nil and then we might scrape through the group before we go out on 
penalties in the last 16 or quarter finals? There’s no future for 
England in this approach.

‘Hodgson
 has little to lose by going for the jugular in Rio. Will we be 
satisfied if England scrape through to the quarter-finals playing 
negative football?

'Let’s not do that and instead take responsibility for
 what happens if we go for it. Let these England players off the leash.'
