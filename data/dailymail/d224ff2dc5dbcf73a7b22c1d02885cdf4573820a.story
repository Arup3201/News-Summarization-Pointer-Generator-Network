Isabel Ramsay, executive headteacher of Bandon Hill Primary School is paid more than the Prime Minister

A primary school head teacher is being paid more than £200,000 a year - taking her income above that of the Prime Minister. 

Isabel Ramsay is paid more than her boss, the chief executive of Sutton Council and is one of the highest paid headteachers in Britain.

Her school, Bandon Hill Primary, said she is paid so much because she is executive head teacher and does work throughout London with other schools. 

But union workers have said they do not believe Mrs Ramsay should be paid so much more than other teachers and she should be focusing on her school rather than working at others.

Mrs Ramsay's income was revealed after Sutton council published its core financial statement this year. This revealed she is paid £190,898 in salary, fees and allowances with a further £14,178 in employer's pension contribution, bringing the total to £205,076.

The Prime Minister is paid £142,500 and Mrs Ramsey's boss, Niall Bolger received a basic salary of £163,635, with a pension top up of £28,473 bringing his total to £192.108.

Mrs Ramsey's salary is determined by the governors at the school, not Sutton Council or the Department of Education. 

When Sutton Council asked the school to explain Mrs Ramsey's high income they said it covered her work at Bandon Hill as well as that supporting other schools across the country. 

Bandon Hill Primary School, in Wallington, south west London, is made up of two primary schools and Oak Field, a specialist autistic unit. Each of the three schools have their own headteacher. 

Nancy Bonney, 82, is the assistant secretary for NUT Sutton. She said: 'Every teacher I have ever met works extremely hard and their best for the children.

'I don't think a head teacher should work at more than one school. Even if you have the best deputy, it is not the same.

Governors at Bandon Hill said Mrs Ramsay's salary is due to the work she does with schools across the UK

Mrs Ramsay's pay was revealed in Sutton Council's core financial statements, showing that with her salary and employer pension contributions she earns more than the chief executive of Sutton Council, her boss.

'She must be run off her feet even if she is very well organised.

'I don't know about head teachers being paid so much more than their staff and I don't think one head should be running more than one school.'

Mrs Ramsay's salary increased from £172,218 last year, making her one of the highest paid headteachers in the country.

A spokesman for the school governors said her pay reflected the fact she was running a 'very large primary school'. 

He added: 'In addition the Executive Headteacher and other staff from Bandon Hill are currently supporting three other schools, one of which is in London, one in the South East and one in the East of England. As a national leader of education, and as a national support school, the Executive Headteacher and the staff provide a range of interventions, including working directly with other headteachers, to support those schools in accelerating pupil progress and in raising standards of attainment.

Mrs Ramsay is one of the highest paid headteachers

In 2010 it was revealed that Mark Elms, 57, of Tidemill Primary School in Lewisham, south-east London, received £248,100. 

His salary which was due in part to his work on the London Challenge programme, was described as 'extraordinary' and 'exorbitant'at the time. 

And in May of this year Sir Greg Martin, executive head of Durand Academy in south London, saw his salary and pension increase to a total of £229,138. 

He was knighted in last year's birthday honours. 

Ric Adams, chairman of Bandon Hill Primary School's governors, said: 'The salary level of all staff in Bandon Hill, including the executive head teacher, is determined by the school's governing body.

'The salary figure currently being attributed to the executive head teacher is not an accurate reflection of the actual salary paid by Bandon Hill Primary School.

'Bandon Hill is a designated national support school and the executive head teacher is a national leader of education.

'Therefore the remuneration level quoted includes both pension contributions as per requirements and also reflects the work which the executive head teacher and the school do in supporting a number of other schools in several local authorities across the country.'

A spokesman for Sutton Council said neither they or the Department of Education had been approached by the school's governors about Mrs Ramsey's level of remuneration..

He said: 'The level of pay for school staff is decided by school's governors and not the responsibility of the council.

'We are aware of the salary figure for the head teacher which is much higher than usual.

In 2010 it was revealed that Tidemill Primary School headteacher Mark Elms (left) was earning a salary of £248,100 and earlier this year that Sir Greg Martin (right) was receiving an income of £229,138

'We asked the governing body to explain the package and have been told it covers school salary plus remuneration for work done at schools in other local authorities.'

Mrs Ramsay has been at the school for more than 20 years according to her LinkedIn profile. 

In its last Ofsted inspection in 2008 the then Bandon Hill Primary School achieved an outstanding rating.
