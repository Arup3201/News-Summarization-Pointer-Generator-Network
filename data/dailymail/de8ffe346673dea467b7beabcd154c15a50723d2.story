Rickie Fowler's much-discussed Ryder Cup haircut has been copied by one of the American game's most senior officials.

Fowler, one of the United States team's most in-form players, arrived in Scotland for this week's match at Gleneagles with 'USA' shaved into his hair.

US captain Tom Watson described the cut as 'terrific' and suggested even Ted Bishop, the president of the PGA of America, would have it done if it meant his team would win.

Bishop has now taken up Watson on his challenge, with footage of the administrator being shorn posted on the United States team's Twitter feed.

A tweet read: 'Tom said @tedbishop38pga should shave USA in his hair if it would help us win. Then there was really only one option.'

Bishop then gave an update, tweeting a picture of himself and Fowler stood back-to-back and a message which read: 'It's done. The Fowler USA cut! I believe we will win.'

Yet if 25-year-old Fowler, who had long hair in his younger days, intended for his dramatic new look to be intimidating, he may not be succeeding.

Rickie Fowler is well known for his outlandish personality - the American always wears the orange of his alma mater Oklahoma State University on the final day of tournaments

Despite being the second youngest member of the US team Rickie Fowler is expected to be a key player at Gleneagles 

Europe's Lee Westwood, a veteran of eight previous Ryder Cup contests, certainly appears not to be fazed.

'I've seen it. I've touched it. I gave it a stroke yesterday on the range!' Westwood joked in his pre-event press conference.

Asked if he would adopt something similar, the 41-year-old added: 'I know I've got a big head, but I don't know if it's big enough to fit 'Europe' on it.

But Lee Westwood was not fazed by Rickie Fowler's daring trim 

The Ryder Cup veteran is raring to go as he prepares for a ninth Ryder Cup cap 

'I find it quite amusing. It's the sort of thing that a 25-year-old lad that's right behind his team does, I suppose.

'That's the kind of character he is and fair play to him. Suits him, I think. Looks good.'
