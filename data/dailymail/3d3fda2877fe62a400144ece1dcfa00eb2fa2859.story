Earlier this week astronomers made the groundbreaking announcement that they had found eight new habitable planets using the Kepler space telescope - bringing its total up to 1,000.

But will we ever have a chance to glimpse these planets in greater detail, either by telescope or perhaps by visiting them in the future?

According to one of Nasa's top planet hunters, we will find a planet with oceans like Earth in the next 15 years - but visiting one would require us to overcome Einstein's law of special relativity. 

Dr Mather from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland explained how the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope could find planets with oceans on them (illustrated).

Dr John Mather is an astrophysicist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and the senior project scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

The giant telescope will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe, figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed.

But perhaps most excitingly, it will study Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system.

‘We hope to find a planet that’s Earth-like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean,’ he said in an interview with All About Space Magazine.

‘I think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now.

‘In that time we might be able to say: “I can see that star over there. [Its planet] has a climate that’s like Earth and it might have life on it.”’

While observing distant worlds is all well and good, actually visiting one at some point in the future poses somewhat of a challenge.

And it’s something that Dr Mather thinks might be too much for us even with the help of artificial intelligence.

To have any hope, one thing that will be important will be ‘defeating Einstein’ - namely, finding a way to overcome the limitations of light speed and space-time - or enlisting the help of robots.

According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, nothing can travel faster than light - making interstellar travel all but impossible for humans.

‘We’re very fragile,’ said Dr Mather.

‘We’re not going to be able to travel in person very far without a lot of help.

‘I think robots are coming along very quickly. I believe robotic intelligence will come and we’ll have to decide whether we like them or not.

‘If they’re smart enough, then they can tell us what to do and where to go just as they did in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.

‘However, I think it’s also possible that we’re going to defeat Einstein and that it will still be too far for us to go to another solar system.

‘It’s not impossible but it’s pretty hard. That’s what I think.’

Dr Mather (right) also said that in ten to 15 years 'we hope to find a planet that’s Earth-like and measure its atmosphere' to see if it has oceans on it

The JWST is the successor to Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope and will launch in 2018. It is the size of a tennis court and will be launched in a compact form before unfolding in space. Shown here is a full-scale mock-up of what it will look like when it unfolds

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter (21ft) primary mirror.

It is named after astronomer James Webb, who was the effective administrator for Nasa from 1961 through to 1968. He is widely heralded with persuading President Kennedy to fund the Apollo missions to the moon.

The project is working to a 2018 launch date. It is a collaboration between Nasa, Esa and the Canadian space agency.

The JWST will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

It will study every phase in the history of our universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own solar system. 

But while travel to one of these distant worlds might be somewhat of an impossibility for now, Dr Mather is optimistic when it comes to the chances of finding life elsewhere.

‘How life came to evolve on our planet is strong evidence that life can evolve elsewhere in the universe,’ he said.

‘Intelligent life - that’s us - has only really turned up quite recently. We ourselves are made out of star material.

‘Stars that explode send chemical material into space. Some of it is recycled and some of it travels outside of our galaxy to make the next generation of stars that could have planets - worlds that could be like Earth.

‘So that’s the idea: stars explode and make future generations of stars and planets.’

Finding out if we are not alone in the universe - or at least detecting tantalising hints that we are not - will be one of the primary goals of the JWST.

It will also be used to scour the universe, just like the Hubble Space Telescope, and with the ability to take images in visible light it will no doubt return fascinating vistas back to Earth.

Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped mirror segments on the JWST (shown) is 4.3ft (1.32m) in diameter. The giant telescope will be the powerful space telescope ever launched. It will be in an orbit about 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometres) from Earth to get the best views of the universe

Earlier this week astronomers revealed eight new planets had been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist.

The discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of Earth which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars.

Among these eight, astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. 

The two most Earth-like planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. They have a 70 per cent and 60 per cent chance of being rocky, respectively. 

Its design, though, is radically different from that of Hubble. The JWST ‘doesn’t look like a standard telescope in a tube,’ Dr Mather explained.

Instead, it will be a vast array of 18 hexagonal gold mirrors stitched together, which unfold after launch, to afford it our best ever view of the universe.

Together with its vast sunshield, which prevents light from the sun ruining its optics, it is about the size of a tennis court.

Thousands of astronomers will use data from the telescope after it launches in 2018 atop an Ariane V rocket.

'We’re doing this for the whole of humanity and 10,000 future users of the telescope,' explained Dr Mather. 

And many of those will be waiting with bated breath to find out if it can reveal fascinating new insights about potentially Earth-like worlds in other planetary systems.
