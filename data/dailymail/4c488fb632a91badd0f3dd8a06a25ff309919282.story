A Sudanese woman sentenced to death for marrying a Christian was forced to give birth with her legs chained, it has been revealed today.

Meriam Ibrahim was shackled as her baby daughter was born in jail in Sudan where she is awaiting execution for marrying a Christian U.S. citizen.

Amid the joy of seeing his child for
 the first time, her husband Daniel Wani has spoken of his anger at the treatment she received during labour.

Proud: Father Daniel Wani, a U.S. citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire, holds Maya for the first time after being allowed to visit to his wife, Meriam Ibrahim, who was sentenced to death for marrying him, a Christian

Cruel:

his father has been granted U.S. citizenship. He is being held with Meriam because the authorities claim he is a Muslim and will not release him into the care of a Christian

Mr Wani told The Telegraph: 'They kept a chain on her legs. She is very unhappy about that.'

He said that he had initially been refused permission to see his daughter, but authorities eventually let him in to the prison - and his wife was momentarily freed from her chains.

Mr Daniel Wani was then able to hold his daughter Maya for
 the first time after she was born five days early in the hospital wing at Omdurman Federal Women’s Prison in North Khartoum yesterday.

Meriam has spent the past four months shackled to the floor in a disease-ridden jail after being sentenced to death by hanging earlier this month for converting from Islam to Christianity and marrying a Christian man.

Her lawyer Mohaned Mustafa Elnour said the couple are 'happy and proud' of their new arrival and that it has brought a momentary ray of light to an otherwise bleak and desperate situation.

Mr Elnour: 'This is a special moment for them. Daniel is delighted that he is able to see his new daughter so soon.

'The family are taking some time to enjoy the birth before they return to fighting the injustice of Meriam's sentence.'

Daniel, a 27-year-old biochemist who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, also got the chance to hold his 20-month-old son Martin, who is being held in the barbaric prison with his mother.

The photo is especially poignant as Meriam will never see her beautiful daughter grow up. She is set to hang sometime in the next two years as the authorities said she will be executed when she has finished weaning Maya.

And before the birth, Meriam made the defiant claim that she would rather die than give up her faith.

In a heart-wrenching conversation with her husband during a rare prison visit, Meriam told him: 'If they want to execute me then they should go ahead and do it because I’m not going to change my faith.’

Loving: Meriam and Daniel married in Sudan. Daniel left New Hampshire to visit her in Sudan and arrange for his wife and son to join him in America when she was arrested

An
 Islamic Sharia judge said she could be spared the death penalty if she 
publicly renounced her faith and becomes a Muslim once more.

Meriam
 insists she has always been a Christian and told her husband she could 
not 'pretend to be a Muslim' just to spare her life.

She told him: 'I refuse to change. I am not giving up Christianity just so that I can live.

'I know I could stay alive by becoming a Muslim and I would be able to look after our family, but I need to be true to myself.’

Daniel revealed his wife’s defiant stance during an 
exclusive interview with MailOnline at his modest home in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.

Sitting
 beneath glamorous photographs of his wife taken at their wedding in 
December 2011, he said: 'My wife is very, very strong. She is stronger 
than me.

'When they 
sentenced her to death I broke down and tears were streaming down my 
eyes. Our lawyers were passing me tissues. But she stayed strong.

'She
 did not flinch when she was sentenced. It was amazing to see, 
particularly because she is the one facing the death penalty.’

Daniel
 was in Khartoum trying to arrange for Meriam and their 20-month-old son,
 Martin, to live with him in the US when his wife was arrested in 
September. She was three weeks pregnant with their second child.

The authorities will not release Martin into the care of his father because they claim he is a Muslim too.

Bleak: The Omdurman Women's Jail in Khartoum, Sudan where Meriam Ibrahim is being held. It is overcrowded and riven with disease

She
 spends much of her time shackled to the floor, is not receiving much nutrition in her food and is rarely allowed outside.

Both she and her bewildered son have contracted various illnesses because of the poor sanitation at the jail.

A
 report by Human Rights Watch claims the prison is 'beset with 
overcrowding’ and suffers from 'poor sanitation, disease and the deaths 
of many children living with their mothers’.

Daniel, who is originally from South Sudan, but is now a naturalized American, was initially refused permission to visit her.

Daniel told MailOnline: 'They say the
 marriage is void. Now, even my wife is no longer my wife. And my son is
 not mine and my new daughter is not mine. They say I am a stranger to 
them.

'I know my wife puts 
on a brave face but I can tell that she is in quite a bit of pain. She 
doesn’t get to leave the room for weeks.

'She
 has suffered medical complications while in jail, but no one knows the 
full extent of what they are because she is in prison. It’s a difficult 
time. To see her walking in chains is difficult.’

Daniel,
 who is wheelchair-bound because he suffers from muscular dystrophy, 
cuts a forlorn figure as he wheels himself around his empty house.

His
 child’s bed lies unused, as does a child-sized toothbrush. Daniel keeps
 himself busy by studying the regular barrage of paperwork that his 
legal team send him.

Like many in Sudan, both Daniel and his wife’s childhood were blighted by civil war.

Daniel managed to escape the brutal conflict in 1998 when he travelled to America with his brother Gabriel.

The
 biochemist returned to Sudan to marry Meriam at a Christian service in a
 chapel which was attended by around 500 people in December 2011.

Most who were at the wedding ceremony could vouch for the pair being committed Christians, defence lawyers say.

But witnesses who were willing to give evidence on her behalf were barred from testifying because they were Christian.

She even produced a marriage certificate identifying herself as a Christian.

Despite
 this, the judge determined that because her father was a Muslim, even 
though he abandoned the family while they were living in a refugee camp 
in the South East of Sudan when she was six, she too was a Muslim who 
had broken the law by leaving Islam.

But
 her mother, who is now dead, brought her up as Christian. Her mother 
was born in Ethiopia to Christian parents, but fled to Sudan because of 
famine, and chose to raise her daughter in the same religion.

Meriam was arrested in mid-September, three weeks after her second child was conceived.

At
 first the couple dismissed the allegations against them as trivial, but
 when the case grew more serious Daniel went to the American Embassy in 
Khartoum for help.

'I 
thought this would be the one place which would help me, but they told 
me they didn’t have time to do anything,’ Daniel said. 'I was upset 
because now that I am American citizen I thought they would help me.

'I
 was threatened. They said “well your wife isn’t American, so we can’t 
help”. I felt disgusted. My home is in America and still they won’t 
help. It’s getting uglier and it’s not going in the right direction.’

Mr Wani said the State Department asked him to provide DNA evidence proving that Martin was his biological son.

Rotten

 care: Martin is given a drink by prison guards. Daniel is desperate to 
be allowed to take him home and is fiercely critical of the U.S. Embassy
 for failing to help them and Martin in particular, who is American

He
 added: 'I have provided wedding documents and the baby’s birth 
certificate, but this is clearly not enough. It’s very upsetting that 
they don’t believe me.

'They want me to take a DNA sample in Khartoum, then send it to the US for testing. It’s as if they don’t believe a word I say.’

The Sharia court has postponed her sentence, to give her time to recover from childbirth and to wean the new baby.

Her
 lawyer, Mohaned Mustafa Elnour, a Muslim, has received death threats 
for defending her but has already lodged an appeal. If he does not 
succeed at the Appeal Court, he will take the case to Sudan’s Supreme 
Court. 

Mr
 Elnour said the case hinges around the testimony of two men who claim 
to be her brothers, and one woman who claims to be her mother.

In
 court they claimed that she had disappeared from the family home in a 
small village in the east of Sudan and then discovered her living in 
Khartoum, married to a Christian man.

But
 the lawyer said all three witnesses have proven to be liars because 
their evidence to the court has been highly contradictory.

He
 suggested that the trio are making up their story in an attempt to 
claim ownership of Meriam’s flourishing general store in a shopping mall
 on the outskirts of Khartoum.

Mr
 Elnour added: 'We can prove that Meriam’s mother died in 2012 and that 
the two others are definite fraudsters. But the court is not interested 
in our evidence.’

A petition calling for her release had last week reached more than 661,000.
