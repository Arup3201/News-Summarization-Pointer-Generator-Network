Animal rights groups have condemned a ghoulish Cambodian tourist attraction popular with Britons where live birds are 'ripped apart' by hungry crocodiles.

The cruel 'entertainment' sees crowds of holidaymakers gather round an enclosure before tourists throw live birds down to be eaten alive by the crocodiles below.

Cambodian workers at the Siem Reap Crocodile Farm sell live birds to tourists as 'crocodile food' for $7 - just over £4, according to the Sunday Mirror.

The crocodiles are seen to surround the helpless bird the reptiles' poorly-kept enclosure, before the chicken or duck is attacked and 'ripped to pieces' by one of the famished predators.

Many of the bloodthirsty tourists who take part in the ghoulish feeding frenzy are Britons, while several others film the sickening display on cameras and phones.

One 21-year-old backpacker frmo Sheffield, who was at the farm with a friend, told the Sunday Mirror he had queued up to buy a bird before throwing it to its death.

He then yells with glee as the chicken is thrown into the enclosure, adding: 'Did you see that big ­crocodile storm over? He wasn’t messing about – he ripped it apart. One of the legs is still lying there!'

He told an undercover reporter for the paper: 'That’s what I love about Cambodia. You couldn’t do this back at home.'

Ashley Fruno, a senior campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told holidaymakers to boycott the sick attraction near Angkor Wat Temple, one of Cambodia's most popular tourist sites.

She said: 'Even China has banned live feeding. Cambodia needs to take the same step.

'We are also concerned by the conditions at the farms and the ­suffering crocodiles endure.'
