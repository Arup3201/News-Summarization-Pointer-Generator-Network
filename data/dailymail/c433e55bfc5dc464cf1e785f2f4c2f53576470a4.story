Ageless Wonder: Maimi Rearden was 114 when she died Wednesday in a Georgia hospital. She was America's oldest citizen at the time she passed

Age never deterred Mamie Rearden.

The 114-year-old Edgefield, South Carolina woman, who was the oldest living American when she died Wednesday at a Georgia hospital, got her driver's license at the tender age of 65, or nearly 40 years ago, and rejoined the workforce at 70.

When she died, Rearden was more than a year younger than the world's oldest person, 115-year-old Jiroemon Kimura, who is still going strong in Japan.

'She lived a full, beautiful and inspirational life,' reportedly reads her obituary, published in a South Carolina newspaper.

Rearden, who relatives say broke her hip in a fall three weeks ago, became the oldest American after Dina Manfredini, 115, of Iowa died last month.

Robert Young of the Gerontology Research Group said Rearden's September 1898 birth was recorded in the 1900 U.S. Census.

Rearden counts 10 surviving children, as well as nine grandchildren, 10 great grandchildren, one great-great grandchild, six step grandchildren, a host of step great grandchildren and too many nieces, nephews, and friends to count.

In addition to her six surviving sons and four surviving daughters, Rearden also had one son, John Wilson, who died before her.

When she died, Rearden still improbably trailed 115-year-old Jiroemon Kimura (pictured) as the world's oldest living human being

Rearden only owned the mantle of 'oldest American' for about two weeks, after having assumed it from Dina Manfredini, an Iowa woman who recently died at the age of 115

She was married in 1919 to Oacy Rearden - the same year that 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson's 'Black Sox' were embroiled in a sports-gambling hubbub after throwing the World Series.

The ageless wonder received her teaching certificate in 1918 and began teaching at Faulkner Mountain School in Edgefield County, although she halted her career upon marriage.

At age 70, Rearden reportedly returned to the workforce as a case worker with the South Carolina office of Economic Opportunity, a position that required her to drive around the county to check on under-privileged citizens.

According to her obituary, Rearden and her husband, 'instilled in their children at a very early age the importance of having Godly, righteous, moral and ethical values. They were all taught the importance of integrity and getting a good education.'

In 2008, Rearden was honored by the South Carolina State Senate and the South Carolina House of Representatives.

She enjoyed reading, knitting, crocheting, and sewing, according to her obituary, as well as 'cooking for her family, and the many friends who visited almost on a weekly basis.'
