In the days leading up to laying siege and taking hostages in Martin Place, Man Haron Monis was engaged in rants on his personal Twitter account which seemed to grow more strident as Monday approached.

The account appears to be genuine, although his Tweets linked to a Facebook page which has been pulled down.

On December 10, just five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe with a sawn-off shotgun, Monis raged on Twitter: 'Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of'.

His anger is directed at Australia's foreign policy of sending troops off to fight overseas. The theme is similar to that of a letter addressed to Tony Abbott and posted on his website a year ago, saying the country's foreign policy meant 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'.

Escalating rant: In the days and weeks leading up to his hostage taking siege in Martin Place, Man Haron Monis became more strident on his Twitter (above) and railed against Australia for sending troops to fight in foreign wars

Murdered wife: Noleen Hayson Pal was married to Man Haron Monis and bore him two children, but a bitter custody dispute over their sons preceded her murder which was allegedly plotted by Monis and his Muslim convert girlfriend

Evil countdown: Five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe armed with a shotgun, Man Haron Monis lashed out at 'racist and terrorist Australians' who supported 'Team Australia' and Tony Abbott's foreign policy

Bitter man:  'Sheikh Haron' was bitter about being convicted of sending hate mail to the families of Australian diggers and wrote a self- serving attempt at justification in a letter to the prime minister

Letter of doom: This is the letter sent by Man Haron Monis late last year to Prime Minister Tony Abbott and requesting a live debate on the issue of sending troops to fight in wars overseas

Fateful words: Writing as 'Sheikh Haron', Man Haron Monis ends his letter to Mr Abbott with the fateful words, which he typed in bold in the final sentence, 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'

On the Thursday before the siege, he complained about 'death threats on his page 'based on religious hate' and then praises Australian Muslims for choosing 'Team Islam'.

He railed against former prime minister Kevin Rudd for criticising him and the fact he was 'for five years on bail conditions'; following his conviction for sending vile hate letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died fighting in Afghanistan.

Angry man: Man Haron Monis posted this Tweet just under three weeks before his armed siege, criticising America 'and its allies' for killing 'innocent civilians including women' in wars like Iraq and Afghanistan

In a document from his website entitled 'Who is Sheikh Haron', Monis also likens himself to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and says the 40 sexual assault charges against him - which relate to his practice as a 'spiritual healer' in Western Sydney - are false and politically motivated.

In a letter written in Arabic to 'Muslim brothers and sisters' and placed on his website, he says there is no such thing as a 'moderate Muslim. and that 'I am neither an extremist nor a moderate, I am just a Muslim, a Muslim who tries to follow the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of prophet Muhammad.'

Much of his anger on his Twitter page seems directed at Australia and the US for sending troops to fight in places like Iraq.

'Every day America and its allies kill the innocent civilians including women and children,' he posted just under three weeks ago and in a Tweet posted on November 29 in Arabic , he wrote 'Celebration of Christmas or to kill Muslims in Iraq?

Two weeks before that he wrote, 'Will Australia be Islamic state one day? What do you think?'.

A letter in Arabic to Muslims, in which Man Haron Monis states 'there is no such thing as moderate Muslim'.

The page is littered with photographs and videos of alleged atrocities against Muslims accompanied by comments from Monis including on November 9, 'Do USA & its allies care about Human Rights? YOU MODERATES should be ashamed of yourself for your support'.

His opposition to Australia and other western countries sending troops to fight in wars overseas is reflected in the letter sent to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and obtained by Daily Mail Australia.

In the letter, which Monis makes the bogus claim of being a 'Muslim Cleric and Peace Activist', he says 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'.

He writes a long-winded criticism about Australia's involvement in the Afghanistan war, and a lame self-justification of his vile letters he sent - and was convicted for sending - to the families of soldiers killed over there.

'Since the message of my letters to the Australian authorities couldn't be heard, I wrote letters to some of the families of deceased Australian soldiers and I requested them to voice against the war.

'Those families like the majority of the Australians were fed up with the wrong foreign policy.'

Monis then complains that the Australian Federal Police 'tried to take revenge' and he 'was sentenced to 300 hours community service and two year good behaviour bond'.

'When I talk about "peace" it's not just playing with words but I am very serious and I have paid a price for that.' 

He then writes that like 'the majority of Australians' he wanted 'peace on the earth including Australia' and 'a secured world including Australia'.

Finally, he asks whether Mr Abbott's 'team are happy to have a live debate with me and'or my team'.

He says if he lost the debate he would 'support the Australian government policy for the rest of my life'.

But in his final sentence, Monis writes that he expected the prime minister to change its foreign policy if the debate proved it had 'made Australia unsafe' and if it was proven 'that Australia and Australians will be attacked'.
