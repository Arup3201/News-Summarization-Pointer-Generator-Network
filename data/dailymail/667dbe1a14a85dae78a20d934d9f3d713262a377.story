Wigan Athletic's loss to Sheffield Wednesday at the DW Stadium was overshadowed by the news returning striker Grant Holt faces up to a year on the sidelines with a suspected cruciate knee ligament injury.

The 10-man Latics were beaten 1-0 by the Owls in their final game of 2014 and will begin the new calendar year in the Sky Bet Championship's bottom three.

Their failings in front of goal were all too evident in a third straight home loss and Mackay had hoped Holt, who was sent on loan to Huddersfield after falling out with previous boss Uwe Rosler, could remedy some of their problems in attack.

However, Mackay revealed the 33-year-old would be unable to spearhead any possible Wigan revival after suffering a serious injury in his final loan game with the Terriers at Rotherham on Boxing Day.

'We scanned his injury late last night and it's pretty devastating, he's going to be out for nine to 12 months with a knee injury,' Mackay said.

'He's devastated and we are for him.

'He came off on Saturday after a pretty innocuous challenge. He limped off. We scanned it and spoke to a specialist and it was confirmed.

'We spoke to him this morning and he's got a knee injury that's going to keep him out for nine to 12 months.

'There's a good chance it's cruciates.

'He was going to be one who was going to come in and I'm pretty sure he'd have finished something tonight, I really do. He's an experienced striker and he would have been a good one for us to come in.'
