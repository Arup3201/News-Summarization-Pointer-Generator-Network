AirAsia passengers were left stranded on the tarmac for about an hour with vomiting travellers on-board after they had to make an unscheduled landing in Melbourne.

One of the passengers, known only as Amanda, called 2GB radio station on Tuesday claiming to be on Flight D7 223, which was on its way to Kuala Lumpur to Sydney.

The caller said the plane had been diverted to Melbourne after its 11.55am departure and did not know had they ended up there.

She said people had started throwing up after the plane spent 20 minutes before landing circling the Victoria capital. 

'Everyone's vomiting, everyone's sick. I have no idea what's going on... I'm pretty nervous.' Amanda said.

'What happened was when we were descending the plane took off again.

'We're not sure why. The plane circled Melbourne for a little bit, another 20 minutes, there was so much turbulence.'

Passengers were stranded for a total of three hours before they took off again

Passengers were stranded for a total of three hours before they took off again.

To add to their discomfort, they were not allowed to exit the aircraft even after it was switched off, causing sweltering temperatures on-board without the air-conditioning running.

Amanda said other passengers who had asked crew members why they could not get off the plane were told it was because of safety reasons and it would be a hassle to get them back on again.

An AirAsia X spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia the flight had been diverted to Melbourne due to 'a technical issue'.

'The diversion is in compliance with all international aviation safety guidelines and [the plane] landed safely at 1400hrs in Melbourne,' he said.

Despite media reporting it was an emergency landing, the spokesman clarified it was in fact a 'precautionary diversion'.

'Upon completion of all necessary safety inspection, the said aircraft departed Melbourne at 1713hrs [local time] and is expected to arrive into Kuala Lumpur at 2221hrs [local time] tonight,' he added. 

It has been a troubling few months for AirAsia when its safety record was questioned after Flight Q8501 crashed into the Java Sea in December, killing all 162 people on-board.

Debris from the plane and bodies of the passengers are still being retrieved from the ocean.
