The father of baby and a toddler, who died after their mother left them in a shower for 10 hours when she passed out, told an inquest that his former partner was simply exhausted and not depressed.

Miranda Hebble, who was 22 at the time of the tragedy, left her sons Lochlan and Malachi Stevens in the bathroom at their house in Perth, Australia, for ten hours after she passed out.

When she woke up she discovered ten-month-old Malachi floating in the shower on his side with bruises on his cheek while Lochlan, two, was lying on the floor with blood coming from his mouth.

Father Christopher Stevens with sons Lochlan (left) and Malachi, said he did not believe his then-partner was depressed, but just exhausted

Ms Hebble had been caring for the boys at home alone while their father, Christopher Stevens, was working on a fly-in fly-out basis, the Australian Associated Press reported.

Mr Stevens told the court today that Ms Hebble suffered from anaemia and struggled to adapt her sleeping patterns to those of her sons, NineMSN reported.

Instead of napping when the children slept, she would watch television.

Despite having a baby monitor she would fall asleep while the children wept or screamed, he told the court.

Miranda Hebble left the boys - aged two years and 10 months - in the bathroom and closed the door, before either passing out or falling asleep

Mr Stevens said although his former partner was a quiet, antisocial person who would not let problems affect her, and he did not believe she was depressed.

'She likes being alone. She always has,' he said.

'If there's any form of conflict she wouldn't go near it.'

Lochlan had smeared faeces from his nappy on floors, walls and the baby's cot, spurring her to put the boys in the shower to clean them up.

She left to fetch something, closing the bathroom door behind her, but fell asleep before she could return, the inquest was told.

When she returned to the bathroom, some ten hours later, both children were dead.

Ms Hebble told an emergency services operator: 'I passed out and the plug in the shower got plugged up ... and the shower filled up ... and they're not breathing. They're dead.'

Doctors pronounced both boys dead at 2am the following morning.

Post-mortem examinations could not reach a definitive conclusion as to how Ms Hebble's sons died in November 2008.

Drowning may have caused Malachi's death while Lochlan may have suffered exhaustion, hunger and possible hypothermia with exposure, said forensic pathologist Dr Jodi White.

The inquest continues.
