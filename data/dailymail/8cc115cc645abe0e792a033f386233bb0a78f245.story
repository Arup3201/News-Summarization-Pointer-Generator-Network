The former Melbourne private school student accused of murdering a homeless man told his victim that his father was a werewolf before attacking him, a court has heard.

Easton George Woodhead, 19, stabbed Morgan Wayne 'Mousey' Perry as he lay on his mattress with a group of homeless people living on the banks of Melbourne's Yarra River, the Melbourne Magistrates Court heard.

Prosecutor Michele Williams SC said Woodhead approached the group who were set up under a bridge in the city's centre claiming one of them had stolen his motorbike.

Easton George Woodhead's lawyer Michael Tovey said there was no dispute that Woodhead (pictured) stabbed and killed Morgan Wayne 'Mousey' Perry, but his state of mind at the time would be at issue

Mr Perry responded by telling Woodhead to 'p*** off', Ms Williams said.

The court heard Woodhead then pulled a combat knife from his pocket and started waving it around, before standing on a milk crate and addressing the group, telling them he had recently discovered his father was a werewolf.

Ms Williams said Woodhead then jumped on Mr Perry as he lay on his mattress and started stabbing him in the early hours of January 4 this year.

Woodhead had recently completed his year 12 studies at Melbourne Grammar and his former classmates had noticed his heavy use of marijuana and erratic behaviour, the court heard on Monday.

One friend, Matthew Caldwell, said Woodhead began ranting about bizarre topics, including vampires and werewolves, and carrying around a bulletproof vest.

Mr Caldwell said Woodhead spoke of being recruited by the Australian Special Air Service (SAS) for the 'special abilities' he possessed.

'Special abilities he had that others didn't,' Mr Caldwell told the court.

He also believed he was in an ongoing battle with werewolves and vampires and feared they were following him, Mr Caldwell said.

'It was a battle between him and the werewolves and vampires,' he said.

Woodhead could become manic, talking for hours at a time and also discussed the possibility of injecting ink from printer cartridges into his veins to make himself immortal, according to Mr Caldwell.

Woodhead's barrister Michael Tovey QC said there was no dispute that Woodhead stabbed and killed Mr Perry, but his state of mind at the time of the incident would be at issue.

'There will be focus on the bizarre and delusional behaviour of Easton Woodhead in the days and months leading up to the stabbing,' he said. 

Woodhead's committal hearing continues.
