A viral video is causing uproar online for giving step by step instructions on how to avoid a DUI arrest.

The lawyer who created the controversial method says he's just trying to prevent false arrests, but safe driving advocates think it encourages drunk driving. 

The video posted on New Year's Day, one of the most dangerous days for drunk driving, shows a Levy County, Florida man preparing to enter a DUI checkpoint by putting his license, insurance and a flyer in a plastic bag.

Your get out of DUI kit: A viral video shows you how to avoid arrest for drunk driving at a DUI checkpoint. It advises drivers to put their ID, insurance and a flyer that reads 'I remain silent, no searches, I want my lawyer' in a plastic bag and then rolling the window up for police officers to inspect

Above, a detailed view of the flyer, which details the driver's rights including the right to remain silent 

Doors closed: Leaving the documents outside the vehicle for waiting officers to inspect is crucial the driver in the video explains, since 'the second that you open the window they can say they smell alcohol'

The flyer details the driver's rights and reads: 'I remain silent, no searches, I want my lawyer'.'

The bag is connected to a string, so that he can roll the window all the way up. Leaving the documents outside the vehicle for waiting officers to inspect is crucial.  

'The second that you open the window they can say they smell alcohol or drugs coming from the vehicle and the moment you speak a word they can claim that you speech is slurred,' the man says. 

As the man pulls up to the checkpoint, a handful of officers walk up to the vehicle and seem baffled by the bag. One officer reads the flyer with the aid of a flashlight, before sending the driver on his way - no questions asked. He even waves goodbye with a smile. 

For a good cause: A Boca Raton lawyer created the guidelines for the flyer, and says he just wants to protect drivers' rights. Above, a DUI checkpoint officer checks the packet 

Bad example? The driver is waved away with no questions. Some have criticized the video for promoting drunk driving

Boca Raton lawyer Warren Redlich is the person who wrote the guidelines for the flyer, and says he's just trying to prevent drivers from being wrongly accused of DUI and doesn't encourage drunk driving.

'It's not designed for drunks and I don't think it really works for drunks because you have to follow instructions and drunks aren't good at that,' he told WPTV. 

But Tara Kirschner, who works for safe-driving organization Dori Saves Lives, was outraged after seeing the video.   

'It's not the example we want to set for our youth. we want them to learn how to do the right things,' she said. 

Designer: Boca Raton Lawyer Warren Redlich came up with the guidelines used in the video. Pictured above when he was running for New York State Governor in 2010.
