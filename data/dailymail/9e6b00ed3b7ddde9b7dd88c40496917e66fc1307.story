Beyoncé's Grammy Awards performance was slammed by concerned parents on Sunday as they deemed the incredibly risqué routine too explicit for children to watch.

The 32-year-old singer wore a revealing black thong bodysuit over fishnet tights to perform a rendition of her hit Drunk In Love alongside husband Jay Z at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.

Beyoncé's sexy dance routine, which aired at 8pm on both coasts and at 7pm central time, had many furious parents posting comments on social media that the performance was 'disrespectful', had 'no class' and was entirely inappropriate for young viewers.

From start to end, the mother-of-one's routine could only be described as both seductive and risqué.

She
 opened the show straddling a chair then 
proceeded to writhe around on it before twerking her way up to a standing 
position.

Belting
out
 the lyrics to the explicit song, many of which had been bleeped out, it wasn't too long 
before she was 
joined onstage by husband Jay Z, who looked dapper in a black spotted tuxedo.

Getting up from 
the chair, Beyonce then embarked in a spot of back-to-back slow and sexy
dancing with her husband, running her hands up and down his leg and 
bottom in moves Miley Cyrus would have been proud of.

The 44-year-old rapper couldn't help but get touchy feely with his wife, clasping his hands on
her famous derriere and giving her a sultry kiss mid-song.

The audience at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles went wild for the first live joint performance of the song from music's number one couple, who raked in a combined $95million last year.

However the audience at home appeared to be less impressed.

Viewer Katie Stapp wrote: 'Come
 on people!! Yeah Beyoncé has an amazing voice but that 
outfit?!?!? Completely no class. Give children something to look up to 
#absurd.'

And Stephen G. Peters tweeted: 'Sorry Beyoncé!!! Class ALWAYS wins! It wins for our children. Sad day when our kids can't even watch the Grammy's! #Puzzled.'

Voicing their opinions: Countless viewers took to Twitter to comment on Beyoncé and Jay Z's performance of Drunk In Love

Theresa Bailey commented: 'Beyonce 
seriously? It's 8:00. That performance was NOT appropriate for children.
 Thank God mine are in bed. #shameonyou.'

Leah Simmons wrote: 'All it took was a clip of Beyoncé twerking to say I would
 never let my children watch the Grammys. Won't even go into the other 
reasons...'

And Maria Sanz commented: 'Watching
 the #GRAMMYs at 8pm with my children(music lovers) performance by 
Beyoncé and her lack of clothing very inappropriate, she's a mom?'

Another user called JJ Boogie tweeted: 'Opening Grammy song performance inappropriate for young children. Thank you Beyonce. #ChannelChange.'

Some viewers felt even more strongly 
about the performance, with Melissa Merry writing: 'Beyoncé looked a 
W***e onstage. Just goes to show no respect for little children watching
 the Grammy show.'

Twitter user clarkette added: 'Beyoncé can twerk and dance dirty on stage by oh if Miley does it she's such a horrible person.'

Despite comparisons to Cyrus's explicit performance with married singer Robin Thicke at last year's MTV Video Music Awards, many fans rushed to defend Queen Bey's shimmying up to husband Jay Z.

Sophie Choudry tweeted: 'Can there possibly be a more talented, inspiring, awesome couple in the world of showbiz?'

Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland tweeted: 'Tonight also justified my obsession (of over a decade) with @Pink That woman is everything. Oh and also @Beyonce that's all.'

Woah. Beyonce looked incredible last night on stage at the Grammys.

It was obviously great to see her performing with her hubby Jay-Z but when she's in an outfit like this it's hard to focus on anything else. This is a racy combination of bondage and bodysuit and we're loving the glitzy bra and of course those amazing tights.

If you think you've seen this particular hosiery before then you're right. These Saint Laurent tights, embellished with Swarovski crystals have been a big hit with sexy starlets everywhere. First they were seen on the AW13 runway and then the full bodysuit look was seen on the queen of supermodels, Kate Moss before finding a new home on Kylie Minogue and now Beyonce.

These are some very expensive tights and you wouldn't want to get a ladder in them... but when they're this cool sometimes you just have to plurge. Click the link (right) to buy a pair now from Barneys... if you've got £782 to spare.

Or why not get this look on the high street. Pretty Polly at River Island have a cheap as chips pair or try Jonathan Aston's 'Starburst' tights at Asos or even Wolford's studded tights. But we suggest styling them with a cute mini skirt or leather shorts. Bodysuits are definitely optional.

Beyoncé's performance comes after she admitted in a recent mini-documentary that she is proud to embrace her sexuality.

She said: 'I don’t have any shame 
about being sexual. I’m not embarrassed about it. And I don’t feel like I
 have to protect that side of me.'

The singer's often overtly-sexual performances haven't put off President Obama praising Beyoncé as an important role model for children - including his own.

He
 said recently: 'Beyoncé could not be a better role model for my girls 
because she carries herself with such class and poise and has so much 
talent.'

Controversial: Many viewers tweeted that if Miley Cyrus had done a similar routine, she would have been slammed for it. Here, she is seen twerking with Robin Thicke at the MTV VMA Awards last August

Hypocritical: Many viewers commented on what would have happened if Miley had performed the routine
