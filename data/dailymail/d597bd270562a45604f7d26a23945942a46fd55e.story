Callum Cuenca, 15, walked away with only a broken arm after plunging 160ft off a cliff

A schoolboy survived a 160ft plunge off a cliff during a camping trip with only a broken arm.

Callum Cuenca, 15, was camping with friends when he accidentally took a wrong turn, slipped and tumbled over the cliff edge.

Despite the fall, Callum managed to ring his father from his mobile phone to raise the alarm.

The schoolboy was found trapped in trees 160ft down, which saved him from plunging a further 50ft to the bottom of the cliff in Hanham, Bristol.

His father Simon Cooper said: 'I was a bit shocked when he told me where he was. He told me he was stuck and he thought he had dislocated his arm.

'He was more interested that he had dropped his iPad and rucksack then what had actually happened to him.

'He was meant to be camping with mates and he went a different way to the two of them and, because it had been raining, he slipped and went over.

'He was very lucky, very, very lucky.'

Firefighters from Avon Fire and Rescue found him at about 8.30pm on Wednesday as they were lowered down from the top of the cliff.

They spent 90 minutes treating his injuries and freeing him from the undergrowth but said he continued to crack jokes throughout the rescue.

Callum, from Kingswood, Bristol, was then put onto a stretcher and safely lowered the rest of the way down the cliff, where waiting paramedics rushed him to hospital.

Fire Service spokesman Darren Bane said: 'He has been very fortunate. There are a lot of trees and undergrowth on the cliff which undoubtedly broke his fall.

'This could have been an awful lot worse.'

Mr Cooper said his son was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital where he was X-rayed and found to have broken the top side of his left arm.

Mr Cooper said: 'I rushed straight to him and he was dangling about 15ft above me.

'He was laughing and joking and making wise cracks to the people rescuing him on the ropes.

'They put him in a sling and let him come home.

'He's going to give his teachers a shock when he goes back to school, especially because he had a few exams next week.'

Jim Yearsly, who saw the rescue, said: 'There was a mountain rescue vehicle too. It's a sheer drop. He was a lucky chap.'
