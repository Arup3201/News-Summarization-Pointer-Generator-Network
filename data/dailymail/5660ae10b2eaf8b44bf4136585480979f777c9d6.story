A partially blind dog has survived a fall from the balcony outside his owner's downtown Sacramento condominium by landing in a hot tub 15 stories below.

The Sacramento Bee reported Wednesday that the 13-year-old Boston terrier, named Sammy, was dog-paddling in the hot tub when workers went to investigate the cause of a giant splash they heard this.

His owner's mother watches Sam during the day and tells The Bee that at first she assumed the dog had taken the stairs down, but then realized he couldn't have gotten out of the condo without slipping through the balcony's railing.

The fall occurred at the Bridgeway Towers apartment block, which is one of the tallest buildings in Sacramento.

Christmas miracle: Sammy, a 13-year-old Boston terrier, should not have survived a big balcony fall, but manage to land in a small hot tub below

Long way town: The Bridgeway Towers apartment block is one of the tallest buildings in Sacramento

Splash: Sammy somehow managed to land in this tiny hot tub from 15 floors up

Lucky: The Boston terrier's owner admits there is now way his dog should have survived

'All of a sudden, I knew,' Bette Plumb said.

'It hit me immediately: He fell.'

The pet suffered five broken ribs and several fractures to his pelvis in Monday's fall and is recovering at an animal hospital.

Sam's owner, Bill McCourt, says his dog enjoys catching sun on the balcony but will have to stay inside from now on.

'He shouldn't have survived,' McCourt told KCRA.

Recovering: Sammy broke five ribs and fractured his pelvis in the fall, but is otherwise fine

Emotional: Owner Bill McCourt fights back tears as he explains what happened to Sammy from the balcony where he fell

On-the-mend: The 13-year-old dog is a member of the family, his owner says

'To the east of the balcony is a pool and hot tub and the dog went directly into the hot tub.

'He hit the hot tub and started swimming to try to get out and swam about three times to the stairs and managed to pull himself out.'

'It's a Christmas miracle.' 

'Whenever I tell someone what happened, they keep saying, ''The 15th floor? Are you sure it was the 15th floor?'' because no one can believe it. 

'They’re completely amazed.'
