All Canadian bobsledder Heather Moyse wanted to do was take an Epsom salt  bath, but since there were no bathtubs in Sochi, Russia she had to bathe in a giant trash can instead.

On February 16, the blonde and bubbly bobsledder took a humorous photo of herself bathing in a green tub of water and shared it on her twitter account.

'No bath tubs in the Mountain Village... So just chillin' in a garbage bin doing a hot Epsom salt 'bath'! #NoExcuses,' she said.

The picture was re-tweeted 493 times and is just one of the #SochiProblems athletes and visitors are experiencing.

Several athletes hurt themselves on Sochi's steep slopes and American Olympians such as Shaun White had to leave the game after being injured.

Moyse, who underwent surgery in 2012, uses Epsom salt baths to soothe her hurting body, reports The Huffington Post.

'My hip sockets ... for around 98 percent of people they open facing forward. Mine, they discovered, rotate backwards,' she told Reuters.

'Everything I've accomplished up until my surgery was in spite of being blocked in the front which is why I have that really weird pushing style. But elite athletes become elite compensators. I'm pushing faster than I've ever pushed before -- part of that is down to the surgery,' she continued.

Epsom salt soothes muscles and also helps restore magnesium and sulfate in the body.

Apparently the Epsom salt baths are working wonders because she and her partner Kallie Humphries came in second place in the women's bobsled competition at the Sochi games.
