An all-day end-of-term college party ended in a brutal bloodbath early Tuesday, with five people in their late teens and early twenties stabbed to death inside a student house in Calgary.

Police were called to the home in the residential neighborhood of Brentwood about 1.20am, with paramedics declaring three men dead at the scene.

One woman and another man later died in hospital from their injuries.

Police have arrested a suspect in the multiple murder case, with canine units tracking down a man in his 20's who had fled the scene, with the Calgary Sun saying he is the son of a 'senior police officer'.

The suspect has not yet been charged, but Calgary police said officers are not seeking any other people in relation to the crime.

'The name of the offender will be released once charges have been laid,' police said in a statement, according to CTV Calgary.

Officials are still working to notify the next of kin of the victims and will not be releasing their names until autopsies are performed.

'Multiple witnesses' are currently being interviewed, police said.

It is not known whether the five victims were students at the University of Calgary, which is just a few blocks from the scene.

Police said the gruesome scene was a college party.

'The party had been going for several hours and there were a few dozen people there, it would be fair to say,' police spokeswoman Emma Poole told NBC News.

'We believe it was a college party because it was the last day of classes and the University of Calgary is just blocks away. Lots of students live in this area.'

The college also put a statement on its website saying it was 'mourning the loss of five young people killed early this morning in Brentwood'.

'The identities of the deceased have not yet been confirmed by Calgary Police Services. Once details are confirmed by Calgary Police Services, the university will provide a further statement.'

CTV Calgary reported that was the University of Calgary student union’s annual 'Bermuda Shorts Day' to mark the last day of classes.

Neighbors said the students who rent the house had been partying throughout the day without incident.

Doug Jones, who lives across the street from the house, says about a dozen students appeared to be having a barbecue in the backyard in the evening.

'It was like a normal gathering; it wasn’t loud, it wasn’t unruly,' he told the TV station.

'Around dusk, they moved inside, and then we didn’t really hear anything.'

'We woke up this morning to yellow tape in the back alley here. I was in shock when the reporters told us what happened.'
