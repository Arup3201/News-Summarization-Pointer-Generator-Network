An American woman who was kidnapped in Yemen is expected to stand up in court against the Islamic hate preacher who orchestrated her terrifying ordeal.

Mary Quin was abducted along with 15 other tourists in 1998 by militants who were instructed by hate preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri.

During the tour group's rescue, she was used as a human shield and four other hostages were killed.

preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri (R) appears before before U.S. Magistrate 
Judge Frank Maas (L) in Federal Court in New York

Hamza appeared at federal court in New York on Saturday after being extradited from Britain.

Hamza faces 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking
of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998, advocating violent jihad in 
Afghanistan in 2001 and conspiring to establish a jihad training camp in
Bly, Oregon, between June 2000 and December 2001.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called the extraditions 'a watershed moment in our nation's efforts to eradicate terrorism.'

He
added: 'As is charged, these are men who were at the nerve centers of 
Al Qaeda's acts of terror, and they caused blood to be shed, lives to be
lost, and families to be shattered.'

If found guilty, 54-year-old Hamza is likely to die behind bars.

Ms Quin could be a crucial witness to the trial. After her ordeal in Yemen, she investigated the reasons why her tour group was attacked and discovered that radicals wanted to swop tourists for terror suspects who had been arrested including the son and stepson of Hamza.

She traveled to London when she 
tracked down Hamza at his mosque and demanded he answer her questions to
which he agreed. He admitted helping the militants in Yemen carry out 
the attack. 

Ms Quin, 59, who wrote a book about her experiences in 2005, now lives in Anchorage and runs a boutique.

While at court on Saturday, Hamza demanded the return of his notorious hooks. The
hate preacher, who lost his hands in an explosion, did not enter a plea
during the brief hearing and was remanded in custody ahead of his next 
appearance on Tuesday.

The 
former imam, who had his hooks removed for 
'security reasons', has demanded they are returned so 'he can use his 
arms'.

Also in New York, Adel Abdul Bary and 
Khaled al-Fawwaz pleaded not guilty while earlier in the day Babar Ahmad
and Talha Ahsan pleaded not guilty in a court in Connecticut.

He entered no plea in the Manhattan court, while four other alleged jihadists - Syed Talha Ahsan, Babar Ahmad, Khaled 
al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary - all pleaded not guilty to a series of terrorist offences.

Hamza came into 
court without his recognizable hooks, and with both arms exposed through
his short-sleeved blue prison shirt. His court-appointed lawyer, 
Sabrina Shroff, asked that his prosthetics be immediately returned 'so 
he can use his arms'.

The
Islamist fanatic lost the last of his countless appeals in a legal 
farce that has seen him thwart extradition from Britain for more than eight years.

An armoured police van collected the hate preacher from HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 7.30pm on Friday, just a few hours after the decision was made.

The van, heavily flanked by a 
number of other police vehicles with their emergency lights on, drove more than 130 miles to the U.S Air Force base RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk.

Two planes carrying the suspects took off shortly before midnight. The convoy of vehicles with blue 
flashing lights earlier entered the military base through a side 
entrance at 10.10pm after completing the journey in just under three 
hours.

Paperwork was 
then completed and after years of fighting against it, the group were 
successfully handed over to U.S. marshals, who were waiting to escort 
them on the 3,700-mile flight to the United States.

'Deteriorating health': Abu Hamza asked the High Court to grant him time for an MRI scan as he renewed a long-running legal battle to halt his extradition from the UK to the US

Last week, Hamza’s lawyers – in a move
condemned as a blatant delaying tactic – had gone back to court again 
to claim he was unfit to stand trial.

They
said the ‘harsh’ conditions in his cell at HMP Belmarsh had left him 
unwell, sleep-deprived and depressed – and demanded an MRI scan.

After
a three-day hearing, a judge at the High Court in London said
he was ‘wholly unpersuaded’ by their claims, adding: ‘The sooner he is 
put on trial, the better.’

Making
clear no further appeals would be allowed in the case, Sir John Thomas,
President of the Queen’s Bench Division, rejected the idea that Hamza 
was unfit to plead. If depressed, he said, Hamza could get anti-depressants in the U.S.

He also criticised delays in the 
extradition process, saying it was ‘unacceptable’ that the case should 
have taken so long, and warning of ‘real dangers’ of a system that 
allows repeated appeals on issues that had already been decided.

The judges also rejected legal 
challenges by Babar Ahmad, Syed Ahsan, Khaled Al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul 
Bary, who were part of the convoy to arrive at the airbase.

A
20-seater Gulfstream V jet owned by the US Department of Justice and a 
privately-owned Dassault Falcon 900 jet were visible from the airfield 
perimeter.

The two 
white aircraft were in stark contrast to the base's fleet of United 
States Air Force KC-135 fuel tanker jets and C-130 transport planes.

Official 
flight records reveal that the twin-engine Gulfstream jet arrived at RAF
Mildenhall on Tuesday night after a six hour and 27 minute flight from 
Reagan National airport in Washington DC.

A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said: 'These
extraditions mark the end of a lengthy process of litigation through 
the UK courts and the ECHR.

'The U.S. government agrees with the 
ECHR's findings that the conditions of confinement in U.S. prisons - 
including in maximum security facilities - do not violate European 
standards.

'The law enforcement relationship 
between the United States and United Kingdom is predicated on trust, 
respect, and the common goals of protecting our nations and eliminating 
safe havens for criminals, including terrorists.'

Hamza, who is missing his right 
hand and an eye, has celebrated the September 11 terror attacks 
and preached jihad to a young congregation.

Hamza, who was jailed for seven years
for soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred in 2006, first 
faced an extradition request from America in 2004.

All five cases returned to the High 
Court after judges at the European Court of Human Rights refused to 
intervene and stop the Home Secretary extraditing them.

Between 1999 and 2006, the men were indicted on various terrorism charges in America.

Ahmad,
a computer expert from south London, and Ahsan are accused of offences 
including using a website to provide support to terrorists and 
conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage property in
a foreign country.

They 
wanted their removal stopped so that they could challenge a decision by 
the Director of Public Prosecutions not to allow British businessman 
Karl Watkin, a campaigner against the UK’s extradition arrangements with
the United States, to bring prosecutions against them in the UK.

Bary and Al-Fawwaz were indicted - 
with Osama bin Laden and 20 others - for their alleged involvement in, 
or support for, the bombing of US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
in 1998.Al-Fawwaz faces more than 269 counts of murder.

Hamza once appeared to embrace Western society and worked as a bouncer in a Soho nightclub. He had a reputation for socializing and heavy drinking when he first came to Britain from Egypt 30 years ago.

Born in Alexandria, he studied civil engineering and in 1984 married a British woman, Valerie Fleming. But throughout the 1980s he slowly began to turn towards a fundamentalist interpretation of the Koran.

In 1990 he divorced his wife and returned to Egypt where he reinvented himself as a Muslim 'holy man' or sheikh. He traveled to Pakistan and then on to Afghanistan which was at the time gripped by civil war as differing factions fought to fill the power vacuum left by the retreat of Russian troops.

It is unclear if he fought there but when he returned to the UK with his British passport in the early 1990s he was missing his right hand and an eye. He claims he lost the hand fighting jihad in Afghanistan.

In 1996 he re-emerged at Finsbury Park Mosque in north London preaching jihad to a young congregation.

Then in January 1999 three British 
tourists were killed in Yemen, drawing public attention to the civil war
between fundamentalists and the secular government there, which accused
Abu Hamza of using his mosque to recruit Islamic warriors to the 
fundamentalist cause.

He
was alleged to have been the leader of a cell called Supporters of 
Sharia. Yemen said that it wanted him extradited.

But Hamza continued to court controversy. Following the September 11 attacks in the US, he said: 'Many people will be happy, jumping up and down at this moment'.
