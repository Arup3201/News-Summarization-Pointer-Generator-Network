Sesame Street puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, is facing the threat of a fourth legal suit from a young man alleging sexual abuse at his hands.

He will be represented by Jeff Herman, the attorney for Clash's second and third accusers, Cecil Singleton, 24, and a 29-year-old man so far known only as John Doe.

Mr
Herman is still 'verifying' the fourth man's story, but has told Mail Online, 'It is very similar and so far nothing has fallen by the wayside in vetting it'.

Whatever the outcome of these cases one thing is clear. Clash's life is far from the open book which he suggested when he described himself recently as a 'proud gay man'.

In reality he has lived a double life for decades. It began with an invitation to join in Macy's Thanksgiving parade 33 years ago. Clash was just 17 - a gangly 6 foot boy - wowed to have been invited to New York by an older man he had met only once.

That invitation came from the 
flamboyantly named Kermit Love, a man to whom Clash has professed 
life-long gratitude and loyalty. Love died in 2008 at the age of 91 and 
is survived by partner of 50 years, Christopher Lyall.

'That year many of the Sesame Street 
characters were literally in need of warm bodies, of hands, actually,' Clash has recalled.

'I would be a sort of Muppet temp on the Sesame float, filing in where needed.

'I was so wired on the train up to New York that I couldn't relax of focus on anything.'

Love was a remarkable man with a lifetime's experience of theatre, costume design and puppets. 

He worked with choreographers like George Balanchine, designed costumes for the Joffre Ballet and created Big Bird and the mammoth like Mr Snuffleupagus.

He spoke with an affected English, sometimes French, accent though he was from New Jersey and he was Kevin Clash's first entre into a world that was exotic, exhilarating and far removed from his Baltimore background. Clash has called them his 'fairy godmothers'.

Clash is now the older man. But the difference is that Clash is being accused of a much more sinister 'game of father and son', as one of his accusers put it. 

Clash grew up in Turner's Station, a
blue-collar community just east of Baltimore, Maryland. His father, 
George, was a flash welder, his mother, Gladys, ran a 'home-style 
daycare centre' from the two bedroom, one bathroom home in which Kevin was raised with his three siblings.

It was a hardworking, loving environment but, from the very start, it was one from which Clash stood apart. In a neighbourhood where kids played hopscotch, rode bicycles and jumped rope Clash had a fascination with fabric, old buttons, his mother's discarded house-slippers...anything from which he could make the puppets he loved from watching children's television shows.

As a young man living in Baltimore Clash lived one life: in New York he lived another entirely

Driven by passion: Clash age 19, in New York on the set of children's show, 'Captain Kangaroo'

As a boy Clash put on puppet shows for the children at his mother's daycare centre.

While other kids played sport, Clash performed puppet shows for the children at his mother's day-care. Neighbours and peers thought his fascination was out of the ordinary, not that it bothered Clash.

When he was 15 he performed at the local heritage fair in Dundalk. He made his own puppets, built his own set and met his first mentor as a result - local television host Stu Kerr. He was a fixture on local CBS affiliate WMAR, news announcer, weatherman, popular children's entertainer.

He approached Kevin after his show and asked him to audition for a show he was putting together. 'I'd never had a boss before,' Clash recalls. 'I had to master the art of give and take'.

It was an art he mastered and by the time he was 17, Clash was obsessed.

Kermit Love - whose shared first name with Jim Henson's famous frog is only coincidental - came into Clash's life when he his puppet workshop was featured in a television show.

Clash was 'blown away' he recalls in his memoir, My Life as a Furry Red Monster.

It was his mother who encouraged her son to make contact, to look up Mr Love's number and give him a call. Nervous and fearful of rejection Clash did just that. 'We spoke for about ten minutes,' he writes. 'Before hanging up he invited me to come up to his workshop for a visit'.

As luck would have it Clash's school, Dundalk High, had a trip to New York planned. For Clash, this included a personal visit to Mr Love's Greenwich Village workshop. The man looked, Clash recalled, 'like Santa Claus,' with his long white beard and workshop full of marionettes and muppets. They kept in touch - the 17-year-old fan and the mentor four decades his senior.

After that stint he returned to Baltimore. He hung out at his mother's daycare centre. He observed the kids, 'how their emotions turned on a dime'. He studied them to improve his art and years later putting into practice those observations in the tactile character of Elmo.

When Love telephoned and invited Clash 
to join in Macy's Thanksgiving parade his parents, he says, 'didn't 
hesitate to let me go'. They dropped him off at the station.

Clash spent the night in Love's Greenwich Village workshop. 'Kermit had a pull-out futon in the office area,' he remembers in his memoir. 'and I dutifully got ready for bed trying to avoid the temptation to poke around...I couldn't sleep and eventually abandoned the futon, giving in to my urge to check things out'.

Over the course of the next day's parade Clash was introduced to the cadre of puppeteers who would become his colleagues and companions on his increasingly regular visits to Manhattan.

Richard Hunt was key among them. A talented puppeteer who died of AIDS in 1992.

Hunt was openly gay - when Rudolf Nureyev made a guest appearance on the Muppet Show he notoriously and rather bluntly hit on Hunt.

It was Hunt who, four years later, threw a small red muppet in Clash's direction and said 'Give him a voice'. That voice was that of the Elmo that millions of children so love today.

After the Thanksgiving Parade he remained in touch with the Sesame Street puppeteers.

He travelled regularly to Manhattan, shared an apartment with a fellow struggling artist Jim Martin and started to establish his 'big city' life supported by his 'fairy godmothers'.

Kermit Love was 'generous with his time' and often on set as both puppeteer and Sesame Street character, Willy the Hot Dog man.

Meanwhile, back in Baltimore Clash 
lived a different life entirely.

At the age of 19 he met Genia, a 
student nurse and they began dating. In 1983 he was invited to be a full
time cast member on one season of Sesame Street, though was still to secure his own character.

Double life: Genia, above, was married to Clash for 17 years and they had a daughter, Shannon, right

Clash and Genia married in 1986. Genia gave birth to their daughter, Shannon, in 1993 and it is clear that both remain committed, loving and mutually supportive parents.They were together for 17 years before, as Clash puts it, they 'finally admitted the relationship was in trouble'.

After all, his life was increasingly riven between that of his Manhattan circle and his Baltimore family.

Perhaps it was inevitable that the two lives - one that began with that invitation to New York from Love, the other embarked upon with Clash's own proposal of marriage - would prove unsustainable. Though none could have imagined quite how catastrophically they would be thrust into the spotlight.

Clash's lawyer has said that the allegations have 'no merit' and that his client's reputation will be 'robustly defended' should the cases go to trial.

But for the time being the man whose career was made by finding a voice remains silent. And the voice of Elmo has become the 
face of something altogether less endearing.
