Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has accused the FA of making him an example for years while they have bigger issues to tackle.

The 36-year-old labelled the FA 'ludicrous' in October following his three-match ban and £25,000 fine for using the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female - in reply to a criticising tweet.

It was the second time in two years Ferdinand had been reprimanded on Twitter after being fined £45,000 for appearing to endorse a description of Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice'.

The former Manchester United star previously questioned the FA for not prosecuting former Cardiff City duo Malky Mackay and Iain Moody a month ago, who Sportsmail revealed sent and received sexist, racist and homophobic texts and emails.

'They have many, many bigger issues going on that needed a lot more attention than my ban,' he told the Independent. 

'I have got used to being made an example over the years when it comes to the FA. I didn't speak to one person who said they agreed with the sanctions - and I never said I was right. 

'I just think the severity of the ban and everything else to do with it was crazy. There was no realism with what they did. 

'Someone has got to be made an example and the FA thinks it is good to make me that guy. I am used to it now.'
