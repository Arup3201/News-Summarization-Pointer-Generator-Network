On an average day, street performers count themselves lucky to wrangle a wry smile out of passers-by - let alone a coin.

To merit a dancing partner? Simply unfathomable.

But eccentric entertainer Spandy Andy was treated to just that when a little toddler leaped out from the crowds in a heart-warming moment of spontaneity.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Heart-melting: The video starts with Spandy Andy, a professional dancer from Canada, working his moves for the camera. But then a shy boy jumping in the corner gets lost in the music, and a spontaneous duet ensues

The performance, which has now gone viral, left crowds milling through Edinburgh's streets stunned as the pair darted around each other for almost five minutes.

While Canada-born Andy beamed at the audience, the unnamed stage crasher could have been in his own living room.

At first he was hesitant, standing with his family against St Giles Cathedral in the city centre during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival last August.

But as the spandex-clad dancer scaled round the audience, he turned saw the little boy jumping up and down to the music - We Speak No Americano by Yolanda Be Cool - in a corner.

Encouragement: Andy bounded over to teach the boy some moves and tried to get him to join in

With a high-five it looks like that was the end of it. But suddenly, the boy loses his inhibitions

Andy, who travels the world with his colourful boombox, was elated and bounded over to teach him some moves.

The boy seems happy but hesitant - he copies, but keeps looking down.

Finally,
 Andy gives him a high-five and gestures him into the square. And after 
feigning reluctance for just a second, the boy drops the act and marches
 in.

A couple of ecstatic jumps are all it takes to get him warmed up.

Completely fearless, both bound around as if no one is watching in High Street in Edinburgh this August

Andy plays to the audience and looks over at the boy, but his dance partner is consumed by concentration

In something of a 'superman' move, the boy runs forwards, head down and arms ahead

Andy, who has performed on So You Think You Can Dance Canada, was in awe of the little boy

From that moment on, he is consumed by concentration - eyes on the ground, feet everywhere, arms flailing.

The crowds - and Andy - scream and applaud. And it just keeps coming.

Andy was named Canada's Freshest Dancer 2009 at the Colgate MaxFresh Competition in Toronto, where he was awarded $10,000.

He also performed on So You Think You Can Dance Canada in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and appeared on Wipeout Canada 2011.

But the boy seems unphased as he jumps and twists, flipping his hands upwards and downwards.

Andy stood back as the boy pulled out moves normally often on shows like Britain's Got Talent

Spandy Andy applauded the little dancer on YouTube saying, 'this kid rocks!'

After more than three minutes, the music slows and Andy bows. But the boy ploughs on.

Commenting on the YouTube video, filmed on August 26, Spandy Andy wrote: 'Let loose. Be free. This kid rocks! It's always a good time for a DANCE PARTY!'

Somebody else wrote: 'This kid its my hero! just live the life! and enjoy the moment!ï»¿And another said: 'This guy is an awesome dancer!'
