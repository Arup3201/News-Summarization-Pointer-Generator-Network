Explorer and documentary maker Ben Cropp has set off on a six week mission to find a 500-year-old cannon which could prove for the first time Portuguese sailors were the first to land in Australia in the early 1520s. 

Mr Cropp, 78, who has more than six decades of diving experience and has discovered over 100 shipwrecks, is searching off the coast of Cooktown in far North Queensland. 

If the crew find what they are looking for it will re-write Australian history books because the Dutch are now recorded as the first Europeans to visit Australia in 1606.

This map from 1542 shows a place called 'Java-la-Grande' (above) which is exactly where Australia is on maps today

Mr Cropp has more than six decades of diving experience and has made more than 150 documentaries on marine life for the National Geographic Channel 

Mr Cropp says maps dated from the 1520s show a large sixth continent  in the same position as present-day Australia, called 'Java-la-Grande' in many similar charts and navigational aids.

The self-described 'wreck hunter' set off from his base in Cairns on Saturday  on the Freedom IV catamaran. The journey will see him stay off Cooktown in North Queensland for a week before continuing his explorations further north towards the remote Cape York at the tip of the country.

He is travelling with four other crew members, including his son Adam Cropp, 31, who is the chief scuba diving guide on National Geographic ships.

This is a 500-year-old Spanish map showiing the coast of Australia created by the first explorers 

Mr Cropp and his team are on the Freedom IV catamaran for the next six weeks looking for a cannon 

Mr Cropp and his crew are searching off the coast of Cooktown, north of Townsville, for the evidence 

The film maker and explorer told Daily Mail Australia from out at sea: 'Three Portuguese ships and a Spanish vessel were lost near Cape York in the 1520s before the Dutch arrived. 

'I have clues as to where the wrecks might be and we are looking for a cannon which will date it. 

'Most historians agree the Portuguese were here first but we have to prove it.'

Mr Cropp discovered this anchor at the Ferguson shipwreck in 1977 which sunk in 1841 in the Lockhart River, Queensland 

Lynn Cropp captured this cannon at wreckage of The Sun ship in 1985 east of Cape York 

'There was an early chart made in 1522, not released until 1542 and it clearly shows the Cooktown area and shows reefs off the coast. 

'It means a lot when something was charted in quite heavy detail and so we know they spent a lot of time here. 

'We believe it was a man called Cristovao de Mendonca was one of the first Portuguese men to have charted the coast of Australia in 1522/23 and he would have been the earliest person that we know of.

'We are looking for the absolute proof of Portuguese landing, there are clues but hopefully this voyage will lead to solid evidence.

'The searching is very hard and has already involved lots of swimming, we are looking for things which have been underwater for 500 years old.

'This was 250 years before Cook and appreciate that when Cook's cannons were found they were a metre under the coral. 

Mr Cropp found these Spanish coins on the wreck of The Sun in 1985 which is east of Cape York on the Ashmore Reef off the coast of Queensland

Mr Cropp and his team will have to spend hours snorkelling looking for historical objects under the coral 

'We are snorkelling in shallow water but we are looking for objects which are probably two metres under the coral.' 

Mr Cropp, who has produced more than 150 marine documentaries since the 1960s, found the Pandora shipwreck which was 135 miles south east off Cape York in 1977- it is the most historical shipwreck in Australia and that sunk in 1791. 

1401: Chinese sailors visit near Darwin

1451: Dutch documents record the journeys of Indigenous traders from Indonesia to Australia, or as they knew it to ‘Marege’

1500: Indonesian fishers visit northern Australia, which would last two centuries

1521: Some historians claim the Portuguese visited Australia during this time, which is what Mr Cropp is seeking to prove.

Feb/March 1606: The Dutch East India Company explored the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula. This is the first recorded landfall by a European on Australian soil. 

1616-1696: A range of English and Dutch explorers visited different parts of Australia. 

1770: Famed English Captain James Cook charted the continent’s east coast in 1770, which later opened the door to British colonisation. 

He told Daily Mail Australia: 'We have already done a lot of swimming and could not find the cannon that we were looking for. 

'IA lot more swimming needs to be done. If we find the cannon I am looking for we can date the period. 

'We had other clues, we have ballast rocks- they are the rocks you put in the ship to keep it steady in the water and when a ship is wrecked. We are also have the early maps.

'I am very excited about this trip, it's on my bucket list, I want to find the most important shipwreck in Australia. 

''It's likely there were three explorers between 1520 and 1525 that came to Australia but we need positive proof.' 

Mr Cropp is also on the lookout for other wrecks and said he was going to go back to previous sites he had discovered to check the dating because we could have been on a much older wreck. 

'I know the cannon is out there but it is going to be very hard to find. It takes a lot of searching and I am letting the world know this time. I thought I might as well because it is very important.'
