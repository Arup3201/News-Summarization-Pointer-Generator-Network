Reaching the end of an epic 2,000 mile railroad trek across the nation, Boeing 737 fuselage's strike imposing figures as they dwarf traffic and houses on their way to the airline giants Renton, Washington factory.

Having been built in Wichita, Kansas, the 100-foot fuselages are loaded onto freight trains to be transported over the Rocky mountains where they are assembled on a literal giant conveyor belt as part of the Boeing 737 Next Generation program.

The constant flow of the jets across the nation are to fill the near-insatiable demand for air-travel globally, matched by Boeing who declared late last year that they will increase the rate of 737 production at Renton to 47 jets a month by 2017 - more than 560 per year.

Conveyor: Boeing officially cranked the production rate of its 737 Next Generation plane to 42 per month, an all-time high and hopes to be building 47 a month by 2017

By 2017, Boeing and Airbus will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month. Both plane makers also are vying for a piece of the spare parts market, demanding royalties on parts that are sold directly to airlines and never enter their factories

Indeed, there is talk of the number of fuselages delivered by Spirit Aerosystems of Wichita, Kansas rising to as many as 60 a month by the end of the decade.

Speaking to the Seattle Times in June, Spirit CEO Jeff Turner said that it was conceivable and that his firm would strive to do so.

Freight trains carrying complete 737 fuselages from Spirit run from Wichita, through Stevens Pass, along the Seattle waterfront and straight into the Renton factory.

There are approximately 5,600 747's in service including, early 737's - which represents a quarter of the total worldwide fleet of large commercial jets flying

Across the world there are 331 airlines in 111 countries that are flying 737s

At any given second there are 2,000 737 planes in the air and one takes off or lands every 2 seconds

Across the model there are approximately 54,500 scheduled flights of 737s every day

Boeing 737s have carried more than 16.4 billion passengers - equivalent to every man and woman on earth flying at least twice

All Boeing 737s have flown more than 176.5 million flights since their launch

The steady increase rate is planned to match the introduction of the newest 737 model, the 737 MAX or Boeing 737 Next Generation.

It will be the third generation derivative of the 737 and will include 4 variations able to seat between 110 to 210 passengers.

The move is designed to keep up the staggering competition between Boeing and the European multinational conglomerate, Airbus and their A320 neo model.

Airbus last week said it will notch up production of its single-aisle A320 planes by nearly 10 percent, matching a similar move by Boeing. Both companies also are building many of their double-aisle plans at faster rates.

By 2017, Boeing and Airbus will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month.

Beverly
 Wyse, Boeingâ€™s 737 program vice president and general manager, said the
 move is aimed at meeting increased demand from airlines in an interview
 with the Seattle Times.

'Our
 employees and our suppliers have successfully increased the production 
rate to unmatched levels over the last three years,' said Wyse.

'This increase will lay a solid foundation as we bridge into production on the 737 MAX.'

However, Airbus has already declared that it is steadily overtaking Boeing.

While Boeing has just over 1,600 firm orders for the MAX, Airbus has more than 2,400 for the neo.

The
 Boeing 737 is the best-selling and longest continuously produced 
commercial airliner of all time with over 10,500 deliveries and orders.

With approximately 5,600 737s in service, 25% of the worldâ€™s large jet fleet are Boeing 737s.

And Renton is very much a part of that success with 40 percent of the world's entire jetliner fleet having been built at Renton.

Planes are technical marvels that operate with great precision and safety, but the flying public still demands fares that cost less than a good hotel room, and jet fuel costs are likely to remain high. So airlines are driving hard bargains to pay as little as possible for jets

Boeing is selling some jets more aggressively, since Airbus has gained 60 percent of the market for new single-aisle planes, a market that represents more than half of the new planes to be delivered over the next 20 years
