Typhoon Bolaven has left a trail of destruction this week in North and South Korea.

But in Eastern Russia it brought 'manna from heaven' with an unprecedented tidal wave of molluscs and crabs thrown up on the most popular beach in Vladivostok.

Locals said it was useless to throw them back in the sea - they just came ashore again.

Fishy feast: Russians flocked to the beaches of Lazurnaya Bay to scoop up the molluscs washed ashore by Typhoon Bolaven

'Manna from heaven': The beach was covered with a carpet of mussels, clams and crabs

'Now we know what 'manna from heaven' means,' wrote a local girl Svetlana in her blog.

'People
had nothing else to do but to collect them to cook for a free lunch - 
or take nice pictures with beautiful big crabs,' said the Siberian 
Times.

But as Russians 
swarmed onto the beaches of Lazurnaya Bay on the country's Pacific coast
to collect the teeming molluscs, the nearby Korean peninsula was 
counting the cost of the typhoon.Â 

It submerged houses and roads, 
ruining thousands of acres of crops and triggering landslides that 
buried train tracks, and was quickly followed by a second major storm, 
Typhoon Tembin.

The light-hearted scenes captured on the shores of Siberia were in stark contrast to the havoc wreaked by Typhoon Bolaven and later Typhoon Tembin in North and South Korea.

Reclusive North Korea was already
recovering from earlier floods that killed more than 170 people and 
destroyed thousands of homes.

That in turn followed a springtime drought that was the worst in a century in some areas.

Earlier Bolaven left 20 people dead or missing in South Korea and three are believed to have died in North Korea.

Some 3,300 were left homeless in the North, said reports.

There were fears for the spread of disease in the Communist state.
