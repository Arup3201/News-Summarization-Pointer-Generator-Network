A dog that lost the use of its back legs after she was stamped on as a stray puppy has been given a new lease of life after learning to walk in a wheelchair.

Ashley the chow chow mix had her back, pelvis and femurs broken by an angry homeowner in Florida when she was just six-months old.

The unidentified man flew into a fit of rage when he saw the homeless pup in his back yard and launched a violent attack on her as 'punishment', repeatedly stamping on her as she lay helplessly in the grass.

However, despite nearly dying from the terrifying ordeal and undertaking several painful operations, loveable chow mix, Ashley, has managed to get back on her feet through the use of a specially fitted wheelchair.

When Ashley came to Home for Life nine years ago (left) an angry homeowner repeatedly stamped on her for 'trespassing' on his property. She suffered a broken back, pelvis and femurs in the attack but thanks to her resilience, say her carers, she survived and is now happy (right)

Thanks to the generosity of local neighbours, Ashley was flown over 1500 miles from Florida to an animal sanctuary in Star Prairie, Wisconsin, that offers around the clock care when she was only six-months-old.

Run entirely by kind-hearted volunteers, Homes for Life gives the loveable pooch such home comforts as heated flooring, clean trousers that prevent her legs from getting sore and daily leg massages to help with her circulation.

But as the saying goes, you can never keep a good dog down and ten-year-old, Ashley, now spends most of her time running around large open meadows with her four other furry friends.

Leah O' Fallon from the Home for Life said: 'Ashley was in a very poor condition, she had her back broken, her pelvis crushed and her femurs broken.

'This occurred when, as a stray puppy, she wandered into a random man's yard, the man wanted to 'punish' her for trespassing, so he began to stomp on her.

'Ashley underwent many surgeries but because her back was broken she was instantly paralyzed in her back legs and there was no way to reconnect the severed nerves that connected her spine to her back half.

'Because she was a puppy when it happened, her constant growth made it difficult to keep up with surgeries, every time her legs grew, they had to be reset.

'Thankfully, his neighbours interceded and saved her, she did nearly die, but thanks to her tenacity, she's survived and thrived.

Wheelie easy: As soon as she was fully grown, she was fitted with a wheelchair and took to it right away. Now, she's not the only one in the sanctuary to be fitted with wheels to help her walk

'As soon as she was fully grown, she was fitted with a wheelchair, she took to it right away and now plays in the Home for Life meadows, greets visitors to the sanctuary, and chases her housemates.

'Ashley now lives in a house with five other dogs, the house is connected by doggie door to an outdoor run, so she and her housemates can go in or out whenever they please and the the inside has heated floors in the winter and air conditioning in the summer.

'There are also couches and dog beds filling the interior and the dogs she lives with are the most energetic of the bunch, she enjoys running outside with them and racing, even with her wheels.'

No action was taken against the unidentified man who attacked Ashley.
