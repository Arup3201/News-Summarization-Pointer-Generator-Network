The Church of England was plunged into a race row yesterday over the choice of the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

A leading supporter of the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, who is one of the favourites for the job, said his name had been ‘besmirched’ by opponents who had resorted to ‘naked racism’.

The allegation was levelled by the Reverend Arun Arora, a former member of Dr Sentamu’s staff, who is set to take up a prominent post in the Church’s national bureaucracy this summer.

Lord Carey of Canterbury, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, today hit out at the campaign against Dr Sentamu.

He told the Times: 'I am quite 
appalled. If there is a besmirching campaign then it is abhorrent and I,
for one, will challenge this.

'I think John Sentamu would be a wonderful choice for Canterbury. There are other people to consider, but he has a proven track record.'

He said that while other candidates 
for Lambeth Palace were being discussed in terms of their opinions and 
alliances, ‘it is only when Sentamu is mentioned that such 
considerations give way to explicit criticism – some of it attributable,
much of it anonymous whispering, but all of it in stark contrast to the
way other bishops are being portrayed’.

Mr Arora said some of the criticism 
has been ‘disturbing’, citing the supposed description of 62-year-old Dr
Sentamu by one Oxford don as ‘brutish’.

Mr
Arora said the use of the word was racist and added: ‘At its best the 
besmirching of John Sentamu has revealed that strand of snobbery which 
views outsiders as lacking class, diplomacy or civility – in other words
not one of us.

‘At worst 
it has elicited the naked racism which still bubbles under the surface 
in our society, and which is exposed when a black man is in line to 
break the chains of history.’

Mr
Arora, who is about to become the Church’s director of communications, 
ridiculed suggestions  that Dr Sentamu sometimes loses his temper.

The
row comes at a time when various lobbies inside the CofE are competing 
to get their own champion into Lambeth Palace.

Gay activists are hoping 
to find a figure potentially sympathetic to the cause of gay equality, 
while the liberal wing of the Church is anxious to maintain its own 
dominance over major appointments.

Two
of the last three Archbishops of Canterbury have been prominent 
liberals, and one of the current favourites, the Bishop of Norwich, the 
Right Reverend Graham James, was a member of the staff of one of them, 
the late Lord Runcie.

Dr 
Sentamu is not a favourite of CofE liberals, who do not like his firm 
line against gay marriage and his generally socially conservative 
stance.

Nor do they like his opposition to the Left-wing doctrine of 
multiculturalism, his championing of the virtues of Englishness, or his 
defence of the record of the British Empire.

Dr Williams, 61, announced last month that he was standing down as Archbishop of Canterbury, after ten years in the post.

He is to take up the role of Master of Magdalene College at Cambridge. His successor is expected to be named in late summer.
