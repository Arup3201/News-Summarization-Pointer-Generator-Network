An Army staff sergeant, described by a comrade as 'evil incarnate', severed the fingers from the bodies of three Afghan civilians but had nothing to
do with any plot to slaughter the unarmed men for sport, his lawyer said today.

A court martial opened for Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, 26, who
has pleaded not guilty to 16 criminal charges ranging from murder to taking the
fingers as bloody mementos.

The sergeant, from Billings, Montana,  has maintained that the three
killings early last year were legitimate engagements – and that his
co-defendants conspired to blame him when they got caught.

Gibbs' attorney, Phil Stackhouse, told jurors in his opening
statement: 'What you are seeing in this case is the ultimate betrayal of an
infantryman.'

However the lawyer admitted that Gibbs took fingers from
the victims. He noted that while it's inappropriate to take such trophies,
soldiers are taught to 'disassociate war casualties from the human being they
once were'.

In some of the most gruesome allegations to emerge from the Afghan war,
prosecutors say Gibbs and his co-defendants slaughtered the victims with
grenades and powerful machine guns during patrols in Kandahar province, then
dropped weapons near their bodies to make them appear to have been combatants.

Of the five soldiers charged as part of the so-called 'kill team'
within the platoon, three have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against
Gibbs, who faces up to life in prison without parole if convicted.

Gibbs, 26, is the highest-ranking of those charged. Others in the unit,
including some of his co-defendants, portrayed him as an imposing sociopath
with little respect for life – a man who gunned down dogs without provocation,
threatened fellow soldiers and who tallied his kills with skull tattoos on his
calves.

A prosecutor, Captain Dan Mazzone, told the jurors at Joint Base Lewis-McChord,
south of Seattle that Gibbs took advantage of weak leadership in the platoon to
lead his juniors into the diabolical plot.

This wouldn't be a case where they
have to second-guess difficult combat decisions, Captain Mazzone told them.

He said: 'This case is the exact opposite: It is about premeditated
murder.'

The crimes are among the most gruesome allegations to emerge from the Afghan
war.

Gibbs joined the unit in what was then known as the 5th Stryker Brigade in
Kandahar province in late 2009. He soon began telling others how easy it would
be to kill civilians, Mazzone said.

When the platoon later came across a body that had been mangled by a
helicopter gun, the prosecution said, Gibbs had reason to believe he'd really be able
to get away with murder.

As the platoon's leadership watched, one soldier
stabbed the corpse with a knife and posed for a photo.

Captain Mazzone added: 'This platoon is out of control. He sees weak
leaders, he sees an opportunity, he sees soldiers who are willing to cross the
line.'

Gibbs' lawyer sought to lay the blame for any unjustified killings with
Gibbs' comrades. When Gibbs came to the unit, hash smoking was already rampant,
Stackhouse said.

Gibbs, who had more combat experience than most of the others, did talk
frequently of previous shootings he'd been involved in – including one in Iraq,
when Gibbs fired on a car that refused to stop at a checkpoint, only to later
learn that the vehicle was carrying an innocent Iraqi family.

The others may have misinterpreted Gibbs' stories, according to Mr Stackhouse.

He said: 'On hash-filled nights, under a cloud of intoxication ... they'd talk
about these things.'

Gibbs is accused of a wide range of misconduct, from providing a grenade
used in January 2010 to kill the first victim, an unarmed farmer in a field in
Kandahar province, to directly shooting or tossing grenades at the next two in
February and May of that year.

One co-defendant, then-Cpl. Jeremy Morlock of
Wasilla, Alaska, said that he or Gibbs enlisted one other soldier to
participate in each of the three killings.

Asked why he took part in the killings Morlock, the first witness,
testified Monday that the unit had trained to be deployed to Iraq, and were
frustrated that at the last minute their orders were changed to Afghanistan.

Morlock said they wanted action and firefights but instead got meetings.

He added: 'It was a lot of meet-and-greets, shaking hands.'

Prosecutors said Gibbs also led a group of others in assaulting a soldier who
reported drug use in the unit, and that he threatened that same soldier with
fingers severed from the bodies of dead Afghans.

That soldier, Pfc. Justin
Stoner, ultimately prompted the war crimes investigation by telling
investigators who were looking into his beating that members of his platoon had
engaged in unjustified kills.

Stackhouse admitted that Gibbs took part in the beating to punish Private Stoner for
going outside the chain of command to report the drug use.

He said: 'Did he get roughed up? Yeah. Was he
brutalized? No.'

Gibbs and Morlock also paid Stoner a visit later to make sure he didn't
report the beating, Stackhouse said. Gibbs rolled out the severed fingers on a
cloth, and Morlock told Stoner not to wind up like those guys.

Stackhouse added: 'Is this shocking to Stoner? Stoner had seen the fingers before.'

Morlock has pleaded guilty in a deal for a 24-year sentence. Pfc. Andrew
Holmes of Boise, Idaho, admitted involvement in the first killing and was
sentenced to seven years.

Spc. Adam Winfield of Cape Coral, Florida, admitted
involvement in the third killing and was sentenced to three years.

Winfield had previously tried to blow the whistle on the plot by reporting
it to his family, who reported the allegations to Lewis-McChord after the first
killing.

The report went unheeded, and two more civilians were killed before the
defendants were arrested in May last year.

Winfield said he participated in the last
killing because he believed Gibbs might kill him if he didn't.

'He likes to kill things,' Winfield told investigators. 'He
is pretty much evil incarnate. I mean, I have never met a man who can go from
one minute joking around, then mindless killings.'

Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, who is charged with direct involvement in
the second killing, has a court martial scheduled for January.

Gibbs' trial is expected to last until Friday. The verdicts need not
be unanimous but four out of five jurors must agree to convict him.
