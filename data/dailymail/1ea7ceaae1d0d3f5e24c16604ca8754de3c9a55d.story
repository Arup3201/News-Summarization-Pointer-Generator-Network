As a qualified plumber, Rhys Webb is ready to throw the kitchen sink at the All Blacks this weekend. The scrum-half is also keen to patch up any leaks in the Welsh defence as he prepares to take on a New Zealand side he claims are ‘there to be taken’.

It is a bold statement from the 25-year-old half-back, particularly given the fact his country have failed to beat the Southern Hemisphere giants since 1953. But Wales are hoping to catch the Kiwis cold in their final game of the season, just as England did in 2012.

Webb is high on confidence after displacing long-term favourite Mike Phillips from the Welsh line-up and, having seen the All Blacks run close by Scotland and Australia, believes Wales have the key to unlock their interminable dominance.

‘They’re a world-class team who are top of the rankings at the moment,’ said Webb. ‘But I think they are there to be taken.

‘Australia nearly pipped them and Scotland put in a real tough performance against them. You’ve got to be physical. They’ve been getting a bit flustered when people have been going at them. I think if we can play our game plan, not take a backward step and really get into them then we can put on a good show.’

Having spent the early stages of his Ospreys career playing second fiddle to 81-cap All Black scrum-half Justin Marshall, Webb is familiar with the Kiwi ways. 

On Saturday he is expected to face 37-capper Aaron Smith and hopes that Marshall’s teachings will work in his favour at the Millennium Stadium.

‘At the Ospreys, learning off Justin was very special,’ said Webb. ‘Just the way he controls the game and his running side of the game as well. It’s not all about passing, passing, passing but the way he likes to take on defenders as well. 

'Obviously he was really good at closing out games. He could slow it down at vital times and keep an eye on the scoreboard and clock; managing the boys around him.’

As well as working in the shadows of Marshall, Webb has also been following in the footsteps of an impressive Brynteg Comprehensive alumnus. JPR Williams, Gavin Henson and Rob Howley are all former students from the Bridgend school, with the latter now in charge of the Welsh back-line.

Howley made 59 appearances in the red jersey and now works closely with Webb in his role as assistant to Warren Gatland. Both Howley and Gatland see the half-back combination of Webb and Dan Biggar as the best option to take Wales through to the World Cup, particularly given their impressive form for the Ospreys.

The Guinness PRO12 pair have developed an understanding at club level and are the latest half-back ‘unit’ to play together for their country. The pair have followed the likes of Nick Phipps and Bernard Foley (Waratahs and Australia), Will Genia and Quade Cooper (Reds and Australia) and Francois Hougaard and Handre Pollard (Bulls and South Africa).

‘We know each other inside out - the different options we have and knowing where he is,’ said Webb. ‘

'As a nine you need to know where the 10 is at all times and he’s obviously really vocal as well, which helps nine. He doesn’t shut up but that’s good for a nine, for directing forwards around us. He’s a really confident player as well - he’s full of confidence at the moment, which is good for Wales. Hopefully he can run a good show for Wales.’

Webb cites 81-cap All Black scrum-half Justin Marshall as a huge influence during his time at the Ospreys 

Webb endured a mixed afternoon in the opening defeat to Australia. He scored the opening try with a characteristic snipe from the breakdown, but was then caught out by Israel Folau, who intercepted his pass for an 80-metre run in.

Such moments of naivety will be punished against the All Blacks but Webb is no longer the one in the shadows. The shirt is his to lose and a solid performance on Saturday will surely see his stronghold through to the final Test against South Africa next week.

‘I know when you play in that jersey, it’s not permanent,’ said Webb. ‘I’ve been enjoying my rugby this year so I think that’s helped in selection. You need to put on a real performance to keep hold of the jersey but it means a lot to wear it this weekend against one of the best sides in the world. I remember watching Jonah Lomu scoring tries and running over people. It’s a dream come true.’
