It has become one of the worst kept secrets in technology - with everything from models to the real thing being spotted and posted online.

Now it appears one of Samsung's own ads has been leaked, revealing the two handsets the firm hope can topple the iPhone.

Samsung's Galaxy S6 is expected to appear in a radical Edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on Sunday, while the standard version looks like an iPhone 6.

A leaked Samsung advert reveals the two new Galaxy handsets, the S6 and the S6 Edge - which are not being officially announced until Sunday.

CNET Korea also revealed these images, which it claims show the final Galaxy S6 Edge.

Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display.

Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. 

It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera.

More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. 

The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides.

The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. 

And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge.  

Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March.

Both phones will be revealed at a special event in Barcelona before the Mobile World Congress begins there on Monday.

A 'verified employee' on Reddit called iamdenden posted the following teaser revealing the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, the latter with its curved display.

A series of photos from  CNET Korea also claims this is the official handset. 

The images were posted to the xda-developer website.

No other information about the handsets was posted.

Another user also posted pictures of the standard version of the handset on the same forum.

'Can't say where it's from but it's from AT&T directly,' the poster said. 

'Obviously a prototype or test model and it says not for sale on the package. 

'Obviously a phone, I was scared to play with it much but seems a glass back and front with metal on the sides.' 

'Our source, who has seen Samsung's new devices in person, tells us that the mid-level 64GB curved Galaxy S6 will cost carriers €949 ($1,076), with the top-end 128GB model priced at €1,049 ($1,189)—around €50 more expensive than the comparable iPhone 6 Plus.'

The same source also said the firm is having yield issues for the curved display, which could mean the handset is in very short supply when it launches.

Reports claim the ground breaking handset could be prohibitively expensive - and that Samsung is struggling to make the screen.

According to a source at one of Samsung's mobile carrier partners in Europe who spoke to Ars Technica under the condition of anonymity, Samsung is launching both the curved and normal Galaxy S6 at high price points.

The Standard version of Samsung's Galaxy S6, which will be revealed on Sunday.

The firm has been showing off the curved screen in teaser adverts, but is believed to be struggling to manufacture them in large quantities.

For the non-curved Galaxy S6, European pricing is €749 ($849), €849 ($963), and €949 ($1,076) for the 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB models respectively - $100 cheaper than the curved version.

The site warns that these high prices could dent the phone's popularity. 

'The pricing of both the normal and curved versions of the Galaxy S6, however—if carriers pass the price hike onto consumers—could be problematic unless the hardware is truly sensational.' 

Samsung is set to unveil the handset in Barcelona on March 1st. 

The Galaxy Edge will have curved screens on each side, and the Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple.

Created by designes Ivo Marić and Jermaine Smit, the new renders show both expected versions - a standard one and an 'Edge' with both sides having curved displays.

Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. 

The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. 

And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge. 

However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right-handed mode

Users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them.  

Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens.

The handsets are also set to include wireless charging capabilities.

And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in. 

Many current phones need specially-designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly, but Samsung's next-generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip.

In a blog post by Seho Park, principal engineer in Samsung Electronics' IT and mobile division wrote: '2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging.

The S6 is expected to look similar to Apple's iPhone 6 handset

It will also include a rumoured 20 megapixel camera

'With our upcoming Galaxy smartphones, users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before.'

The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. 

These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides.   

Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. 

This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers.

There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). 

Samsung is a member of all three groups. 

This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. 

However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features. 

 The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 already offers this feature - but the Lumia 920 runs on the Qi standard.

Samsung's next Galaxy phones are, however, expected to be the first to support multiple standards on a built-in chip. 

This means they will be more versatile to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as McDonalds and Starbucks.

It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology. 

Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. 

The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it.

The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts.

The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example.

Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year.

Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. 

The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply.

Samsung's invite (pictured) hints at a curved device and the firm is expected to announced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge

The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi.

He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third.  

Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart.

'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts.

In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions.

The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.
