Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government

Nick Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne.

Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government.

Her intervention comes as Lib Dems this week prepare to reaffirm their support for the tax – which is also backed by Labour – at their annual conference in Glasgow.

But Ms Pryce, who will attend the conference, dismisses the whole idea of a mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives.

In an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just waiting to be tapped’.

Ms Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble.

‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says.

The remarks came as Mr Clegg last night opened the Glasgow rally with a plea for party unity.

He sought to placate members over sharing power with David Cameron by branding the Tories the ‘fire at will’ party for wanting to cut workers’ rights.

But respected Lib Dem peer Tony 
Greaves accused Mr Clegg of trying to blackmail his party into sticking 
with Tory-inspired austerity measures in a crunch vote tomorrow.

The
Deputy Prime Minister will speak in a conference motion on the economy 
in a bid to ensure members do not oppose Coalition spending cuts.

But
Lord Greaves said: ‘Presumably they were frightened they were going to 
lose – but it’s blackmail. It’s turning the debate into a vote of 
confidence in the leader.’

Ex-husband: Pryce was married to former British Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne. The two were jailed in March after they falsely told police she had been driving when his car was caught by a speed camera

Unity: Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg called for party unity at the opening of today's conference

Vince Cable will tomorrow delight activists by vowing to crack down on ‘rotten’ company directors by beefing up the law.

The Business Secretary will unveil plans to make it easier to ban rogue directors from running firms.

He will also announce help for people to get compensation where they have suffered a financial loss from a director’s ‘reckless’ behaviour.

Mr Cable, left, said: ‘For too long, a small rotten core [of directors] has got away with a slap on the wrist, a ban from working in the industry or a time-limited ban.

I want to beef up the laws to ban them from running British companies.’
