The activist who heckled Michelle Obama vowed to stop being a ‘nice lesbian’ as part of her personal mission to get equal rights for gay people, MailOnline can reveal.

Ellen Sturtz said she that if there was a risk of being arrested then you could ‘count me in!’ in an online profile she wrote in August 2011 - having already been booked once for protesting.

MailOnline can also reveal that Miss Sturtz has been doing activism full-time since divorcing her rabbi wife and moving to the other side of the country.

Last year Miss Sturtz left the San Luis Obispo, California home she shared with Barbara Zacky and now lives in Washington, D.C.

Fighting back: Ellen Sturtz, who heckled First Lady Michelle Obama, vowed to take strong action for gay rights - even getting arrested - after splitting with her wife

The beginning: Michelle Obama was speaking at a DNC fundraiser on Tuesday when she was interrupted by a heckler

Taking action: She then stepped down from the 
platform and went right up to the heckler and had words before walking 
in the other direction and flashing her hand

The pair were once a wealthy power couple who were patrons of the arts but now friends fear they may ‘never be close again’ because of the split.

Miss Sturtz made her outburst on Tuesday night in front of 200 guests at the $10,000 a head fundraiser at the $6.9m home of lesbians Karen Dixon and Dr Nan Schaffer in Washington.

Interrupting the First Lady or the President is seen as a breach of protocol and is generally frowned upon.

Mrs Obama was obviously upset and lost her cool, telling Miss Sturtz to either shut up and let her talk or she would leave.

Miss Sturtz, 56, walked out to applause from the crowd.

Now it appears that her intervention was
the most high profile of many of Miss Sturtz's protests, which include 
turning up to a fundraiser for President Obama in Hollywood in 2011 to 
lambast him for not fulfilling his election promises.

In an online profile for a 2011 event
in Memphis she wrote on the website for GetEqual, the activism group 
she works with, Miss Sturtz said: ‘I bring a bit of sadness to Memphis 
from my father dying in his sleep last week, a desire to no longer be a 
nice lesbian, and an interest in figuring out how to best further full 
LGBT equality - and if that means getting arrested, count me in!’

Miss Sturtz was part of the anti-nuclear movement and helped organise the first Gay Pride festival in San Luis Obispo.

'I bring a bit of sadness to Memphis from my father dying in his sleep last week, a desire to no longer be a nice lesbian, and an interest in figuring out how to best further full LGBT equality - and if that means getting arrested, count me in!'

In 2011 she and others marched in Los Angeles with a giant dollar bill to protest the decision by the secretary of the Smithsonian museum to remove a controversial piece of art from a show.

A retired government regulator, Miss Sturtz has said that when she worked for San Luis Obispo County, it was ‘the most satisfying to push the envelope where not everyone always agreed with me.’

On her online biography she also 
wrote: ‘My first arrest took place on January 30th (2011) in Rancho 
Mirage (California) in front of the place the Koch Brothers and their 
billionaire friends were gathering.’

Her marriage to rabbi Miss Zacky, 61, ended when they divorced in January last year, according to public records.

Until
then they lived a fairy tale life as prominent members of the Jewish 
and LGBT communities in California and were well known art lovers too.

Artist Bonita Helmer did a site specific installation at their home in Malibu in 2007.

The
couple were donors to the film East LA Interchange, about migration 
changes in Los Angeles, and in 2005 they gave more than $10,000 to the 
Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, Pennsylvania.

The home where the heckling happened belongs to power couple Karen Dixon and Nan Schaffer, formerly of Chicago, who have hosted fundraisers for the Obamas in the past

They gave around $2,000 to the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Centre in 2010 and have vowed to match any $15,000 donation to Liberty Hill, a California education nonprofit.

In addition, they were also listed as patrons for an Elton John concert for the American Foundation for Equal Rights in January 2011.

Miss Zacky was ordained as a rabbi in 2009 and is involved in progressive groups such as Rabbis for Human Rights.

She is currently continuing her pastoral education at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Miss Sturtz’s former sister-in-law Laura, 60, said that the marriage had been ‘nourishing and loving’ but that it had come to an end, much to her regret.

She said: ‘ I don’t know if she and Barbara will be close again but I believe Ellen will find her soul mate’.

Losing her cool: The heckler said that the First Lady 'got up in her face'

Striking a deal: She offered the choice of her leaving or the heckler

With the crowd cheering for her, she headed back on stage to continue the talk on education

She added that Miss Sturtz had gotten into trouble in the past because of her ‘big mouth.’

She said: ‘This (heckling Mrs Obama) is exactly the kind of thing she would do. She is not afraid to speak her mind’.

Gay marriage in California was made legal between June and November 2008, which is when Miss Sturtz and Miss Zacky appear to have got married.

It is now the subject of a landmark Supreme Court ruling expected later this month which could overturn the ban and make it legal once more.

In another twist, Miss Sturtz claimed that she heckled Mrs Obama because she could ‘not stay silent any longer’.

But a post on her Twitter page suggests that this is not exactly the case.

On May 30, just five days earlier, she Tweeted: ‘Would be interested in discussing some bold LGBT activity in DC. Purposely cryptic’ and included her email address, suggesting that there was some planning involved and that others might have known what she was up to.

Miss Sturtz did not respond to emails or Tweets requesting comment.
