The mother of a 14-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who
weighed 28 pounds when she died has pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter
at a court in southwest Ohio.

Angela Norman, 42, of Dayton, Ohio, is accused of allowing
her daughter to die through neglect in the worst case of malnutrition the
county coroner had ever seen.

Makayla Norman was covered in bed sores and showed other
signs of neglect when she died on March 1, 2011, said court authorities.

Left to die: Makayla Norman had numerous bed sores and showed signs of massive malnutrition when she died on March 1, 2011, according to authorities

Mrs Norman pleaded guilty to a first-degree felony count of
involuntary manslaughter and to single misdemeanor and felony counts of
endangering children at Montgomery County Common Pleas Court in Dayton, north
of Cincinnati.

The county coroner's office attributed the teen's death to
nutritional and medical neglect complicated by her chronic condition.

'She
was the worst malnourished child this office has ever seen,' said Ken
Betz, director of the coroner's office.

Angela Norman was indicted on the three counts last
November.

Three nurses who authorities said were to administer or monitor the
girl's care also were charged.

Norman remained in jail with bail set at $250,000.
Her attorney did not immediately return a call to his office.

Prosecutor Mat Heck Jr. said  that Angela Norman did
not provide sufficient food or proper care for the child, resulting in her
death.

The two felony counts were related to Makayla Norman's
death.

The misdemeanor count of endangering children involved another daughter,
the prosecutor said.

Mollie E. Parsons, 42, of Dayton (left) and Kathryn Williams, 42, have both been charged in connection with Makayla’s death

Norman had been scheduled for trial April 18 with the other
three defendants who have pleaded not guilty in the case.

Mollie E. Parsons, 42, of Dayton, is charged with
involuntary manslaughter, failing to provide for a functionally impaired person
and tampering with records.

Kathryn Williams, 42, of Englewood, and Mary K. Kilby, 63,
of Miamisburg, both registered nurses, are each charged with failing to provide
for a functionally impaired person and failing to report child abuse or
neglect.

The teen was confined to her home and was supposed to be
cared for by her mother and Parsons, a licensed practical nurse who was
supposed work six days a week at the home, according to the prosecutor.

Williams was paid to supervise Parsons, visit and inspect
the living conditions, and do a physical assessment of the girl every 30 to 60
days.

Kilby was scheduled to visit every six months to also check
on conditions of the home and assess the girl's health, needs and care, the
prosecutor has said.

An agreement has not yet been reached on a specific
sentence for Norman. Sentencing is set for April 24.
