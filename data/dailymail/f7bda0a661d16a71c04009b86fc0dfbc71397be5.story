Bestselling novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford today paid tribute to Baroness Thatcher, saying she was a 'rock star' who 'saved Britain' and became the greatest peacetime Prime Minister of the modern era.

The author of A Woman of Substance described a run-in she had with the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, as she was admiring a painting of Winston Churchill.

Mrs Bradford told Mrs Thatcher: 'As a little girl growing up, I could never have imagined that one day I would come to Number 10 and stand here looking at the portrait of Winston Churchill.'

The Prime Minister replied: 'I know what you mean, Mrs Bradford - neither did I.'

'Feminine': The author described Lady Thatcher as 'tough, but in an elegant way' and praised her dress sense

The acclaimed writer is one of hundreds of public figures to share their memories of Lady Thatcher since her death on Monday at the age of 87.

The great Prime Minister's ceremonial funeral will be held at St Paul's Cathedral next Wednesday, and the Queen will be among the guests.

Mrs Bradford, 79, told MailOnline: 'She was a star... today they would call her a rock star! I rather think she was exactly that.'

As well as praising the political instincts of Britain's first female leader, Mrs Bradford paid tribute to her 'female practicality and common sense'.

She said: 'I think she was tough, but in an elegant way. She was one of the most feminine women I have ever met.

'She loved clothes, shoes handbags and jewellery. Iâ€™ve always admired her for that, and for owning up to it. Power in a lovely dress... A Woman Of Substance indeed.'

The author was introduced to Mrs Thatcher by Irwin Bellow, the chairman of Leeds City Council who helped forge the Prime Minister's signature policy of selling off council houses.

He arranged for Mrs Bradford and her husband Robert to attend a cocktail party at Number 10 for leading figures in the arts.

Number 10: Lady Thatcher with David Cameron at Downing Street, where she once chatted to Mrs Bradford

'I recall being at the end of a long reception room, talking to a small group of people, when I noticed I was facing an open door,' she told MailOnline. 'I stepped to one side, and caught a glimpse of an oil painting of my great hero, Winston Churchill.

'Edging away from the group, I went and peeped around the door. This opened onto a small landing, and hanging over a downward-spiralling staircase was that huge portrait of the great man.

'A moment later I heard that inimitable voice, asking cordially, "Are you all right, Mrs Bradford?"

'I swung around to face Margaret Thatcher. "I am, thank you, Prime Minister," I said. "I was just standing here, thinking that as a little girl growing up I could never have imagined that one day I would come to Number 10 and stand here looking at the portrait of Winston Churchill."

'"I know what you mean, Mrs Bradford - neither did I," she answered me with a twinkle in her eyes. As we walked back into the reception, she told me how much she had enjoyed my book, and I congratulated her on being the first woman to become Prime Minister.'

Mrs Bradford, who was awarded the OBE in 2007, added: 'Like Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher saved Britain in the postwar years, just as Churchill had saved the country in the Second World War - not to mention western civilisation as well.

'Sir Winston had a state funeral, and so should she. She certainly deserves it and should be honoured in this way.'

Mrs Bradford's books have sold around 90million copies worldwide, with her first novel A Woman of Substance, published in 1979, by far her biggest hit.

Her new novel, Secrets from the Past, was recently published by HarperCollins.
