Three Muslim men accused of plotting to behead a member of the public days before Remembrance Sunday laughed yesterday as they appeared in court for the first time.

Haseeb Hamayoon, 27, and cousins Nadir Sayed, 21, and Yousaf Syed, 19, smirked and giggled in the dock as prosecutors claimed they planned to carry out an atrocity on the streets of Britain.

They were arrested days before Remembrance Sunday after police discovered their alleged knife plot.

The timing of the arrests created fears of a Remembrance Day outrage and resulted in a massive security operation in Whitehall as the Queen led events at the Cenotaph to commemorate the anniversary of the start of the First World War. 

All three men were driven to Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London yesterday afternoon

Yesterday, the alleged plotters appeared under heavy guard at Westminster Magistrates’ Court after being charged with intending to commit acts of terrorism just hours earlier.

Traffic was halted as they were brought to court in two armoured prison vans escorted by three unmarked police cars.

The two bearded cousins stood defiantly with their arms crossed on being told to sit down by chief magistrate District Judge Michael Snow, nudging each other and laughing as the alleged beheading plot was outlined.

Hamayoon sat throughout the hearing, nodding and waving at two older family members in the public gallery.

The three men spoke only to confirm their names and addresses during the 25-minute hearing.

They were charged under the Terrorism Act 2006 with intending to commit acts of terrorism and being jointly engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect to their intention. Prosecutor Rebecca Mundy said: ‘These are serious charges, the evidence of which has been set out in a lengthy case summary.

The charges came a week after police were granted a further seven days to question the suspects, and a fortnight after they were first arrested

‘In relation to that this appears to be an incident where there was an attack planned in the UK that seemed to be imminent in nature and would have involved the defendants acting together in beheading a member of the public, using knives to do so.’

Police and security services were on high alert up to and during Remembrance Sunday amid concerns that the Queen herself may have been a target.

But the 88-year-old monarch defied the heightened terror threat to lay the first wreath at the Cenotaph, prompting crowds who normally watch her depart in solemn, respectful silence to break into spontaneous applause.

Lawyers for Sayed, from Hounslow, West London, Syed, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and Hamayoon, from Hayes, West London, said they would not apply for bail. All three were remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on December 4.

Armed police swooped on the gang on November 6, arresting the youngest at the home he shared with his mother in High Wycombe. Hamayoon was stopped at gunpoint in his car in Southall, West London.

A fourth man arrested in Uxbridge at the same time was released on November 15.

Police have made a series of arrests since the UK’s international terrorism threat level was raised to the second-highest rating of ‘severe’ in August, meaning an attack is considered highly likely.

There are concerns that British jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq will return to carry out acts of terrorism in their home country.

Islamic State leaders have also called on so-called ‘self-starter’ followers to target high-profile commemorative events.

The Army has already increased security in and around Whitehall following the fatal shooting of a soldier at a war memorial in Canada several weeks ago.
