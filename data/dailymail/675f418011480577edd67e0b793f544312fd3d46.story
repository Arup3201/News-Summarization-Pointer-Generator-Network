GoPro cameras are known for being inconspicuous, which means they can be easily hidden to capture up-close footage of animal.

But this camera ended up far too close for comfort when a bald eagle swooped on it and snatched it into the sky.

As the camera carried on filming the bird of prey found a quiet place to land and inspect its find - even managing to capture a selfie. 

The bald eagle was originally being filmed eating fish heads by Arkansas photographer Mason Colby, before it decided to swoop down and steal the camera.

Instead of viewing the bald eagle eating we get a far more personal viewpoint of the lie of an eagle as he whisks it through the sky.

As the bird lands it even manages to captures some shots of its face as it investigates what it has found.

Flight: A few seconds into the video a number of bald eagles fly into frame and one of them steals the GoPro

Mr Colby said the bald eagle carried the camera for up to a mile before the bird went out of view.

After an intensive four hour search in the rain Mr Colby said he was relieved when he eventually found the electronic device.

The camera was still intact after it was discovered and the footage offers a fascinating insight into the bald eagle's movement.
