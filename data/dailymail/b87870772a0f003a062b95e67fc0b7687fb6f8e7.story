Victim: Craig Taylor, pictured, was found dead on Sunday morning after an altercation late Saturday night

An American man has been found dead on the side of a road in Cancun after he reportedly got into a fight over the bill at a nearby gay bar.

Craig Taylor was found dead early Sunday after reportedly getting into a fight the night before.

Craig, 22, was traveling with his brother and two friends and arrived in the resort town on Friday February 28.

The next night, the group went to a local gay bar called 11:11.

It is unclear exactly what happened 
that evening but multiple local reports claim that the group got into a 
dispute with the bar employees over their bill.

They reportedly claimed that the bill was too high and then may have accused the waitress of taking their credit card. 

One report says that Criag's brother and friends fled the scene but his body was not found until the following morning.

He was found strangled to death.

 newspaper reports that investigators were able to link him to the 
dispute at 11:11 because he was wearing a wristband that proved he had 
entered the establishment.

Six people have been arrested in connection to the incident, though none have been charged with murder.

Five
 of the suspects- Javier Pérez Solís, Juan Antonio 'Tony' Quiroz Ortiz, 
Noel 'Lilo' Vargas Gómez, Walter Berner Rock Neighborhoods, and Jesus 
Adolfo Ruiz Alvarez- worked at the bar as was owner Claudia Leticia 
Lopez Castro.

There were conflicting initial reports 
about the victim's identity, but MailOnline confirmed with the American Embassy in Mexico City that the dead American's name was Craig Taylor.

Taylor is a Kissimmee, Florida native.

Mourning: Online tributes have been posted by friends of Craig, including this photo that shows him with his friend Sasha Gabrielle who wrote 'Thank you for always being honest and making me laugh'

Connection: Investigators were able to place Taylor at the bar, called 11:11 (pictured), because he was wearing a wristband that they give out for entry

Despite initial reports to the contrary, Taylor was not a student at the time of his death.

Craig’s body has been released to his brother, whose name has not yet been announced.
