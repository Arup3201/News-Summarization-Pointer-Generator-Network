Middle school students were left traumatized after police officers burst into their classroom in the middle of the day with their guns drawn during an unannounced 'shooter drill.'

The police officers from Winter haven, Florida carried out the exercise to see how well students at Jewett Middle Academy would cope if a crazed gunman entered their school.

But the stunt left parents, students and teachers furious as no one knew that it was going to take place ahead of time - except for the school's principal.

Texts: Frightened students began sending desperate texts to their parents because they thought they might die

Frightened students began sending desperate text messages to their parents because they thought that they might die.

Their worried parents were only told about the drill by e-mail after it had taken place. 

Lauren Marionneaux, a seventh-grade student at Jewett Middle Academy, said it was about 9 a.m. Thursday when the principal announced the school was going on lockdown.

Students huddled into classrooms waiting for further instructions and heard voices in the hallway.

‘A lot of people started getting scared because we thought it was a real drill,’ Marionneaux told Fox 13. ‘We actually thought that someone was going to come in there and kill us.’

Two police officers then burst into Marionneaux's classroom with their guns drawn -- one carrying, what Winter Haven police said, was an AR-15 rifle.

Another officer had  his duty firearm – a handgun – drawn and worryingly, it was  loaded, as required. 

The seventh grader said she panicked and sent a text to her mother, Stacy Ray, who was scared out of her mind because she too thought that the drill was real.

She said: ‘I'm panicking because I'm thinking that it's a legitimate shooter [that] is coming, that something bad is happening at the school.’ 

Ray also received frightened text messages from her other children, including one that read, ‘I thought he was going to shoot me.’  

But Winter Haven Police Chief Charlie Bird said that the surprise element of the drill was  what officers had planned.

Bird told WTVT: 'It’s very important that, when you do your drill, you do it without everyone knowing that it’s a drill.

‘How you train and how you prepare is how you’re going to react when everything goes bad.’

He added: ‘It really is to protect the children and at no point in time would we endanger any of the children.’   

Despite this, Ray and other parents feel it was extreme for police to have their guns drawn on kids.

She added: ‘It's very scary, especially from a parent's perspective. You hear all this horrible stuff on the news and you think it might be happening at your child's school.’

Jason Geary, a spokesperson for Polk County Schools confirmed that it was standard procedure for these types of drills to take place without advanced warning to parents, students or teachers. 

Changes are being implemented in the wake of the devastating  Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, in Newtown Connecticut, when Adam Lanza shot 20 kids and six teachers.

States — including Tenessee, New Jersey and Missouri — will be carrying out active shooter drills in schools. Several businesses are also said to be adopting the tactic to train staff.
