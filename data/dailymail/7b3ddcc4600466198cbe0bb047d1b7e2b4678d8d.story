Angi Fiege believes that her beautiful 19-year-old daughter, Rachael, would have been alive today had her friends bothered to call for help after she fell down the stairs during an alcohol-fuelled party last summer.

Speaking to seniors at her daughter's high school this week, Angi Fiege said Rachael's college friends at Indiana University looked out for her, 'but they looked out for her the wrong way.'

The 19-year-old college freshman passed away last August from a severe head injury a week before she was to start school.

Tragic: Rachael Fiege, 19, moved to 
Indiana University in August 2013 and was set to start class in a week when she sustained a head injury during a house party where alcohol was served and died

Off-campus: This is the house, just a block from the edge of the Indiana University campus, where Miss Fiege fell down a flight of basement stairs and died

Rachael Fiege was likely drinking at an off-campus event when she slipped and fell down a flight of stairs. Other party-goers thought the girl was drunk and left her to sleep it off on a sofa, but she never woke up.

By the time paramedics were called more than six hours later, the teenager's heart had stopped.

'I know she'd be alive if they called 911,' Mrs Fiege said, referring to her daughter's friends, according to Indianapolis Star. 

Nine months after the tragedy, Angi Fiege is speaking out for the first time about her daughter's passing.

The married mother of two, who works as an ER doctor in Indianapolis, recalled the terrible moment she got the call about Rachael and rushed to the hospital.

‘I saw my baby lying on the bed, on the ventilator, unconscious, with all the signs of lifelessness, except for a pulse,’ she told the station WTHR.

Regret: Rachael's best friend, Mary Baluyut, says she left the August 2013 party 15 minutes before the teen's deadly accident

Rachael's best friend, Mary Baluyut, went to the fateful party with the freshman but left 15 minutes before her accident because she had an early meeting the following day. In retrospect, the young woman has come to regret her decision.

‘I really believe that had somebody recognized this was a serious event and called for help right away, my daughter would be here and we wouldn't be having this conversation,’ Angi Fiege said.

In the aftermath of the girl's untimely death, Rachael's family and friends launched a new program called Rachael's First Week to educate high school seniors about some of the risks they might face in college.

On Friday, Rachael's loved ones accompanied by IU emergency medicine residents met with 430 graduating seniors at Zionsvlle High School.

‘When you go out, you have to watch out for yourself,’ Ball State student Hanna Elliott, 19, told the high school kids in the audience. ‘You don't have your Zionsville bubble anymore.

‘Don't let us scare you. We want you guys to live it up, have fun — and be careful.’

As part of the presentation, the seniors were shown a video featuring highlights from Rachael’s painfully short life set to Beyonce’s ‘I was here,’ followed by a Q & A session.

Angi Fiege, Rachael’s friends on stage and many of the seniors in the crowd sobbed and wiped their eyes as the vivacious 19-year-old girl smiled at them on the screen.

‘Maybe highlighting what happened to Rachael, because she was so well-known, attaching a face and a name to those experiences will hopefully help prevent those tragedies that happened to my daughter,’ Mrs Fiege said.

The overarching message that the team behind Rachael’s First Week wanted the seniors to take away from Friday’s event was: watch out for yourself, don't leave your friends behind and help one another.

‘Quite frankly, what happened to Rachael could happen to anybody. It was an accident,’ her mother pointed out. ‘They need to know what to do if they get into situations like this and not to be scared and to call for help, because seconds do count.’

Terrible choice: Miss Fiege was taken off life support by her parents, pictured, after a doctor told them that she was brain dead and would not recover from her injuries

The group used Friday’s program to promote Indiana's Lifeline Law, which provides immunity for minors who had been drinking if they seek medical help for a person suffering from an alcohol-related emergency.   

Angi said that while it is difficult to watch the presentation, she knows that it could potentially make the difference between life and death for some college freshman. The goal is to make sure Rachael's first week is never repeated.

After the gathering, Zionsville seniors received a card with some helpful safety tips and a medallion honoring Rachael’s legacy. The Fiege family are planning to expand the initiative to schools across the state.

At the time, police in Bloomington said Rachael Fiege fell down the basement stairs at an off-campus house and passed out sometime between 1 and 2am on August 24, 2013.

Her fellow students helped her up, but did not call an ambulance until nearly 8am - seven hours later, because they didn't realize she was badly injured and thought she had just passed out.

Fiege's tragic death came just two days after she arrived at Indiana University and before she had a chance to even attend her first class.

The campus newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, reported that her parents took her off life support just hours later after doctors advised them that she was brain dead. 

Miss Fiege, who hoped to be a nurse, moved on campus August 21. The following night, she attended a boozy party at a house just one block from the edge of campus. 

After she tumbled down the stairs in the basement of the home, students helped her up and had her lay down in a different part of the house about 2am.

'The thought initially was probably that the injury was not as serious as it was,' IU Police Chief Laury Flint told the Daily Student at the time.

It was not until 7.45am Miss Fiege's fellow students realized she would not wake up and called authorities.
