Ched Evan's mother Helen Roberts has praised Judy Finnigan after the TV presenter made controversial comments that the footballer's rape was not 'violent'

The mother of Ched Evans eagerly backed Judy Finnigan’s ‘level-headed’ claim that his offence was ‘not violent’.

Helen Roberts, who has consistently defended her son’s name, also took to Twitter to highlight vitriolic comments by other users about Evans’ victim.

Mrs Roberts posted a remark on Twitter on Monday, which appeared to be deleted later, praising Miss Finnigan and criticising her fellow Loose Women presenter Ruth Langsford.

She wrote: ‘Judy Finnigan thank you for being level-headed and not joining the hysteria. Ruth Langsford was trying to achieve. She was totally biased #chedevans.’

She also retweeted comments likely to be seen as questioning whether the ordeal of Evans’ victim – who suffered vicious slurs on social media following the former Sheffield United footballer’s conviction – actually constituted rape.

One user whose comments Mrs Roberts quoted several times on her Twitter account is a female Sheffield United supporter, who wrote: ‘[The victim] didn’t suffer, she said she couldn’t remember. 

'This is so frustrating.’

She retweeted a comment from another user, which said: ‘[Judy Finnigan] has got it right #JusticeForChed. Many men in prison after joint night of pleasure.’

Earlier in the week, Mrs Roberts had directed her anger at women’s rights campaigner Jean Hatchet, who set up the online petition calling for Evans to be barred from returning to football when he is released from prison.

Mrs Roberts wrote: ‘So a non-existent “woman” has got thousands of people to sign a petition against something that she read in the paper might happen #getalife.’

Later Mrs Roberts wrote: ‘She hates men until she needs them to sign her false petition. Sign as long as you don’t look at her.’

She also highlighted an attack on the campaigner by another Twitter user, which said: ‘When you lose sight of real feminism and become a man-hater like Hatchet, you become the oppressor you once fought against.’

Another comment retweeted by Mrs Roberts seemed to show support for her belief that her son’s conviction was wrong, saying: ‘Wow, apart from Ruth, the panellists were so level-headed. Shame they weren’t on the jury!’

A Sheffield United fan commented: ‘Massive respect to Judy Finnigan for giving her genuine opinion on the Ched Evans case #JusticeForChed’

Later Mrs Roberts posted: ‘There is nothing better to keep you going then receiving support and kind words from people that you have never met. #appreciated.’

Some Twitter users called for Miss Finnigan to be fired, but ITV said she will still appear on the show next week.

Yesterday Mrs Roberts declined to comment at her £250,000 detached house in the seaside town of Rhyl in North Wales.
