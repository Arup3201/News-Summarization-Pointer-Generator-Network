Snared: Roki Aprisdianto escaped jail in a burka but was caught after taking veil off in front of bus of police

A convicted terrorist who escaped from prison wearing a body-covering Islamic burka was immediately arrested on a bus when he took the veil off – because many of the other passengers happened to be anti-terrorist police.

Roki Aprisdianto was serving six years in jail on the Indonesian island of Java when he made his get-away after a group of burka-clad women came to visit their husbands.

Under the flowing robes, he walked out of the prison with the women, undetected by officers, and laid low for a few weeks in the east Java town of Madiun.

According to police, when the heat 
died down he put the burka back on and made his way to the local bus 
station where he purchased a ticket to travel to the town of Solo.

Once
seated on the bus, and certain that his escape plot had been a total 
success, he removed the headgear part of the gown, revealing his male 
features.

Unfortunately
for Aprisdianto, a large number of Indonesia’s anti-terror squad were 
travelling on the bus – and the escaper was immediately arrested.

‘He made what you might call a big 
mistake,’ said national police spokesman Major General Suhardi Alius.

‘He took his veil off because he thought he was safe and it was his bad 
luck that police were travelling on the same bus.’

It is not known what happened to the 
woman who passed the burka to Aprisdianto, but police believe she was 
probably wearing a second burka, which she slipped off before leaving 
the jail with the other women who were similarly dressed.

Aprisdianto was sentenced to six years behind bars in 2011 for masterminding a series of bombings.

Two other militants believed to be part of his group were captured in Solo town a short time after his re-arrest. A third, believed to be the group’s fundraiser, was arrested a day later.

The three told police they had helped Aprisdianto prepare a bomb that was planted at a police station after he had escaped from prison - the device failed to explode.

Aprisdianto is now facing many more years in prison – wearing custom-made shorts and a T-shirt.
