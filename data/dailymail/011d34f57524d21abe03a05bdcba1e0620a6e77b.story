If you get dizzy at the top of tall buildings, spare a thought for Laura Taylor.

The 22-year-old from Essex no doubt experienced more than just the head-rush of vertigo when her brave boyfriend sprung her with a marriage proposal 800ft above London at the top of the newly-opened Shard.

Miss Taylor was with her boyfriend James Episcopou, also 22 and from Essex, at the official opening of the Shard's observation deck on level 72, when her beau got down on one knee and surprised her.

Moments earlier, Mayor Boris Johnson cut the ribbon to welcome visitors to the highest vantage point in western Europe - 800ft (244m) above London.

Undaunted by the world's media and the Mayor of London watching him, Mr Episcopou dropped to one knee beside the glass wall and asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage... and was rewarded for his bravery when Miss Taylor said yes.

The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital.

After the event, Mr Episcopou, a supervisor at John Lewis, said he had no idea that Boris Johnson and a media pack would be on the observation deck at the same time.

He said: 'I've had it planned since July last year. When tickets first came out I thought I've got to buy them, it's the perfect place to propose.

'Laura means everything to me and I wanted to make her feel on top of the world.

'We had no idea the media were going to be there, but when we arrived we saw Boris Johnson and there were cameras everywhere.'

When asked if the presence of the media made him even more nervous, he replied: "There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to do it.

'For Laura it's made the day even more special. When people plan a proposal they think, "how can I make it special?". I managed to do quite a good job.'

Miss Taylor, a 22-year-old accountant, said: 'I had no idea he had planned it. I thought we were going up to look at the view.

'James asked me to come over to him because some photographers would like to take our picture. The next moment he was on one knee and proposing. I was so shocked. I said "yes, definitely", but then I was speechless.'

Mr Johnson described London's tallest building as 'a most amazing place'. He said: 'I don't think there's anything in London like this.

'It's the closest thing to being in an airplane and looking down on London. But you can walk around, you've got complete stability.

'You can see all the bends in the river, you can see my office, you can see Buckingham Palace, you can see the whole thing for 40 miles around.'

The Shard's architect, Renzo Piano, added: 'This building is magic for a number of reasons.

'First, because it's in London, second, because it's so tall, and third, because this building is a part of London. It's a sense of London.

'It's sad when London is sad, it's joyful when London is brilliant and joyful.'

On a clear day, visitors to the Shard, which towers over the city at a height of 1,016ft, are promised a spectacular view of the capital.

But visibility was restricted for the dignitaries, journalists and members of the public attending the launch because of wet and cloudy weather.

Some 4,800 people paid for admission today - at £24.95 for adults and £18.95 for children.

Terry Quelch and his wife Merill travelled from Bristol to be among the first to experience the new attraction.

Mr Quelch, 69, said: 'It's great looking down and seeing all the landmarks. I do like the shape of the building, the way it spikes up like an icicle in reverse.'

His wife, 65, said: 'London hasn't had anything like this since the Eye. I think it's brilliant.'

On a clear day, visitors will be able to enjoy a 360-degree view of the capital's skyline, from a platform almost twice the height of any other in the city.

With the help of specially designed telescopes, they should be able to pick out London's landmarks in the streets below.

Visitors to the attraction - on floors 68, 69 and 72 - are whisked up in two high-speed lifts in around 60 seconds.

Irvine Sellar, chairman of Sellar Property and developer of the Shard, said: 'I think Londoners will feel ownership of the Shard. They'll adopt it as the Parisians adopted the Eiffel Tower or the Americans adopted the Empire State.

'I think we need a new landmark building, something that stands out.'

Anders Nyberg, chief executive of The View from The Shard, claimed it offered a unique experience.

'You're seeing a tapestry of history,' he said.

'We're in a 21st century tower, right across the river from an 11th century tower, the Tower of London. Nowhere else in the world can you get that kind of perspective.'
