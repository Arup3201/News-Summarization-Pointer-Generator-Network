Only in Test cricket could a batsman face 55 balls without scoring a single run yet still come desperately close to becoming the hero before having his moment of glory cruelly snatched away with just one delivery remaining.

Such was the fate of Jimmy Anderson in an extraordinary finish to the second Test at Headingley on Tuesday night as Sri Lanka claimed their historic first series victory in England despite a dramatic rearguard that so nearly denied them.

Anderson, the man who held firm in Cardiff five years ago to deny Australia, repelled everything Sri Lanka threw at him in a last wicket stand with Moeen Ali that seemingly earned a draw that had long appeared out of England’s reach.

Yet just as it seemed all the hard work had been done, just as it appeared that England would get out of a huge hole of their own making, Shaminda Eranga had the final glorious word for Sri Lanka.

A ball short: Anderson was dismissed on the penultimate delivery of the match

Just as the first Test had gone down 
to the final ball before the match was drawn this one lasted until 
7.07pm and the penultimate ball of the final over before this Investec 
series finally swung decisively in Sri Lanka’s favour.

Anderson,
 who had joined the mighty Moeen with 122 balls remaining and the Test 
all but lost, was barely troubled until Eranga delivered a short pitched
 brute of a delivery that Anderson could only fend off gently to Rangana
 Herath.

The leader of 
England’s attack held his head and sank to his knees, just as Stuart 
Broad had done when he could not force a victory at Lord’s, and was in 
tears afterwards at the post-match presentation. He could have done no 
more.

England had come 
so, so close to becoming the first side to bat through the final day of a
 Test having begun it five wickets down but ultimately had to face up to
 the harsh reality of losing an early summer series for the first ever 
time.

This was a 
heart-wrenching way to sink to a defeat but the way England held out so 
doggedly for so long will only increase their sense of frustration at a 
Test and a series they simply threw away.

Ten
 chances in all were squandered in this match by England who also wasted
 a position of dominance with the bat in the first innings and then 
crashed to 57 for five on the penultimate evening when chasing a 
theoretical 357.

Understated: Moeen Ali doesn't even remove his helmet in celebration of his maiden Test century as he pushed to save the match for England

Job to do: Moeen simply raised his bat and was congratulated by James Anderson after reaching the milestone

Padded away: Anderson shows no interest in scoring lasting more than 50 without getting off the mark

Under pressure: Tailender Anderson is crowded by Sri Lanka fielders as they fought for the final wicket

Their 
gallant failure should not be allowed to mask those shortcomings and the
 grim reality that they have suffered a massive setback in their quest 
to start afresh after the winter horrors of Australia.

Yet when the 
dust settles on what should be recognised as a significant triumph for 
Sri Lanka, England will take huge consolation in the performances of the
 new players who have all made an impact throughout two long, hard 
Tests.

None more so than Moeen, who was simply brilliant in scoring 
his maiden Test century in the most difficult of circumstances and 
displayed both a calmness and pure elegance of strokes that mark him out
 as a new star of English cricket.

It was hard to believe that Moeen 
was playing in just his second Test, such was the maturity and skill 
with which he marshalled the England defence throughout the final day 
and so nearly towards a joyous conclusion.

Chat: Root and Herath exchange words during play on day five at Headingley

Any concerns that he may 
not be good enough to be a specialist spinner – and he is a much better 
bowler than even England seem to realise – should be shelved. This 
impressive character is good enough as a batsman alone.

A sparse 
crowd of barely 2,000 here at Headingley turned up more in hope than 
expectation as Moeen joined Joe Root at the start of the final day with 
seemingly only the full extent of England’s humiliation to be decided.

And
 it quickly became clear that the bad feeling between these sides that 
began with the reporting of Sachithra Senanayake for throwing had 
reached boiling point, with Sri Lanka taking their verbal attack on Root
 to the limits.

When Nuwan Pradeep finally found a way past Root Sri 
Lankan joy knew no bounds but there was to be more controversy in the 
form of two no balls, one that was given and one that was not before the
 Test was eventually settled.

Firstly, when Matt Prior was bounced 
out, a technological check on Dhammika Prasad’s front foot found him 
perilously close to being in front of the line. TV umpire Paul Reiffel 
gave the benefit of the doubt to the bowler, a novel twist on an old 
cricketing tradition introduced in their wisdom by the ICC.

Nearly there: Spinner Herath and Sri Lanka celebrate the wicket of Chris Jordan (L), England's eighth to fall

Yet when 
Chris Jordan was caught off Eranga an apparently identical foot position
 this time led to a no ball call and a reprieve for the batsman. 
Confused? Address all your inquiries to a Mr D Richardson of the ICC in 
Dubai.

Jordan did not hang around to take advantage of his let-off 
and when Stuart Broad was trapped by Hearth the ball after refusing a 
single England’s fate looked complete. Yet there was so nearly a final 
barely believable twist.

Alastair Cook will have gone through every 
emotion over two contrasting final days of this series but this will 
have increased his resolve to silence the doubters by fighting on 
against India, starting at Trent Bridge on July 9.

He has seen his 
side lose this series despite three batsmen in Moeen, Sam Robson and 
Gary Ballance all scoring their maiden hundreds in only their second 
Test and Liam Plunkett return to Test cricket with a nine-wicket haul 
here.

There is promise for England but there is also the harsh 
reality that the captain needs both runs and victories and he needs them
 very quickly.
