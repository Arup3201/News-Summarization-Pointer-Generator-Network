First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU

Scotland will have to make a new application to join the European Union if voters back independence, a Foreign Office minister warned today.

Hugo Swire told MPs that ‘everything would change’ if Scots vote to go it alone in the referendum due in autumn 2014.

An independent Scotland would not automatically be a member of the EU and would have to ‘start afresh’, he added.

The comments are the strongest from a government minister on the issue of Scotland’s status in the EU, which has become the focus of early skirmishes in the independence debate.

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond was ridiculed after claiming in a TV interview that he had obtained legal advice on EU membership but it had to remain secret. He later admitted no advice had been sought.

In a debate in Westminster Hall today, Mr Swire said it was ‘only an assertion’ that an independent Scotland would simply continue in membership of the EU.

The Scottish independence referendum is being held in autumn 2014, when Mr Salmond hopes to capitalise on a patriotic mood marking 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn

He added: ‘The UK has managed to 
negotiate, over the years, exemptions from membership of the euro and 
from the Schengen common visa area, ensuring that the UK can maintain 
control over its own monetary and border policies.  

“But
the fact is that if Scotland became independent, everything would 
change.  Independence is not simply an extension of the devolution 
arrangements that have worked so well.

Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said Scotland would have to 'start afresh' if voters back independence

‘It
is not merely a further point on the constitutional continuum.  It is a
fundamental change – a definitive split from the rest of the UK, an 
irreversible step.  Independence would bring devolution to an end.’

If Scotland backed independence, England, Northern Ireland and Wales would continue the international legal personality of the UK.

‘Scotland, having decided to leave the UK, would start afresh.  The overwhelming weight of international legal precedent underscores this point.  

‘The most likely scenario by far is that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new state, involving negotiation with the rest of the UK and other Member States, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. ‘

Further analysis will be published by the UK government next year.

Earlier SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed Scotland would be able to remain in the EU. ‘We remain members of the EU because the UK took us into the European Union in 1973.

‘When Scotland secures its independence, the Act of Union will fall and there will be two successor states. Whatever happens to an independent Scotland will happen to the rest of the United Kingdom - that's what happened in Czechoslovakia.’
