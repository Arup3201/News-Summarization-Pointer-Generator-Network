A New Jersey cop under scrutiny for shooting an unarmed man in December has been hit with a $25million lawsuit alleging he forced a woman to repeatedly have sex with him after he caught her shoplifting.

Shakera Brown says Bridgeton Officer Braheme Days detained her after she was reported shoplifting in January 2014.

He allegedly told the 22-year-old: 'There are two ways we can handle this: I can take you to jail, or we can handle this in an adult manner.'

For the next 11 months, Days repeatedly harassed Brown to perform sex acts on him and have sex with him in his patrol car, according to the lawsuit, reported by the South Jersey Times.

During each encounter, Days threatened her with jail if she didn't comply, she says.

Days is already under investigation after he and his partner shot dead Jerame Reid during a December 30 traffic stop. Dashcam video form the patrol car shows Reid step out of the vehicle with his hands in front of him when Days and Officer Roger Worley open fire.

Reid, a convicted felon, reportedly had a gun in the car, but was unarmed when he was gunned down by the officers. Days and Worley fired nine times, the newspaper reports.  

Days has nine complaints against him following his hiring in 2012 - though all of them were dismissed for 'lack of probable cause,' according to the Times. 

The police department, the city of Bridgeton and Days all declined to comment about the lawsuit to the Times. 

Court records show that Brown has a history of shoplifting arrests, the Times reports. She was caught by Days in January 2014 in the parking lot of a Rite Aid pharmacy. 

According to the lawsuit, Days gave her an ultimatum - she would be cuffed and carted off the jail or they could 'work something out.'

Brown says she acquiesced and gave Days her phone number. The next day, he called her and demanded that she walk to his waiting patrol car. 

Days then allegedly demanded that she perform a sex act on him. When Brown told him she didn't want to - he told her that he'd take her to jail if she didn't do what he said, according to the lawsuit. Brown said she reluctantly agreed.

Shortly after the first encounter, Days allegedly gave Brown a prepaid cell phone and harassed her repeatedly for sex on a daily basis. 

Every time Brown resisted, Days threatened to arrest her and take her to jail, according to the lawsuit. 

Brown is demanding $25million in damages from Days, the police department and the city of Bridgeton.
