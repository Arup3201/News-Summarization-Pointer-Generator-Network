Vladimir Putin enjoys posing bare-chested on horseback and with hunting rifles to  perpetuate his macho image.

In Britain, however, our leader has shown his  Russian counterpart how a real action man does it. This was David Cameron yesterday as he got a full soaking during a race along a  swollen icy stream in the Cotswolds.

The Prime Minister sported a support  bandage on his right knee as he took part in the fund-raising competition close to his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire.

Anything you can do Mr Putin... David Cameron braved muddy conditions and cold water in the Chadlington Brook Run

Feat: David Cameron took part in the Great Brook Run on Thursday afternoon

Tough: The Prime Minister was forced to climb through a low tunnel as part of the annual race

Success: Mr Cameron posed with his wife Samantha after receiving a medal for completing the race

The Great Brook Run requires 
competitors to cover a course just over a mile long, and this year 
involved considerably more water than usual thanks to recent heavy rain.

The stream close to the village of 
Chadlington, known as the Great Brook, was raging so much this year that
children normally allowed to compete were barred from wading through 
some sections.

Cut: The Prime Minister's knee support did not stop him sustaining a nasty-looking graze on his shin

Ready to go: Mr Cameron rubbed his hands in anticipation at the start line of the race

Victory! The exhausted politician was still happy to pose for photographs at the end of the race

Support: Well-wishers cheered on the Prime Minister as they took pictures of his exploits

Hilarity: The fun race is intended as a charity fund-raiser and ends at a local pub

Mr Cameron, however, was able to secure plenty of 
photographs of himself  taming the torrent.

The Prime Minister finished 46th out 
of a field of 109 (a few places behind a man dressed as Father 
Christmas) with a time of 18 minutes, 23 seconds.

He was greeted by wife Samantha at the
end of the run at the Tite Inn. After asking his wife if she had any 
money he announced he was  planning to have a burger to celebrate.

At the end of the race, Mr Cameron was presented with the medal that is given to all competitors.

The Great Brook Run, which was first held in 2006, starts and ends at the Tite Inn in Chadlington and aims to raise funds for local good causes.

This year, the £5 entry fee was donated to the Chadlington Memorial Hall.

Mr Cameron may have been the most famous competitor in this year's race, but he was not the only well-known runner - Olympic medallist hockey player Beth Storry was also invited to run in the race.

Joining in: This is the third time Mr Cameron has taken part in the Great Brook Run

Evasive action: The race may not be very long, but runners must brave a cold and muddy stream

Laid-back: He may be the most powerful man in the country, but Mr Cameron sported casual lycra and a pair of shorts nonetheless

Tired out: The Prime Minister relaxed with a fellow competitor after reaching the finishing line

Ice cold: Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin swims in a cold lake during a vacation in southern Siberia
