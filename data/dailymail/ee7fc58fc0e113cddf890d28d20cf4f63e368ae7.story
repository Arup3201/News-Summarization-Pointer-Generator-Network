Laying on the ground amid the wreckage of the Boston Marathon bombings, Sydney Corcoran knew  she faced a long road to recovery.

The 18-year-old's femoral artery had been severed and if it wasn't for the kindhearted strangers that fought to save her she would have bled to death.

And having been given that second chance at life, the teen is wasting no time. Just weeks after the blast, she last night stepped out for her high school prom and was promptly named Lowell High School's Prom Queen.

Queen of the dance: Sydney's femoral artery had been severed by the bomb and her legs were shredded - but she made it to her ball

Flashbacks: The teen still suffers memories of the day she and her mother nearly died but last night her focus could be entirely on prom

'I keep feeling like I'm going to cry cause I'm just happy to be back,' Corcoran wearing her crown and sash told Today.

'See now I'm going to start crying! It's just really good to see everyone.'

Fellow students were clearly moved by the bravery of their classmate who went from marathon bystander to victim of terror in a matter of seconds.

She was at the sidelines with her mother, watching her aunt finish the race when the two bombs went off.

Her mother Celeste had to have both her legs amputated below the knee while Sydney's legs were shredded and severely damage but were lucky enough to be saved.

The teen's world was turned upside down by those events and she has spent weeks in hospital recovering alongside her hairdresser mom.

But the brave pair were determined that Sydney complete her high school rite of passage despite what they were contending with.

'When I was in the hospital, I didn't
 think this was going to be possible and I got to the rehab and, because
 I was up and I was doing stuff, it felt more like I could do it. And it
 was a goal,' she said.

'She still wanted to help out and she was determined to, so she made sure that she did my toes.'

One particularly difficult moment the teen faced was returning to her mom's salon.

The shop is in Boston's city center and brought back memories of what happened that day.

'Each time I go in it's scary. The first time, the entire car ride — I just had like flashbacks,' she said.

But once she was prepped for the big 
night nothing stood in her way and friends, including her boyfriend and 
date Tyler Veiga, ensured she had a good time despite the fact she's 
still on crutches and is in constant pain.

The 18-year-old was reunited with classmates to attend her prom, just six weeks after she was badly injured

Despite her foot being numb and having to use crutches, she was thrilled to attend

'It means so much to me, and it's not
 just in the United States, there's people all over the world that have 
reached out to me,” she said.

'See? I'm going to start crying. It’s so touching to me.'

The Lowell High School student is set to attend community college this autumn.

'There's some tough days and yesterday I had kind of a down day, but you just get through those days and you just power on, and the next day is another day, and it is prom day. So you can't be sad on prom day,' the teenager told MyFoxBoston.com.

After the devastating blast, the Corcoran family received nearly $500,000 in donations from strangers across the world to help pay for the cost of their medical care and rehabilitation.

It was another horrifying incident for the family as Sydney cheated death in 2011 when she survived a car accident which left her with a fractured skull.

Guidance counselor and family friend Shelby Boisvert told NECN.com that  the event was a majopr milestone for the Corcoran family.

'It’s been a long journey for her and I can’t even imagine what they’ve gone through, but for her this was like her crowning moment,  she really wanted to be here.'

Though dancing what still too difficult for the senior last night, she has one other goal in mind.

She intends to walk to the podium for her high school graduation.
