A Pennsylvania man on the run after shooting dead two young brothers during a drug deal has been arrested for raping a 13-year-old girl.

John J. Gonce, 28, of Secane, was charged with killing Christopher Malcolm, 17, and Rohan Bennett, 12, in Philadelphia on July 24 but evaded police and convinced his cousin to let him hide out at her Baltimore, Maryland, home.

Three days later he raped a 13-year-old girl and went on to sexually assault her on another two occasions, police said.

Gonce was arrested outside the cousin's home on August 7, after initially bolting from police and hiding in a rubbish bin.

The man was also wanted for a home invasion, where he tied up the owner of the apartment he broke into with electrical cord and threatened him as he searched for cash.

Baltimore County police charged Gonce with three counts of second-degree rape and three of second-degree sexual assault.

'He raped and sexually assaulted this girl on three separate occasions,' police spokesman Elise Armacost told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

He is being held without bail at the Baltimore County Detention Center in Towson.

'The current plan is for him to stand trial on the rape charges here before extradition to Pennsylvania (to face the murder charges),' Armacost said.

Gonce and two others were accused of gunning down the brothers during a drug deal gone wrong on July 24.

The boys' parents were later arrested on drug charges.

After the arrest, he fled Philadelphia, seeking refuge with his cousin on July 28. While in Baltimore, he allegedly raped the young girl on July 31, August 2 and August 6.

According to records submitted to Maryland District Court, Gonce admitted the assaults but claimed the child consented to the sex acts.

This isn't the first time the 28-year-old has been behind bars. He was released in January after a stint in a Pennsylvania prison for burglary and drug charges.

'He is someone we are glad to get off the street,' Armacost told The Baltimore Sun.
