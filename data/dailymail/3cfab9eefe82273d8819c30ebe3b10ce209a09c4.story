Locals and tourists have expressed outrage after a seaplane pilot was caught peeing into a regional city's water supply.

Tourist Nicole Atkinson was on holiday at the Awoonga Dam in Gladstone, in central Queensland when she took photos of the Australia By Seaplane pilot urinating in the dam.

The dam supplies water to Gladstone, which has a population of more than 30,000, as well as the nearby town of Calliope.

Ms Atkinson labelled the man a 'grub' and sent the pictures to the local council and community watch as well as sharing them on social media.

'PLEASE SHARE AND SHAME!! While I was visiting Gladstone QLD we were at Awoonga Dam taking pics when I realized I had taken a photo of a man standing on his water plane PISSING IN THE DRINKING WATER,' she wrote on her Facebook page.

Australia by Seaplane chief pilot Vance Krahenbring said he had launched an internal company investigation, and added the pilot would be disciplined, the Gladstone Observer reported.

Gladstone Area Water Board chief executive Jim Grayson said the incident would not cause any health issues for the town.

'We think it's poor behaviour but it poses no risk from a point of view of health,' Mr Grayson told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's not great behaviour and we certainly would discourage people from doing that and to use some self-control.'

The dam is the main water supply for Gladstone, which has a population of more than 30,000, as well as the nearby town of Calliope

Mr Grayson added the dam was 'very big' so the urine would be diluted and said the water is treated before it is sent to council.

'Raw water out there is treated through a process that removes particles and adds chemicals and produces water that is fit for human consumption and is tested quite extensively,' he said.

Lake Awoonga Caravan Park manager Jan Lawlor said there were public toilets the man could have used.

'It's disrespectful to everybody else in the public, basically,' Ms Lawlor told Daily Mail Australia.

But Ms Lawlor said she did not think he needed to be disciplined.

'I think he's going to have been embarrassed enough to be honest with you,' she said.

The Awoonga Dam is used recreationally for swimming, water sports and fishing.
