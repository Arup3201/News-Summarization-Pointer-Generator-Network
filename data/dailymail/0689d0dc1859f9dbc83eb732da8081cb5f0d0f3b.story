A remarkable photography exhibition has revealed 300,000 images of every object an artist has touched with his right hand for the past 12 years.

Italian Alberto Frigo's series 'Images of the artifacts used by the main right hand' comprehensively documents the thousands of everyday objects he has used for more than a decade.

Photos included in the Lifelogging exhibition show hairbrushes, toothbrushes, drinks, food, reading glasses and more.

Alberto Frigo's exhibition comprises thousands of small photographs displayed on separate panels

Other everyday objects used include drink bottles (left) and an electric shaver (right)

Many of the photographs show him simply eating - here he is pictured left holding a spoon. Right, he photographs himself holding a kaleidoscope

The 35-year-old Sweden-based artist used a small digital camera to record all objects he came into contact with in what he calls a 'DNA code for other humans to interpret'.

He explained: 'The panels show the objects I have used with my right hand since the 24th of September 2003.

'Each panel represents a month, each line a day, and each individual photograph an object.

'Each of these objects is like the letter of an alphabet representing my activities as a kind of DNA code for other humans to interpret.'

He estimated he touches about 75 objects per day, and intends to continue the project until his retirement in 2040, Yahoo reported. 

Alberto Frigo previously attempted to use a finger-mounted camera system where the camera sat permanently attached to his hand (pictured)

Thousands of photographs simply document food or the utensils he uses to eat

Mr Frigo's exhibition is composed of many panels displaying the photograph in strands which he calls a type of 'DNA'

It was when he started studying in Vancouver and became 'fascinated' by all that he was learning - such as making his own food, his laundry and the other jobs his mother once took care of - that the project began.

He said: 'It was about at this time that I tried to figure out a way to record my life without all the post editing and technological frustrations.

‘A day later I was photographing every object my right hand uses in order to keep track of my activities.

‘I then thought of the objects I was using as the letters of an alphabet which could, in the long run, make up a sort of DNA code of my life. I was 24 then and still eager to discover new exciting things in life.’

He has become so accustomed to the project that his left hand now almost naturally photographs his right hand without him even thinking about it, and he abides by the rule that every object the dominant hand uses is photographed once while being used.

His exhibition is currently on display at the Science Gallery in Dublin.

Unsurprisingly, photographs of Mr Frigo eating are common throughout the 12-year-long project 

The exhibition is also broken down into dates, providing a remarkable timeline of everything he touches
