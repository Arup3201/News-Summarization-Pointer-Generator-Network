Police searching for missing teenager Alice Gross have seized more CCTV footage than they did during the aftermath of the London riots

Police hunting for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross have started searching the National Trust-owned estate where Batman was filmed - two miles from where she was last seen.

Scotland Yard officers are combing Osterley Park, a Georgian country house and estate in west London, for the first time.

The estate is around two miles from where the 14-year-old was last seen on CCTV cameras as she walked across Brentford Lock on the Grand Union Canal.

The 16th century mansion was used as the residence for the fictional superhero in the Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises, starring Christian Bale. 

It has been exactly a month since Alice failed to return home to her family, sparking the Metropolitan Police’s biggest search operation since the 7/7 bombings. 

More than 300 officers from over a dozen police forces across the country are involved in the increasingly desperate hunt, which has even called on the assistance of the RAF who helped to identify possible new search sites.

And a stretch of the Grand Union Canal, which Alice walked alongside before she disappeared, was sifted through in the hope to recover her possessions, including her iPhone, but officers again drew a blank.

On Sunday, hundreds of the ribbons were handed to runners at the Ealing Half Marathon in a bid to spread the word.

Police searching for the missing teenager  have seized more CCTV footage than they did during the aftermath of the London riots, officers have confirmed.

Evidence from around 300 different cameras is being studied in the search for the 14-year-old, who disappeared on Thursday, August 28.  

It comes after a businessman whose cameras look out onto the area, said police missed the chance to view his CCTV footage because it is stored for only 13 days. 

David O’Neil, director of Contrast UK Shopfront Shutters, near where Alice was last seen, said it was a ‘cock-up’.

A Met Police spokesman said officers did not request the footage as they felt they had everything they needed. 

He added: 'CCTV is a valuable part of any investigation.

The estate is around two miles from where the 14-year-old was last seen on CCTV cameras as she walked across Brentford Lock on the Grand Union Canal

'We do not seize all CCTV; we target that which is relevant and likely to be of value to the investigation.

'From the images we have released of when Alice was last seen on CCTV it is evident that the quality is poor and so it does not allow us to identify other people. 

'Detectives have been able to identify Alice because of her very distinctive walk.

'To date detectives trying to find Alice have seized more terabytes of CCTV than Operation Withern, the Met's investigation after the 2011 London riots. This continues to increase as the investigation progresses.'

Osterley Park is around two miles from where the 14-year-old was last seen on CCTV cameras as she walked across Brentford Lock on the Grand Union Canal, and near to the previous search area of Elthorne Park

Officers drained a stretch of a canal on Sunday in the hunt for Alice's missing possessions.

Police spent hours sifting through mud and debris after receiving ‘specific intelligence’ that some of her belongings could be found there.

They are desperate to recover the 14-year-old’s iPhone, which lost its signal an hour before she was due home. 

The move came as the sister of prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, 41, said he could use his military training to live rough for weeks. 

The jobbing builder has not been seen since Alice’s disappearance grabbed headlines nationwide.

Dozens of officers spent the weekend scouring the open land around where Alice was last seen alive, with RAF aircraft carrying high-definition cameras and thermal imaging equipment overhead.

More than a month since Alice vanished police took the dramatic step of draining a 200-yard stretch of the Grand Union Canal, near her home in Hanwell, west London. They are desperately trying to find clues as to the fate of the schoolgirl and the location of the man suspected of playing a role in her disappearance.

Prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, 41, went missing days after Alice disappeared

Zalkalns, who lived in Ealing with his girlfriend and their baby daughter, went missing himself seven days later. He was captured on the same CCTV camera as Alice, cycling in the same direction. 

But his location remains a mystery – he does not have his passport and has not used his mobile phone or accessed his bank account.

Zalkalns was jailed for seven years in Latvia after stabbing his 22-year-old wife Rudite in the heart and burying her body more than 17 years ago.

The killer even managed to convince police and his wife’s family that she was missing when he had in fact lured her to her death.

Zalkalns’ statement reveals he made a knife to kill his wife and hid it in a remote forest.

 ‘I took her to a place in the forest that I knew,’ he wrote. 

‘I asked her to wait and went to get the metal bar and the knife.

‘I took the metal bar and beat her a few times on the head.

' She fell down on her back and I got the knife. 

'Then I cut her clothes and then ... I stabbed her once in the heart.’ 

His sister, Jolanta Daksa, said Zalkalns – a former member of the Latvian home guard – is ‘more than capable of surviving outdoors for weeks’.

She said he had been consumed by guilt after killing his wife and would have contacted his family to tell them he had not harmed Alice.

 ‘I think he has killed himself,’ she added.

Police are still working through 150 tip-offs they received after staging a reconstruction of Alice’s disappearance last week and reviewing material from 300 CCTV cameras.
