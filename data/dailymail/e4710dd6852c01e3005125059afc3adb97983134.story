The Croatian Football Federation has confirmed it will be looking into claims that Manchester City's Seko Fofana was racially abused during an elite development squad match against HNK Rijeka on Tuesday.

City's EDS coach Patrick Vieira took his players off the pitch as Fofana alleged that he had been targeted by Rijeka players after being sent off in the friendly and it is not yet clear what action the Barclays Premier League champions will take next.

In a statement issued to Sportsmail, the CFF revealed it is investigating the matter, despite Ranko Buketa, who was in charge of the Rijeka team on Tuesday, wholly denying the claims made by the City teenager.

Making his point: Patrick Vieira insisted City's players left the field after the alleged incident

'Croatian Football Federation is in a 
process of gathering information regarding the alleged incident and if 
there are any decisions to be made we'll make it public on our website,'
 the statement read.

'CFF 
follows a strong "no racism" policy so we take all accusations of racism
 very seriously. Fight against racism (and any sort of discrimination) 
is one of the key components of our president Davor Suker's programme 
and that is why we will have a good look into this matter.'

Buketa
 alleged that Vieira had an ulterior motive for taking his side off 
following Fofana's red card on the stroke of half-time but, with CFF 
confirming its own investigation, UEFA may now also take a look at the 
incident - the latest in a number of racial discrimination cases 
involving Manchester City.
