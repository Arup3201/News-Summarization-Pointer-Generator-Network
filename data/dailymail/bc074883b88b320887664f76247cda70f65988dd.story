This is the scene of devastation that faced motorists today after a caravan overturned and disintegrated across a busy motorway.

Pictures show the four-berth caravan smashed to pieces on the M6 with debris strewn across all three lanes of the carriageway.

The crash happened between junctions T6 and T7 on the southbound side of the M6 Toll, near Cannock, Staffordshire, shortly after 1pm.

The caravan was left almost completely flattened after it was involved in the accident shortly after 1pm

Highways officers spent an hour picking up the owner's belongings which were strewn across the road

Incredibly, no-one was injured when the caravan overturned and split open, showering the road with broken fibreglass and shattered belongings.

Central Motorways Police said the southbound carriageway was closed for an hour while officers cleared the motorway of debris.

A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said earlier today: 'We have been called to the M6 Toll to junction T6 to T7. We have one ambulance in attendance at present.

'It looks as though a caravan has overturned but fortunately there have been no injuries.'

Incredibly, despite the scenes of carnage, no one was injured in the crash, which caused long tailbacks

Motorists who later drove past the crash scene said it looked like a bomb had gone off

Debris from the scene was loaded onto a lorry and what was left of the caravan was towed away by police

Witness Andrew Howell, 45, an IT worker from Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I went past shortly after it happened and it looked like a bomb had gone off.

'It was more like down-town Gaza than the M6 in the Midlands. It just shows how dangerous caravans can be.'

Motorists took to Twitter to warn other drivers to avoid the area. Christina Savvas tweeted: 'This looks like a scene from a movie. Thankfully nobody hurt #M6TOLL #TRAFFIC'

And Alex Bergh added: 'You know your day's not going well when you're stood on the M6 toll and hundreds of people are out of their cars.'

Photos taken by witnesses show cushions, furniture and other belongings strewn across the carriageway

The crash closed the road for over an hour, causing huge tailbacks as traffic ground to a standstill
