Juventus have enquired about the availability of Monaco striker Radamel Falcao, according to Italian publication La Gazzetta Sportiva.

The Colombian has been a target of Real Madrid this summer, but manager Carlo Ancelotti insists his business is done this summer.

And with the Old Lady considering selling Fernando Llorente to Valencia, they could swoop in for Falcao.

Heading for Juventus? La Gazzetta Sportiva's back page on Sunday

On the lookout: Radamel Falcao has been linked with a loan move away from Monaco all summer

The paper does claim, however, that Juve are looking for double the £8m price they have been offered so far.

Falcao's signature wouldn't come cheap. He is thought to only be available on loan, and even that would demand hefty wages.

The news comes after Ancelotti spoke about Real Madrid's transfer dealings.

'It's done,' the former AC Milan and Chelsea boss stated. 'We're not looking to make any more signings.'
