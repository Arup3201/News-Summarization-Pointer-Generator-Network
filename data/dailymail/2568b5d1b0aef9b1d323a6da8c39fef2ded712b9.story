Tim Krul was brought on in the last minute of extra-time JUST for the penalty shootout

Newcastle goalkeeper saved two of five spot-kicks to send Holland through

Tim Krul distracted Costa Rica’s penalty-takers by telling them he already knew which direction their kick was going in – but it appears he had another technique to influence his opponents.

For video footage of the shootout shows Krul deliberately walking to one side of his goal before four of the five penalties, diving to the opposite corner once the effort was taken.

And on each occasion the Holland goalkeeper guessed right, saving from Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana to send the Dutch into the semi-finals.

Krul had only been brought on as replacement for Jasper Cillessen in the 120th minute of the goalless draw in Salvador.

Louis van Gaal has been praised for the psychological advantage the introduction of Krul gave his men.

But the substitute played his own part, as he revealed: ‘I watched them [Costa Rica] against Greece and studied them and I told the players that I knew where they were going to shoot to make them a bit nervous.

‘Maybe it worked. It happened before when I played against Frank Lampard. I told him that I knew and I saved it. I just tried that again. I’m so happy it worked.’

But did Krul’s pre-penalty routine tempt the Costa Ricans into picking their corner?
