Parliamentary computers are being used to view hardcore pornography featuring sadomasochism and foot and fat fetishism.

The X-rated websites have been accessed more than 2,500 times on computers used by MPs, peers and their staff.

Gay cruising websites have also been visited a further 3,500 times along with obscure erotica sites – including one showing naked women posing with cats.

Asked for an explanation, a  parliamentary spokesman claimed the sites may have been visited accidentally.

The Mail on Sunday obtained the information through a Freedom of Information enquiry. It covers a 14-month period between May 2011 and July 2012.

The visits are a breach of parliamentary IT rules, which bar online ‘pornography’, ‘nudity’  and ‘adult/mature content’.

It follows the revelation in this newspaper earlier this month that parliamentary computers were used to click thousands of times on a website that encourages adulterous affairs.

Harry Potter, a barrister specialising in obscenity cases, said: ‘Having viewed the material, it does not in my opinion fall foul of the law as constituting extreme pornography. It is, however, undoubtedly hardcore pornography.’ A variety of foot fetish websites – which include pornographic images of lurid sex acts involving feet – have been viewed 470 times.

Another website featuring an array of pictures of naked women lying next to cats has been viewed 17 times.

A Polish pornography website was accessed 292 times in May 2011. In the same month a dating website was clicked on 653 times. The website boasts it is ‘dedicated to connecting fun-loving singles across the UK’.

The Parliament IT firewall is supposed to block ‘personals/dating’ websites. However, in addition to the 2,549 clicks on porn sites, gay cruising websites have been visited 3,459 times.

Shamed: The Mail On Sunday's exclusive report revealed that Out Of Town Affairs, a website that brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months on Parliament computers

A gay dating website was accessed 2,828 times in May 2011. The website states it provides a ‘platform for the gay and bisexual male and transgender community’. Another website that allows users to pick which MPs have  ‘the most sex-appeal’ has been clicked on 12,371 times.

A sex-toy shopping website was also visited.

Earlier this month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Out Of Town Affairs, a website that brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months on Parliament computers.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many people working in Parliament are spending far too much time surfing websites that have nothing to do with their jobs. What’s more, this evidence suggests codes of conduct are being breached.

‘It is vital that taxpayers are able to scrutinise how time they are paying for is spent and that anyone caught breaking the rules is appropriately punished.’

A Parliament spokeswoman said it was possible the sites were visited accidentally. She said: ‘A user may access a site that contains optional or automatic links to another which are recorded without active connection.

‘But where there is trustworthy evidence that an employee has breached the acceptable use policy, it is treated as an issue subject to disciplinary procedures.

‘However, direct employees of Parliament are not the only users of the parliamentary network.’
