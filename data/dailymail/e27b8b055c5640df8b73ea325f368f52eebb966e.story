A young man’s life has been saved by a new drug after he was struck down by the blood cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma for the second time.

Student Martin Solomon, 20, desperately needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant and was told he had just weeks to live unless a donor was found.

His heartbroken family searched the world for a match without success because of his mixed Irish and Afro-Caribbean heritage.

Student, Martin Solomon, 20, desperately needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant because he had blood cancer. He was told he had just weeks to live unless a donor was found

Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand even asked his Twitter followers to join the bone marrow donor register to see if they could save his life.

Time was running out for the Manchester University student and a donor had not been found so he was approved for a new treatment which has only recently become available in the UK.

He has amazed doctors at Manchester’s Christie Hospital by beating the disease in just a few months thanks to the Brentuximab Vedotin.

It meant Mr Solomon’s own white blood cells - which were harvested then put back in his body - were able to beat the cancer.

Martin is now in remission, and doctors have told him that he could be well enough to return to university in September.

His family, from Sale Moor, Manchester, started the Match4Martin campaign last year, when it was believed a bone marrow transplant was his only chance of survival.

Mr Solomon is now recovering after being treated with a new drug. He is pictured (centre) with L to R: His sister Serena, 29, father Martin, 49, mother Paula, 48, and sister Zea, 23

His parents have vowed to continue the campaign to find a donor just in case Martin’s cancer ever returns.

His mother, Paula, said: ‘Compared to how things were at the end of last year, we have gone from the depths of despair to complete euphoria that Martin is still with us. We just thank God for cancer research and drug trials.’

Mr Solomon said: ‘I can’t wait to get back to normal - I’m just so relieved.

‘We’ll continue searching for a bone marrow donor for me but I am hoping to go to Croatia for a holiday with all my friends this summer and I’d like to go back to university as well.’

His father, Martin Senior, added: ‘We’ll be taking each day as it comes but plan to throw him a massive barbecue party for his 21st in July.’

Stephen Cannon, honorary consultant at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital and specialist in orthopaedic oncology, said it is too early to call the new medication a 'wonder drug', but that results are promising.

He said: 'It's early days - the drug has only been about for a year and a half -  and I don't have any personal experience of it.

'But results have been positive. More research needs to be done to check that there aren't any serious side-effects, but so far it looks promising.'

Expert says it's too early to say if it's a 'wonder drug' - it has only been in existence for a year and a half - but it is having very positive results
