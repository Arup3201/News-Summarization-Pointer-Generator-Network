A hospital has been shut to patients after finding traces of the potentially deadly bacteria in its water system that can lead to Legionnaires’ Disease.

St George’s Hospital, in Hornchurch, Essex, has closed its two wards containing 44 patients following the discovery of the bacteria during routine water testing.

The decision was taken by North East London NHS Foundation Trust.No fresh admissions were being made today, but other services were staying open - subject to an ongoing review, a spokesman said.

Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia contracted by breathing in small droplets of water contaminated with legionella bacteria. It can be fatal if left untreated but isn't contagious.

It obtained its name in 1976 after delegates at a conference being held by the American Legion in Philadelphia became ill with this strain of bacteria for the first time.

Hospital chiefs insist it is not uncommon for testing to detect the bacteria and most people exposed do not go onto develop Legionnaires’ disease.

The symptoms are mild headaches, muscle pain, fever, persistent cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea.

A statement from North East London NHS Foundation Trust said: 'During routine water testing at St George’s Hospital in Hornchurch, preliminary results show elevated levels of legionella bacteria in sections of the water system.

'To ensure the safety of patients at the hospital, NELFT has made the decision to move bed-based patients from the hospital.

'There are currently 44 patients in two wards at St George’s. Plans are being finalised to move patients to suitable accommodation later today.

'We are closed to inpatient admissions. Other services on site will remain open and are subject to ongoing review. Final test results are expected on Monday.

'It is not uncommon for routine testing to detect legionella bacteria.

'Legionella bacteria are widely distributed within the environment and can be found in artificial water sources such as water towers associated with cooling systems, domestic water systems and spa pools, and natural water sources such as rivers and streams.

'Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become ill with Legionnaires’ disease and the illness cannot be spread from person-to-person.'

Plans were already under way to move inpatient facilities from St George’s Hospital following concerns relating to the estate infrastructure, the trust said.
