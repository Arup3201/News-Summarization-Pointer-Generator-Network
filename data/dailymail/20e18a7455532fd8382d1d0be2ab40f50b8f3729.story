It's that time of year again when I realise that Christmas has crept up on me before I'm ready. Of course I know it's coming - but those final few weeks of November go by so fast, don't they?

One minute it was October and I was cursing the shops for daring to mention the C word. The next, it was the first week of December and I had not a gift to my name, and not a free weekend to shop before the Big Day. 

Which is how I found myself hurtling round Gatwick's South Terminal at breakneck speed, doing my entire Christmas shop in two hours.

Quick gifts: The Lulu Guinness shopper, left, and the Aspinal coin purse, right, were no brainers for the girls in the family. Lulu Guinness foldaway lips tote: Airport price: £29.17, high street price: £23.25; Brit large Cosmetic Pouch: Airport price: £45.83, high street price: £55

Easy buy: I snapped up these children's Converse at JD Sports for £23 (same price as high street as children's items are not taxed)

It was last Friday ahead of a weekend away to Spain when I realised I had left myself with precisely no Christmas shopping days. 

A combination of family gatherings, children's parties and work conspired to ensure this year it would be impossible to hit the shops for a clear day.

So when I arrived, child- and baggage-free, two hours early for my flight to Valencia and was faced with a load of glossy new shops at Gatwick (they've just spent £21m doing up the South Terminal departure lounge), I had the bright idea of squeezing it all into the time I had before I flew.

If I could nail the 20-something-and-counting presents I needed to buy for my family before I boarded, Christmas would be saved...

This optimistic notion was fuelled not only by the shiny new shops, but also the 20% discount on High Street prices generally offered (who doesn't love a bargain?) and the fact that they offer a Shop, Fly, Collect service, so I didn't have to lug around a single bag. I hate lugging bags, so this was very much good news.

Also, it would all be waiting for me in Arrivals when I returned from my holiday.

With my game face well and truly on, I scanned the South Terminal and spied an Aspinal of London (the first to be located in an airport), Ted Baker, Zara, JD Sports, Dixons and Harrods, along with Ernest Jones jewellers (another airport first) and various smaller shops selling quirky bits and pieces.

Fun and functional: Children's JVC headphones from Dixons for my three-year-old son; touchscreen running gloves from JD Sports for the brother-in-law. Nike Elite Storm Fit running gloves: Airport price: £18.33, High street price: £23.00

Aspinal - think super luxe leather goods at a genuinely surprisingly affordable price - proved most fruitful, bearing a Union flag purse, orange leather passport holder, croc diary, gorgeous leather keyring and snakeskin cuff that will keep the females in the family happy.

It was also the most lethal: I self-gifted myself more than once and could have kept on going.

JD Sports let me nail three children and a brother-in-law at once, with mini Converse trainers at £23, a mini Arsenal kit for £33, Nike Elite running gloves with iPhone touchscreen capability for £18 and a Nike football for £7.

In Dixons I found child-safe headphones by JVC, £13, for my three-year-old son, plus one of the brilliant X-Mini yo-yo speakers for a friend, priced under £25, which is the same price you could get it for online (but with no delivery cost). I take them everywhere and recommend them to everyone I know; the sound for the size is epic.

Dad got lucky with a long-sleeved Lacoste poloshirt, while mother and auntie were sorted with Chanel No.5 perfume for £53 instead of £66 and a Swarovski bangle for £34.

What I liked best about the shopping, apart from the obvious money-saving aspect, was the number of unusual or unexpected (and actually also useful) gifts I could buy that I actually hadn't seen on the High Street - and the selection that meant I could get people things they would really want, rather than the host of emergency books and booze you'd expect from last minute airport shopping.

Case Luggage travel accessories shop yielded some really cute Lulu Guinness folding shopping bags, with a black nylon tote that folded up into a pair of shiny red or pink lips - and they only cost £29 (RRP £36).

A handy X-Mini speaker makes the perfect present for frequent travellers - the sound is truly epic for the size of the speaker. I recommend these to everyone. Right, a Go travel adapter made a perfect bargain stocking filler

Luxe for less: I solved a few tricky customers with Jo Malone candles for £31.20 instead of £39

I found a very handy little gizmo that plugs into the car lighter to provide an adapter for two USB cables, so both front-seat passengers of the car can charge their phones at once (genius).

The booze selection was excellent too. My cousin is a collector of unusual vodka bottles and has pretty much seen 'em all. But I found at least six to eight vodkas I suspect he won't have seen - from artisan English brand Chase to premium versions of big brands like Belvedere, Grey Goose and Absolut. I managed to narrow it down to a very enticing-looking bottle of Stolichnaya Elite that I know he will love.

I picked up a bottle of the Moschino Disaronno amaretto for a friend too (I couldn't resist the heart-motif wrap - it's going to be hard to part with that one), and a bottle of Café Patron tequila for a pal who has been known to smuggle her own bottle into more than one pub in her time.

A tricky uncle and discerning colleague were ticked off with Jo Malone candles for £31.20 instead of £39.  I know many people deem the scented candle a lazy, cliched gift... but I absolutely disagree. If it's the right one, it's a joy to receive - and with the beautiful Jo Malone wrapping, it's a joy to give as well.

Christmas spirit: Moschino Disaronno made a lovely gift for a girlfriend, while Cafe Patrón goes to one of my wilder pals

By now the flight was showing boarding and my previous gentle stroll around the shops turned into a frantic dash as I vowed to finish the job I'd started.

A last minute whizz round Harrods (actually a very, very nice 6,500sq ft version of the store, with clothes, food and trinkets) yielded the rest of my gifts.

Chocolate coffee beans topped up Mum, ground coffee in an attractive printed tin did Dad, biscuits for Nan, cocoa-covered almonds for another auntie.

It felt utterly surreal having just dropped a few hundred quid in a series of shops yet finding myself walking empty handed to my gate to board my flight - but let me tell you, it felt frickin' brilliant to have got the Christmas shop out the way - and in such a fuss-free fashion.

Knowing that passengers have an average of 30 minutes to browse the shops, the stores are staffed to the hilt. All tills are open at all times and assistants are dotted around to make sure no one is left unattended.

It makes for a very slick and pain-free experience - which is the opposite of the feeling you get when battling the crowds on Oxford Street or in a busy shopping centre.

And the best bit? You get to go on holiday as well. Now if only they would wrap it for me too...
