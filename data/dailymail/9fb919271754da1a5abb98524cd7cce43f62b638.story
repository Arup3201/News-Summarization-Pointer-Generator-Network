Britain needs to combat ‘monstrous’ Islamic State fundamentalists before they bring ‘mayhem on our own streets’ David Cameron said this morning - before setting off on another holiday.

The Prime Minister insisted he was not ‘sending in the British Army’ to Iraq, but maintained that it was right to use the UK’s ‘military prowess’ to help the Kurds fight Islamic State jihadists.

Mr Cameron’s remarks came after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon revealed Britain’s involvement in Iraq could last for ‘months’.

Despite the stark warnings Mr Cameron revealed this morning that he was set to go on holiday again this week - despite the US President cutting short his break for emergency meetings at the White House.

The PM will spend time in Cornwall with his family - less than a week after returning from Portugal 12 hours earlier than planned to chair an emergency meeting on the Iraq crisis.

Mr Cameron defended his holiday plans
 this morning. Asked whether it was right that he was going away amid 
efforts to tackle the threat from Islamic State extremists, he said he would remain 'within a few feet of a BlackBerry'.

'I always make sure there are senior ministers on duty in Westminster,' he said after delivering a speech in central London.

'But
 I don't hand over the Government to a deputy. Wherever I am, wherever I
 am in the world I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry and an 
ability to manage things should they need to be managed.

'And
 indeed as I have done on I think almost every holiday that I have 
enjoyed over the last few years, to return instantly should that be 
necessary.

'For the next few days I shall not be terribly far away, so if that's necessary you will find me at my desk.'

David Cameron said he was always available on his blackberry - even from holiday

Mr Cameron has insisted British troops will not be sent to Iraq - but claimed it was imperative to help the country's fledgling Government battle Islamic State forces

Mr Cameron's remarks came after the Defence Secretary told troops in Cyprus that Britain needed to help Iraq combat terrorism. His remarks came amid a series of dramatic developments on the ground that will fuel concerns about mission creep and prompt fresh demands for the recall of Parliament.

Mission: A RAF Tornado lands at RAF Akrotiri. British military planes are flying deeper into Iraq to capture surveillance footage of jihadist fighters

Purpose: Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and transporting supplies to Kurdish forces

David Cameron this morning insisted Britain was 'not going to get involved 
in another war in Iraq' adding: ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground.'

But the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon yesterday revealed troops had been on the ground in Iraq for the first time since British forces withdrew from the country in 2009.

Regular soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment were in the Kurdish region last week to prepare an evacuation of trapped Yazidi refugees from Mount Sinjar.

The SAS has also reportedly been in the country for six weeks. 

A new deployment of 150 special forces troops is likely to begin this week.

British military planes meanwhile are flying deeper
 into Iraq to capture surveillance footage of jihadist fighters to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces on the ground.

The new deployment of 150 special forces troops is likely to begin later this week. It will include signals specialists and electronics experts with equipment capable of intercepting voice transmissions at a distance of more than 150 miles.

There will also be men from a new SBS unit which will be used to monitor sensitive areas of the Jordanian border.

But speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning, Mr Cameron insisted Britain was not being dragged into another war in the Middle East.

He said: ‘What we are trying to do is to help with the situation that we face.

‘First of all, that is the humanitarian situation that we face... but alongside the humanitarian crisis there is also a political and extremism crisis in Iraq that has a direct effect on us back here in the UK.'

He added: ‘So we are helping the Kurds, we are working with the Iraqi government to make sure it is more representative of the whole country and, of course, we are working with neighbours and allies to put the maximum amount of pressure on IS and make sure it is properly dealt with.

‘We have said that if the Kurds, the Peshmerga, want to have arms from us, that is something we would consider favourably.

‘Up to now they have not been making that request. Really the sort of weapons they have been using have been more eastern bloc variety, and so they have been supplied by others.’

Mr Cameron said he viewed the Kurds as the ‘first line of defence against these murderous extremists in IS that are causing so much damage in Iraq’.

But he insisted that IS had already started inflicting ‘damage here in Europe’, highlighting a shooting at a Jewish museum in Brussels.

‘We have already had the first IS motivated attacks in Europe; for instance, the dreadful terrorism that took place in Brussels just a few weeks ago.’

However, he stressed: ‘I want to be absolutely clear to you and to families watching at home, Britain is not going to get involved in another war in Iraq.

‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground. We are not going to be sending in the British Army.

‘Yes, we should use all the assets that we have, our diplomacy, our political relationships, our aid, the military prowess, the expertise that we have to help others - we should use these things as part of a strategy to put pressure on Islamic State and make sure this terrorist organisation is properly addressed and it cannot cause mayhem on our own streets.’

The PM said ‘keeping people safe here at home’ was his ‘number one, two and three priorities’.

Yesterday, Mr Cameron said Britain 
should use its military prowess to stop Islamists creating ‘a terrorist 
state on the shores of the Mediterranean’. He said the UK was ‘in  the 
middle of a generational  struggle against a poisonous and  extremist 
ideology’.

The Prime 
Minister added: ‘If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this 
exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger 
until it can target us on the streets of Britain.’

Until
 now, Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and 
transporting supplies to Kurdish forces. But Mr Cameron, writing in a 
Sunday newspaper, said: ‘True security will only be achieved if we use 
all our resources – aid, diplomacy, our military prowess – to help bring
 about a more stable world.’

He added: ‘We need a firm security 
response, whether that is military action to go after the terrorists, 
international co-operation on intelligence and counter-terrorism or 
uncompromising action against terrorists at home.’

While
 saying he did not back full-scale military involvement and ‘sending 
armies to fight or occupy’, Mr Cameron left open the possibility of 
Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish 
troops on the ground.

Speaking
 on a visit to the RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, Mr Fallon said: ‘This is
 not simply a humanitarian mission. We and other countries in Europe are
 determined to do what we can to help the government of Iraq combat this
 new and very extreme form of terrorism.’

Mr
 Fallon revealed that troops from 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment 
flew in as part of preparations for a helicopter mission to save 
stranded members of the Yazidi group on a mountainside. They were on the
 ground for 24 hours before flying back to Cyprus after the operation 
was called off. 

Addressing airmen and soldiers at the 
base, Mr Fallon said: ‘This mission isn’t over. The humanitarian needs 
are there…There may well now be in the next few weeks and months other 
ways that we may need to help save life, protect people. We are going to
 need all of you again and the surveillance you are able to give us.’

Hundreds of refuges, including women and children, sought shelter in a primary school in Dohuk in Iraqi Kurdistan after escaping from Mount Sinjar

Plight: Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community settle at the Qandil mountains near the Turkish border outside Zakho, 300 miles northwest of Baghdad

Support: Displaced Yazidis find shelter under a bridge. David Cameron has left open the possibility of Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish troops on the ground

In recent weeks IS fighters have 
seized vast swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, advancing towards Baghdad
 and prompting US air strikes.

Yesterday,
 US warplanes helped by Kurdish forces were on the brink of recapturing 
the Mosul Dam, which supplies water and electricity to northern Iraq, 
amid ‘fierce resistance’ from Islamists. It was reported yesterday that 
another 300 Yazidi men from the Sinjar mountain area are among their 
victims, with some beheaded in front of their own families.

British
 military planes are filming surveillance footage on jihadist fighters 
which is passed to the US and used to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces.   
The UK has more than 100 members of the SAS, SBS, Reconnaissance 
Regiment and signals specialists in Baghdad and around Irbil.
