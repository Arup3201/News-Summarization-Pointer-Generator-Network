A multi-million pound deal which saw coal mining firm Bumi split from its co-founder was sealed amid a flurry of explosive tweets in which warring billionaires described each other as 'dumb'.

London-based mining firm Bumi - now known as Asia Resource Minerals plc (ARMS) - has completed a long-awaited separation from its co-founders - an Indonesian family conglomerate known as the Bakrie group.

After the restructuring deal was closed, fellow founder Nat Rothschild – the 42-year-old scion of the wealthy banking dynasty - took to his Twitter page to take a swipe at a member of the Bakrie family.

He posted: ‘Thanks for buying back a worthless pile of turd’ directly to Aga Bakrie, the son of the chairman of the Indonesian group.

It started a flurry of fiery messages between the pair, who have been bickering since the company's shareholders voted in December to split from the co-founding Bakrie family in a major restructure.  

Oxford-educated financier Mr Rothschild also labelled Adika ‘Aga’ Nuraga Bakrie, 32, ‘extremely dumb’, during the public Twitter row which erupted after the corporate break up.

He wrote: ‘Whilst your dad is an evil genius (yes I'm paying nirwan a compliment), the word on the street is that you are extremely DUMB!’

Mr Bakrie responded to the message with: ‘Haha... "Dumb" I believe that’s the word that has been associated with you by most of the people that I have met.’

Asia Resource Minerals was founded as Bumi in 2010 by the influential Bakries and financier Nat Rothschild, with the aim of giving London investors access to promising Indonesian coal assets.

Aga Bakrie, the son of the chairman of the Indonesian-based Bakrie group, hit back at the claims and labelled Bumi co-founder Mr Rothschild 'dumb' as well

But the business suffered from boardroom rows, allegations of wrongdoing and falling coal prices. Its shares have lost almost 80 per cent of their value since the business was set up.

To revive the business's fortunes, 
shareholders voted in December to split from Indonesia's Bakrie family, 
but it took longer than expected due to difficulties of raising the 
necessary cash.

With
 the split completed, ARMS will now focus on turning around its other 
main Indonesian subsidiary, Berau Coal, while giving up a stake in 
Asia's top thermal coal exporter PT Bumi Resources.

ARMS Chief Executive Nick von Schirnding said he felt ‘vindicated’.

He
 said: ‘There were a number of stakeholders saying this would never 
happen. I can't say it has been easy, it was a complicated transaction, 
but to have achieved this is excellent for our shareholders.

‘Our
 focus is on our subsidiary now. We need to regain credibility and 
today's announcement is the first step in that direction.’

ARMS said it would now return $400 million to shareholders but did not give any timeframe and did not specify in what form the money will be returned.

Shareholders welcomed the completion of the separation but said they hoped ARMS would return closer to the $501 million it got from the deal.

Mr Rothschild said: ‘I think it's important to return the maximum amount of money because there is no appetite from the major shareholders, certainly not from me, to entrust money with the management team in London to redeploy that capital.

‘We want the business ... to be run as efficiently as possible and for all dividends to be passed through to shareholders.’
