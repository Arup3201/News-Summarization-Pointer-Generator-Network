Suspected illegal migrants have been caught on camera prying open the door of a lorry in Calais before jumping inside in a desperate attempt to make it into Britain.

Courier Ben Irwin, 34, shot the video earlier this month while travelling along the access road to the ferry terminal at Calais, France. Dozens of ferries leave the terminal in Calais to head to Dover every day.

Mr Irwin, from Derbyshire, said: 'There were around 300 immigrants crowding around the lorries, trying to get in. I couldn't believe it. It's so dangerous.'

On the approach to the ferry port, queuing means vehicles can only travel at around five miles per hour.

It is believed migrants try to take advantage of the slow speed to pry open the lorry doors and jump inside the vehicles.

Mr Irwin said: 'It's terrifying. I drove up to the bumper of the lorry in front to try and stop them from getting in.

'When I refused to back up, they became very aggressive and started battering and pushing my vehicle to try and get in. That's what the thumping noise is towards the end of the video.

'Lorry drivers live in fear of this happening. I've heard of drivers being beaten half to death after trying to stop immigrants from entering their vehicles.

'We just wonder which one of us will be next. It won't be long before someone gets killed.'Â

The number of illegal migrants arrested as they try to get to Britain from Calais has doubled to more than 7,000 in six months, figures revealed last week.

Despite tougher security measures introduced by the French, there has been a huge increase in those trying to make their way through the Channel Port to the UK.

Figures compiled by the local prefecture show 7,414 were arrested between January and June this year. This compares to 3,129 for the same period in 2013.

Last week the mayor of Calais passed an official decree banning the setting up of camps in areas, saying they were a danger to public health.

A number of camps have been bulldozed, with the authorities doing everything possible to get the migrants to leave the town.

Mr Irwin said: 'It's terrifying. I drove up to the bumper of the lorry in front to try and stop them from getting in'
