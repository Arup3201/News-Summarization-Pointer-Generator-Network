The most expensive home ever listed in the Kansas City area is on the market for a staggering $14 million despite the fact that it is located next door to the largest refuge dump in the area.

The property was until recently the home of Ron Deffenbaugh Sr., a self-made multi-millionaire who created Deffenbaugh Industries Inc., a waste management business which operated the Johnson County Landfill next door.

Deffenbaugh owned the land and decided to build his dream home it 2009, despite the fact that 1.8 million tons of household waste and other garbage continues to be dumped nearby each year.

The Johnson County Landfill can't be seen from the mansion, but neighbors say its presence is evidence when the wind blows the right direction

A freak accident in 2007 left Ron Deffenbaugh almost completely paralysized and doctors told him that he wasn’t likely to live much longer. He died in August

The landfill can't be seen from the mansion, but neighbors say its presence is all too evidence in certain conditions.

'It depends on how bad the weather is,' neighbor Bruce Bird told The Kansas City Star. 'You get some evenings when it’s calm and it’s pretty rank.'

Last year, the city of Shawnee fielded 41 odor complaints on 35 different days against the Johnson County Landfill.

The location of the mansion – known as the RD Ranch - isn’t the only unusual thing about it. It was also built specially to cope with the fact that Deffenbaugh was a quadriplegic.

A freak accident in 2007 left him almost completely paralyzed and so the 21 room, 13,000-square-foot mansion was built especially to cater to his needs.

One unusual feature is that every room features a hookup for the air tubes that Deffenbaugh needed to breathe.

The central oxygen system and the backup generator to run it in case the power went out are in an attached garage.

The home also has a geothermal heating and cooling system, with tubes supplying warmth under the floors.

After his accident, doctors told Deffenbaugh that he wasn’t likely to live much longer, but in fact he lived for another seven years and his passing away last August aged 73. 

During his final years living in the mansion the twice divorced man was tended to dozens of staff. 

No expense was spared to ensure that Deffenbaugh's final years were comfortable. All the furniture is custom-built and the wood floors on the main level are Brazilian cherry wood.

The opulent five-bedroom property includes a built-in saltwater aquarium and a 120-square-foot screen home theater. 

The house has five full bathrooms and four half baths and even the towel racks in the master bathroom are heated.

Outside are waterfalls and fountains, an indoor-outdoor swimming pool and horse stables. 

The basement includes a walk-in refrigerator and walk-in freezer, as well as a commercial washer and dryer set.

The trustees of Deffenbaugh’s estate have hired Crown Realty to sell the property, they say neighbors have assured them that the landfill odors causes little discomfort.
