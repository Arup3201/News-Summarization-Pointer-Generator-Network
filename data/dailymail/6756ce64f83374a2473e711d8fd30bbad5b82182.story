Humbled: Nicolas Sarkozy leaving the Elysee Palace where he confirmed his decision to retire from politics

A DEVASTATED Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed today that he is to quit politics for good, but added: 'I love life too much to be bitter'.

The 57-year-old conservative even said that he wanted people 'to leave me alone' so that he could have a quiet life with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni.

Sarkozy said : 'I hope to live a normal life. I lost the election but journalists continue to prevent me from taking a break.

'I'm unable to have lunch with my family. I hope I can now be left to enjoy a bit of quiet.'

He made the frank admission after becoming the first French president for 31 years to be rejected after just one term.

Sarkozy lost Sunday's nationwide election to his bitter Socialist rival Francois Hollande, soon after opinion polls confirmed Sarkozy's status as the most unpopular head of state in recent history.

Today, looking ashen-faced and exhausted, Sarkozy invited his campaign team to the Elysee Palace in Paris and confirmed his decision to retire.

During an hour long meeting he said he would not contest a seat for his party, the UMP, at the parliamentary elections in June, saying: 'A page has turned for me. I will not be a legislative candidate now, or in elections to come.

'Rest assured I will renew my party card, and I will pay my dues. But I will quit operations.'

Referring to other leaders who have lost elections since the financial crash in 2008, Sarkozy added: 'Of course it would have been better to win, but just look at how others have left office.

'Our failure was not a humiliation, as all the pollsters and the press predicted before Sunday.'

Urging UMP members to stick together, the 5ft 5ins president said: 'Do not be divided - little chiefs and little teams draws everybody to the bottom'.

Sarkozy said the election result was much closer than predicted, saying: 'I told you so. It was almost possible. This proves that I did not lie to you. We were very close.'

Sarkozy will officially be president until May 15th, when Hollande takes over following a ceremony at the Elysee Palace.

But Sarkozy said: 'If I could, I'd go tomorrow, but there are traditions to follow. I will respect them and the handover will take place with Francois Hollande, as it took place with Jacques Chirac and me.'

Hollande's first official job at President-elect will be to commemorate the end of the Second World War at the Arc de Triumphe in central Paris tomorrow.

The ceremony will see President Sarkozy join Hollande at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

At the end of his meeting with the party faithful, Sarkozy said : 'We did not quit. I look forward to seeing you again, to talk about the old time.'

Sarkozy is a qualified lawyer, but is unlikely to return to practising. His wife is a multi-millionaire heiress, so neither will have any need to go out and earn a living.
