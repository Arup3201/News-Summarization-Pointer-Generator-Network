A New York mother who was critically injured by a falling cart dropped by two teens from four storeys high is struggling with everyday tasks and has had to relearn her own name.

It has also just emerged that Marion Hedges, 47, technically 'died at the scene' after the heavy plastic cart crushed her as she shopped for Halloween candy for poor children at a mall with her son.

The mother-of-two was brought back to life by a doctor who happened to be passing who carried out first aid on her.

'She actually died in the parking lot. There was no pulse, and she wasn’t breathing. The doctor brought her back to life with CPR,' a law-enforcement source told the Post.

Guarav Patel, a resident doctor at New York Hospital happened to be shopping with his wife and year-old son, when he stopped to revive Mrs Hedges on October 30.

'She’ll never be the same. They 
altered her life forever. She will have cognitive issues,' a 
law-enforcement source told the Post.

The
prank has left Mrs Hedges unable to take part in the charitable events 
she has devoted herself to over the years, however she has said she 
forgives those responsible.

The source told the Post: 'She's not the same person. Talking to her is like talking to a nine-year-old or a 90-year-old.

'She gets emotional and forgets things quickly. There is short-term memory loss.'

Forgiving: Mother-of-two Mrs Hedges said she has no ill feeling towards the two boys responsible for her injuries

During
her painful recovery, Mrs Hedges, who is best known for her charity 
work, has had to relearn her name and basic functions.

Jeovanni Rosario and Raymond Hernandez, both 12 at the time of the near-fatal prank, have both been charged with the crime.

While in custody, the suspects turned on each other at one point, the source told the Post. 'Both of them ratted out each other.'

'For a moment, they were angry [at each other], but they went back to being friends,' the source added.

Facing felony assault charges, the pair confessed to the mindless act while laughing about it in police custody.

'Numerous detectives told them to calm down. They thought it was a joke. They calmed down for a moment, but they went right back into it,' the source told the Post.

Hernandez is due to appear in Manhattan Family Court on January 17 and Rosario has a on January 26.
