A doctor infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone who arrived in the United States on Saturday critically ill from the deadly virus is believed to be the worst-affected  patient  to ever be treated in the country.

The University of Nebraska Medical Center said that Dr. Martin Salia, a legal US resident who lives in Maryland, had 'safely arrived' in Omaha after a flight from Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.

He was taken by ambulance to the center's biocontainment unit, where he will be kept in isolation to avoid infecting others.

Dr. Salia is a general surgeon who had been working at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.

Patients, including mothers who hours earlier had given birth, fled the 60-bed Nebraska hospital after news of the Ebola case emerged, United Methodist News reported.

Dr. Salia is the third Ebola patient to be treated by the UNMC, one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients. 

Both of the previous patients survived.

He had traveled back to his home country to treat Ebola patients at Freetown's Connaught Hospital amid a devastating outbreak when he became infected.

He came down with symptoms of the virus on November 6 but test results were negative.

Dr. Salia then tested positive on Monday. 

Five other doctors in Sierra Leone have contracted Ebola — and all have died.

His evacuation was facilitated by the US government at the request of his wife, an American citizen who agreed to reimburse all expenses, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

'Just as we have done in previous cases, every precaution is being taken to ensure the evacuation is completed safely and securely, that critical care is provided en route, and that strict isolation is maintained,' Psaki said.

Doctors have said they were told that Salia is 'critically ill'.

They said his exact condition would be evaluated when he arrives, but that he is 'possibly sicker than the first patients successfully treated in the United States'.

'We immediately started preparing the unit and notifying staff members of this possibility,' biocontainment unit medical director Phil Smith said in a statement.

'We've obviously been through this a couple of times before so we know what to expect.'

Dr. Salia is believed to be the father of at least two sons. 

CNN reported that he has several children. 

There are currently no cases of Ebola in the United States, where nine people have been treated for the killer virus. 

Dr. Salia is the tenth. 

Only one - Liberian-born Thomas Eric Duncan - has died from the disease on US soil.

The cases are part of the deadliest Ebola outbreak ever, which has killed more than 5,100 people in West Africa and infected nearly 15,000 in total, mostly in hardest hit Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Health workers from the Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team 7 place a body in a grave at King Tom cemetary in Freetown on November 12, 2014. Dr. Martin Salia arrived in the U.S. from Freetown on Saturday

Despite some hopeful signs - Liberia has lifted its state of emergency and the DR Congo announced the end of its own, unrelated, outbreak of Ebola - the recent deaths of three people in Mali have fueled fears of a new African hotspot.

There is no known cure for Ebola, one of the deadliest known pathogens, but trials for several possible treatments were announced this week in West Africa and Canada. 

The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids.

Salia received his surgical training from a group called the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons, which seeks to train African doctors on a level comparable to training they would receive in the U.S., said Richard Toupin, of Auburn, Indiana, a fellow medical missionary.

'He is one of the best-trained surgeons in his country,' Toupin said. 

'He is a very competent surgeon.'

Sons: The medic, who has at least two sons, including Hinwaii (left) and Maada (right), came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6. Tests results on Monday were positive, according to the official

Bruce Steffes, executive director of PAACS, said Salia graduated from the surgical training program in 2008. The training includes a requirement to practice in Africa for four years after completion. 

As a result, Steffes said, Salia was free to practice anywhere he wanted, but elected to stay in Sierra Leone, where the need for surgeons is immense.

'People like Martin are just absolutely dedicated, highly trained ... and doing their best in absolutely horrifying conditions,' Steffes said.

Jeff Bleijerveld, director of global ministries for the United Brethren in Christ church, said he last talked to Salia in February 2013, when they met to discuss planning for a hospital in the southern part of Sierra Leone. 

He recalled watching Salia perform a hernia surgery on a young boy, assisted by a handyman who was not actually a doctor. He recalled Salia leading the surgical team in prayer before the operation.

The United Brethren played an early role in Salia's medical training.

'He's a quiet leader,' Bleijerveld said. 

'Our people still have a real affection for him.'
