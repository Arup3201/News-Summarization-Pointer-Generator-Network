A dramatic film about the assassination of Osama Bin Laden could be controversially released before the U.S presidential elections in November, it has emerged.

Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein - a supporter of the Democratic Party - is in negotiations to buy Code Name Geronimo at the Cannes Film Festival.

It is believed the film producer will release the film in late September or October - which is likely to infuriate President Obama's Republican opponents.

Sony Pictures has already decided not to release the film Zero Dark Thirty - also about the assassination of the Al Qaeda leader - until December.

Its release date of December 19 was set after the scheduled release date for October drew criticism of the Republican party.

It was feared the film would bolster Obama's re-election prospects and those concerns are likely to be raised again with Code Name Geronimo.

Footage from the film was shown for the first time in Cannes on Wednesday. It is directed by John Stockwell.

The film tells the story of the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden and the efforts of the Navy Seals.

It is in the final stages of production and its asking price is rumoured to be $2million.

Sony has said it has no plans of moving its release date for Zero Dark Thirty, which is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who famously directed Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. 

Mr Weinstein previously released the anti-Bush documentary by Michael Moore 'Fahrenheit 9/11' shortly before the elections in 2004.

Osama Bin Laden was killed in May last year when U.S. Navy Seals raided the building in Abbottabad , Pakistan, that the terrorist mastermind had lived in for five years.

The raid was completed shortly after 1 am local time when bin Laden was shot once in the chest and once in the head by a U.S Navy Seal who announced 'For God and country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo', because Geronimo was the code-name given to the Al Qaeda leader.

President Obama himself said in the White House Situation Room watching events unfold, 'We got him.'

Before the U.S Navy Seals left the compound they destroyed one of the two top secret stealth helicopters that had delivered them to the house after it encountered difficulties on landing and therefore could not take off again.

Intelligence recovered from the home made public in the aftermath of his death showed Osama bin Laden wrapped up from the cold watching news coverage of himself.

In February 2012, Pakistani security agencies demolished the building to stop it becoming a shrine to the deceased Al Qaeda supremo.
