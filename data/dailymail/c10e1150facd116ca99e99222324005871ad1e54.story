Personal emails sent by the wife of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell to a businessman who lavished the couple with expensive gifts have been read out in court during their corruption trial.

The luxury goods he allegedly gave them - including a $7,000 engraved Rolex watch and images of the McDonnells riding the millionaire's Ferrari - were also shown to the jury.

On Friday, defense attorneys took aim at Jonnie Williams' testimony that his relationship with former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife was all about business - saying that the former CEO texted or called the first lady more than 1,200 times over the course of nearly two years.

Among the messages read in court, a particularly racy one Maureen McDonnell sent him the day an earthquake hit Virginia read: 'I just felt the EARTH MOVE AND I WASN'T HAVING SEX!!!!'

Questions: Businessman Jonnie Williams, seen leaving court Thursday, claimed he only had a professional relationship with former Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife - but their texts show otherwise

Disgraced: If found guilty, McDonnell, pictured on Thursday, could spend decades behind bars

Accused: Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, heads into the Federal courthouse in Richmond with lawyer Heather Martin on Thursday for her and her husband's corruption trial

The McDonnells are charged in a 
14-count federal indictment with taking more than $165,000 in gifts and 
loans from Williams in exchange for their help promoting his company's 
products, primarily the dietary supplement Anatabloc. If convicted, they
 could face decades in prison.

Williams, who is testifying for a third day, has said his relationship with the McDonnells was about benefiting his business, not friendship.

Williams testified on Thursday that he did not have a romantic relationship with former Governor Bob McDonnell's wife, Maureen.

A defense attorney had said earlier this week that Maureen McDonnell, her marriage with her frequently absent husband on the rocks, had developed a crush on Williams and that the former Star Scientific Inc. CEO had deceived her into believing he cared for her.

The relationship began when Williams 
met the McDonnells in New York following the election and Maureen needed a dress for the inauguration - and he offered to buy her one.

They
 later went on a luxury shopping spree, where he bought her $20,000 
worth of designer dresses and accessories from Bergdorf Goodman, Louis 
Vuitton and Oscar de la Renta.

A
 month later, she allegedly told him she could help him with his 
business if he helped their financial situation, all with her husband's knowledge, Williams testified.

In court, Williams detailed a pattern of 
requests for gifts by Maureen McDonnell and a $20,000 loan former 
Governor Bob McDonnell asked for, along with several events to promote 
Anatabloc the couple attended - including the product's official launch 
at the governor's mansion.

Williams said he handed out eight $25,000 checks to medical researchers at that event 'to prime the pump' for what he hoped would be state-sponsored clinical trials of Anatabloc.

He also talked about his discussions with the governor about transferring some Star Scientific stock to McDonnell so he could borrow against it.

Williams said he wanted to keep the deal secret because he knew it was wrong, and McDonnell went along.

'It could be violating laws. I don't know that. It could be,' he said.

He said he ultimately concluded he 
could not make the transfer without reporting it to federal regulators, 
so he just made a $50,000 loan instead.

Gifts: Williams also bought a Rolex that Maureen McDonnell then gave to her husband as a Christmas gift. This image of McDonnell wearing the watch was later sent by text to Jonnie Williams

Luxury: The Rolex cost nearly $7,000 and was engraved with: 'Robert F. McDonnell, 71st Governor of Virginia'

Generosity: A check among the evidence for the trial shows a $15,000 check made out by Williams' company to the catering company who provided food for McDonnell's daughter's wedding

Williams also wrote the 
family a check for $15,000 for their daughter's wedding catering and 
gave them yacht rentals and use of his private plane.

Among other gifts was an engraved Rolex watch he said Maureen requested and then gave to her husband for Christmas in 2012.

'It
 was a bad decision on my part to buy that watch when she asked for it,'
 Williams said. 'I shouldn't have had to buy things like that to get the
 help I needed.'

The watch was passed to the jury, where each juror briefly inspected it as a silent courtroom watched.

Maureen
 McDonnell also admired Williams' Ferrari and asked if anything like 
that would be available at his lake house, where the McDonnell family 
was planning to spend a vacation. Williams said no.

'She said, "It would be nice. We never get to do things like this",' Williams testified.

He had the car delivered and the jury was shown photos of Bob McDonnell driving the sports car.
