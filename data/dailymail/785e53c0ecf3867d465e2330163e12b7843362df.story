She shot to fame as the bubbly brunette runner-up on The Apprentice, and despite narrowly missing out on the crown, Luisa Zissman has proved that she is no second fiddle.

The 25-year-old entrepreneur has been showing off her figure in a series of tiny bikinis and figure-hugging dresses during her holiday in Marbella.

And now Femail can reveal the secret behind her killer curves.

Luisa paid for a fat-freezing treatment called Lipoglaze at LoveLite clinic in Harley Street last week to get in shape for her Spanish trip.

Holiday figure: The Apprentice finalist Luisa Zissman has been sunning herself in the Spanish sunshine and now the secret behind her bikini body has been revealed

The BBC1 reality show star is reportedly extremely self-conscious about her womanly hips and was desperate to lose a few inches off them before she hit the beach.

She had the £670 fat freezing body sculpting treatment -  even tweeting out a picture of herself when she was having the treatment.

So that's her secret! Luisa tweeted this snap of her undergoing the £670 treatment which freezes fat cells

At the time she tweeted: 'Having lipoglaze with loveliteuk in Harley Street! Marbella here I come! X

She later added: '@NataliePanayi ‪@LoveLiteUk it was fabulous I can recommend xx'

The treatment works by 
first gently heating and then rapidly cooling the target area. This 
causes the fat cells to crystallise and permanently destroys up to a 
third of fatty deposits per session.

The body then naturally eliminates 
this waste tissue over the next few weeks.

These kind of treatments have become very popular with the Marbella set who often have sessions to remove stubborn areas of fat to sculpt their bodies into shape just a few weeks before they go on holiday.

Fat freezing treatments, which usually last around 60 minutes and freeze fat cells which then waste away naturally, has also been used by Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead, former WAG Lizzie Cundy and TOWIE stars Ricky Rayment and Bobby Norris. 

Luisa, who is a mother to four-year-old Dixie, recently hit back at cruel comments about her body following a bikini photoshoot.

Writing on Twitter, she said: 'I think I look alright in the pics! I'm comfortable (just about) with my body and I've had a baby! #haters.'

Insecure: Luisa is reportedly insecure about her figure and wanted to shift a few pounds before her jaunt abroad
