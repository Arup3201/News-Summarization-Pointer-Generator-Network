Two of the women accused of covering up a damning internal report into a failed hospital inspection insisted last night that they never wanted their names to be kept secret.

Jill Finney, former deputy chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, and Anna Jefferson, the watchdog’s media manager, both insisted they wanted the truth to come out, despite allegations that they wanted heavy criticism of the CQC to be withheld from the public.

In the explosive report about the cover-up published this week, the two women were initially referred to as ‘Mr G’ and ‘Mr F’ after lawyers warned that naming them could breach the Data Protection Act or lead to libel lawsuits.

This led to further accusations of a cover-up and political pressure forced the CQC to reveal their identities, along with those of then CQC Chief Executive Cynthia Bower.

But now Miss Finney, who lost her new job at internet firm Nominet in the wake of the row, and Miss Jefferson, who is on maternity leave, have condemned the botched attempt to anonymise the report as it made the story far bigger.

Miss Finney, former Deputy Chief Executive at the CQC, said: ‘It was very clear that the redaction was worthless. I feel that the CQC threw a scrap of information to the media and ensured there would be an extended feeding frenzy.

‘I believe the Grant Thornton report should not have been published in the way it was this week.’

Miss Jefferson, due to return to the CQC as Media Manager next month, said: ‘I thought it was a very poor decision to anonymise it in the first place.’

Under fire: Cynthia Bower, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, was 'round the table' when the decision was taken to delete evidence of a botched CQC inspection

Asked if she felt like a scapegoat, she replied: ‘I certainly feel extremely vulnerable and I’m astonished that this has happened. That I could be on maternity leave and exposed to this, with absolutely no evidence at all. It’s like living in a nightmare.

‘I did absolutely nothing wrong and I’ve got evidence that I actually pushed for more scrutiny.’

The CQC had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ‘Serious Untoward Incidents’ including child deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria.

But it only launched a full investigation into the Morecambe Bay trust that runs the hospital in December 2011.

Consultants Deloitte said in a previously unreported review that ‘there may have been an earlier missed opportunity’ to intervene.

Astonishingly the CQC had no ‘written record’ of why it decided to investigate Morecambe Bay, where some 38 babies were delivered stillborn between 2002 and 2009, 15 more died in the first two weeks of birth and three mothers had died while pregnant or within a year of giving birth.

The watchdog carried out an internal review of its earlier inspections, but it was never published.

The latest high-profile account published by consultants Grant Thornton this week found that senior figures at the CQC agreed to suppress the account of their failings in monitoring University Hospitals Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust.

But speaking separately to the Mail on Sunday, Miss Finney and Miss Jefferson strongly rejected the claims against them.

They say that rather than containing devastating revelations about the health watchdog’s failures, the internal review actually blamed hospital managers.

Miss Jefferson said it was a ‘whitewash’ rather than a ‘smoking gun’.

Miss Finney said: ‘I, and others, made it clear to Grant Thornton that we thought the document let CQC off the hook and we thought it could have been far tougher.’

The pair, interviewed separately by the Mail on Sunday, deny there was any order to delete the review and stop it being published under Freedom of Information laws.

Miss Jefferson said she had actually called for a better, external review of the Morecambe Bay case last July and kept minutes of a meeting with new CQC Chief Executive David Behan where she ‘pushed very hard’ for this.

Miss Finney said: ‘There was no instruction to delete, but there was a need to do further work.’Employment lawyers are now looking into what action can be taken against the CQC officials, which could include stripping former Chief Executive Miss Bower and her deputy Miss Finney of their multi-million pound pensions.

Miss Jefferson is due to return from maternity leave next month but it is unclear if she will be able to return to her old job.

The Metropolitan Police have been asked by an MP to look into the alleged cover-up at the CQC while Cumbria Police are still looking into the death of one baby in the care of the trust, Joshua Titcombe.
