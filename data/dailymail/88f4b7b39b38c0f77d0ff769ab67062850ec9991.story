Authorities say a live hand grenade from World War II has been removed from a western New York state home.

Police in Albion in Orleans County told local media that the home was being cleaned out on Tuesday when the grenade was found in the basement.

Joe Roberts found the grenade in the afternoon, while he cleaned with his wife Linda Roberts, Orleans Hub reported.

Relic: This live WWII grenade was found inside an Albion, New York, home 

Success: The grenade was removed and is being detonated elsewhere 

The couple was working in the home following an estate sale held by homeowner Elizabeth Donovan, according to the newspaper.

Donovan lived in the house since the 1920s and had recently moved in with relatives, with Orleans Hub reporting that she went to Florida.

Albion police were contacted by Joe Roberts and photographed the grenade, then called in the sheriff's office bomb squad in neighboring Monroe County, the newspaper said.

The squad found the grade was from World War II.

The bomb squad took the explosive out of the home and planned to detonate it elsewhere, Orleans Hub reported.

A relative of Donovan's told the newspaper the grenade could have been in the house because one of her realtives served in the military in WWII and could have kept it as a souvenir.

At a different residence, the Roberts discovered a War of 1812 cannon ball, the paper said.
