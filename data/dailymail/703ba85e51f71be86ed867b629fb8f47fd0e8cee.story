Location-based dating apps, such as Tinder and the League, have a combined total of 91 million users.

Now a new study has found that nearly two thirds of these app users are men – and one in five will pay for premium services.

Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base.

Location-based dating apps, such as Tinder (screenshot pictured) and the League, have a combined total of 91 million users. Now a new study has found that nearly two thirds these app users are men – and one in five will pay for premium services

The study, done by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app, according to a report in the Guardian. 

'Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report.

'This might make them three times more likely than the average internet user to be doing this, but it does underline the importance of ad-supported models.'

Last year, a similar study by Pew Research Center found that men were more active on dating apps and sites.

Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base.  According to Tinder, users will log on to the company's app on average 11 times a day. Women spend as much as 8.5 minutes swiping left and right during a single session, while men spend 7.2 minutes

The research found that 13 per cent of US males had used a dating app or site, compared to only nine per cent of women in the states.

The report on usage trends comes as Tinder prepares to launch Tinder Plus, a new premium account that will see people pay for added features.

The service has already been tested in the UK, but is now about to launch in the US, according to Techcrunch - with an expected price of $6.99 per month.

The paid update is expected to allow users to search in other locations, although they may be charged extra for this.

Tinder sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day, with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app.

A new version of the app will display a big yellow 'undo' button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service.

According to Tinder, users will log on to the company's app on average 11 times a day.

Women spend as much as 8.5 minutes swiping left and right during a single session, while men spend 7.2 minutes.

The company claims to have 40 million users, trailing behind Chinese dating app, Momo, which is said to have 60 million active users.

Other emerging players include Bumble and Hinge. Bumble is a dating app that emphasises safety and puts women in control.

The Tinder rival works on the same principal as the original, but only women can start conversations. They've created female-focused marketing material urging ladies to 'take the leap'.

Hinge, meanwhile, links users on the basis of two factors; proximity, like Tinder, and social 'friends of friends' connections, using data from Facebook.

According to the company, 99 per cent of its users are college-educated, most commonly working in industries such as banking, media and fashion.

The GlobalWebIndex report also found that location-based dating apps are gaining the popularity in areas such as the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Vietnam.

These countries, according to GlobalWebIndex, now have more than 10 per cent of internet users who use location-based dating apps.
