Determined: Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, pictured, will dramatically lower the threshold of what is considered a spam call or text

New laws to end the scandal of nuisance marketing calls and text messages plaguing millions of people every day are to be brought in within weeks.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid will dramatically lower the threshold of what is considered a spam call or text and give watchdogs powers to hit the firms behind them with fines of up to £500,000.

He says he is determined to act following research showing that so many people are suffering cold calls that 58 per cent say they no longer want to answer their own phone.

There has been a particular explosion in nuisance calls offering to recover mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) from banks.

Spam text messaging is also on the increase, particularly messages about debt management and accident claims.

Industry figures show 30million Britons receive up to a billion nuisance phone and text messages a year.

But as the law stands, the Information Commissioner’s Office must prove a company caused ‘substantial harm or substantial distress’ by their conduct before it can act. The Government wants to reduce this so the ICO only has to prove the calls have caused ‘annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety’.

The ICO can launch an investigation on the basis of a single complaint about a nuisance call or text. 

In 2012 the watchdog levied a fine of £300,000 against Christopher Niebel, the co-owner of a marketing company, Tetrus Telecoms, which sent hundreds of thousands of texts about PPI and accident claims.

But last year the Information Rights Tribunal upheld Mr Niebel’s appeal that the messages did not meet the legal test which requires ‘substantial harm or distress’ to have occurred for a fine to be issued.

The watchdog warned that the ruling left it almost powerless to deter such companies even if they churn out industrial quantities of messages.

Consumers registered with the Telephone Preference Service are not supposed to receive unsolicited marketing calls unless they have agreed to receive them from a specific organisation, but millions do.

Mr Javid said he now planned to change the law after a rapid six-week government consultation, to be announced today. The law could be changed within 12 weeks of the end of the consultation.

‘Companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts, but have escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm,’ he said.

‘Being called day after day may not be “substantially distressing”, but that doesn’t make it acceptable. I want to make it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we don’t want.’

Anyone who wants to stop receiving nuisance calls can submit their details to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS).

Companies are legally obliged not to make unsolicited marketing calls to numbers listed on the register, and they must screen their data against it.

You can request that both your mobile phone and landline numbers are included, and individuals can sign up as well as companies or organisations. Once a number has been submitted, it will be added to the list within 28 days and calls should stop.

The TPS is a free service which is funded by the direct marketing industry.

Once you have signed up, your phone number will remain active on the register and there is no need to renew your listing.

Some 20million phone numbers are currently registered with the TPS – almost four-fifths of households.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? and chair of the Government's taskforce on marketing consent, said: ‘Changing the rules so it's easier for regulators to punish the companies making nuisance calls is a big step forward and a victory for the 125,000 people who supported our campaign on the issue.

‘Millions of us endure unwanted calls and texts every day so these new powers must be introduced as soon as possible. We look forward to the regulators using them to crack down hard on the unscrupulous firms that flout the rules.'

Which? is leading a separate review of how consumers provide and withdraw consent to receiving marketing calls, which will report to the Government by the end of December.

Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'The public clearly want to see a stop to nuisance calls and texts. 

'We welcome this proposed change in the law which will enable the ICO to make more fines stick, sending a clear message to the spammers and scammers that the rules around cold calls and spam texts must be followed.

'The majority of rogue marketing firms make hundreds, rather than thousands, of calls and the nuisance is no less a nuisance for falling short of the ‘substantial’ threshold. 

'This change means we could now target those many companies sending unwanted messages – and we think consumers would see a definite drop off in the total number of spam calls and texts.'
