A paedophile whose partner smothered their two children to death in a Spanish hotel has been found hanged in his jail cell.

Martin Smith, 46, was discovered by prison officers shortly after eating his evening meal. They battled to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead half an hour later.

His partner Lianne Smith, 44 - the mother of his sex abuse victim - has been placed on suicide watch in a Spanish prison where she is being held.

Smith, who claimed to be a psychic and hypnotist, was jailed for 16 years last March.

He had initially been arrested in 2007 and questioned by police over allegations he had sexually abused his step-daughter.

But Smith and his partner, former children's services manager Lianne Smith, fled to Spain with their daughter, Rebecca, three, and began building a new life.

A son, Daniel, was born in Barcelona and they set up a business among the thriving expat community.

Meanwhile police had launched an international manhunt for Smith and he was eventually tracked down and arrested.

He was held in a Spanish prison in March 2010 before being extradited back to the UK to face child sex abuse charges.

Fearing their children, Rebecca, then five, and son, Daniel, 11 months, would be seized by social services Lianne Smith fled.

She checked into a hotel in the seaside resort of Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava in May and just days later killed their two children.

Spanish police say the youngsters were suffocated in Room 101 of the Hotel Miramar.

A source at the prison where Miss Smith is being held said the couple wrote to each other every day from their prison cells.

He said: ‘Lianne was absolutely devoted to Martin and had always wrongly believed he was innocent.

'The letters were a big part of her day, both writing and receiving them.

‘The highlight of her jail life would be when Martin telephoned her each month. She told friends that she lived for those eight minute phone calls.’

Miss Smith had previously told friends that if her partner was not alive she would kill herself to ‘be with her children’.

Shortly before the youngsters’ deaths she had compiled an album of their last ‘wonderful holiday’ together on the Costa Brava, then sent it off with a chilling farewell letter to a publicist in the UK.

In it she said: ‘Please find enclosed a batch of pictures that I took this weekend of my children. Since last speaking with you an attempt was made to take my children.

‘Fortunately I got out of the city with them and gave them a short and wonderful holiday before events you will start to hear about in the Press.’

She has admitted smothering them but denies murder, claiming she was not criminally responsible for the youngsters’ deaths, due to mental illness.

At his trial Martin Smith, originally from North Shields, denied 11 counts of rape, attempted rape and indecent assault.

The court heard he had abused his step-daughter, Sarah – Miss Smith’s daughter from a previous marriage – for more than a decade, starting when she was just seven.

The jury heard that while her mother was out Smith would attempt to hypnotise her and put her in a trance before carrying out his sex attacks.

Yesterday his victim, now Sarah Richardson, 23, declined to comment over his death in prison.

After the case last year she waived her anonymity and spoke to the Daily Mail saying: ‘He abused me for more than a decade. Even after his arrest he prolonged my agony by fleeing abroad.’

She said by the time she was ten, Smith – who appeared on Living TV’s ‘Most Haunted’ – had started to use hypnotism to try to put her in a trance before raping her.

The nurse, who is now married to electrician Mark Richardson, said her mother was ‘cold’ towards her children and ‘deeply flawed and deluded’.

She said when she tried to tell her about the abuse her mother said: ‘If you are going to spread lies, you are no daughter of mine. I’m not going to listen to poison like that.’

Smith was discovered hanged on Monday when the cells were opened for prisoners to take part in their period of ‘evening association’.

He had earlier taken his dinner on a tray to his cell at HMP Manchester where he was locked in while staff had their own meals.

Deemed a ‘vulnerable’ prisoner, he was regularly risk assessed and was accommodated in a cell on his own.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Prisoner Martin Smith, 46, was found hanging by staff at HMP Manchester. Staff intervened but he was pronounced dead at the prison at approximately 7pm.’

British Embassy staff are believed to have broken the news to Lianne Smith along with a prison psychiatrist and social worker.

She was immediately moved from a hospital ward at the prison where she was under ‘low level observation’ to a secure psychiatric hospital on the jail complex where she was placed on a 24 hour watch by a specialist team.
