Dapper in a black button down coat and bowler hat, the Duke of Edinburgh today paid tribute to some of Britain's brave Afghanistan veterans.

Prince Philip flew to Germany to meet the tank regiment of the Queen's Royal Hussars and present them with their service medals.

During the event, which took place at Athlone Barracks in Sennelager, the royal inspected the ranks, pinning on medals as he went.

First deployed in 2011, the regiment worked closely with the Afghan police before handing them control of checkpoints.

The regiment returned to the country in 2013, fighting insurgents from their base at Camp Bastion, and  were among the last troops to leave the country.

The Duke, who is the colonel in chief, addressed more than 300 members of the regiment who took part in a parade, watched by their families, amid chilly conditions at the barracks.

Philip told the troops: 'It’s a great pleasure for me to be here again to present these campaign medals and also to welcome you all back again.

'I am quite sure your family and friends are delighted to see you and I hope you all had a good leave and are now back raring to go.'

Prince Philip himself served in the Royal Navy, fighting for Britain during the Second World War

C Squadron deployed to Afghanistan in June as the Warthog Group - one of the last British combat sub-units in Helmand Province.

The Warthog Group was made up of crews from the Queen’s Royal Hussars and dismounted infantry and was responsible for disrupting insurgent activity and for providing security in the province, alongside Afghan security forces, during the drawdown from Camp Bastion.

Based in Germany, the Queen’s Royal Hussars (The Queen’s Own and Royal Irish) is the senior Light Cavalry Regiment of the British Army.

Soldiers taking part in the parade and receiving their medals spoke of their pride at being among the last combat troops in Afghanistan.

Trooper Luke Edwardson, 24, from Newton Aycliffe in County Durham, said of his experiences in Helmand: 'It will never leave me and it was a big part of my life.

The Duke seemed in excellent spirits, taking his time to talk to each solider as he decorated them 

 Prince Philip kept warm during the outdoor service in a black button down coat over his suit

'It was the last tour so I feel proud to be part of it. There’s not going to be any more combat troops there.

'On the plane and having a quick look behind and thinking no-one’s coming back, I was really proud.'

Trooper Edwardson worked as part of a Barma team, carrying out the perilous task of clearing paths and searching for improvised explosive devices (IEDs) with hand held detectors ahead of armoured vehicles.

'It’s really hard,' he said. 'You’ve got to be really switched on. You’ve got the lives of other people in your hands. We had one IED blast but luckily no-one was hurt.'

He described today’s medal ceremony as 'one of the best days and proudest days of my life', adding: 'We’re one of the last squadrons to get operational medals from Afghanistan'.

Lance Corporal Sami Quinton, 21, from Devizes, Wiltshire, said of her first tour to Afghanistan: 'I’m definitely incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved.'

The Duke of Edinburgh is the colonel-in-chief of the regiment and a regular visitor to the German barracks

Philip was on jovial form as he was introduced to the families of troops living at the barracks

He looked thrilled to meet families - and they looked equally pleased to see him

The medic was the only servicewoman to be deployed in the regiment’s Warthog group, echoing the recent BBC1 drama Our Girl which follows a female medic serving in Afghanistan in an all-male team.

L/Cpl Quinton said of the television show: 'I’m glad they did it because at least people can see how the job is.

'When you’re in the vehicle, it’s incredibly hot, but when I’m treating people and looking after the lads - I treated a few of the locals as well - it makes me proud that I’m there to look after them.'

The soldier, who turned 21 while out in Afghanistan, said of being the only servicewoman in the group: 'It was hard to get used to but because of all the training we do, you do get a good bond with the lads.'

Trooper Neil Featherstone, 23, from Westbury on Trym, Bristol, who spent three months in Afghanistan on what was his first tour, said: 'Being the last combat troops - I was definitely proud to be part of it but it’s good to be home.'

Last night, the Duke joined the Queen at Chatham House for an evening event

The Queen also made a speech as she helped launch the Queen Elizabeth II Academy

He added of receiving his medal: 'When I was over there I did think about it but it doesn’t massively come into your head, but today standing out on parade is going to be a massive moment for me.' 

Prince Philip is a regular visitor to the barracks and was himself a member of the Armed Forces, fighting in the Royal Navy during the Second World War.

Stationed for several years in Malta following the end of the conflict, he was forced to give up his naval career following the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952

The flying visit to Germany came in the midst of a busy run of engagements for the 92-year-old, who last night joined the Queen at Chatham House.

He also attended the National Service of Remembrance last week alongside the Queen, Prince William and other dignitaries.
