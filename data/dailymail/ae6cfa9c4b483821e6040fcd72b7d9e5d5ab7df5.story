Seven Marines and four soldiers were presumed dead on Wednesday after an Army helicopter crashed during a night training exercise in Florida.

A UH-60 Black Hawk crashed in the Gulf of Mexico close to Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday night.

The area  was under a fog advisory when the crash took place. Foggy conditions remained on Wednesday morning which was hampering the search, Eglin public affairs specialist Sara Vidoni said.

A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that human remains had been found during the search but could not confirm the identities or number of people. 

Debris from the crash washed up on shore Wednesday, including landing gear and the side of the helicopter with the glass from the windows missing.

While a Pentagon official said the men were presumed dead, the hunt for the crashed helicopter remains a search and rescue mission and not search and recovery. 

Base officials said the Marines were part of a Camp Lejeune-based, 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Jacksonville, North Carolina.

The soldiers were from a National Guard unit based in Hammond, Louisiana.

The massive Black Hawk has been the workhorse of the U.S. Army since 1979.

They are primarily used to ferry troops to and from the battlefields, and support aircraft, but adapted models carry out medical evacuations with state-of-the-art equipment, search-and-rescue, armed escort and warfare missions.

Black Hawks were a central part of the U.S. military attack on Somalia capital, Mogadishu in 1993. They were also used in military operations in the Balkan region and Haiti in the 1990s; and supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The aircraft has also been used prominently by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq.

There are manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft based in Stratford, Connecticut.

It flies low to the ground to avoid detection and its twin-turbine engine can deliver a maximum speed of roughly 180mph.

During an afternoon press conference, Major General Glenn Curtis of the Louisiana National Guard confirmed that all of his soldiers were male and that three had aided in the Hurricane Katrina response. 

He described his men as 'tremendous pilots' and 'tremendous soldiers'  

Two Black Hawks took off together from the base ahead of the crash on Tuesday night. It is unclear how many soldiers were on board the other aircraft.  

A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that training missions usually took off from Eglin on a daily basis and said that it was up to individual units whether to fly in adverse weather conditions such as heavy fog. 

Fog was common in the region, the spokesperson said, and local pilots were used to the conditions.  The pilot on the Black Hawk which crashed on Tuesday night was from either Louisiana or North Carolina.  

The helicopter was reported missing around 8.30pm on Tuesday and search and rescue crews found debris from the crash around 2am on Wednesday.

Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.

'It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,' Urr said.

The tail rotor of the helicopter with its ID number was found during the rescue mission, according to military officials. 

Names of those involved were not immediately released, pending notification of next-of-kin.

But Mike Spinks from Eglin Environmental Public Affairs told WKRG: 'There is always hope.'

The Army helicopter took off from a nearby airport in Destin and joined other aircraft in the training exercise.

The UH-60 helicopter went down during a routine training mission off a remote stretch of beach between Pensacola and Destin.  

Two helicopters were flying a night training mission, but only one of the helicopters returned. Above patrol boats search the waters near the crash site on Wednesday

Names or the gender of those involved have not yet been released, pending notification of next-of-kin. Above, another shot of rescue crews near Navarre Bridge on Wednesday

The search for the missing Black Hawk helicopter was being hampered by heavy fog in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday morning 

The beach is owned by the military and is used for test missions.

The training area includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront that has been under the control of the military since before World War II. 

Military police keep a close watch on the area and have been known to run off private vendors who rent jet skis or paddle boards without permission.

Test range manager Glenn Barndollar said in August that the beach provides an ideal training area for special operations units from all branches of the military to practice over the water, on the beach and in the bay.

The military sometimes drops trainees over the water using boats or helicopters and the trainees must make their way onshore.

The black helicopter that crashed was a newer model that had a black box, which could shed light on what caused the crash if located.  

Military officials said on Tuesday night that the names of those involved were not immediately released following the crash off Eglin Air Force Base pending notification of next-of-kin
