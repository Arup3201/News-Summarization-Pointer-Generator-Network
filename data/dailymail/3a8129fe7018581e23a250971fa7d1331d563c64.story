Followers of fashion may be eagerly waiting for the Apple Watch, but an affordable alternative has just become available in the UK, having proved popular in the US.

The Pebble smartwatch is now available for £99 at Firebox.com.

The watch allows wearers to read texts and tweets on their wrist, as well as see incoming calls, check the weather, access fitness apps and tell the time.

Britons can now buy the popular Pebble smartwatch (pictured) for £99 via Firebox.com. The watch has proved popular in the US where it was he second most funded product in Kickstarter history

It is compatible with Apple and Android devices and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth so users don’t have to rummage in their handbag or pockets for their phone to see app notifications and messages, because they appear on the watch’s screen.

The watch has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark too.

They are water resistant and have a battery that lasts for between five and seven days. In contrast, it’s predicted that the Apple Watch, which is due to be released early next year, will need to be recharged daily.

Firebox predicts that the already popular devices will be in demand from UK customers for Christmas, partly because they are more affordable than some rival offerings.

Since its US release last year, Pebble has developed its open-source platform so that anyone can create an app for the device and companies are offering fitness tracker apps like Jawbone and Misfit, so people can check their running pace without carrying another gadget, for example.

Staples such as Twitter, Yelp and Foursquare are available too.

There are also 'extras' like a vibrating alarm and a choice of hundreds of watch face designs. 

Ben Redhead, Head of Buying at Firebox.com, said: ‘The Pebble Smartwatch is the definition of what wearable tech should be – fully-featured, uncomplicated and totally your own.

‘Wearable tech is becoming increasingly popular each year as the sophistication of wearable devices improves and, following the announcement of the Apple Smartwatch, consumers are now looking for versatile devices with a more affordable price tag, especially in time for the Christmas gifting season.’

The watch has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark.
