Unusual move: David Cameron plans to keep his senior ministers where they are

David Cameron has today revealed that his most senior ministers will not be moved in the Government reshuffle expected early next month.

In a highly unusual move Mr Cameron said George Osborne, William Hague, Theresa May, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith will all be singled out for praise when he makes his keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference next week.

In an interview with regional newspapers, Mr Cameron said: ‘I will be referring strongly to the great team that I have got.

‘You have seen the key figures have been in place, know their departments well and are really delivering - whether that is welfare, education, the Home Secretary, the economy, Foreign Secretary.

‘I have a really strong team, and I will have the opportunity to emphasise that.’

Mr Cameron’s comments effectively guarantee the five senior ministers their jobs in the long-delayed reshuffle, which could come at the end of next week.

Instead, the Prime Minister is expected to focus on moving talented female ministers into more senior positions with a view to promoting them into the Cabinet ahead of the General Election.

Education minister Elizabeth Truss, welfare minister Esther McVey and junior whip Nicky Morgan are all tipped for promotion to bigger jobs.

The Prime Minister is under pressure from some senior Tories to ease out some veteran Tories to ease out some veteran ministers, including Chief Whip Sir George Young and Commons Leader Andrew Lansley, to free up room at the top.

Sir George faced criticism last month after overseeing a Commons defeat on Syria in which 10 members of the Government failed to vote.

Mr Cameron has faced criticism for his failure to promote women in the past, amid claims he left two female Cabinet ministers in tears when he sacked them in last September’s reshuffle.

In 2009 he promised that at the end of his first term as Prime Minister he wanted a third of all of his ministers to be female. But the Cabinet still has only four female members.

Mr Cameron is also under pressure to find jobs for talented backbenchers from the 2010 intake, such as Nadhim Zahawi and Gavin Barwell.

The reshuffle was originally due to take place before the summer but has been delayed a number of times. The programme for next week’s Conservative Party conference in Manchester does not list any ministers by name, referring instead to their job titles.

Ed Miliband is expected to match Mr Cameron with his own, wider reshuffle in the coming days.

The Labour leader, who did not refer by name to any of his Shadow Cabinet colleagues in his own conference speech last week, will also use his shake-up to promote more women.

Treasury chief secretary Rachel Reeves, shadow health minister Liz Kendall and backbencher Stella Creasy are all expected to get big promotions.

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg and Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne are among those tipped for the sack. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is also likely to be moved to a new role after he was targeted by the Tories over his record as health secretary under Gordon Brown.
