Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock was left fuming at a disallowed goal he believed would have given his side a shock chance to force a draw at champions Manchester City.

James McArthur's header from Yannick Bolasie's cross midway through the second half when Palace were trailing 2-0 was ruled out for offside, presumably because referee Phil Dowd and his asssistants hadn't spotted Fernandinho by the touchline yards away from the action playing him onside.

Warnock, whose side need every point in an anticipated relegation battle, said: 'As you all know, we scored a cracking goal which would have put the whole stadium in a bit of doubt with 20 minutes to go. We sensed the fans were a bit nervous and we could have had a real go.

'It is hard enough to score at the Etihad without having a good goal chalked off. It is days like this I wish I was in the media who I could say what I thought without being fined.

'It was miles onside, not even close, two yards. He (the assistant) is in a bad position and it is a disgraceful decision. I am sure he will be sorry but at this level you have to get that right.

'We deserved to be back in the game and through no fault of our own, we weren't.'

Palace had only 27 per cent possession against a City side with no fit senior striker and James Milner playing as a makeshift number nine.

The Eagles have only scored 19 goals in 17 league games and Warnock is hoping chairman Steve Parrish brings him a powerful centre-forward in the January window.

'We need a little bit more physical presence,' said Warnock, who was without the injured Marouane Chamakh on Saturday.

'All the other lads have their attributes, it would be to supplement us really and give us options off the bench.'
