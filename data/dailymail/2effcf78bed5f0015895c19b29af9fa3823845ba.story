Osama Bin Laden's daughter-in-law is a longstanding supporter of the Royal British Legion and wears a poppy along with her husband on Remembrance Sunday.

Zaina Bin Laden, 56, from Cheshire, who is married to the Al Qaeda boss' son Omar, has said the charity is a 'big part of her life' and it shouldn't matter who she is married to.

She is to renew her membership of her local branch in Moulton, Cheshire, next week.

Zaina has donated money to the services charity for at least five years.

She told the Sun newspaper: 'Whoever my father-in-law was, a good cause is a good cause. Charity is a big part of my life.'

Zaina, who has in the past received 
death threats due to her relationship, said she does not visit her local
club but helps with fundraising.

Zaina - known previously as Jane Felix Browne - told of how she and 31-year-old Omar - whose mother is the terror leader's first wife Najwa - wear poppies on Remembrance Day.

She met her husband in 2007 on a trip to Egypt's pyramids and married him a month later.

Omar, whose middle name is Osama, has always insisted he had no contact with his father since before the 9/11 attacks of 2001

Zaina converted to Islam before she wed Omar, who is her sixth husband and 25 years her junior.

She defended her support of the legion saying it shouldn't matter who she is married to.

A grandmother of at least five children, she told the newspaper: 'This is a 
cause deep in my heart and it doesn’t matter who I am married to.'

Omar, whose middle name is Osama, has always insisted he had no contact with his father since before the 9/11 attacks of 2001.

At the time of his father's death in 2011 it was reported Omar denounced his father's killing as 'criminal'.

It was also reported he branded his father's burial at sea a humiliation for his family, though the views expressed on a website were never authenticated.

The couple attempted to have a baby through IVF but the former British pole dancer who carried their child, Louise Pollard, who went on to be a PA in London, miscarried twins for the couple in 2010.

A military source told the Sun: 'The Legion can’t deny her membership purely on the basis of her surname — that would be discrimination. But many members will be appalled.'
