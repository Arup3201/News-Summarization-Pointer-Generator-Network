Read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield as the Reds crashed out of the Champions League 

Brendan Rodgers branded Lazar Markovic's red card 'an awful decision' as Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League after drawing with Basle.

The Reds were already trailing 1-0 when the substitute was dismissed after pushing his arm out in the direction of Behrang Safari, but he did not appear to make contact, with the Basle player falling to the ground.

Markovic was given his marching orders by referee Bjorn Kuipers, with Steven Gerrard's late free-kick not enough to send them through.

'I thought it was an awful decision,' Rodgers said. 'I thought the referee was disappointing on the evening to say the least.

'Markovic came on and was bright, made a difference to the team, he was dynamic.

'He had just taken a touch away, he's obviously got his arm up, but if that's a sending-off you are going to have two or three sendings-off every single game. It was a really, really poor decision.

'I'm not even sure whether the referees have seen it, but I think he's seen the player hold his face and lie down, but there was no way that was a sending-off.'

On going out of the Champions League, the Reds boss added: 'We now have to fight going forward to be in it next season and obviously our performance level needs to improve over the course of the season.'
