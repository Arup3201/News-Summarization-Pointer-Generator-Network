'It's obvious that the little bear was just as frightened as the residents were,' said local law enforcement officers.

'Just how it escaped is still unknown. However, eyewitnesses said that the poor thing darted around in traffic for quite some time' the statement continued. 'But it eventually saw its tent and rushed towards it.

'The bear's handler appeared and took it in,' the police said, adding that neither any of the residents nor the bear itself came to any harm.

An investigation is currently underway in
 order to clarify how such a potentially dangerous animal could have 
escaped the care of its handler. If found guilty of oversight, the 
handler could face fines.

Circus staff later however claimed that the web video which captured the shocking event was in fact advertisement for the circus's performances, and it was staged for the publicity, something that had scorn poured on it from social media commentators who doubted it was true.

Performers claimed that everything had been thought up as a way to attract potential audiences to their shows, adding that they were prepared to pay fines if they have violated any laws.

From December 2015 Britain will ban wild animals such ions, tigers, bears and elephants from performing in circus shows, following a long campaign by animal rights activists.

Concerns have been raised over training methods which are said to include punishment and deprivation techniques in order to get the animals to perform tricks like riding bicycles or jumping through rings of fire.

According to animal rights group PETA trainers regularly abuse animals using whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, bullhooks, and other painful tools of the trade.

The animals are often confined to small cages on trailers or in boxcars or trucks for days at a time while the circuses move to different locations.
