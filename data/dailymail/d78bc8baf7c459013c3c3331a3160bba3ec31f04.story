A Florida police officer was arrested Tuesday night after allegedly posing as a teenage girl on Facebook in order to get photographs of naked boys.

Michael Gerard Stavris II, 30, of Palm Coast, was arrested on two counts of computer pornography under the child exploitation prevention act and one count of criminal use of personal identification information.

The arrest was a long time coming. According to officials, the police sergeant had been posing as a girl for more than a year.

According to the felony warrant issued March 25, Stavris allegedly created a fictitious profile on Facebook profile of a 16-year-old girl on November 25, 2012.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents began investigating Stavris in December 2013 after receiving a complaint.

Stavris allegedly created a fraudulent Facebook account using someone else's image in order to pose as a teenage girl.

Agents said he used the fake account to solicit teenage boys and then began to turn the conversations into those of a sexual nature before requesting sexually explicit photos.

The 6-foot-3, 400-pound man promised to perform oral sex on his victims in exchange for the pictures and even sent a picture of a woman's breasts to one victim.

The officer befriended at least 30 teenagers in the process, some of whom attended Flagler Palm Coast High School, where Stavris graduated from in 2002.

Posing as a girl, he asked for pictures of their penises. After the victims sent the photos, 'she' promised to perform oral sex behind their schools.

The affidavit said that in one case, a student was asked to meet if he would send the 'girl' a picture of his genitals.

According to the arrest report, he would solicit the male victims through the Facebook page and discuss what sexual acts they had committed. The page had between 30 to 40 friends younger than 18.

Stavris, a sergeant with the Bunnell Police Department, was arrested at the Bunnell City Hall, where all of the government offices are located.

He was booked and then released on a $125,000 bond. The charges carry a penalty of five years in jail.

'We will do everything in our power to see that all potential victims are identified and this person is charged with each crime that's committed,' said Dennis Bustle, special agent in charge of the FDLE's Jacksonville regional office.

Stavris worked as a patrol officer for the Duval County school system from October 2009 to July 2010, school officials said.

His job began after school hours were over and involved patrolling and responding to school-related calls citywide,

Before becoming a police officer, Stavris worked for the Flagler County school system from 2000 to 2006 teaching activities and safety to children through the eighth grade, said his Duval County school board personnel file.
