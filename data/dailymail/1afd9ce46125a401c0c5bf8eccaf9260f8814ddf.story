It was me! Tony Tahir, now retired, said his £10 haircuts inspired David Cameron's locks

A spat has erupted between two top hairstylists over who switched the Prime Minister’s parting to the left.

Stylist-to-the stars Lino Carbosiero – awarded an MBE in the New Year’s Honours list for services to hairdressing – has been widely credited  for giving David Cameron’s locks the distinctive new look.

But the PM’s previous barber, Tony Tahir, says the suggestion is rubbish and that it was he who gave the PM his look back in 2007.

Mr Tahir – who charged the Tory leader £10 per trim, as opposed to the £90 Mr Cameron currently pays – said: ‘It’s annoying to say the least. I’m sure Mr Carbosiero deserves his MBE  but the publicity he’s had from that side parting over the years must have helped.

'He may not have made the claim himself but he’s never denied it. Yet it is completely wrong. My daughter is furious and I’m getting calls from friends saying, "Tony, you’ve been stitched up."’

Mr Tahir, 63, who is now retired but ran his West London salon with wife Sandra, 66, said he remembered the day he gave the PM parting advice.

‘I’ve always had a wonderful eye for the way people have their hair,’ he said. ‘That particular day I said, “Mr Cameron, you’re wearing your hair on the wrong side. It’s making your face look very, very long.”

‘His hair grows from left to right so  if you comb it to go the opposite way, as he did, it sticks up. So I changed it and told him to look in the mirror and say which he liked best.

‘He agreed with me so I swept it from left to right, which flattened the top and pushed it down quite nicely.

‘I was glad he took my advice and I’m pleased it still suits him. But I feel a  bit like a film double. I did the work and some star gets the credit.’

Honoured: Although he never claimed so himself, David Cameron's current stylist Lino Carbosiero (left) has been widely credit with creating the Prime Minister's signature parting. He has been honoured with an MBE

Mr Tahir, who arrived in Britain from 
Cyprus in 1958, says he had many celebrity clients because his Hair and 
Tanning Rooms salon had a discreet entrance. He and his wife have now 
retired  to Cornwall.

Mrs Tahir said: ‘It is important to put the record straight. Tony did the parting. In fact we cut all the Cameron family’s hair.’

Mr Carbosiero, whose client list includes Adele and Madonna, is a consultant at upmarket Central London salon Daniel Galvin. He has styled Mr Cameron’s hair for the past five years but it is understood he was not nominated for his award by the PM.

Mr Carbosiero - whose 30-year career has been hailed as ‘an inspiration to the industry’ by colleagues - believes he was honoured for his campaign to get hairdressing recognised as a profession. Asked about his approach to the PM’s hairstyle he said: ‘I just did what felt natural.’

However, Mr Tahir remains unconvinced. ‘I see Mr Cameron on TV and I’m not sure about  his hair,’ he said. ‘I don’t think he’s looking after it as well as he could.'
