British taxpayers could be forced to stump up another £5billion to rescue Spain as the crisis in the eurozone spirals out of control.

Fears are mounting that Madrid will have to ask for an emergency bailout of up to £300billion as it struggles to prop up its basket-case banks.

A third of that money could come from the International Monetary Fund – including around £5billion from the UK, even though Britain is not in the eurozone.

UK taxpayers have already coughed up £12.5billion to rescue debt-ridden Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

Spain’s deputy prime minister Soraya 
Saenz de Santamaria has held crunch talks in Washington with IMF chief 
Christine Lagarde and US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

But the IMF denied reports that it 
has started to plan a bailout for Spain, while the country’s finance 
minister insisted it was stable.

‘The IMF is not drawing up plans that
involve financial assistance for Spain, nor has Spain requested any 
financial support from the IMF,’ said the fund’s spokesman Gerry Rice.

But growing doubts over how the 
Spanish government will finance the £15billion needed to rescue Bankia, 
one of its biggest lenders, have raised fears that it will follow 
Ireland, Greece and Portugal in requiring a bailout from Europe and the 
IMF.

This week US investment bank JP Morgan warned a joint rescue of Spain could cost around £300billion.

The Spanish banking system has been crippled by nearly £150billion in toxic property loans.

Meanwhile, as Bankia announced a loss
of £2.6billion, it emerged that its top bosses had enjoyed a pay 
bonanza totalling £18million.

Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat 
peer, said: ‘It would be beyond belief if we had to help pay for Spanish
so-called bankers who have run Bankia on to the rocks.’

Lagarde called her meeting with Saenz de Santamaria productive. She also denied a Wall Street Journal report that the IMF was drawing up plans for a rescue loan for Spain.

Saenz de Santamaria said that she discussed with Geithner some of the ideas being discussed in Europe about how to set up a fund to recapitalise European banks.

She said: 'The problem is not Spain as a country. But our financial system in a given moment has needs just like the other states had at other times.'

Eurozone unemployment has hit a record high and job losses are likely to keep climbing as the debt crisis eats away at businesses' ability to hire workers while indebted governments continue to cut staff.

Around 17.4million people were out of work in the 17-nation eurozone in April (11 per cent of the working population) - the highest level since records began in 1995, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said today.

'This 11 percent level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year,' said Francois Cabau, an economist at Barclays Capital who sees the eurozone's economy contracting 0.1 per cent this year.

'The economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market. There's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year and indicators are pointing to very weak growth momentum for the second quarter,' he said.

ING economist Martin van Vliet said he sees the unemployment rate reaching slightly above 11.5 per cent if the economy starts to recover later this year. But if the downturn worsens, 'the risk is for an even higher peak in unemployment,' he said.

As the debt crisis intensifies, companies in the euro zone are trying to keep their labour costs low as they struggle with falling demand and profits, while a German-led drive to cut deficits and debt is pressuring governments to shrink spending.

But some economists say austerity policies in an economic downturn are self-defeating because governments receive less tax receipts as unemployment grows and must pay out more money in jobless benefits.

The denial comes as senior European 
officials last night issued a grave warning that the very survival of 
the euro is at risk as the crisis in Spain threatens to tear the region 
apart.

Politicians and 
central bankers said the situation in the eurozone was unsustainable and
drastic action was needed to prevent the ‘disintegration’ of the single
currency.

They spoke out as European leaders 
scrambled to stop the financial crisis in Spain spiralling out of 
control and infecting other countries such as Italy.

The
euro crashed to a 23-month low against the US dollar at $1.2335 but was
up slightly against sterling having recovered from its lowest level 
since late 2008. Last night, £1 was worth €1.2460.

Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said the eurozone was unsustainable in its current form.

In his sharpest criticism yet of eurozone leaders’ handling of the crisis, he said the European Central Bank could not ‘fill the vacuum’ left by governments in terms of economic growth or structural reforms.

And he called for overwhelming force to be used to shore up Europe’s battered banks to restore confidence in the financial system.

Ignazio Visco, governor of the Bank of Italy and a senior ECB member, said political inertia and bad economic decisions have put ‘the entire European edifice’ at risk.

‘There are growing doubts among international investors about governments’ ability to ensure the survival of the single currency,’ he said.

Olli Rehn, EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said bold action was required ‘if we want to avoid a disintegration of the eurozone’.

The apocalyptic tone from usually measured EU officials betrayed the spreading sense of panic.

Irish voters are likely to approve a European treaty on budget discipline in yesterday’s referendum – securing continued aid.

The result will be announced later today.

But the outcome of a second Greek election on June 17 – seen as crucial for the country’s future in the eurozone – is too close to call.
