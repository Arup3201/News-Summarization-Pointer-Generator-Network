The famous red and white spacesuit worn by Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy is up for auction , with an estimated price-tag of up to $20,000

The famous red and white spacesuit worn by Robin Williams in hit 1970s TV series Mork and Mindy is up for auction next month, with an estimated price-tag of up to $20,000.

Also on sale will be the 'egg' in which alien Mork traveled to earth from Ork in the breakthrough series for Williams.

The Mrs Doubtfire actor was found dead at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area last month in an apparent suicide aged 63.

'This is such a big piece from a pop-culture, television history perspective,' Brian Chanes of the Profiles in History auction house told AFP.

'I think that it's going to stand on its own merit, not because of what recently, tragically, happened with Robin,' he added.

The Mork spacesuit -- thought to be the only one ever to come up for public auction -- is estimated to fetch $15,000-$20,000, while the egg-spaceship could go for between $4,000 and $6,000.

The items will go on sale at an auction of Hollywood memorabilia to be held from October 17-20 at the auction house in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles. 

The 63-year-old actor portrayed Mork, an alien from the planet Ork in the hit show which ran from 1978 to 1982 . 

Brian Chanes, Profiles in History consignor and client relations specialist, told Yahoo TV that the space suit was originally released by Paramount in the 1980s and has been kept in a private collection until recently.

'This was part of Paramount's wardrobe for years, and it went into a collection and now it's being released to the public,' Chanes said. 

'We're very pleased to have that, because it's not only just a great piece of Robin Williams memorabilia, but it is a piece of television history.'

He said the egg that is up for auction is not the one seen in opening credits of the sitcom which was was big enough for Williams to climb inside - this egg was used for other purposes on the series.

'This one was one of the transports, and it was used in the pilot episode,' he said.

'And then they used the flip side for other instances when an egg was coming or going, because that's how they would transport things, through these teleport eggs.'

Earlier this year Williams and his Mork and Mindy co-star Pam Dawber were reunited in his CBS comedy The Crazy Ones.

In The Crazy Ones, Robin starred alongside Buffy actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played his uptight daughter, and the pair took to the stage in May 2013 to sell the show to advertisers at the annual TV Upfronts.

The actor soon had advertisers eating out of the palm of his hand as the session descended into one of his trademark frenetic stand-up routines.

He joked about strippers and likened the upfronts to the Westminster Kennel Club dog show 'but with more agents, and a little less ass-sniffing'.

Robin Williams and Pam Dawber starred alongside each other in 1980s comedy series 

As Robin reminded them, 'It’s been a long time since I’ve been on TV, 30 years, when there were much simpler upfronts - and a mound of coke.'

As filming started Williams seemed to be back on form, posting pictures from the set on Twitter and Instagram.

The series debuted to stellar ratings, with 15.6 million viewers it was the most-watched series premiere of the fall. 

However, viewers deserted the show and on May 10, CBS announced it was not picking up the show for a second season.

This news is believed to have left Robin reeling. 

Indeed, weeks after the show was cancelled, Robin, who had struggled with alcoholism for decades and battled cocaine abuse in the 1980s, checked into rehab at the Hazeldon Addiction Treatment Center in Minnesota.
