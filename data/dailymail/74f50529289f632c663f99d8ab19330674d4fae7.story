Ever since he turned professional Rory McIlroy has passed away the time on his first flight each year by marking down his goals for the season on the back of his boarding pass.

And while the seat numbers have got progressively lower — this year’s targets are written on the back of 1A — his targets are now so sky-high he didn’t even tick them all off last season, when he won two majors.

‘Still a pretty good year, though,’ he said, with tongue firmly in cheek.

This year the list extends to seven items and while he has no intention of making them public — that really would be making a rod for his own back — you can be pretty sure that the first two will be to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters in April and defend his Open title in July on his favourite course, St Andrews.

‘The boarding pass stays in the wallet and then on the last flight of the year I take it out and see how well I’ve done,’ he said.

‘I’ve never managed to achieve all my goals in any year, so I aim pretty high. But it’s good to see the seat numbers are coming down. It was 13B and then 12A and so on and now it’s down to 1A. I guess the ultimate goal is to have a boarding pass with no seat number on it at all.’

If truth be told, McIlroy is now comfortably in the income bracket where he could fly the world by private jet, and invariably does for anything but long-haul flights. But there is one blot on the horizon threatening to blow a nasty hole in that wallet, both in terms of income and his season’s goals. 

McIlroy is hoping to go even better this year than his Open and US PGA Championship wins of 2014

It concerns the bitter court case looming with his former management company Horizon Sports. McIlroy is both suing and being countersued, with the result being he is likely to spend a good deal of next month in a Dublin courtroom, including a lengthy spell on the witness stand.

Given what is at stake — McIlroy stands to lose tens of millions of pounds if the judgment goes against him — you might think it has the potential to be a serious distraction with the Masters just around the corner.

If so, McIlroy did a pretty good job of disguising it.

‘Why would it distract me?’ he said. ‘I’ve just got to get up there and tell the truth. I’ve literally not thought about it since whenever it was that I last had to talk to someone about it. It’s no big deal. I will be OK at the end of the day.’

In fact, when it comes to distractions regarding the Masters, when he will be trying to win a third successive major, he is more wary of the hype that will inevitably grow as the big week draws closer.

To that end, he will change his routine of playing the week before at the Houston Open. Aware he would hardly get a moment’s peace, Plan A will now see him play in the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida in mid-March instead, giving him a fortnight away from the spotlight to prepare for Augusta. ‘It might change in the sense if I feel I need some tournament golf I will definitely go to Houston, but that’s my thinking at the minute,’ said McIlroy. 

Also in his thinking is starting the year off with a victory. For the eighth year in a row, McIlroy is kicking off here at the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship, which starts on Thursday, and a rare furrow creases his brow when he recalls the various self-inflicted ways he has managed to keep himself out of the winner’s circle.

Winning The Masters at Augusta is 25-year-old's primary objective this season

Take last year, when he picked up the daftest of two-shot penalties for failing to take full relief from ground under repair and lost out to Pablo Larrazabal. Or 2012, when another two-shot penalty for brushing away sand that was not on the green cost him the trophy.

‘Keeping the right side of the rule book would certainly help,’ was McIlroy’s laconic response. ‘I definitely feel like there’s some unfinished business with this tournament, and I’m looking forward to getting out there. After what I achieved last year, I feel like I am going into this season with momentum.’

Not to mention a golden ticket containing a seven-point plan to rule the world once more.
