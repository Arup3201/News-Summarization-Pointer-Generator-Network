ABC News correspondent Mara Schiavocampo has written about how she lost an impressive 90lbs, revealing her 'formula for lasting success'.

In her new book, Thinspired: How I Lost 90 Pounds - My Plan for Lasting Weight Loss and Self-Acceptance, the mother-of-one, 35, says her weight-loss is largely thanks to diet, though sleep and exercise also played a part.

In an article about the book on ABCNews.com, she wrote: 'This seems obvious, but what you eat and how much, is the single biggest factor in weight loss. Period. You will never exercise your way out of a bad diet.

'Conversely, if you make the right food choices, you can lose weight without any exercise at all,’ she explained. ‘Don’t get me wrong, exercise is really good for you, for a number of reasons. But it plays a much smaller role in weight loss than so many of us believe.'

Ms Schiavocampo has been married to husband Tommie Porter since 2005 and the couple welcomed daughter Nina Isabella Porter three years ago.

She says she 'desperately' wanted to lose the 40lbs she gained during her pregnancy - especially because she had already been 50lbs overweight beforehand.

But having been ridiculed for her weight as a child and later suffering from an eating disorder in her twenties, she admits she struggled with a 'tortured and complicated' relationship with food for years.

'I love sugar so much I have literally poured it down my throat,' she admitted.

She found that the key was to eliminate all processed foods, flour and dairy, and adopt a diet of fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, beans, nuts and whole grains.

'Once I made that change, losing weight felt like rolling downhill,' she said.

Ms Schiavocampo also advises getting seven to nine hours of sleep, noting that it's easier to have strong willpower around food when you're well-rested.

She also emphasized the importance of planning meals, making sure to stock your kitchen with groceries and schedule time to cook.

As for exercise, she enjoys spin classes at SoulCycle and interval training at Barry’s Bootcamp.

'Find an activity you love. You may have to kiss a lot of frogs, but find that sweaty prince!' she wrote.

Ms Schiavocampo, who lives in New York City, was previously an anchor for NBC's Early Day and for MSNBC's First Look.
