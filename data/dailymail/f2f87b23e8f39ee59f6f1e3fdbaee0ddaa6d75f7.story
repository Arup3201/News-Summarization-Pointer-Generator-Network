The number of stop and searches carried out by the Metropolitan Police is set to fall dramatically as the force aims to improve its relationship with the black community.

Scotland Yard confirmed today that Section 60 orders, which permit random stop and searches, are set to be cut by half.

The decision comes after Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard 
Hogan-Howe described random searches as 'a real challenge' for the force.

Changes: The number of stop and searches carried out by Metropolitan Police officers is set to fall by half in a bid to improve relations with the black community

A spokesman said: 'The aim is to decrease the number of times senior officers grant authority for stop and searches.

'It could be that there are just as many stops but they'll be more effective.'

Figures currently show that more than 90 per cent of stoppages fail to lead to arrest.

Chiefs have outlined new targets that aim to halve the number of times they fail to find drugs during searches, while raising the arrest rate to 20 per cent.

Decision: Bernard Hogan-Howe previously described stop and search as 'a real challenge' and has now signed off the new approach

The debate into the success of the searches has raged for years among politicians, police and the communities.

Critics say it alienates young people in ethnic minority communities, while supporters say the tactic is a deterrent to rising youth violence and teenage murders.

The Metropolitan Police spokesman added: 'Last year, there were 1,753 Section 60 authorities.

'Within these 1,753 authorities, there were around 51,000 searches.

'If we raise the threshold for a Section 60, we might not necessarily see fewer searches.

'It could be that there's a stronger case to do a S60 authority and in that authority, we do search more people.

'It is the number of authorities that is being targeted.'

Mr Hogan-Howe has signed off the 'implementation of a new approach which will see a dedicated, experienced central team lead a wide range of changes affecting every element of stop and search with the aim of improving policy, practice and performance across the board.'

The force added: 'This new approach will see a renewed focus on reducing violence, as this is one of the key issues communities tell us they want us to tackle, as well as an enhancement of our intelligence-led targeting.

'We will aim to be more effective by increasing positive outcomes across key categories from arrest rates to seizures of weapons.'
