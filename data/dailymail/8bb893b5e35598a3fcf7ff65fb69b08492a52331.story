A 21 stone woman gave birth to a baby boy four hours after doctors revealed she was expecting, her size having disguised her pregnancy for a staggering 38 weeks.

Sophie Bird was a size 24 when in September 2010, she was preparing to be bridesmaid at her best friend's wedding.

In the months leading up to the big day, Miss Bird had visited the doctor 10 times, complaining of indigestion, stomach ache and nausea.

But nobody spotted she was pregnant.

Four hours after doctors told Sophie Bird she was pregnant she was cradling baby Rowan in her arms, having been rushed to A&E, where medics revealed the stomach pain she was experiencing was, in fact, labour

In the months leading up to her friend's wedding, where Miss Bird was to be bridesmaid, the 21 stone 29-year-old visited the doctors around 10 times complaining of stomach aches, nausea and indigestion. But due to her size, no one spotted she was pregnant

Two days after the wedding, and suffering severe stomach pain, Miss Bird visited the doctors once more.

A test confirmed she was pregnant, and the expectant mother was referred straight to A&E where an examination revealed she was 4cm dilated and in labour.

Four hours later, the new mother was cradling baby Rowan in her arms.

She said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life, I was completely stunned.

'I had managed to carry a baby without changing shape or size for nearly nine months.

'I had been fitted for my bridesmaids dress in May and the dress still fitted in September - just before I gave birth.'

As a child, Miss Bird had been a big eater, but exercised regularly and maintained her weight at around 14 stone.

When she left school, a daily diet of takeaways and alcohol saw her weight spiral to 19 stone.

'I actually got stretch marks from putting weight on so quickly,' she said.

When she was 17, Miss Bird met her partner Carl. Together they spent evenings on the sofa watching TV and eating takeaways.

In the next seven years their relationship fell into a rut, and Miss Bird turned to food to numb the pain. At 21 stone, and needed size 24 clothes.

Miss Bird, who has since lost eight stone and aims to shed two more, said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life, I was completely stunned. I had managed to carry a baby without changing shape or size for nearly nine months'

'At
 various points in my life, I’ve tried to lose weight,' she said. 'I think I’ve 
tried every diet going - Weight Watchers, 5:2 and Atkins.

'They all worked for a while, but none of them were sustainable, so whatever weight I lost, it all piled back on, and more.

'I would look at myself in the mirror and feel numb. I could look after, and be kind to other people, but not myself.

'I started acting like a clown around my friends to cover up the sadness I had inside.

'I was really unhappy and that made me want to eat more and more.

'I wore a tent every day to cover myself up. I never felt normal or attractive. I used to say to myself; my life is about quiet resignation now - this is as much as I can expect.'

'It was the biggest shock of my life, I was completely stunned. I had managed to carry a baby without changing shape or size for nearly nine months'

In the months leading up to her friend Aimee's wedding in 2010, Miss Bird said she visited the doctor about 10 times, complaining of indigestion, stomach ache and nausea.'

I was on the pill, and as a child I’d been diagnosed with polycystic ovaries - they told me I’d need help to conceive, so it never dawned on me that I could be pregnant,' she said.

'Two days after Aimee’s wedding, I was in so much pain at lunchtime that I rang the doctor and made an appointment for 5pm.

'This time, the doctor did a pregnancy test and confirmed I was pregnant, but no-one knew how many weeks.

'The doctor sent me of to A&E where I had an internal examination. I was told I was 4cm dilated and in full labour.

'Straight away a porter put me in a wheelchair and pushed me across the car park, at some crazy speed, to the maternity unit.

'It was all nuts, I couldn’t believe what was happening.'

Miss Bird said she had no idea she was pregnant. She was on the pill and had been told by doctors she suffered polysystic ovaries, and as a result would struggle to get pregnant. She said having been fitted for her bridesmaids dress in May 2010, no adjustments were needed by the wedding in September, just two days before Rowan was born

The now 32-year-old gave birth to baby Rowan on September 22, 2010

A Malory Band is a narrow, adjustable cord that is worn around the waist.

It feels tighter as you eat, making people more aware of the amount of food they are eating.

The band was designed as a psychological gastric band, which acts as an alarm bell warning slimmers not to over eat.

The brainchild of former Rally Driving Champion and TV presenter Penny Mallory, the device can also improve posture, encouraging its wearer to sit and stand taller to avoid the tension of the band when slouching.

It is versatile and can be work all day, every day, even in the shower or swimming pool/

Malory Band also helps maintain the weight a person has lost - as the band starts to feel tighter, it becomes an early warn sign that the pounds might be creeping back on.

The band has a unique button-hole system, allowing it to be made smaller as you lose the inches.

You can stop the inches creeping back on by continuing to wear the band - so your weight loss product turns into your weight maintenance programme.

It is available in various sizes and can be decorated with clip-on charms that mark your progress.

Four hours after learning she was pregnant, baby Rowan was born at 9pm.

She said: 'It was completely surreal. One minute my life was normal, next minute I had a beautiful little baby boy.

'I had no baby stuff so my friends and family rallied round to get me all the baby equipment - they were amazing.'

But it was eight months later, on her 30th birthday, that Miss Bird discovered her boyfriend was having an affair with her best friend.

'It completely broke me,' she said. 'I kicked him out and was so traumatised and so stressed by it all that I couldn’t face eating.

'I felt constantly sick, and as a result my size started to shrink.

'I knew that this was the right time to get control back of my life, my body, my mind and my eating.

'I set my mind to losing the weight and vowed never, ever put it back on.

'Over the next few years I took up Morris Dancing and Roller Derby to keep active.

'I also joined the gym and made sure I did some form of exercise every day.

'I changed my diet to fresh, healthy food and limited my portion size. The weight started to drop off me. I lost 5 stone and was feeling fantastic - energised, happy and confident.'

In May, a friend told Miss Bird about Malory Band, a new way to monitor and motivate weight loss.

The device is a narrow cord that sits around the waist and starts to feel tighter as a person eats.

It acts as a 'psychological alarm bell', triggering the brain to think about the amount of food it needs.

Miss
 Bird, who has lost eight stone and plans to shed another two stone by 
next summer, said: 'It was just what I needed. I wish I had known about 
it before. 

'I love it because it’s not a diet. I 
make all the decisions about what I eat and my Malory Band reminds me 
when I have had enough to eat. It’s so simple and so effective - 
everyone should have one.

Eight months after Rowan was born, Miss Bird's weight loss was kick started after she discovered her boyfriend had been having an affair with her best friend

The 32-year-old who has lost eight stone to date, credits her weight loss to a device known as a Malory Band - a cord around the waist, pictured,  that acts as a psychological gastric band, reminding people when they are full

'When I started wearing the Malory Band, it would start to feel tight when I ate, and so I'd stop eating.

'It made me realise I didn't need to carry on eating, and the weight came off so quickly.

'I was still having a healthy diet, but the band was literally reining me in and making me constantly aware of what I was putting into my body.

'I can't express how happy I am about losing the weight. I have more confidence and energy and am a much happier person.

'Before, I'd go out with my friends and just want to hide away as they were all so slim and healthy.

'I feel alive and I am so much happier. And of course, now I have my wonderful Rowan, he’s the sunshine in my life.'

And she has vowed never to watch as the weight piles back on.

'I guarantee you won't ever see me that size again,' she added.

'My Malory Band is like a best friend that supports me and stays with me constantly, and it will help me to lose another two stone. I know the weight will never return.'
