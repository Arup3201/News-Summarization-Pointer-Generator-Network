Tragic: Veteran ice climber Jack Roberts, 58, suffered a heart attack after plunging from the Bridal Veil Ice Falls near Telluride, Colorado, on Sunday

San Miguel County Sheriff Bill 
Masters told the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel: 'It’s not easy to 
access. You have to traverse the canyon and a fair amount of ice to get 
there, and we had to access it all by snow machine.

'The fellow he was with did the best 
he could. Mr Roberts was conscious for an hour or so, but his injuries 
were just too severe.'

Eighteen rescuers responded to the 
climbers' distress call and spent 40 minutes trying to revive Mr 
Roberts, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Bridal Veil Ice Falls is 365ft high and is regarded as one of the most difficult ice climbs in the U.S.

Mr Roberts appreciated how tough the waterfall could be to climb.

Expert in his field: Mr Roberts had been a climber for more than 40 years and wrote numerous magazine articles on the sport, as well as the 2005 book Colorado Ice

In a video posted on YouTube three 
years ago, he said: 'It offers the climber the opportunity to climb just
 about anywhere on its surface, and experience climbing in a very unique
 and special way that becomes more personal than if you’re on the rock.'

Mr Roberts, who lived in Boulder, Colorado, had been a climber for more than 40 years.

He wrote numerous magazine articles on the sport, as well as the 2005 book Colorado Ice, and was also a guide and instructor.

He is survived by a wife, who was overseas when she was informed of Sunday's accident.
