It was intended to her portray her as an ordinary mom, keen to make savings for her family.

But Michelle Obama's casual slip-out trip to Target is being met with scepticism, as media personalities deride the ‘incognito’ visit as a well-timed PR stunt.

Only last month the First Lady was accused of indulging in luxury holidays worth $10million dollars on the tax payers’ dime.

And barely a week ago, the 47-year-old mother-of-two was criticised for wearing $40,000 diamonds to a fund-raising event.

But with Obama’s domestic popularity at one
of its lowest ebbs, she seems determined to her fight her husband's 
re-election battle by her self-proclaimed campaign wife motto of ‘Do no 
harm'.

Showing the world that she really can do recession chic, Mrs Obama headed to a Target store in Alexandria, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon.

Secret Service officers reportedly swept the store on Highway 1, 30 minutes before Mrs Obama popped in for her housewives' essentials- dog food and cleaning products.

Wearing a Nike baseball cap, sunglasses and a floral-print button-down shirt, the glamorous mother walked in 
through the main entrance with just one assistant, an unknown female aide.

The fashionable lawyer spent about 30 minutes 
minutes shopping, pushing her own trolley. She was recognised only by the 
cashier who rang up her purchases, Today reported.

Maria Panagopulos, a store manager at
the Target in Alexandria, told NBC News claimed the store was given no 
advance notice about the first lady’s visit.

Mrs Obama checked
out at around 3.30 pm she said, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, were 
not with her.

'People did not approach her, she was
very incognito,' Maria Panagopulof told CNN. 'We didn't realize truly 
what was happening until she had almost left. The cashier recognised 
her, but she was very unassuming.'

'We did not have advance notice; it was as big a
surprise to us as it was to everyone else.'

The White House confirmed that it was indeed the First Lady.

'It is not uncommon for the First Lady to slip out to run an errand, eat
at a local restaurant or otherwise enjoy the city outside the White 
House gates,' a spokesman told CBS News.

One of the mother-of-two's more memorable 'slip outs' was to DC's BLT Steak 
restaurant in April, when hockey superstar Alex Ovechkin tweeted a photo
of himself with his arm around the First Lady.

Target also tweeted Mrs. Obama's visit to their store.

'First Lady Michelle Obama may be incognito but there is no denying 
those signature @Target red carts!' was tweeted from the @Bullseyeview 
account. @Target retweeted it.

Mrs Obama seemed at pains to appear 
extra down to earth by pushing her own cart and carrying her own 
shopping bags, examiner.com reported.

Associated Press photographer Charles Dharapak caught a few images of Mrs Obama reaching the check out.

But conservative blogger Michelle Malkin mocked the idea that it was a chance meeting as, 'snortalicious'.

Malkin blogged: 'She left the bling at home. But her shirt and sunglasses are 
about as "incognito” as Lady Gaga’s outfit at her younger sister’s 
graduation.'

Radio host Rush Limbaugh also denounced the visit on his show as a 'photo-op'.He said: 'It has gotten so bad they had to send Moochelle out there in a Lady Gaga-type getup,'

'What a phony baloney plastic banana good time rock-and-roller optic photo op this was!'

'You think the AP has photographers waiting outside stores for Moochelle to show up?" Limbaugh asked. "Who do they think we are?'

On his Twitter profile photographer Dharapak names the White House as one of his beats.

And only on Monday the photographer had taken pictures of Mrs Obama inside the 
White House as she made an announcement about womens' STEM career 
issues.

Certainly the White House have not so far denied that Dharapak was tipped off.

After shopping for around 40 minutes she reportedly left the store with towels and cleaning supplies, according to Today.

Alongside the humble groceries were dog food and treats for First Dog Bo, People magazine reported.

Of course, the possibility that Mrs 
Obama was in fact trying the get the last of the Missoni 
Target collaboration cannot be ruled out.

But she reportedly left without a bargain from the Italian designer, Business Insider reported.

Michelle has a long standing relationship with Target, declaring in 2008 that she as more target than Walmart.

A year later she was spotted wearing a Target dress, as she left Air Force Once with daughter Sasha.

And only in May she told Oprah Winfrey that she missed casual shopping trips from her life before the White House. 'I can't go to Target and walk around. I guess I could but it would mess up everyone else's shopping experience.'

The shopping trip will be a slap in the face for Target's biggest competitor Walmart.

As part of her campaign to beat childhood obesity the First Lady has formed
a partnership for the Let's Move! campaign with Walmart, who, unlike Target, have promised to cut down on salt, sugar and fat in their food, the Foodorama blog 
reported

Mrs Obama is currently involved in a major fund-raising effort in the run-up to her husband's re-election campaign.

But she will have to work hard to counter her spendthrift reputation. In August White House sources claimed that the First Lady has spent $10million of U.S. taxpayers' money on vacations in the past year.

Calling the 47-year-old mother-of-two a ’vacation junkie’ they described her  penchant for five-star hotels, where she splashes out expensive treats such as  massages.

The 'top source' told the National Enquirer: 'It's disgusting. Michelle is taking advantage of her privileged position while the most hard-working Americans can barely afford a week or two off work.

'When it's all added up, she's spent more than $10million in taxpayers' money on her vacations.'

The source continued: 'The vacations are totally Michelle's idea. She's like a junkie. She can't schedule enough getaways, and she lives from one to the next - all the while sticking it to hard-working Americans.'
