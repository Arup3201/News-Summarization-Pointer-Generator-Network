If you have stared into your cup of black coffee to wonder why there is often a misty white layer just below its surface that ripples and breaks apart, you are not alone.

Physicists have investigated the membrane, which was first identified by scientists in the 1920s, to find that it’s made up of tiny water droplets that float beneath the liquid’s surface and form a triangular lattice, which creates the ‘mist’.

Measuring just 20 micrometres across, the droplets fall from above the water surface like rain before they are trapped.

Physicists have investigated the strange 'misty' white layer just below the surface of a cup of coffee (illustrated with a stock picture) to find that it’s made up of tiny water droplets that float beneath the liquid’s surface and form a triangular lattice, which creates the ‘mist’

Researchers at Kyoto University and Kyushu University in Japan carried out the first modern study in to the strange phenomenon, Physics arXiv Blog reported.

‘Very few people appear to have imagined such fascinating phenomena happening in a teacup,’ they said.

Using a camera placed underneath a water bath, they discovered that the ‘mist’ can be seen on tea and any hot water over 50°C (122°F) - it’s just not as visible as it is in black coffee.

Filming the process, they discovered that the droplets fall from above and that occasionally droplets in a certain part of a cup - or water bath - vanish, causing the misty membrane to break apart.

The researchers used a camera capable of 8,000 frames a second to film the action to show that the cracks appear at a speed of one metre per second and are accompanied by a wave moving across the surface of the coffee, just below the membrane.

While they may have solved some questions about the strange mist, they are not certain on some of the details.

Takahiro Umeki and his team believe that droplets may be charged, allowing them to form a triangular lattice in areas of the cup that are packed with the minuscule bubbles.

But they are not sure whether an electrostatic force causes them to levitate.

They think that the droplets could be levitated by a flow of evaporating particles from the water’s surface, but this is just a guess. 

They did however, find that the membrane cracks at the same speed as the tiny waves below the surface of the water, suggesting that the droplets are being swamped by a wave as it ripples along.

The physicists have calculated that such a wave would need to be be high enough to catch a small population of droplets, causing some of them to burst and the surface of the membrane to break apart.

They even say that cracks may occur because of a single water droplet triggering a wave that spreads. 

Whether there is a membrane on your coffee or not, a study released in Novemeber claimed that the drink could protect against dementia.

Drinking between three and five cups a day could cut the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by up to 20 per cent, scientists said.

Nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills, especially during the phase of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms of dementia occur.

This is according to a report published by the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, who are funded by major European coffee companies such as Illycaffè, Nestlé and DE Master Blenders.

Research suggests that compounds called polyphenols are responsible for this protective effect; compounds also found in high quantities in coffee.

Other studies cited in the report found regular, life-long moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

But experts from leading charities Alzheimer's Research UK and Alzheimer's society warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent Alzheimer's, because no clinical trials have been carried out.

While they claim tiny waves may cause the membrane to break, they are unsure why the droplets levitate below the liquid's surface

Similar membranes form on hot water above 50°C, but can't always be seen
