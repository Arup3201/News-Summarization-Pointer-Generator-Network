The last living man to have been born in the 19th century has died at the age of 116.

Jiroemon Kimura, who was born on April 19, 1897, was not only the world's oldest person but also the world's oldest ever living man.

The former postman died in his hospital bed in Kyotango, Japan where he had been undergoing treatment for pneumonia.

Mr Kimura had been officially recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living person and the oldest man ever.

What an innings: Jiroemon Kimura, the world's oldest person and the oldest ever man is pictured with one of his 15 great-great-grandchildren in Kyotango, western Japan, where he died today

After living through two world wars, Mr Kimura went on to live another 68 years. He once attributed his longevity to getting out in the sunlight

According to Guinness, Mr Kimura, a former postman, was the first man in history to have lived to 116 years old. 

He is survived by seven children, 14 
grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren, and 15 great-great-grandchildren,
Japanese media said.

The oldest living man is officially 111-year-old American James McCoubrey, who was born on September 13, 1901.

However a great-grandfather living in Britain has disputed this claiming he is 113.

Ghahreman Pardis's Iranian birth 
certificate says he was born on November 2, 1903, making him 109  but 
his family say his papers were doctored twice so he could dodge national
service. 

They say he was actually born in 1899, which makes him 113 years and 69 days old.

His true age became masked when Mr 
Pardis faced conscription as a teenager in Turkey where he was as a 
leading boxer, his relatives claim.

Mr Kimura is congratulated by Kyotango City Mayor Yasushi Nakayama as he celebrates his 116th birthday at his home on April 19

Government chiefs wanted to keep the 
sporting champion so they altered his passport to show his birthday as 
two years later - in 1901 - ensuring he would not be drafted.

Then during his 20s Mr Pardis moved 
to Iran where he became a sports coach and key figure building sports 
facilities in the country.

Iranian officials were so impressed 
with his role in the country they too altered his date of birth by two 
years so he could avoid joining the army.

The death of Mr Kiruma comes just a few days after
that of a woman in China who claimed to be 127, which would have made 
her the real record holder by a wide margin.

Luo Meizhen lived in Bama county in China's Guangxi region's - an area famous for the longevity of its residents.

Her
ID card stated she was born in 1885, but she does not have a birth 
certificate to prove this so her claim was never officially recognised.

If
Ms Luo was truly 127, it would make her the oldest person ever to have 
lived, beating Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 aged 122.

Mr
Kimura became the oldest man ever on Dec. 28, 2012, at the age of 115 
years, 253 days, breaking the record set by Christian Mortensen, a 
Danish immigrant to the United States, whose life spanned from 
1882-1998.

A nun believed to hold the world record of 86 years cloistered in a monastery has died in Spain aged 105.

Sister Maria Romero, abbess of the Buenafuente del Sistal monastery outside Madrid said that Sister Teresita Barajuen had died overnight.

She entered the Cistercian monastery when she was 19, the abbess said.

Sister Teresita acknowledged in interviews that like many young women at the time, she never intended being a nun but entered the monastery because of family pressure.

In 2011 she left the monastery for the first time in 40 years to meet now-retired Benedict XVI during a papal visit to Madrid.

She had entered the monastery on the same day he was born.

The title of oldest living person is now held by another Japanese person, 115-year-old Misao Okawa, of Osaka.

Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records said: 'Jiroemon Kimura was an exceptional person.

'As
the only man to have ever lived for 116 years — and the oldest man 
whose age has been fully authenticated — he has a truly special place in
world history.'

Kyotango officials said Mr Kimura's funeral would be held Friday.

The town's mayor Mayor Yasushi 
Nakayamasaid: 'Mr Kimura was and will always be a treasure to our town, 
to our country and to our world.'

On his 115th birthday, Mr Kimura had attributed his longevity to getting out in the sunlight.

'I am always looking up towards the sky. That is how I am,'

According to local media, Kimura ate a three-meal-a-day diet of rice, pumpkins and sweet potatoes.

He reportedly did not smoke and said he only ate until he felt 80 per cent full.

According to one town official his motto in life  was 'to eat light and live long'.

He celebrated his 116th birthday on April 19 by watching a video message of congratulations from Japan's prime minister.

When he was born back in 1897, Japan was coming to the end of its feudal period which saw the final days of the Samurai warrior class and the birth of a modern imperialist state.

When Japan entered WWI on the side of the British in 1915 he was already 18 years old, and when it allied itself with Germany in 1940 at the start of WWII he was already pushing on 43.

When the U.S. dropped the bomb on Hiroshima he was 48 but he resumed work as a postman at the end of the war and went on to live for another 68 years.

Japan has more than 50,000 centenarians, 2011 government data showed, reinforcing its reputation for longevity.
