A great grandfather has made a claim as Britain's longest-serving church chorister, after singing in the same choir for 83 years.

Richard Henry, 90, joined the St Mary’s Roman Catholic Church Male Voice Choir in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, as a boy soprano at the age of just seven in 1928.

When his voice broke he developed a fine tenor voice and has spent the last eight decades performing a variety of music including church pieces, classical masterpieces and his favourite Gilbert and Sullivan numbers.

Now as the 99-year old choir celebrates its centenary year, colleagues have hailed Mr Henry as 'the father of the choir'.

Former engineer Richard, a widower, said: 'When I was at school, the choirmaster back then was the music teacher. I was pressed to join and I’ve been in it ever since.

'Some people think it’s wonderful but it is just something I have always enjoyed doing.

'I never think about how long it has been because it’s something I have always been used to doing - although I can’t sing like I used to. They are putting up with me now.

'The members of the choir have become my friends and we always socialise together. My family of two daughters, five grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren all come to listen to me sing, which is nice.'

'We find it difficult to recruit young men so it’s good to see this renewed interest in choirs. Hopefully that will help.'

The choir was formed in 1912 after the priest at the time felt it would it would be in keeping with the wish of Pope Pius X to reintroduce Latin plain chant into the liturgy.

Richard followed his Uncle Tom into the line up and sung alongside his brothers John and Tom.

Richard and his brothers formed The Henry Brothers singing group and were featured on Opportunity Knocks with Hughie Green in the 1960s. Richard was also a founder member of St Mary’s Operatic Society.

He was married to his late wife Gertrude for 62 years and has two daughters, five grandchildren, 13 great grandchildren and even one great, great grandchild.

His favourite song to sing is So Deep Is The Night, which uses the melody from Fridiric Chopin’s Tristesse.

Les Rushton, 71, the current deputy choirmaster said: 'We call Richard the father of the choir.

'He is loved by all the other members, many of whom have also been in the choir for 60 or 70 years. We threw the party for Richard because he has been so dedicated.

'It is a great example of commitment and devotion to the choir which he’s always held in great esteem. It’s a major part of his life.

'Richard is a shining example to anybody who likes choral singing. He is the epitome of what a dedicated chorister should be in this country.

'We believe we are the only Catholic male voice church choir in existence, because most churches of Christian religions have choirs but they are usually mixed

The combined age of all existing 23 members of the choir totals around 930, of which Richard is the oldest and the youngest is 18.
