A wacky new invention by British designer Patrick Morris is revolutionising the culinary kitchen experience - with herbs that hover over your head.

The upside down planters cleverly utilise redundant space in the kitchen and keep the fresh ingredients within arm's length.

Amongst the edible crops that thrive in the innovative holders include strawberries, fennel, mint, and parsley.

That's clever: British designer Patrick Morris is revolutionising the culinary kitchen experience - with herbs that hover over your head

Time saver: The plants only needs to be refilled once a fortnight

Once the plant has been placed inside the tub a circular lid is affixed on top, which acts as a barrier to stop water and soil leaking out when it is turned upside down.

A ceramic water holder gradually releases water into the plants slowly and it only needs to be refilled once a fortnight.

Morris's company Boskke are now 
struggling to keep up with demand for the ingenious pots as word spreads
through the culinary grapevine.
