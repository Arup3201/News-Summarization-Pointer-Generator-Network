A dig is underway on a Virginia mountainside for the remains of two young sisters who vanished as they walked home from a mall nearly 40 years ago.

Federal and state authorities began searching Taylor's Mountain on Monday morning for any signs of remains belonging to 10-year-old Katherine Lyon and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon.

The sisters had walked from their home in Kensington, Maryland to a mall in Wheaton for pizza and to visit the Easter exhibits on March 25, 1975. They were seen walking home to meet their 4pm curfew but never made it back and have not been seen since.

Last year, authorities named Richard Allen Welch Sr. and his nephew, Lloyd Lee Welch - a child sex offender serving time in Delaware - as persons of interest in the case.

Search: Investigators carry out a forensic dig on a central Virginia mountain on Monday to search for remains

Welch Sr., who is in his 70s, is believed to own or have owned property on Taylor's Mountain in Bedford, which is more than 230 miles from where the girls were last seen, CBS reported.

The 'forensic dig' is expected to last a couple of days, Bedford County Sheriff Mike Brown said.

A Federal Bureau of Investigation evidence recovery team, a Radford University forensic pathologist and state and local authorities are involved in the search.

Asked if it appears human remains will be found, Brown said: 'We would hope so.'

Other searches have been carried out on the mountain in recent months but Sheriff Brown said certain information and evidence had led them to a specific area. 

'The investigative work of this task force... will be as tenacious as humanly possible with the target of locating these children and providing the parents closure in this nightmare that no parents should be forced to endure,' Brown said. 

In October, Montgomery County Police Chief Russ Hamill said that authorities believed Richard Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area at the time of the disappearance.

Person of interest: Lloyd Lee Welch, 57, (pictured left around the time the girls disappeared and right in a recent mugshot) was at the mall the day the girls vanished and was seen paying attention to them

He is still alive and authorities say they know where he lives.

Welch Jr., now 57, was seen at the mall that day and witnesses said he was playing close attention to the girls, WUSA9 reported.

The man, whom police describe as a former ride operator for a carnival company and a drifter who traveled the U.S. and often stayed in homeless shelters between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s.

He has convictions in multiple states for raping young girls and has been locked up in Delaware since 1998 for sex offenses.

Neither man has been charged in the case, but Richard Welch's wife, Patricia Jean Welch of Hyattsville, Maryland, was indicted last month on a charge of lying to a grand jury. 

In October, a special grand jury was enrolled by the Bedford County Commonwealth's Attorney's office and is still hearing evidence in the case.

According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces.

Hopeful: Bedford County Sheriff Mike Brown said he hoped to find the girls' remains in the search

Investigation: Police can be seen heading towards the site on the mountain on Monday. Searches have been carried out in the area before but authorities said this time they have more specific information 

Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh.

The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon would be 50 years old.

In September, the girls' parents, who still live in the same area, asked for privacy.

Their father was a well-known radio presenter in the area and their elder brother Jay became a police officer after his sisters' disappearance. 

Bedford County Commonwealth's Attorney Randy Krantz urged any residents with information about the case to come forward.

'Our mission focus is to bring these children home if at all possible,' Krantz said.
