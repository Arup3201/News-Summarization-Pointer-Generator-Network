Sameer Babar, 35, from Luton, Bedfordshire, stabbed his neighbour Leonard Flower to death in an 'unexplained' attack

A religious fanatic who was unknowingly suffering from paranoid schizophrenia stabbed his neighbour to death in an 'unexplained and frenzied attack’.

Leonard Flower, 67, known as Len, was stabbed 17 times - including through the heart - by Sameer Babar, 35, as he was doing odd jobs in his garage in Luton, Bedfordshire.

His wife, Linda, to whom he had been married for 47 years, was just metres away inside the couple's home when the brutal attack took place.

But Mrs Flower only found out about her husband's death when he was found lying in a pool of blood by a couple who were delivering leaflets around the area.

During the hearing yesterday at Luton Crown Court, Babar denied murder, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

The court was told Babar, who lived opposite Mr 
Flower, a retired computer analyst, had fled the scene after carrying out the attack on October 22 last year by stealing the couple’s car.

He then drove north up the M1 motorway but was arrested five hours later in Kenilworth, Warwickshire.

Psychiatrists now believe Babar - who has written two books containing extreme religious rhetoric - was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in the years leading up to the attack.

He has now been detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Flower said she was 'heartbroken and devastated' about her husband's death.

She said: 'We have lost a good husband, father, grandfather and a kind man who was liked and respected by everyone who met him.'

Mr Flower, 67, was stabbed 17 times  as he worked in his garage. His wife Linda, to whom he had been married for 47 years, was just metres away in their home but had no idea what had happened

At the hearing, Judge Michael Kay QC said Babar's behaviour had been 'bizarre' in the year or two before the attack, but there had been no warning that he would be violent.

The court was told that Babar had written two books in 2011 and 2012 containing extreme religious rhetoric, which had led to angry reactions from local mosques.

Babar had also been planning to hold a lecture at Luton library and had been referred to a crisis mental health team, to be treated for depression, after contact with police.

The court was told that the defendant 
had even been visited by police the day before the killing but had refused to let
 them in. Police had no power of entry and were forced to leave.

The killing took place around 
lunchtime the next day.

Prosecutor Beverley 
Cripps said: 'The defendant was in the grip of mental 
illness, which has since been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia.

Babar, who lived opposite Mr Flower, fled the scene after stealing the couple's car but was later arrested in Kenilworth, Warwickshire

After Babar was found by police, he was detained in a mental health unit until the court case. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility

'He had been treated for depression but not significant mental illness.'

When Babar was arrested he was fit to be interviewed, the court was told. A month later he made a statement saying he had little memory of the day.

A
 psychiatrist who is now treating Babar told the court that Babar was probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia for a number of years, but it 
had not been diagnosed.

Judge Kay said: 'Words are inadequate to describe the extent of the tragedy which hit the Flower family completely out of the blue on October 22 last year.

'One’s 
heart goes out to that family. He was a good husband, father and 
grandfather, a man liked and respected by many people. Nothing anyone 
can do can put matters right.

Mrs Flower said her husband was 'kind, generous and caring' and that he was liked and respected by everyone he met

'There is no doubt that this was a wholly unexplained and frenzied attack.

'There was no suggestion of any ill feeling or problems between you and anyone in the Flowers family.'

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Flower said: 'I’m heartbroken and devastated at the way my husband’s life was taken.

'Len was a kind, generous and caring husband for 47 years - still fit and able. He helped anyone who asked for a favour.

'As a computer analyst he was an intelligent man, described as such by all who knew him and also very practical.

'I am lost without him as I am housebound and he was my full-time carer.

Mr Flower was only found when a couple who were delivering leaflets in the area spotted him in his garage, lying in a pool of blood. He was pronounced dead at the scene

'We did everything together. The fact that a good, decent man died in such a way hurts me too much.'

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Liz Mead, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'The Flower family find themselves in tragic circumstances.

'They now have to cope without Len who should be enjoying his retirement with his wife.

'Len was killed in his own garage, where he should have been safe, but on that October afternoon Sameer Babar carried out a violent attack which has now changed the course of so many innocent lives.

'The medical experts have agreed that at the time of Mr Flower’s death, Sameer Babar was suffering from a mental illness and continues to receive the appropriate medical attention for his condition.

'Today sees some closure for the Flower family but nothing that has happened in this court room will fill the void that Len’s death has left.'
