The 500th birthday party is days away. For the first time in centuries, entire cows will be roasted once again over the roaring fire in this mighty Tudor kitchen.

Plans are also under way to reopen Henry VIII’s famous wine fountain (with real wine).

Hampton Court has been enjoying record visitor numbers of late, buoyed by its starring role as a 2012 Olympic venue. And those crowds are only likely to increase with the Tudors resurgent on our TV screens.

Hampton Court Palace is just days away from celebrating its 500th birthday and enjoying record visitors

The BBC’s new codpiece-and-conspiracy drama Wolf Hall has already won rave reviews. Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII and Jonathan Pryce is Cardinal Wolsey, the scheming genius who started building work here at Hampton Court exactly five centuries ago in February 1515.

So, ahead of the great quincentennial birthday celebrations, I have come to look round one of the greatest royal palaces ever created. And yet I find two sides to this endlessly fascinating 1,324-room colossus beside the Thames.

Splendour: Robert Hardman samples the grandeur of historic Hampton Court Palace that is visited by 600,000 visitors each year

Because there is all the splendour of the tourist trail and state apartments, which draw 600,000 visitors each year. And then there are the dusty non-state apartments hidden from view and off-limits — for now at least.

These are the remnants of Hampton Court’s more recent role as the home of ‘grace and favour’ free accommodation courtesy of the Monarch and paid for by the Crown.

And while these rooms may not be as historically significant as, say, Henry VIII’s Great Hall, they tell an equally enthralling story.

With their Seventies bathroom suites, moth-eaten curtains and Heath Robinson communications, they were, until quite recently, a very grand home for an intriguing mix of national heroes, well-connected widows, impoverished toffs and the odd downright scrounger.

And the public footed the bill.

Pushing open one creaking door, I come across riotous floral wallpaper and a lot of Formica. This flat was once home to a famously degenerate countess and, more recently, the mother of a minister in John Major’s government.

Walking through another flat, recently vacated by the widow of a senior courtier, I find towels and sheets in the linen cupboard and a bedroom full of clutter. I also spot several copies of the Daily Mail from 1954 providing added insulation beneath the carpets.

So what is the story of this faded, private world hidden inside a hugely popular public attraction?

These apartments may not be remotely luxurious by modern standards but nor are they what most people would think of as ‘flats’. With an average of 12 rooms — plus servants’ quarters — they represent very substantial residences.

And there were more than 50 of them still going strong during the 20th century. They housed an illustrious cross-section of tenants — ranging from the fugitive sister of the last tsar (who lived in the grounds of the palace) to the indefatigable widow of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the scouting movement. Herself head of the Girl Guides, Lady Baden-Powell would often refer to Hampton Court as the ‘Hampers Hotel’.

The rooms may not be as historically significant, but Robert Hardman found they still told a story. PIctured: Hardman in a seventies style bathroom 

Most people associate Hampton Court with Tudor power. So many visitors are pleasantly surprised to find an entire baroque palace attached to the Tudor original by the Stuarts.

As my guide, Dr Lucy Worsley, the TV historian and chief curator of Historic Royal Palaces, explains, the Stuarts regarded Hampton Court as Britain’s answer to Versailles.

It wasn’t Henry VIII but Charles II who built the Venetian-style Long Water here. It was William and Mary who built the famous maze.

Gathering dust: Until quite recently the apartments were a 'grand home' for a mix of an illustrious people

The palace remained an important seat of royal power until the death of George II. But ever since then, our monarchs have chosen to hold court elsewhere.

With a large, empty palace at his disposal, George III decided to reward those who had performed a notable service to the Crown — or their widows — with rooms at Hampton Court ‘by grace and favour’.

Would-be residents had to apply to the Lord Chamberlain. An early applicant was Dr Samuel Johnson, author of the first English dictionary, who wrote a fawning letter to the Lord Chamberlain in 1776.

For all his brilliance, he was promptly rejected.

The great landscape architect, Capability Brown, on the other hand, was granted handsome lodgings. So, too, was Michael Faraday, the father of electrical engineering.

But despite their luck, some residents were always casting a jealous eye over their neighbours’ apartments. Charles Dickens described them as ‘civilised gypsies’ with ‘a dissatisfied air about themselves’. The Lord Chamberlain was bombarded with complaints. One Victorian spinster complained ‘common decency’ was ‘impossible’ because her two lavatories were less than 4ft feet from her drawing room. But when informed that they would have to pay for their keep, most grumblers desisted.

There was much Lady Grantham-style moaning, in 1838, when Queen Victoria announced that the state apartments would henceforth be open to the general public.

Similar outrage followed a ban on dogs, although the Lord Chamberlain grudgingly allowed ‘lap dogs’ (one of which turned out to be a Labrador).

Perhaps the most remarkable resident was Miss Millicent Gordon, daughter of a poor but well-connected Army officer.

She was born at Hampton Court and lived here for more than a century — through the Crimean, Zulu and Boer Wars and on through both world wars, too. In 1942, the 97-year-old spinster asked the authorities if she might finally be equipped with a bathroom. It was installed at last in 1949 — shortly after her death at the age of 104.

It was during World War II that George VI granted Rosalind Kennedy an apartment following the death of her husband, a gallant Royal Navy officer, on active service.

Her son, the broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy, came to live in his mother’s quarters for a short period, too. He later described the King’s gesture to Rosalind as ‘more tangible and lasting’ than a posthumous VC.

Though the system continued in to the current reign, its days were numbered. Few post-war residents were able to employ permanent staff and some were living at the top of several flights of stairs.

Many kept a basket on a pulley system and would hoist daily deliveries up the stairwell. In 1986, a tragic spotlight fell on this dwindling band of residents when fire broke out in a flat occupied by the elderly widow of WW1 and WW2 veteran General Sir Richard Gale. The blaze killed Lady Gale and did much damage to the palace.

Three years later, Hampton Court left state control to become part of Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity which also runs the Tower of London (without subsidy).

Today, the only surviving ‘grace and favour’ residents are two elderly widows of former royal officials and a handful resident staff — including the Keeper of the Great Vine (the gardener who tends the oldest grape vine in the world).

The Palace has a total of 1,324 rooms, but many of them are not open to the public. Pictured: Robert Hardman and Dr Worsley on the roof of the historic royal palace

As Dr Worsley takes me round, it’s clear that Hampton Court is still very much a work in progress.

For now, the priority is vital repairs to Anne Boleyn’s Gateway. Opening up the ‘grace and favour’ labyrinth can wait. Some former apartments have become offices and storage space.

Others have been handed to the Royal College of Needlework. One of the biggest, the Cumberland Suite, has just become a splendid new art gallery.

Many of the residents of Hampton Court Palace would keep a basket on a pulley system to hoist up their daily deliveries

But other flats have hardly changed since the last grace-and-favour residents moved out. We walk through Apartment 4, once home to the notoriously unfaithful Countess of Berkeley, of whom the 18th-century politician Horace Walpole wrote: ‘There is nothing so black of which she is not capable.’

The last resident was the Countess of Caithness, mother of Malcolm Caithness, who was a minister for John Major. She moved out in 1977, leaving behind a time capsule of the period — bright-pink flowery wallpaper, a rickety gas hob and an avocado bathroom suite.

Robert Hardman found that very little has changed since the majority of the grace and favour residents have moved out

The basket, with which she would hoist her morning milk and newspaper up 86 stairs, still dangles from her third floor landing.

A more recent departure was Lady Manning, the popular widow of a former governor of Jamaica, who lived here from 1935 to 1992. But although she had 40 rooms, her apartment had no heating. Walking through her flat today, it is absolutely perishing.

Hampton Court Palace is no part of the Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity which also runs the Tower of London 

Dr Worsley would like to open up this apartment to the public as a classic example of the grace and favour system but, for now, funds and staff are required elsewhere. ‘

‘And, of course, if we did open up all these old apartments, the public wouldn’t have enough time to see them all. There are just too many.’

Besides, she has another pet project: ‘If it’s the last thing I do, I am determined to get a Venetian gondola back on the Long Water!’

Life has certainly been strange but never dull round here.

Happy 500th, Hampton Court.
