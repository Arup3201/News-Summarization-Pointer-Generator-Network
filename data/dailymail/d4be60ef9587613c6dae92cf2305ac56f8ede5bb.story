Phil Robertson's anti-gay remarks have apparently driven away viewers as quickly as ducks fly away from shotguns as his reality show recorded its lowest viewership in the past 13 months.

The only other time that Duck Dynasty has only 6.65 million viewers for an original episode- like it had last week- was back in December of 2012 when the show's second season finale pulled in their lowest numbers to date.

Variety reports that in the week-to-week numbers released by Neilsen, the A&E reality show only hit a 3.3 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, and slid even lower to 2.9 in the targeted demo of more ideal viewers by advertising standards.

Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E

These
 figures serve as just the latest batch of bad news for the show, as it 
was reported earlier this week that the season 5 premiere marked a 28 
per cent drop in viewers as compared to that of season 4.

At that time, they were able to draw in 12 million viewers.

That
 was long before Robertson landed the family- and his show- in trouble 
following an interview with GQ magazine wherein he labeled homosexuality
 a sin and also offended African-Americans.

The remarks saw A&E initially suspend the star before an intense backlash by fans forced the network to reverse its decision and reinstate him.

The episodes, like almost all of the season, had already been shot when the contentious article hit newsstands.

Earlier this month, it emerged Robertson was plotting revenge on the TV network behind his hit show and reportedly has a plan in the works to move his family - plus millions of dollars of advertising and merchandise revenue - to another broadcaster.

Humiliated by A&E's attempt to silence his conservative religious message, Robertson - whose Duck Commander business is worth an estimated $15 million - is secretly plotting to form his own TV production company so he can jump ship to a Christian channel more in keeping with his views.

The Robertson clan are worth an estimated $15 million based of the back of the Duck Commander that Phil launched back in the 1970's

The Robertson clan have teamed up with Mossberg to create nine different shotguns, as well as two semiautomatic rifles and a semiautomatic pistol

Robertson, 67, recently served a 
short suspension from the hit show after his homophobic and racially 
insensitive comments but a massive outpouring of support from Conservative supporters including Sarah Palin convinced A&E to take Robertson back or risk
 losing their most important cash cow.

The
 public support for the comments have convinced the wily businessman 
that he and his family could be better served elsewhere on a network 
more understanding of his views â€“ such as overtly religious TV networks 
Trinity Broadcast Corporation and Christian Television Network.

He is also reported to be unhappy at how A&E has portrayed the extremely wealthy Robertson clan as ignorant hillbillies.

'A&E messed with the wrong redneck,' a source close to the show told the National Enquirer.

'Phil has agreed to return, but heâ€™s already working on getting out their contracts.'

Back in August the Robertson clan signed a new contract with A&E for $200,000 per episode. That contract is supposed to keep the family tied to the network for several more seasons, but Robertson is confident that he can get them out of it on a technicality after the forthcoming fifth season ends.

'He's confident lawyers can find a loophole and get them out of any long-term commitments,' said the source. 

'Phil
 wants to use his company name Duck Commander as the title for an 
entirely new show that they can produce themselves and be in control of 
what goes on.'

Robertson founded Duck Commander back in the 70's, selling duck calls that developed a loyal following among hunters.

Now that the family are stars in a top-rated cable-TV series, their business has expanded to sell a vast array of backwoods-themed merchandise via a number of national retailers.

Shoppers at Cabela's, Wal-Mart and 
Target can find Duck Commander branded items including DVDs, $15 action 
figures, $50 camouflage bedding sets, video games, throw rugs, a 
cookbook, coolers, T-shirts, caps, hoodies, underwear and, of course, 
the duck calls that started it all.

The businessman is set to capitalize even further on his huge 
popularity with conservatives with the launch of his own line of Duck 
Commander guns, reported CNN Money.

The Robertson clan have teamed up with Mossberg to create nine different shotguns, as well as two semiautomatic rifles and a semiautomatic pistol.

The shotguns come in a 'waterfowl pattern' camouflage design and Mossberg has already begun shipping them to distributors.

The family features prominently in a series of ads for the new guns on Mossberg's website. In one of the videos Phil says: 'Do you know what makes me happy ladies and gentlemen? To blow a mallard drake's head smooth off.'

Not all of the weapons are intended for duck hunting. The pistol and one of the rifles have military-style designs with large capacity magazines holding at least 25 rounds. The rifle has some of the features of an assault rifle, but with a relatively low .22 caliber.

On its website Mossberg says the .22-caliber pistol is 'perfect for small game, plinking, target shooting - or clearing cottonmouths out of your duck blind.'

All the firearms come with an American flag bandana 'like the one worn by Willie,' one of Robertson's sons.

In an earlier statement to FoxNews, the Robertson family said they were 'excited to keep making
 a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful 
support.

'We will 
continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through 
Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.'

A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.'

Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks.

'While Phil's comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the "coarse language" he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article.

'He also made it clear he would "never incite or encourage hate." We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' read the statement.

The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man's anus.

'That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.'

He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm saying?'

GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a 'stain' on the network.

GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe.
