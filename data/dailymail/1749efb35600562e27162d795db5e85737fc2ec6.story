Lazio teenager Keita Balde Diao has walked away unscathed after crashing his £158,000 yellow Lamborghini Gallardo. 

The 19-year-old, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool this month, wrote off his car over the weekend.

The front of Diao's car was left in pieces after the 19-year-old reportedly lost control of the vehicle 

Diao - playing for Lazio against Bologna in May - has been linked with a move to Premier League Liverpool 

Reports in Italy indicate that he lost control of the car and that he was below the legal limit. 

Diao has played three times for the Serie A outfit this season but is yet to find the net. 

Predominately an attacking player, he came through Barcelona's proficient youth system before joining Lazio three years ago. 

During his true breakthrough season at the Stadio Olimpico Diao turned out 33 times and was part of the side to make the knockout stages of the Europa League.
