Halloween's nine months away but this odd-shaped vegetable would be perfect for some ghoulish fun. 

Complete with a big toe and five smaller digits, the green Japanese radish looks strikingly similar to a human foot.

Instead of an ankle, it features a sprouting head of leaves. It measures 30cm long, making it a U.S. shoe size 12.

Yukihiro Ikeuchi discovered the 1.5kg bulbous root on his farm in Japan. 

He decided to save it from the shredder and offered it up for display instead.

It is currently on show in the southern town of Ayagawa. 

The radish is a staple ingredient in Japan used in both salads and main recipes.
