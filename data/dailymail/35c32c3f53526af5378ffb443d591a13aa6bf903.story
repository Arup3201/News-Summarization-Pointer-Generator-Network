Britain’s biggest solar farm – covering 224 acres – could be built in the Cornish countryside.

Renewable energy firm Good Energy wants to put 135,000 
solar panels on farmland near the village of Week St Mary.

It would 
cover an area six times bigger than the UK’s second largest solar power 
project.

The renewable electricity firm has 
not yet submitted a planning application for the project but has held 
discussions with Cornwall county council about its plans.

If approved, the solar farm could generate between 25 and 30 megawatts of electricity.

Dennis Coates, 81, who lives near the 
site, said: ‘People always say they want this energy, but to me it is 
taking a hell of a lot of farmland away.’

Britain’s second biggest project is  at Marley Thatch Farm, near South 
Brent in Devon, which was approved last month. It will cover 37 acres 
and have 28,000 photovoltaic panels.

Good Energy, which owns and operates Delabole - the UK’s first commercial wind farm - is currently in the 'early stages' of the planning process.

The firm has requested a 'scoping opinion' from Cornwall County Council, which will determine the extent of a required environmental impact assessment.

In documents submitted to the council, the firm confirmed: 'The total optioned landholding comprises 372 hectares (919 acres) of land made up of five separate farms.

'Of this land, 15 fields belonging to 
four landowners with a combined area of 91 hectares (224 acres) have 
been identified as suitable for solar photovoltaic development.'

But John Sandercock, 52, who lives close to the proposed site in the tiny Cornish town of St Mary, slammed the plans.

He said: 'It is about time all these things were not called farms, they should be called factories or power stations.

'I think it is a bit too much, it is all around the area the whole time now and it has turned into a joke.

'It is a large size and I think it is going to be about five square miles which is just not good for the area.'

There are already 12 solar farms and 
24 more have permission in Cornwall, with the largest having capacity of
around 5MW, enough to supply around 1,000 homes.

Adrian
Lea, manager of Cornwall Council’s natural resources planning team, has
said several firms had shown an interest in building solar farms of 20 
to 30MW capacity.
