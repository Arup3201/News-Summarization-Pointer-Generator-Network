A cash-strapped tradesman who was found guilty of murdering a Sydney woman at her waterfront mansion has been sentenced to a maximum of 24 years behind bars.

Shahnaz Qidwai's husband, daughters and son cried and embraced in court after the sentence was handed down while her killer Tony Halloun stood expressionless. 

The labourer, who was hired to concrete the Qidwais' driveway in 2012, had asked for $3,500 but Dr Khalid Qidwai refused to pay him before the job was done.

The next day, Shahnaz Qidwais was found bludgeoned to death in her multi-million-dollar home in Henley, in Sydney's north-west.

A NSW Supreme Court previously heard Halloun killed Mrs Qidwai, 65, and stole more than $3,000 from the family home.

It took just two hours for the jury in September to unanimously find the tradesman guilty of murder.

Her body was discovered by her youngest daughter Maha on her bedroom floor, her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises.

In sentencing Halloun on Friday, Justice Lucy McCallum said this 'grim experience has cast a haunting veil over her (Maha's) memories of her mother'.

It was clear Mrs Qidwai was an extraordinary woman, full of warmth and kindness and that her family 'will always ache' for her, she added.

Halloun, Justice McCallum said, had taken advantage of this kindness on the day of Mrs Qidwai's death by getting her to allow him into the home. 

Once inside, the financially-stressed Halloun rummaged through the envelopes of cash kept by Mrs Qidwai.

While no one could say for certain what happened next, Justice McCallum said she was satisfied Mrs Qidwai probably happened upon Halloun doing something wrong and he attacked her 'out of panic'.

'I am satisfied that the offender formed an intention to steal from the house but I doubt he intended to kill Mrs Qidwai,' she said.

Halloun has shown no remorse and told many lies, including one 'bizarre tale' that he had seen masked intruders holding Mrs Qidwai at gunpoint on the day of her death.

'His apparent inability to accept responsibility for (the murder) in the face of an overwhelming circumstantial case may come down to a question of pride or an inability to say out loud that he did such a terrible thing.'

But, she said, up until the murder, Halloun had led a good life and that the offence was out of character.

She sentenced the 35-year-old to a maximum of 24 years and a minimum of 17.

Taking into account time already served, he will be eligible for parole in August 2029.

Two years ago, the concreter went to the doctor's surgery on June 14 and asked for $3,500 but Dr Qidwai refused to pay before the job was done.

Halloun became aggressive, the court heard, and used the chilling words: 'I'll win in the end'.

The next day, Mrs Qidwai wasfound bludgeoned to death in her multi-million-dollar Henley home - in Sydney's north-west - following the bitter feud.

It took a NSW Supreme Court jury just two hours in September to find Tony Halloun guilty of the murder of Shahnaz Qidwai in her Henley home on June 15, 2012.

The victim's widower Dr Khalid Qidwai and their adult children wept as the jury handed down its decision while the detective who led the investigation wiped away tears. 

Halloun showed no emotion as he removed his tie and was led from the dock.

One of his supporters sat with mouth agape and head bowed.

Halloun's trial heard he was nearly $100,000 in debt at the time of the killing and had repeatedly asked Dr Qidwai for cash.
