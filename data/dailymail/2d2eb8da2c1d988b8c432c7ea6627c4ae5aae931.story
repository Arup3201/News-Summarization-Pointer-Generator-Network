A Swedish slopestyle skier advanced to the men's finals on Thursday in Sochi despite losing his skis - and his trousers - at one point.

Henrik Harlaut, who has not cut his hair in the past four years, posted an impressive 83.20 on his second trip, which was good enough to make the medal round, although he finished in sixth place behind an American trio led by Joss Christensen

He flashed a 'hang loose' sign after advancing and had no plans to cinch up his trousers for the finals.

Wipeout: Harlaut suffered the embarrassment of losing both his skis... and his trousers, which were hanging dangerously below the waist in the first place

Ski spirit: Harlaut said he was has skied like that for 10 years and has no plans to change any time soon

He lost his skis during his first qualifying run, forcing  him to do the walk of shame back up the hill to fetch them, his blue tights evident as his suspenders fought a mostly losing battle to keep the pants somewhere in the vicinity of his waist.

'I don't find it difficult,' he said. 'I've skied like that the past 10 years. It's been (my style) for awhile. I'm pretty comfortable like that.'

Per Kristian Hunder, a Norwegian skier, said: 'He's always been the most baggy.

'It's just his style. And people love it. We have a pretty wide stance. I guess we could all ski with our pants down to our knees.'

Harlaut was a lot happier with his second run in the skiing final, where he finished sixth
