MP Simon Burns, the former HS2 Minister, spoke out after Mr Bercow filed a 13-page protest over new laws that pave the way for the rail link

A former Tory Rail Minister last night called Commons Speaker John Bercow a ‘cry baby’ for objecting to the HS2 high-speed rail line – because building works will cause traffic jams near his home.

MP Simon Burns said ‘biased’ Mr Bercow, whose Buckingham constituency is on the route of the £50 billion rail link, should be banned from chairing Commons debates on the issue.

In an unprecedented verbal assault on the Speaker – traditionally a non-party political role – Mr Burns said that Mr Bercow should resign if he was ‘so concerned’ about the matter, enabling him to vote against it as a backbench MP.

Mr Burns, who was until last October the Government’s HS2 Minister, spoke out after the Speaker, who entered Parliament as a Tory, filed a 13-page protest over new laws that pave the way for the rail line from London to Birmingham.

Mr Bercow demanded to be called as a witness before a Commons committee to object to plans for the line, which he has previously condemned as ‘a wasteful white elephant’.

He also called for cash compensation for residents affected by the route – and protection for a rare species of bats.

And he said traffic jams caused by building works would inconvenience him by causing ‘delays in journey times travelling to and from my home’.

His demands provoked an extraordinary counter-attack by Mr Burns, who has been in a long-running feud with Mr Bercow after he was overheard calling him a ‘stupid, sanctimonious dwarf’.

Mr Burns, MP for Chelmsford, said last night: ‘John Bercow should join the real world. Everyone has to put up with traffic delays when there’s major improvements to infrastructure.

'To cry like a baby about that and use it to try to stop a project that is going to bring so many jobs and connect the great cities of this country really is special pleading.

‘If he’s so worried about being able to drive round his constituency, he could resign and vote against it from the backbenches.’

He also accused the Speaker of favouring HS2 opponent and fellow Buckinghamshire MP Cheryl Gillan in Commons debates.

‘Every time Cheryl gets up to speak on HS2, he calls her to speak first and he sits there grinning like a Cheshire Cat, nodding in approval,’ he said.

He added that Mr Bercow had a right as a constituency MP to speak up for residents – but should be removed from the Speaker’s Chair for debates on HS2.

He asked why Mr Bercow was allowed to preside over an HS2 debate in April when opponents, led by Mrs Gillan, tried to block the legislation.

‘Bercow should have excused himself from the start because he has a vested interest,’ he said. ‘It should be left to one of the Speaker’s deputies. I have no idea who is advising him on this, but it doesn’t matter because, if he disagrees, he will throw a tantrum.

Mr Bercow, whose Buckinghamshire constituency is on the London to Birmingham route, demanded to be called as a witness before a Commons committee to object to the 'wasteful white elephant'

'He should not be given special privileges simply because he’s Speaker.’

Mr Burns’s attack marks a new low in relations between the Tories and the Speaker.

A
 former Right-wing Conservative, Mr Bercow forged strong links with 
Labour MPs, whose support was vital in his success in being elected as 
Speaker.

Tory MPs claim he is ‘biased’ towards Labour and singles out Tory MPs, such as Mr Burns, for rebukes for heckling.

A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow last night denied any bias, adding that he had been ‘scrupulously impartial’ in the HS2 debate.

She
 said: ‘In his capacity as a local MP, he petitioned on behalf of his 
constituents, just as a Government Minister would do, and joined 
thousands of other people who petitioned against the Bill.’
