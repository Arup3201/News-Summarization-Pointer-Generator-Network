West Ham are sending scouts to watch Austria vs Russia on Saturday with Aleksandar Dragovic and Martin Hinteregger on their radar.

Manager Sam Allardyce is weighing up defensive reinforcements, particularly with the future of Winston Reid unresolved.

Reid, who is out of contract in the summer, has yet to agree to new terms at Upton Park and is the subject of interest from several Premier League clubs.

However, West Ham are reluctant to sell even in January so as not to disrupt their promising season.

Defenders Dragovic and Hinteregger have earned rave reviews at their respective clubs Dynamo Kiev and Red Bull Salzburg.

Dragovic caught the eye while at FC Basle and would cost around £6million. Arsenal and Chelsea have also monitored his progress.

Hinteregger was watched by Manchester United last year as well as Liverpool and Arsenal.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is keen to bolster his defence with Winston Reid's future still in doubt

Reid's contract expires at the end of the season and it is unclear if he will sign an extension
