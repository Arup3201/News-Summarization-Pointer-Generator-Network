Flirting, punting and leapfrogging in the meadows, these carefree students enjoy their last days in the summer sun as the shadows of World War II loom larger.

This poignant video - never before seen 
in public - shows a bygone age of blissful university life at Cambridge 
more than 70 years ago.

Shot by a student, the nostalgic scenes include men and women, in the prime of their lives, at play.

Punting in the Cam, students did their best to remain carefree and relaxed before many gave their lives for the war effort

But the signs of war are all around with sandbags everywhere, evacuation drills and RAF planes in the skies above. Months after the film was shot by St John's College student Malcolm Shaw, many of the students enlisted - and never lived to see their beloved Cambridge again.

The grainy images show sunny trips to Grantchester and Babraham, sporting events such as the 1941 Cuppers Final, and tennis tournaments at Girton.

Other snapshots show the RAF training
 to fight the Germans as well as the college lawns being dug up to plant
 vegetables as part of the 'Dig for Victory' campaign.

Two
 of Shaw's sequences, set to the poignant music Moon River, show 
thrill-seeking students, including Shaw himself, climbing iconic 
Cambridge buildings in broad daylight.

Shaw,
 who died in 2003 after a career in the chemicals industry, edited the 
snapshots into a 20-minute film in 1989, and added a voiceover.

His closing remarks reveal his nostalgic fondness for his student years.

In 1942, all men between 18 and 51 and all women between 20 and 30 would be called up for service

He says: 'What happy days those were, and relatively carefree despite the background of a country at war.'

Tracy Wilkinson, archivist at St John's College Cambridge, said: 'At one level, the film is an example of how, even though there was a lot of hardship because of the war, many people still tried to make the best of things and live as normal a life as they could.

‘What we see in Shaw's film is the 
lighter side of College life. Despite his time at St John's coinciding 
with the outbreak of war, the sense of there still being time for 
leisure is evident.’

'At the same time it is also quite 
poignant, because it was made in 1941, a year before all male British 
subjects between 18 and 51, and women between 20 and 30, became eligible
 for call-up into the armed forces.

Flirting, laughing, and having fun on the home front, as the shadows of war loom large

Relaxing in the Cambridge daisies, but Wolrd War II would see many students never return to Cambridge to resume their studies

'Although nobody knew it at the time,
 Shaw was capturing what was the last months of leisure before many of 
these people themselves went to war.

'With hindsight, that makes the film very moving because we can see the signs of war in the background.'

The film was given to the college following Mr Shaw's death, where it will be preserved for future generations.

It has now been made available online as part of a wider digitisation project in the archives following a grant from the East of England Research Council.

Carefree days at Cambridge University, students were in their last summer days before many of them would be called up for war service

Although the war started in 1939, students were not called up until 1942

Blissful days on the Cam, but thoughts of war could never be that far away

Educated at a grammar school in West 
Yorkshire, Malcolm Shaw went up to St John’s to read Natural Sciences as
 an undergraduate in 1939, just as war was breaking out in Europe.

Part
 of the film’s timeless appeal lies in its ordinariness, showing 
students getting on with academic and social life and having fun despite
 the planes and signs of wartime.

Despite
 the archaic fashions and rigid formality of the 1940s, with students 
wearing suits for punting on the river and being addressed by initials 
and surnames, the film reveals how little life has changed for many 
Cambridge students today.

Shaw’s sequences show students including Shaw himself climbing iconic Cambridge buildings: not under cover of darkness as the infamous ‘Night Climbers of Cambridge’ did a decade earlier, but in broad daylight.

Time to relax after a hard day's studying, these pictures were captured on video camera in 1941

Smartly dressed Cambridge students put thoughts of war behind them, but some would not return

Such activities were permitted during wartime as part of fire drills and evacuation training.

In his book A Century at King's, 
author L.P. Wilkinson described the uncertainty of the early weeks of 
World War II at nearby college King's, saying it was a period of 
confusion and ambiguity.

'When war actually broke out, there was an element of relief mingled with horror and apprehension,' he wrote.

Tea anyone? Dressed in a dapper suit and tie, a blissful image of life at Cambridge

At
 first life continued as normal, with students encouraged to come up to 
King's. They pursued their studies until they were called up for duty, 
but behind the routine lurked the spectre of what was to come.

By
 1942-43 the university had developed a scheme which allowed men to come
 up to Cambridge as cadets and study for two terms whilst doing their 
military training.

The 
traditional Christmas season concerts were maintained, though the 1940 
Christmas Eve broadcast service was accompanied by the drone of 
aeroplanes during the Battle for Britain.
