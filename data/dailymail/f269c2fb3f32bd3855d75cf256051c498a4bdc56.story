A canny police sniffer dog refused to be thrown off the scent by two crooks after they smashed a bottle of aftershave to distract him following the fastest car chase ever seen in Britain.

Brave Axel and his handler PC Gez Cotter tracked down criminals Ben Westwood, 33, and Gregory Simpson, 26, who had led police on a dangerous 180mph 65-mile pursuit on the M6 near Wolverhampton.

The thieves had carried out 15 smash-and-grab raids across the Midlands in their one of a kind Audi with a Lamborghini engine and race car brakes, stealing £50,000 of cigarettes, cash and jewellery.

Super sniffer: Axel refused to give up the chase to find Ben Westwood and Gregory Simpson who smashed a bottle of aftershave in a failed attempt to hide from the star dog

Axel and PC Cotter were called on to find Westwood and Simpson after they dumped the £85,000 car outside a block of flats in the town of Wednesfield.

As the crime fighting pair entered the foyer PC Cotter, 43, quickly noticed the stench of a bottle of aftershave Westwood and Simpson had smashed at the bottom of the stairs to cover their scent.

But for super-nosed Axel it was no problem as he quickly led his handler up two flights of stairs and into the flat where the two crooks were found cowering under a bed.

Good friends: PC Cotter has spoken with pride about Axel and his determination to catch criminals whatever the circumstances

The pair was caught on January 13 after police officers spotted him 
and his gang attempting to break open a cash machine at a Murco petrol 
station in Penn, West Midlands.

Three of the gang were arrested at the scene but Westwood and Simpson managed to flee in the car.

When officers seized the car, which had been resprayed black and 
disguised with a false plate, they discovered it had clocked up 1,500 
miles since it was stolen.

Dynamic duo: PC Cotter and Axel arrived at the flats to the stench of aftershave on the stairs, but the dog raced up and found the crooks cowering under a bed

Thanks to Axel and PC Cotter both Westwood and Simpson were arrested 
and later jailed for a combined total of 13 years for a spate of 
robberies across the UK.

Team: Axel and PC Cotter were called to find Westwood and Simpson after they dumped a £85,000 super-car outside a block of flats

PC Cotter says Axel’s nose is now well-known across Britain for being pretty unique among police dogs.He has worked with the dog for two years, and said Axel was so good he was called upon nationally to track down high-risk missing persons.

'When we got into the public foyer of the flats I saw a bottle of aftershave smashed at the bottom of the stairs, they clearly thought they could hide their scent or even attempt to injure Axel,' he said.

'But he wasn’t fazed at all and lead me straight up two flights of stairs right to the door of the flat they were in before finding them hiding under a bed.

'Criminals will sometimes try all sorts of tricks but a bottle of Old Spice wasn’t going to stop Axel getting his man.'

PC Cotter said Axel’s skill with his nose had already earned him a commendation from a coroner.

He said: 'In December last year we were called to Cumbria to search for a missing person thought to be in a canal lock.

'Divers had not been able to locate anything but despite 20 feet of water and frozen ground Axel indicated where it was straight away, his nose is pretty unique.'
