A worried father who clocked nearly 80mph in a 30mph zone to save his daughter's life has been spared a lengthy driving ban.

Ricky Bunting, 23, frantically drove home after his girlfriend called to tell him his two-month-old daughter Ava had turned blue and stopped breathing.

He arrived back at the house to find Ava 'lifeless' and rushed her to the the hospital in his van, Rotherham Magistrates Court heard.

She was diagnosed with severe bronchitis and made a full recovery after treatment, although she has been in and out of hospital since with breathing problems.

Ricky, from Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty  to the speeding offence in May last year.

The tyre fitter admitted to driving his company's Skoda Fabia van at 79mph on High Street, near Bellows Road, Rawmarsh at 7.52 am.

The speed camera snapped him on his journey back to the house he shares with girlfriend Kealey Tinker, and again en route to the hospital.

Magistrates were told the speed would usually warrant an automatic and lengthy disqualification - because it was well over sentencing guidelines for speeding offences.

Phil Jones, mitigating, said Ava's condition was not a medical emergency as defined in law and therefore not a special reason for discretion over a banning order.

Mr Jones asked magistrates to ban him immediately for two weeks to coincide with Mr Bunting's holiday from work, which would mean he kept his job.

But he added: 'It explains why he was driving so quick, but doesn't excuse it. 

'Yes, he was driving extremely quickly, yes it is unacceptable and should be punished and if you were to impose such a disqualification he could remain in employment.'

Magistrates told Bunting it was a 'very dangerous' speed. He was fined £400 with £85 costs and was banned from driving for two weeks.

Afterwards he said Kealey and Ava, now 10-months-old, had been in and out of hospital with breathing problems.

He added: 'Everyone's doing fine now and it's a relief not to be banned for longer and risk losing my job.'
