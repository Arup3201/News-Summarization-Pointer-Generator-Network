It’s business as usual in the world of Massimo Cellino. As we embark on another month, Leeds United will have themselves a new manager.

Neil Redfearn has all but agreed to become the next in an ever-expanding line of head coaches at Elland Road. Odds are he won’t last.

Not because the 49-year-old doesn’t have the skillset to reinvigorate Leeds, far from it. The length of his tenure will be decided by an Italian hell-bent on transforming the fortunes of this massive club at breakneck speed and with regard to who he tramples in the process.

Redfearn will want assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino appointed Darko Milanic last month, but sacked him after just 32 days

Fans in Yorkshire aren’t surprised, and they’re quite right not to be.

Cellino is an individual who rules with little reason. When the switch flicks, there is no stopping him. Unfortunately for Leeds they are the latest club to have flickered and sputtered under his ownership.

To summarise what’s happened since he took over – and not touching on the canteen staff at Thorp Arch getting the boot – Dave Hockaday was afforded 70 days in charge before Darko Milanic lasted just six games.

The only period of solidity this season has come under Redfearn on the back of Hockaday’s sacking when the caretaker took 10 points from a possible 12. He wanted the top job but was overlooked.

Milanic may or may not have worked out – we will now never know. There were suggestions from fans that he set out not to lose games rather than attempting to win them and it could’ve been that he was a doomed appointment from the get-go.

Cellino’s failing here was not to perform due diligence.

‘I made a mistake with this guy. He’s negative, he has a losing mentality,’ he told the Yorkshire Evening Post after sacking the Slovenian.

Slovenian Milanic was appointed on a two-year deal but did not even last two months at Elland

Cellino has the Yorkshire club's best interests at heart but makes knee-jerk decisions all too often

It beggars belief that an owner of a football club – charged with making decisive action after getting it so wrong with Hockaday – was not already aware of the sort of football Milanic would be bringing with him.

Cellino has his club’s best interests at heart - that hasn’t been questioned by supporters - in a similar vein to the much-maligned Venky’s at Blackburn Rovers. That much is clear; so too is the illogical decision-making.

The 58-year-old’s chief difficultly is an inability to think before reaching the sort of verdicts which could plunge Leeds into really serious trouble. What if Redfearn - a man Cellino clearly didn't fancy to begin with - doesn't carry on where he left off? There could be another p45 on its way.  

Leeds' loss to Wolves at the weekend was the final straw for Cellino, who sacked Milanic afterwards

Former Cagliari boss Nedo Sonetti is alleged to have been sacked by Cellino for eating a four-kilo sea bass

Sonetti is said to have been spotted by Cellino eating the fish in a clubhouse at Cagliari's training base 

After all, this is the same man who is alleged to have sacked a boss at Cagliari for eating sea bass.

In a quote dug up by Rory Smith in the Times on Tuesday, Nedo Sonetti said years after his dismissal in 2002: ‘He always says he has just cause [for sacking a manager]. In my case he said that he had seen me in a clubhouse at the training ground eating a four-kilo sea bass. That was his cause.

There is simply no talking to a man who relieves someone of their livelihood on the back of eating an obscene amount of fish. Leeds must hope that his impulses are lucky guesses from now on.
