Hate preacher Abu Qatada arrived at his new home reportedly near Wembley Stadium in London and telephoned his parents in Jordan at 6am yesterday to boast of his ‘elation’ at being out of jail.

The ‘truly dangerous’ fanatic had 
been released from Long Lartin high security prison yesterday under 
cover of darkness to live near the terror target.

Qatada expressed his joy on another day 
of high-stakes wrangling and political rows over the best way of 
deporting the Al Qaeda-linked preacher back to Jordan.

Qatada expressed his joy on another day 
of high-stakes wrangling and political rows over the best way of 
deporting the Al Qaeda-linked preacher back to Jordan.

Last night officials were hopeful they were moving closer to a deal that may prove acceptable to the European Court of Human Rights, which is stubbornly blocking his removal.

Qatada - whose new home is reportedly near Wembley Stadium, a prime terror target - called his family home in a poor area of Amman to tell relatives of his delight at being with his wife and five children again.

He has spent the past decade in and out of British jails.

His mother, Aisha Othman, said: ‘He telephoned to say how happy he was to be out of prison.

‘He was elated to be with his wife and his children again. He was just so pleased. It was wonderful.’

Mrs Othman, who told the Mail that Qatada should be sent back to Jordan, beamed as she said: ‘Thank you, thank you to Britain for at least setting my son free. I want him to be allowed home, of course, but this is very good news.’

Under the terms of his bail, Qatada must observe a 22-hour curfew, and is banned from talking to a list of 27 named fanatics.

He is also barred from having a mobile phone, internet access or using any landline phone which is not inside his home address.

While Qatada enjoyed his first full day of freedom at his London home, a Home Office delegation led by security minister James Brokenshire was in Jordan trying to negotiate the fanatic’s deportation. 

ECHR judges in Strasbourg ruled he could not be sent for trial in Jordan if there was a risk that some of the evidence against him might have been obtained by torture.

In a potential breakthrough, Jordan’s legislative affairs minister, Ayman Odeh, promised that Qatada will receive a fair trial with full rights.

He said that while Jordan considered Strasbourg’s attack on its legal system to be unfair, an amendment had now been passed to outlaw the use of evidence obtained through torture, or the threat of it, in trials.

Even if this is acceptable to Strasbourg, Qatada could immediately lodge his own appeal against removal, delaying it by yet more months while the public continues to foot his £10,000-a-week security bill.

Pressure has been building on ministers simply to put Qatada on a plane in defiance of Strasbourg.

Other countries which have ignored the court, such as Italy and France, have received only a fine or letter of warning. Tory former minister David Mellor said: ‘The ruling in Strasbourg is a gnat-bite that the British Government is totally free in law to ignore.’

Last night friends of Qatada speculated that Britain could try to return him to Jordan within the next week.

In Amman, Marwan Shehada, a friend of the preacher’s family, said Qatada had asked the British government to request a guarantee from

the King of Jordan that he would be given a fair trial. Mr Shehada said he thought Qatada would be happy to return to Jordan if the right guarantees could be secured.

● Qatada is a Manchester United supporter, his family have revealed.

As a youngster he was a keen footballer who played for his school.

It is not known if Qatada has visited Old Trafford during his 19 years in Britain.

Fellow fanatic Osama Bin Laden watched his favourite team, Arsenal, while living in London in the 1990s.
