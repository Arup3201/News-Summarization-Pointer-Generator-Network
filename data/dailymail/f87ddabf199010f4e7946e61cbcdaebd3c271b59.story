As Steve King led his team of firefighters into the smoke-filled darkness, he knew he had a tough situation to deal with.

But it wasn't just the flames and choking fumes from the fire that were posing a risk.

The dangerous inhabitants of the Reptile Reserve pet shop, in Rainham, East London, were on the loose.

Through the smoke lurked a menagerie 
of dangerous creatures, including a Burmese python, ten Nile crocodiles 
and Europe's largest anaconda.

Many of the animals had escaped their cages and were roaming free as the inferno tore through the shop.

The team had to 'crawl' through a dense undergrowth of potted plants shrouded in smoke to reach the stricken animals, not knowing what would be lurking around the corner.

'The property had a complicated layout with branches and leaves hanging down,' said Steve, Blue Watch manager from Wennington Fire Station.

'The jungle effect and the thick smoke meant our crews had to work hard in extremely difficult conditions to rescue the animals and keep the property safe.

'Firefighters were crawling around in the dark smoke, knowing there were potentially dangerous animals about - it was one of the strangest jobs we have ever attended.'

It was made all the more stranger when the firefighters had to give oxygen to an iguana suffering from smoke inhalation.

Around 20 firefighters from three separate fire stations risked life and limb as they saved the ferocious creatures from the from the burning store.

The
shop was decked out with jungle plants and rescuers today spoke of 
their fear as they crawled though the thick vegetation shrouded in 
smoke.

Firefighters 
retrieved the whopping 23ft long Anaconda, iguanas, monitor lizards and 
four pythons between 6ft and 10ft long - and gave them oxygen to help 
their breathing.

The blaze was brought under control and the cause of the fire is currently under investigation.

It is believed to have been contained on the bottom floor of the shop which measures 15m by 12m.

No animals escaped, but five lizards sadly perished in the blaze.

The surviving animals have been relocated to the owner’s other shop in the same road called Cold Blooded Reptile Centre.

Terry Fisk was driving past the shop at around 10pm when he saw the blaze.

He said: 'It was very chaotic and it was bit of a shock.

'I really feel for the animals and I am really surprised that more of them did not die because there was so much smoke.'

Steve added: 'We had visited the premises only a few months ago so that in the event of a fire, they would know what to do.

'This was an extremely unusual incident and I’d like to commend the excellent work of the crews involved.'

Nile crocodiles, which are native to Africa, can grow up to a staggering 16ft long while the giant tortoise can grow up to 4ft long and weight a massive 300 kg in its native tropical islands habitats.

Shop owner, James Hilbrown, 38, added: 'When I first got to the shop and saw all the smoke pouring out I really feared the worst, but lucklily the fire was confined to just one area of the shop.

'I've spent ten years working on that shop, and some of the animals in there I rescued a decade ago, so I was terrified I could lose them.

'There was smoke everywhere but we managed to get nearly all of the animals affected out.

'When we got outside we noticed some of the animals weren't looking too well - the iguanas had gone all floppy.

'One of the firemen suggested giving them some oxygen - and it worked.'
