Britain’s big six energy companies have enjoyed a £3.3billion windfall in profits since the election - while consumers’ bills have soared by £300 a year.

Labour said the figures show that David Cameron has not done enough to crack down on profiteering by gas and electric firms.

Since 2009, Britain’s Big Six energy companies (British Gas, E.ON, EDF, npower, Scottish Power and SSE) have been required to report to regulator Ofgem on their annual profits for generating and selling power.

Between them, they supply 98 per cent of households in Britain.

Labour’s new research shows that the total profits (earnings before interest and taxation) of the Big Six energy companies increased from £2.158billion in 2009 to £2.219billion in 2010, £3.867billion in 2011, and £3.737billion in 2012.

This represents a total windfall in profits of over £3.3billion since 2010.

According to Ofgem’s latest Electricity and Gas Supply Market Indicators, the typical domestic dual fuel bill now stands at £1,420 a year, compared to £1,105 in May 2010 when David Cameron became Prime Minister.

Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘With warnings of more price rises this winter, it’s clearer than ever that Britain needs to break the dominance of the energy giants and protect the public from being ripped off.’

The party plans to abolish Ofgem and create a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall.

The party would also require the energy companies to pool the power they generate and to make it available to any retailer, to open up the market and make it more transparent. The firms would also be banned from offering unfair contracts and rolling small businesses over on to more expensive tariffs without their consent.

Small businesses would only be able to be back-billed for one year, and not subjected to six years of crippling back-billing, which at the moment can run into tens of thousands of pounds.

And energy suppliers would have to take into account small businesses’ ability to pay any debt, and come up with a realistic and reasonable repayment plan, and not demand full payment immediately.

Miss Flint said: ‘The public have been left with a £3.3billion price tag for David Cameron’s failure to act on rip-off energy bills.

‘He’s totally out of touch with millions of people and small businesses who are struggling with soaring energy bills. His failure to reform Britain’s broken energy market is leaving hard-pressed bill-payers massively out of pocket.’

Earlier this week, Labour published research revealing the full scale of the cost of living crisis facing Britain’s families under David Cameron.

It found that working people are today an average of £1,350 worse off a year since the Coalition took over - and official forecasts show that over the course of this Parliament, that figure will reach £6,660.

Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ‘This is a disappointing and inaccurate bashing of an industry which brings heat and light to 27million homes and business, pays billions each year to the Exchequer and creates employment for over 600,000 people.

‘If a company is to stay in business it has to make a profit. And the more a company has to invest then it has to make more profit to do so.

‘What is actually needed is a clear, sensible and coherent debate on what people want, how much wind power and how much gas, nuclear and coal is needed, what capacity is required and, critically, how much people are prepared to pay for it all. Petty point scoring has no place in the adult discussion and decision making required.’
