Arsenal fans have accused Ashley Cole of being obsessed by money ever since he left them for Chelsea - and on this occasion, they could have a point.

Cole met his former Chelsea and England team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips met for lunch in a Hollywood hotel and the defender paid for the meal from an envelope stuffed with cash.

The 33-year-old is a free agent after seeing out his contract at Stamford Bridge and was dropped from England's World Cup squad, prompting his international retirement.

Arsenal supporters have labelled Cole 'Cashley' ever since he moved across London in 2006 and was paid £90,000 a week by Chelsea.

When he played for his new club against Arsenal for the first time, some Gooners held up fake £20 notes with his face on.

Even before his transfer supporters were
 angry with him due to a clandestine meeting with Chelsea boss Jose 
Mourinho. Cole eventually moved to Stamford Bridge as part of a £5million deal 
which led to William Gallas going the other way.

Revelations (in his own autobiography) of Cole's wage demands also did not help his perception among ordinary football fans.

The passage in his book about his agent's contract negotiations with Arsenal chairman David Dein, was savaged by supporters and the media.

Cole was not happy to be offered £55,000 a week instead of £60,000 and wrote: 'When I heard Jonathan (Barnett, his agent) repeat the figure of £55k (a week), I nearly swerved off the road. “He is taking the p***, Jonathan!” I yelled down the phone.

'I was so 
incensed. I was trembling with anger. I couldn’t believe what I’d heard.
 I suppose it all started to fall apart for me from then on.'

Chelsea (2006-2014) Games 339 Goals 7

England (2001-2014) Caps 107 Goals 0

And he 
received wider public notoriety when stories emerged that he cheated on his 
former wife Cheryl, at the time a much-loved high-profile presenter on 
The X Factor.

This
 animosity led to him being booed by England fans during a match at 
Wembley against Kazakhstan, as well as being a poster boy for everything
 that was wrong with the game (although it should be pointed out, for balance, that he was named England fans' player of the year for 2010).

He was seen as mocking the FA's Respect campaign in 2008 when he deliberately turned his back on Mike Riley in an act of dissent as the referee was trying to caution him.

The perception of him as the crass modern footballer was not helped when, in 2011, he accidentally shot and wounded a 21-year-old student on work experience at Chelsea's Cobham training ground.

He
 did not endear himself to the football authorities in 2012, either, 
when he sent out a hastily deleted tweet labelling the FA a 'bunch of 
t****'.

However, his value on the pitch has rarely been in question and the 107-cap former England star will have a list of suitors as he searches for a new club.

Liverpool, Manchester City,
 Manchester United and Real Madrid all linked with the left back, while a shock moved back to Arsenal is also on the cards. Monaco and New York Red Bulls may also be interested.

His lunch partner in LA, Wright-Phillips, might find it a bit more difficult to find a new club.

He made just 13 appearances for Queens Park Rangers last season and failed to score. The 32-year old is said to be ready to quit Loftus Road., whether he is offered a new contract or not.
