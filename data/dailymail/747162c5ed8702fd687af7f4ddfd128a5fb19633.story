A Chinese public official has been sacked after he was pictured ordering an employee to carrying through a flood to avoid getting his shoes wet.

Wang Junhua was visiting an area where two young people had died as a result of recent flooding, when he ordered his subordinate carry him after realising the sodden ground would ruin his cream leather shoes.

Mr Wang, the deputy director of the government office of Guixi city, Jiangxi province, has now been removed from his position, authorities confirmed.

Bad boss: Wang Junhua, deputy director of the government office of Guixi city, Jiangxi province, forced his subordinate to carry him through a flood so he would not ruin his shoes

According
 to local media Mr Wang was visiting the site where two students 
drowned, and had not bothered to wear appropriate footwear.

Instead
 he had selected cream coloured leather shoes, and instead of getting 
them wet, he had employee Ding Xianbao give him a piggyback.

Hu
 Peng, a local who witnessed the incident, said: ‘The guy looked 
arrogant and bored. 

'It was clear that he came to the site in order to 
score some cheap publicity points.  But when he saw that he might have 
to get his feet wet his real personality surfaced

‘He
 ordered this guy to hoist him on his shoulders and he rode him like he 
was a donkey.  I felt sorry for the guy - he was humiliated.’

'Publicity points': Mr Wang was visiting the affected area after two students died in the floods

Communist
 Party officials removed him from his post when they learned about the 
piggy back and denied that the man had ordered the subordinate to carry 
him, saying that Ding had volunteered.

But
 they admitted it was still wrong, with one saying: ‘It was not within 
his remit to order another human being to become his drudge.

‘This
 is not how things work in China.  If he didn't want to get wet feet, he
 should have brought along rubber waders, not turn a worker into his 
personal transportation.’

The man is appealing his job loss but party officials say their decision is ‘final'.

Rainstorms
 and floods sweeping eastern and southern China since mid-June have left
 14 people dead, four missing and up to 3 million people affected.

China's central Hunan Province was one of the worst hit, where seven people have died.

Also badly affected was Jiangxi province in the east where another five
 people lost their lives and in Guangxi Zhuang, an autonomous region in 
the south of the country, where another two people perished.
