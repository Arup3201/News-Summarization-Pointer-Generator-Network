Four children have been taken into care after police rescued them from their fighting parents at a squalid address in Queens, New York, crammed with animals.

Emergency services were responding to a report of a dog bite, but when they arrived they allegedly found Jasean Holmes, 29, clashing with his wife.

Inside the apartment, on Richmond Hill, they also discovered four children aged between seven and 11, five adult pit bull terriers, 10 puppies, two boa constrictors and a lizard.

Police arrested Jasean Holmes, and took four children, 15 dogs including 10 pit bull puppies similar to these, two snakes and a lizard into care

The property was littered with rubbish and dogs' faeces, according to the New York Post.

The EMS crew witnessed the couple fighting and when police arrived they arrested Holmes and took his wife, who was not named, in for questioning.

Speaking to the NY Post, neighbours said the couple were constantly fighting and police had been called to the address dozens of times.

Two boa constrictors, similar to this one, were among the many animals that have been taken into care after police arrested Holmes

However, officers had never made any arrests because the wife had never pressed charges.

According to the NY Post, on this occasion EMS crew saw Holmes allegedly beating his wife and kicking one of the dogs.

He was charged with acting in a manner injurious to a child, aggravated cruelty to animals, torturing or injuring animals, and assault against his wife.

The news service said it was unclear if the wife faced any charges.

In interview with the Post, one neighbour said the dogs would chase and bark after people who walked past the house.

Another said if the snakes escaped up a tree, the children were forced to go up and get them.

A third person said the couple's fighting was a 'non-stop thing'. When police arrested Holmes, they had to pull them apart.

The children have been temporarily placed under the custody of the city's Administration for Children's Services.

All the animals were removed from the house and are being cared for by the Animal Care and Control Department.
