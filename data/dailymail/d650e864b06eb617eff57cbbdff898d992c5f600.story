Lives could be put at risk due to cuts in food safety inspections and testing, according to the expert leading the horsemeat scandal inquiry.

Hundreds of trading standards are being lost as part of local council cuts, while public analyst laboratories, which conduct food safety tests, are being shut down.

The cuts come at a time when food fraud, as demonstrated by the horsemeat scandal, is a rising and posing a threat to the health of consumers.

Trading standards officers are involved in policing the cleanliness of food outlets and takeaways as well as ensuring food is what it claims to be on a label or menu.

It is claimed that cuts in some London boroughs mean that just one trading standards officer is responsible for monitoring thousands of food businesses.

The Government appointed Professor Chris Elliott, who heads the Institute for Global Food Security, in Belfast, to lead the independent review into last year’s scandal where horsemeat was passed off as beef in burgers and ready meals.

He is concerned about anticipated cuts of 40per cent to the UK Trading Standards Service, which could mean the number of officers falls from a high of 3,000 in 2009 to around 1,900 by 2015.

Prof Elliott said: ‘What we have to be careful of is that the budget cutting gets to a point where the integrity of our supply chains, the safety of the food that people eat, gets compromised to such a point that people start to die.

‘I certainly hope that it doesn’t happen and all the indications are at the minute that the food industry is stepping up to the mark. 

‘They’re doing more checking and testing; but the food industry can’t do it on their own.  What we need are strong regulators and well-resourced regulators.’

Prof Elliott says the Food Standards Agency should be given new powers to tackle fraud in the food industry

His concerns echo those of Andy Foster, from the Trading Standards Institute, who said: ‘You take money out of sampling, you take money out of inspection, you take money out of the consumer protection system.

'You will get increased levels of fraudulent activity and you make the consumer protection regime that’s designed to deal with it much more impotent – and that’s a big concern.

‘When you have some authorities – like some in London – operating on one trading standards officer, how on earth can they possibly deal with all their demands, from fraudulent activity?’

Prof Elliott has recommended that the Food Standards Agency be given new powers to tackle fraud through a Food Crime Unit.

Speaking on the release of his interim review in December, he said: ‘The UK food industry is currently too vulnerable to criminals wishing to perpetrate fraud.

‘Not enough evidence is collected about food crime and we don’t yet know the extent of how this global problem affects the UK food and drink market, worth £188billion.

‘Estimates of the level of criminality vary, so further investigation needs to be a priority.

‘We need a culture within businesses involved in supplying food that focusses on depriving those who seek to deceive consumers.

‘Government, and in particular a more robust Food Standards Agency has a major role to play partnering these efforts.’

The gaps in consumer protection will be highlighted in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight.

The FSA’s chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, tells the programme that Prof Elliott makes a valid point. ‘He is right to be concerned about the level of trading standards officers keeping food safe.

There has been a reduction in the number of officers. There has been a reduction in the amount of sampling,’ he said.

However, Mr Rhodes said a ‘very strong’ network of food safety checks does still exist.

‘It’s increasingly risk-based, it is being helped by better intelligence and that will be one of the keys to unlocking some of the issues that we face,’ he said.

The food and farming department Defra, insisted Britain’s food is safe.

A spokesman said: ‘Professor Elliott’s interim review recognises that UK consumers have access to some of the safest food in the world we want to keep it that way.

‘In the last year, we have taken action to prevent food crime, including increasing unannounced inspections of meat cutting plants and boosting funding to £2 million to support local authorities’ food sampling programme.’
