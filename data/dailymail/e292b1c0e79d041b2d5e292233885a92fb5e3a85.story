Ched Evans: Would your team sign him after he was snubbed by Oldham Athletic? 

Steve Bruce has risked sparking outrage by publicly questioning the conviction of rapist Ched Evans.

The Hull City boss, who admits he was among the three Premier League managers to support Oldham in trying to sign Evans this week, challenged the unanimous verdict of the jury and the three judges at the Court of Appeal by saying he thought the 26-year-old had a strong case to have his conviction overturned.

Evans’s case has gone to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. But Bruce delivered his own verdict after Oldham became the third club to step back from signing a player released from prison after serving half a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman.

‘I might be upsetting people but there is a question of the rape and how he’s been convicted by a jury,’ said Bruce.

‘When you look at the evidence, it is there for appeal. It has divided opinion. When you look at the case in detail then Ched has a case.’

Bruce made an important mistake in his remarks. The Evans case is not there for appeal. It is up to the CCRC whether the case is referred to the Court of Appeal, and so far only three per cent of the 18,753 investigated have been referred.

Bruce confirmed he had spoken to Oldham chairman Simon Corney — an old friend — and offered his support to the League One club prior to the chaos that erupted at Boundary Park this week.

‘Simon has looked at the case and evidence and he was of the opinion to give the kid a chance,’ Bruce said. ‘I’m a big believer that if you have done your time, you’ve done your time. Everyone deserves a second chance.’

Ched Evans affair has been made even worse by giving in to the mob 

The Evans case could now lead to the introduction of a Code of Conduct for professional footballers in England.

Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, said yesterday he would ‘encourage the game’ to look at that option.

The FA introduced a code for the England players in 2012, but a wider code would need approval from Premier League and Football League clubs as well as the Professional Footballers’ Association.

‘Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable,’ said Dyke. ‘This cannot be overstated.

‘We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in detail at the FA and we have examined the legal requirements and our rules and regulations and there is no basis for us to intervene directly.

‘That said, it is important we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognise the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a (player).

‘I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct. The FA will certainly be considering it.’

Currently, the FA do not have the legislative powers to intervene but they can push for the introduction of a code, even if the clubs would ultimately remain the moral arbiters.

The governing body would want any code to focus less on the idea that players are role models but instead that they should recognise that it is a privilege to play professionally and the need to protect the game.

The PFA’s main concern was to calm the storm created by ill-advised comments from chief executive Gordon Taylor.

In an interview with the BBC on Thursday Taylor made the mistake of comparing Evans’s plight to that of the Hillsborough families, which sparked calls for him to resign.

Taylor was branded ‘a disgrace’ by Hillsborough family members, while Sheila Coleman, for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said his comments were ‘insensitive and crass’. Taylor apologised on Friday but succeeded only in causing further offence and was forced to issue a second apology on the PFA website.

Dr Phil Scraton, primary author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, said: ‘Taylor apologised for any offence he may have caused. He then proceeded to compound yesterday’s crass, insensitive and wholly inappropriate comments by stating that, “Ched Evans is a totally different case but he has the same belief of his innocence”.’

Taylor, 70, responded by offering to telephone each family to apologise personally. ‘The last thing I intended was to upset anybody connected to the Hillsborough tragedy. I can only apologise,’ he said.

Asked if he had considered resigning, Taylor said: ‘Not all, not while I’m trying to do my job with the PFA.’
