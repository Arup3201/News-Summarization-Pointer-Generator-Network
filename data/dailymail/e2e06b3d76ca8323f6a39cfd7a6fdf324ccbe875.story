Two machete-wielding thugs have been jailed after they attacked an innocent father caring for his disabled son at their home after mistaking him for a drug dealer.

Samuel Madine, 25, and 18-year-old Mark Kirkwood intended to steal a drugs haul in the raid but got the wrong address and attacked the unsuspecting father at knife point as he protected his 14-year-old child.

The victim had been at home in St Annes, Lancashire, watching TV when the pair along with a third accomplice burst into his flat and hacked at the father's arm, shouting 'Where's the stuff?'

They then ransacked the property with the victims insisting they had no idea what the gang was talking about.

The men also stole a wallet, watch and a bluetooth speaker.

The father and son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were so traumatised by their ordeal, that the boy refused to return home.

The father also suffered blood poisoning from a wound in his elbow inflicted with the machete and his son's medication had to be increased.

At Burnley Crown Court, Madine, of Blackpool admitted robbery and was jailed for six years and four months.

Kirkwood, also of Blackpool, was convicted of two counts of robbery after a trial and was sentenced to eight years in prison.

They had almost 100 previous convictions between them.

Prosecutor Richard Bennett said the incident began at about 9.45pm on May 10 last year when the father and son heard the sound of breaking glass.

The father went to check to see if he could see anything, found nothing, so both ignored the noise.

But about 30 minutes later, the pair were in the lounge watching television when they heard voices.

The father went into the hallway and saw three men standing at the top of the stairs.

The first man immediately rushed at the him agitated and shouting, 'Where’s the stuff?'

Mr Bennett added that the father was pushed back onto the sofa next to his son and the first man then produced a machete and began to wave it around.

The father was struck on the arm while his son was hit on the leg and his shin was gashed.

The 14-year-old was also struck in the face with the handle of the machete and he suffered a smashed tooth. 

The second man in the gang had a baseball bat while the third man was armed with a carving knife with a six inch blade.

The prosecutor said the defendants made off having snatched the father’s wallet and £85 cash. A watch and Bluetooth speaker were also taken as well as both victims’ mobile phones.

The father and son then waited a couple of minutes to make sure the intruders had left before dialling 999. They were taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries.

Mr Bennett explained: 'A blood smear was found on the wall near to the entrance of the flat which transpired to come from Madine. Kirkwood’s fingerprints were on the inside of the entrance door of the flat. Madine was arrested on May 15.

'He was interviewed and declined to comment, except to admit the blood stain would have come from him. 

'Kirkwood was arrested on November 19. He also declined to comment to the police when he was interviewed.'

The prosecutor read a victim impact statement, where the father, who is his son’s full-time carer, told police: 'This incident has had a massive effect on both our lives.'

He said his son suffered from several medical conditions. The father went on: 'On top of his other issues, he was particularly affected by the fact he had to attend court.'

The father said the blood poisoning made him feel very unwell and he had to take antibiotics.

He continued: 'My son was completely unable to return to our home address. He has never been back and it’s caused us to move.

'At home I am anxious and constantly on edge, as if anticipating somebody is going to come through the door at any time.'

The father also explained how he now had to take a tablet to sleep and the teenager’s medication  had to be increased.

He added: 'He just doesn't want to spend time in a room on his own.'

Mr Bennett also added Madine had 51 offences on his record and Kirkwood had committed 31 previous offences, including robbery.

The pair were jailed for a total of 15 years at Burnley Crown Court, pictured, for their part in the attack on the father and son 

The third man in the raid had not been apprehended. No property was recovered.

Brendan Lally, for Madine, said immediately before the offence he had suffered the loss of a number of people who were dear to him and his father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Mr Lally said: 'He couldn't handle it and took drink and drugs to gross excess.

'The defendant wasn't issuing threats and wasn't involved in the planning of the offence. He is easily led and somebody who has deficits in terms of his ability to make decisions. He struggles in day-to-day life in terms of self-management.'

Mr Lally said Madine’s father died two days after his arrest and added: 'The defendant is ashamed of his behaviour and he does appear to genuinely want to address his offending. He maintains he got involved very shortly before this offence took place.'

Defending Kirkwood, Tom Lord said his client was 'immature and susceptible to pressure'.

He added: 'He sought security from older, pro-criminal males and that is something that is identified as a catalyst for him becoming involved in this offence.

'He was a courier for a lot of older people and he delivered drugs. He accrued a drugs debt. He is an immature young man who was led astray by older, influential males, to whom he looked up.'
