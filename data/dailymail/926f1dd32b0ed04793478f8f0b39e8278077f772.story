Forget your rivalries between Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Co on the pitch. Off it, the  battle to be broadcast between those in the Premier League remains as cut-throat as ever.

Sky Sports and BT Sport's announcement of 25 live fixtures  between December 2 and New Year's Day means we have our diaries at the ready, but which matches are worthy of being pencilled in?

Winter promises to be far from dull for Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle United fans, but those at Burnley, Hull City and West Brom may feel aggrieved to find themselves losing out.

As the Premier League elite soak up the viewing figures, fans of Burnley, Hull and West Brom have been dealt a particularly bad hand.

They are the only clubs to be snubbed by BT Sport and Sky Sports, closely followed  by Aston Villa and Crystal Palace with one game apiece.

Chelsea, current favourites to win the Premier League ahead of reigning champions Manchester City, find themselves joint top with Manchester United and, slightly surprisingly, Newcastle.

Jose Mourinho - never one to shy away from the spotlight - appears to have gotten the better of rival manager Manuel Pellegrini.

The 'Special One' and his side verse Newcastle, Stoke, West Ham, Southampton and Tottenham in their five TV fixtures.

City, on the other hand, find themselves on the box just three times when they face Everton, Crystal Palace and Sunderland. That won't help season ticket holders, however, given all those matches are at the Etihad.

Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers have fared better than Pellegrini, too. The managers of Arsenal and Liverpool have four live matches apiece, including against each other at Anfield on Sky Sports on December 21.

In the red half of Manchester, though, manager Louis van Gaal best get used to Sky Sports and BT Sport cameras being present to capture - and scrutinise - his every move.

United have a hectic Christmas period on the box, taking on Southampton, Newcastle, Tottenham, Stoke and, surely the pick of the lot, Liverpool at Old Trafford on December 14, won by Sky Sports. 

It seems the most undesirable fixtures fall on a Monday, though, with Van Gaal among the victims.

Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea (Thursday, January 1, BT Sport, 5.30pm) 

He and his team travel to Southampton, Queens Park Rangers go to Everton, Chelsea make their way to Stoke and Swansea have Liverpool all on Monday nights, making it difficult for away fans with long journeys home afterwards.

As for Newcastle, under-fire manager Alan Pardew may not welcome the additional pressure, particularly in games against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and an Everton side looking to recapture their Champions League-chasing form of last season.

Schadenfreude? Perhaps, but the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland on a dominant day for Sky Sports on December 21 means late Christmas shopping should be avoided.

BT Sport look to have won the bragging rights for Boxing Day and New Year's Day, however. They snag the majority of games on both prime days, including a tasty Manchester United vs Newcastle clash and a London derby between Tottenham and Chelsea.
