Yasmin Prest: 'Case wouldn't have been necessary if Michael had been fair'

A British oil tycoon lost his landmark divorce battle against his ex-wife in the Supreme Court yesterday and was ordered to pay her £17.5million.

Michael Prest, 50, one of Britain’s most successful black businessmen, argued that he could not pay his former wife as his assets were owned by his companies, not by him.

But the court ruled that property worth £11million was held ‘in trust’ for him by companies he controlled and owned and ordered their transfer to Yasmin Prest, 49.

Yesterday’s ruling sets a precedent because it reverses a previous judgment that had barred Mrs Prest from obtaining the properties as they were separate legal entities under corporate law.

That decision had raised the prospect of wealthy husbands being able to ‘bury’ their assets in companies they own to protect them from generous divorce settlements.

The Prests, who have four children, have spent almost £3million in legal fees contesting the divorce settlement following the break-up of their 15-year marriage in 2008.

The Supreme Court heard that the couple were based in London but also had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean and lived to a ‘very high standard’.

Mrs Prest had been seeking a payout of more than £30million, plus more than £730,000 a year to meet the ‘reasonable needs’ of her and their children.

Mr Prest, whose business was valued at £2.5billion in 2007, had offered her £27,000 a year and a lump sum of less than £2million.

In 2011, the High Court ordered that Mr Prest should transfer a £4million property in London to his wife and make a lump sum payment of £17.5million.

He was told to transfer seven UK properties owned by his company, and worth £11.3million, to his wife to partially meet the lump sum payment. The tycoon was also told to pay maintenance of £24,000 a year for each of his four children, along with school fees and medical bills.

His companies challenged the High Court 
decision and won their case in the Appeal Court. But it led to Mrs Prest
taking the battle to the Supreme Court.

The case revolved around the
question of whether courts had the power to treat assets owned by a 
company as belonging to the person controlling the company.

Marriage 
law states that assets to which the ‘party is entitled, either in 
possession or reversion’ can be transferred to a spouse in a divorce 
settlement. The court concluded that the properties were held ‘on trust’
for Mr Prest by his companies and that the ‘particular circumstances’ 
of this case allowed them to order the transfer of  the assets.

The 
judges reflected on the High Court’s criticism of the businessman in 
their ruling, saying he had failed to comply with court orders ‘with 
particular regard to disclosing evidence’.

They said: ‘The court 
inferred that the reason for the companies’ failure to co-operate was to
protect the properties, which suggested that proper disclosure would 
reveal them to [be] beneficially owned by the husband.’

It found 
that Mr Prest had employed ‘obstruction, obfuscation and deceit’. Mrs 
Prest, who still uses her married name, looked visibly relieved as the 
judgment was read out yesterday and said it was ‘more a case of 
satisfaction’ than celebration.

‘None of this would have been necessary 
if Michael had been sensible and played fair,’ she said.

Lawyers said that today's decision would have far-reaching implications for couples divorcing in the future

Her lawyer, 
Jeremy Posnansky QC, said: ‘The Supreme Court’s decision will ensure 
that dishonest husbands can’t cheat their wives and flout court orders 
by hiding behind a web of deceit and a corporate façade.’

Mr Prest 
did not attend. His lawyer, Martin Pointer QC, argued that the 
companies’ assets were ‘held in trust’ for his children and those of his
siblings under Nigerian law.

He argued that a £10,000 bequest from 
his Nigerian father after he died in 1992 was the ‘seed money’ that 
built his oil empire and his brother has begun a separate claim. Several
of Mr Prest’s companies are also appealing against the divorce payout.

Lawyers said today's ruling would have important implications for divorcing couples in future

Lawyers today spoke of the far-reaching impact of today's Supreme Court ruling.

Tom Farley-Hills, family partner at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis, said: 'If the Court of Appeal decision created a "Cheat's charter" by allowing someone to hide their assets behind the corporate veil, this ruling has ripped it up.

'It says husbands who use company structures for dishonest purposes will come unstuck.

'It also says that even when husbands have assets held within a company but who are not trying to circumvent claims by their spouses dishonestly – the nature of those assets and how they became corporate assets will be looked at closely by the courts to establish true ownership...

'It should allow spouses where their spouse has put assets used by the family into a structure to sleep a little more easily.'

Alison Hawes, a specialist family lawyer at law firm Irwin Mitchell, said the ruling was a 'landmark'.

She said: 'The ruling confirms that, if someone is the sole owner of a company, then if the court is satisfied that those assets are held by that company on trust for one party, they can be used as part of a divorce.

'It means that business people cannot deliberately "hide" their assets in businesses and corporate structures to protect them in future in the event of a divorce.'

Michael Hutchinson, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown, said: 'The Supreme Court has handed down a landmark decision in which, for the first time since at least the end of the19th century, it has accepted a general exception to the rule against 'piercing the corporate veil'.

'This is an extraordinary decision and the implications for corporate governance are potentially huge.

'Businesses and lawyers will be poring over the judgment for some time to try to understand its limits.'

Marilyn Stowe, a senior partner at Stowe Family Law, went on: 'The Supreme Court's decision is a victory for common sense.'
