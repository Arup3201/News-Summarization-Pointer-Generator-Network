Legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo believes the Premier League is the perfect place for young talent from his country to develop, despite spending much of his European playing career in Spain and Italy.

Brazil coach Dunga picked five players from the Premier League in his most recent squad, including three from league leaders Chelsea – and the two-time World Cup winner encouraged more Brazilian youngsters to try their hand in England.

Ronaldo spent time with Barcelona, Real Madrid, both Milan clubs and PSV during his career in Europe but has lived in London after retiring from football.

‘It’s definitely the right thing to do (Brazilians coming to the Premier League),’ the 98-cap striker said at a Poker Stars event in central London.

‘Because of the nature of the football here, which is a lot of tackles, a lot of attacking and forward play, it’s definitely a good decision for young Brazilians to come to the Premier League.’

Chelsea midfielders Oscar and Willian as well as left back Filipe Luis all started for Brazil as they beat Austria 2-1 in a Vienna friendly on Tuesday night, and Ronaldo feels that at club level, Jose Mourinho’s tutorship is ideal for Brazilian players.

Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas both pulled out of Spain’s squad for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus and Tuesday night’s friendly with Germany, but ‘The Phenomenon’ had no problems with the Portuguese coach’s leadership.

‘Under Mourinho’s coaching, they (Oscar, Willian and Luis) have a lot of potential to do well because of Mourinho’s nature,’ he said.

While Oscar, Willian and Luis are topping the table with Chelsea, Ronaldo was not quite so lucky in his PokerStars duel with Rafael Nadal, losing out on the £32,000 ($50,000) charity prize to the Spanish tennis star at London's Hippodrome Casino.
