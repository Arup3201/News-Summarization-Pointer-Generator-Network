A woman who has been charged with bestiality after police found footage on her mobile phone of her allegedly having sex with a dog has returned to her Queensland home.

Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug, the Courier Mail reports. 

The 25-year-old arrived home and exited the black sedan, clutching a red bull can and dressed in a black singlet, pink shorts and black thongs.

Driscoll appeared at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday

Driscoll was accompanied by an unidentified man, who exited the car along with a dog, and was dressed in a red shirt and black shorts and had a backpack. 

The dog,  believed to be a pitbull terrier, climbed the stairs to Driscoll's cream coloured residence, where neighbours say she has lived for some time.

Driscoll entered her house and remained for a very short amount of time, before leaving with the man in the sedan. 

Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos, and appeared at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday.

‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland.

‘Under the Animal Care Protection Act bestiality isn’t included. To take action and remove the dog we would have to prove actions there were cruel or that it was tormented.’

‘The RSPCA would ideally like to get a dog out of the situation if bestiality was happening, but to operate under the act we would have to prove those two things.’ 

‘We’d try to do everything we can to help the dog if that is the case.’

Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. 

She was granted bail but will have to report to police once a week and live at an apartment at Enoggera, south-west of Brisbane. 

Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. 

Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson. 

It was when police were investigating the text messages they located the videos of Driscoll allegedly having sex with the dog. 

She will reappear in court in December.
