Art is usually a labour of love for the creator.

But one muse showed her devotion to creativity by lying spreadeagled and naked in the middle of a pig farm.

The result was an aerial project - shot by photographer John 
Crawford between 1984 and 1987 - showing his then wife Carina 
pictured from a bird's-eye perspective.

Captivating: The photo project showing a nude from the air has gone viral on the internet

After locking the 35mm colour 
negatives and prints away in a box, they have finally seen the light of 
day, a quarter of a century after the project's completion.

And now the photo project has gone viral on the internet.

Kiwi photographer Mr Crawford spent most of the mid-1980s flying from job to job in small planes.

It gave him a unique view of the odd symmetry found on the ground - sparking the unique project titled 'Aerial Nudes'.

Mr Crawford, 61, from Taranaki, New Zealand, said: 'From my school days I had been interested in graphics, strange patterns and shapes.

'Looking down from a hovering helicopter you see the landscape from a birds eye perspective and suddenly everything becomes abstract and symmetrical with no distracting horizon line.

Work of art: Mr Crawford would rope in favours from friends to help create the stunning series - including mates rates on a Jet Ranger helicopter and hiring tractors for a ploughed field scenario

All for art: The photographer's wife lies down on stacks of piping in a piece called Yellow Pipe in Taranaki

'I thought strategically placing a nude in these locations would emphasise the point that we as human beings are so minuscule and insignificant in relation to the enormity of the planet we live on.'

Locations for the project included a runway, a railway line and a moving car weaving through traffic.

Each one was meticulously planned, with Mr Crawford scouting potential locations from the air during his day job as a commercial photographer.

After spotting a good area, he would return to photograph it in more detail - before trying to persuade land owners to let him shoot a nude there.

Mr Crawford added: "To pull it off we had to wait for the right day. It had to be flat overcast light, not too windy.

Family connection: Due to the reaction online John now plans to return to the project - using his 27-year-old daughter Amelia to pose naked on a Boeing 747

Taking his time: On why the project has taken so long to reach a wider audience, John revealed: 'When I started the series I thought they were pretty cool, but I like to mull things around in my head'

Rediscovered: 'Revisiting the images 25 years later was certainly a buzz,' said the photographer

'Shooting above a local airport I had to talk the air traffic controllers into diverting incoming flights, and when I was shooting the nude on the runway the control tower suddenly filed up with men and binoculars.'

Every shot is as it appeared to John on that day - no photoshop or trickery, just a camera.

Mr Crawford,said: 'People ask me if I used Google Maps or a drone, but it is all from nothing more than a camera, no photo editing at all.'

On why the project has taken so long to reach a wider audience, Mr Crawford revealed: 'When I started the series I thought they were pretty cool, but I like to mull things around in my head.

'As a photographer you get very close to your work. You think about it, proof it, enlarge it and print it, then you get sick of it.

'I just put these photographs away a lot longer than normal. Revisiting the images 25 years later was certainly a buzz.'

And thanks to the reaction from fans online after posting them on his website, Mr Crawford now plans to return to the project - using his 27-year-old daughter Amelia to pose naked on a Boeing 747.
