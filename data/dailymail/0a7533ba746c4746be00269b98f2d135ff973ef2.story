Brendan Rodgers hailed Liverpool’s fighting qualities after they overcame a huge fright to make a winning Champions League return.

Steven Gerrard held his nerve to fire in a last-gasp penalty, which secured a 2-1 win against FC Ludogrets, but that was only after Liverpool had conceded a 90th minute equaliser to substitute Dani Abalo following another defensive mix-up.

Mario Balotelli had earlier opened the scoring but while he was delighted to get Group B off to a winning start, Rodgers admitted there was significant room for improvement in the quality of Liverpool’s performance.

But the Liverpool manager did say his side would have to improve tactically in the Champions League

‘If you can win your home games and pick up points away from home, it gives you a chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are not at the standard we were last season. We have a lot of players who have come in and are still adapting. We are a work in progress.

‘I thought we showed great determination. At times we had quality and then in the final third we couldn’t make that final pass. Tonight was about perseverance, an attribute you need to have. We kept going. It is a competition that is about winning and winning games. Sometimes you will play well and not get a result.

‘It was very important to be back in the competition. It was always going to be a tricky tie. Technically they were very good. We had to show patience, change the shape from 4-3-3 to a diamond. Mario gets a great goal. I am disappointed with the equaliser we conceded

It was Liverpool's first Champions League match since they lost to Fiorentina at Anfield in 2009

‘But maybe in the first six months we would have drawn but we showed the experience and character in the group, the young kid (Javier Manquillo) in the box pushing hard to get something and he gets his reward in the penalty that Stevie scores.’

Balotelli came to life after he scored his goal, almost grabbing another with a thumping drive, and Rodgers believes the goal will do wonders for his confidence following his high profile switch from AC Milan.

‘Mario is used to scoring,’ said Rodgers. ‘He had two games when he hadn’t scored. I just feel with him, he needs to be in the box more. I said to him at half-time “make sure when the ball is in wide areas, make sure you are penalty spot and in”

‘He is 6ft 3ins and great in the air. He shows great touch and the finish was a wonderful touch. On top of that I thought he worked very hard. He is still trying to get fit but he showed us his quality.’

Ludogorets thought they had secured an unlikley point after Dani Abalo scored a late equaliser

After conceding an equalise in the 90th minute, Steven Gerrard than converted a penalty to win it 

Rodgers, whose side now travel to FC Basel – thumped 5-1 by reigning champions Real Madrid – on matchday two, admitted that Liverpool have to learn to concentrate until the very end if they are to achieve his target of progressing to the knockout stages.

‘No question,’ he said. ‘I think certainly tactically there are questions asked. This is a tournament where mistakes get punished. We made one. The home games are very important for us. Away from home you have got to be compact and impose your style on the game. That is very important.

‘Anfield cranks itself up in terms of the noise level on nights like this. I am happy for the supporters; they are back in the competition they are synonymous with. It was a wonderful occasion and great to have that feeling of being back in the competition.’
