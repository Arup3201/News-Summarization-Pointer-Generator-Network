It is a game normally played with toddlers.

But Benny the bulldog proved he too can enjoy a game of peek-a-boo as he played with his owner - who captured the whole thing on video. 

The adorable 32 second film shows the puppy perched at the edge of a mahogany table in the living room of his owner. 

While the sound of the television reverberates behind the canine, Benny has his head faced in the opposite direction towards his owner and the accompanying video camera.

The Bulldog's characteristic small ears and large head can be seen immediately as the video commences, however, it is only after eight seconds that he raises his head enough so that his eyes are visible.

Benny looks directly at the camera as he prepares to quickly lower his head again during the humorous video

But as soon as he sees his owner looking at him, he lowers his head again.

But seconds later his head is bobbing upwards as he tries to see if his owner is still watching him - before dropping down again.

During the brief footage Benny the Bulldog  plays peek-a-boo and bobs his head up and down four times with his owner.
