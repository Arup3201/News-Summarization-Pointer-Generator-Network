Charged with murder: John Hicks, 19, stands accused of killing the two men

The second victim of a shooting during the first Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans died of wounds to his neck, as police charged a 19-year-old with his murder.

The unnamed man died Friday morning after spending the night in hospital after John Hicks, allegedly drew his weapon and opened fire.

Yesterday night the first victim, an unnamed 21-year-old, died last night from bullet wounds to his chest.

Hicks has been charged with two counts of murder and one of illegally using a firearm, the New Orleans Police Department said.

Officers say Hicks starting shooting around 10pm Thursday during the first round of celebrations on St Charles Avenue.

The two men are seemingly the only ones who were hurt in the attack.  

Both were taken to hospital. The 21-year-old died during surgery as doctors fought to save him.

Thursday night the 22-year-old was said to be in a critical condition, but his death was confirmed Friday morning.  

Police arrested Hicks last night but did not name him until he had been charged. Officers say they found a gun near the scene of the crimes.

The shooting occurred during the Muses parade, the traditional kick off to the Carnival weekend on St Charles Avenue. 

The New Orleans Advocate reported that two or three shots could be heard, which sent the crowd scrambling and saw frantic parents herding their children to safety.

Police then descended and administered CPR to one of the victim's in front of a Popeye's restaurant as a young woman cried nearby. He was then taken to hospital by emergency services.

The suspect initially attempted to flee along but was caught at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Baronne Street. 

Officers stationed nearby also responded immediately and barriers were set up, but the parade still rolled on.

Angela Matherne, a resident of Thibodaux, Louisiana, was taking in the parade with family when the shooting happened a block away. 

Ms Matherne said she didn't hear anything 'but saw people running in our direction and police in the opposite.' 

She added that the parade kept going so she didn't realize there had been a shooting until later, when she left the parade route.

The city will host several parades daily until Mardi Gras, which is on Tuesday.
