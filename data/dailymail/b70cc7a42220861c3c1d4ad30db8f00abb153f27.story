'Possessive' Nathan Lloyd put revenge porn on his ex-girlfriend's Instagram account, changed the password so she could not take it down and then called her a 's***' when she asked him to remove it

A dumped boyfriend who posted a 'revenge porn' picture of his ex-lover online has avoided jail and was instead ordered to attend a 'building better relationships' course.

Nathan Lloyd, 22, put up a photo of his former girlfriend in her underwear on her Instagram account after they broke-up - then changed the password so she couldn't take it down.

Despite a move to make the offence subject to a two-year prison sentence, he walked free from court today  after being told to attend a course where he'll learn about 'aggression and relationships'.

Lloyd,  of Narberth, west Wales, was sent the picture of the woman while he and she were still together.

But after they split up, he logged into her account on the photo sharing website and uploaded the picture.

Lloyd also posted a video 'of a sexual nature' onto the page, magistrates heard.

A court heard how he then changed her password so she couldn't remove the revealing image.  

Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard Jones said: 'When they were together the defendant had access to the victim's Instagram account.

'She ended the relationship because she found him possessive and his behaviour unnerving.

'She became aware that he had posted pictures of her Instagram account. She was unable to change the password and to get into her account and remove them, which she was very upset about.'

His victim begged Lloyd to take the image down from her Instagram where she had around 500 followers.

But Haverfordwest Magistrates Court heard that Lloyd responded with a torrent of abuse.

Mr Pritchard Jones added: 'She sent him another message asking him to take it down. He replied: "F*** you, s***".'

Despite government moves to increase sentences for the offences, Lloyd walked free from court today after being told he would have to attend a 'building better relationships' course with probation workers

The course is made up of 24 weekly or half-weekly sessions, divided into four modules, called 'Foundation', 'My Thinking', 'My Emotions' and 'My Relationships'.

The probation service says the course's aims are to 'help offenders gain a better understanding of themselves [and] show them how their personal issues play a part in the violence they show to their partners'.

The course description also states it 'supports offenders to discover their strengths and build on them to improve their relationships and helps offenders to develop their skills and learn new ones to overcome difficulties.'

Lloyd admitted breaking the Telecommunications Act by sending an obscene or offensive image.

He also admitted charges of criminal damage and resisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

The court heard how he was arrested after kicking his ex-girlfriend's door down when she refused to let him in.

Lloyd was given a restraining order and told not to contact the victim or post anything about her on the internet.

He was also given a 24-month 'Building Better Relationships Order' and told to pay costs totalling £145.

Lloyd's case comes ahead of new legislation, expected to come into force later this year, that makes revenge porn a specific offence which could carry a maximum sentence of two years.

In December, the CPS launched new guidelines on tackling domestic abuse which will include using technology to inflict misery on former partners.

Under the new guidance, prosecutors will be encouraged to consider how revenge porn can be treated as a form of domestic abuse.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said last year: 'We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side.'

Luke King was jailed for posting the explicit image

Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws.

It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament.

It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. 

Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught.

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. 

Last year, Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three-year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images.

King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.
