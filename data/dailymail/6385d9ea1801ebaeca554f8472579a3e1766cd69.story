An investigation into the Hillsborough disaster and the way in which South Yorkshire Police handled its aftermath has found that another 55 officers may have had their statements about the tragedy altered.

The Hillsborough Indepedent Panel inquiry had already identified 164 ammended accounts from officers in September last year, but a subsequent probe by the Independent Police Complaints Commission has found evidence of additional changed statements.

The panel had originally found that 116 of those 164 statements had comments 'unfavourable' to South Yorkshire Police changed or completely removed.

New claims: A fresh probe by the Independent Police Complaints Commission has said that another 55 police officers may have had their accounts of the Hillsborough tragedy, pictured, amended

The IPCC said that the new statements are currently being analysed and investigators will begin interviewing the 164 officers who have already been identified as having their story changed later this month.

Ninety six Liverpool fans were killed in a crush at Sheffield’s Hillsborough stadium on April 15 1989 during The Reds’ FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.

The IPCC announced on October 12 that it would be launching an independent investigation into allegations surrounding the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, following a review of the panel’s report.

The investigation is reviewing allegations surrounding amendments to statements, the actions of the police officers after the disaster and the role of West Midlands Police and those who investigated what happened at the time.

A separate team led by by former Durham chief constable Jon Stoddart is investigating a range of organisations involved in the preparation for the event and what happened on the day.

Probe: The IPCC investigation was launched after the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel found a cover up of the tragedy's aftermath

The IPCC is managing the strand of the investigation looking into the actions of the police.

In its monthly update, the IPCC said its Hillsborough Contact Team had received more than 230 pieces of correspondence since October, more than 50 relating to statements.

Deborah Glass, IPCC deputy chairwoman, said: 'The IPCC knows the people who have contacted us are the tip of the iceberg.

'Therefore preparations are ongoing for an appeal for witnesses to the disaster and this is expected to be conducted in the autumn.

'The preparations will include work with appropriate agencies to provide welfare support where needed to those who will have to recount the traumatic events of 15 April 1989.'

Search for the truth: Fresh inquests are to be held into the deaths of the 96 who died next year. Family members of those were killed and survivors have campaigned for more than two decades for justice

The IPCC has recovered 97 per cent of the documentation originally supplied to the panel and identified additional documentation not previously disclosed.

The watchdog's investigators found documents belonging to West Midlands Police, which was involved in the investigation in the last few months.

Investigators have now asked for confirmation that no more undisclosed documents are in existence.

The police watchdog expects to have a team of 70 to 100 staff on the investigation.

Fresh inquests into the deaths of the 96 victims are set to begin by the end of March next year at an as yet undecided venue in the north west of England.

Last December, verdicts of accidental death from the original inquest in March 1991 were quashed.

The action was taken after the Hillsborough Independent Panel studied thousands of documents and reported there had been a huge cover-up of what happened at Hillsborough and its aftermath.
