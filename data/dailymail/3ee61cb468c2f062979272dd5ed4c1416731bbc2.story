They say you should let sleeping dogs lie - advice that one driver in China paid the price for ignoring.

He drove back to his home in Chongqing to find a stray dog lying in his favourite parking spot, so he got out and kicked it.

However, as far as the dog was concerned, that was not the end of the matter. 

A driver in China had his car attacked by a stray dog he'd kicked the previous day

Ruff justice: The dog that was kicked brought reinforcements

It returned later on with some of its pals and proceeded to exact its revenge by chewing the bodywork and windscreen wipers of the car belonging to his attacker.

The vandalism was photographed by a startled neighbour, who showed the driver the next morning the evidence that a series of dents and marks on his car were caused by a pack of hounds.

Stray dogs in China are sometimes grabbed off the street and thrown into dog fights.

China has no animal cruelty laws, and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody.
