It may traditionally be seen as an excruciating conversation, but 80per cent of American parents say they've had the ritualistic 'sex talk' with their teens and pre-teens.

According to a new study conducted by Planned Parenthood and New York University, of those who had discussed the birds and the bees, 80per cent had done so by the time their kids were 13, and 50per cent before their kids were ten.

Encouragingly, and perhaps a sign of the times, 'most' of the parents and youths questioned claimed they 'didn't feel embarrassed' talking about sex, reports TIME. 

No sweat: It may traditionally be seen as an excruciating conversation, but 80per cent of American parents say they've had the ritualistic 'sex talk' with their teens and pre-teens

This is 'great news,' Planned Parenthood's vice president of education, Leslie Kantor, said of the study, which assessed a 'nationally representative' sample of 1,663 parents with their children aged between nine and 21.

Still, 20per cent of parents admit they've never talked to their 15 to 21-year-olds about birth control or 'strategies for saying no to sex.'

And over 30per cent hadn't informed their kids on where to access reproductive health services.

Interestingly, 45per cent of parents advised their kids to wait until they were married before losing their virginity - only three per cent of the population manage this, according to a 2003 government poll - while 61per cent of parents said they wanted them to wait 'until they can handle the responsibility.' 

Ms Kantor did point out that as a result of our digital age, kids and teenagers these days are exposed to a great deal more coverage on sex - both good and bad - than we once were.

Indeed, according to Enough, a nonprofit which advocates stricter internet regulations, 79per cent of youths have been exposed to online porn in their own homes.

In a recent interview, actress Jennifer Garner - who is mom to Violet, nine, Seraphina, five, and Samuel, two - said on the subject: 'The scary thing to me is what's available to them online.

'Even if they could run across it accidentally, [it] could show them something that is not connected to the way I want them to see sex.

'I want them to see sex as something joyful... a celebration of love and of their bodies.'

Ms Kantor suggests using mediums like TV to initiate a conversations about sex with their children, rather than avoid it.

'Even if the show is sending a terrible message, it gives you a chance to get in there with something else,' she says.

And for those teens - or their parents - who still squirm at the prospect of having 'the talk,' particularly in any level of detail, Planned Parenthood has set up a 'chat and text' program.

This enables young people to chat in real time with Planned Parenthood staffers about anything sex-related - a service which has initiated 393,174 conversations in the U.S. since its launch in May.
