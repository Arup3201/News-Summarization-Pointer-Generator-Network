Maybe it was on too late. Or maybe it was on too long. Whatever the reason, thousands of viewers snubbed Downton Abbey on Christmas Day.

Although it had been tipped to be a runaway ratings success, the ITV1 drama was beaten by five other shows.

The period drama recorded its lowest ever viewing figure and was watched by almost a million fewer people than last year’s Christmas special, managing only 7.3million.

Unforeseen: Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and his wife Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) and their baby in TV drama Downton Abbey. Matthew had just left the maternity hospital when he was killed in a car crash

It was soundly beaten by EastEnders, which was shown at the same time and attracted 9.4million viewers.

Downton was also trounced by Coronation Street, Strictly Come Dancing, The Royle Family, and Doctor Who.

It pulled in the same number of viewers as rival BBC1 drama Call the Midwife, whose viewing figures were also a record low.

This year’s Christmas Day ratings were a triumph for low-budget soap operas.

Downton costs around £1million an episode to make, compared to soaps such as EastEnders, which cost around £200,000.

The Christmas ratings battle was 
dominated by the BBC, which drew in almost a third of the peak-time 
viewers, compared to a quarter who watched ITV. The corporation had 
seven of the top ten programmes.

However it is believed that many more 
viewers recorded Downton Abbey, preferring to watch it after it had been
broadcast to avoid the frequent advert breaks.

ITV has previously been 
criticised for broadcasting one minute of commercials for every three 
minutes of the programme.

Despite the dramatic storyline – which
included the death of Dan Stevens’s character Matthew Crawley after 
becoming a father – fans said the two-hour episode was too long.

Others said the decision to broadcast it from 8.45pm made it too late for many families.

It is the lowest ever viewing figure for the programme, which has performed well on Sunday evenings.

The previous lowest was the third 
episode of series one in 2010, which got 8.9million viewers. The 
highest-rating episode was the finale of series two which recorded 
12.4million.

One fan wrote on Twitter: ‘As much as I
love Downton Abbey I really can’t be bothered with two hours of it.’

Another, LennyBow, wrote: ‘I looked forward to the Downton Abbey 
Christmas special, but I came very close to turning it off altogether. I
stuck with it for the four seconds of action that happened right at the
end. I won’t be watching again.’

It is the fourth year in a row that EastEnders has triumphed in the Christmas Day ratings.

Last year, the Downton Christmas 
special pulled in 8.1million viewers and was the fourth most watched 
programme.

However, viewing figures were also down for many other shows.
EastEnders lost half a million viewers compared to 2011 and its 
Chritsmas Day ratings were thought to be the lowest for a decade.

Call The Midwife drew its smallest 
audience since launching earlier this year and Doctor Who, on 7.6million
viewers, also had an average audience 1.3million lower than in 2011, 
although it was shown almost two hours earlier in the day.
