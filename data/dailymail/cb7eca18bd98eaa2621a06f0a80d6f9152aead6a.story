We have just had our wettest winter on record. Now forecasters are warning of a drought.

Parts of southern Britain could face little or no rainfall for up to ten days, says the Met Office.

The Environment Agency last night warned people to ‘use water wisely’ to ease demand.

According to the Environment Agency we have just had the wettest ever winter since records began

The UK is expected to bask in warm temperatures and dry conditions due to an area of  high pressure that is likely to last into next week.

An absolute drought is defined in the UK as a period of at least 15 consecutive days where there is no more than 0.2 mm of rainfall.

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘We’ve certainly got, at least this week in the very far south, a  likelihood of very little rain.

‘The South West is looking unlikely to see any rain, certainly up until Sunday, and then as we go into next week there is a strong signal that we’re going to be sticking with some drier weather.

‘It’s not necessarily a heatwave because there is quite a lot of cloud around, but there is very little rain around, effectively.

‘Until Sunday, it will be relatively dry with some showers, and next week, a very similar picture. There is very little rain forecast for the next week to 10 days.’

However, sun worshipers can expect a ten-day bonus as there is little to no rain forecast for the next week to 10 days in the south east

There is a possibility of showers in northern England tonight, which may spread to parts of Wales, East Anglia and the North East.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘Despite recent warm weather, river and groundwater levels across England are all at normal levels thanks to the wettest winter on record.

‘Water is a precious resource and it’s always important to use it wisely, but especially during hot, dry weather which can lead to increased demand for water, pressure on the environment and supplies.’

Despite balmy weather in the south, rain is still predicted in other parts of the country.

The Met office has forecast showers in northern England on Tuesday night into Wednesday, which could spread into parts of Wales, East Anglia and the North East coast.

There may also be further rain around the Midlands on Thursday morning and in parts of the South and the southern coast tomorrow.
