The huge array of hidden cameras used by a top doctor to spy on colleagues and patients in hospital toilets emerged yesterday.

Voyeur Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh was jailed for using 23 secret cameras to film his victims, including James Bond-style devices disguised as memory sticks, pens, watches and hearing aid boxes. He also fixed tiny cameras to toilets, bins and sinks and even filmed visitors to his £750,000 home.

Over more than three years, world-renowned hearing specialist Yeoh – who worked in NHS and private hospitals – amassed thousands of hours of footage of more than 1,000 men, women and children.

Depraved NHS consultant Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh, 62, spent three years filming more than 1,000 patients, colleagues, friends and even children as young as three in intimate moments

Judge Warwick McKinnon at Croydon Crown Court condemned Yeoh's 'nefarious and despicable actions' as pictures of the high-tech devices he used in his perverted spying were released by police

The consultant surgeon’s downfall came after he inadvertently filmed himself putting a camera in a communal toilet at the private St Anthony’s Hospital in North Cheam, South London. The incriminating footage was found when the device fixed by Blu-Tack fell off and was spotted by a colleague.

Yesterday married Yeoh, 62, of Banstead, Surrey, who pleaded guilty to voyeurism on Tuesday, was given an eight-year sentence at Croydon Crown Court. It comprises a five-year jail term and three years on extended licence after his release during which he will be supervised in the community. He can be returned to prison if he breaks the terms of his licence.

Afterwards victims said they had been left feeling dirty and violated by his abuse. One former colleague, who asked to be called Sarah, said the experience had changed forever the way she behaves in public. ‘I can’t go to the toilet in a public place now without looking for hidden cameras,’ she said.

Sarah, 33, worked with Yeoh for ten years and was filmed by him between 15 and 20 times without her knowledge or consent.

Once she found a pager belonging to him in a communal toilet at work and, assuming that he had innocently left it behind, returned it to his office. She now believes the device was left deliberately to spy on her. Sarah added: ‘It’s strange watching him in the dock, people say he looks broken but how remorseful can you be after it’s been going on for so long?

Police found 23 covert cameras, which were disguised as computer memory sticks and pens 

The cache of secret cameras also included three hidden in hearing aid boxes in his car

‘It felt good to stand there with some of the other victims – it was a real strength in numbers.’

Another woman, who worked with Yeoh for 12 years, said he made 47 videos of her. She said: ‘He spliced videos of me talking and laughing with videos of me using the toilet where we worked.’

Recalling the moment police asked her to watch the videos back to identify herself she added: ‘I felt frozen. I felt dirty as though I had been raped by him. I felt disgusting.

‘I knew the only way I could be free of him was to face him in the dock and see him vulnerable and small, just like he made me feel.’

The doctor, who is originally from Malaysia and boasted that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star Michelle Yeoh was his half-sister, bowed his head throughout the hearing, shielding his face and refusing to look at his victims. Sentencing Yeoh, Judge Warwick McKinnon condemned his ‘nefarious and despicable actions’ and said he had disgraced the hospitals where he worked.

He said: ‘The breach of trust is vast and far reaching as well as the distress, sense of betrayal, anger, and disgust at the appalling breach of trust, at the personal and intrusive nature of your actions.

‘Your actions brought the establishments you worked in into disrepute.’

In what police described as calculated and clearly orchestrated actions, Dr Yeoh had invited people to his home to secretly film them in the bathroom. He carefully labelled and edited his footage, some of which was of children as young as three, and stored it on his NHS computer for his sexual gratification.

Yeoh, an expert in tinnitus, vertigo and dizziness who is also known by the first name Robin, was arrested at St Anthony’s Hospital after an investigation by police in April.

On Tuesday he admitted seven counts of voyeurism, six of making indecent images of a child and one of possessing extreme pornography relating to 32 identified victims and a further 1,084 who have not been identified.

His wife Ivy, 57, had a voyeurism charge against her dropped.

Yeoh has been based at the NHS St Helier Hospital in Carshalton where he ran a regular clinic.

In addition to St Anthony’s, he has worked at the private Cromwell Hospital in Chelsea and the Portland in Central London. He is an honorary senior lecturer at St George’s medical school in Tooting, South London, and has given expert evidence in cases at the High Court.

Yeoh has admitted using a sophisticated network of cameras hidden in hospital toilets to spy on 1,000 patients including children at St Anthony's hospital

The voyeurism charges relate to 30 identified victims and 1,084 unidentified victims, while the charge of making indecent images of children relates to six children

Colleagues of the voyeur doctor told of their horror yesterday at discovering he had been secretly filming them for years – and even giving some video clips a star rating system.

Three women, who worked at a top private hospital, said Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh's actions had left them feeling 'violated'.

They also told in excruciating detail how they had to watch Dr Yeoh's videos to identify themselves. In them, he had edited together clips of them chatting to him at work with clips of them using the toilet.

The women were told in April that Dr Yeoh had been arrested but it was not until October that they found out they featured in his videos.

One victim, in her forties, said: 'He would write a name then a brief description on each video. Some descriptions we didn't understand because it was your name and then, for example, five stars next to it. Apparently that was how on show you were. It is so surreal and shocking, it is hard to actually believe it.'

Describing how she had to watch the videos with two policemen, she said: 'I felt shocked, traumatised and then very sick.

'I could not finish watching the video. I was not prepared for what I saw. I think there were 43 videos of me, in the office, on the toilet. When the police left I felt disgusted. I felt dirty. I was utterly disgusted. I wanted it to go away.'

Another victim, in her thirties, said: 'You have lots of emotions – if you use public toilets, you look around a bit more.

'You should feel comfortable doing that. I don't work there any more but I don't think I could return.'

The two women who have returned to work said they found it 'very difficult'.

'When we returned to work, we found the Blu-tack he had used to fix the cameras,' said one. 'Luckily the toilets where he filmed are being refurbished now.'

All three women described Dr Yeoh as 'creepy' and 'socially awkward'.

The woman in her forties, who had worked with Dr Yeoh for 12 years, said: 'I was absolutely convinced from the very beginning [that I was one of his victims] because of his very creepy behaviour. He would come into my office many times and would stay in the office on his own after I had left and I was thinking, 'what is he doing on his own in the room for two minutes?' '

The three women were among 19 of Dr Yeoh's victims who were in court yesterday. One said: 'It did help. He was in a vulnerable position – the roles were reversed.'
