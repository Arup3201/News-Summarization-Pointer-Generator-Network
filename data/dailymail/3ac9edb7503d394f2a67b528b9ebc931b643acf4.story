 Very few ancient crafts are beyond the power of modern science - almost every single one has been bettered by industrial processes.

The painstaking process of creating a samurai sword - reforged hundreds of times by hand - is one. Another - until now - has been the Stradivarius violin.

Scientists puzzle over why the 650 Stradivarius violins still in existence sound so good - but after two years of CT scanning, and computer-aided carving, scientists have 'recreated' one for the first time.

'Blind' tests have shown that Stradivarii are not always the best violins in existence - but their consistently high sound quality still baffles experts.

Some believe it's due to unique woods used by Antonio Stradivari, or to shaping or wood thickness in particular parts of the instruments - others believe that its due to chemical processes used to treat them.

CNC equipment carves ultra-precise models using 3D 'scans' - and can produce a near-perfect replica based on scans of an original object. Even so, the replica was finished by hand

A new study by the Radiological Society of North America might help unravel the mystery of the violins - without destroying the precious instruments in the process.

Most Stradivarii are stored in museums, and are never played.

This summer, one of the instruments sold at auction for $15.9 million.

The team from the RSNA used advanced computer X-Ray tomography imaging to create a 3D 'scan' of the violin - both inside and out.

The CNC equipment worked from a 3D model created from 1,000 X-Rays to replicate every nook and cranny of the instrument

The 1704 violin was then reconstructed using computer-aided machine tools.

'CT scanning offers a unique method of  imaging a historical object - in a non-invasive way' said Steven Sirr, M.D., a radiologist at FirstLight Medical Systems.

'Combined with computer-aided machinery, it also offers us the opportunity to create a reproduction with a high degree of accuracy.'

Antonio Stradivari, an Italian who lived from 1644 to 1737, is regarded 
as history's greatest violin maker.

Of the estimated 1,000 violins 
Stradivari made, about 650 still exist and are highly prized for their 
unique sound quality.

There are many theories but no simple explanation 
for the superiority of the Stradivarius.

Some believe it's simply the wood Stradivari used.

Many factors influence a 
violin's sound - from the qualities of the wood to the instrument's 
shape, degree of arching and wood thickness.

To create a violin with the same characteristics as the 1704 instrument known as 'Betts' Dr. Sirr worked with professional violin makers John Waddle and Steve Rossow of St. Paul, Minnesota.'We have two goals: to understand how the violin works and to make reproductions of the world's most prized violins available for young musicians who can't afford an original,' Dr. Sirr said.

The original violin was scanned with a 64-detector CT, and more than 1,000 CT images were converted into 3D image files, which can be read by a computer-controlled tool called a CNC machine - a carving device controlled by computer code.

The CNC machine, custom-made for the project by Rossow, then carved the back and front plates and scroll of the violin from various woods.

Finally, Waddle and Rossow finished, assembled and varnished the replica by hand.'We believe this process of recreating old and valuable stringed instruments may have a profound influence upon modern string musicians,' Dr. Sirr said.

The Betts Stradivarius is held in the U.S. Library of Congress.

Dr. Sirr, an amateur violinist, first scanned a violin with CT out of curiosity.'I assumed the instrument was merely a wooden shell surrounding air,' he said.

'I was totally wrong. There was a lot of anatomy inside the violin.'

This revelation may help not only to build cheap reconstructions of the violins - but help design new generations of instruments.

After he shared those first CT images with Waddle in 1989, the two spent years scanning more than 100 violins—including 29 valuable instruments pre-dating 1827—and other stringed instruments to better understand their composition.'Just like human beings, there is a wide range of normal variation among violins,' Dr. Sirr said.

'When you are looking at an instrument that is hundreds of years old, you will see worm holes and cracks that have been repaired.'

There is also damage from being exposed to all kinds of conditions, from floods to wars.'

For owners of authentic Stradivarius or other prized violins, CT imaging not only provides a definitive form of identification, it helps establish a pedigree that may increase the value of their investment.

Most are collectors items, sold at auction for huge sums, or stored in museums.

Dr Sirr's process may also help preserve the remaining Stradivarii.

'CT is useful in measuring wood density, size and shapes, thickness graduation and volume measurements,' Dr. Sirr said.

'It also provides detailed analysis of damage and repair.'
