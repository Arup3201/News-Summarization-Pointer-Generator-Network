Fearne Cotton launches her latest collection of block colour dresses and patterned separates for Very.co.uk.

The radio and television presenter, 32, models an array of bold and versatile pieces in hot pink, turquoise blue and clashing prints for Autumn Winter 2014.

Fearne, now in her fifth year working with the online retailer, is pictured in a distressed home setting for the rock chick inspired shoot.

Fearne Cotton wears her simple, chic and sixties inspired A-Line Scuba Dress in a punchy pink hue, £29

Standout styles from her 14th range include a hot pink scuba-style dress, cut in a 60s-inspired style of high neckline and short hemline.

Fearne, who has been designing for the brand since 2009, wears a leather jacket slung over her shoulders and a glam, smoky eyed beauty look for the campaign picture.

Her latest range features a clashing floral print pant and kimono suit, with checkerboard lapels. The kooky ensemble is styled with monochrome sandals and a pink cami, modelled on Fearne.

Fearne 
makes up part of a stellar line-up of guest designers for Very.co.uk, 
which also include her best friend Holly Willoughby and new recruit 
Rochelle Humes.

Her collections are known for their everyday wearability but with a touch of her signature edge.

'If I'm feeling confident, I like to wear something daring and bright,' says Fearne.

'My collection is all about having fun with your clothes - dressing in a way that makes you feel empowered and your best.'

A
 spokesperson for Very.co.uk said: 'At Very we pride ourselves on 
helping our customer lead a stylish life, and one of the ways we achieve
 this is by giving access to exclusively designed collections at great 
prices.

'Fearne's collection is always eagerly anticipated and we are expecting this season to be another huge success.'

New bride Fearne married Jesse Wood, with whom she is a parent to 17-month-old
 son Rex, in a lavish London summer wedding earlier this 
month.  

And she glowed with newlywed happiness during a photocall for the collection on Wednesday afternoon.

She showcased her AW14 collection to fashion media with an 
exclusive cocktail party at private members club, The Groucho Club in London, wearing a sunshine yellow prom dress, £79.

The
 DJ and designer stepped out for photographers sporting the piece from her latest range
 - perfect for a wedding guest outfit - ahead of her appearance.

The pretty retro frock featured a structured bodice, tulip sleeves and a voluminous, short skirt, showing off her endless, toned legs. Waist embellishment made the look extra glam.

Fearne styled it with pretty pastel makeup with frosty pink lipstick, and fuchsia high heel sandals.

Fearne's collection is available online now. Prices range from £25-£79, and sizes go from 8-16
