Google has shown off a picture taken with its 'Project Glass' techno-glasses - hi-tech specs that 'layer' computer information over the world.

The glasses also have a camera built into the arm - used by project leader Sebastian Thrun to capture a picture of his son.

'We announced Project Glass in part to let our team start testing prototypes outside the office,' says the Project Glass team, via its Google Plus page, 'Sebastian Thrun, one of our project leaders, tried one out last weekend and we just had to share the result.'

'We’d love to hear about the types of moments you'd capture if you didn’t have to wait to pull out a camera or your phone,' says the team.

The prototypes are also being tested 'in the wild' by Google co-founder Sergei Brin, who was pictured weariing a pair of the glasses.

The wraparound glasses feature a 
miniature display that sits above one eye, allowing users to surf the 
internet, make video calls, listen to music and update the diary without
lifting a finger.

The screen is controlled by voice and by tilting your head, so one catch may be a few funny looks in the street.

A
prototype is being tweaked and tested in public by the company’s 
employees before it goes on sale.

The technology is known as ‘wearable 
computing’ and is expected to launch a new generation of gadgets which 
display a layer of information over everything the wearer sees – 
bringing together the search engine, GPS tracking, a phone and a camera.

In demonstrations, the glasses are mainly voice-controlled, using voice commands to bring up contacts, send emails and search

The glasses appear to run a variant of the Android operating system, using the same microphone icon and other recognisable parts of Google's mobile OS

'We think technology should work for you—to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t,' says Google.

The glasses layer 
information 'over' the world, and offer directions - as well as allowing
users to 'locate' one another in the real world, as with Google's 
current Latitude system.

'A
group of us from Google X started Project Glass to build this kind of 
technology, one that helps you explore and share your world, putting you
back in the moment, 'says Google.

The service lets you locate nearby friends in a similar way to Google's current Latitude service

'We’re sharing this information now because we want 
to start a conversation and learn from your valuable input. So we took a
few design photos to show what this technology could look like and 
created a video to demonstrate what it might enable you to do.'

Various leaks had hinted that Google wanted to move into wearable computing.

'Many
of the features - voice commands, embedded camera, Google Maps 
integration - have been previously rumored, but it’s compelling to 
actually see them in action. Whether they will work quite as well in 
reality is, so far, uncertain,' says ZDNet.

No release date has been confirmed for the glasses - nor has Google explained exactly how the glasses work.

The glasses also allow users to record and share videos from a built-in camera, just like on YouTube

 'Google X' is where the search giant's scientists work
on wild, out-there ideas.

'Google
has always invested in speculative R&D projects - it's part of our 
DNA,' said a spokesperson when the first news of the lab leaked.

'While
the possibilities are incredibly exciting, the sums involved are very 
small by comparison to the investments we make in our core businesses. 
In terms of details, we don't comment on speculation.'

The lab is reportedly located in Google's Mountain View, California headquarters - known as 'the Googleplex'.

Engineers
are free to work on projects such as connected fridges that order 
groceries when they run low - or even tableware that can connect to 
social networks.

Other Google engineers have reportedly researched ideas as far-out as elevators to space.

Google
co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly deeply involved in the lab. His business card is said to be simply a piece of silvery 
metal decorated with the letter X.

Brin, a robot enthusiast, once attended a conference via a robot with a screen showing his face.

It's
not unusual for tech companies to have 'ideas labs' hidden away from 
their ordinary workers - at Apple, for instance, Jonathan Ive's design 
lab where devices such as iPads are perfected, is guarded as if it was a
weapons facility.
