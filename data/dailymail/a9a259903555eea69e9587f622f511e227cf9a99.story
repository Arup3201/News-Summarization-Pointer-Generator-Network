Treasure hunters are raising a glass or two after they discovered a couple of bottles of classic wine dating back to before the Second World War while they were exploring a Nazi bunker. 

Exploring the cramped maze of Third Reich of tunnels near Swinoujscie, a city in north-western Poland, the pair of local history buffs stumbled across a narrow corridor which had not been entered for around 70-years.

Poking around, they found an old helmet, some uniform buttons and hidden in a rotten box containing ammunition, two bottles of 1930s Bordeaux wine.

In the cramped entrance to a Nazi bunker where they made the discovery, a Polish treasure hunter holds the vintage wine he found near Swinoujscie, a city in north-western Poland

The red 1938 Chateaux Grand Barrail Lamarzelle and the white 1939 Chateau Latour-Matillac were found hidden in a rotten wooden ammunition box

The pair had to squeeze through a tight entrance to get into the maze of tunnels used by the Third Reich during the war

One is a red 1938 Chateaux Grand Barrail Lamarzelle, while the other is a white 1939 Chateau Latour-Matillac.

The pair declined to be named in local media. 

Experts are divided on whether the wine would be pleasant on the pallet or little more than vinegar. 

Polish sommelier Tomasz Kolecki Majewicz, 49, said that the temperature underground would make the bunker would have preserved the wines perfectly, adding that he thought if they were opened the vintages would taste fantastic.

The entrance to the bunker was well camouflaged. Inside they also found a soldier's helmet and some uniform buttons

Polish Sommelier Tomasz Kolecki Majewic thinks the temperature inside the bunker would have been perfect for preserving the wine, making it perfectly drinkable if the bottles are ever opened

Others were not convinced. 

"I personally think it probably isn't worth drinking but there are still people that might want to take a punt,' said Izydor Wysock, 45. 'Of course there are those that would never want to open it and simply want to have such a historical bottle in their collection.' 

Even if the wine has gone off, it is thought the bottles would still fetch several hundred pounds at auction.
