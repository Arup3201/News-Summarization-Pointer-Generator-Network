The Royal Navy’s second new aircraft carrier is to be brought into service instead of being sold off.

The unexpected announcement about the 65,000-ton HMS Prince Of Wales was made at the Nato summit in Wales.

The Queen launched the first of the two new vessels, HMS Queen Elizabeth, in July, amid concerns over whether Britain could afford the £6.2billion cost for both carriers.

NATO leaders agreed Friday to set up a rapid reaction force as part of efforts to reassure allies rattled by the Ukraine crisis

After coming to power in 2010, David Cameron had wanted to scrap one of the carriers as part of defence cuts.

The previous plan was that the ship would be sold off or mothballed.

But the Prime Minister told a press conference at the summit’s conclusion that yesterday’s decision will ensure there is always one carrier available.

‘They are an investment in British security, British prosperity and our place in the world, transforming our ability to project power globally whether independently or with our allies,’ he said.

But the Government still faces criticism because the carriers will not sail with combat jets until at least 2020.

Meanwhile, at the summit the Nato members also pledged to reverse the trend of declining defence budgets. All 28 countries agreed to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence. 

The summit ended with an announcement by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko that a ceasefire agreement had been reached with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country.

But Mr Cameron said that sanctions against Russia agreed by the European Union last weekend and due to be detailed later today will go ahead, with the possibility of them being withdrawn if the ceasefire holds.

The summit in Newport saw Nato agree to establish a new high-readiness ‘spearhead’ force able to deploy thousands of troops in a matter of days.

The alliance is also preparing to ‘pre-position’ supplies of fuel and ammunition in bases in eastern Europe, in moves designed to counter the threat of Russian aggression and provide reassurance to Nato members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Mr Cameron confirmed that the UK will provide a battle group and a brigade headquarters for the new spearhead force, as well as 3,500 personnel to take part in exercises in eastern Europe between now and the end of 2015 as part of a Nato effort to ensure a persistent presence in the region.

He said: ‘We will continue our efforts to support Ukraine, including by providing financial assistance to improve their command, control and communication capabilities.

‘Nato members across Europe - particularly in Central and Eastern Europe - have been reassured that this is an Alliance that will meet its treaty obligations to come to the defence of any member under threat.

‘No-one will leave here with any doubt that our collective security is as strong as it has ever been. The Alliance is firmly committed to providing ongoing reassurance to our eastern allies.’
