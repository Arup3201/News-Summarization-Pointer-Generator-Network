A little-known Scottish photographer who became the first person to picture casualties on the battlefields of the Civil War has finally been recognised in a new book.

Alexander Gardner, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, risked his life to capture the conflict on film but was robbed of most of the credit by his employer.

Gardner emigrated to the United States in 1856 and captured some of the most startling images on the bloody battlefields of Antietam and Gettysburg.

But most of his work was attributed to his boss Matthew Brady, who was the manager of a gallery in Washington.

As the 150th anniversary of the end of the war draws nearer, a new book giving an incredible account of the pioneer's work is set to finally give him the recognition he deserves.

Author Keith Steiner, from Banff, Aberdeenshire, said yesterday (Tue): 'I wanted to right an injustice.

'Most of the photos you see of the American Civil War were taken either by Gardner or his Scottish contemporaries but he was the greatest of them all. He was never given the credit.

'When I was a teenager I found his photographs quite an eye-opener; they had quite an impact on me.

Gardner has come under fire for
 staging some of his most iconic images for dramatic effect by moving 
corpses and weapons for a better picture.

One of his most famous photographs,
 'Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter', has been argued to be one such fabrication.

Critics, having compared it to other images, claim he moved the body some 40 yards into the more photogenic surroundings of the Devil's Den to create a better composition (see the two pictures below).

However, others have argued thatÂ  that the manipulation of photographic settings in the early years of photography was not frowned upon and in no way detracts from his achievements as a photographer.

Is this the same soldier?

'I retired as a teacher and had an opportunity to explore the sites where he took his photographs.

'They were a sensation at the time and I believe the photographs have relevance in modern times.'

Gardner was born in Paisley in 1821 and trained as a jeweller before moving into the world of newspapers.

An idealist and socialist, he formed the left-leaning newspaper the Glasgow Sentinel in 1851.

His keen interest in photography led to him emigrating across the pond in the hope of furthering his career.

He was headhunted by Brady and at the outbreak of the war was well-positioned in Washington.

He was recruited as a staff photographer by General George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, and made history on 19 September 1862 when he took the first photographs of casualties on the battlefield at Antietam.

In 1863, Gardner split from Brady and formed his own gallery in Washington with his brother James.

In July of that year, he photographed the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg, developing images in his travelling darkroom.

Retired teacher Keith, 60, said: 'Gardner was essentially a photojournalist.

'He had to process and develop the photographs on the move and in the middle of a battlefield which was not easy.

'He was highly regarded and Walt Whitman once said that he 'saw beyond his camera'.

'I wanted to assert his prominence in the history of photographers.

'He is overlooked and most of my Scottish colleagues have never heard of him. That's a big problem.

'As a Scotsman, he was a pioneer.

'He was an artist, in some ways a scientist and a publisher. He was the complete package.'

Gardner was also the official photographer to President Abraham Lincoln.

He captured him seven times, including
 before his inauguration in March 1861 and in February 1865, just weeks 
before he was assassinated.

The
 war-time leader personally visited Gardner to have his photograph taken
 every year instead of the Scotsman visiting the White House.

Keith said: 'Most of the photographs you see of Lincoln were taken by Gardner and chart how he aged physically.

'He was pictured in 1861 then a few years later and it is like a different man.

'In February 1865, he is a broken man and has aged about 20 years through the stress of the civil war.

'It is an incredibly revealing photograph.'

Gardner died in Washington DC in 1882 and is buried there.

Keith began work on his book 'In the Footsteps of Alexander Gardner at Antietam and Gettysburg' after retiring in 2008.

As part of his research, he travelled to the USA to visit the bloody battlefields which his unsung hero had photographed.

He also recreated some of the historic images, highlighting that not much has changed.

Keith added: 'It was an absolute privilege to stand on the same sites that Gardner photographed.

'If you go at the right time, nobody else will be there and you get a sense of the weight of history.

'Some of the sites were very intimate and the battlefields are incredibly well preserved.

'History has given Gardner a raw deal and it is time for him to be properly recognised.'
