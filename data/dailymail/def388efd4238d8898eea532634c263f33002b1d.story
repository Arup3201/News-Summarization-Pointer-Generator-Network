Stepping down: Labour's candidate for Kingswood Josie Channer, pictured, has stepped down due to unpaid parking fines

A Labour Party candidate has stepped down after it emerged she has more than £2,000 in outstanding parking fines.

Josie Channer is currently a town councillor in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham where she also sits on a committee overseeing parking issues.

She been selected to fight the key seat of Kingswood in Bristol at the next General Election.

But today it emerged that she has failed to pay ten parking fines imposed over the last three years, which including late payment charges total £2,000.

Ms Channer has now decided not to contest the Tory-held seat of Kingswood in Bristol because of the financial difficulties she is facing.

In a statement she said: 'It is with regret that circumstances mean that I cannot devote the time and resources necessary to the task of winning back Kingswood for Labour in 2015.

'I have therefore decided to stand down as Labour’s candidate. It was a great honour to be selected by local Labour Party members to stand.

'It has been fantastic getting to know the residents of Kingswood and the local Party members.

'I wish them well as they continue to fight for the Labour victory Kingswood deserves and needs in 2015.'

The Labour candidate accrued 10 £30 fines in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.

The councillor said today that further penalty charges and interest caused the total bill to spiral.

She said: 'A few years ago I incurred some parking charges in London, queried them and believed the matter to be closed.

'Last year I learned that the charges were still live and had incurred late payment fees so I have contacted the council and agreed a repayment plan to pay off the fine.'

Conservative-held Kingswood is a key marginal seat and one of Labour’s top targets for the next General Election.

Today, Barking and Dagenham Council confirmed that Ms Channer did have outstanding parking fines and fees but could not disclose more details for data protection reasons.

Kevin Beazer, the regional secretary of the Communication Workers Union, campaigned for Labour’s second-placed candidate in Kingswood, Rowena Hayward.

He said: 'I think questions have got to be asked about when a candidate’s selected, if there is anything untoward that is going to come forward.

'It’s unfortunate... but it has happened and people will need to move on, hopefully very swiftly, so we can get a candidate in place that tackles the Tory.'
