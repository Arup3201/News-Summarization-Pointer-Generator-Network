Chilling home surveillance footage has revealed the moment a teenage trespasser broke into a home and then watched a baby boy in his crib as his parents slept.

The would-be burglar can be seen pointing a flashlight towards the two-year-old boy after coming across his crib in the home in Flint Hill Drive in Katy, near Houston, Texas on the morning of April 5.

After briefly pausing while looking down at the little boy, the suspect then turned away and continued looking through the home for items, eventually leaving with a laptop.

The Le family were stunned when they learned just how close the alleged burglar came to their son.

Frightening: A teen trespasser approaches a toddler's crib after breaking into a Houston-area home

Chilling: He can be seen pausing to look over the sleeping boy and pointing a flash light in his direction

'As soon as I knew we'd been broken into, I went upstairs and checked him right away and I kissed him so hard,' the boy's relieved father Thinh Lee told KTRK.

The suspect, who has still not been caught, climbed into the family's home through a first-story window that had been left unlocked.

Le said he believes the teenager knew he was being filmed because he sometimes looked towards the cameras but continued anyway.

He is recorded walking from room to room in the house for about five minutes before entering the toddler's bedroom. His parents did not wake during the break-in.

Relief: The teen, who has not been caught, turns his back to the crib and continues through the house

'Theft': He finds the homeowners' laptop computer, which was later found on a neighbor's lawn

'I was infuriated when I saw him walking 
back and forth in my baby's room,' Le told KHOU. 'My stomach was turning. He's my world. I love him.'

Le said he thinks his son stirred but fell back to sleep, perhaps thinking the man was his father.

He said it didn't bear thinking about what could have happened if the little boy had cried, sending his parents upstairs to check on him.

The burglar left the home before moving onto another house in the area, which also had an unlocked window.

Resident Crystal Cox said she and her boyfriend were stirred when they heard her dog bark differently than usual. Her boyfriend shined a laser pointer downstairs and the teenager fled.

He left his loot - including Cox's purse, a laptop bag and Le's laptop bag - on her front lawn.

Cox found Le's address inside his laptop bag and contacted him - and they began piecing the attempted stealing spree together.

Relief: Dad Thinh Le said he was infuriated to see the teenager getting so close to his young son

Together: Le, with the boy, said he ran and kissed him as soon as he learned they had been robbed

Le said that the suspect also stole $60 from his wallet.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office Safe Home Task Force is now hoping to identify the suspect, who is described as a Hispanic male between 16 and 18 years old.

He was wearing a New Era baseball cap with a San Antonio Spurs logo on the brim and has a tattoo behind his right ear, possibly of Asian characters.

If you recognize him or have any information, all Crime Stoppers at (713) 222-TIPS.
