The youngest person in Britain to survive a liver transplant has just celebrated her third birthday.

Lottie Bryon-Edmond, from Torquay in Devon, was just five weeks old when she had the groundbreaking surgery.

And now, during national transplant week, the toddler’s parents have found an unusual way to commemorate the heart-wrenching 15 days that they waited for an organ.

For the last two weeks, hundreds of green stars have been popping up all over the family’s hometown of Torquay in Devon, leaving residents bewildered.

Today, Lottie’s parents Chris, 50, and Julie, 43, lifted the lid on the mysterious appearances and urged local people to sign the organ donation register.

Mr Bryon-Edmond said: 'The colour represents the "I live I give" organisation which supports organ donation and the stars are symbolic of organ donors and their families.

'A man in a green star suit went around sticking them on houses, businesses and the Torquay model village to get people talking before the big reveal.

'The interest has been surreal and people have been desperate to get the stars - despite not knowing what they were.

'Businesses and individuals have offered to pay for them and the desperation has been a real throwback to the 15 days we waited for Lottie’s liver transplant.

'It’s on a totally different scale but the fervour seems to be the same.'

Within days the stars had generated thousands of interested followers and many theories.

'Some people thought it was to do with the Fringe festival and others thought it was to raise money for cancer,' said Mr Bryon-Edmond.

'Other people just think the star man is a loony and they are the ones that are closest to the truth.'

But despite the couple's unusual methods for raising awareness, their message is a very serious one.

Their daughter was given just hours to live after being born with toxic levels of iron in her liver and endured an eight-hour operation with a 50/50 chance of survival.

'We used to go back to our room and be panic-stricken because we didn’t know whether the next day Lottie would be dead or whether someone would say we have a liver,' Mr Bryon-Edmond added.

'You go in the next day and the little child in the next bed is dead. You have life and death thrust at you in the most horrendous fashion.

'Three people die every day because there aren’t enough organs to go around.

'Lottie came within inches of death but from looking at her you would never know in a month of Wednesdays.

'She’s here for a reason, this little one. She’s extraordinary.'
