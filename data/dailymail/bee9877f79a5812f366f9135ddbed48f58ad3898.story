Backing: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne wants the taxpayer's to see a more transparent version of the country's accounts

Britain will go bust by 2060 if Government fails to offset the impact of an ageing population with higher taxes and tough spending cuts.

As people live for longer, public finances are likely to set off on an 'unsustainable upward trajectory', the Office for Budget Responsibilty has warned in its first Fiscal Sustainability report.

The horrific prospect comes after  news that the true size of Britain’s debt mountain can be revealed today as £2trillion – nearly £80,000 a household.

Previously ‘hidden’ liabilities including the cost of public sector pensions and building projects are being published by the Treasury.

They show that future payments to retired teachers, police officers and NHS staff will cost taxpayers £1.1trillion, or £1,100billion.

The enormous figure, which is equal to 80 per cent of Britain’s output, is treble the combined national debts of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland.

The future cost of schools and hospitals built under the controversial Private Finance Initiative will pile an extra £40billion on to our debt mountain.

The £1.1trillion and the £40billion come on top of the official debt figure of £909billion. The figures will appear on the Government books for the first time when it publishes full accounts for every Whitehall department. 

The idea – backed by Chancellor George Osborne – is to give taxpayers an idea of what the public finances would look like if the state was a private company.

In 2008, Labour put the official estimate for public sector pension liabilities at £770billion – £330billion less than today.

Hard times: Britain's 26million households face combined debts of £2.049 trillion

And last March it costed PFI projects at £5.1billion – a fraction of the latest £40billion figure.

Adding the new figures to the official debt of £909bn produces a figure of £2.049trillion. That works out as a £78,807 bill for each of the nation’s 26million households.

The OBR's report was designed to look beyond its current forecasts for public sector net debt, which go as far as 2013/14.

The OBR said net debt is forecast to rise from its current level of 66.1 per cent to peak at 70.9 per cent of GDP by 2013, before it will decline again.

But as the effects of an ageing population kick in, the net debt will once again start to rise from around 2030.

The £1.1 trillion pension bill in March 2010 - equal to 78.7 per cent of GDP - was £331 billion higher than a year earlier, the OBR said.

Elsewhere, the report revealed liabilities arising from Private Finance Initiative contracts were around £40 billion - far above the £5.1 billion previously revealed.

There was a further £105 billion in provisions for potential future costs, which among other factors include the potential bill for nuclear decommissioning.

The main pressures of age-related spending are from health, state pension costs and social care costs.Health spending will rise from 7.4 per cent of GDP in 2015/16 to 9.8 per cent of GDP in 2060/61, rising smoothly as the population ages, the OBR said.

State pension costs will increase from 5.5 per cent of GDP to 7.9 per cent, while social care costs will rise from 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2015/16 to 2 per cent in 2060/61.

The OBR also highlighted the impact the new student financial support arrangements announced in December 2010 will have on national debt.

Student loans are projected to add £63 billion in today's terms to the net debt by the early 2030s but will fall to £49 billion by 2060 as the value of loan repayments rises.

The report stated that if stakes in state-backed banks - including Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group - were sold at current market prices, they would generate a loss of £13.5 billion.

The OBR added: 'Needless to say, while our remit is to look at the fiscal challenges of an ageing population, the fact that people are living longer - and longer in good health - is clearly something that society should welcome.'

‘Many people would be amazed to know that until now the government did not have a single set of accounts like any company would,’ said a Treasury source.

‘After years of foot dragging by the
last government we have finally got a true picture of the liabilities 
that have been built up for future generations.’

Officially,
the extra costs will not affect the official debt and borrowing figures
as these are measured using national accounting standards.

The
new figures also do not include future receipts from tax revenues. 
However, they will add fuel to the debate about the cost and 
sustainability of public sector pensions following last month’s strikes 
by unions which saw thousands of schools forced to close.

Ministers
say public sector pensions will remain ‘among the very best available’,
providing a guaranteed income for all employees – something enjoyed by 
very few in the private sector.

But
they argue staff must pay more in contributions and work for longer 
before drawing their pension, as most private sector workers have had to
do.

Tory
MP Jesse Norman said: ‘These are eye-watering figures. Thank goodness 
we now have the proper accounting processes now in place.

‘It
shows the monumental scale of the task face this Government and the 
extent to which the last Government failed to recognise these additional
costs in a formal way.’

Laith Khalaf, a pensions expert at 
Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The cost of public sector pensions has been 
hidden and downplayed for too long so greater transparency is welcome.’

Emma
Boon, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘These latest figures on PFI 
and the public sector pension liabilities make extremely worrying 
reading. ‘They will also make it harder for trade unions to continue to resist very necessary changes to public sector pensions.

‘The
Government has proposed moderate reforms to public sector pensions to 
make them more affordable and must also make steps to bring PFI costs 
under control and ensure that further debts aren’t racked up.’

Meanwhile,
a report from the Institute of Economic Affairs has claimed that the 
Government could make extra spending cuts of £215billion – which would 
take £7,500 off the average household’s tax bill.

The think tank has called for a 
further reduction in public spending from 50 per cent to 30 per cent of 
gross domestic product to help spur economic growth.

Legacy: Gordon Brown left British families with a huge burden of debt

The institute said 70 per cent of the public would support tougher spending cuts if it leads to lower taxes. Director general Mark Littlewood said: ‘The coalition Government should listen more to the British people in general and less to organised special interest groups that push for more government spending.

‘This poll makes clear that the public favour a dramatic reduction in the size of government and the right to keep more of their own money rather than surrender it in tax.’

The institute’s report gives a comprehensive review of government spending, suggesting large reductions in the size and scope of government activity, and allowing for correspondingly large tax cuts.

It claims that, in combination, these measures would provide for accelerated GDP growth across the medium and long term.

The publication of the debt figures coincides with the Office of Budget Responsibility’s first assessment of the long-term state of the nation’s coffers.
