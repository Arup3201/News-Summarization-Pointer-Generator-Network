A New Zealand man has claimed he was sacked from his job at a poultry factory after he filmed his colleague riding along a chicken abattoir conveyor belt as Superman.

In the video a man with yellow boots and a blue cape over his high-vis jacket, lays down on the thin white, slow moving conveyor belt and rides along until he disappears out of shot.

Tegel Foods, New Zealand's largest poultry producer, reportedly failed to see the funny side of the prank which was published on Facebook.

New Plymouth man Kaleb Parkinson, 21, recorded the video of his co-worker on September 26 and posted it online.

But unfortunately someone spotted the stunt and reported him and his friend to their bosses.

Tegel, who employs around 1,700 people in New Zealand, reportedly sacked the pair for failing to comply with health and safety, acting dishonestly and misconduct

Mr Parkinson posted the clip on Facebook again and said: 'This is wat i got fired 4 videoing this [sic]'

Slow ride: The conveyor built wasn't exactly a high-adrenaline ride 

Well-equipped: In the video a man with yellow boots and a blue cape over his high-vis jacket is seen

Sacked: After the 'fun' ride the man and Kaleb Parkinson who filmed the stunt were reportedly sacked

'On the positive dnt hav 2 work 2nite an dnt wrk at tegel ne more.oh an ne 1 no wer i kan gta new job [sic],' he joked.

In an interview with the Taranaki Daily News he revealed his friend rode the conveyor belt twice but they only filmed it once.

He claimed the plant was shutdown for five minutes and they 'decided to let off some stem'.

'I got my cellphone out of my locker and recorded my workmate riding a conveyor belt,' Mr Parkinson said.

'In the end it was just for fun, but I don't think my fall should be this hard,' he told the paper.

A spokesperson for Tegel Foods told Daily Mail Australia: 'We can't and won't comment on individual personal employment matters, those things are confidential.

'What I can say is we take employee safety extremely seriously as we do food safety, being in the food business.'
