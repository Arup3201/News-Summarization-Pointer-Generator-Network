Dismissal: Father Jose Funes, director of the Vatican Observatory, said that 'it's not even worth discussing' doomsday scenarios

The Vatican’s top astronomer has some assurances to offer - the world won’t be ending in eight days, despite predictions to the contrary.

Father Jose Funes, director of the Vatican Observatory, said that 'it’s not even worth discussing' 
doomsday scenarios based on the Mayan calendar that are flooding the 
Internet ahead of the purported December 21 apocalypse.

The 45-year-old Jesuit priest who is head of the Vatican Observatory and a scientific adviser to Pope Benedict gave the assurances in Wednesday’s Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano.

He acknowledged that the Universe was slowly expanding but that the destruction of the Earth – if it ever does occur – will not happen for billions of years. 

But he said Christians profoundly believe that 'death can never have the last word.'

The Mayan Long Count calendar begins in 3,114 B.C., marking time in roughly 394-year periods known as Baktuns.

The Mayans wrote that the significant 13th Baktun ends December 21.

A few years ago Father Funes said that extraterrestrial life was a valid area of investigation for the Catholic Church.

Father Funes said: 'Although 
astrobiology is a new and developing field, questions on the origins of 
life and the presence of life in the universe outside Earth are 
legitimate issues and merit serious consideration.

'It makes sense to see if other forms of life exist beyond the earth, but for the time being though there is no evidence to prove that such life does exist.'

In a 2008 interview with the paper headlined 'Aliens are my brother' he said: 'Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on Earth there could be other beings, intelligent ones, created by God.

'This does not clash with our faith because we cannot set limits on God's creative freedom.

'To quote St Francis, if we view earthly creatures as our brothers and sisters, why can't we speak of a brother from another planet?'

In the interview, Father Funes, who took over at the Vatican Observatory in 2006, also suggested aliens might not need to be 'saved' to enter Heaven, especially if they were 'more evolved' than humans.
