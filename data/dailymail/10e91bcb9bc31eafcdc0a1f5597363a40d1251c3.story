Sam Newman has issued an apology - of sorts - after being reprimanded by Channel 9 for exposing himself on national television on Thursday night.

The incident took place during a segment of the AFL Footy Show in which Newman was wheeled into the studio on a hospital bed wearing pyjamas. As he tried to get off the bed he exposed his genitals - he claims unintentionally.

Speaking on Triple M's The Grill Team early on Friday, Newman said he wouldn't apologise for the incident and didn't think it was overly offensive.

'I wasn't aware that anything untoward had happened and um... so I'm not sure what I've apologised for but um... in fact, I'm not apologising,' the Geelong forward-turned-TV-celebrity said.

But a few hours later he did and about turn and revealed he had been admonished by bosses at the network.

But later on Melbourne's 3AW radio station he said: 'Yep, I am apologising.

'I have been admonished as a result of it.

'I am not sure why I'm apologising but, if people have been offended by it, I can assure you that is the reason.'

'I have been severely reprimanded in the past by the (Nine Network) management and I have been severely reprimanded today (Friday).

'I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm smart enough to know recidivists are not welcome at the station and I'm on thin ice.'

Nine said in a statement: 'The Footy Show team and the Nine Network unreservedly apologise to anybody who was offended.'

The Logie-winning Footy Show, which was broadcast live on the road from Adelaide, regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of viewers. It moved to an 8:30pm timeslot last year.

Images and videos of Newman's efforts quickly spread across Twitter.

'Seeing Sam Newman's Crown Jewels on national TV is enough for me. Show has lost the plot,' one person Tweeted.

Others were offended by the role of a lingerie-clad nurse.

'Only took Sam Newman and the boys about 15 seconds to revert to being chauvinistic pigs,' another said.

'What? Sam Newman exposed his private parts on television! What a surprise, what a shock, what a crock!! #AFLFootyShow.' Deanna Williams ‚Äètweeted.

Newman's privates have previously featured on The Footy Show at least once, when he was 'dacked' by Shane Crawford in 2001.

Newman played 300 games for Geelong from 1964-80.
