A mother-of-two claims she is forced to spend £2,000 a month on the school run after her son was denied a place at four local primary schools.

Frustrated Louise Beard, 26, from Orpington, South London, says she spends around £100 per day ensuring four-year-old Archie gets to school.

But instead of walking her son to the local school like most parents, she is forced to drive 25 miles to Archie's current school in Kings Hill, Kent.

Louise Beard claims she spends £100 per school day - £2,000 a month - on the school run after son Archie, four, did not get a place at a local school. They are pictured with father Byron and little Poppy, aged two

The accounts manager  then drops her two-year-old daughter Poppy at a nearby nursery, before parking at the closest train station and getting the train to work in south Bromley - just a few miles from her home.

And at the end of the day, she has to do the entire journey in reverse, before picking them up from a childminder.

She eventually gets the children home at around 8pm - 13 hours after they leave the house every morning.

Mrs Beard said: 'It's awful at the moment. We are under a lot of stress.

'The kids are always sleeping in the car on the way. Archie is just exhausted.'

The family estimate they spend around £2,000 a month on the school run - or £100 per school day.

Every day they have to pay for:

More than 50 miles worth of petrol: Costing £5 to £10 a day

Parking at West Malling Train Station: £4

Return train ticket from West Malling to Bromley South: £21.70

Childminder: £20 at approx. £5 per hour

Nursery: £35-£50 per day

Breakfast club for two children: £5 

Total: Minimum spend of £95 per day

Mrs Beard and recruitment manager husband Byron, 30, have already spent around £12,000 on the school run since Archie started in September.

They say they spend the money on petrol, train tickets, parking, a childminder, breakfast club and nursery fees.

Now the couple are so fed up with the daily grind that they have decided they have no choice but to sell their £400,000 home and move closer to the school.

A spokesman for Bromley Council refused to comment on the case specifically. 

The spokesman said: 'Bromley Council is responsible for ensuring that children applying for a Bromley school are offered a school place.

'In common with the rest of London we have had exceptionally high demand for reception places and have worked hard to provide all parents who applied on time with an optimal school place.

'The high demand means that proximity to school criteria may have a small radius, particularly in a year with large numbers of siblings.

'The pan-London admissions scheme distributes places in a scrupulously fair and transparent way based on the eligibility criteria including the applicant's permanent address and the number of places available at each school.

'Many schools are over-subscribed and cannot offer to all who apply, and only reach limited distances under the proximity criteria.'
