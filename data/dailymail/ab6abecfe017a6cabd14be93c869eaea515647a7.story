Police are investigating an alleged sex attack on a Premier League player's girlfriend after she claimed a man crept into her hotel bedroom while she was asleep.

The suspect apparently sneaked into the WAG's room at the £250-a-night Lowry hotel, in Salford, Greater Manchester, while she was in there alone.

Police have arrested a 32-year-old hotel worker on suspicion of sexual assault but he was later released on bail 
while police continue to investigate.

Sex attack: The Premier League footballer's partner was sleeping at the £250-a-night Lowry Hotel in Salford when she was allegedly attacked

The distraught woman is believed to have returned early from a night out in the city while her footballer boyfriend stayed out.

The alleged victim thought the person in the room was her partner as he was lying next to her when she woke up the next morning.

She only later discovered that someone else must have been in the room when she asked her boyfriend what time he had returned and found it was much later. 

Star: The player who's girlfriend was allegedly attacked is an international who has played for a number of Premier League clubs

As part of their investigation, officers
will have seized CCTV footage and electronic records of when people 
entered the hotel room in Salford using the keycard.

Neither the footballer or his girlfriend can be identified for legal reasons. However, the star has represented his country at international level and has played for a number of Premier League clubs, The Sun reported.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed the alleged sex attack was under investigation.

'Police were called to the Lowry Hotel in Salford following reports a 32-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted.

'A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. He has been bailed pending further enquiries. Enquiries are ongoing.'

The alleged attack has similarities with another case in London where a porter let himself into a celebrity guest's room and raped her as she slept.

Soby John, 25,used his position as a porter to get a copy of the electronic key to the victim’s room after seeing her stumbling in the corridor. He was jailed for 10 years for the attack.

The Lowry Hotel is a favourite hangout for Premier League footballers and it is often used by away teams when they are playing Manchester United and City.

Manchester United star Wayne Rooney paid Helen Wood, 23 and Jennifer Thompson, 21,  £1,200 to sleep with them at the hotel in 2010 while his wife was pregnant.

Married former England manager Steve McClaren had an affair with a woman who also had a fling with Sven Goran Eriksson after being introduced to her at the hotel.

Father-of-three McClaren, 51, met Saima Ansari at the Lowry - the same hotel where Eriksson was first introduced to her.

The hotel was engulfed in a food poisoning investigation when 80 guests fell ill after a fundraising dinner at the hotel in 2011.

They reported suffering dizziness and vomiting after eating chicken pate at the charity event.
