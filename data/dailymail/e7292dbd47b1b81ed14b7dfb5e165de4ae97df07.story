A sprawling country estate with 600 acres of grounds, two chocolate-box cottages, and it own wooded island has gone on sale for just £8million.

Green Farm, near to the village of Ashton in Northhamptonshire, also features a seven-bedroom farmhouse and it is the first time the property has been on the market for 150 years.

Andrew Meikle, from estate agents Bletsoes, said this is a chance for people to own a picturesque piece of England 'as beautiful as anything in the Cotswolds', but for a fraction of the price.

Sprawling: Green Farm estate features this seven bedroom Grade II listed farmhouse which is set in 600 acres of grounds and farmland

Hertiage: The estate has been passed down through the generations of the Rothschild family, and this is believed to be the first time it has come up for sale in 150 years

Bargain: For £8million the buyer will also get this three-acre wooded island situated in the River Nene which is accessible by weir (left)

The estate was initially owned by the Rothschild family and is currently occupied by their descendants, having been passed down through generations.

During the 19th century, when the family were believed to hold the largest private fortune in the world, they helped to remodel the village of Ashton for the workers they employed on the estate.

The Grade II listed farmhouse is in a secluded location on the edge of the picturesque village. There are also two listed thatched cottages on the land - the three-bedroom West Lodge and one-bedroom Shepherdess Cottage.

The farmland is spread out between Polebrook, Ashton and Oundle with 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland.

The buyer would also get their own private island - three acres of woodland in the middle of the River Nene, which you can access by a weir. 

Mr Meikle said: 'As far as we know this is the first time the property has come on the open market in 150 years. It's a Rothschild property, it belongs to descendants of the family and has been handed down for generations.

Beautiful: The price tag includes two listed cottages located within the grounds, including this three-bedroom property named West Lodge

Quaint: Tucked away in another corner of the huge estate is this one-bedroom thatched property named Shepherdess Cottage

Vast: Among the 600 acres that come with the houses are 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland

'We're very open-minded about how it might sell. There are a number of properties, lots of land and it's even got an island. It's the perfect opportunity for someone to buy a bit of England.

'It's in Northamptonshire, a really picturesque, forgotten part of the country - it's as nice as places in the Cotswolds but for quarter the price.

'A local farmer who came to look at it said he can't remember anything of this size being available in the last 20 years.

'It's got some great commercial land, a lovely frontage on the river, meadows, woodlands and development potential. There's pasture land that could be used for traditional livestock, or might appeal to the equine market as well. It's got absolutely loads of potential.

'The island is three acres of mature woodland and sits in the middle of the River Nene. You cross to the island by weir.

'Viewings have been getting booked up already and we've even got potential investors coming from abroad.'
