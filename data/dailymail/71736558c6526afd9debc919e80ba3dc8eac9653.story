Her parents, Jonathan and Jayne Buttigieg, have asked their daughter to 'please call' and 'let them know that she is okay'.

There were also possible sightings of the teenager at the Tesco and McDonald's in Weston-super-Mare town centre later that evening, Avon and Somerset Police said.

'If you don't want to speak to us please call Grandma or Nanny, we just want to know you are all right.'

Detective Sergeant Phil Clarke, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'We have been making enquiries and speaking with her school and her friends but we are growing increasingly concerned given her age.

'I would appeal to Jessica to get in touch with us on 101 or to call her family.

'She's not in any trouble, we just want to make sure she is all right and reassure her family who are very worried about her.'

Jessica is described as white, about 5ft 4ins tall and slim, with shoulder-length blonde hair.

When last seen she was wearing grey trousers, a maroon sweatshirt and a black hooded top.
