The Duchess of Cambridge has become a famous fan of the British High Street and now it seems the Kate effect is brushing off on the other royals.

While Kate chose to wear maternity clothes from Topshop while pregnant, Zara Phillips has opted for a similarly budget style by shopping at New Look.

The Queen's granddaughter wrapped up in a £49.99 coat to attend the races at Cheltenham.

Sealed with a kiss: The couple celebrated the win with a smooch

Unable to compete in equestrian 
events now she's eight months pregnant, Zara has instead been 
channelling her energy into helping a race horse part owned by her 
husband become a champion.

She and her husband Mike Tindall celebrated with a kiss at 
Cheltenham Racecourse as the horse he part owns, Monbeg Dude, won the 
Majordomo Hospitality Handicap Steeple Chase.

Zara, a the
 world three-day event champion in 2006 and team silver medallist at 
last year's London Olympics, has been helping to brush up the jumping of
 the gelding.

She reportedly branded her former England rugby captain husband an 'idiot' when he invested in the horse. But she revealed at Cheltenham races today that the steed has been improving under her expert eye.

Zara, who is due to give birth to her first child next month, said: 'We have just been getting him to move his feet a bit quicker and think about it a bit more because he is a good jumper.

'You can see now that he is so much more efficient over his fences. It makes the whole race easier for him. We just did exercise poles. He has come down to me about five times. We schooled him this week and he loved it. He was bouncing out of his skin.

Used to being active: The Olympian said she has been a bit bored during her pregnancy

No riding: With her baby due next month, Zara has to be content watching the races at the moment

'My jockey (Tom David), who rides point-to-points, was riding him because obviously I couldn't. But Scu has done all the hard work, I've have just helped a bit.' 

Zara, 32, wrapped up her blossoming baby bump at the races in a woolly coatigan with a knitted cowl neck.

She teamed her cosy outfit with jeans and brown boats and carried a black handbag.

She also wore sunglasses which were on the top of her head more often than over her eyes thanks to the wintry weather.

As well as helping to get Monbeg Dude into shape during her pregnancy, Zara previously revealed she has taken up another hobby - baking.

Surprise: The couple have not found out if they're having a boy or a girl

The Olympian admitted: 'I have been a bit bored. I'm used to being on the go and active the whole time, and now it's quite different. So, yes, I'm baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.'

And Mike added of her culinary skills: 'She’s a very good cook and cooks me everything. I cook too, but I’m the pudding guy – sticky toffee puddings, chocolate fondants and brownies.

'I'm very good at following a recipe whereas Zara’s good at putting her own twist on things.'

Mike, 35, also revealed that he and Zara have no intention of finding out the sex of their baby before its birth - preferring to keep it a surprise.
