A street light has finally been turned off - after being left on 24 hours a day for six years.

The faulty lamp in Dronfield was fixed by council engineers after angry residents complained.

Local resident Wendy Davies, 64, said: 'It’s been shining into my house 24/7 for six years. What a waste of money over all that time.

'I live in a semi-detached and the light would shine straight in to my bedroom window. I haven’t been very well recently and when I’d sit in the room and look out of the window all I could see was the bright light.

'It’s been on for six solid years day and night. I’ve told the council over the years and they said they would sort it, but I think it just got put to the bottom of the pile.'

Richard Schumacher, from Sheffield based company Pro Spark Connextions, estimated keeping the light going for six years would have cost about £920.

Mrs Davies said she mentioned the problem to the council again in May and 'they agreed it was a waste'.

She added: 'Again they said they would sort it out, but they never did.

The offending street light that was fixed this week in Dronfield. The Derbyshire County Council said they were unaware of the problem and sent an engineer to fix it as soon as they were informed

'I stopped asking after a while because you start to feel like you’re being ignored. It was only when I saw the council’s plans to leave streets without light to save money that I thought I needed to do something.

'It just got me really riled up when I saw the plans and I thought how can they leave these people without light when this one is never switched off?'

A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council said: 'This was the first we heard about a problem with this light but an engineer has been out and fixed it.

'Although we carry out regular checks on street lighting at night, we need members of the public to report lights which are on at the wrong times so we can repair them.'

The spokesman said the council looked after an 'enormous amount of lights' in the county and had 'never heard of' a light being faulty for so long. 

The Taxpayers Alliance director John O'Connell said: 'Unlike the streetlight, the council needs to switch on to the fact that taxpayers will no longer tolerate poor service. 

'The amount of taxpayers' money that's been wasted on the 24/7 streetlight will rub salt in the wound. Councils have to be more responsive when local residents complain.'
