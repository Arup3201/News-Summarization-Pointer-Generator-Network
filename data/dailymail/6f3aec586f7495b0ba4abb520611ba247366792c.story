Enhancements: Josie Cunningham, 24, had a £5,000 breast enlargement on the NHS and is now in line for £2,500 of dentistry work paid for by the taxpayer

An aspiring glamour model who had a £5,000 breast enlargement on the NHS is now in line for £2,500 of dentistry work paid for by the taxpayer.

Josie Cunningham, 24, who sparked outrage when she had the operation to enhance her bust, is now pregnant after falling into a life of prostitution.

All mothers-to-be are entitled to receive free NHS dental care, and Miss Cunningham is reportedly set to make the most of the treatment on offer by having root canal surgery, a dental implant, a filling and her wisdom teeth removed.

The unmarried mother-of-two, who revealed last week that she was three-months pregnant and did not know who the father is, said she was pleased the NHS would be footing the bill for her dentistry.

'I didn't get pregnant to have my teeth sorted, but it's a massive bonus,' she told The Sun.

'I'm sure people will be annoyed that I'm accepting this freebie but I couldn't care less.'

She said that she was annoyed the free dental care would only cover a silver filling, but added: 'I guess beggars can't be choosers'.

Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, said that she was no longer working as an escort, but has admitted that she does not know who the father of her baby is.

He could either be a surgeon who paid her £1,000 for a night of passion or a friend she has casual sex with.

Miss Cunningham hit the headlines last year when she underwent cosmetic 
surgery to increase her bust from 32A to a 36DD at St James’s Hospital 
in Leeds.

The operation caused outrage, heightened further by the same NHS trust refusing to fund surgery that would enable a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk.

Before: Miss Cunningham before her breast enlargement. She says she was bullied about her flat chest from the age of 14

Daily Mail readers donated thousands of pounds to help fund an operation on Sophie Thomlinson's spinal cord after health chiefs decided that the £25,000 surgery was too expensive.

Oliver Dockerty, three, was also refused funding for the pioneering procedure, called selective dorsal rhizotomy.

Miss Cunningham has vowed to work to pay back the £4,800 cost of her operation, but has said that the £1,000 she had set aside to reimburse the Health Service has now been spent on clothes for her new baby.

Josie has previously flaunted her new breasts and even used this outfit to offer a tribute to the NHS for paying for her implants

Last week she told how she had turned to escort work at the suggestion of a friend and had slept with her fourth client, an unmarried surgeon in his mid-30s, charging him £450 for dinner and £1,000 for a night of sex.

‘I’m ashamed to say I don’t know who the father is,’ Miss Cunningham told Closer 
magazine. ‘I’ve only slept with one client, but I’ve also been having 
casual sex with a friend.’

She was still seeing two clients a week until discovering that she was expecting a baby, and has since worked on adult phone lines.

New start: Miss Cunningham said that she was no longer involved with prostitution, but has admitted that she does not know who the father of her baby is

Miss Cunningham has a congenital medical condition which means she has no breast tissue.

She says she was bullied about her flat chest from the age of 14.

Recently she decided she wants her breast implants removed - again paid for by the NHS.
