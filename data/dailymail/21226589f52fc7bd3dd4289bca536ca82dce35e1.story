Gary Neville has criticised Manchester United’s Daley Blind for taking the ‘easy option’ and failing to provide telling passes for the team’s strikers.

The Holland international has anchored United’s midfield since his £13.8million move from Ajax in the summer.

But Blind and his new team-mates have made their worst start to a season since 1986 and are 10th after 10 games.

Daley Blind's lack of incision has drawn criticism from former Manchester United defender Gary Neville 

Blind is said to play 'too many square passes and takes the easy option' in United's midfield 

Neville, though, feels the 24-year-old must start creating more for the likes of Robin van Persie, who has scored just three times this campaign.

‘He (Blind) has got to start looking up more and playing forward,’ said Sky Sports analyst Neville.

‘He plays far too many square passes and takes the easy option.’

Meanwhile, Neville defended Van Persie.

‘Van Persie is still making his clever movement,’ he said, ‘but I don’t think his team-mates are seeing him anywhere near as much as Scholes and Carrick were two seasons ago.

‘He lives off the back of centre-backs. We called him the burglar. But Blind takes the easy option. We’re talking about the highest calibre of player here (they should be able to make passes in behind).’
