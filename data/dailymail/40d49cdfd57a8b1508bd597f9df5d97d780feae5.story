The mysterious disappearance of bubbly Disney worker Rebecca Coriam grows more puzzling as her parents reveal that they still have no idea about their daughter's last movements.

Annmaria and Mike Coriam say they continue to hold out hope that the cruise ship worker is alive after she vanished while on the Disney Wonder in March, despite being left with a raft of unanswered questions after they flew to America to try and work out what had happened to her.

The last time the tormented parents saw their daughter was at Manchester Airport in February when they waved her goodbye for what they thought would be just a few weeks of work at sea.

But the 24-year-old was reported missing on March 22 when she failed to report for a shift on the £580m cruise ship, which holds more than 3,000 
staff and passengers, after it set sail for Los Angeles on a week-long cruise to
Mexico.

Mystery: Rebecca Coriam's parents say they have not been given any conclusive answers about their popular daughter's disappearance

Rebecca's parents, who live in Guilden Sutton, Chester, have desperately sought answers about what has happened to their 'happy-go-lucky' girl, who had begun work nine months earlier as a youth activities co-ordinator, but say their efforts have been futile.

The couple flew to America to try and learn more about what had happened but claim their visit was carefully orchestrated by Disney officials.

They say that despite questioning those who worked with her, they are no closer to the truth.

They were ushered from meeting to 
meeting and deterred from speaking to the press, while precious CCTV of Rebecca's last known movements has been given to police without her parents being able to view it.

Tormented: Annmaria and Mike Coriam say they have been left without a clue as to what has happened to their daughter following her disappearance from the Disney cruise ship

The distraught couple were also 
shown onto the ship from a car with blacked-out windows and taken through a staff 
entrance while passengers disembarked.

Mrs Coriam, 52, said: 'We were shown around the 
place where Rebecca worked, through the classrooms and then we were 
taken to a tiny CCTV room which had loads of people in it.'

Rebecca was captured on CCTV making a mobile phone call to a friend shortly before she disappeared.

Mrs Coriam said: 'We saw Bex and she looked fine on the phone - there was nothing to indicate anything was wrong. We know our daughter and on the video she seemed just normal.'

Distressingly the couple were then 
taken onto the deck where the captain of the ship said he thought 
Rebecca could have been sitting shortly before her disappearance.

He claimed she was washed over the 
side by a wave. When asked about the captain's conclusions, Mr Coriam, 57, said: 
'It was very, very high up the ship, so I don't see how that could have 
happened.'

Mrs Coriam said she dismissed the possibility that her daughter, described as an athletic, fun and 
popular girl,  had taken her own life or fallen off the ship.

Missing at sea: The 24-year-old was last seen on board the cruise ship where she cared for children

She said: 'I had to climb over the 
barrier to see how someone could fall over the edge - it was near on 
impossible. You had to get under one rail, over another and climb onto a
wide ledge and even then there was a rail.

'I had to see and look for myself. I know Bex and I know that she would never have done that.'

The as-yet unseen CCTV footage from the 
deck where Rebecca is alleged to have last been seen, has been released 
to the Bahamian police. Because the Disney Wonder is registered in the Bahamas, police there are handling the investigation.

However, the Coriams believe the video 
could contain vital clues and hope to have the footage 
brought to the UK for investigation.

Since their return, the 
couple and their family and friends have gathered 
to launch a campaign to find Rebecca who 
has now been missing for six months.

Vanished: The athletic children's worker disappeared after the cruise ship set sail from Los Angeles for a week-long cruise along the Mexican Riviera but her parents say they have no idea what has become of her

Mrs Coriam said: 'You go through every scenario possible. Did she fall? Was she taken off the ship? Did something bad happen to her?

'Only when we have come back and 
started researching it did we realise that so many people go missing on 
cruise ships every year. 'We don't know if she is dead or alive. It is the not knowing.'

What was especially painful for the family was visiting their daughter's room on the ship.

Among her notes and birthday cards and a banner for her 24th birthday made by children she looked after, they discovered she had a surprise for them and her sister 
Rachel - four tickets to visit Disneyland Paris in April.

Mrs Coriam said she had spoken to her daughter only hours before she was registered as missing: 'It was quite a quick call 
but we said we would speak on Facebook on Tuesday. It was all a bit of a
rush to be honest but she seemed fine - just normal Bex. '

'And so far as we know she worked a 
normal day on Monday - she had a meal on the Monday night with all her 
friends and everything was fine.

'But we never got to speak on Tuesday (March 22).'

She said the phone call at 10.45pm 
from Disney officials, who told them their daughter was missing, left the 
couple in total shock.

Mrs Coriam said: 'We just couldn't believe it. We rang everybody, all the family and everyone just arrived. It was awful.

'We didn't hear much the following day
and it was a while before they got back to us but they said everyone 
was out searching for her.

'We just couldn't believe the ship hadn't stopped and no one had turned it around.'

Passengers on the ship have since contacted the Coriams to tell them how much they thought of  'caring and lovable' Rebecca.
