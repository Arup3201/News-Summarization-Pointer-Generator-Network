It may have been touted as the steamiest thing in Hollywood - but movie critics rounded on Fifty Shades of Grey for being too light on the sex.

In a barrage of reviews published on Tuesday night, most of those who sat down with the raunchy adaptation ahead of its 13 February release date lamented its 'run-of-the-mill' lovemaking.

One critic pointed out that sex only makes up 15 minutes of the two-hour runtime. Another pointed out that there are no visible genitals, no orgasms - and not that much nudity.

Too many clothes? Movie critics remarked on how little sex there was in the film version of Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, above, as leads Ana Steele and Christian Grey

Pants on: One writer noted that Dornan spent much of the raunchy film with only his shirt off

Frustrated critics implied that the on-screen action between leads Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan left them unfulfilled, in contrast to EL James's notoriously explicit novels.

Writing in USA Today, critic Claudia Puig said bluntly: 'Those looking for hot, kinky sex will be disappointed. Fewer than 15 of the movie's 125 minutes feature sex scenes.

'Discussion of contracts and objections over line items outweigh erotica. Even the graphic nudity grows numbing.'

In Entertainment Weekly, freelance critic Lisa Schwarzbaum particularly noted Dorman's lack of on-screen exposure.

'Nobody in the movie has visible genitals', she said. 'Christian in particular seems to do a whole lot of stuff in the playroom with his shirt off but his pants on, which cannot be comfortable for such an active young man.

'But even more frustrating to voyeurs, nobody sweats, nobody strains, nobody loses control or even fakes losing control by simulating an orgasm.'

More sweat, please: Writers seemed put out that the levels of nudity and sexual interaction on-screen did not match the steamy books by EL James

And, while the trappings and devices of kinky sex do exist in the film, another writer pointed out that they are not put to especially shocking use.

The New York Daily News's Elizabeth Weitzman said: '..anyone hoping the movie would really push the S&M envelope may find Christian's tastefully shot toy room a little… vanilla.

'We see a whip here, a handcuff there, but nothing that would shock even newcomers to the series.'

The Guardian describe Jamie Dornan's performance as 'adequate,' and reveal that the highly anticipated sex scenes only really serve to push the plot forward. 

Jordan Hoffman says: 'The sex scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey are numerous, lengthy and frank, but they aren’t smutty. 

'Only occasionally does it dip into Red Shoe Diaries-territory. By and large, these key scenes really are there to advance the plot, and only the most buttoned-up prude will be scandalised.'

'Vanilla': Though whips, handcuffs and other BDSM paraphernalia are present in the film, it was implied they are not made much use of

Disappointment? Only 15 minutes of the two-hour-plus film are said to be sex

Justin Craig from Fox News described the film as medicore: 'Just how sexually explicit is “Fifty Shades of Grey?” It’s mild. 

'Sure there’s plenty of nudity, but more salacious material is shown every day on cable. It’s not even close to late-night Cinemax. You’ll find more disturbing images in “Saw” or “Game of Thrones.”

'The mediocre plot, bland characters and tepid tone don’t do any favors. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson treats the movie as serious as a cadaver, which is truly a major disappointment.'

A writer for the Associated Press coyly noted 'there is more scintillating material in a premium HBO show'.

Lindsey Bahr said Fifty Shades was 'run of the mill' - drawing the comparison with sex-laden cable shows like Game of Thrones, or Lena Dunham's Girls, which is notoriously graphic and unsentimental when it comes to copulation.

Josh Dickey at Mashable said: 'It's just kind of an above-average and brooding "love" story, not campy or clumsy enough to be so-bad-it's-good, not quite stylish or sizzling or steamy enough to overcome its atrocious source material.' 

Starting his review of the film by echoing many of the other critics sentiments: 'Here's a criticism of Fifty Shades of Grey you probably weren't expecting: There's not nearly enough sex in it. There was supposed to be a lot more.'

Love story: Some critics have praised the romance of the film which sees Ana fall for Christian 

However, while critics mainly said the film failed to perform sexually, praise was doled out for the film's storytelling and dialogue, which was characterized as more subtle and elegant than James's novels.

Time Out New York writer David Ehrlich said: 'Substituting heartache for handcuffs, Fifty Shades is the rare studio romance in which the characters actually try to understand one another. 

'As this is the first installment of an epic trilogy, how much there is beneath the surface remains to be seen, but Taylor-Johnson seems genuinely interested in finding out. Fifty Shades may not make you come, but you’ll still be glad you went.'

Whilst Sheri Linden of the Hollywood Reporter revealed: 'It’s a slow build to the smutty bits, and one that’s disappointingly devoid of tension. 

'Even so, the movie is, by definition, a stronger proposition than the book because it strips away the oodles of cringe-inducing descriptions and internal monologue that tip the text heavily toward self-parody. 

'Things grow more compelling once Christian Grey whips out his nondisclosure agreement – along with a nice Pouilly-Fumé, naturally – and shows Ana his 'playroom', expertly outfitted with state-of-the-art S&M gear.' 

Similarly the Telegraph praised the film for stripping away the fat of the book transforming it into a sleek and watchable movie. 

Film critic Tim Robey says: 'Johnson’s timing and verve are terrific, and manage to upend the more distasteful indignities of the book in gold-spun-from-straw ways. 

'It’s her rebellion, not just her submission, that this version of Christian finds attractive, which gives Dornan something more interesting, human, and contradictory to play as well. 

'If Taylor-Johnson and James bitterly tussled for control over this material, it's a relief and even a bit of a thrill that the director came out on top.'
