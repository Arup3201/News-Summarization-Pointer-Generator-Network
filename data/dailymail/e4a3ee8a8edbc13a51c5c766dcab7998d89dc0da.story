 A luxury mansion bought for just £20,000 more than 50 years ago has gone on the market for a staggering £3MILLION.

The lavish property, near Cardiff, was bought in 1962 by late banker Sir Julian Hodge - one of Britain's wealthiest men before his death 10 years ago.

The Hodge family are now selling up - and expect to get around 150 times the amount Sir Julian first paid for it.

The mansion was bought for just £20,000 in 1962 but is now on the market for a massive £3million

The sprawling estate includes servants' quarters, a two-storey oak-panelled reception hall and access to an observatory

Estate Agents say the house offers beautiful views of the surrounding gardens and nearby Bristol Channel

Speculation is mounting in the local area about the host of celebrities rumoured to be taking tours.

Former Baywatch star David Hasselhoff, 61, and his Welsh girlfriend Hayley Roberts have been linked to neighbouring properties in the leafy village of Lisvane, near Cardiff.

And with TV's Sherlock being filmed nearby, those living in the area are hoping heart-throb Benedict Cumberbatch, 37, could become the home's new A-list owner.

Doctor Who is also being shot in the region, leading some to suggest new Doctor Peter Capaldi, 55, may stump up for the estate.

David Hasselhoff and his Welsh girlfriend Hayley Roberts could be in the running to buy the mansion, as well as Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch

Leading Cardiff estate agent David Ricketts said: 'It is a grand and imposing looking building which was once stately enough for one of Britain's biggest bankers.

'Its value in the early 1960s was round about £20,000 - it's gone up a bit since then.

'These days properties like this attract film stars and rock musicians who want to make a statement.

'Cardiff is becoming a mini Hollywood with Pinewood Studios setting up here and TV successes like Sherlock and Dr Who being filmed in South Wales.

'It will be interesting to see who moves in.

'It will certainly attract interest from outside of Wales and maybe even Europe.'

The mansion also comes with its own lodge, three-bedroomed detached house and two cottages in a converted coach house

Estates agents suggest the building could be converted into a boutique hotel or luxury health spa

Locals say the countryside around Cardiff is becoming a 'mini-Hollywood' after Pinewood set up a studios in the area

The eight-bedroomed mansion has views over its formal gardens and across to the Bristol Channel.

There is a magnificent two-storey oak-panelled reception hall with a huge leaded-light window and an imposing fireplace.

The second floor - which was the servants' quarters - has five further rooms, two bathrooms, a large storeroom and access to the mansion's own octagonal observatory built to view shipping in the channel.

Estate agents are braced for a rush of interest from foreign millionaires and celebrities

Property prices in the Cardiff area grew by nearly five per cent in the last year and the trend is set to continue

Sir Julian, best known for forming the Bank of Wales and later his own Julian Hodge Bank in Cardiff, bought the property after amassing a fortune from his businesses in the 1960s.

When he died 10 years ago at the age of 99 his estimated wealth of £48million made him the oldest of Britain's 1,000 richest people.

The property comes with its own lodge, a single-storey three-bedroomed detached house and a coach house which has been converted into two cottages.

Sir Julian bought the mansion near Cardiff 'for a song' back in 1962 and his family has owned it ever since.

Francesca Tanguy, of estate agent Cooke and Arkwright said: 'It would make a grand family home unique to Cardiff and South Wales.

'Its layout, location and grounds also make it ideal for conversion into a boutique hotel or wedding venue, or even as a destination health spa or corporate headquarters.

'We expect interest in it to come from a wide variety of sources.'
