A Montana judge who drew condemnation over his comments in a 
teacher-student rape case says he plans to retire at the end of the 
year.

District Judge Todd Baugh said on Tuesday his decision had nothing to do
 with criticism over his courtroom assertion that the 14-year-old rape 
victim appeared 'older than her chronological age'.

Baugh later apologized for that and other remarks he made in the 
case. He also sought unsuccessfully to impose a longer sentence that the
 one-month term he originally handed down.

The 72-year-old judge is the son of former Washington Redskins 
quarterback Sammy Baugh.

He says his 30 years on the bench were 
rewarding, and he looks forward to spending more time with his five 
grandchildren.

His retirement plans were first disclosed by Billings television station KTVQ.

Baugh set off a public furor in August when he said 14-year-old rape victim Cherice Morales appeared 'older than her chronological age'.Â 

Baugh
 ordered rapist Stacey Rambold to spend a month in jail because the 
teacher had 'suffered enough' and his victim was 'in control'.

Teacher Rambold admitted to raping Morales when she was a troubled high school freshman at Billings Senior High School in 2008.

She later killed herself weeks before her 17th birthday. Her mother said the attack by Rambold was 'a major factor' in her suicide.

While Baugh apologized for his comments, he maintained his sentence was appropriate.

He said in August: 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.

'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.'

Following the judge's ruling, outraged Montanans organized protests outside the courthouse in Billings.

The Montana National Organization for Women asked the state to investigate whether Rambold's sentence could be made longer.
