It is without doubt the trend that will not go away, whether it's Miley Cyrus grinning for a close-up or Kim Kardashian proudly posing for a 'belfie' with her bottom on display.

And now there's a new take on the selfie, with animals getting in on the action as a host of pet selfies sweep the internet, with pet owners encouraged to snap a shot of their furry friends to raise money for charities Angels Animal Rescue and Wood Green, The Animal Shelter.

Online retailer Buyagift is asking owners to send in a photograph of their furry 
fashionistas that look as though as their pets 
have taken the photo of themselves - just like a selfie.

Entries have already been pouring in to the competition, which will run until July 3 - with more than 700 entries already submitted, including a dog nailing two trends in a dinosaur onesie, to a tabby cat reaching out as if he is trying to find his best angle.

'It’s fair to say that the individual selfie has taken the web by storm in recent months - and it’s not just celebs who are getting in on the act,' said a Buyagift spokesman.

'But, why shouldn’t our pets get involved, too? We wanted to see just how popular pet selfies could be – and whether they could potentially become as big as the original selfie – and we have to say that it’s looking that way.'
