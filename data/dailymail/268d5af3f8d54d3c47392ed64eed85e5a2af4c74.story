Parents at Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster have claimed they were asked for a payment of £96 when joining year seven

The top state secondary school chosen by David Cameron for his daughter could face an official probe after claims it asked parents to pay a £120 donation when offering places.

A form sent to teenagers given a sought-after place at Grey Coat Hospital School's sixth form asks them to say whether they accept the offer and then return the slip, along with a cheque  for the 'School Fund'.

Parents at Grey Coat have also claimed they were asked for a payment of £96 when joining year seven.

The request may breach school admission rules, which say state schools cannot request any type of financial contribution as part of the admission process.

The situation may now be examined by the Office of the Schools Adjudicator. As Grey Coat Hospital School is an academy, the Education Funding Agency could also investigate the issue. 

The school has refused to comment over the allegations.

Earlier this week, the Prime Minister spoke of his relief after learning that his daughter Nancy had secured a place at popular Westminster school.

Mr Cameron said it was 'a weight off everybody's mind', adding: 'It's nerve-wracking enough watching your eldest go from junior to secondary school,' he said.

'Nancy has just found out she's got a place at good state secondary school in London. She's happy - because her best friend is going there. Sam and I are happy - because we know she'll be looked after and get a great education there.'

The daughter of former education secretary Michael Gove also attends the popular Grey Coat Hospital School.

It is understood that Mr Gove was not asked - and did not pay - any donation when his daughter was offered a place at the school. 

David and Samantha Cameron learned their daughter Nancy had won a place at the sought after Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster last week

The £120 donation to the 'School Fund' allows teachers to run extra-curricular activities for students, according to a leaked document seen by  trade magazine School Week.

It is 'an important way' of showing that a student is serious about attending the school, patents are told.

The first document seen by Schools Week asks teenagers to complete a form say whether they intend to take up a place in the sixth-form, and includes the line 'I enclose a cheque for £120 for School Fund'. It asks for signatures from both pupils and parent.

The second document says: 'If you confirm your offer of a place at Grey Coat for September 2015, then we ask you to pay School Fund, which for sixth form students is set at £120 per annum.

'School Fund enables to school to provide many of the extra-curricular activities that are run for Year 12 throughout the academic year, in particular the team-building activities/resources which are provided during induction week.'

It goes on to say: 'As school budgets are squeezed, school fund contributions will, from now on, also help toward improving the learning environment across the school.'

The letter says that if families are able to provide a cheque for the full amount then they should make it payable to the school and return it with the confirmation slip. Anyone with queries should contact a named person at the school.

It adds: 'Paying School Fund is an important way of showing us that you are serious about taking up a place with us in Year 12 in September.'

The latest admissions code for state schools in England says that admissions authorities must not 'request financial contributions (either in the form of voluntary contributions, donations or deposits (even if refundable)) as any part of the admissions process'.

A DfE spokesperson: 'Any claim that the School Admissions Code has been breached will be investigated.'
