Letters containing the conclusions of the Chilcot Inquiry have been sent to the main participants, including Tony Blair, the Daily Mail understands

Letters containing the detailed conclusions of the public inquiry into the Iraq War have been sent to the main participants, the Daily Mail understands.

The revelation will increase speculation that the conclusions of the long-delayed inquiry could be made public in the coming months.

Tony Blair and Jack Straw are among those thought to have received letters in recent weeks warning them of any criticisms to be made by Sir John Chilcot.

Whitehall sources have told the Mail the letters were sent out ‘some time ago’.

In May David Cameron said he expected the report to be published ‘before the end of the year’.

He added: ‘The public wants to see the answers of the inquiry and I think we shouldn’t have to wait too much longer.’

But just four weeks of the Parliamentary term remain – making it unlikely that it will be published before MPs recess for Christmas.

By law, anyone who will face criticism of a public inquiry must be sent a letter warning them of the contents.

They are then permitted to challenge any negative findings.

These so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ letters are the result of a court challenge by Robert Maxwell who overturned the verdict of a critical report in 1969.

Legal wrangling between participants who want to challenge any personal criticisms contained in the report could cause further delay.

Senior Labour figures will fear the publication of the inquiry’s conclusions in the run up to the election, knowing it will remind the public of the divisive conflict and re-open old wounds within the party.

First launched by Gordon Brown in July 2009, the Chilcot inquiry began its hearings in November that year and finished taking formal evidence in 2011.

But lengthy delays were caused by arguments between Sir John Chilcot, the inquiry’s chairman and the US and British governments over the publication of correspondence between Mr Blair and President George W Bush.

Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his long-awaited report would publish only ‘the gist’ and some quotes of Mr Blair’s messages to Mr Bush. The US president’s replies will not be published in any form.

Sir John said this was vital in order for people to understand the inquiry’s conclusions. Families of servicemen killed in the Iraq conflict condemned the decision not to publish the documents in full.

The report has been hit with delays because of arguments over whether correspondence between Blair and President George Bush should be included in full

They said it meant they might never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war.

Earlier this year Mr Blair insisted he was not the reason for the delay in publishing the report. The former prime minister said he resented suggestions that he was holding it up.

He said the ‘sooner it is published the better’.

‘I have got as much interest as anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position,’ Mr Blair said.

Figures released in recent weeks show the cost of the inquiry is set to top £11million. Senior figures, including Mr Blair, are expected to have their legal bills for the inquiry paid by the taxpayer.

Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, a critic of the war, said the report should be published ‘as soon as possible’.

‘This has gone on long enough. People have a right to know when they vote in May about the roles of those involved in taking Britain to war.’

‘People may argue it is political to publish it before May, but I would argue it would be political not to do so.’

A spokesman for the Chilcot inquiry declined to comment.

A spokesman for Mr Blair’s office said: ‘No comment’.

Mr Straw could not be reached for comment.
