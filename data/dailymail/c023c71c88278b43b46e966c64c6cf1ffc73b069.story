The NHS is rationing operations and treatment for patients deemed too fat.

An investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese.

These include hip and knee surgery, IVF, joint replacements and in the case of one organisation, all routine operations.

Details obtained from Freedom of Information requests also show that two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers.

Senior doctors have described the policies as ‘blatant rationing’ and say they are ‘immoral’ and ‘unfair’.

But managers said that given their increasingly limited budgets, it was inappropriate to offer certain non-urgent treatments to patients for which they might not be effective.

The NHS as a whole is under severe financial strain and is struggling to meet the demands of the rising and increasingly ageing population.

Last year its Chief Executive Simon Stevens predicted that an extra £30 billion would need to go into its budget by 2020 just to ensure the standards of care did not slip.

In the face of such financial pressure, many trusts have begun rationing procedures which aren’t deemed urgent to save money.

But this investigation by GP magazine  reveals the extent to which managers are refusing patients treatment due to their lifestyles.

Freedom of Information responses from 145 of the 211 Clinical Commissioning Groups, (CCGS), – local NHS bodies – showed that 38 per cent restricted some procedures for obese patients.

A further 63 per cent refused to allow patients to have certain treatment if they smoked.

Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, who is based in Leeds, said managers were using ‘spurious clinical reasons’ to discriminate some patients.

He added: ‘It’s blatant rationing. CCGs should be open and honest.

‘If we’re going to ration a service we should ration it for all people, not just those in particular groups and pretend it’s for clinical reasons.

‘If it’s purely down to cost saving, it’s not ethical.

‘There are clearly cases where certain people’s body size may make it difficult to safely do a certain procedure, but they’re exceptional.

‘I think what’s happening here is overt rationing to save money.’

Katherine Murphy, Chief Executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘We are aware that hospital trusts are under considerable financial pressures, but we hope that the need to save money won’t affect patient safety.

‘Each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient.

‘We recognise that patients do have a responsibility to look after their own health and to be aware of the outcomes of unhealthy lifestyles.

‘However, patients should not take the brunt for years of wasteful spending in the NHS.

‘It is easy to target vulnerable patients, and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who aren’t always able to speak out.’

Herts Valleys CCG in Hertfordshire refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is above 35.

This is a measurement of obesity and above 25 is classified as overweight, over 30 obese and more than 35, morbidly obese.

And a total of 30 CCGs refused to pay for IVF for women with a BMI of over 30.

The figures reveal that Herts Valleys CCG in Hertfordshire refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is above 35

This is equivalent to a 5ft 6 woman (170 m) weighing just under 13 and a half stone (84 kg).

Dr David Haslam, GP in Watton-in-Stone, Hertfordshire, who is also chair of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘What we hate as GPs is blanket bans and you can’t just take BMI (a measure of obesity) as a reason to operate or not operate.

‘Some restrictions could have a sound clinical basis, he said, but it is wrong to turn away patients based on weight and do nothing to help change their circumstances.

‘Weight loss interventions must be offered, otherwise it’s immoral and unethical,’ he said.

Several of the CCGs said that IVF and joint replacements, for example, weren’t always successful for the obese patients and therefore not ‘cost effective.’

Last year managers at Northern, Eastern and Western Devon CCG threatened to ban all treatments for anyone with a BMI above 35 to help cut a £14.5 million shortfall in its budget.

They subsequently dropped the proposals following an outcry from patient groups and health professionals, including the Royal College of Surgeons.
