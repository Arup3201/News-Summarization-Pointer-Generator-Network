While the traditional view of student housing is a scene of squalor, these luxury new apartments are set to take the cost of a degree to £100,000.

Those soon to start studying at Exeter University who want to live in one of these properties will be looking at a rental price of £1,000 a month.

The development of the city’s old library and records office into 44 luxury flats for undergraduates will be ready in time for the next intake of students.

The flats come equipped with modern appliances including 100MB broadband, 24-hour helpdesk services, Wi-Fi and flat-screen smart TV.

The development features one and two-bedroom apartments – with most offering tall, light-filled living spaces overlooked by mezzanine bedrooms.

And the top floor has student lofts which will reportedly benefit from far-reaching views over the city - and even the Devon countryside.

Rents range from £150 to £220 per person per week, with all bills and contents insurance covered within this price.

UK students would therefore be paying up to £11,220 a year, on top of the £9,000-a-year course fees, totally almost £61,000 over three years.

For international students, thanks to their fees of up to £17,500-a-year, the total figure could be more than £85,000 - before living costs are factored in.

The university website says term-time living costs - excluding accommodation - are £3,740 a year, making the total cost of a degree near £100,000.

The building is being renovated by developer Burrington Estates, which has already converted another site in the city into luxury student apartments.

Co-founder Mark Edworthy said: ‘Following the huge popularity of Dean Clarke Lofts, we expect a high level of interest in these unique apartments.'

He added: ‘We are excited to be bringing a fresh new vibe to this historic building.’

A survey last month found students in Loughborough are spending a third more for their home than non-students living in similar housing in the town. 

But Reading was the cheapest city with students paying an average of £80.78 per person per week in areas with an overall average price of £132.75.

Students now pay £202.40 on average in London, but this is much better than non-students who have to spend £299.40 to live in the same areas.
