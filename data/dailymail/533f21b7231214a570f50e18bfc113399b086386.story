Ruby the Heart-stealer, the underage erotic dancer who was paid by Silvio Berlusconi for sex, has said that she wishes she could ‘go back to being a girl who sold carpets on the beach’.

The former Italian premier was sentenced to seven years in jail for paying for sex with Ruby, now 22, when she was just 17.

In Italy, it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18.  

Ruby the Heart-stealer, the underage erotic dancer who was paid by Silvio Berlusconi for sex, has said that she wishes she could 'go back to being a girl who sold carpets on the beach'

As lawyers for the billionaire politician began the first legal appeal against the guilty sentence in a Milan courtroom, Ruby gave an interview in which she apparently claimed that Berlusconi was the best man she had ever met.

Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug, told the newspaper Il Giornale, which is run by Berlusconi’s brother Paolo: ‘The truth is, Berlusconi treated me with more respect than all the other men I had met before at pubs and clubs.

'He got seven years for nothing.'

The former nightclub dancer claimed that her life had been ruined, not by the media mogul, but by those who were using her to bring down the former prime minister.

She said she found it difficult to keep a job as people assumed she had plenty of money.

Ruby added: 'I'm tired. I am in a war-making machine where people don't care about the truth - they just want to follow an objective.

She claimed that when she told friends she had slept with the then prime minister, she was ‘making up crap to give myself airs'.

She said: ‘I was 17, I was a total mess, I invented nonsense. It was the mistakes of youth… Do I have to pay for it forever? ‘

It has been widely reported that Berlusconi has given her millions to keep quiet.

But Ruby claimed: ‘If I had five million [euros], I wouldn’t have to ask my in-laws for money to do the shopping.’

The flamboyant politician was not in court but was taking part in community service for a separate conviction for tax evasion.
