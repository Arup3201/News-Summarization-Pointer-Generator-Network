One man has died and another is in a critical condition after a high-speed boat crash during a memorial Bridge to Bridge time-trials.

It is the second fatality in two years for the prestigious race.

44-year-old experienced observer Ian Baker, nicknamed Bakes, from Victoria, died when he was thrown from his boat on the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney.

Police were called to the crash scene following reports a boat had flipped over during time trials for Sunday's race, throwing its occupants into the water.

The cause of the crash has not been confirmed, however investigations are underway.

The driver, Daniel McMahon, from Perth, is in a serious condition in Westmead Hospital.

The high-speed race trials were being held in remembrance of 20-year-old champion water-skier Sarah Teelow, who sustained serious spinal and head injuries and died in the same race, just one year ago.

Inspector Suzanne Rode-Sander said the boat had apparently flipped over during its designated time trial.

She said the skiers were obviously very distressed following the incident.

‘It’s very tragic and it’s very upsetting for all concerned,’ she said.

Noel Griffin from Ski Racing Australia expressed his sadness at today's tragedy in a statement.

'Police and maritime authorities have taken charge of the incident and it is not appropriate that we make further direct comment until those authorities have informed relatives and given us permission to speak,' he said.

'The one thing I’d like to see is Superclass and Unlimited becoming capped for speed. It would make all boats equal, and probably more importantly, it would be safer.' he said.

He also talked about the teams drive and their love for the sport.

'At first, we had some resistance within the sport – not many people had that sort of mindset, and a lot of them would tell us that’s just not the way th
