Robin van Persie will come face to face with the referee he once labelled as 'unknown' in Holland’s semi-final clash with Argentina.

Turkish official Cuneyt Cakir will take charge of the game in Sao Paulo and Dutch striker Van Persie has criticised the referee in the past.

Cakir sent off Van Persie’s Manchester United team-mate Nani in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in 2013 and the Dutchman was far from impressed with the decision.

The Turkish referee showed Nani a straight red card for a high footed challenge on Alvaro Arbeloa and after the game Van Persie said: 'I didn’t understand before the match that this man would be the referee, an unknown referee who hasn’t been in charge of a big game for months.'

Argentina duo Angel Di Maria – who will miss the semi-final through injury - and Gonzalo Higuain played for Real Madrid that night at Old Trafford.

Cakir has taken charge of two games at the tournament so far, Brazil’s goalless Group A game with Mexico and Algeria’s 1-1 draw with Russia. In those games he has shown nine yellow cards but has not sent anyone off.
