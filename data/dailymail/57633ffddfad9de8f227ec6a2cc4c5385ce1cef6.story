Norway starlet Martin Odegaard enjoyed a training session with Liverpool's first-team on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers continues to plot a move for the talented 15-year-old.

The Stromsgodset midfielder, who has already spent time with Real Madrid and Manchester United - although United hope to see him again - landed on Merseyside to take a look at Liverpool's ground and facilities on Wednesday.

But his trip turned into a trial of sorts when he was given the opportunity to impress Rodgers and his potential team-mates during the session at Melwood.

Stromsgodset starlet Martin Odegaard enjoyed a training session with Liverpool's first-team on Thursday

The 15-year-old was the youngest player to feature in a Euro qualifier after making his debut against Bulgaria

Age: 15 (D.O.B. 17/12/98)

Born: Drammen, Norway

Position: Attacking midfielder

Club: Stromsgodset (2014-)

Appearances: 24

Goals: 5

International appearances: 3

International goals: 0 

Liverpool's first team squad and staff were given the day off on Wednesday but midfielder Odegaard, supposedly a fan of the Anfield club, and his father took the opportunity to look around the stadium, Melwood and Liverpool city centre. 

After the training session, Reds defender Kolo Toure told Norway's TV2 how impressed he was with the youngster.

He said: 'I met him (Odegaard) today and he is a very good player.

'He was good in training.'

And when he was asked whether he wanted the Norwegian to join him at Anfield, he laughed and said: 'I don't know.' 

Odegaard already has three international caps after becoming the youngest player ever to play in a European Championship qualifier when he made his debut for Norway against Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days.

He turns 16 on December 17.

Most of Europe's top sides have made approaches to Stromsgodset although Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has ruled his side out of the race.

Mourinho said: 'I have heard from him and he can go to 25 clubs. I want to know what club it is going to be, but we will not go into battle with all these clubs.'
