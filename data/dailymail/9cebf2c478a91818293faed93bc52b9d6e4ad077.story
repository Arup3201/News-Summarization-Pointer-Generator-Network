Nearly two thirds of patients seeking treatment for depression are women, NHS figures show.

Almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or behavioural therapy last year, compared to only 274,000 men.

The figures, which for the first time reveal the numbers of patients receiving the so-called ‘talking treatments’, also showed women under 50, and especially those in their 20s, are most likely to seek help.

Some experts say women are more prone to mental illness because they tend to bottle up their emotions, whereas men lash out if angry.

But female patients are also far more likely to admit they have a problem.

Only last month, the NHS’s annual health survey revealed that almost a quarter of women were depressed or very anxious.

According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre’s  figures, 761,848 patients were referred last year for counselling, psychological treatment or behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety.

Some 62 per cent were women, though in some cases the gender was not recorded.

Three quarters were aged 20 to 49, with the majority of those cases – 185,700 – in their 20s.

Because this is the first time the data has been published, it is impossible to know whether the numbers needing treatment for depression is on the rise.

However, separate NHS figures show there has been a surge in prescriptions for antidepressants with 50million handed out a year, a rise of 7.5 per cent compared to the year before.

The increase has partly been blamed on financial woes although there is also concern that patients are becoming addicted to the drugs, with GPs writing out repeat prescriptions too easily.

Expert: Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity SANE, said: women 'feel more able to express their feelings and look for support'

Experts are divided over whether women are more susceptible to depression and anxiety or whether they are better at seeking professional help.

Beth Murphy, of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘While there is no gender difference in the prevalence of mental health problems, women are much more likely to seek help than men, and are more willing to talk about their own mental wellbeing. All the signs suggest that more and more people are seeking help for mental health problems.

‘Prescriptions for antidepressants have been rising steadily and recently topped 50million for the first time, while the numbers of people contacting organisations like Mind for help are also increasing.

‘We also know that people are really struggling at the moment, as unemployment, cuts to welfare and other pressures take their toll on the mental health of the nation.

‘It’s important that anyone struggling with their mental health speaks to their GP as soon as possible.’

Last month the NHS’s annual health survey involving 8,000 adults showed 23 per cent of women reported feeling anxious or had been diagnosed with depression.

Some experts argue that this is because women tend to want to share their feelings when they are at their lowest ebb, while men are more likely to turn to alcohol or physical violence.

Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity SANE, said: ‘Previous research indicates that depression is around twice as common among women as men, as is self-harm and suicide attempts. But it is young and middle-aged men who are most at risk of actually taking their own lives.

‘The reasons may be in part because women feel more able to express their feelings and look for support.’
