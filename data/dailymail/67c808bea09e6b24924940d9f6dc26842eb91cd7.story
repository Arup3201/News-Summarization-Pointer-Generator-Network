Toyota has been forced to recall 885,000 cars to fix a problem which could see drivers' airbags activated at random.

One of the models which needs repair is the Camry, which is the best selling car in the United States, having already sold 318,990 cars so far this year.

The fault is caused by a water leak in the air conditioning unit which could cause water to seep into other parts of the car causing circuits to short and unexpected malfunctions to occur.

Toyota said that the airbag control module is one area which could be affected with the safety device becoming 'disabled or could inadvertently deploy'.

In a few cases the power steering function could be disabled, they said.

As well as Camrys made in the last two years, any models of the Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza which were made in 2012 and 2013 are also being recalled.

Of the massive number which need fixing, 847,000 are in North America with the in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

According to Toyota, they have received news of two minor injuries being caused by the faults, but there have been no crashes due to the error as yet.

Sporty: More than 50,000 versions of the Toyota Avalon have been sold in the USA this year. Those which were made in 2012/13 have been recalled

Problematic: The auto manufacturer has recalled Camrys, Venzas (pictured) and Avalons, as well as their hybrid counterparts, in the U.S. that were built from 2012 onwards

The Japanese car company have already issued two major recalls in recent months, asking for the return of around around 2.2 million vehicles.

In September, the company called back around 780,000 Lexus and Rav4 models.

That was a second recall of the same models after an initial call back in 2012 did not fix problems with the cars suspension systems.

Last month, they also recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US after a problem with the gear box was discovered.

Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers.

A statement on the car maker's American site, said: 'Owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail to return their vehicles to a Toyota dealer for the repair.'
