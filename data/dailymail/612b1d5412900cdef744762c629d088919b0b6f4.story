Australia has extended its search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 to include parts of the Indian Ocean.

Malaysia's Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein says Australia is among more than 15 countries considered to be possible locations for MH370, which has been missing since March 8, The Age reports.

Other countries in the search include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and France.

It could be anywhere: Malaysian authorities have called on Australia to broaden its search in the Indian Ocean

Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General David Hurley, has re-deployed two planes in the search for MH370

'Malaysian officials are requesting assistance from these countries,' Mr Hishammuddin said.

'Officials are also asking countries to provide further assistance in the search for the aircraft including satellite data and analysis, ground search capabilities, radar data and maritime and air assets.'

The Boeing 777 was last picked up on satellite at 8.11am on March 8. Authorities are considering hijacking and piracy as possible reasons behind the plane's disappearance.

Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General David Hurley, confirmed Australia had been asked to help broaden the search area off the country's north-west coast.

'One RAAF AP-3C Orion commenced searching the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands,' he said last night.

'This aircraft is expected to recover to the Cocos Islands overnight and launch from that location on Monday to maximise mission time in the expanded search area.'

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed on Monday afternoon that Australia would lead the extensive Indian Ocean search, after speaking with Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak.'I agreed that we would do so,' Mr Abbott told Parliament.'I offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted.'I wish to assure the House and the Australian people that Australia will do its duty in this matter.'

The search for MH370 has taken a number of unexpected turns after what began as a small and contained operation.After initially covering an area of 50 nautical miles from the plane's last-known position, the search expanded to include the Gulf of Thailand.Within days the search area had blown out to 27,000 nautical miles. Now it extends far and wide, including an area of the Indian Ocean that stretches halfway to Africa.A source in Kuala Lumpur has revealed the plane's fuel reserves were nearly empty when it was last detected on satellite - seven hours and 31 minutes after it took off.'It must have been almost flying on fumes,' the source was quoted as saying in The Age.
