Black Widow: Melissa Ann Shepard, pictured, confessed to drugging her latest husband

A Canadian woman dubbed the 'Black Widow' for her track record of persuading grieving widowers to marry her pleaded guilty on Monday to spiking her latest husband's coffee on their honeymoon.

Melissa Ann Shepard, 78, was charged last October after Fred Weeks, 75, fell ill at a bed and breakfast in Nova Scotia four days after they were married.

She pleaded guilty to administering a noxious substance and failing to provide the necessities of life but an attempted murder charge was dropped because the prosecution couldn't prove the woman intended to kill Weeks.

She confessed to mixing tranquilizers 
Lorazepam and Temazepam into Weeks' drinks while they were aboard a 
ferry from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia on their way to Port-aux-Basques, 
Newfoundland for their honeymoon.

Shepard married Weeks in a civil ceremony at his home in a New Glasgow seniors' complex on September 25, 2012, a few weeks after they met. She reportedly moved into the same complex in August and introduced herself, saying she was lonely.

The day after their wedding, on September 26, they set off on vacation.

A ferry employee told investigators that when Weeks came aboard the ferry bound for Newfoundland, he was spry enough to easily walk 200 meters from his car to an elevator and was cracking jokes when he and Shepard were escorted to their cabin.

But Weeks was 'a totally different person' the next day, the employee said, adding that heÂ  was unable to walk, couldn't put on his sneakers, didn't know where his car keys were and required the use of a wheelchair.

The couple briefly stayed in a 
Newfoundland hotel but checked out that same day before returning to 
North Sydney, where they stayed at a bed and breakfast.

It
was there he fell out of bed and was hospitalized, the statement said. 
At the hospital, Shepard misinformed nurses and doctors about his 
health, saying he had prostate problems, bowel surgery and was suffering
from dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, the court 
heard. She also told hospital officials that Weeks, a father of six 
adult children, had no other family.

Police found Shepard in possession of
several prescription medications including lorazepam and temazepam 
along with several pieces of identification which listed other last 
names used by the woman, including Friedrich and Russell.

Shepard became known as the 'Black 
Widow' because of her prior convictions stemming from her past 
relationships. She was convicted of manslaughter in 1992 in the death of
her second husband, Gordon Stewart, who she drugged and run over twice 
with a car.

Theft: Alex Strategos, pictured right with Shepard, said she stole $20,000 from him over the month that they lived together in 2005

In 2005, 
Shepard -- who has gone by several other surnames -- was sentenced to 
five years in prison on seven counts of theft from a man in Florida who 
she had met online. Alex Strategos, now 81, said she stole $20,000 from 
him over the month that they lived together.

She faces a maximum 
sentence of two years for the charge of administering a noxious thing 
and 18 months for failing to provide the necessities of life.

Her marriage to Weeks has now been declared invalid by the province's Vital Statistics Division after it said false information was provided on the marriage certificate.

Weeks was in the courtroom on Monday but didn't comment.
