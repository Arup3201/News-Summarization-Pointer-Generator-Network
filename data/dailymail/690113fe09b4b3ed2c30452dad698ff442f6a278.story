Police in West Texas say they have solved the murder of a highly-decorated U.S. Army officer in a case that has remained cold for 36 years.

On Thursday investigators arrested the estranged wife and stepson of Major Chester Garrett, who was found dead in the back of his Volkswagen Beetle in 1977.

Officials have charged Lisbeth Garrett, 74, and Roger Garrett, 54, with killing the military hero, who was 36 when he died.

Police say the case was reopened after new information was received in 2006, leads that led to these arrests.

Special Forces hero: Major Chester Garrett was commended for his bravery in the Vietnam War before being found dead in his car in 1977. 36 years later his wife and stepson have been charged with his murder

Major Garrett's bloody body was found in the back seat of his 1972 Volkswagen by a passing motorist in the desert east of El Paso in January 1977.

Investigators say he'd been stabbed 10 times but died of a skull fracture.

Local police discovered footprints and vehicle tracks near the car but authorities weren't able to pursue any leads and the case went gradually cold.

Garrett was in the U.S Army Special Forces, served four tours in Vietnam and was commended for 'extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty' for his actions during the Vietnam War.

'From what we've learned, the man was real tough - a Special Forces type, almost what you'd call a superman,' a sheriff told reporters in 1977, as reported by the El Paso Times.

'Whoever got him must have been mighty tough, too, and probably more than one, and probably took him by surprise.'

Major Garrett was executive officer of the student battalion at the Fort Bliss Air Defense School in Texas when he died in 1977

Garrett was executive officer of the student battalion at the Fort Bliss Air Defense School, as well as a basketball and baseball coach, at the time he died.

The murder case was reinvestigated in 2006 when family members contacted the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office with new leads, including a co-case that also took place in 1977.

Using this fresh evidence police tracked down Major Garrett's stepson to Knoxville, Tennessee. Roger Garrett had been living there for a couple of months and had recently lost his job.

Knoxville Police spokesperson, Darrell DeBusk, told WATE that Garrett had no idea that investigators were ringing about a homicide 36 years ago.

'He thought we were calling about another issue and he made the suggestion for him to come by. When he did we placed him into custody,' DeBusk said.

At the same time, police arrested Major Garrett's widow, Lizbeth Ann Garrett, in El Paso.

Officials have not cited a possible motive for the killing but both the stepson and the wife of the murdered man have been placed on bonds of $5 million.  

'We've been working this case for many years,' sheriff's Cmdr. Paul Cross told the El Paso Times.

'The homicide guys did a tremendous job never quitting that case. It's a great night, and hopefully this is the first step in getting justice for him and his family.'
