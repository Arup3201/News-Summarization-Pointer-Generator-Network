Hope Solo married her footballer fiancé on Tuesday, hours after he appeared in court accused of striking her in a domestic dispute during a late-night party at their home, it has been claimed.

The soccer star's wedding to Jerramy Stevens was believed to have taken place after Solo's soccer teammate Jillian Loyden, who arrived in the couple's hometown of Seattle on November 11, made an announcement on Twitter.

Loyden, who won gold alongside Solo at this summer's Olympic Games, tweeted: 'Happy to witness such an amazing celebration of real love.'

Moving fast: Hope Solo has reportedly married her fiancé Jerramy Stevens after dating for two months

The pair had applied for a marriage license last Thursday and have been together for two months.

Former Seahawks tight end Jerramy 
Stevens, 33, was arrested at 3.45am on Monday for the fourth-degree 
assault of Hope, 31, after an altercation involving a number of people 
which left the controversial soccer star nursing a cut elbow.

According
to the police report, Stevens was taken into custody after officers 
were called by Solo's older brother Marcus, who had used a 'stun gun' to
fight off a group of men who were not invited to a party at the house.

After appearing in front of the Kirkland Municipal Court judge today, Stevens, who has a long list of run-ins with the police, was released after no evidence was produced connecting Stevens to any assault during the fracas.

Also in court to witness her fiancé 
was U.S. women's soccer team goalkeeper Hope Solo, who had allegedly 
already been uncooperative with King County Police regarding the 
incident and declined to give comment after the legal proceedings.

A
call to a number listed for Stevens in court documents rang unanswered.
A message left at a listed number for Solo was not immediately 
returned.

The two, who have been in a relationship for two months, were set to get
married on Tuesday and argued over whether to live in Washington or 
Florida, according to court documents.

Police in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland responded to a disturbance at a
home around 3.45 a.m. Monday involving a physical altercation between 
eight people during a party, said Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray.

He
said officers contacted several people in the home who appeared 
intoxicated and didn't cooperate with police, but determined based on 
information and observations that there was probable cause to arrest 
Stevens for investigation of fourth-degree assault. Murray didn't 
identify the alleged victim, but court records show it was Solo, who 
received a cut to her elbow.

Court documents show that Solo's 
36-year-old brother, Marcus, called 911, and that he and Solo told 
officers there was a party and blamed the disturbance on two to three 
unknown men who were at the party. Marcus Solo told police he used a 
stun gun on one of the men, who left the party before police arrived, 
according to court records.

According to court documents, a police officer found Stevens, 'who 
appeared to be hiding,' lying between the bed and the wall in an 
upstairs bedroom. Stevens told officers he was sleeping on the floor and
didn't hear the fight. The officer saw signs of a fight, and dried 
blood on Stevens' shirt.

The officer noted in his affidavit for 
probable cause for arrest that he arrested Stevens based on his 
admission that he argued with Hope Solo, the injury to her elbow, signs 
of a fight in the bedroom where Stevens was found and blood on Stevens' 
shirt.

One 32-year-old woman was taken to the hospital for 
treatment of a hip injury, and another man suffered multiple bumps, 
scrapes and contusions, Murray said.

'If officers find that an 
assault may have taken place, then we have to make an arrest on who we 
determine is the primary aggressor,' Murray said.

He was mostly a first-round bust with the Seahawks, except for the 2005 season when he started a career-high 12 games and had 45 receptions as the Seahawks won the NFC championship.

His run-ins with the law weren't done when he left college. Stevens was arrested on reckless driving charges in 2003 in a Seattle suburb and in 2007 when he was charged with driving under the influence in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Stevens' most recent arrest came in 2010, while he was playing for Tampa Bay, when he was arrested the night before a game for possession of marijuana. He was almost immediately released by the team.

Controversial soccer star Hope Solo has a history of high profile run-ins with authority and even with her own team-mates.

In August, extracts from her latest autobiography book revealed the frustration she felt after the clique of older players within the U.S. women's soccer team suspended her for comments she made after being benched in favor of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry in 2007.

The outspoken two-time Olympic champion's book, 'Solo: A Memoir of Hope', gives the 31-year-old's version of events after she described the decision to replace her for the United States' 4-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil 'the wrong decision'.

Detailing a dramatic and aggressive confrontation with the heroes of the 1999 World Cup winning U.S. team following her comments, Solo, who was 26 at the time reveals she was made to publicly apologize twice before her teammates took the decision to kick her off the team during the tournament in China.

Originally in the starting 11 for the 2007 World Cup, Solo was relegated to the bench after a series of poor performances during the United States' run to the semi-final match against the Brazilians.

Replaced by Briana Scurry, then 36-years-old, who had acted as Solo's mentor during her time in the soccer set-up, the flamboyant goalkeeper spoke to the media after the defeat to explain why coach Greg Ryan had made 'the wrong decision.'

In the hours following her comments, Solo claims that she did not for-see any problems with what she had said.

However, upon arrival to their hotel in Shanghai, Solo was summoned to the hotel room of team captain Kristine Lilly, who was waiting for her with other so-called veterans of the 1999 World Cup victory.

'It was our team captain Kristine Lilly. She said the veterans wanted to talk to me and asked if I would come to their room,' explained Solo in her memoir.

'I walked down the hall. By now it was after midnight. I pushed open the door of Lil's room and saw the veterans grimly waiting for me. Kate Markgraf stood by the door. Lil, Shannon Boxx, Christie Pearce Rampone, Abby, and Bri sat on the beds.

'I walked across to the other side of the room and leaned against the wall.

'They had seen the interview. I was told that I had, in their opinion, basically committed treason.'Describing the expletive filled lecture she received from the older players, Solo revealed that experienced defender Kate Markgraf walked out on the meeting saying 'I can't even f***ing look at you.'

Solo reveals in her book that she found this to be 'overly dramatic.'

'They told me that you don't throw a teammate under the bus, that I had broken the code, that I had betrayed the team,' said Solo.

Fun! Hope Solo, the gold-medal wining women's 
soccer player, lifted the lid on the rumoured raging parties and 
sexual exploits of the world's most respected athletes in ESPN's annual 
Body Issue. She's pictured in the magazine in 2011

Secret: She also said that that right after winning the Olympic gold in 2008, she sneaked a celebrity to her room

And in this summer's edition of ESPN Magazines now annual 'Bodies' edition, the flamboyant soccer star lifted the lid on the sexual antics of Olympic athletes.

Solo detailed her and her competitors
adventures off the field and in the Olympic Village, saying the entire 
women's soccer team was completely wasted when they appeared on the 
Today show in 2008 after winning the gold medal.

'I've
seen people having sex right out in the open. On the grass, between 
buildings, people are getting down and dirty,' she explained to the popular sports publication.

After taking home the 2008 gold medal
in Beijing for women's soccer, Ms Solo and her teammates made a brief 
appearance on the Today show.

The
women smiled and spoke succinctly, but Ms Solo revealed that their 
demeanor was more linked to the fact that there were drunk from the 
night before.

'When we were done partying, we got 
out of our nice dresses, got back into our stadium coats and, at 7 a.m.,
with no sleep, went on the Today Show drunk,' she told ESPN.

'Needless to say, we looked like hell!'

The
most memorable part of the interview is when a clearly exhausted Ms 
Solo calls the Olympics the World Cup, before quickly correcting 
herself.

She also said that that right after the game she sneaked a celebrity into her room.

Refusing
to identify the lucky fellow, she did admit that she and her teammates 
had partied it up with actor Vince Vaughn earlier in the night.
