Defense attorneys for a Las Vegas man charged in a 2012 machete attack on his ex-girlfriend that split her scalp and severed her hands at the wrists claim he was too inebriated to remember or know what he did.

Trial began Tuesday for Armando Vergara-Martinez in the March 2012 armed assault on 53-year-old Maria Del Carmen Gomez in a North Las Vegas convenience store parking lot.

Vergara-Martinez's public defender, Tegan Machnich, said her client is conceding guilt on mayhem and domestic battery with a weapon causing substantial bodily harm charges.

Defendant: Armando Vergara-Martinez appears in court during his trial at the Clark County Regional Justice Center, Tuesday in Las Vegas, accused of attacking his ex-girlfriend with a machete

Savage crime: Maria Del Carmen Gomez, 53, had both her hands lopped off at the wrist and her scalp split with a machete in March 2012

Tragic end: Six months after Miss Gomez (right) survived a surgery to reattach her hands following Vergara-Martinez's (left) attack, the woman died from uterine cancer 

Those charges could get Vergara-Martinez up to 25 years in state prison. The defendant, however, has pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder count.

Gomez's hands were surgically reattached, but she died almost six months later from unrelated uterine cancer.

On the first day of the trial, the jury was shown graphic images from the machete attack and heard grisly details about the physical damage sustained by the victim.

Addressing the jurors, prosecutor 
Elana Lee Graham said that Vergara-Martinez was acting with a deliberate
 intent to kill his former paramour.

His defense, however, argued that the alcohol-addled man did not know what he was doing when he lopped off Gomez's hands.

‘Armando sits here, ashamed of himself, as he should be,’ one of the defense attorneys said, according to the station Fox5.

The jury also heard from Domingo Cortez, who was dating Gomez at the time of the attack. He claimed in court that his predecessor was jealous, the Las Vegas Sun reported.

Mr Vergara-Martinez wept as his brother read a letter that the defendant wrote before the attack, apologizing to his parents for something bad he planned to do to Gomez. 

The tragedy played out March 21, 2012, outside the supermarket at 530 East Craig Road, where Miss Gomez worked.

She told CBS in 2012: 'I tried to open my car. He started hitting me without saying [anything].

'He stabbed me two, three times on my head. I felt such strong hits over there.

'He cut these three fingers and left it on the floor.'

Successful operation: Doctors were able to reattach Gomez's lopped off hands

Grisly: It is believed that Gomez was using her hands to protect her head from the machete blows

Scalped: The skin on the woman's head was split, and doctors said she could have been decapitated had her attacker aimed the machete blade a few inches lower

On Tuesday, a shopper who was at the Green Valley 
Grocery that day testified that she remembered hearing a 
‘ka-ching’ sound each time the machete blade made contact with Gomez’s 
body.

Doctors said at the time that Gomez could have been decapitated if her attacker had aimed a couple of inches lower.

Medical staff who reattached Gomez's hands believed she was protecting her head with them when she was knifed.
