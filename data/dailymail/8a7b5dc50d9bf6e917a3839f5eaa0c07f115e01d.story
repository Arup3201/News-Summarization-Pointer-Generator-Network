New sat-nav technology will tell drivers how much to adjust their speed to sail through uninterrupted green lights.

The project, masterminded by academics at Newcastle University, is being developed to ease traffic jams, as well as cut the pollution caused by start-stop driving.

Set for trials in Newcastle and a range of other European cities, the system will set a particular speed to ensure vehicles hit the next four sets of traffic lights before they turn to red.

Soon to be a thing of the past: Newcastle is to 
trial a new sat-nav technology which will help drivers avoid heavy 
traffic and could even tell them how fast to drive to avoid getting 
caught by red lights

Phil Blythe, professor of intelligent transport systems at Newcastle, said: 'What's unique about this trial is that we will be giving information directly to the driver.

'For example, the system might advise a driver that if they travel at 24 miles an hour they will hit the next four sets of traffic lights on green.

'In more congested areas or particularly busy times of the day, then key roads might be given priority in order to keep the traffic flowing.'

Two other benefits of the system will be a forward collision warning and a red light violation warning, which tells drivers when someone has jumped a red light.

'Unique': Phil Blythe, professor of intelligent 
transport systems at Newcastle University, is one of the academics 
behind the £8.6million scheme

The pilot is part of a £8.6million project called Compass4D involving Newcastle and six other European cities.

Dr Yvonne Huebner, from Newcastle University, who is leading the project in the UK, said: 'Newcastle is already leading the way in intelligent transport systems and this work will allow us to build on the infrastructure that is already in place to provide personalised information to drivers.

'Every year there are more cars on the road and although there are initiatives in place to keep our cities moving congestion is still a major problem.

'And it’s not just car drivers. By creating a joined-up information system for all road users we can give other users such as the emergency services and bus drivers information which can help them get to their destination quickly and safely.'

The new project will link an in-vehicle communication system directly with the Newcastle’s Urban Traffic Management Control centre.

Information collected by the centre will be sent directly to drivers,  warning them away from jams to speed up journeys through the city and ease traffic congestion.

At the same time, drivers can also be warned of approaching danger such as an accident or reckless driver.

Among the systems being implemented by the team are:

Tyne & Wear's Urban Traffic Management 
Control centre: The centre will send updates to drivers warning them of 
congestion and approaching danger or how fast they need to drive to move
efficiently

Tyne & Wear's Urban Traffic Management 
Control centre: The centre will send updates to drivers warning them of 
congestion and approaching danger or how fast they need to drive to move
efficiently

Other cities taking part in the Europe-wide project include: Bordeaux, France; Copenhagen, Denmark; Eindhoven-Helmond, Netherlands; Thessoloniki, Greece; Verona, Italy; and Vigo in Spain.

Councillor Nigel Todd, deputy cabinet member for environment and transport at Newcastle City Council, said:  'Newcastle City Council supports co-operation with European partners as a means of learning from one another to address our common challenges.

'By being outward facing, the free flow of ideas and experiences can help all cities meet their goals for a cleaner environment.  In particular, Compass 4D builds on our strong track record in Intelligent Transport Solutions, benefiting from our close links with the University of Newcastle.

'As partners, we will actively support Compass4D as we share its vision towards developing sustainable transport solutions, safety and environmental care.'

Professor Blythe added: 'This project builds on many other world-leading research projects that the University has led over the years - bringing state of the art traffic management to Newcastle.

'The in-vehicle unit will communicate with the smart traffic lights controlled by the city’s UTMC. 

'This will be the first trial of its kind in the UK, putting the city at the forefront of new and innovative thinking as to how emerging technologies can help us better manage our increasingly congested roads in the future.'

Aims to ease traffic jams and cut pollution caused by start-stop driving

@highlight

System will be trialled in seven cities across Europe

Information will tell drivers about road conditions around the town
