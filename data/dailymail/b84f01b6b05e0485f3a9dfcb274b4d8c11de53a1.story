The former Labour mayor who lifted the lid on Ed Miliband’s chaotic campaign to become an MP has claimed his ‘questionable’ personality makes him unsuitable to be Prime Minister.

Martin Winter, 52, said he welcomed Mr Miliband into his home for four months in 2005 to try and get him elected as the Labour MP for Doncaster.

But he said over those nine and a half weeks he ‘started to see behaviours… which were questionable’. The former Labour mayor said Mr Miliband was not a suitable world leader.

Mr Winter, appearing on the BBC’s Daily Politics this morning, brandished the Muslim prayer mat Mr Miliband gave him as a Christmas present to replace a carpet he had accidentally set fire to.

He claimed the incident showed the Labour leader did not live in the real world, because ordinary people would know it is offensive to the Muslim community to gift a prayer mat.

Mr Miliband has confirmed the former Labour mayor’s account of his chaotic time at Mr Winter’s family home.

In a speech in Westminster last week, the Labour leader tried to make light of his habit of getting into scrapes.

Jokingly referring to himself as ‘an Islamic arsonist’ and ‘secret Muslim’.

He also implied that the former mayor of Doncaster – where Miliband is an MP – is a nonentity.

Mr Miliband, at Prime Minister's Questions today, allegedly told Mr Winter that Ed Balls (left) backed a snap General Election in 2007 because ‘the economy is going to fall off a cliff and this is our best chance'

Mr Winter claims the Labour leader’s ‘clueless and arrogant’ behaviour while he lived with his family in the run-up to the 2005 General Election made him lose faith in him.

Today he said: ‘I welcomed Ed Miliband into my home. We started to see behaviours in those nine and a half weeks which were questionable.’

He said Mr Miliband confided in him that Gordon Brown should go for an early election because the economy was about to crash.

Mr Miliband told Mr Winter that Ed Balls backed a snap General Election in 2007 because ‘the economy is going to fall off a cliff and this is our best chance of winning an Election’.

Mr Winter said: ‘In my front room Ed Miliband stood there and said it was going to happen. All I know is that is what he told me. I’m quite prepared to take a lie-detector test.’

But Mr Miliband told a Westminster dinner last week: ‘I kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person – not the head of the World Bank, the IMF, or the governor of the Bank of England, but someone at the epicentre of global finance – the mayor of Doncaster.’

He also made light of the other revelations in Mr Winter’s book ‘Fallout, the man who made Ed Miliband’.

The Labour leader said: ‘They [the Mail on Sunday] revealed how I gave Martin a Muslim prayer mat to cover up a singed carpet.

‘I just thought it was what we in the Jewish community call a nice piece of schmutter.’

He said he was going through an ‘Islamic arsonist phase’.

But Mr Winter responded: ‘Mr Miliband can sneer all he likes. He cannot deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house. In mocking a local political ally he mocks all his supporters and his own town.’

For in nine and half weeks between March and May 2005, when the Winter family took Mr Miliband into their home and orchestrated his election as MP for Doncaster North.

In 2002, the former rugby league player stood for election as mayor on an anti-corruption manifesto – and won.

He was invited to Downing Street and sat next to Blair at a Cabinet-style summit to reform local government.

In March 2005, then Chancellor Gordon Brown asked him to help Ed Miliband, his chief economic adviser, win Doncaster North when the sitting MP fell ill.

At a secret meeting in the Treasury, Winter promised Brown he would secure the safe Labour seat for Miliband.

During the campaign, Mr Miliband moved in with the Winter family and used their home as his base for his campaign.

Mr Miliband won with Winter’s help, going on to become Labour leader five years later.

Having been re-elected as mayor, Winter left the Labour Party and then stepped down in 2009 due to renewed infighting and a series of social services scandals in which seven children known to the council died within three years.

An Audit Commission report said Labour councillors spent more time ‘pursuing long-term political antagonisms’ than improving services.

The book Winter has now written tells how he was recruited by Labour chiefs to end corruption and feuding in Doncaster – and his success in boosting the town’s economic growth with a dynamic regeneration portfolio. The second half tells the story of his falling out with Labour as Winter’s enemies ‘tried to destroy me despite all my loyalty to the party – and to Miliband’.

An expert has confirmed that the ‘Christmas present’ Ed Miliband gave to Martin Winter’s partner Carolyne Hunter is a Muslim prayer mat for the elderly or infirm.

Abu Atik, who sells prayer mats at the London Central Mosque in Regent’s Park, said it had extra padding to help those who need to protect their knees.

Mr Atik said he believed the cotton mat may have been made in Morocco and would cost about £25.

For the elderly: An expert last night confirmed that the ‘Christmas present’ Ed Miliband gave to Martin Winter’s partner Carolyne Hunter is a Muslim prayer mat for the elderly or infirm

He said: ‘It is larger and thicker than most prayer mats that I sell. This sort tends to be used by people whose knees hurt if they use thin mats and who need more protection from the ground.

‘It could be used by the elderly, someone with arthritis or someone who was praying on concrete.

‘Like many mats, it can also be used as a decoration, usually to hang on walls.’

The mat given to Mr Winter and Ms Hunter in Christmas wrapping paper measures 2ft 6in by 4ft, a typical prayer mat size.

Devout Muslims use the mats to pray in the direction of Mecca five times daily. The mats are an important part of the Muslim emphasis on cleanliness while praying. It is considered very disrespectful to get a prayer mat dirty.
