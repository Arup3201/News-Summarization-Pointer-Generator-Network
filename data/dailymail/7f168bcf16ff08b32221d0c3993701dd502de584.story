TV star Martin Clunes left some viewers unconvinced when he attempted to master a Scottish accent in new drama Arthur And George.

The Doc Martin actor, 53, plays Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the three-part ITV series, which made its debut last night.

But his attempt at delivering the novelist's Edinburgh accent left some unimpressed, with many saying that his brogue kept changing in the new biopic.

One Twitter user said: 'Martin Clunes does a good Scottish accent, shame he forgot to do it in the first scene'

Steve Oliver wrote: 'Martin Clunes does a good Scottish accent, shame he forgot to do it in the first scene.'

Matt Hill said: 'Was going to ask what part of Scotland Martin Clunes's accent was meant to be from, but he keeps changing it!'

Shona Gibbs added: 'Don't think I can stand Martin Clunes' Edinburgh accent any longer.'

Mark Grainger wrote: 'The biggest mystery in Arthur and George is where Martin Clunes' accent keeps wandering off to.'

And Adam Cooke said: 'Martin Clunes' Scottish accent is atrocious.'

The show started with more than 6 million viewers, but this slipped back to an average of 5.49 million, compared to last week's Broadchurch finale which averaged more than 7 million viewers. 

Some Broadchurch fans complained when the show returned in the New Year, that the former Dr Who star David Tennant was too Scottish, with some taking to Twitter to claim they needed to turn on the subtitles to follow the action.  

Clunes, pictured, said he was worried about playing Doyle as he was a 'very famous Scotsman' 

Others defended the star, with one viewer, tweeting as 'perfecto-cheese' writing: 'Not every Scot speaks like Billy Connolly!'

William Forbes wrote: 'Really impressed with Martin Clunes' Edinburgh accent.'

Annette Gordon added: 'I thought Clunes pulled off a Scottish accent very well. Very subtle'.

The comments came after the Men Behaving Badly star admitted that he was daunted by the role and that he used a dialect coach to work on his Edinburgh accent.

'Conan Doyle is a very famous Scotsman so I had to speak with an authentic Scottish accent,' he previously said. 'I was terrified at the thought of playing him.'

Arthur And George is adapted from Julian Barnes' book and tells the story of the novelist's attempt to clear the name of George Edalji, who was wrongly convicted of a crime in the 1800s. 

ITV chiefs were left red-faced last night after a modern lorry could clearly be seen in the background of the 1903 drama Arthur & George. 

The drama featuring Doc Martin star Martin Clunes faced mixed reviews last night over the main character's Scottish accent. 

The story is based on the life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who created Sherlock Holmes.

The show's creators took a great deal of time ensuring that the characters were dressed in period appropriate clothing and used vehicles from the time. 

But in one scene, overlooking an area of open space, a modern lorry can be seen slowly moving across the screen from right to left with its headlights switched on.
