It’s the kind of encounter that would cause most adults to squirm in fear or run out of the room screaming.

But the cool-headed two-year-old boy in this video shows no fear as he allows a large spider to crawl all over his body.

Joshua – wearing a Spider-Man shirt – is bolder than most grown-ups as he gleefully takes the spider into his hand at his family’s home in Essex.

The 40-second clip uploaded to YouTube shows the spider crawling along the back of the young boy’s black shirt after his father, Robert, gives it a nudge.

After Robert scoops it up, he shows it off to the camera and then carefully passes it to his son.

The spider then crawls along Joshua’s arm, across his chest and onto his left shoulder.

With nerves of steel, it’s obvious that Joshua has done this before.

The boy isn’t afraid of spiders or insects, and he proved it during the family’s holiday in Florida last April when he volunteered to hold a tarantula.

The spider in this video had been haunting his mother, Kara, for more than a week.

She screamed and ran away when she first spotted it while picking up the washing basket.

Robert picked it up and passed it to his son after they spotted it in their living room last month. No harm came to the spider, as they later freed it in their garden.
