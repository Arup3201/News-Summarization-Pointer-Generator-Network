Married: Friends of Yusra Hussien, who went missing in October, say she has married in Syria

A schoolgirl who fled her family home in Bristol last year to join ISIS has told friends she has become a Jihadi bride, according to reports.

Suspected teenage ISIS convert, Yusra Hussien, vanished when she was just 15 and is believed to have boarded a flight to Turkey in a bid to get to Syria with Samya Dirie, 17, from London.

It is understood she has contacted friends to say she is now married - despite not getting in touch with her distraught family since her disappearance from her home in Easton, Bristol, in October.

Her friends have reportedly told the BBC that the teenager contacted them on social media to confirm she was now married in Syria.

However her family deny the claims and say they are unaware as to whether Yusra has got married.

A woman who answered the door at the family's home today said: 'We have not heard from Yusra. Apparently she has told friends she has got married but we know nothing about it.

'We only heard this when a reporter called to ask us. As far as we know it's not true.'

Speaking last night, family spokesperson Anira Khokhar added: 'The family have spoken to her close friends - which is only two - and they say she has not been in touch with them.

'It is all very difficult for the family who are trying to rebuild their lives.' 

Yusra told her family she would be home late from a school trip but her father raised the alarm when she failed to to meet him at nearby City Academy, where she was a talented student. 

Her aunt, Sucdi Ali, believes Yusra was radicalised online after spending increasing amounts of time on her laptop and smart phone.

News of her apparent marriage comes as two British teenage sisters, who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, posted pictures of themselves on social media during 'self defence training'. 

Zahra and Salma Halane, both 17, of Chorlton, Manchester left their homes last June after becoming radicalised online.

The pictures have been posted on one of the twins' Twitter accounts, and shows four veiled women holding AK-47 assault rifles and handguns. 

They are believed to be part of an all-female religious police brigade alongside former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, who enforce Sharia law on the streets of Raqqa.

Missing: Yusra disappeared from her home in Bristol and is thought to have caught a plane to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria in October

When 15-year-old Yusra went missing, her heartbroken mother Safiya Hussien, 40, pleaded for her to return.

'Please come back. Please, we miss you. Please,' she said. 'I'm your mum, I love you, please come back. Please, please, please we miss you.

'I love you so much, all your brothers and sister, we miss you so much, the house is not the same since when you left.'

Her distraught family said the 'last thing' her brothers and sisters wanted to hear was that she had become a 'jihadist bride'.

Speaking at the time of her disappearance, Ms Khokhar said: 'We have to ensure that as a community - a British community - we all come together and unite and protect those young kids.

'The last thing they want to see about their sister is words such as "jihadist bride" or "radicalisation" or "extremism" because that's not the case at this present moment.'
