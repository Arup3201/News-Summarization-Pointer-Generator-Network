I've done the best job of my life this week. I had to stand around in an Aladdin's Cave-like warehouse in south east London whilst several beautiful women sprayed body oil all over me.

Eight hours straight of female hands roaming all over my body - rubbing lotion, teasing hair, stroking and undressing me - all for the sake of art.

Well, all for the sake of my 2015 calendar anyway. Yes, I know it seems strange to be talking about next year already when we are barely into Spring but they do things well in advance these calendar people.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

This week Spencer got dirtied up for his 2015 calender shoot

In the video below you can see me being petted (not heavy) by a number of beautiful stylists and make-up ladies - to get me all oiled up and dirty. I'm well aware that they were there to do a job, but nevertheless I enjoyed the attention.

That said, four weeks ago when I was given the date for this shoot I was more than a bit concerned. I was not in great nick, I'd let myself go a little bit with some pretty full-on partying and was looking decidedly lumpy and I knew that Signature Calendars and photographer Ruth Rose would want me in little more than my boxer shorts for most of the day.

So I hit the gym hard and had quite a bit of help from my will power in a bottle - Forza T5 Super Strengths diet supplements.

If you are going to turn around weight-loss and toning quickly you have to be pretty committed. Gym at least every other day - hour-long high intensity sessions. I went to Shaun Stafford at City Athletic in London.

Go hard or go home - there's no point just standing round the gym watching other people. Push yourself, get it done, and then feel good about yourself afterwards.

Ok, I'll admit I felt pretty sick a few times when I first started, but one or two T5s in the morning helped with an energy boost, and then one in the afternoon to stop snacking.

Eating clean is another big must - 3 or 4 low or no carb meals a day and nothing after 7pm, and cut down on the booze and late nights (OK, I wasn't great at that).

In total I dropped 12lbs in four weeks and ta-da - now I don't look to bad in a tight vest, pretending to be docker working hard down the shipyards.
