Extortionate roaming charges for using your  mobile phone abroad will be slashed from next month.

The European Parliament has approved a new series of caps on the cost of making calls or browsing the internet when travelling within the EU.

The move is designed to put an end to the so-called ‘bill shock’ many experience when they  arrive home from a holiday or business trip.

Good news! From July it will be cheaper to make calls and use the internet abroad

The existing cap on mobile calls will come down from 35 cents (28p) a minute to 29 cents (23p) from July 1. This will drop to 19 cents (15p) by the summer of 2014.

There is currently no limit on the cost of mobile internet use, which can lead to enormous bills – but from next month there will be a cap of 70 cents (56p) per megabyte, falling to 20 cents (16p) in 2014. Charges for text messages and receiving calls will also be cut.

Pleased: Labour MEP Mary Honeyball said the new charges will ensure hardworking people aren't left out of pocket

The caps will not apply for anyone heading outside the EU, but these customers will receive a warning message if they are approaching a data download charge of €50 (£40).

German MEP Angelika Niebler said: ‘Using mobile devices abroad remains expensive.

‘During the summer holidays, our citizens will be able to take advantage of more favourable tariffs. Parliament has succeeded in its call for cheaper roaming prices for consumers, and in particular for data roaming.’

Labour MEP for the South-East Peter Skinner added: ‘Brits travelling abroad this summer will really feel the difference in their pocket. It will be cheaper to make a call, send a text or check Facebook or the football scores online. When you’re travelling, you often want to download data, to find out about places to visit, for example. So there will be a dramatic reduction in prices, particularly for internet use.’

Mary Honeyball, Labour MEP for London, said: ‘For far too long, exorbitant and unnecessary fees have cost EU citizens.

‘These charges are unjustifiable and we finally have been able to intervene and set up sensible fees which don’t put ordinary hard-working people out of pocket.’

Monique Goyens of the European consumer group BEUC said: ‘This welcome news is the latest step down from sky-high roaming costs. What is significant here is the first ever cap on data roaming, meaning it will now cost a maximum 70 euro cents per megabyte, falling to 20 cents in 2014.’

However, she added that, ‘given the proliferation of smartphones and, more notably, the actual cost of data provision for operators, this is still too high . . . bear in mind that’s €700 (£561) per gigabyte’.

She continued: ‘The issue of transparency remains a concern.

‘A recent EU-wide survey found 74 per cent of consumers are hesitant to use their phone abroad to call, check email or download photos for fear of cost. This latest battle for fairer pricing can only help reduce that number.’

Although the cuts will be welcomed by consumers, mobile networks have responded to previous caps by increasing other charges to recoup any lost income.

From July, a 50p cap will stop you running up a huge bill if you forget to switch your phone's data roaming function off.

Using your phone in another EU country will cost no more than:
