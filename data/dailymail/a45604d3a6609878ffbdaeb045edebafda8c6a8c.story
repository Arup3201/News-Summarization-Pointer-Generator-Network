Jailed: Shamin Uddin was jailed for 19 years for his part in a sex gang which exploited two vulnerable teenage girls, one of whom said she was dismissed as a 'nuisance teenager' when her mother asked social workers to intervene

A schoolgirl who fell victim to a sex gang has claimed she was dismissed as a 'nuisance teenager' and placed in a string of care homes by social workers after her family begged them for help.

The youngster, who came from a loving family and was a 'model' pupil at school, was raped after she was lured into an 'underworld' of drink, drugs and wild parties.

When her mother tried to intervene, the girl was placed in a series of care homes and was assumed by council officials to be 'misbehaving'.

Details of the case emerged as three men were jailed for a total of 37 years for sexually exploiting the vulnerable teenager, known as Girl A, and another youngster, Girl B.

Shamin Uddin, 26, nicknamed 'Sham', was 
jailed for 19 years after being found guilty of raping both girls, 
who can not be named for legal reasons, attempted rape and sexual activity with a child.

His brother Giash Uddin, 27, nicknamed 'Gee' was found guilty of sexual activity with a child and jailed for six years, while Robert Jackson, 23, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after he was convicted of one charge of rape.

Two other men were 
cleared of sex charges at Manchester Crown Court.

During their ordeal, the girls were taken to hotels and houses and passed around for intercourse - often when they were too drunk to protest.

The girls, then aged 14 and 15, would drink until they were physically sick, and at times were unable to lift their heads from the bed as the men took it in turns to rape them, it was said.

The school friends said they were escorted to different parties around Manchester - which sometimes lasted days - and were expected to sleep with men.

One of the girls’ mothers even telephoned one of the abusers when her daughter came home 'intoxicated' with chewed and reddened lips and bruised legs - only for him to reply: 'It’s nothing to do with me - I have a wife and family.'

Stockport Safeguarding Children Board are now considering whether to carry out serious case reviews in respect of the way they dealt with the youngsters.

Speaking after today's sentencing, Girl A, now 18, from Stockport, Greater Manchester said: 'At the time I didn’t realise what was happening to me - I thought it was normal. I thought this was what young girls did and this was what boyfriends did to their girlfriends.

'I thought that I knew better than my
parents. I was young, I was naive. My mum started to notice that 
something was going on but unfortunately because of how bad things had 
got my mum couldn’t deal with it the right way so it caused conflict 
between us.

'I didn’t tell 
her anything, I would shout and she would shout at me and I would go out
and she would be worried and calling the police.

'She
asked for help and it was disregarded. The local authorities just 
thought I was being a teenager and a nuisance and just misbehaving.

'Nobody took notice and it wasn’t until it I had got so badly involved that I was coming home intoxicated by drugs and being sick and really poorly that the authorities took me seriously, by this point it was too late, I was too involved.'

She added: 'There were opportunities were people could have helped but I was just being moved to different care homes in the same area. My family had asked for help numerous times and they just didn’t get any.'

Manchester Crown Court was told the girls met the men in 2008 after one was introduced to them through another girl before being 'used and abused as available bodies for sexual pleasure.'

Girl A added: 'I had never been to parties before. In school I had good grades, I come from a good family. My parents worked, I wasn’t used to doing anything like this.

'I had never drank alcohol before. Maybe at Christmas I would be allowed one small glass of wine with lemonade, but I never drank alcohol, I never smoked cigarettes, I never swore, I never used to wear make up.

'I had never been in trouble in school, never been in trouble with the police - this was a completely different world to me.

'I had met older girls from school and this is what they were doing. Because I was younger I looked up to them and followed what they were doing. It was not something I had done from being young.

'These girls were introducing me to guys who had really nice cars and lots of money and smoking cigarettes and weed and buying expensive beer and driving fast in cars. I was excited by it -, anybody would be excited by that.

'It wasn’t until I got to about 16 
and I realised that something wasn’t right. The fast cars had stopped 
and there was no more excitement to it, this was just what was going on.
I had just got caught up in it.

'I
wasn’t able to tell anybody about it. My relationship with my family 
had broken down so much that there was no communication there so that I 
couldn’t go and speak to my parents or aunts and uncles. I was so 
confused - I didn’t know what was going on.'

Girl B also regularly went missing from home leaving her mother and grandmother 'worried sick' about her.

She was introduced to the men through Girl A, and during one early encounter recalled going to a house at 5am after drinking Jack Daniels and wine.

She was said to be 'sick, hyper and giddy' and started dancing and drinking Tequila before having sex with one of the men.

Later, at a hotel, she was raped as three men laughed and pointed at her on the bed.

Police began investigating in 2011 after social workers became concerned about girls going missing from home and 40 girls were spoken to.

Girl A later took officers to one of the houses where she had been raped. Girl B picked out the gang at identity parades.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Marsh, who has led the investigation, said: 'This group exploited the fact their two young victims were vulnerable and impressionable, bombarding them with a constant stream of attention and gifts of alcohol.

'I would like to praise the courage of these two young women who have stood up and given evidence against these despicable men at court, meaning they are no longer free to prey on other vulnerable young girls such as themselves.'

David Mellor, Chair of Stockport Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'Every member of the SSCB is committed to working together to prevent the sexual exploitation of children, protect those at risk of exploitation, ensure offenders are brought to justice and help people to recover.

'Additionally, the SSCB will now consider whether to conduct serious case reviews in respect of the two young people.'
