Instagram users were locked out of the picture sharing site today as it experienced server issues.

The site, which is owned by Facebook, was forced to apologise to users after many took to Twitter to complain of the problems.

The site is believed to have hit problems for around an hour from 4:30Pm ET.

Users of Instagram's app found them selves unable to log in this afternoon as the site suffered technical problems

Users were hit with an error message saying the 'login server' could not be reached.

'Sorry, we couldn't complete your request,' an error message on the site read.

'Our team has been notified and will investigate as soon as possible.'

The firm soon took to Twitter to acknowledge the problem.

'We're aware of an issue affecting Instagram, and should have a fix shortly.

'Thanks for your patience!' the firm tweeted.

Users took to twitter to vent their displeasure - while others immediately began making jokes.

#instagramnotworking also became a trending hashtag as the firm worked on a fix.

'Instagram is down - describe your lunch to me' one popular picture proclaimed.

The firm is locked in battle with Twitter for the lucrative photo sharing market.

Earlier this year, Twitter overhauled its photo system in a bid to compete with Instagram, allowing up to four pictures in each tweet.

The firm has also added to ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters.

The move is the latest in the battle between the social networks, and comes after Instagram owner Facebook revealed it was buying virtual reality firm Oculus.

Twitter now allows us up to four photos to be attached to a single tweet

Friends can be tagged in Twitter's mobile apps.

If you’re the one being tagged, you’ll get a notification.

You can adjust notifications, as well as who can tag you, in your Settings.

'We’re rolling out two new mobile features that make photos on Twitter more social,' the firm said.

'One is photo tagging, which lets you tag the people in your photo; the other is the ability to include up to four photos in a Tweet.'

The move is seen as a direct move to compete with Faceebook and Instagram's photo features.

Twitter also revealed that the added photo capabilities wouldn't eat into the number of characters users have.

'Tagging doesn’t affect character count in the Tweet — you can tag up to 10 people in a photo and still have all 140 characters at your disposal, making it easier to connect with your friends.'

The new design follows a number of changes. In March, for example, Twitter posted a blog announcing a new range of photo options. Users can now add up to four pictures in each tweet. The firm also added the ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters

The multiple picture feature is also automatic.

'You can also share a series of photos that automatically create a collage.

'Just tap on a preview to get the full image and slide through the group.'

The ability to upload multiple photos is starting to roll out today on iPhone, and is coming soon to Android and twitter.com, the firm said.

Instagram (pictured) was acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn and has over 200million users across the globe. The company said that it is 'methodical and deliberate' about choosing which brands will pop up in users' feeds
