The legal appeal for condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday.

It comes after Friday's news that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's executions have been indefinitely delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings.

The delay and new appeal have been welcomed by the pair's legal team, as well as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, both of whom have voiced their optimism at the prospect for a repeal to the execution sentence, reports Yahoo News.

The new appeal will be the men's second challenge to the clemency bid which was rejected in January.

Michael O'Connell, one of the lawyers for the two Australians, said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo.

'The indications that we've had yesterday are encouraging because there does now appear to be some regard to his principles.'

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped the appeal represented a possible shift in the stance of the Indonesian government.

'There could be other reasons for the delay but I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind,' she said.
