Saracens’ Alistair Hargreaves, the man set to replace Steve Borthwick in Saturday’s Heineken Cup final, is preparing for the biggest game of his life.

The 18st heavily-bearded former Springbok second row, who played in the same school cricket team as South Africa batsman Hashim Amla, is no household name in England.

But the 6ft 7in giant could be by 7pm on Saturday when Saracens will be crowned European champions if they beat Jonny Wilkinson’s star-studded Toulon in Cardiff.

Stepping up: Alistair Hargreaves could start in the Heineken Cup final following an injury to Steve Borthwick

‘I
 try not to let the occasion  overwhelm me and I try to keep my 
preparation pretty consistent,’ said the 28-year-old, ‘but if you look 
at it, it probably is the biggest game of my life.’

Mark
 McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, tried to be positive about 
Borthwick’s injury situation yesterday, insisting the former England 
captain still had a 50-50 chance of playing after aggravating a pectoral
 muscle injury in last Saturday’s Aviva Premiership semi-final win over 
Harlequins.

But other club 
sources hint that the likelihood of the 34-year-old playing at the 
Millennium Stadium — or at Twickenham in the Premiership final a week 
later — are considerably slimmer. A final call will be made on Thursday.

Steve hasn’t trained all week,’ said McCall. ‘If he doesn’t play it would just prove that life’s unfair.’

If
 Borthwick does not recover, the likelihood is Hargreaves will partner 
fellow South African-born lock Mo Botha in Saracens’ second row as they 
seek to lift the Heineken Cup for the first time.

Concerns: Saracens captain Steve Borthwick suffered a shoulder injury at Allianz Park on Saturday

‘We
 all owe a duty to Steve,’  Hargreaves said. ‘He is such an important 
part of this club and the evolution of this club, but you can never 
replace a guy of that calibre directly.’

On
 Saturday Hargreaves stepped in for Botha at short notice after the 
former England lock had a back spasm in the warm-up. Hargreaves went on 
to produce a near-faultless display as Saracens came from behind to 
secure a place in the  Premiership final against  Northampton on May 31.

The
 four-times capped Springbok from Durban, a popular figure at Allianz 
Park, is a multi-talented sportsman who could have played cricket for a 
living.

‘I was a decent all-rounder,’ said Hargreaves, whose beard is almost a match for that sported by his old chum Amla.

‘I
 was at Durban High School which has a proud cricket history and I was 
fortunate to play on the same side as Amla because bowling at him in the
 nets wasn’t fun. You’d end up chasing leather all afternoon.

‘His
 average as a schoolboy was in the 90s and he’s gone on to be 
consistently among the best batsmen in the world. He was quiet, humble. 
Everything you could ask for from a world-class sportsman.

Farewell: Captain Borthwick played his last game at Allianz Park with the hard-fought win over Quins

‘People
 rub off on you as you grow up. How you grow up and the people you grow 
up with shape you and I’d like to think he has had some influence on my 
career, although not directly.’

Hargreaves
 is to be married back home in Durban in the middle of June but before 
then he faces two games that could define his career, against Toulon and
 Northampton — the sides who knocked Saracens out of the two major 
tournaments at the semi-final stage last year.

‘I
 hope we’ve learnt from last year and we’ll have a couple of new tricks 
up our sleeves. The occasion won’t get the better of us like  it 
possibly did last year,’ said Hargreaves.

He
 and his team-mates will fly to Cardiff on Saturday morning — though 
goalkickers Owen Farrell and Alex Goode will travel the  previous day by
 private jet to  practise under the closed  Millennium Stadium roof.

‘We like our players to sleep in their own beds the night before a game,’ McCall explained.

Chris
 Ashton will start on the wing for Saracens against Toulon after 
receiving a written warning from the RFU for his crass attempt to 
distract Quins’ Nick Evans, who was about to kick for goal, by shouting 
at him.

‘It’s been dealt with and we move on,’ McCall said.
