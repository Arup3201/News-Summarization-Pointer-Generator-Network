The World Health Organisation has said that research into a dangerous new man-made mutant form of the bird flu virus will be made public in full at some point.

However, the publication will not come until scientists have had time for 'a much fuller discussion of the risk and benefits
of research in this area, and risks of the virus itself,' according to an official.

The agreement in principle to release the details of the deadly virus breaks days of deadlocks over whether the dangers of it being used as a weapon outweigh the advantages for researchers trying to find a vaccine.

Deadly: The new man-made genetic mutation of the lethal H5N1 virus can be transmitted by coughs and sneezes

Scientists, health officials and 
science journal editors have this week been locked in talks on whether 
the study should be released amid fears it could be exploited by 
bioterrorists.

The 
controversial research shows how to make a mutant strain of the H5N1 
virus, which kills roughly half of those who contract it, more 
contagious.

Earlier, the editor of a leading science journal had said that it is his duty to release the information.

Dr Bruce Alberts, editor of Science, 
did not publish after officials from the U.S. National Science Advisory 
Board for Biosecurity intervened, in an unprecedented move, warning of 
the risks if the virus fell into the hands of 'those who would seek to 
do harm.'

Dr Alberts said: 'Our position is we have to publish in complete form.'

'In the absence of any 
mechanism to get the information to those scientists who need to protect
their populations and to design new treatments and vaccines, our 
default position is that we have to publish in compete form.'

Scientists believe that publishing 
the details of the research is essential to developing flu vaccines. Dr 
Alberts says creating a vaccine is essential in case the strain evolved 
in the wild.

'This is likely to happen at some point in the wild because these viruses are mutating very actively in the wild,' he said.

A World Health Organisation summit in Geneva this week is discussing the problem.

Experts
warn that whatever the outcome of the meeting, censorship will not stop
scientists getting the tools to create and release a pandemic H5N1 
virus if they were intent on doing so.

'It
doesn't matter how much you restrict scientists from doing good, bad 
people can still do bad things,' said Wendy Barclay, an expert in flu 
virology at Imperial College London.

The
WHO called the 'closed door' meeting, set to begin Friday in Geneva, to
break a deadlock between scientists and U.S. biosecurity chiefs.

American
officials want to censor the work of two research teams, one in the 
Netherlands and one in the U.S., who have found that just a small number
of mutations would allow deadly H5N1 to spread between mammals like 
ordinary flu.

The United 
Nations health body has said it is 'deeply concerned about the potential
negative consequences' if the findings were to make their way into the 
public domain.

On January 
20, flu scientists from around the world declared a 60-day moratorium on
any research involving H5N1 that could produce more contagious forms of
the virus.

At this week's 
meeting, the researchers who made the findings and the editors of 
Science and Nature, the two journals asked to withhold publication, will
meet officials from the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for 
Biosecurity (NSABB) which asked for the papers to be censored.

Keiji
Fukuda, the WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Security and 
Environment, who will chair the meeting, says he would like to secure 
agreement on whether the studies should be published, in full or part, 
and who should have access to them.

The
findings are seen as vital for scientists to be able to develop 
vaccines, diagnostic tests and anti-viral drugs that could be deployed 
in the event of an H5N1 pandemic.

'It
is important that research on these viruses should continue,' Mr Fukuda
said. 'They do pose a risk. There's a lot of things we don't know about
them.

'The question is not
really should we continue to do research ... but under what conditions 
can we do it so we don't unnecessarily create fears and risks.'

First
detected in Hong Kong in 1997, the H5N1 virus remains entrenched among 
poultry in many countries, mainly in Asia, but so far remains hard for 
humans to catch.

It is 
known to have infected nearly 700 people worldwide since 2003, killing 
half of them, making it far more deadly than the H1N1 swine flu which 
caused a pandemic in 2009/2010.

Ron
Fouchier, the scientist leading the Dutch team that gave H5N1 various 
genetic mutations and made it transmissible in mammals, argues the 
research must be published.

He says it could help public health 
officials better prepare for a scenario where the virus mutates and 
becomes more deadly, spreading from person to person via coughs and 
sneezes.

He has also said 
other research teams around the world are close to the same findings, 
some of them inadvertently, and should be warned in advance how the 
virus could become airborne.

In
the short term, most scientists agree the moratorium is 'a good 
gesture,' as flu expert and former WHO health security adviser David 
Heymann describes it, one that offers the research community space to 
think.

Still, Mr Heymann, Ms
Barclay and many other scientists argue that stopping this type of 
research into flu viruses and other potentially lethal pathogens would 
set a dangerous precedent.

Although adding and deleting genes can create super-strains that put the entire world at risk, Heymann said, the work is vital to developing effective vaccines and diagnostic tests which will be needed quickly if a pandemic hits.

Stopping the research would prevent researchers from using all possible scientific options to prepare for naturally occurring, or deliberately caused, outbreaks.

John Edmunds, head of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says studies on mutations of H5N1 are 'important work' that must go on.

'This flu strain has the potential to cause such enormous damage, and it's important to know how far away we are from a horrible event like that,' he said.
