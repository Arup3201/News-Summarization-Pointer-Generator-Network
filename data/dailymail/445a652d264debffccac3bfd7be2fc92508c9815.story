A bride-to-be has made a brave leap into married life in a more dramatic fashion that most.Â 

Meredith Lewallen, 26, rappelled down the side of a 20-story building on Thursday to celebrate her wedding this coming Saturday - and raise funds for charity in the process.

In a white dress, harness and helmet, Miss Lewallen eased her way over the side of the SunTrust building in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

The brave bride told the Times Free Press: 'As soon as they saw the white dress, I heard a bunch of cheers and woo-hoos and I thought, OK, I've got to go, there's no turning 
back.'

She admitted that walking down the aisle on Saturday should be a little easier than her adventurous rappel - as long as she didn't trip.

The 26-year-old was part of a fundraiser for River Rocks Chattanooga which donates to ecological projects and nature reserves.

Another 70 thrill-seekers were expected to rappel the building, having raised at least $1,000 for their place.

The ten-day RiverRocks festival is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts with yoga sessions, canoe trips, climbing and cycling. Started in 2009, the events are now attended by around 50,000 people.

The 279ft SunTrust building was built in 1968 and stands in downtown Chattanooga, a town of 160,000.
