The taxpayers' bill for ferrying prisoners around in taxis leapt by almost 10 per cent last year, it emerged tonight.

The Ministry of Justice admitted that in 2013-14 it spent £3.4million on taxis for inmates, up from £3.1million a year earlier, but insisted it was an 'economical mode of transport'.

The revelation is especially embarrassing after a Treasury minister last year said the bill was a 'scandal'.

The bill for taxis for prisoners last year hit £3.4million, the highest since the first year of the coalition

Ministers insisted using taxis was an 'economical' way of transporting criminals, instead of buying dedicated prison vehicles.

According to figures released in response to a parliamentary question, the bill for taxis for prisoners came to £3,417,595, up from £3,133,614 last year. 

It is the highest the bill has been since the first year of the coalition. When last year's sum was revealed, Tory MP Priti Patel called it a 'scandal'. 

She is now a minister at the Treasury, which has demanded a tighter grip on spending.

The figure is for the cost of transporting prisoners for public sector prisons in England and Wales.

Tonight Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is already paid to private companies to ferry around prisoners, and so the public will be confused why an additional £3million had to be shelled out last year for taxis for prisoners. 

'Many people are struggling to pay their bills on a day to day basis, and taking a taxi for them is a rare luxury. 

'They will look at offenders being shuttled around in taxis and question what has gone wrong with the world.

'We need competent Ministers who know what they are doing rather than this shower. 

'This is yet more evidence of the shambles at the Ministry of Justice. David Cameron's government really do need to get a grip before any more of the hard pressed British public’s money is wasted.'

The Prisoner Escort Custody Service (PECS) is responsible for moving prisoners around the country, between prisons, police stations and courts and their care and security while in court custody.

It runs contracts for secure escorts for all inmates, apart from Category A prisoners.

But sometimes taxis are hired to drive them around instead of standard prison vans.

Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: 'There are occasions when the prison service may make use of taxis to provide prisons with a cost-effective, flexible way of fulfilling transport requirements for prisoners where there is a strong operational justification for doing so.

'This is an economical mode of transport (particularly in comparison with using cellular vehicles or purchasing cars). It reduces potential overhead costs for prisons, such as maintenance and cleaning, which have an impact on staff time. 

'Prisons are able to access this form of transport at short notice, in response to urgent requirements.'
