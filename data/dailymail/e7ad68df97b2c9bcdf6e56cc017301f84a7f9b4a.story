Former Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall has criticised Liverpool's Simon Mignolet by stating the Belgium shot stopper's handling 'isn't the best'.

Southall joked that Mignolet is among his current top 20 Premier League goalkeepers but added he did not feature high up on his list.

Writing in his Paddy Power blog, Southall said: 'All I can say about Simon Mignolet is he's definitely in my top 20 of Premier League goalkeepers.

Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has been criticised by former Everton custodian Neville Southall

Southall does not believe Mignolet is capable of following in the footsteps of Bruce Grobbelaar and Pepe Reina

'And trust me, he doesn't feature very high on it. When they first bought him, I was surprised.

'When you think of the great Liverpool goalkeepers Tommy Lawrence, Ray Clemence, Bruce Grobbelaar, Pepe Reina - he never struck me as a player capable of hitting those standards.

'His shot-stopping is good, his distribution is decent, but he isn't the best on crosses.'

Southall believes the current standard of goalkeepers in the Premier League is 'poor'.

He added: 'Hugo Lloris is world class, but after that, I'm not convinced.

'David de Gea has come on a tonne and could enter that world class bracket in time and Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea looks like the real deal, but being world class comes from concentration and long term consistency.'

David de Gea and Hugo Lloris are among the three best goalkeepers in the league, according to Southall
