Theo Walcott took to Instagram to show off his birthday cake from his Arsenal team-mates ahead of their Champions League showdown with Monaco on Tuesday night.

Walcott turned 26 on Monday and Mesut Ozil was among those wishing the England international a happy birthday on social media.

While the perfect present may be qualification for the quarter-finals, Ozil wrote on Twitter: 'Happy 26th birthday to my friend @theowalcott #Stayhealthy #bestwishes #Gunners'

Walcott, meanwhile, wrote on Instagram: 'Thank you to everyone for all the birthday messages today and a nice birthday cake surprise with the team.'

We know what he may be wishing for as Arsenal need to overturn a 3-1 deficit from their first leg in the Champions League last-16 tie at the Emirates.

It sees a return to Monaco for manager Arsene Wenger, who was in charge of them between 1987 and 1994.
