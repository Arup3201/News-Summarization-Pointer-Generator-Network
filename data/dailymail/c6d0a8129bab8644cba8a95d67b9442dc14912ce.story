Staffordshire Police said the man's body was found on a street in Stafford, West Midlands, at around 12.50am and confirmed they had arrested a man on suspicion of being unfit to drive through drink or drugs in connection with the incident.

Specially-trained police officers were with the family of the victim, who has not been named, a force spokesman said.

connection with this incident remains in police custody and will be 
questioned by officers as the investigation progresses.
