Hugh Jackman and his former classmates are 'sad, angry and disappointed' at the testimony of their former headmaster at the prestigious Sydney high school Knox Grammar at an inquiry into child sex abuse at the school.

Dr Ian Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, gave evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse on Tuesday and Wednesday, today admitting to impeding a police investigation into allegations of paedophilia from teachers.  

Jackman was among many who live-streamed Dr Paterson's testimony in New York on Tuesday morning Australian time, exchanging emails with around eight of his former classmates at the exclusive school, according to best friend Grill Team radio presenter Gus Worland.

Dr Ian Paterson, pictured here on Tuesday, has provided more than a day-and-a-half of evidence to the Royal Commission, which is examining sex abuse at Knox Grammar School. Dr Paterson was headmaster of the school from 1969 to 1998

'He's as absolutely gobsmacked as everyone that what we thought (about the school) was very different,' said Worland.

'He and another friend were watching it on the live stream and the rest of us were watching when we can.'

'We wake up this morning to a whole heap of emails from all our mates and it's just sad. 

'And the overwhelming feeling and emotion is one of just absolute anger, disappointment, sadness for everyone involved.' 

Worland and Jackman dealt with Dr Paterson in their roles as a former senior prefect and school captain. The pair attended the Knox Preparatory and Senior Schools from 1978 to 1986. 

Worland told Daily Mail Australia last week they were keenly anticipating the evidence from Dr Paterson, who they respected and feared at school.

Dr Paterson was widely known by the nickname 'The Snake' because of his 'autocratic style' while he was at the school. 

'He was the power in the land,' Old Boy Peter FitzSimons told Daily Mail Australia outside the hearing on Tuesday. 'He was the Parliament and the King. '

But Mr FitzSimons said that while Dr Paterson appeared to be 'running a tight ship' to his unaware students, many were unaware of the 'carnage below the decks'. 

'There's no excuse for his inaction to help those children and to get those paedophiles out of that school,' Worland said today. 

'It makes us old boys extremely angry to think that a man who shaped a lot of our lives the stuff we thought we were basing us on was a lie. 

'He put the school's reputation and what people thought of the school ahead of looking after those kids who were being abused. 

'There's no excuse for that.'
