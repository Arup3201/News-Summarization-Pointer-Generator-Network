A 15-year-old girl has died after losing control of her racing car during her first time on the track.

Niokoa Johnson was driving her own Nissan Sentra when she lost control during her second lap of the Bubba Raceway Park in Marion County, Florida during a time trial on Saturday afternoon.

Niokoa, who was the only driver on the track, slammed into a concrete barrier, crumpling the front of her car. She was unconscious when racetrack workers and witnesses pulled her from the vehicle.

The teenager was taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center before being flown to Shands Medical Center in Gainesville, where she was breathing and underwent surgery.

But she was pronounced dead at 3pm on Sunday, WESH reported.

The Marion County Sheriff's Office is looking into the incident and treating it as an accidental death investigation, a statement said.

Friends set up a fundraising page to help her single father, Richard Johnson, and brother, Dakota, as they start to make arrangements for her funeral.

In images and messages shared on his Facebook page, her father - also a racing fan - had expressed his excitement at Niokoa's first car and day on the track.

He shared photographs online as he and his daughter prepared the car for its first drive.

Her sister, Nakiya, said she was grateful for the support from witnesses and strangers and that her sister died doing something she had longed to do.

'Tonight was her first race and she had been waiting for this night for a
 while and she was super excited and happy to be where she was,' she wrote on Facebook.Â 

Her father told Eyewitness News that she had wanted to get behind the wheel since she was little.

'I was tightening her helmet up and 
she grabbed it and pulled it tight and said "I got this",' Richard 
Johnson said, adding that he is struggling to accept her death.
