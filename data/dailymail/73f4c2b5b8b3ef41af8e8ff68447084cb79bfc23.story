We are better off and have access to more medicines than ever before.

But new research shows we're a nation embroiled in a health crisis, wilfully neglecting our wellbeing and expecting the already overburdened NHS to pick up the pieces.

The study, which looks at the the average health of men and women in the UK, reveals some alarming statistics about our diet and lifestyle, dubbed by experts a 'ticking timebomb'.

The UK National Health Report, from Beneden Healthcare, reveals the vast majority of us fail to follow basic health guidelines, leading to a population that is overweight, overtired, unfit, poorly nourished and dehydrated

The UK National Health Report reveals that the vast majority of us fail to follow seven out of eight basic health guidelines, leading to a population that is overweight, overtired, unfit, poorly nourished and dehydrated.

We're constantly being told that to be 'healthy'. We should eat five portions of fruit and veg a day, have a body mass index (BMI) of between 18 and 25, drink 1.5-2 litres of water a day and aim for seven hours of sleep a night.

Smoking is obviously out, while men should drink no more than 21 units of alcohol a week and women 14, according to official Government guidelines.

And when it comes to exercise, we should all be doing at least 150 minutes of (at least) moderate (if not high) intensity physical activity each week.

But in reality, it seems things are very different, the report from Benenden Health shows. 

It was compiled after questioning 4,000 people across the UK to paint a portrait of 
what Mr and Mrs Average look like from a health perspective.

When
 it comes to men, Mr Average eats 3.3 portions of his ‘5 a day’, has a 
BMI of 26.2; only drinks 953ml (less than a litre) of water a day and 
sleeps for 6.4 hours a night.

Experts say we are aware of what we should be doing to maintain good health, but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us

And it seems we aren't deluded - we know we are unhealthy - we just can't be bothered to do anything about it - most likely because we know the NHS is on hand to fix us, the report suggests

He also does just 73 minutes of cardio a week and 1.4 muscle strengthening work outs; smokes 3.8 cigarettes a day and and drinks 13.6 units of alcohol a week.

Ms Average fares slightly better on the food front, managing 3.5 portions of her ‘5 a day’.

However she too has a higher than average BMI of 25.9 and drinks even less water than her male counterpart: 896ml of water.

She also sleeps for 6.5 hours a night, does 69 minutes of cardio a week and 1.1 muscle strengthening workouts. She smokes 3.3 cigarettes a day; and drinks 8.4 units of alcohol a week.

Experts say we are aware of what we should be doing to maintain good health, but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us.

For example, despite failing to meet 
the Department of Health's recommendations, the report reveals that the public knows it 
should be eating ‘five a day'.

Respondents aged 16-24 eat the fewest portions (2.9), while those aged 65-74 eat the most (4.1).

The study, which looks at the health of the average health of men and women in the UK, reveals some alarming statistics about our diet and lifestyle, dubbed by experts a 'ticking timebomb'

It seems we aren't deluded - we know we are unhealthy - we just can't be bothered to do anything about it - most likely because we know the NHS is on hand to fix us, the report suggests.

When asked how 
healthy they think the nation currently is, 71 per cent of respondents answered 
either ‘not very healthy’ or ‘not at all healthy’.

When asked the same 
question about the nation’s health 50 years ago, only 29 per cent of respondents
 answered negatively.

The
 report also explores the mental wellbeing of the nation and reveals 
women fall victim to stress more than men (48 per cent and 35 per cent 
respectively).

They 
are also more likely to have suffered from depression, anxiety and 
insomnia and loneliness (on average around 40 per cent of women for each
 condition compared with 30 per cent of men).

The
 different sexes also deal with stress differently. Both parties watch 
TV to unwind, but women are more likely to read a book or have a bath. 
Instead, men are more likely to turn to alcohol.

The
 report also reveals the worrying statistic that Mr Average has a BMI of
 26.2 and Mrs Average has a BMI of 25.9. Both these figures indicate 
someone who is overweight and at an increased risk of developing heart 
disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.

BMI is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. 

Using their BMI as a gauge, more than half the population (52.5 per cent) is 
classified as either overweight or obese, with 6 per cent deemed 
underweight. A total of 42 per cent of the population has a healthy BMI.

Experts say that staying hydrated is also key to good health - and staving off hunger pangs.

Those aged
 35-44 drink the most water (1 litre a day), and the over 85s drink the 
least – on average, just 487mls a day.

It is not a lack of 
knowledge on the subject that leads to the nation drinking too little, as half of us know we should be drinking more.

And
 while Margaret Thatcher may only have needed four hours sleep a night, 
it is widely accepted that 7-8 hours is the optimal amount of sleep 
needed.

However,
 Mrs Average only manages 6.5 hours a night, while Mr Average has 
slightly less (6.4).

The report also explores the mental wellbeing of the nation and reveals women fall victim to stress more than men (48 per cent and 35 per cent respectively)

The different sexes also deal with stress differently. Both parties watch TV to unwind, but women are more likely to read a book or have a bath. Instead, men are more likely to turn to alcohol

Those aged 16-24 get the 
most sleep (7 hours a night on average), while those over 84 have the 
least (5.5 hours).

Commenting on the findings, medical 
director of Benenden Health, Dr John Giles, said: 'At a time when modern
 medicine is making consistent major breakthroughs to give us longer 
lives and treat illnesses that even 20 years ago were fatal, the UK 
population appears to be doing everything in its power to make those 
extra years as unhealthy and miserable as possible.

'We cannot continually rely on the NHS 
to pick up the pieces of our below average approach to looking after 
ourselves: this laissez-faire approach is massively overburdening our 
country’s health service.

'An ageing population and advances in medical science, alongside the surge in complex chronic illnesses, mean the NHS as it was originally conceived is becoming increasingly threatened.'
