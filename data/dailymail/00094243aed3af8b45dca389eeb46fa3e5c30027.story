A hiker was arrested and warned she could face jail after freeing an eagle from a trap and springing three more traps to protect other animals.

Kathleen Adair, 39, was walking her three dogs up Davies Creek Trail in Alaska on Christmas Eve when she spotted the bird with each leg shut inside traps.

She spent an hour freeing the creature before alerting a bird rescue firm.

Heading home, she also sprung another trap which she spotted in the ground - prompting an investigation by Alaska Wildlife Troopers that landed her in court.

Eventually tracked down by authorities she was charged and hauled to court facing a $500 fine and 30 days in jail.

Arrested: Kathleen Adair, 39, was charged with hindering lawful trapping after snaring three traps in Alaska

The eagle was found and euthanized three days after she freed it. 

'What we expect from the public is if they come upon an eagle in a trap, to notify us as soon as possible. That way we can go out there and see what's going on,' Alaska Wildlife Trooper Sgt Aaron Frenzel told the station. 

Defending her actions, Adair told the Juneau Empire she is not 'an ecoterrorist trying to ruin trappers' livelihood.'

'I grew up hunting and fishing here, I've got several animal skins on my walls,' she said. 'I don't personally trap, and I don't choose to, I don't want to, but I'm not going to stop someone else from doing it. I only object when the traps are on the trail where I think they are safety concerns.'

Speaking to KTOO, she said: 'I knew at the time that the eagle didn't have a very good chance. I knew if I left it there all night, it would have had a worse chance of surviving.

'But even as it was, I could tell one of the legs was just dangling, just completely broken and I knew they wouldn't be able to fix that, but I was hoping they could at least fix the other and keep it as an educational bird.'

'I wanted to go back and tell the Raptor Center where it was. I knew that would be the best thing to do, but I also knew that it would be getting dark soon.

'It was two miles from the road and it was all the way at the end of the road, so I knew that they wouldn't be able to get out there that day to it.

'I'm not against trapping per se. I am concerned about the traps when they're on the trail in such a way as these were,' Adair said.

On Thursday, the case was dismissed by a judge who called Adair's work 'admirable'.

'Her actions in saving the eagle were laudable,' Juneau District Attorney James Scott said during Adair's arraignment on Thursday afternoon. 

'She should not have to run the risk of a conviction on her record for this offense.'

'When she's hiking and she comes across an eagle in a snare, I encourage her to rescue that eagle again, and I will screen that case out as well,' the district attorney added, according to the Empire.
