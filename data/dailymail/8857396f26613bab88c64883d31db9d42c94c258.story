Mesut Ozil's form going into the World Cup is an ongoing concern for Germany, with Michael Ballack intimating that his move to Arsenal hasn't worked out.

The 25-year-old was in and out for the Gunners during his first season in the Premier League since Arsene Wenger splashed £42million on him from Real Madrid.

It can often take foreign imports - regardless of how highly thought of they are - time to adapt to English football and Ozil has expressed his surprise at the domestic intensity.

What's happened? Ballack argues that Ozil is a different player since his move to Arsenal

That matters little to Joachim Low though as the Germans head into a so-called 'Group of Death' against Portugal, the USA and Ghana.

Ozil is a playmaker they need, and have relied on in previous tournaments, with Ballack hopeful he will click into gear. 

'It’s difficult to say where his head is going to be at the World Cup,' the former captain told the Daily Star.

'He has done well for Germany and he played well during the qualifying campaign but in the last few months - since his move to Arsenal - he has not been the same player, in terms of his confidence, that we used to see in the national team.

'I don’t know whether the Arsenal move has affected him because he was untouchable and in Germany we still expect him to be one of our best players.

'As one of our best players he has to take more responsibility, and we expect more from him at the moment. Hopefully, when the World Cup starts, we will see a different player.'

They haven't enjoyed ideal preparation for Brazil after disappointing draws against Poland and then Cameroon. Ozil played in behind the striker in the latter but failed to exert much of an impact.

Given Low's decision to take Miroslav Klose as his only genuine striker, Ozil must begin to deliver.

'I saw him 
play for the national team at the weekend and I was not surprised, not 
scared, but a little bit concerned, by his performances,' Ballack admitted.
