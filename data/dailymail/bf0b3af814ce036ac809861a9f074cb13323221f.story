It's been a whirlwind few days for Pippa Middleton, who was pictured leaving Wyoming after reportedly being hired by NBC's Today show. 

The Duchess of Cambridge's  younger sister was spotted at Jackson Hole airport in Wyoming after apparently inking a deal to be a correspondent for the popular NBC show. 

Pippa had been shopping for gifts and a teddy bear, possibly for her nephew Prince George, was peeking out of her bag.

The Duchess of Cambridge's 31-year-old sister was seen wheeling her case to a waiting SUV at JFK around 5pm on Monday, dressed in a pristine Mackintosh with coordinating Loewe 'Amazona' purse which costs around $2,400. 

Less than 12 hours later, jet-setting Pippa was back at Kennedy to catch an outbound flight, dressed comfortably in a padded jacket, glasses and ankle boots. 

Pippa flew to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where she was spotted at a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras. It is believed that she was filming a test piece for the Today show.

'She was moving fast' one local said on social media after Pippa surprised everyone by popping up (with a camera crew) in Jackson Hole 

According to the Daily News, the freelance columnist is hoping for a deal 'upward of $500,000' to report on lifestyle and health issues for NBC. 

Pippa has been in talks with the 'peacock network' for a new job after she was interview by Matt Lauer this summer, Page Six first reported, then confirmed to MailOnline by sources. 

NBC News previously denied that a deal was in the works but the network has reportedly been in serious talks with Pippa for months about becoming a lifestyle and health correspondent.

Excited locals in Jackson Hole, posted pictures all over social media of Miss Middleton this week, dressed in boots, skinny jeans and wearing a checked shirt. 

Pippa performed a routine which involved some twirling and sashaying with an elderly gent in a cowboy hat before going on to have a drink at the bar. 

Emily hash-tagged one video clip with 'pippamiddleton' before saying that she had told the 31-year-old she was happy she visited, and received a gracious smile as a reply. 

Another person at the bar, Wyomingsith, remarked that she was 'moving quickly' and had only stayed for around ten minutes.

Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network.

It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role.

NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.

It is highly unlikely that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits. 

She is not the first with Royal connections to cash in as Charles Spencer, the brother of the late Princess Diana, also had a gig at NBC in the 1980s.

The Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, also dabbled in TV in the 1990s, forming the production company, Ardent, in 1993. 

The company made a number of documentaries and dramas but was voluntarily liquidated in June 2009, with total assets amounting to $65. 

Test run: Pippa Middleton's interview with Today's Matt Lauer in June brought in big ratings 

In 2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was denied by the network.

During her interview with Matt Lauer in June, which marked Pippa's first-ever TV appearance, the glamorous socialite shed light on her relationship with her sister, who is a member of the British Royal Family through her marriage to Prince William. 

Pippa seems set to join 'peacock' network NBC following months of secret talks over the deal  

Asked about her relationship with Kate, Pippa said she and her sister are still very close and enjoy doing 'sisterly things'.

Miss Middleton famously stole the spotlight during the Royal Wedding in 2011 when she donned a curve-hugging white bridesmaid’s gown for the ceremony.

Pippa's media career has suffered a few minor setbacks this past year.

Her party-planning book, Celebrate, suffered disappointing sales, and in May it was announced that Middleton had been dropped as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph after just six months. 

She still writes for Vanity Fair and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose.

Pippa is currently dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 36, who in July took a new job at a hedge fund in Switzerland. 

However according earlier reports, the couple's relationship has gone stale, Nico told friends. 

Pippa was recently spotted enjoying lunch with millionaire hotel tycoon Andre Balazs at his A-list haunt the Chiltern Firehouse in Central London. 

Balazs, who is now reportedly dating pop starlet Kylie Minogue, is known for his web of celebrity connections and owns several U.S. hotels including the Chateau Marmont in LA and New York's The Standard.
