A man has been arrested on several counts of child molestation after a teenage boy claim he was sexually abused by him from the age of 12.

Donald Vincent, 29, a youth ice skating coach was the boy’s trainer and is said to have repeatedly molested the teen for three years.

The alleged abuse of the now 17-year-old victim took place at Mr Vincent’s home in Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles, and there may be other victims, officers said.

Accused: Donald Vincent has been charged with three counts of child molestation

Mr Vincent was a youth ice skating coach for seven years and worked with children at many local ice rinks in Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange County.

‘The information came to light in December 2012 when the now 17-year old victim told a friend at a youth camp, who then told another person,’ Lieutenant Carlos Marquez of the Special Victims Bureau told Los Cerritos News.

‘They then encouraged the victim to report the abuse.

'The victim told sheriff’s investigators that he was repeatedly molested by his skating coach at the coach’s Hacienda Heights home, when he was between the ages of 12 to 15.’

He was charged with one count of Continuous Lewd Acts With a Minor, and two counts of Lewd Acts with a Minor, Ages 14 or 15 at Pomona Superior Court on Monday.

His bail is set at $1million.
