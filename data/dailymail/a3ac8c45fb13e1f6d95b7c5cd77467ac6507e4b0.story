Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend Nick Gordon has gone on another extraordinary Twitter rant against her father - claiming he has hardly seen the 21-year-old in years before her accident and is only interested in the family's money.

The 22-year-old, who has reportedly been banned from visiting his comatose girlfriend in Emory University in Atlanta, told Bobby Brown to 'grow up' - insisting Whitney Houston's only daughter will hate him when she wakes up.

The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before she was found face down in a bathtub. 

Gordon also insisted he has taken care of her '24/7' since her mother died in 2012.

On Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown.

The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.'

He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her.

'Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.'

The messages were quickly deleted from his profile, however he continued to shame Bobby Brown's parenting skills, heating up his feud with the family.

He wrote: 'Crazy how all the Browns came to the hospital when this went down. I've been with her 24/7 watching over her and mom. Bobby left when it got heavy.

Gordon then claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs.

Before adding: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.'

His followers quickly got involved in the conversation, some sharing messages of support and others were what he described as 'negative allegations' 

'Listen at the end of all this I took care of Whitney Houston and Kriss which was very hard on someone my age' he wrote. 'They cried on my shoulders!!!!'

'Grow up': Gordon uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to Bobby Brown. In them he insisted Bobbi Kristina will hate her father when she wakes up 

Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Ho

Parenting: Gordon accused Bobby Brown of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant 

Referring to the night she was hospitalized, he said: 'My only regret is not getting to [Bobbi] faster to give CPR.'

On Sunday, he posted: 'I can't wait till she wakes up and dismiss all of the negative thoughts. There is a reason why her mom made me promise to look after her.'

Bobbi Kristina, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston has been hospitalized in Atlanta since being found unresponsive on January 31 in a tub at her Georgia home.

Police said Gordon was performing CPR when emergency responders arrived at the home. 

Gordon tweeted in anger on Saturday, saying he had been denied access to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend.

'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' he tweeted on Saturday. 

Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks 

Regrets: Referring to the night she was found face down in a bathtub, he told his followers he wishes he could have done more to save her. Police said they arrived and found him giving CPR 

A lawyer for Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, said in a statement on Sunday that Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions.

'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe. At least not desperate enough to inform Bobby Brown, in writing, what happened to Bobbi Kristina,' attorney Christopher Brown told E!.

But Gordon's attorneys said R&B singer Brown has consistently denied Gordon permission to visit.

They said they advised Gordon not to agree to the conditions set by Brown. The conditions have not been made public.

The attorneys said Gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with Brown.

According to NBC, Brown's statement said that because Gordon had failed to spell out what happened to Bobbi Kristina, 'there is no reason for any additional discussion with him'. 

Reports have suggested Gordon may by the subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital.  

Nick Gordon, who has been frozen out by the family for weeks, insisted his presence will help the 21-year-old in this tweet on Saturday 

Sources have claimed that Bobbi Kristina used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother Whitney Houston three years earlier (mother and daughter pictured together at a Grammys party in 2011)

In his Saturday rant, Gordon also tweeted: 'If she hears MY voice let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help. If you ask Bobby anything abt [sic] he cannot answer.'

He posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo of Bobbi Kristina's name on his arm alongside the message: 'Healing fine just like my baby.'

Last Wednesday, Gordon's lawyer Randall Kessler said his client 'desperately wants to be with the one he loves'.

Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claimed Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay 'hands on him' if he showed up.

Kessler said: '[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.' 

Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. 

A new report which surfaced on Saturday claimed that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub.

In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. 

Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago.

One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'.

She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital last month after being found by  Gordon.

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. 

Last week, she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy.

Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition.

Gordon reportedly has become the main focus in a criminal investigation by police in Roswell, Georgia.

Prior to being hospitalized, Bobbi Kristina had been in a car crash, according a police report. 

The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said.

The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said. One of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.
