Comet Lovejoy has made a surprise appearance in an image taken by the world's most powerful digital camera.

The comet sprung up in a photo snapped taken by the 570-megapixel Dark Energy Camera as it was scanning the southern sky.

At the time this image was taken, the comet was passing about 51 million miles (82 million km) from Earth. It appeared as a burst of green light against sky full of stars.

The comet sprung up in a photo snapped taken by the 570-megapixel Dark Energy Camera in December as it was scanning the southern sky. At the time this image was taken, the comet was passing about 51 million miles (82 million km) from Earth. It appeared as a burst of green light against sky full of stars.

'It reminds us that before we can look out beyond our galaxy to the far reaches of the universe, we need to watch out for celestial objects that are much closer to home,' wrote the team on the Dark Energy Detectives blog.

The Dark Energy Camera is sensitive to light up to eight billion light years away, and so was able to capture the view in incredible detail.

The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is designed to find out why the expansion of the universe is speeding up, instead of slowing down due to gravity.

It is currently looking into the mystery of dark energy, the force believed to be causing that acceleration.

he comet's centre is a ball of ice roughly three miles (5 km) across, and the visible head of the comet is a cloud of gas and dust about 400,000 miles (640,000 km) in diameter. Pictured is a shot taken by an amateur astronomer earlier this year

Comet Lovejoy was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world.

The comet’s centre is a ball of ice roughly three miles (5 km) across, and the visible head of the comet is a cloud of gas and dust about 400,000 miles (640,000 km) in diameter.

The comet's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the sun.

Its tail takes on a blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains. 

Comet Lovejoy was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers, and he named the comet.

To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory.

It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world.

Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice.

As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight.

They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers
