When The Only Way Is Essex's Tom Kilbey started dating Lydia Bright, it was clear he was never going to be best pals with her ex-boyfriend James 'Arg' Argent.

But relations between the pair reached breaking point earlier tonight when Arg told Tom his sister Cara had claimed his relationship with the blonde fashionista wouldn't stand the test of time.

Although the duo initially seemed to have put their differences to one side as they attended a musical showcase by TOWIE co-star Jess Wright, Tom later confronted Arg about his claims.

Fuming: Tom Kilbey flew into a rage when Arg made comments about his sister Cara

Blood is thicker than water: Tom was angry that Arg had insinuated Cara doubted his relationship with Lydia

He said: 'I've spoken to Cara, she says she didn't say that. Blood is thicker than water, so obviously I side with her.'

As Arg - who is now dating Gemma Collins - stood by his claims, it wasn't long before the argument reached breaking point.

Shouting at his former pal outside the venue, Tom said in a foul-mouthed tirade: 'You're a f***ing mug and you're chatting s**t about my sister. Pipe the f**k down and stop chatting s**t about my family.

Friends: It initially seemed as though the boys had put their differences behind them

A calming influence: But the night ended with Lydia having to steer her boyfriend away from the fight

'You're trying to make her sound like a b***h and you're lying. You're a doughnut, mate.'

Although Tom was eventually dragged away from the argument by Lydia and her best pal, Danni Parks-Dempsey, that certainly wasn't it for fight night.

Mark Wright's triumphant, albeit brief, return to the show for sister Jess's performance was eclipsed by a whole host of other feuds coming to a climax.

It was somewhat of a deja vu for Gemma Collins, who got into an angry shouting match with ex-boyfriend Charlie King and their mutual pal Bobby Cole Norris at the gig.

After Bobby confessed his love for Charlie last week, the sandwich shop owner was left fuming when he discovered the Gok Wan lookalike had discussed his feelings with Gemma, who had always suggested there was a hint of romance between the pair.

A frustrated Charlie said: 'She's trying to dig up the past. I'm trying to get a girlfriend and obviously I can't because there's constant speculation that I'm gay.'

But after confronting Gemma about her comments, it spiralled into a huge argument between the threesome.

'You should have spoken to me': Bobby was devastated when Charlie reprimanded him for discussing his feelings with Gemma

Gemma shouted: 'Go and talk to your little boyfriend about it. Bobby has been confiding in me and now you're both ganging up at me.

'You [Bobby] come to me in my flat and confide in me and insinuate that something touchy-feely happened in Marbella. You two are a pair of Jeckylls. Essex is so two-faced.'

Elsewhere, the tension between former friends Lucy Mecklenburgh and Sam Faiers continued to bubble, with Sam claiming she had proof the brunette bombshell's fiance, Mario Falcone, had cheated on her with another girl.

Angry: Gemma was absolutely fuming when ex-boyfriend Charlie accused her of spreading rumours about him

Argument: Bobby sided with his pal Charlie over Gemma

Lucy fumed to pals Lydia and Danni: 'If she had proof why when I went round to her house, why didn't she give me it then rather than start it all up again? What the f**k?

'The girl is a mutual friend of mine and Mario. She's investigating it to try and prove herself right.'

The boutique owner also accused her blonde co-star of stabbing her in the back when over Christmas 2010 she slept with Mark Wright the same day Lucy had split up with him.

Lucy added: 'This isn't the first time she's stabbed me in the back. I broke up with Mark Wright and she went home in a cab with him and s*****d him that night.

'She's stabbed me in the back': Lucy confided with Danni and Lydia about the cheating rumours

Trust me: Mario Falcone insisted he had nothing to hide from Lucy

'That's not a friend. Perhaps I should have drawn a line under it years ago.'

And finally Joey Essex went to confront new Essex playboy Jamie Reed after he recently bragged about sleeping with Joey's sister Frankie.

He said: 'It's disrespectful. It's upset me, it's upset my family. People have got the hump with you.'

After Jamie offered to send Frankie a Â£50 bouquet of flowers, Joey flew off the handle - insisting only a face to face apology would do, and baffling Jamie with his Essex lingo in the meantime.

He fumed: 'I want you to say sorry to her face, she don't want flowers from you. I think you're a bit of a mug. A proper lunchbox, I think you are. Ta-ta.'
