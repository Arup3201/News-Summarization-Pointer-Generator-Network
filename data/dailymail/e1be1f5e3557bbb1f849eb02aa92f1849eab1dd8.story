Being on the Mediterranean coastline, Gibraltar is quite a windy place.

So on their royal visit to the former colony yesterday, Sophie, Countess of Wessex unwittingly ended up revealing more than usual of her legs when her dress was lifted up by the wind.

But being a royal, the Countess was well prepared when an ill gust of wind disturbed her pristine outfit yesterday and managed to save the incident from becoming a Marilyn Monroe moment.

Good weather: Despite the wind, the couple have been blessed with sunny weather during their stay

For the couple's busy day, former PR Sophie wore three different outfits, and was expected to have changed into a fourth for her evening engagements.

For their visit to the Botanical Gardens and the Naval Base, where a Royal Air Force plane perform a flypast, the mother-of-two wore a black and white optical illusion shift dress.

She later changed into a green and white fern-patterned dress with beige jacket and matching hat for a parade in honour of the Queen.

The Queen's image was projected on to the iconic rock, beside an image of the Union flag, prompting raised eyebrows among the Spanish media because, due to where it was placed, the sight could only be seen from Spanish soil.

Spaniard Antonio Jimenez, 40, draped himself in the Spanish flag as he watched from the nearby Playa de Levante.

He said: 'It's an act of provocation. It's a political act, a conflict which serves no purpose for the people who live either side of the border.'

Another wore a Spanish national football team shirt and screamed 'Gibraltar Español' as the Queen's image appeared.

Their trip has already been roundly 
attacked by the Spanish government, which is said to be 'displeased' at 
their patronage of the former colony.

The
 Earl of Wessex and his wife's journey has already infuriated the 
Spanish government, and follows a recent dispute over fishing rights off
 the peninsula, a UK territory which Spain also claims.

During
 their three day trip, they will attend events and meeting stately 
figures, laying a foundation stone for Gibraltar’s Diamond Jubilee 
Monument, attending a Queen’s Birthday Parade and visiting the 
headquarters of the British Forces.

But Spain's foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo has called the trip 'deeply unfortunate'.

Tensions
 between Britain and Spain have increased in recent weeks, with Spanish 
fishermen demanding the right to fish in Gibraltar waters, in breach of a
 1999 ruling.

Some 59 Spanish boats based in towns near the Rock are affected by the ban on using their nets there.

Last
 month, in the shadow of the fishing dispute and the planned royal 
visit, Queen Sofia of Spain pulled out of attending a Jubilee lunch at 
Windsor Castle - a move which came at the request of the incensed 
Spanish government.

Back in the UK, Her
 Majesty hosted a garden party at Sandringham and thanked members of the public for their their contribution to 
community life, including a lady who had volunteered for Meals on Wheels 
for 23 years

A
 fanfare from the band of the Royal Marines marked the arrival of The 
Queen and Prince Andrew who proceeded to mingle with the event's 3,500 
guests

Last 
week, a group of Spaniards was escorted out of Gibraltar for their own 
safety after angering locals celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Back in the UK yesterday, the Queen attended a Diamond Jubilee garden party event with 3,500 guests at Sandringham.

She was accompanied by Prince Andrew as Prince Philip is still in convalescence, continuing to recover from a bladder infection.  

Her Majesty, attired in apricot, thanked ordinary members of the public for their contribution to community life.

These included  Joy Bradshaw, 80, who 
was invited in recognition of her 23 years volunteering for Meals on 
Wheels.

'I cared for my parents for 20 years and decided to volunteer after that,' she said.

'It was enormously rewarding because sometimes I was the only person who ever visited some people.

'I was so surprised to be invited here today and it is a wonderful honour.'
