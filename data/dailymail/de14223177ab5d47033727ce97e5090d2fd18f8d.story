Cristiano Ronaldo has been crowned as the best player on the planet for the third time - and he celebrated by clenching his fists and then yelling inaudibly into the microphone.

The Real Madrid and Portugal forward claimed the 2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or award at a ceremony in Zurich on Monday evening after he received 37.66 per cent of the vote ahead of Lionel Messi (15.76 per cent) and Manuel Neuer (15.72 per cent).

And upon taking the stage and receiving the award from former Arsenal and France legend Thierry Henry, Ronaldo gave a short speech before celebrating by shouting something largely inaudible.

It cannot be sure what Ronaldo shouted, although it sounds like he was yelling: 'TWOOO!'

If that is indeed the case, this could be in reference to the two-consecutive Ballon d'Or awards he has now claimed to add to the first trophy he won back in 2008.

Before his extraordinarily passionate outburst, Ronaldo said: 'I can see my mother, my family. I would like to thank all those who voted for me. My coach, my fellow player, the President of my club.

'It's been an unforgettable year. To win this trophy, a trophy of this kind, is something unique and all I can say is I want to continue working as I have so far, trying to go on to more titles - individual and as a team - for my mother, my father who is up there looking at there any my son.

'I want to get better as the days go by. I want to say to all the Portuguese that I never thought I could win this trophy on three different occasions. Of course it is something that is always with me, I want to become one of the greatest players of all time, and this requires a lot so I would like to thank you for all this evening.'

Ronaldo received his second Ballon d'Or in as many years - was he yelling 'TWO!' in celebration?
