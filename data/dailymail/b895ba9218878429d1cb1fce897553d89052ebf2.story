At the age of 18 Mez Gallifuoco’s dreams were shattered when she was told her future would be in a wheelchair and that she should never try and have children.

Her immune system had started attacking her body's own central nervous system and she was losing feeling in her limbs.

‘I woke up and had pins and needles in my legs and progressively over a week it had reached my waist and I was completely numb,’ Mez, a consultant and founder of Little-Soul.com, told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I could run a knife across there, and couldn't feel hot or cold in the shower. I would burn myself and not realise.’

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves). The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS cannot be predicted. 

MS is a lifelong disease for which a cause and cure are yet to be found; however, doctors and scientists are making discoveries about the treatment and management of MS every day. 

The visible and hidden symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person.

However, symptoms can include difficulties walking, pain, dizziness, slurred speech, emotional and mood changes, memory problems and extreme tiredness. 

Mez had just struggled through her HSC exams, unable to hold her pen, when six months later the teen from Bondi, in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, received a shattering diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis in 2005.

She knew nothing about the disease, other than from a readathon she did at school. ‘All I could think of was a wheelchair. The only association I had was a wheelchair,’ she explained.

‘You know it’s chronic and not something that can be healed.’

Her Italian businessman father, Salvatore Gallifuoco, described the moment he was first told his only daughter had MS.

‘The whole family was ringing and worried. No one knew what to expect. I was so worried about it and felt powerless to help my princess,’ he said.

Now, almost ten years later, Mez has received the incredible news that her MS is in remission.

After being diagnosed Mez, seen her at the age of 21, decided to learn about her disease and took up a science degree

Mez says she was not given a cure or miracle treatment and her recovery seemed to surprise doctors. She believes the relationship she formed with her MS ultimately helped her overcome it.

The 27-year-old, who has been MS free for two months, decided she was going to learn about her disease and signed up for a science degree at The University of New South Wales.

She tried to go to a group session where there were other MS sufferers but found it ‘really sad and depressing’.

‘I remember consciously going I don’t want to be the victim in this, I really want to play the survivor.

‘I know it sounds dramatic but I mean I wanted to take a more active role in this and not be stuck with a death sentence,’ she reasoned.

The average age to be diagnosed with MS is 30-32 so at 18 Mez was much younger than the other sufferers she was meeting.

It took her about a year and a half to find a good neurologist. ‘Because I was so young they wouldn’t talk to me they would talk to my parents.’

Eventually she found one at St Vincent’s Hospital and started treatment at the age of 22 in the form of a  needle which she had to inject herself with daily.

Mez is now a consultant, blogger, photographer and has dabbled in modelling 

She had to inject herself with daily with medication that altered the way her immune system functions

‘It would take me about an hour to have the courage to put it in,’ Mez recalled.

She said that the drug that she was putting into her body – Interferon – felt like it burned as it seeped into her blood.

She found it hard to travel and ‘couldn’t go anywhere with it’ and there were massive side effects because she was so young. She would have fever and chills and throw up for two days afterwards.

‘I was doing uni at the time so my weeks just became shorter,’ she said.

Interferon slowed down the rate of MS by 30 per cent.

Then two years ago, thanks to medical advancements, a new MS drug was brought onto the market, called Tysabri – an antibody that affects the actions of the body's immune system – which slows down the rate by 70 per cent.

Mez’s MS experience became far less invasive when she stopped having to inject herself.

‘A lot of my friends say to me "I forget that you have it",’ Mez said.

Despite her MS, Mez took up the offer to go to New York to work for ten months 

She continued to live her life as happily as she could and formed a relationship with her MS

At one point Mez’s MS spread from two lesions to 26 lesions and her legs started to buckle when she walked.

‘I got a lot of cognitive effects from it. I got really cloudy which is hard when you’re doing a science degree… at one point I couldn’t wear heels anymore, I kept falling,’ she remembered.

Mez described how she formed a relationship with what was happening inside her body, lived really healthily and dealt with the psychological side of the illness.

In May last year she was told it had spread throughout her whole entire spine but she went to New York for 10 months, came back and incredibly found she was in remission.

‘It never happens. My neurologist said “I don’t know how you are walking, you should not be walking with what you have”.

Mez is now raising awareness for MS Research Australia and believes a cure for the disease is not far off

‘I didn’t want to hate something inside me so I just tried to use it as information, I will slow down if I get a flare up. Stress is a massive trigger for MS,’ she explained.

‘There is no miracle drug – not yet anyway… But my body is acting like I never had it. Nerve tissues have regenerated.’

Mez is now raising awareness for MS Research Australia, which supports scientists who believe they are really close to finding a cure.

Her results are also being used as a case study because doctors are so surprised by what has happened.

‘They want to monitor me but I feel good.’ 

Mez’s ten year MS journey coincides with a ground-breaking decade of research that has been carried out by MS Research Australia.

According to MS Research Australia’s recently published Research Audit, MS affects more than 23,000 Australians and 2.3 million people worldwide.

Worldwide, the average onset age is 30. People can be diagnosed at any age, although it is usually in early adulthood.
