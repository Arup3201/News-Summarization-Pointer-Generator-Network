The last time David Moyes stood on the pitch at Goodison Park, it was 
all about him. This weekend, he will return to find not much has 
changed.

Moyes' final game as Everton manager last May saw his team beat West Ham 2-0 and he walked off the field in tears.

'If I had been an Everton fan I would have clapped the manager too,' he said.

Goodison roar: David Moyes enjoys an Everton goal but times change

On
 Sunday Moyes returns with Manchester United as the centre of attention 
once again. This time, though, the climate will be different.

While he has struggled as manager at Old Trafford this  season, his old club have moved on without him. Everton under Roberto Martinez already have more points - 66 - than Moyes ever managed in a season during his 10 years in charge at Goodison Park, and nine more than United.

Supporters, meanwhile, remain irritated by the manner in which Moyes tried to sign Marouane  Fellaini and Leighton Baines last August.

By suggesting Everton do 'what is right for the players', Moyes exposed himself not only to accusations of treachery but also hypocrisy.

In 2009 he had been critical of Manchester City's attempts to sign Joleon Lescott on the back of similar rhetoric.

Man at work: Moyes jokes with his players during a training session on Thursday

'We haven't forgotten, Moyes,' wrote one Everton fan on a fans' forum 
this week. 'And if you have, we will remind you on Sunday.'

Football can be a nasty, fickle business. Moyes knows that. The hero-villain cycle can be ridiculously short.

The story of Moyes' return to Everton, though, has more layers to it than most.

Most surprising, perhaps, has been the apparent attempt by some to sully the Scot's legacy at Goodison Park.

Moyes'
 10-and-a-half seasons on Merseyside saw him establish Everton as a top 
eight Barclays Premier League side during an era when some traditional 
rivals moved on to financial footings Everton could not match. As the 
club swayed under the effect of aborted takeovers and failed stadium 
projects, the team largely remained a constant positive.

New regime: Everton have moved on under Roberto Martinez

Martinez's 
progress at the club this season, though, has encouraged some clumsy 
revisionism.

The Spaniard's team play better football, according to 92 
per cent of those polled on a fan website this week, while stories from 
inside Everton tell of superior inter-personal skills.

More 
surprising, though, were youth coach Kevin Sheedy's Twitter comments 
suggesting Moyes didn't care about young players while one of those 
teenagers, Ross Barkley, has claimed Martinez's training sessions are 
'more tactical'.

Sheedy's words - subsequently deleted - reflected 
badly on him and can be traced back to a breakdown in the relationship 
between the two men. Sheedy, for example, felt he didn't receive enough 
personal thanks when his Under 18 side beat Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup 
last year.

Nevertheless, the words outraged Moyes and didn't impress Everton chairman Bill Kenwright either.

Return fire: Moyes came under fire over his pursuit of midfielder Marouane Fellaini

The
 list of players to emerge from youth academy to first team under Moyes 
is long and impressive.

Moyes was also behind the move to bring the 
first team and youth squads together on one site while in 2009 Everton 
had five youth academy products in their playing squad. Only United had 
more.

This week one Everton source told Sportsmail: 'Some academy 
staff did feel as though Moyes was slow to blood some of their players.
 They thought Barkley was sent on loan when he could have been on the 
bench here.

'But show me a club with a youth academy and I will show you youth coaches who are moaning. It's always the way.'

When Moyes revealed he was leaving Everton that tumultuous week last May, not everyone at the club was sorry.

He
 had little or no relationship with some senior executives, for example,
 simply because he felt his close bond with Kenwright was sufficient.

The club's marketing and commercial staff, meanwhile, were quick to wave goodbye.

'There
 were some sighs of relief, that is true,' said another Goodison source.
 'He was not easy to deal with. The marketing and commercial teams felt 
he was taciturn and that they couldn't rely on his co-operation.

'He 
hardly came to the stadium on non-match days and few people ventured 
down the long corridor to his office at the training ground.

'The 
office was right at the end and some felt it was alien territory almost.
 Very few executives ever ventured down there without an invite and 
those invites never came.

'It was, in a way, classic bunker mentality and most people saw it as strategic.

'In terms of results on the field it worked, no doubt about it. It just didn't make him universally popular.'

Fever pitch: On Sunday Moyes returns with Man United to Goodison Park

At United there have been similar stories about Moyes as relationships with some non-football staff have been slow to develop.

Some
 players remain unsure about their new manager also and it will be 
interesting to see how many apply themselves as they need to on Sunday, 
given their dreadful season is effectively over.

At Everton, though, 
there were no such playing issues. Moyes is criticised by some 
supporters - unfairly you may say - for not winning a trophy while 
others point to a poor record against the really big  Premier League 
teams.

Nevertheless, his Everton players talk of a driven, intense 
man who fought their corner for a decade. During his time at the club, 
Moyes insisted on the best for his players, whether it be training 
facilities or hotels on pre-season tours.

He worked his players 
without mercy in training. That's always been his way. Some teased 
friends at United by text message about the whirlwind of intense labour 
that was coming their way last summer but there are many who still thank
 him for the impact he had on their careers and their lives.

Good move: Moyes has been criticised for his youth policy but Ross Barkley was among those who came through the ranks at Everton

Former 
Republic of Ireland winger Kevin Kilbane, for example, leaned heavily on
 Moyes after fathering a daughter with Down Syndrome in 2004.

'It's 
one of the reasons I respect David so much, because of how wonderful he 
was with me at that time,' said Kilbane. 'On the field he transformed us
 from a team that finished 17th in the Premier League one season to a 
side that finished in the Champions League places the next, even after 
Wayne Rooney was sold.

'You never got negatives from him and I played
 close enough to him on the touchline to know. He can galvanise a squad 
and get the best out of them. He created something special at Everton.'

Certainly
 only the myopic would argue with Moyes' record at Goodison. Everton 
always spent a little more than was made out - Fellaini earned £70,000 a
 week while Sylvain Distin earns £60,000 - but Moyes kept the financial 
wolf from the door by selling well each summer and, on the whole, 
buying astutely.

Bunker mentality: Moyes has a reputation for being difficult to deal with

Some now question his style of football - 
revisionism again - but fellow managers don't. One Premier League boss 
attended a two-day coaching seminar as a young coach given by Moyes in 
2009 and revealed this week: 'He was the first person I heard talk about
 false wingers. He had Pienaar and Osman tucking in and the full backs 
flying along outside them.

'It was brilliant and is still hard to play against now. It was inventive and attacking.

'Moyes was fantastic that  weekend, an on-the-grass coach who ran his club methodically and meticulously.

'Everton still owe him now and will for years to come.'

Boost: United striker Wayne Rooney has been passed fit to face his former club

Whether
 Moyes will feel much love back at Goodison - where United have a good 
record - on Sunday afternoon is questionable. He deserves a good 
reception, of course, but football doesn't work like that.

Some feel 
Moyes should have given Kenwright more notice of his intention to leave.
 As it happened, he knocked on his chairman's door only once the news 
leaked from Old Trafford.

Kenwright, though, is not bitter about 
that. He remains grateful for the professionalism Moyes showed in his 
final days and he knows how the world works.

Many others - as Moyes will  discover on Sunday - do not.

David Moyes returns to Everton on Sunday, the club where he built his reputation. His successor Roberto Martinez has had a good first season at the club but how do their records compare?

IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN

At this stage of the season, Martinez has won more points than Moyes did last year with Everton.

EUROPEAN TOUR

Moyes led Everton to fourth place and Champions League football in 2005. It was the first time since 1971 that Everton had competed in Europe’s top competition. Martinez remains in a battle to finish fourth.

TOP TRANSFERS

With Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry and Gerard Deulofeu all coming in, Martinez has exploited the loan system well this season. But Moyes made some shrewd signings in his time at Everton:

Leighton Baines................£6mPhil Jagielka........................£5mPhil Neville........................£3.5mMikel Arteta........................£2mTim Cahill...........................£1.5mSeamus Coleman................£60,000

42.1% - Moyes’ win percentage at Everton. In just 40 games, Martinez has won 57.5%. That also beats Moyes’ record at United this season — 54%

66 - Martinez has won 66 points with Everton this season with four games still to play. Moyes' highest tally was 65 points over an entire season — in 2007-08

AWARD WINNER

Moyes was regularly recognised for his outstanding achievements at Everton. He was Premier League Manager of the Month 10 times and was LMA Manager of the Year three times. Martinez has been Premier League Manager of the Month once and was League One Manager of the Year in 2007-08.
