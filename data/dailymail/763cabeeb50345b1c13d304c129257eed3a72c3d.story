Swansea City have rejected a £4million bid from Sunderland for Ashley Williams and are keen on Levante midfielder Pape Diop who is valued at £3m.

The Wales international is stalling on a new contract and looks set to leave the Liberty Stadium this summer.

One in, one out? Ashely Williams could leave with defensive midfielder Pape Diop (right) eyed by Swansea
