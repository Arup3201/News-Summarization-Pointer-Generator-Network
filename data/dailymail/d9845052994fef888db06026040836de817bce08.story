Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who is to address the Oxford Union this evening 

The Oxford Union has provoked anger after inviting former English Defence League leader and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson to address students.

Mr Robinson, who left the EDL earlier this year, will speak at 8pm this evening, even though academics and politicians have accused him of 'continuing to incite racial hatred against Muslims'.

The 30-year-old, who was also a BNP member, founded the EDL in 2009 because he was angry that Muslims demonstrated as British troops returned from Afghanistan.

He has convictions for assault, drug and public order offences but has pledged to help tackle racism in Britain since he left the far right party.

It is the third attempt by the Union to get Mr Robinson to address students after his first scheduled appearance was cancelled due to security concerns.

His second attempt to speak had to be cancelled after he was sent back to prison after being convicted of mortgage fraud in January.

But an open letter signed by more than 200 people, including film director Ken Loach, has called for his invitation to be cancelled.

The letter by Oxford Unite Against Facisim states: 'By inviting Tommy Robinson the Oxford Union is contributing to a climate of Islamophobia which only encourages fascists onto the streets of Oxford.

'The Oxford Union should not be giving racists and Islamophobes the prestige of speaking at their institution and we demand Robinson's invitation is withdrawn.'

The organisation are also planning to demonstrate outside the Union from 7pm.

Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, left the EDL in October last year, and has received numerous death threats.

A convicted football hooligan, he was also arrested in May 2012, after allegedly obstructing police as he tried to get close to the spot in Woolwich where Lee Rigby was murdered.

It is the third attempt by the Union to get Mr Robinson to speak after his first two scheduled appearances had to be cancelled 

Mr Robinson confirmed on Twitter that he would be addressing the Union at 8pm tonight and admitted he was a 'little nervous' 

He also confirmed that the subject of his speech would be the EDL, why it formed and its history 

He also claimed 'every single Muslim' was to blame for 'getting away' with the July 7 bombings.

Since he left the EDL he has said that his past inflammatory statements had often been fuelled by alcohol and the adrenaline rush of 'leading the biggest street protest movement in Europe.'

Giving reason for his decision to leave the group, Mr Robinson said he had been sobered by his 18-week stint in prison and by the experience of being shunned by parents when picking up his children at school.

An open letter has been signed by more than 200 people, including film director Ken Loach, calling for his invitation to the Oxford Union, pictured, be cancelled 

He said that he was sorry for creating an 'us and them' culture and for causing fear among British Muslims.

Writing on his Twitter page today, he confirmed he would be appearing at the Oxford Union later this evening saying he was hoping his speech goes ok and that he was a 'little nervous.'

He also added that he plans to talk about the EDL and why he formed it and its history, although he added he was not allowed to talk about certain issues due to him being out of prison on licence.  

The Oxford Union confirmed that Mr Robinson would be speaking tonight but refused to comment further.

In 2007, students demonstrated outside the Oxford Union after then BNP leader Nick Griffin and controversial historian David Irving, a holocaust denier were allowed to address students.

More than 300 protesters gathered at the gates of the Union chanting slogans waving banners.

During the debate, anti fascist campaigners successfully disrupted the proceedings by crashing into the meeting hall and staging a sit-in.

The breach delayed the speeches and split the meeting into two. But the speakers were each allowed to address separate audiences after the hall was cleared by police.

In 1996 the Union also sparked controversy after OJ Simpson gave his only UK appearance to the Union after being cleared of murdering his wife.

Meanwhile the Union has also sparked controversy for inviting certain celebrities to address students such as pop stars the Cheeky Girls and glamour model Jodie Marsh.

In 2011, Katie Price, formerly known as Jordan, addressed the union where she told the spectators who she believes there needs to be tighter regulations on the media.

Other unlikely debaters have also included club owner Peter Stringfellow, TV presenter Keith Chegwin and reality TV show star David Gest.
