Sally Street used to sit at her desk staring at her screen and daydreaming about jazz.

In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity, working for clients such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

But her high-flying legal career is worlds away from her new occupation as a jazz and pop singer, which sees her playing regular live gigs in Sydney nightspots and singing 'flirty' songs on stage with her diamante-encrusted keytar.

Ms Street also used to be half of one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year.

Mr Street is the son of former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also NSW Chief Justices.

Ms Street's mother and her estranged husband are in the middle of a legal battle over a disputed loan worth several hundred thousands of dollars.

For years as a lawyer Ms Street would spend her weeks working – sometimes until 3am in the morning – and her weekends in the garage of jazz musician Freddie Wilson in Hunters Hill on Sydney's North Shore learning how to sing with a live band.

'I worked really hard… And I was totally at the top of my game doing that,' Ms Street told Daily Mail Australia from her home in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

'I used to think in the end there's got to be more to life than this.

'But then when you have a passion that you just have to, at some point you have to just go if I don't do it now I'm never going to do it.'

Ms Street's father was a jazz musician and ever since she can remember she has wanted to be a singer – but he persuaded her to pursue a career in law instead.

'He was never really home but when he was home there was always a house full of musicians jamming, that's all I remember from being a kid,' she said.

'He didn't even turn up to my birth or my wedding because he was at gigs.

'We lived in this really old rumble tumble shack down at Long Reef on the Northern Beaches and all I wanted to do was sing and then my dad said "You can't do that, it's too hard, [the music industry] is not like it was, you just have to go and get yourself a real job" so they made me go to uni.'

Ms Street admits that before she left in 2007 parts of her law career at Mallesons Stephen Jaques (now King & Wood Mallesons) were exhilarating.

In her shows and music videos Ms Street says she likes to incorporate sexiness 'kind of like Cameron Diaz, like girl next door sexy'

'Sometimes board meetings will start at midnight to get a deal over the line, and flying around to stay in swanky hotels and going out to awesome deal dinners,' she said.

But Ms Street said if she had stayed on the law path full-time she believes something inside of her would have been 'empty and sad forever'.

'It's kind of cruel suppression passion. I don't think if you're passionate about something and you supress it you're ever truly happy,' she said.

Ms Street's music career so far has seen her headline jazz festivals in Morocco and perform at the Venetian Casino in Macau, as well as win a handful of song-writing competitions.

She has released independent albums including The Scorpion Maid, One Bite At The Cherry and Little Evil Me, but Ms Street is now looking get a break on commercial radio.

'I get played all across community radio all across Australia all the time but the problem, the biggest challenge is getting onto commercial radio,' she said.

'Without a record label I have no idea how to do that yet.'

She says she likes to be controversial 'just to tickle people up'

Ms Street said after her six-week stint performing in Macau – and being stuck in a hotel for most of the time – she decided she wanted to focus on building her career locally and performing in pubs and clubs.

'Because I wasn't so worried about earning money, because I was married at the time to Sandy so he was like, you know, just do what you love so I kept writing,' she said.

'I was lucky I was able to be able to do what I wanted.'

Following Mr and Ms Street's split last year, Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and her ex-husband have become embroiled in a legal battle over a disputed loan worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Ms McDonald claims she lent the couple money when they were having problems making payments on the mortgage of their Vaucluse home, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Ms Street says she is joined on the claim 'as a matter of procedure' but insists that her mother is not suing her to force her to pay up.

'I adore my mum and she totally loves me,' she said.

'She's actually not suing me for any money at all.'

Mr Street told the Daily Mail Australia he could not comment because the matter is still before the court.

Her divorce has seen her need to return to law to do some consulting work – but music is still her main focus.

'That's just for money, not because I want to do that at all, I don't, and I'd certainly never go back and do it full-time.'

Ms Street said her music and lyrics have also changed since her divorce.

'It's been interesting being single,' she said.

'I haven't released them yet, [but] it's opening up new, love up-and-down kind of songs that I never used to write before.'

Ms Street said if she had stayed on the law path full-time she believes something inside of her would have been 'empty and sad forever'

'Like high school romance, kitschy, hilarious… times I've had on Tinder,' she said.

'I'm not on Tinder anymore, that was fun though!'

Ms Street also takes a lot of inspiration for songs from her friends.

'Most of the girls' nights out, meeting mad people and stories,' she said.

In her shows and music videos Ms Street, who descirbes herself as a 'mischief maker' and a 'flirt' on her website says she likes to incorporate sexiness: 'kind of like Cameron Diaz, like girl next door sexy.'

'I'm out there but not in a perverted way,' she said.

Ms Street's song lyrics can stray into risqué territory – with songs like 'Take Me Home Tonight' and 'Facebook Freak' – and she says she likes to be controversial 'just to tickle people up'.

'People, you know, it's fun pushing peoples boundaries. People are really conservative,' she said. 

'That being said I mean I'm not conservative, I'm not religious, but I think I really believe in you know that book The Secret, just karma and only ever being positive and putting out good out there.'
