A Hollywood actor has relived the day his three-year-old son came to the brink of death - after eating just one cashew nut.

John Schwab was on a family holiday on the Spanish island of Menorca when a severe allergic reaction gripped his son Jack, covering his skin in hives and closing up his throat.

By sheer chance a neighbouring holidaymaker had an adrenaline shot, a miracle which the 41-year-old and his wife Tamsin are convinced saved their son's life.

Shock: John Schwab almost lost his son Jack (left) to a single cashew nut after the young boy suffered a devastating allergic reaction on a family holiday. By sheer chance a neighbour had an adrenaline shot

Danger: The three-year-old spent five days on a hospital ward in Menorca (right) recovering from the reaction

They drove Jack at breakneck speeds to a Spanish hospital, where he spent five days recovering.

At first his eyes were so swollen that he could not see, his father said, and his condition was so distressing that it prompted two junior nurses to burst into tears.

Nine years later, he is a happy-go-lucky secondary school pupil and a chorister at London's Southwark Cathedral - but still carries a rucksack with adrenaline shots everywhere he goes.

Mr Schwab, whose film credits include Zero Dark Thirty and Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets, spoke out about the incident as a warning to other parents to have their children allergy tested.

The actor, who lives with ITV employee Tamsin, their son Jack and Jack's six-year-old brother Sammy in Blackheath, south east London, said the horror of the incident changed their lives.

He became a prominent member of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity and raises awareness of allergic reactions, which the charity says kill 20 people a year.

The charity recorded a heart-warming film of Mr Schwab recalling the incident on the unluckiest day of his life - Friday 13 May, 2005.

Mr Schwab said his son had eaten peanuts and other snacks all his life, but never a cashew nut.

Just 15 seconds after tasting one in their holiday villa, he 'came running into the room with a look of panic on his face', the actor said.

Recovered: Jack (second from left with his parents and brother Sammy) is now 12

'Then he vomited uncontrollably on the floor, and he looked at me with a strange pleading look,' he said. 'I knew something was wrong, very wrong. Instinctively I turned to Tamsin and said, "he's allergic to nuts".

'I would like to say that my wife and I were the personification of calm. I've played doctors on screen and stage, I've watched endless doctors' procedures on television, but all I could come up with was: "get some help".'

His skin covered in hives, Jack arrived with his parents at an emergency room on the Spanish island which Mr Schwab said was full of 'English people with sunburn', and waited half an hour to see a doctor.

By the time they were with the doctor, Jack was having a second reaction - but could not be treated at the clinic. His parents were told to take him to the island's main hospital in a fellow holidaymaker's car.

'Jack took a turn for the worse,' said Mr Schwab. 'He began panicking, he couldn't stop convulsing.

'Our friend turned into a Formula 1 driver - I don't think he stopped for a single red light. He got us to the hospital in 15 minutes, not 30, which I think is still a Menorcan island record.

'We would later learn that this hospital was not equipped for the kind of emergency we had presented them with. From behind the double doors of doom I could hear my son screaming, yelling, pleading.

'I went into the emergency room and Jack already had four needles in him. He was distraught, surrounded by people in white coats and every passing minute brought another doctor running through the doors.

'Of course the medical attendees never spoke English. Then two junior nurses looked at each other and started crying. I wasn't feeling very confident.

A lesson for all parents: Jack is now 12 years old and is a chorister at Southwark Cathedral in south London

Family: Mr and Mrs Schwab said they learned a lot from the experience and now campaign on the issue

'Then I left my body - genuinely and seriously - and I knew in an instant why people have out-of-body experiences, because their heart, mind and soul cannot take what is presented to them.

'I floated in the corner of that emergency room watching myself watch my son die.

Anaphylaxis is triggered when a sensitised individual comes in to contact with one of a huge range of allergens.

These can include nuts, milk, eggs, bee and wasp venom, kiwi fruit, Latex rubber and even exercise.

A reaction can cause a drop in blood pressure, and swelling in the face, mouth and throat leading to a narrowing of the airways, difficulty breathing, collapse and even death.

Parents can have their children tested for most common allergies free on the NHS, via a GP.

The skin prick test involves injecting a trace of the allergen into the skin and monitoring whether it causes a reaction.

The Anaphylaxis Campaign, which recorded Mr Schwab's story, offers advice to parents, schools and caterers to reduce the risk of fatal incidents.

Chief executive Lynne Regent said: 'John and Jack’s story is very moving and could easily have ended
 in tragedy.

'Unfortunately, however, it is the sort of story we hear on a
 weekly basis at the Anaphylaxis Campaign. Deaths from anaphylaxis do 
occur, in fact, there are on average 20 deaths every year.'

'Jack stared at me and said one word: "Daddy". I couldn't tell whether it was a question, a statement, a plea, an affirmation or an acceptance. I answered: "I love you".'

The doctors managed to save Jack, who spent five days in hospital.

He is now 12 years old and attends a secondary school near his London home, where he is even permitted to have school dinners.

Others are not as lucky as Jack. This week an inquest heard how a teenager with a nut allergy died after eating ribs from a Chinese takeaway.

William Luckett, 15, was unaware that the barbecue sauce he ordered near his home on the Isle of Wight was prepared with peanut butter.

After a few bites he began struggling to breathe, the Isle of Wight Coroner’s Court heard. William was taken to hospital by ambulance but died shortly after.

His father Steve Luckett, 45, told the court how he 'cradled' his son as he lay dying.

Speaking of the tragic case, Mr Schwab said: 'It's horrible and it just makes me think how easily it could happen to us, to anyone. It's heartbreaking for the family and my heart goes out to them.'

In Mr Schwab's case, there was more than a hint of the supernatural about events of that day nine years ago.

All day they had searched in vain for a traditional figurine of the Virgin Mary to take home as a souvenir for his father.

And when Mr Schwab asked the mystery saviour with an adrenaline pen for her name, she turned to him and said simply: 'It's Mary'.

At the end of a harrowing day, he phoned his father. 'Dad,' he said. 'I think I found your Mary'.
