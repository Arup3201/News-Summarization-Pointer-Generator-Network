Cam Newton says he feels lucky to be alive after miraculously escaping a car crash with two fractured bones in his lower back.

Two days after the accident, which saw his Dodge pick-up truck flip over two or three times after colliding with a vehicle, Newton returned to the Carolina Panthers facility to begin rehab.

After dragging himself out of the truck, the 25-year-old said he couldn't speak but could not stop smiling.

'I couldn't really talk afterwards, because I was in such shock. I got myself out the truck and I couldn't stop smiling. I'm lucky to come out of there alive.'

He examined the crash scene and it simply did not make sense.

'In my book, one plus one is always going to equal two,' he said. 'I'm looking at this truck and I'm looking at this accident and I'm like, "Dude, one plus one ain't equalling two". Somebody is supposed to be dead.'

'As far as when I'm coming back, who cares? That's not something that I'm worried about right now. I'm just thankful to have breath in my lungs so I can breathe again.'

Newton leaned on the podium for much of his six-minute press conference.

'I feel great,' he said. 'I could be feeling way much worse, as we all know. Me being a religious person, God is good. I'm lucky to be standing in front of you guys.'

The fourth year quarterback will miss the second game of his NFL career with Derek Anderson set to play against Tampa Bay on Sunday.

'As far as when I'm coming back, who cares. That's not something I'm worried about. I'm just thankful to have breath in my lungs so I can breathe again.'
