She caused a stir when she posed on a hay bale in nothing but her underwear 17 years ago.

And it seems model Sophie Anderton, 36, is determined that her recreation of that famous Gossard campaign gets just as much attention.

To this end, she stripped down to her underwear and strutted about in front of her giant billboard today outside the Westfield Shopping Centre in London.

The
model, now 36, looks as good in the flesh as she does in the campaign pictures.

The spectacular set of images marks a return for Sophie as the original Gossard Girl.

The model says she is more comfortable with her body since her first Gossard shoot 17 years ago.

'I am now a woman and not a young girl,' she tells MailOnline.

'So I feel I embrace my body more and I am definitely more confident than I was at 19.

'I couldn't believe when Gossard booked me the first time, it was very surreal. But this time it was like returning home.'

Sophie says she is far more comfortable with her body today than she was when she shot the first campaign, aged 19

Getting back in the barn was easier for Sophie this time around, too.

'Last
time it was shot in the Beverley Hills so I was covered in spiders and 
bugs so that was tricky, especially in front of a crew of 200 people.

'But
this time I knew the photographer and the team and we did trick things a
little by getting some hay into a studio in West London.'

Speaking about the new shoot, Sophie says: 'We had so much fun. It was 
like old friends catching up, just with a bale of hay and in your 
underwear, totally normal!

'I knew when I first wore Glossies they’d be a
classic, and who’d have thought I’d still be getting so much pleasure 
from something so soft!'

Hitting headlines: The original billboards certainly caused a stir, and resulted in Sophie becoming a household name

Phenomenal: Sophie looks in better shape that she did in 1996 when she was just 19 years old

Posing up: Sophie hasn't lost any of her sex appeal, as she proves in the smouldering images

The original campaign saw Sophie literally stop traffic with the billboards, which featured the strapline 'Who said a woman couldn't get pleasure from something soft?'

In the new images recreating that iconic moment, the
reality TV star looks in better shape than ever.

She reveals it's all down to hard work as she practices Bikram Yoga
five times a week and sticks to a diet of fresh, home-cooked organic 
food.

At the age of 36, she 
puts her youthful glow down to using a lot of olive oil in cooking and 
getting regular facials with skin therapist Natalya Robinson.

'I also regular body treatments at Bijoux Medi Spa,' she says.

'My favourite beauty products are Chantecaille vital essence serum.

'I use the jasmine face mask from the same brand, Sarah Chapman products and also C2M gold serum and C2M Crème Delite.'

Speaking about the future, Sophie says: 'I
have been modelling for the last few years abroad and have slowly 
wanted to re-emerge as the woman I am today in the UK.

'We have lots of 
amazing work lined up and I have never been happier than I am now in my 
career. I have an amazing team around me which I never had in the past.

'I
am also DJing around the whole world and I am concentrating on some 
business ventures which are soon to be announced.'

'I
am looking forward to working with Gossard more and am happy my life 
has come full circle. I have never been busier or happier than I am now.'

Sophie reveals she is in a relationship with her partner for 7 months.

'I am really happy but I have learnt to keep things more private,' she says.

A
spokesperson for Gossard added: 'It’s been a pleasure to work with 
Sophie again, she’s a total professional.

'We’ve both passed a few 
landmarks since we were last together, including our 100th birthday, but
as these pictures prove, some things simply improve with age!'

Picture perfect: Sophie revealed that returning and recreating the 'girl in the grass' image was bags of fun

Just chilling out: Sophie has worked hard to maintain her model figure, and the results are clear to see

Other
images from the new campaign include Sophie posing in sexy turquoise 
underwear - one of two new colours Gossard have introduced as part of 
their Glossies collection.

The
company added: 'Glossies have gone from strength to strength and this 
season sees the introduction of two new colours so it seemed only 
fitting to ask Sophie back to unveil them to the world.'

Sophie has enjoyed something of a career revival of late, following her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year.

Since leaving the house, Sophie has 
revealed her true feelings about her former housemates Louie Spence and 
Carol McGiffin, calling them 'vicious two-faced bullying hypocrites'.

In an interview with the Daily Star, 
Sophie said: 'Louie kept on about my looks and claiming I’d had Botox. 
He should look in the mirror. Have you seen his face?

'He
is just a backstabbing b***h who needs to get to the gym and lose 
weight. And Carol is just an alcoholic paralytic old witch.

'She needs a facelift. Her jowls are lower than her knees. Her career will be over after this.'
