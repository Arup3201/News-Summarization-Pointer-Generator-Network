It may not provide that great village shop tradition of a catch up with the latest gossip or a chat about the weather.

But despite the lack of a human touch, this automated shop is a lifeline for residents.

The giant vending machine opened  this week in Clifton, Derbyshire, which has been without a village shop for 14 years.

The machine, which contains chiller 
compartments, stocks essentials such as bread, milk, eggs, toiletries, 
pet food – and umbrellas.

Residents select their items, pay by cash or credit card and take the goods from the dispenser.

Electrical engineer Peter Fox invented it after the village shop closed down. Unable to interest a firm in developing the machine, he spent three years building one himself.

The machine, complete with chiller 
compartments, has a faux red brick front and a traditional awning to 
give the modern shop a traditional feel.

Mr
 Fox says the machines will be introduced to other villages in the area 
in the next few months - claiming they could become a lifeline for small
 communities hit by the rise of internet shopping.

The
 50-year-old father-of-two, from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, said: 'I had 
this idea a few years ago but I couldn’t find a manufacturer who could 
deliver what I wanted, so I rolled up my sleeves and did it myself.

'The result is what essentially amounts to a huge outdoor vending machine - but the term "automatic shop" is actually far more appropriate.

'The problem with vending machines is that they can’t handle the range, weight, or delicacy of a wide range of products such as milk, eggs, bread, washing powder and so on. Our shop can handle all of these and many more besides.'

The shop is fitted with an array of security features including cameras and alarms and will be run by Mr Fox from an industrial unit.

He has also applied for a number of patents for his design.

It works by lifting a small basket up to each shelf before a mechanism pushes out the desired product.

That way it only has a small distance to travel, preventing milk bottles from bursting or eggs from smashing.

Tin of chopped tomatoes £0.65

Six large free-range eggs £1.75

Bottle of fairy liquid £1.29

Tin of Heinz Beans £0.69

Pint of semi-skimmed milk £0.59

Medium sliced loaf of bread £1.45

Small umbrella £2.50

He added: 'I know everything that’s 
happening minute-by-minute and, uniquely, customers can also view all 
our stock, and its availability, live on our website.'

His new company intends to stock each 
machine with local produce where possible, and Peter is already in talks
 with other publicans who are invited to host the machines without 
having to pay a fee.

He said: 'I hope I can put something into the community while developing a truly 21st Century piece of technology.

'It’s hard to compete with the supermarkets on everything, but we can get pretty close, and when you take the travel time and costs into account, we think we can compete, and bring the village shop back to the village.'

Clifton resident Simon Catley, 56, said: 'It’s a magnificent thing.

'The last village store in Clifton closed about 14 years ago, so this is a great addition. Before it was installed you would have to get in your car and drive almost two miles to a Sainsbury’s in Ashbourne even if you just fancied a cup of tea and needed a pint of milk.

'It is also nice to be putting money into a local business rather than a superstore. It stocks everyday essentials, and a little more. You can basically buy everything to make a full English breakfast.'
