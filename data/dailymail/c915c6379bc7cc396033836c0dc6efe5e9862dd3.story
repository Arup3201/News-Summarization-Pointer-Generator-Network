Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable elderly and disabled people who need assistance with day-to-day tasks will receive no help towards the cost of their care, it has emerged.

A group of charities says at least 340,000 people who need home helps for vital jobs such as dressing, washing and cooking will get no support from the Coalition’s reforms to long-term care.

The Care and Support Alliance said that the eligibility criteria for the system are so tight the only ones getting support will be those deemed at risk of ‘abuse or neglect’, or so decrepit that they are just one step away from hospital.

The group, which represents 75 charities such as Age UK and Scope, said the government’s reforms are an improvement on the current system, under which people can lose everything to pay sky-high care bills.

But they say the tight eligibility thresholds of the new regime, which begins in 2016, could mean people will be hit with much higher bills than they might be expecting. They will then be forced to decide between shelling out for care, or doing without it entirely.

The revelation comes a week after the Coalition was accused of betraying pensioners by a Labour peer in the Lords, because a so-called ‘universal’ deferred payments scheme, designed to prevent people from having to sell their home, will not kick in until a person’s other assets have dwindled down to £23,250.

Under the Coalition’s social care plans, people’s care costs will be capped at £72,000 – with the state stepping in to pay the costs after that level has been reached.

But the Alliance points out that the state will only start counting how much people are contributing towards their care once their needs are deemed by an official from the local council to be ‘substantial’.

This means their needs are so bad that they cannot carry out the ‘majority of personal care or domestic routines’, or if ‘abuse or neglect has occurred or will occur’.

Those whose needs are deemed ‘moderate’ – one level down – will not be able to access the government scheme, even though they may still be so dependent that they are unable to cook for themselves or even go to the toilet.

It means that a pensioner could be left with paying thousands of pounds more than the advertised £72,000 level of the cap.

Charities are worried that many with so-called ‘moderate’ needs will simply struggle on without home helps – increasing the chance that they deteriorate further and perhaps also end up in hospital.

Last night Richard Hawkes, chairman of the Care and Support Alliance, praised the Coalition for reforming England’s broken care system – but said the changes did not go far enough.

‘The Care Bill is the first attempt for generations to radically overhaul the creaking system,’ he said. ‘The Government has put forward bold proposals to bring social care into the 21st Century. It’s a real achievement.

‘But it’s becoming clear that a huge number of people that need support will not see any of the benefits of the new system.

'Plans to tightly restrict who gets council care mean more than a quarter of a million people may have to find their own support without any protection from spiralling costs.

‘Ultimately we want the bill to genuinely promote prevention – rather than crisis care.

‘We want the Government to set the bar for who gets and who doesn’t get council support at a level that includes everyone who needs support to live independently.’

At present, it is up to local councils to decide who should benefit from care, with more than 86 per cent setting the level of ‘substantial’ or the higher ‘criticial’.

Ministers want to end this postcode lottery, and will set the national threshold at ‘substantial’, which charities fear could pressurise councils who currently help those with ‘moderate’ needs to stop doing so.

The Care and Support Alliance conducted a new analysis of research conducted by the London School of Economics which found that 340,000 people will receive no support for their care, meaning they will have to pay without their costs being capped.

This includes 170,000 pensioners not currently receiving care but whose needs are ‘moderate’, 65,000 pensioners with moderate needs currently in the system, and 105,000 working-age people with disabilities.

The CSA admitted that helping these extra people would cost £2.8billion extra, but they said that the costs would be recouped because studies show that helping people to stay in their own home reduced expensive hospital admissions  - making it cheaper in the long run.

Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said: 'From 2015, the new national eligibility threshold, together with the £3.8bn of additional funding to support better integration of care, will allow local authorities to maintain access to care and support for those who need it.

'We intend to set the minimum eligibility threshold at a rate equivalent to ‘substantial’, however, this is a minimum level and councils will be able to set a more generous level. This means that local authorities will be able to maintain existing approaches, so that no one has to lose out.

'The vast majority of councils currently set their threshold at ‘substantial’ and the Care Bill means that Councils will not be able to tighten their eligibility criteria beyond this, which sometimes they have done in the past to ease budget pressures. This change will give peace of mind to people. 

'People with lower needs will not be left without support - the Care Bill makes clear that people should still expect tailored information and advice to help them find the care they need, as well as support to access services available locally.'
