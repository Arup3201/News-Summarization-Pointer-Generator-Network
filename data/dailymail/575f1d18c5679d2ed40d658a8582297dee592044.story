Children who have unusual or oddly spelt names tend to fare worse in the classroom, academics have claimed. 

Teachers may subconsciously lower their expectations for pupils with names such as Destiny, Kayleegh and Chantal.

Alternatively, they tend to predict higher grades from students with traditional names - like Catherine or William.

This may suggest that teachers draw conclusions about pupils' backgrounds on the basis of their names, according to The Times Educational Supplement (TES).

Meanwhile, what a child is called could also reflect their parents' backgrounds and achievements. 

James Bruning, Professor of Psychology at Ohio University in America, told the supplement: 'Clearly all of us use stereotypes about all sorts of things, and names are one of those things.

'It is a first impression. If you only have a name as a guide then of course you make assumptions based on that.'

Mr Bruning said that if people were asked which of two students - Wa Wei Lee and Kahine Jefferson - was more likely to better at mathematics, most would opt for the Chinese pupil.

This decision would likely be based on an assumption that children of South-East Asian heritage are better with numbers, he said.

It comes as a study of two million children in Florida found that youngsters with traditional names were more likely to achieve higher grades in their end-of-year tests.

David Figlio, Professor of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University, near Chicago, used a computer programme to analyse the records of siblings with contrasting names.

He discovered that teachers tend to alter their expectations based on pupils' names - with those predicted higher results tending to perform better.

He told the TES: 'Over and over again, teachers hinted at the fact that they draw inferences about kids' backgrounds from things like their names.'

Last year, Apprentice star Katie Hopkins,
 38, sparked controversy by claiming it was acceptable to judge children
 based on their names.

Asked about popular baby names on ITV’s This Morning show, Miss Hopkins criticised ‘lower class’ youngsters with names such as Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and Tyler.

‘I think you can tell a great deal from a name,’ said the mother-of-three.

'For me, a name is a shortcut of finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: “Do I want my children to play with them?”'
