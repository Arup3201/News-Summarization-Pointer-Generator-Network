Hull City have agreed a deal to take Michael Dawson from Tottenham Hotspur.

But Steve Bruce said bringing Jordan Rhodes to the KC Stadium appears ‘further away than ever’.

Dawson would be the third Spurs player to joint Bruce’s team after Jake Livermore and Tom Huddlestone.

The Hull manager said: ‘Michael Dawson we hope we can get. There is a deal in place in principle. Touch wood, we’ll see what develops. It’s taken a long time but it's worth the wait.’

Blackburn have rejected two bids of £8million and £10m for striker Rhodes but it is believed Hull are trying to put together an offer reaching the Championship club’s £12m valuation.

Bruce said: 'I thought I had Jordan Rhodes 24 hours ago and it seems to be even further away than it’s ever been and we’ve been negotiating for a week. We don’t know 100 per cent just yet.

'We’ll see what this week brings and hoe that we can bring in the two three people we’re trying to give the squad a hand. Already we’ve played five competitive games.’
