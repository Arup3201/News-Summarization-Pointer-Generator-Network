The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are ready to establish their own powerbase at Kensington Palace.

Until now, William, Kate and Prince Harry have shared an office with Prince Charles at St James's Palace. But they are about to create their own court in time for Harry's return from Afghanistan in January

More than a dozen staff will begin the switch to the Royal residence in West London next month.

Ready: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will create their court at Kensington Palace

Kate and William, both 30, have a cottage on the site but will soon set up home in Apartment 1A, which used to be occupied by Princess Margaret.

The move is viewed as another sign that William is preparing to leave his role as a search-and-rescue pilot at RAF Anglesey to begin a life of Royal duty with his wife.

'The new set-up will be known as the Household Office of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, and will be transferred from St James's Palace in stages,' said an aide.

'Charles has agreed to fund the private office out of his existing income from the Duchy of Cornwall and has even offered to foot the bill for Kate's not inconsiderable working wardrobe.'

Another source adds: 'The irony is Kensington Palace is where Diana fashioned her powerbase after her divorce from Charles.

'There is no rift with Charles, just a recognition the time has come for the boys and Kate to create their own full identity.'

By next spring, each of the young Royals will have a ­private secretary.

Vicar's daughter Rebecca Deacon will support Kate and former Ministry of Defence press secretary Miguel Head will act for William, while Harry's aide has yet to be appointed.

Helen Asprey will serve as personal private secretary and confidante to all three. The aides will be overseen by long-time Royal gatekeeper Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who will act as principal private secretary and equerry.

The Kensington Palace retinue will include representatives of the trio's charity foundation, security staff and press secretaries, such as Kate and William's new media guru Ed Perkins.

The office will also house admin staff who will manage the rising number of public engagements undertaken by the three Royals.

After years of acting like a thug, former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson wants to become a serious actor.

Tyson, 46, recently finished a one-man
Broadway show, The Undisputed Truth, and a pal said: 'Mike is now 
taking acting lessons and reading Shakespeare and biographies on Sir 
Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud.'

The source added: 'He honestly believes he could become the next Denzel Washington.'

Andrew Parker Bowles, the former husband of the Duchess of Cornwall, is stepping out with Rosalind, Lady Morrison – once a close friend of Prince Charles.

Andrew, 72, is a frequent visitor to the 66-year-old's home in the grounds of Madresfield Court, the stately home near Malvern that inspired Evelyn Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited.

'They've been discreetly courting for six months and are smitten,' says a chum.
