A generation of genetically-modified 'X-Men' superhumans could be among us by 2045, a Ministry of Defence think tank has said.

Advancements in gene technology could help humans gain mutant powers such as the likes of Wolverine, Cyclops and Storm in the popular comic book and movie series, it has been reported.

The MoD's Development Concepts and Doctrine Centre warn however that 'genetic inequality' could result from advancements in biology being unequally shared across society.

Mutant: MoD experts have suggested  a generation of genetically-modified 'X-Men' superhumans, such as Wolverine, could be a reality by 2045

The centre met last summer for a two-day summit, featuring experts from government, industry and universities. The details have been released following a Freedom of Information request by The Sun.

It was reported during the summit, held to predict what would happen in the future, that: 'Advancements in gene technology could lead to a class of genetically superior humans by 2045.

'Human augmentation is likely to increase over the next 30 years.

'Discussions highlighted that it is possible that advances in biology, unequally shared across society, could generate genetic inequality.'

The X-Men are a team of mutant superheroes created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, who first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1963.

The mutants use their powers for the benefit of humanity, despite an ever-growing anti-mutant sentiment among mankind.

The comics were turned into a highly-succesful film series, featuring Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm, Ian McKellan as Magneto and Patrick Stewart as Professor X.

Telepathic: Professor X, played by Patrick Stewart in the films, is known as the leader and founder of the X-Men and is able to read, control, and influence human minds
