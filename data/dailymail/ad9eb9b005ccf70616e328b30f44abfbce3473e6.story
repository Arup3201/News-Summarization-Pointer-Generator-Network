A lawyer for James 'Whitey' Bulger has identified the federal official who he says gave the Boston mobster immunity to commit crimes while he was an FBI informant.

In court papers filed on Wednesday, former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Jeremiah O'Sullivan was named as having granted Bulger immunity for past or future crimes.

Bulger's
lawyers said the judge in his case has a conflict of interest because he worked in the U.S. attorney's office in Boston at the same time as 
O'Sullivan, who died in 2009.

The revelation was made in a defense motion from attorney J.W. Carney for Judge Richard Stearns to recuse himself.

Prosecutors have said Bulger never received immunity from anyone. The 83-year-old Bulger is accused of participating in 19 murders and is currently awaiting trial.

Bulger has pleaded not guilty to 
charges linked to the murders in the 1970s and 1980s, when prosecutors 
say he ran the mostly Irish-American gang.

He fled Boston in 1994 and remained one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives until his capture in California last year along with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig.

Greig and Bulger, 82, were arrested on June 22, 2011, in an apartment hideout in Santa Monica, California, blocks from the Pacific Ocean, where they had lived under a number of fake and stolen identities for most of their years on the run.

A cache of some 30 weapons as well as more than $800,000 in cash was hidden in a hole in the wall.

Bulger, the former leader of the Winter Hill Gang, was also an FBI informant.

His girlfriend Ms Greig, 61, was sentenced to eight years in March after being charged with conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, conspiracy to commit identity fraud, and identity fraud.

Prosecutors had sought 10 years in prison while her attorney had recommended 27 months.

The
accused mob boss fled Boston in 1994 after getting a tip from a corrupt
FBI agent that authorities were closing in on him. Greig joined Bulger a
few weeks later.

Bulger's
trial is scheduled to start on November 5 although his lawyers have 
said they need more time to sift through hundreds of thousands of pages 
of evidence.

Bulger's case inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film 'The Departed.'

Bulger got his start in crime robbing banks and when he ended up in prison for nine years, he studied military tactics and strategies, according toÂ Massachusetts police officer Thomas Foley who chronicled his decades' long hunt for Bulger in his book Most Wanted.

Bulger was able to evade capture for almost 50 years thanks to the help of the FBI, according to Mr Foley.

Bulger would tip off the agency on rivals in exchange for not being arrested, despite a $2 million tag on his head.

John Connolly, one of the FBI agents who helped Bulger, is now serving a forty-year prison sentence.
