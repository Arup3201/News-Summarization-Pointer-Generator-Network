Andre Agassi smashed his prized Wimbledon cup and every tennis trophy he had in a jealous rage after watching his then girlfriend Brooke Shields film a scene for Friends.

The 'Blue Lagoon' beauty was in the middle of filming one of the most popular episodes of the show when Mr Agassi stormed off the set.

He had been watching on the sound stage as guest star Shields licked the fingers of Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc, and threw her head back with maniacal laughter.

But the tennis champion told his then girlfriend she had 'made him look a fool' in the scene with actor Matt Leblanc.

Ms Shields wrote that her beau got in his car in Los Angeles and drove all the way home to Las Vegas.

'Upon arrival he systematically smashed and destroyed every single trophy he had won, including Wimbledon and the US Open, never mind all the others, ' she added, according to Globe magazine in the US.

In her memoir, 'There Was A Little Girl: The Real Story of Mother and Me,' Shields says it took her three years to have all the trophies replaced after the 1995 incident.

Agassi, now 44, won the Wimbledon singles title in 1992 and went on to claim four Australian titles, two US Opens and the French Open in a glittering 20-year career.

Despite the flashpoint, the former child star and the tennis champion wed in April 1997. 

It would be another two years before they divorced just shy of their second wedding anniversary but Shields wrote that it didn't take her long to wish she'd never gone through with the ceremony.

The day after the wedding in Big Sur, California, she realised she had made a 'mistake.'

'I could not form a sentence. I kept shaking my head as if I had duct tape across my mouth. It hit me all of a sudden - I knew I had made a mistake. I did not want to be married…I wanted to be a bride but I shouldn't have been married yet,' she wrote.

The couple were busy working apart for much of their marriage and Shields said the relationship was 'just existing.'

Later, she wrote that Agassi had broken down and told her 'that for the whole first part of our relationship he had been addicted to crystal meth.

'I was shocked but immediately got hurt and insulted that he had not come to me at the time.'

Despite the argument, the former child star and the tennis champion married in April 1997 - the day after, she says, she realised she had made a 'mistake'

She added: 'I feared our life together was not based in absolute truth.'

A candid autobiography written by Agassi also suggests the lavish wedding to the actress was a mistake.

From the four helicopters full of paparazzi circling overhead to the groom wearing  elevator shoes to avoid being dwarfed by his towering bride, the celebration is rendered in 'Open' as a bleak farce.

'I have a thought no man should have on his wedding day: I wish I were leaving too. I wish I had a decoy groom to take my place,' he revealed in his autobiography.

Soon after his divorce in 1999, Mr Agassi began wooing Steffi Graf, another former tennis prodigy, who, Agassi says, loathed the game as much as he did but surpassed him in disciplined, competitive fury.

Speaking 14 years after the break-up, Shields revealed that the tennis star had told her it was fortunate they did not have children.

She said: 'I am divorced. And mine was very quick and relatively easy but it's a very interesting thing because he - quote, unquote - did say to me, 'Be happy that we don't have children or I would not have made this easy for you.''

She added with a laugh, 'And therein lies why I'm not there anymore.' 

The former 'Suddenly Susan' sitcom star briefly dated John Travolta, Liam Neeson, JFK Jr. and was close friends with Michael Jackson.

Shields also wrote about her platonic fling with gay Wham! singer George Michael, saying her mother Teri helped set them up on a date.

After a romantic hotel dinner in Chicago she said the star walked her to her room. 'He left without even trying to kiss me. I was so touched by what a real gentleman he was (I wanted to yell, 'Wait, please don't go go!'

After going on a couple more dates and shopping trips, Ms Shields wrote that she was 'devastated' when Mr Michael dumped her, saying, 'I think we need to take a break. I need to concentrate on my career.'

She added she cried herself to sleep 'for weeks.'

Shields, now 49 , remarried in 2001 to TV writer Chris Henchy and they have two daughters, Rowan 10, and Grier, seven.

In the memoir, published on November 18, she also discusses her mother's lifelong battle with drinking and the public misconception that she forced her daughter into projects she didn't want to do. 

The actress was at her mother's side when she died in October 2012 after a decline into dementia.
