A widow has told an inquest how she 'screamed' in vain for hours after her husband hit his head and disappeared from their boat as they were passing through a pitch black canal tunnel.

Susan Holgate desperately tried to raise the alarm to save her husband Michael, but no-one heard her cries for help from the Harecastle Tunnel in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. 

The mother-of-four also frantically sounded the vessel’s horn to draw attention to the tragedy, but it was two hours before canal workers reached the stricken vessel - and a further eight hours before the 58-year-old’s body was pulled from the cold, murky waters of the Trent and Mersey Canal.

Now a coroner has called for safety improvements at the tunnel after hearing chilling details of the tragedy in May this year.

The couple, who previously ran a guest house in Windermere, Cumbria, had retired to live on their narrowboat last summer.

Mr Holgate was described as an 'experienced boat handler' and the couple, who had been married for 32 years, had planned to spend the rest of their lives together travelling Britain’s waterways.

The inquest in Stoke-on-Trent heard the boat was passing through Harecastle Tunnel near Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, on May 20 as the couple made their way to a family wedding.

Mr Holgate of Ambleside, Cumbria, had been driving the narrowboat while his wife and their 44-year-old son Anthony sat at the front.

But inside the cramped unlit 2,500-metre tunnel the retired bus driver is believed to have banged his head and fallen into the canal.

His desperate wife tried in vain in pitch black conditions to locate him, but after over two hours she had to get out and raise the alarm.

Mrs Holgate told the hearing: 'We went two-thirds of the way without any problem. I was first aware there was a problem when the boat hit the side.

'I shouted out and there was no reply. I got to the back and he wasn’t there.

'It was horrendous. I just shouted and screamed.

'I would hate for someone to go through what I went through.'

The fatal accident happened after the couple had travelled around the UK and were making their way north to attend his brother’s wedding in Macclesfield, Cheshire.

North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith concluded the death was accidental.

He said: 'Somehow or another, he caught his head on the roof or side of the tunnel and from there, he’s gone into the water.

'He may have struck his head again on the boat or side of the tunnel or the propeller as it went past him. We don’t know. There would be a degree of shock as the water was cold. I would like to think his death was mercifully quick.'

Mr Smith said he would write to The Canal and River Trust to ask for lines of communication to be installed and that advice be given to passengers to wear a safety jacket when entering the tunnel.

He added: 'There is a cost but what is the cost of Michael Holgate’s life?

'I don’t want to see people go on these narrow boats without life jackets. It defies logic.'
