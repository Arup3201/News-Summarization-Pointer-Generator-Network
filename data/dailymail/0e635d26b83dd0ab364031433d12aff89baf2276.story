Architect Oscar Niemeyer who recreated Brazil's sensuous curves in reinforced concrete and built the capital of Brasilia on the empty central plains as a symbol of the nation's future has died at the age of 104.

Elisa Barboux, a spokeswoman for the Hospital Samaritano in Rio de Janeiro, said Niemeyer died from a respiratory infection.

He had been in hospital for several weeks and also on separate occasions earlier this year suffering from kidney problems, pneumonia and dehydration.

Dr Fernando Gjorup, Niemeyer's 
physician, said the architect worked on pending projects in the days 
before his death, taking visits from engineers and other professionals.

'The
most impressive thing is that his body suffered, but his mind was 
lucid,' Dr Gjorup said. 'He didn't talk about death, never talked about 
death. He talked about life.'

In
works from Brasilia's crown-shaped cathedral to the undulating French 
Communist Party building in Paris, Niemeyer shunned the steel-box 
structures of many modernist architects, finding inspiration in nature's
crescents and spirals.

His 
hallmarks include much of the United Nations complex in New York and the
Museum of Modern Art in Niteroi, which is perched like a flying saucer 
across Guanabara Bay from Rio de Janeiro.

'Right
angles don't attract me. Nor straight, hard and inflexible lines 
created by man,' he wrote in his 1998 memoir The Curves Of Time. 'What 
attracts me are free and sensual curves. The curves we find in 
mountains, in the waves of the sea, in the body of the woman we love.'

His curves give sweep and grace to 
Brasilia, the city that opened up Brazil's vast interior in the 1960s 
and moved the nation's capital from coastal Rio.

Niemeyer
designed most of the city's important buildings, while French-born, 
avant-garde architect Lucio Costa crafted its distinctive plane-like 
layout.

Niemeyer left his mark in the flowing concrete of the cabinet ministries and the monumental dome of the national museum.

As
the city grew to two million, critics said it lacked 'soul' as well as 
street corners, 'a utopian horror', in the words of art critic Robert 
Hughes.

But Niemeyer 
shrugged off the criticism. 'If you go to Brasilia you might not like 
it, say there's something better, but there's nothing just like it,' he 
said in an interview with O Globo newspaper in 2006 at the age of 98.

'I search for surprise in my architecture. A work of art should cause the emotion of newness.'

Even late in life, Niemeyer was 
striving for renewal. In 2009, he came under heavy criticism for 
proposing to build a 'Plaza of Sovereignty' in the heart of Brasilia.

Preservationists
said the 330ft obelisk he envisaged would mar the very skyline the 
architect created half a century earlier. Niemeyer relented on the 
plaza, only to unveil new plans for a 165ft tower in the same spot.

Living
well past the century mark, Niemeyer's journey mirrored that of his 
beloved Brazil, and his restless modernism captured the developing 
country's sweeping ambitions.

With
hundreds of his buildings dotting the landscape, arguably no other 
architect shared as tight a bond with a country as Niemeyer did with 
Brazil.

Oscar Niemeyer 
Soares Filho was born on December 15 1907, in Rio de Janeiro, and earned
his architecture degree at Rio's School of Fine Arts.

Working
in Costa's office in 1936, he helped design a Rio education ministry 
building that was a classic of functionalist horizontal and vertical 
lines.

With modernist 
giant Le Corbusier, Niemeyer developed the 'brise soleil', a heat 
protector that enhanced the building's grid design and became an 
architectural standard in the 1960s.

Niemeyer teamed up again with Le Corbusier in 1947 to design much of the United Nations complex in New York. After months of squabbling with architects - most notably Le Corbusier - Niemeyer came up with the final plan for the complex, including the Secretariat, General Assembly and conference buildings and the Dag Hammarskjold Library.

But Niemeyer already was chafing at the limits of form-follows-function architecture.

His first solo project was the Pampulha complex of buildings set on an artificial lake in the central Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, now Brazil's third-largest metro area. For the first time, Niemeyer employed the curves and arches that would become his hallmark.

In the 1950s, Niemeyer was summoned by President Juscelino Kubitschek to design a new capital on Brazil's empty central high plains. Costa became the project's urban planner.

With the slogan of '50 years in five', Mr Kubitschek hoped to prod Brazil into a great leap forward - and inward, away from the coast.

Niemeyer rose to the challenge, testing new forms and technical limits for reinforced concrete. His cone-shaped Metropolitan Cathedral is a circle of curved concrete pillars set like tepee poles with glass mosaic in between.

'I didn't want an old-style cathedral - dark, a reminder of sin,' he said in an interview in the 1990s. 'I wanted something happier.'

After a 1964 coup plunged Brazil into a 21-year military dictatorship, Niemeyer, a lifelong communist, decided to spend more time in Europe. While living in France in 1965, he designed the headquarters of the French Communist Party.

During the dictatorship he also designed the centre of the Mondadori publishing house in Italy, Constantine University in Algeria and other projects in Israel, Lebanon, Germany and Portugal.
