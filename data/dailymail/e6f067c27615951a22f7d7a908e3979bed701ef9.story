A 15-year-old schoolboy  who packed a knife in his lunchbox was locked up for seven  years  yesterday for killing an older teenager who had been annoying him.

Jordan Shaw stabbed Joey Smith, 18, through the heart after they were seen pushing each other ‘like stags’ in the street.

He had earlier boasted of his intention to ‘stab a lad who was p***ing him off’ and had been picking on him, Sheffield Crown Court was told.

The judge described Shaw, who has a 
history of violence, as ‘utterly reckless’, giving him a ten-year 
‘extended’ sentence of which he will serve seven years in detention and 
the rest on licence.

The teenager was cleared of  murder by a jury and convicted of manslaughter after a two-week trial.

Judge Alan Goldsack ordered that the 
under-age defendant should no longer enjoy the protection of anonymity 
and said he posed a ‘significant risk of causing serious harm’ by 
committing further offences.

The judge said: ‘More and more people
are carrying knives in public and using them to cause injury or death.
And it is among young people that the carrying  and use of knives 
appears to be most prevalent.

‘The message has to be reinforced 
every time that a death occurs from the use of a knife that punishment 
and deterrents to protect the  public are the prime purposes of 
sentencing, whatever the age of  the accused.’

Shaw’s victim had a young daughter 
and his girlfriend was pregnant with their second child at the time of 
his death. The court heard that Shaw had two run-ins with Mr Smith on 
the fateful day and initially packed a knife in his lunchbox on the way 
to classes before ditching it.

He later armed himself with a second knife, which he took from the kitchen at home, in order to  stab Mr Smith.

Prosecutor Michelle Colborne QC said Shaw talked about his intention to launch a knife attack.

She said: ‘He was going to give him a
couple of stabs in the leg.  He wanted to show him who was who.’ Mr 
Smith, who was unemployed, died in the village of Moorends, near 
Doncaster, on March 23 this year. The pair both lived in the village.

Shaw accepted he stabbed Mr Smith during an altercation in the street after school, but claimed it was an accident.

The prosecution said Mr Smith had told friends he was going to attack – or ‘bang’ – the 15-year-old.

‘He said he had some trouble with a 
lad who wanted to fight with  him, but he didn’t appear to be fazed by 
this,’ said Miss Colborne.

When the pair encountered each other,
they began arguing and Mr Smith ran at Shaw and swung  a punch. Shaw, 
who had the knife up his sleeve, retaliated and began  shouting at his 
rival before stabbing him twice.

Shaw then threw his arms up in triumph and ran away, leaving his rival to die ‘a very speedy death’.

The weapon was later recovered from a
drain with the victim’s blood on it. When arrested, Shaw, who is now 
16, told police Mr Smith had pushed him and he just reacted with a knife
he had found earlier that day, which he later admitted was a lie.

Shaw had been permanently excluded 
from school for fighting and had a conviction at 13 for assault when he 
kicked a boy on the ground.

He has also had a reprimand  for threatening behaviour and a warning for anti-social behaviour.

After the trial, Detective Chief 
Inspector Matt Fenwick of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This case has 
greatly affected the community of Moorends, where both Joseph Smith and 
Jordan Shaw are from.

‘The two young men were out in Moorends with their friends on  the evening when Joseph was attacked.’

The victim’s parents, Betsy and 
Charles Smith, said: ‘The day we lost Joey was the saddest day of our 
lives. Six months later, you  can almost touch the grief in the family 
home.

‘He had the rest of his life ahead of him and two beautiful children to watch grow up.

‘No one will ever know what went 
through one boy’s mind as he  took the life of another, and whatever 
happens it will never bring Joey back.’
