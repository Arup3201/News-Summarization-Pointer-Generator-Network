A 19-year-old college student announced for the first time Thursday that she was an undocumented immigrant while addressing Hillary Clinton at an event in New York City.

Nova Bajamonti was picked to ask the former Secretary of State a question at a 'No Ceilings' event at the Lower Eastside Girls Club on Thursday.

'For the first time publicly, I want to say that I am an undocumented immigrant,' Ms Bajamonti said before tearing up.

Hiding no more: 19-year-old college student Nova Bajamonti came out Thursday as an undocumented immigrant at an event with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, moderated by actress America Ferrera

Her own glass ceiling: The 19-year-old says she moved to the country when she was just five years old from Split, Serbia and that her citizenship status has made it impossible to get a job or even a loan to attend her dream college. Pictured above in a photo posted on her Facebook

The unexpected announcement took many in the audience by surprise, but the brave teen was quickly showered in applause.

She went on to explain that she moved to the United States when she was just 5 years old from Split, Serbia and that her status as an illegal immigrant keeps her from achieving many of her dreams.

'I don't have the documentation I need to get a job, to vote, which is essential to women's representation, to buy an apartment, to take out a loan to go to college, so I couldn't even go to my dream college because of that,' she said. According to her Facebook profile, Ms Bajamonti attends Brooklyn College.

That's when she turned the conversation towards Clinton, asking her what can be done to help her situation.

'What do we need to do to put this in priority when it comes to Congress, because this is an extreme glass ceiling to me that I can't even control?' Ms Bajamonti asked.

The former first lady and presidential hopeful, then took the microphone and praised Ms Bajamonti for her act of courage.

'That was incredibly brave, and I thank you for doing that because it is important to put ourselves in other peopleâ€™s shoes,' Clinton said.

Clinton went on to explain that she supports immigration reform and that she believes the U.S. should do more to welcome people like Ms Bajamonti 'and 11 million others who have made contributions to our country'.

'I am a huge supporter of immigration reform and a path to citizenship and will continue to advocate for that,' Clinton said.

'I'm pregnant': Clinton's daughter Chelsea also attended the event and made a shocking announcement of her own

Clinton's daughter Chelsea was at the event moderated by actress America Ferrera as well, and Bajamonti's announcement came just before Chelsea shared shocking news of her own: that she's pregnant.

At the end of the event, Chelsea said that she and husband Marc are expecting their first child later this year.

'And I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in a world full of so many strong, young female leaders,' Chelsea said. 'So thank you for inspiring me and thank you for inspiring future generations.'
