2013 may well have been the year of Cara Delevingne, but 2014 looks set to be her best friend Suki Waterhouse's time to shine.

The 22-year-old model - and gorgeous girlfriend of Bradley Cooper - has been unveiled as the new face of Burberry's fragrance, Brit Rhythm for women.

The British model and actress is the ultimate rock chick in studded leathers and heavy eyeliner as she stars alongside British musician George Barnett of These New Puritans in the sultry black and white shoot.

The new fragrance aims to combine powerful femininity with a rock and roll edge, bringing together classic and unexpected notes in a new powdery floral fragrance.

Music is at the heart of Burberry activity globally, from shows, events and soundtracks to the brand's music platform devoted to emerging talent, Burberry Acoustic - they brand were famous for helping Jake Bugg and Tom Odell hit the mainstream - and the fragrance aims to reflect that.

'The Brit Rhythm fragrances build on the anticipation, energy and adrenaline of live music performances and connect physical and digital audiences globally,' said a spokesperson for the brand.

A capsule of Brit ready-to-wear and accessories, centered around the iconic leather jacket worn by Suki in the campaign, celebrates the fragrance launch.

Suki is no stranger to high-end fashion campaigns and began her modelling career after being discovered in a pub in London at the tender age of 16.

Getting in the role: Suki, who was scouted in a pub when she was 16, has been a friend of the brand for years and regularly occupies the front row at their shows

Touch up: Burberry has also released a signature make-up look in collaboration with the launch, which Suki masters

Her first major campaign was for M&S lingerie aged 19 and she has since modelled for the likes of  alice + olivia, H&M, Pepe Jeans and Coast.

As well as a successful career, Suki is also having some luck in her love life.

She has been dating Hollywood heartthrob Bradley Cooper for a year now - and it seems they are closer than ever.

After
 snuggling at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and strolling 
hand-in-hand around Sundance this month, the pair piled on the PDA once 
again last week.

The couple were seen sharing a kiss after watching the Justin Timberlake concert in Inglewood, California.
