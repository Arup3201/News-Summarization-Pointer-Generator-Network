Sixth-formers taking their A-levels will now be able to study the culture of 'selfies'.

Students who choose to study sociology will now cover topics such as social media, online safety and privacy as part of a new course, approved by England's exams regulator Ofqual.

The qualification has been drawn up by exam board OCR, which argues that the subject should not be seen as a 'soft option'.

The new A-Level is available from September 2015 and students will look at online safety and privacy

It said that it will 
include looking at 'evidence-based research on globalisation', such as 
studies on why many young people claim they could not live without the 
internet and how men and women behave differently online.

Victoria 
Hunter, OCR subject team manager, said: 'We have brought our syllabus 
bang up to date with exciting new content that tackles some of the 
biggest issues facing societies today.

'Globalisation and digital communication are transforming work, family and leisure life.

'No
 sociology A-level would be complete without making it compulsory to 
study how people are responding to the new rules of the digital global 
village.'

She
 added: 'Students will apply sociological theories and methods to 
explore weighty questions around online censorship, how to police the 
rising tide of global organised crime, if the selfie culture encourages 
sexualisation of young girls, whether social networks unite or isolate 
people and the role of digital networks in creating virtual 
communities'.

The new A-level, which will be available from September 2015, is split into three parts.

The first looks at core sociological themes such as socialisation, culture, identity and power, and the second looks at research methods, including data analysis taking into account inequality, class, gender, ethnicity and age.

The third focuses on 'globalisation', allowing students to explore different methods of social enquiry and develop their understanding of social processes, change and policy.

The exam board stated: 'With more than 1.3 billion people on 
Facebook, over a million selfies posted each day and more people 
worldwide having access to a mobile phone (six billion) than to a 
working toilet (4.5 billion), students will analyse how societies manage
 the positive and negative impacts of, for example, freedom of 
information, privacy, online safety, equality of access to technology 
and gender stereotyping'.

According to OCR just over 30,000 candidates take A-level sociology and 50,000 take an AS-level in the subject, while around 7,000 people graduate from university with a sociology degree every year.
