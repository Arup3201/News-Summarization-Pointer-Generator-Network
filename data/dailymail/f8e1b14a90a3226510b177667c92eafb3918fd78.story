Gay Professor Jeff Frank claimed he was underpaid and victimised at his university

An eminent gay professor has claimed that he was victimised at his university after flagging up pay inequality among his male and female colleagues.

Professor Jefferson Frank claimed at an employment tribunal today that he received a lower rating than less experienced and less published co-workers, despite founding the department and serving as its head.

The American-born financial expert, who is openly gay, also fears he is being mistreated because two years ago he sued Royal Holloway College for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and for being a trade union member.

The university college, in Egham, Surrey, settled that case with him out of court but the academic feels the victimisation has continued.

Royal Holloway College was contesting the case at today's employment tribunal.

The professor, who first went to the college in 1994, said in his statement to the tribunal: 'Professor Clare Bradley, a professor of psychology, approached me concerning my research of equalities in the academic profession - a subject in which I’m viewed as an international expert.

'She had become concerned about practices where a male academic had been proposed for promotion because he had a ‘wife and child’ to support.

'She was seeking to form a working group that would develop guidelines for non-discriminatory practices.'

The professor is a leading economist at Royal Holloway and has previously taught at several Ivy League universities

Royal Holloway Principal Paul Layzell is said to have had a meeting with Frank last January. Frank claimed the principal said one of them would have to leave the college if the grievances continued

As a result of their work an equal pay audit was carried out which uncovered an 11 per cent gender pay gap and 'unsatisfactory professorial pay determination processes.'

Professor Frank said the research had personal consequences for him.

'Since I had stopped getting pay rises once I started (in 2006) publishing on sexual orientation on pay and promotions in British universities, I filed a grievance.

'I subsequently filed a sexual orientation discrimination case when my grievance wasn’t heard in a reasonable time.'

He explained growing difficulties he experienced over the following years with his line manager and the Dean of his department, Professor Rosemary Deem, and with the then director of human resources, John Grimmer.

The situation spread into the university’s 'banding' assessments, through which staff are graded and salaries are arranged.

When Professor Frank got a lower grading than he expected he appealed and his pressure eventually led to outside experts being brought in to conduct their own assessment.

'I was perhaps the only professor at the college who had been invited to be visiting professor at the most prestigious international universities, Harvard University and the University of California (Berkeley).

'I had founded one of the largest and most successful departments at the college, again an accomplishment that makes me unique at the college.

'This was a record of contribution that certainly ranked high and reflected my now 18 years of experience at professorial level.'

He said respected economist Alistair Ulph’s finding was that the professor should have had a higher banding, yet the college still maintained its position.

In January 2011 he filed his latest grievance.

'I did this because I couldn’t conceive of how a 2+ banding could have been given to me without it being either sexual orientation discrimination or victimisation for my employment tribunal case, for my testifying in the equal pay case and for my serving as a union officer.

He said he had a meeting on January 21 last year with the principal, Paul Layzell, after which he claimed he was told: 'If these grievances and all continue, one or other of us is going to have to leave the college.'

Professor Frank is still employed by the Surrey-based and commutes from Roupell Street in south London where one house is currently selling for close to a million pound.

He told the tribunal panel, in Reading, Berkshire: 'It is worth noting that despite the victimisation I have suffered throughout the last two years, I have put in an immense amount of effort on behalf of the college, successfully leading the department in a rebuilding phase.

'The department’s PhD programme and MSc programmes have doubled in size, with undergraduate enrollment growing by 50 students per year.

'Particularly in light of all this effort I have been putting in for the college, the victimisation has been very hurtful to me.

'At each juncture the college found excuses not to raise my banding.

'In addition I was discriminated against and victimised by being asked to step down prematurely as head of department and to have my post as professor threatened if I continue with my grievance.'

The hearing, before Employment Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto, is expected to last five days.
