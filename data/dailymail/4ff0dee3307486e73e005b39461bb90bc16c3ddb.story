Levi-Blu collapsed in the early hours of Wednesday at his home in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham

The parents of an 18-month-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of his murder.

Levi-Blu collapsed in the early hours of Wednesday at his home in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham.

Paramedics took the child to hospital after they were called to the address at 4.53am.

Police initially arrested Levi's parents - Danielle Cassin, 25, and 29-year-old Marcus Piper - on charges of wilful neglect.

But on Friday the pair were re-arrested on suspicion of the toddler's murder.

They have since been released on bail while police carry out their investigation.

The boy's grandmother Angela Cassin, 46, was too upset to talk from her home, saying: 'It's all too raw at the moment - we can't get our heads around what is going on.'

But in a Facebook post on Friday she wrote: 'it is with the greatest sadness that i write this....our special baby levi died of internal injuries and it is being classed as murder ...HEARTBROKEN.'

Daughter Danielle replied in a lengthy post: 'I lost my baby and have been carted off like a criminal I cant grieve my heart is broken he was my baby and nobody wants justice more than me.'

Touching floral tributes were also left at the parent's one -bedroomed flat yesterday afternoon.

One read: 'RIP baby boy, sleep tight now never gonna be forgotten. All our love always and forever. Sophie and Bobby xxxxx'.

While another poignantly said: 'Gone but never forgotten. Always in our heart and thoughts.'

Neighbour Jenny Jones, 21, added: "She seemed to adore that child and I can't imagine she would ever want to hurt him. Everybody around her is just shocked to the very core."

A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed they had launched a murder probe into the death.

'We were called by the ambulance service to an address in Nightingale Avenue at Castle Bromwich just before 5am on Wednesday, February 20, following a report of a child who had collapsed,' said the spokesman.

'The child, a boy aged 18 months, was treated by the ambulance service but unfortunately died.

Neighbours were last night deeply shocked by the news, and a memorial page of Facebook was flooded with messages

'The death is being treated as 
suspicious.

In a lengthy Facebook post, which had little punctuation, Daniele Cassin wrote: 'I lost my baby and have been carted off like a criminal i cant grieve my heart is broken he was my baby and nobody wants justice more than me

'yes i was arrested i woke up at 5 oclock in the morning to find my baby dead and dont no what happened to him but i will fight to find out

'i love that boy with all my heart and anybody who knows us know that he was my life and he has been snatched from me anyone who thinks any different obviously does not no me i miss my baby sooo much and its bad enough being carted away and not being able to take him a teddy because he shouldnt be alone

'people are acting like i done something wrong i did everything as a mother i could i didnt no there was anything wrong with him otherwise i would of sought him help as far as i knew he was just sick

'i took the cover he got sick on to my moms to check it was ok because i love my son and anyone who doubts me will not be welcome to my sons funeral

'my son knows his mommy loves him and would never hurt him its killing me and as i was a good mother it will be me making funeral decisions

'of course i am open to ideas from my family and my mom it will be me who will make the desicions for the last thing i get to do for my beautiful angel so people need to show some respect and realise i lost MY baby xxx'

'Two people were initially arrested on Wednesday on suspicion
of wilful neglect, a 25-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man. Both were
subsequently arrested on Friday on suspicion of murder.

'The pair have 
since been released on police bail, pending further enquiries.'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed that they had dealt with the tragedy.

'We can confirm we were called to the address at 4.53am on Wednesday,' he said.

'A paramedic area support officer in a rapid response vehicle and an ambulance crew attended.

'An 18-month-old child was taken to hospital.'

The death of the youngster has shocked his community.

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everybody is shocked. Round here, it is a very close-knit community.

'Little Levi should never have died. It's wrong. Everyone is so angry.

'He lived with his parents. I don't think they have any other children.'

A police spokesman said the force could not comment on any previous contact with the family.

Last night a Facebook memorial page to Levi had already received hundreds of tributes to the youngster.

One, from Lorraine Dobson, reads: 'God bless this poor little mite. He never harmed a hair on anyone's head. So innocent. May the angels guide you and protect you. Always in our thoughts. Sleep tight xxxx.

A third, from Sophie Willis, reads: 'RIP little man, was only last summer me and auntie Nikki took you and Harvey out for the day. Too precious for this world and now a beautiful angel. Sleep easy little man xx.'
