He may be less of an influence on the pitch than in previous years, but Didier Drogba is determined to do his bit to help his Chelsea win the Premier League.

The Ivorian striker has only scored three league goals since returning to the club, but insists his role is as much about mentoring the younger members of the squad. 

Drogba re-joined Chelsea, where he scored 100 league goals in his first spell, to offer a calming presence, and the forward says his role is about helping others to take the lead on the pitch.

'They're going to be there,' he said of Jose Mourinho's young core. 'We won't be any more  so it is up to us to give them all they need and pass it on to the younger players as well.

'It's important for us, the older players, to be there to support them, but at the same time it's even more important for them to take the lead now, to feel there is no restriction from us.

'They can play, they can talk, we can debate and exchange because all we're doing now is for the team - to be better next year, in two years and five.'

However, Drogba also pointed out the benefit of keeping older stars like John Terry around, after the Chelsea captain signed a new contract.

'It's logical when you see the way he's performed this year and the way the manager is happy with him,' added Drogba.

'You can see he has the desire to carry on playing and being the best defender. It's deserved and I'm really happy for him.'
