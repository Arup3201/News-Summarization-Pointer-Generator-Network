A dog breeder who claimed almost £17,000 in benefits claiming she had difficult walking was caught when investigators filmed her jogging with her prized Collies in a show ring.

Susan Malpas conned the taxpayer out of thousands in disability living allowance over six years - even saying she needed help leaving her house.

But undercover fraud investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) filmed the 62-year-old parading her Collie at a dog show on August 31 last year.

The 43-second video shows Malpas - who is wearing cream trousers, a red t-shirt and a brown jacket - jogging around the arena at the Canine Show at Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire in front of an audience.

Incredibly, despite telling the DWP she was unable to walk very far and had poor mobility, the footage shows her jogging for three laps of the show ring.

Malpas, of Willenhall in the West Midlands, admitted falsely claiming the benefits when she was interviewed by investigators.

And she pleaded guilty to an offence of failing to notify of a change of circumstances between May 16, 2007 and October 29, 2013 with a view to obtain payment of benefit at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday.

The charge also included failing to promptly notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in circumstances namely that her physical capabilities had improved and that she knew that this would affect her entitlement to claim disability living allowance.

Judge Philip Parker adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.

Malpas, who falsely claimed and received £16,826 she was not entitled to, was granted unconditional bail and will be sentenced on August 8.

After the hearing, Sian Fellowes, DWP Fraud Manager in the West Midlands, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.

'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. Don't wait for fraud investigators to find you.'

On her website - called Lanlin Rough Collies - Malpas boasts about the 'good time' she has had breeding dogs and appearing at shows.

The site includes pictures of numerous dogs she has bred and even has pictures of her at Crufts.

There is also a picture of Malpas with a dog which she says won best puppy in breed at the Collie Association Open Show in June this year.

On the site, Malpas writes: 'Following my decree absolute, they gave me the strength to carry on and what a good time I have had.'

An entry on her behalf on a dog breeding directory adds: 'I have been breeding and exhibiting Rough Collies since 1979.

'I am a member of most of the Rough Collie Breed clubs and serve on The Midlands Collie Club committee as their health co-ordinator.

'I breed all three colours of the Rough Collie and offer a lifetimes help and advice. I am also on the groomers list for Rough Collies. I have stud dogs available for use in all three colours.'
