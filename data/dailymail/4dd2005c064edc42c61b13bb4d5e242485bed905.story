The 42-year-old spent last season in charge of Royal Antwerp in the Belgian second division but left in May after guiding the team to seventh. 

He has since spent time observing Steve McClaren’s training at Derby and applied for the Leeds job in September, saying: 'I’ve got experience, I know I could take the club forward.' 

Burton chairman Ben Robinson is keen to make an appointment before their next match against Wycombe Wanderers on Monday night. 

Head of youth Mike Whitlow is in caretaker charge of Burton, who currently lie fifth in the table.
