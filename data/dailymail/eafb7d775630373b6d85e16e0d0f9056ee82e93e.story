She is expecting her first child with husband Mike Tindall early in the new year, so Zara Phillips was probably wondering what the experience of giving birth will be like when she visited the Stroud Maternity Unit today.

Dressed elegantly in a draped white T-shirt, a ruched black pencil skirt, black tights and black ankle boots, the 32-year-old daughter of Princess Anne looked radiant and happier than ever as she held her hands protectively over her growing baby bump.

Visiting the Gloucestershire ward to celebrate its recent refurbishment and 60th birthday, the young royal - who announced in July that she and her husband were expecting a baby - seemed relaxed and at ease.

The celebrated equestrian - who in 2012 became the first member of the British Royal family to ever win an Olympic medal, when she and her teammates scooped silver during the eventing final at the London Games - helped the hospital celebrate being saved from closure in 2006 after a hard-fought campaign.

The unit now offers three brand new en-suite birthing rooms, which they hope will encourage expectant mothers to choose to have their babies in the centre.

Though Mike Tindall did not attend the event, the couple, who are now some six months pregnant, did have a night out together at the Boodles Boxing Ball in London on the weekend.

At the event - held at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Saturday, and attended by her cousins Prince Harry, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie -Â  Zara stood out as in a vibrant floor-length gown, rather fittingly in a royal blue.

It is not yet known whether she is expecting a boy or a girl, but Zara 
seemed in good spirits as she smiled for the cameras while picking up 
the bottom of her dress and negotiating her way up the stairs of the venue.

finished off her look with some black high heels, and her blonde locks were tied up simply 
in a ponytail.

The couple's baby will be six months younger than its cousin Prince George, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
