A prominent race lawyer exposed as a crook by the Mail was yesterday booted out of the legal profession and ordered to pay £1.4million in costs.

Shahrokh Mireskandari, 51, was struck off after it emerged he had faked his legal qualifications and hid his criminal convictions while representing celebrity clients.

The conman was found guilty of an extraordinary 104 breaches of the rules governing solicitors’ conduct by a central London disciplinary tribunal.

It ruled that while running London-based law firm Dean and Dean, he racked up debts, overcharged clients, conducted improper litigation, failed to keep proper records and used clients’ cash to pay staff salaries.

The tribunal hearing took place after the Mail revealed in 2008 that Mireskandari:

• Was a fraudster who had conned his way into the UK legal profession

• Had worthless legal qualifications from a mail-drop university in Hawaii

• Overcharged clients while masquerading as a respected race lawyer

• Had an improper professional relationship with crooked Scotland Yard commander Ali Dizaei.

When Mireskandari was exposed by the Mail, he was representing ex-Met assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur in his race claim against Britain’s biggest force and former commissioner, Sir Ian Blair.

As an ‘expert’ on race relations, Mireskandari ‘paralysed’ Scotland Yard with multi-million-pound race relations litigation, often in cahoots with his Iranian compatriot, the since jailed Dizaei.

He even declared he would ‘destroy Sir Ian and his golden circle’ of white officers.

Our investigation also revealed how Mireskandari was in close contact with Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, who publicly described him as a ‘very, very dear friend’ and also as the ‘best lawyer in Britain’.

Such was Mr Vaz’s loyalty to the lawyer that he even attempted to intervene in a court case on his behalf and lobbied for him in a letter to the legal watchdog.

But, in the aftermath of our investigation, Mireskandari was suspended from practising as a solicitor and his firm closed down, Dizaei was suspended and Mr Ghaffur humiliated into dropping his £1million-plus race claim.

The decision to kick Mireskandari out of the legal profession follows a six-week misconduct hearing dogged with attempts by him to halt the proceedings.

After getting the hearing adjourned from April last year, Mireskandari failed to return from Los Angeles to give evidence, instead bombarding the tribunal with applications to adjourn on medical grounds.

He was represented by 17 barristers but panel chairman Jacqueline Devonish said that allegations of dishonesty had been proved.

She said it was ‘not credible’ that the solicitor could have achieved top marks in his doctorate at the discredited American University of Hawaii, while at the same time working full-time and being thrown out of three law schools for poor performance.

It also ruled that ‘without a shadow of a doubt’ he acted dishonestly when he hid his criminal convictions for 15 counts of telemarketing fraud in America from the Law Society and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) when he returned to the UK.

The tribunal found he racked up huge debts at Dean and Dean and then ‘dishonestly and recklessly’ used clients’ cash to prop up his business.

One client’s mortgage account fund was pilfered by Mireskandari to pay off debts.

Another client’s £200,000 bail bond was withdrawn without permission from the court. When a judge ordered it be repaid, Mireskandari was forced to borrow £250,000 from a client to cover the shortfall.

Mireskandari was also found guilty of billing clients for work that had not been done. At the same time, he racked up huge debts to barristers.

When his firm was closed down, he owed more than £1million in unpaid fees.

Mireskandari was also found guilty of participating in an ‘improper scheme’ to reproduce images of a client’s injuries, using a make-up artist, before passing them off as police photographs to the Home Secretary.

It was also found he misled the court on a number of occasions – and attracted critical judgments against him.

The panel found 54 separate breaches of the Solicitors’ Code of Conduct, 36 of the Solicitors’ Account Rules and 14 of the Solicitors’ Practice Rules.

Mireskandari claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated vendetta by the SRA and the Mail. But the tribunal dismissed this.

Striking him off, Miss Devonish said: ‘The tribunal order that the respondent Shahrokh Mireskandari, solicitor, be struck off the Roll of Solicitors and it further orders that he pay the costs of £1.4million.’

Solicitor Mark Boardman, who represented two of his victims, said: ‘The Mail can be justifiably proud of the hard work, dedication and good old-fashioned investigative journalism that brought this scandal to the attention of the public and resulted in today’s verdicts.’

Mansur Rahnema, a retired heart surgeon, instructed Mireskandari to handle his divorce.

The conman bungled the case, presented his client with an £800,000 bill and sued. Years of litigation followed.

‘Thank you for all your courageous reporting,’ Mr Rahnema said. ‘This man is a monster who has caused so much harm to me and my loved ones. He should really be in jail.’

Academic Sheida Oraki instructed Mireskandari for an agreed fee of £1,000. When he presented his bill the figure had risen to £19,000. He sued and drove her to bankruptcy.

‘This is good news but he should never have been allowed to practise in the UK in the first place,’ she said. ‘He has made my life hell.’
