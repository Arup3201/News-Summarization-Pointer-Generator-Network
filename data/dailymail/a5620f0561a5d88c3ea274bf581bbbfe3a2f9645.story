Shola Ameobi will not be re-signing for Newcastle United and will instead try to follow Steven Gerrard to the MLS.

The former Magpies striker - who quit Turkish side Gaziantep last week - has been at the club’s training ground over the past few days receiving treatment on an ankle injury.

That led to speculation that he could be joining United on a deal until the end of the season.

Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver allowed Ameobi to return and receive treatment on an injury

However, Ameobi’s relationship with Newcastle caretaker John Carver - who brought the 33-year-old through the academy - means he has been allowed to use the medical staff and facilities in a bid to regain fitness.

And Carver - former boss of Toronto FC in the MLS - explained: ‘He’s come in because he’s got a problem with his ankle. He knows the medical staff and knows me from way back.

‘We’ve allowed him to come in and get some treatment. He’s actually talking about possibly going to the MLS. If I can help him in that then I will.’

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is also set to move to America to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy
