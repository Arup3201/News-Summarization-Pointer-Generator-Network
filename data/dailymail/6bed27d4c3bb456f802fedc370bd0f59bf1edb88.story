The wife of a former deputy White House counsel under President George W. Bush has spoken publicly for the first time since the 2010 incident when her then husband attempted to kill her.

Margaret Farren was brutally attacked by husband John Michael Farren on January 6, 2010 – two days after she had served him with divorce papers.

The incident occurred at their multimillion dollar mansion in New Canaan, Connecticut, while their two daughters, a baby and a 7-year-old, slept just down the hall.

Margaret suffered broken bones in her jaw and cheek and other injuries from the attack on January 6, 2010

‘I felt like my head was just mush inside, and I thought, “I’m dying,’” Margaret, now 49, told ABC News' 20/20.

‘And then I was thinking, “I've got to hold it together. I have to stay conscious so I can save the girls.'"

Farren, now 62, was sentenced to 15 years in prison last July after a jury found him guilty of attempted murder, first degree assault and risk of injury to a child.

The judge also ordered that he never again have contact with his two daughters.

‘The wounds didn't heal for a long time. The impact was so severe that I completely lost my sense of smell,’ said Margaret.

Farren choked his wife and beat her with a metal flashlight until she lost consciousness at their home in January 2010.

She managed to flee the house with her two daughters. Farren disputed the seriousness of the charges and also tried to use a mental health defense, but a judge didn't allow it.

In a civil lawsuit in 2013, Margaret Farren won a $28.6 million judgment against her ex-husband after she sued him for assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress

'He was on top of me and he was squeezing my neck, strangling me, and slamming my head... into the floor,' testified Margaret who suffered broken bones in her jaw and cheek and other injuries from the attack.

'He said, ''I'm killing you''.'
