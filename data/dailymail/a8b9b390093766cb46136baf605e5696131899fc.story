A massive drug sweep of the University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa has resulted in 99 arrests, including 61 people currently enrolled as students.

The raid of the university campus and several halls of residence was carried out by the West Alabama Narcotics Task Force early Tuesday morning. 

University spokesperson Cathy Andreen said the students arrested will be referred to its judicial affairs process, after which they will receive sanctions up to and including expulsion.

The students also face criminal charges. Jail records show most of those arrested are between 18 and 20 years old and either live on or adjacent to the campus.

Officials have confirmed that 99 people have been arrested in total, with the majority of charges related to the sale or possession of marijuana and the possession of drug paraphernalia.

Police also found drugs including cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, mushrooms and prescription pills, reports AL.com. Several guns and thousands of dollars were also seized.

The drug sweep is the result of an investigation that had been two months in the planning.

Warrants were executed by the task force beginning at 4 a.m. on Tuesday with assistance from the Tuscaloosa County Sherriff’s Office, the Tuscaloosa Police Department, the Northport Police Department, the University of Alabama Police Department and the U.S. Marshal task force.

Fifteen additional arrests were made in January and this month before Tuesday's arrests.

Confidential informants were used to make purchases during the investigation, said Tuscaloosa Police Chief Steve Anderson.

Anderson said the department hoped the arrests would bring drug arrests down and would send a message that his department will not tolerate drug sales.

UA president Judy Bonner has issued a statement saying the university will continue to work with students and parents to address substance abuse issues on campus.

'UA has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the sale or distribution of drugs, on or off campus, and we will continue to vigorously enforce that policy,' wrote Bonner.

'These students represent a small group of UA students. UA will review our current policies and practices to ensure that we are doing all we can to educate students to make the best decisions they can and that we are providing an environment that is conducive to learning.

'Students must understand that they have a choice when it comes to their behavior, and that their decision to violate drug laws and the Student Code of Conduct will have consequences.'
