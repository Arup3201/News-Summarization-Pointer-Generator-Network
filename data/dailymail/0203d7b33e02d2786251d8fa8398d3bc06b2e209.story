Rebecca Clarke has made a meteoric rise at her school to become head teacher in nine years

A former volunteer parent helper has made a meteoric rise at her school to become head teacher.

Rebecca Clarke began as a midday meals supervisor at Greenleas School, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in 2006 when her daughter Elizabeth, now 12, started classes there. 

She went on to take a teacher training course based at the school before taking charge of a reception class.

In 2010 Mrs Clarke, 47, who had worked in the computer hardware industry, was appointed deputy head. 

She was made acting head in 2014 and this month was confirmed as the head teacher of the school, which has 600 pupils aged from pre-school to nine on two sites in the town.

'When I was helping the children skipping in the playground at lunchtime it never occurred to me that I would end up as the head teacher,' she said.

'Because I trained here in the classroom and I have got to know the school well. I never have imagined being head this quickly.

'The biggest challenge is knowing all the people in both schools and trying to get the absolute best for each child.  

'It has helped that I have been at this school all along. My experience in the different roles means I can see things from all perspectives. It is so worthwhile. I love it. This is the best job in the world.'

The governors said Mrs Clarke's experience and dedication were 'invaluable'. 

She began as a midday meals supervisor at Greenleas School, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in 2006 

In a letter to parents announcing the new Head Teacher, the school's Joint Chair of Governors Emily Wilding said: 'Mrs Clarke has been with Greenleas in a number of guises, starting as a midday supervisor before moving on to class teacher, Deputy Head and Acting Head Teacher. 

'Her experience and dedication has been invaluable during the expansion of the school on two sites and we believe she is the best person to lead Greenleas to further success.'

Governor Tim Hodey said: 'Mrs Clarke is very resilient and has brought stability to the school.

'She has a great sense of fun, is loved by the children and respected by the parents.

'She has made a meteoric rise through the ranks and has given a great sense of pride to the school.'
