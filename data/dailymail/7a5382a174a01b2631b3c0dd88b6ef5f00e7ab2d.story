There are characteristics of dogs that particularly ruthless politicians might be happy to possess.

Energetic, loyal, aggressive and deadly are just a few comparisons that might flatter a country's leader.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin will probably be less than happy when he discovers that one internet user has spotted an eerie resemblance between him and this dog

It's the eyes: one Ukrainian internet user noticed the similarity between President Putin and this dog

Kitler: tash the cat, named for its unfortunate facial markings, found fame for resembling Adolf Hitler

The image was posted online by a man from Ukraine, perhaps after noticing the pair's similarly steely stare.

Whatever caused him to notice the likeness one thing's for certain, you wouldn't want to be found laughing about it behind the ex-KGB agent's back.

The comedy comparison is only the latest episode in the weird saga involving the Russian premier relationship with animals.

Animal adventures: Putin has had a long and photogenic relationship with animals, like being pictured in 2010 hunting and riding through the Siberian wilderness just days before his 60th birthday

In one photo opportunity in 2010 the Russian President was seen hunting in Siberia on foot and horseback despite turning 60 that week.

Perhaps channeling his inner Iggy Pop he apparently did the whole thing shirtless.

Keen to show his softer side, the man who has kept Russia in his grip for the last 13 years also drew a cat's bottom for laughing children while on a school trip.

In another bizarre animal-based stunt he flew a microlight aircraft in order to help crane birds navigate a migration route.

Larking around: perhaps keen to show his softer side Putin has often been pictured with various animals

In an interview today Putin said that he has not ruled out running in the country's next presidential elections in 2018.

If he wins another six year term he will be in place until 2024, meaning he will have lead Russia for the last 24 years, the same length of time as Joseph Stalin.

While Putin did step down in 2008 it was only to avoid a constitutional clause forbidding more than two consecutive terms.

Instead he handed power to his ally Dmitry Medvedev while he ran operations from the shadows.

Medvedev duly increased presidential terms from four to six years, then stepped aside as Putin was reelected in 2012.
