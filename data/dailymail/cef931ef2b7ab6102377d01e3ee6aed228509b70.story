A controversial photograph of a woman dressed in a burqa and holding a gun is believed to be Afghanistan's first female policewoman who was gunned down while fighting against Taliban extremists.

The photograph was shared on Facebook by Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie in a campaign to 'ban the burqa' for security reasons after Australia experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history on Thursday.

Senator Lambie shared the image posted by far right British group Britain First in response to Senator Cory Bernardi's opposition to the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women.

'Ban the burqa': Senator Lambie shared this post on her public Facebook page on Thursday night

It is believed that the woman in the photograph, Malalai Kakar, was shot down in her car by the Taliban in 2008, the ABC reports. 

Lieutenant Colonel Kakar was a mother of six married to a United Nations worker and was recognised globally for protecting divorced Afghani women from their husbands.

The photograph is featured in the 'Forsaken' exhibition that displays photos of Afghan women taken by Canadian photographer Lana Slezic.

Ms Slezic, who took the photo in Lieutenant Colonel Kakar's office said she is 'deeply insulted' by the  way the image has been used.

'I'm shocked... I cannot believe how Malalai's image has been really desecrated on Jacqui Lambie's Facebook page. 

'It's a misappropriation of Malalai Kakar's identity of her family. It's an insult to her family and her children and I'm appalled by the way it's been used really,' Ms Slezic said.  

According to the photographer the image was taken to depict Lieutenant Colonel Kakar's hardship as an officer working 'undercover'. She said the policewoman wore the burqa outside the police station but inside was dressed in uniform.

Controversial words: Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. 

Senator Lambie was told to 'get a life' after she echoed  Mr Bernardi's controversial remarks.

The broadcaster quoted Ms Lambie saying: 'I agree whole-heartedly with Senator Cory Bernardi’s comments - and call for an immediate and complete ban on the wearing of burqas in public.

'People can do want they want in the privacy of their own homes – but for the public safety of our children and families – remove the burqa.' 

A spokesman for the conservative Australian Senator said she stood by her message but would review the image. 

Spray: Senator Lambie last week said people who believe in sharia law should 'get out' of Australia.

Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad told Daily Mail Australia Ms Lambie was 'jumping on the phobia bandwagon'.

'I think she should get out more,' Mr Trad said. 'She really seems to me like a misinformed person and should learn a bit more about her fellow Australians.'  

Senator Lambie's statements came after South Australian Liberal Senator Bernardi tweeted: 'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust'.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who himself has said in the past he found the burqa 'confronting', distanced himself from Mr Bernardi's remarks. 

'We shouldn't fret about people's faith. We shouldn't fret about what people wear. We should guard against crime. We should protect ourselves against potential terror,' he told reporters. 

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was scathing about Mr  Bernardi's burqa comments.

'Why on earth is this out-of-touch, out-of-line Senator on a rampage with his ignorant and stupid comments?' he said at a press conference in Canberra.

Last week, Senator Lambie told reporters that people who support sharia law should 'get out' of Australia.

A spokesman for Senator Lambie was unavailable for comment on Friday morning.
