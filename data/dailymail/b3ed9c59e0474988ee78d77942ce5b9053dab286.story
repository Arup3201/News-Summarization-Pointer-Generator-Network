The son of the first person diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus on American soil  spoke for the first time about his father's condition on Tuesday evening.

Karsiah Duncan, 19, arrived in Dallas to visit dad Thomas Duncan from San Angelo, Texas, where he is a student at Angelo State University.

'I hope and keep praying that my family is OK — and that my dad makes it out safely,' Karsiah said. 

The college student spoke briefly and softly to reporters at Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, which has a large Liberian community.

'Thank you church for all the good things you've been doing for my mom, the support given to my family,' Karsiah said. 'Thanks to the hospital for their work in trying to help my dad stay alive.' 

Karsiah's mother, Louise Troh, remains in quarantine after she had contact with Duncan. Troh left Liberia more than a decade ago after a falling out with Duncan — but the two renewed their relationship earlier this year.

Mr Duncan passed away from the disease on Wednesday morning at Texas Presbyterian.

Duncan's family had visited him at the hospital on Tuesday but declined to view him via video because the last time it had been too upsetting.

The relatives glimpsed him using a video system at Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Monday.

But when they returned anew, this time with Reverend Jessie Jackson, they decided such images were too much.

'What we saw was very painful. It didn't look good,' said Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks.

Weeks said he and Duncan's mother were unable to sleep after seeing Duncan's face. 

Authorities in the United States and the public are on alert following Duncan's diagnosis more than a week ago, which raised concerns that the worst epidemic of Ebola on record could spread from three hardest-hit impoverished countries — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Duncan, who arrived in Texas in late September on a commercial flight from Liberia, had been in critical condition since Saturday.

The first case of Ebola being contracted outside of West Africa was reported in Spain and the World Health Organization expects more cases in Europe.

Freelance NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center, which cared for one other U.S. national flown out of West Africa after contracting Ebola and was later discharged.

The drug used in Dallas and Nebraska, brincidofovir, was developed by Durham, North Carolina-based Chimerix Inc. The company said it has been tested in more than 1,000 patients without raising safety concerns.

'We decided this was currently our best option for treatment,' said Phil Smith, medical director of the Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit, which consulted with U.S. health and drug officials before making its decision.

Mukpo is experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the center said.

U.S. health officials said on Tuesday they would unveil within days new screening procedures at the country's airports to address public concern over the possibility of an outbreak.

Texas state health officials said they are monitoring 10 people who had close contact with Duncan and 38 others who came into contact with that group to see if anyone had developed signs of infection.

So far, no one has shown any symptoms, health officials said.

Officials have said this is a critical week to see if any of those exposed in Dallas develop signs of the virus that has killed more than 3,400 people since an outbreak in West Africa began in March, out of nearly 7,500 confirmed, probable and suspected cases.

Dallas residents have mostly taken in news of Ebola within the city limits calmly, but many have kept a close eye on whether it might spread. Cars of Dallas County Sheriff's deputies who were at the scene of the apartment where Duncan stayed have been scrubbed as a precaution, the sheriff's office said.

Prominent civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson met members of Duncan's family and held a prayer vigil on Tuesday in front of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

Jackson said the hospital initially discharged Duncan because he was poor and did not have medical insurance. About two days after Duncan left the hospital, he was taken back by ambulance and put into isolation.

The hospital and health officials have said mistakes were made in handling Duncan.
