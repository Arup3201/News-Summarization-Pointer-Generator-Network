Three and a half years after their debut in the competition, Manchester City are still to fall in love with the Champions League.

The English champions have come a long way in a short time. Manager Manuel Pellegrini has already won two major trophies. Prior to him, Roberto Mancini did likewise.

Europe, however, remains unconquered. To a degree, it remains unknown territory for the club.

In the boardroom at the Etihad Stadium, they do not panic about City’s modest record outside the domestic game.

Winning the Champions League remains important for the club’s owners but there is no great fuss made about a record that shows just one foray beyond the group stages.

What is important, however, is to sense progress. Given the way City played during much of this season’s group section, they will perhaps be glad to be in the last 16 at all. It is clear, therefore, that something of a breakthrough performance is required against Barcelona on Tuesday night if questions are not to be raised about the City template in Europe.

Asked about the subject, the in-form Samir Nasri nodded to the disparity between the club’s football at home and in Europe. He agreed when it was put to him that even the club’s supporters have not yet fully embraced the Champions League.

‘Yeh, I think that’s right,’ said Nasri. ‘We have had lot of success in the Premier League in the last years and the fans are really passionate about it.

‘But in the Champions League we need to create our history to have this special relationship with the fans in that competition, too.

‘A game like Barcelona can be a big step for us and the fans in the competition.’

A year ago, City’s circumstances were similar. Same opposition, same stage of the competition, same sense of uncertainty.

This season, the club’s football in Europe has been little better than before. A comeback at home against Bayern Munich was gutsy, as was a subsequent win in Rome, but there has been little conviction and certainly no consistency.

Pellegrini must only hope a winter programme that has seen his team play slightly fewer games than last season — City are out of both domestic cup competitions — can help ahead of the home game on Tuesday against a team that lost for the first time in 12 games at the weekend.

‘I don’t think that last year we changed our style against Barcelona or showed them too much respect,’ reflected Pellegrini on a tie the Spanish team won 4-1 on aggregate. ‘Maybe we just couldn’t do what we tried to do.’

‘We’d played 19 games in two months so we tried to play with our style another way. We were happy with the way we played in that game, we didn’t just defend all game. We tried to contain Barca but also tried to attack and we couldn’t do it. I think that this year we are going to try to do what we want to do.’

If that appeared a slightly contradictory message from the Chilean then it is not unusual.

His attitude before games of this magnitude always seems to involve leaving as much as possible to interpretation.

Pellegrini’s general theme on Monday was clear, however. He knows his team need to take a lead to the Nou Camp in mid-March and, if they cannot do that, they need to take a goal.

A year ago they managed neither and the second leg in Spain was something of a non-event.

‘Before their last game, Barcelona won 11 games in a row,’ added Pellegrini. ‘In this match we’ll see the real Barcelona. I said last week that it was very important to focus our minds on the Newcastle game and not on Tuesday.

‘Maybe Barcelona didn’t do the same and thought they were just going to beat Malaga. It’s always important for me to try and go into these games and win the game but also win the previous one.

‘Having scored five goals at home against Newcastle is going to give us big confidence for taking on a team like Barcelona, who will try to score goals. The most important thing is to win the game without conceding goals at home.

 ‘In terms of possession of the ball, there are two things we have to think about. The first is we have got to try and get the ball back as quickly as we can and be very intense because they have very gifted, technical players.

‘The second thing — and it’s just as important — is that when we have the ball we can’t give it way cheaply. We have got to have very good concentration for 90, 95 minutes of the game.’

City will be without the suspended Yaya Toure on Tuesday evening but that may be a blessing. For all his influence in the Premier League, the Ivorian’s suspect discipline can be a liability in Europe.

Instead Pellegrini will perhaps field the Brazilian duo Fernandinho and Fernando as defensive midfield shields in a bit to prevent the Barcelona forwards flooding on to City’s back four as easily as they did a year ago.

It is another big Etihad occasion but in order to make it truly memorable, City really need to win.
