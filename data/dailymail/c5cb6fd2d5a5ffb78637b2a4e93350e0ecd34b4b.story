New York Senator Chuck Schumer is asking  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a health alert nationwide on Sunday regarding an illness carried by mosquitoes in Brazil, where this year's World Cup is being played.

According to Schumer, he is concerned about a virus called the chikungunya virus, often referred to as the 'chik-v' virus.

The chik-v virus is not fatal, but causes victims to experience fevers, joint and muscle pain, swelling, headaches, and rashes.

'We have to prevent the spread of the virus' said Chuck Schumer is regards to warning Americans about the possibility of travelers to Brazil for the World Cup bringing back the Chik-V virus

The virus is often carried by mosquitoes, who are the prevalent carriers of the sickness in Brazil.

'We have to prevent the spread of this virus before it reaches the United States in large numbers,' Schumer told reporters, including 1010 WINS’ Glenn Schuck, on Sunday.

'The problem here is the World Cup gives the unfortunate opportunity for the virus to spread among people from all nations of the world who are together,' Schumer said.

According to Schumer, there has already been three cases of chik-v reported in New York this year, as well as another 25 in Florida. Schumer fears that these numbers will rise once fans return to the United States following the conclusion of the World Cup.

Schumer is also calling on U.S. Department of Homeland Security to increase border safeguards, citing the developing threat in the Caribbean, where more than 100,000 people have been affected.

Prior instances of outbreaks of chik-v have occurred in Africa, Asia, and Europe. It was discovered in Tanganyika, modern-day Rwanda, Africa in 1952.

Experts describe the virus as not fatal, but unpleasant.

'This is not a fatal infection; it’s just a miserable infection,' Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of Vanderbilt University’s Department of Preventive Medicine, told CBS2 earlier this month.

The chik-v virus was first discovered in Africa in 1952. It has since migrated worldwide to places in South America, Asia, and Europe

Last week, multiple states reported their first-ever encounters with the virus. On June 11, a person who had just returned from the Caribbean was diagnosed with the virus in Forsyth County, North Carolina. 

Also in June 2014, a Mississippi person who had recently traveled from Haiti was diagnosed with the virus.

There are currently no cures or vaccinations for the disease. However, it generally heals on it's own. The fever is noted to last approximately two days, but the amount of time the muscle and joint pain can last varies by age.

Over 100,000 have been infected with the virus in the Caribbean.

The World Cup is scheduled to continue until July 13. The United States is scheduled to play Portugal at 6pm Sunday.
