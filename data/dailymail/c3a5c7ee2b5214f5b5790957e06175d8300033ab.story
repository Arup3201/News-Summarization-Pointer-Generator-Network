It’s a classic line from Monty Python’s Life of Brian – ‘What have the Romans ever done for us?’

Well now, alongside sanitation, education, irrigation and roads we can add comedy. It appears that many of our favourite jokes – including even the famous Python dead parrot sketch – can be traced back to the Romans.

According to historian Mary Beard, the sketch, in which John Cleese complains to a shopkeeper that the parrot he bought is an ‘ex-parrot’, originally made senators and emperors chuckle.

Historian Mary Beard claims some of the UK's favourite gags, including the famous 'dead parrot' sketch from Monty Python, all came from a Roman joke book

The original version features a man who complains that his slave has died shortly after purchase. The slave trader replies simply: ‘When he was with me, he never did any such thing.’

According to Professor Beard, who presents BBC history programmes, the joke is just one of the ‘Monty Python-esque’ gags that made the Romans laugh.

Enoch Powell once quipped that a talkative barber asked him how he'd like his hair  cut, to which he replied 'quietly' - another joke from the book

‘We have learned how to joke from the Romans,’ she said at a talk to promote her new book Laughter in Ancient Rome: On Joking, Tickling and Cracking Up.

The professor added that we should thank them for the ‘building blocks with which our own modern [comic] repertoire is constructed’.

Much of what we know about classical humour comes from a Roman joke book containing 265 gags known as the Philogelos – translated as Laughter Lover. 

It is thought to be a collection of different manuscripts rather than the work of a single author.

Another favourite joke – credited to former Conservative minister Enoch Powell – is the one about a chatty barber who asks his customer how he would like his hair cut. The customer replies tersely: ‘In silence.’

Professor Beard said: ‘What almost everybody failed to realise – but I’m sure Powell knew because he was one of the world’s best classicists – that joke is actually from the Roman joke book, absolutely the same.’

Other Roman jokes include one about a miser who made himself the heir in his own will and the patient who complains to a doctor about feeling dizzy half an hour after waking up. The doctor replies: ‘Get up half an hour later.’
