Everton hope to finalise a season-long loan deal for Chelsea winger Christian Atsu over the weekend.

Atsu would become the Toffees' second summer signing from Chelsea following the £28million deal which took Romelu Lukaku to Merseyside earlier this week.

The Belgian enjoyed a productive loan spell under Roberto Martinez last season and it is thought the west London side are happy to send another player to work with the Spaniard. 

On the move: Chelsea and Ghana winger Christian Atsu is closing in on a loan move to Everton

Atsu, who moved to Stamford Bridge from Porto last summer, spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem. He scored five goals in 28 appearances for the Dutch side.

Sunderland and Aston Villa were among 12 clubs interested in Atsu, but it appears Martinez has convinced him his immediate future lies at Everton.

The club are also close to securing the transfer of Anderlecht youngster David Henen, who has been training with the squad for more than a week.

The 18-year-old forward is expected to cost around £1.5million.

Meanwhile midfielder John Swift has joined Rotherham United on loan. The 19-year-old midfielder who has represented England at U17, U18 and U19 level has signed for the season.
