Under pressure: Jeremy Hunt leaves his home yesterday morning, where he told reporters he would be releasing all emails and texts to his adviser

Beleaguered minister Jeremy Hunt is to hand over all private texts and emails sent to his shamed special adviser in a bid to save his job.

By giving them to the Leveson Inquiry, the Culture Secretary said yesterday he believed that his contacts with Adam Smith would show that he handled the BSkyB takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire with 'total integrity'.

It came as pressure was mounting for a Whitehall inquiry into claims Jeremy Hunt broke ministerial 
rules in his dealings with the Murdoch empire.

'I will be handing over all my private texts and emails to my special adviser to the Leveson Inquiry and I am confident that they will vindicate the position that I handled the BSkyB merger process with total integrity,' he told reporters outside his London home yesterday morning.

A Westminster sleaze watchdog has this afternoon called for a proper and swift investigation into the case.

Sir Christopher Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the 'obvious' way for this to be done would be for Prime Minister David Cameron to call in his independent adviser on the Ministerial Code, Sir Alex Allan.

His intervention increases pressure on Mr Hunt and on the Prime Minister, whose official spokesman has repeatedly made clear that judgments on breaches of the ministerial code is a matter for Mr Cameron only.

'There can be no doubt that the allegations that have been made about the boundaries and behaviours of ministers, special advisers and the civil service need to be properly investigated,' Sir Christopher said.

'It is important for public confidence in the integrity of government and also in fairness to the individuals concerned that this is done - and done reasonably quickly.'

Getting on with it: PM David Cameron has so far resisted an inquiry and left a school in his constituency today with cup cakes the children made for him

Yesterday Jonathan Stephens, the Culture Secretary’s most senior civil servant, refused ten times to confirm his version of events when he appeared before MPs.

And as Downing Street continued to stand by Mr Hunt, a Tory grandee broke ranks to insist the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, Sir Alex Allan, should look into the affair.

Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, backed Labour’s demands for the case to be referred to Sir Alex.

He said: ‘There was clearly something of a breakdown of good process and good governance.

‘We have a new Cabinet Secretary and he should demonstrate his independence and advise the Prime Minister. If he thinks there has been a prima facie case of a breach of the Ministerial Code, it should go straight to the independent adviser.’

There were also questions over why the affair has been left solely in the hands of the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics.

Labour’s culture spokesman Harriet Harman said: ‘Lord Leveson’s inquiry is of huge importance, but it is not in its terms of reference to look into breaches of the Ministerial Code.

‘That is the job of the independent adviser and the Prime Minister will not allow him to look into this.’

Mr Hunt is fighting for his political life after evidence emerged of emails and texts between Adam Smith, his special adviser, and a Murdoch lobbyist during discussions over whether to allow News Corporation’s BSkyB takeover bid.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Hunt should be able to set out his side of the story 'as soon as possible.'

But he refused to be drawn on whether he backed the call from Mr Hughes for the case to be referred to Sir Alex.

Threat: Rupert Murdoch, who appeared at the Leveson Inquiry this week, questioned Vince Cable saying he was not a fair judge of the bid

'Jeremy Hunt has made it very clear that
he wishes to state his side of the story. It is absolutely right that 
he should be given that opportunity as soon as possible,' he told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One.

Mr Cable also insisted he dealt with the BSkyB takeover bid 'fairly and properly' while it was his responsibility.

The case was passed to Mr Hunt in 2010 after Mr Cable was secretly recorded telling reporters he had 'declared war' on company chairman Rupert Murdoch.

Mr Murdoch told the Leveson Inquiry on Thursday that he expected Mr Hunt to be a 'fairer' judge of the bid than the Business Secretary.

Mr Cable retorted: 'As far as my own role in that whole case is concerned, I dealt with that case fairly and properly and when I go before the Leveson Inquiry, I will take the inquiry step by step through the process and explain exactly what happened and the public will then be fully aware of it.'

On Thursday night, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes joined calls for an inquiry into whether the Culture Secretary breached the ministerial code of conduct.

The senior figure said he could not understand why Prime Minister David Cameron had ruled out referring the controversy over the actions of Mr Hunt’s special adviser to a regulator.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has backed the No 10 stance but Mr Hughes questioned why there should not also be an probe by Sir Alex Allen.

Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel, left, and Jeremy Hunt were revealed, 
mounting pressure on PM David Cameron to launch an inquiry

'What I cannot understand is why the matter of the ministerial code of conduct, which is to do with do you take responsibility for your special adviser, is not something the Prime Minister should immediately refer to the person who has been given the job of doing that, Sir Alex Alan,' he told BBC1’s Question Time.

Asked whether David Cameron agreed with Mr Hughes that an inquiry into potential breaches of the ministerial code was needed, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'No. The Prime Minister made very clear on Wednesday that he has full confidence in the way Jeremy Hunt handled the BSkyB bid.'

Responding to the announcement that Mr Hunt plans to hand over emails and text messages relating to the BSkyB bid to Lord Justice Leveson, the spokesman said it was for the Culture Secretary to prepare and present his own submission.

'Incredible': Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was 'incredible' Mr Hunt was still Culture Secretary

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'Jeremy Hunt has made his statement to Parliament and will provide more information to the Leveson Inquiry. That process should be allowed to happen.'

Labour claim the Ministerial Code was breached three times as Mr Hunt was supposed to be acting in a ‘quasi-judicial’ role determining whether or not to allow the £8billion bid.

Mr Smith resigned on Wednesday insisting his contacts with News Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel went far beyond what Mr Hunt had authorised.

The Culture Secretary is confident that emails and texts between himself and Mr Smith demonstrate he did nothing wrong, and is ready to hand them over to the Leveson Inquiry as he tries to clear his name.

But there was confusion yesterday over his assertion that the senior civil servant at the Culture Department authorised Mr Smith to act as a ‘point man’ with the Murdoch empire.

As he appeared before the public accounts committee, Mr Stephens repeatedly refused to confirm that version of events.

Later the department issued a statement saying he had not felt it appropriate to provide further information ahead of its evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.

A spokesman added: ‘The Permanent Secretary was aware that Adam Smith was among a small number of individuals in the department who were in contact with News Corp and was content with that arrangement.

‘The content and extent of his contact was done without authorisation, and were contrary to the clear requirements set out by Jeremy Hunt and the Permanent Secretary.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was ‘incredible’ that Mr Hunt was still Culture Secretary and accused Mr Cameron of using him as a ‘firewall’.

He said: ‘Why is Jeremy Hunt still in his job? Because David Cameron has questions to answer, and Jeremy Hunt is, if you like, acting as a firewall, and if he goes the questions will then move to David Cameron’s conversations with Rebekah Brooks, with James Murdoch and others.’

While former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott this morning backed Mr Miliband and told the Today programme: 'Hunt must answer in Parliament not to the Leveson Inquiry.'

But former Tory leader Lord Howard responded in the radio debate that Mr Hunt will now be called early by Justice Leveson and should then be given the chance to explain himself.
