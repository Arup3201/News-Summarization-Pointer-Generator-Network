A Melbourne teenager has put his life in danger in a shocking attempt to spray paint a moving train that was captured on camera on Wednesday.

The boy was seen pulling out a spray can to intimidate a passenger as the train began to leave the station after an apparent argument between the two on board.

The incident was captured by a horrified onlooker at Antsey station, in Brunswick, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria.

High-risk: The brown haired boy tried to intimidate someone on the 5pm service departing from Antsey station, in Brunswick, a suburb of Melbourne

The brown-haired teen had alighted the Upfield service, packed with commuters, with a friend after having words with another passenger just before 5pm, The Weekly Review Melbourne Times reports.

After the doors of the train closed he whipped out his spray can with disregard for his own safety.

He wore a black rucksack on his back and appeared unfazed by the immediate danger he put himself in.

Attempting to scare a passenger with whom he had exchanged words on the train, he held the can up against the window.

The boy then leaned closely to the scratched window and bashed the can against the glass numerous times, according to passengers who say they did not know the boy.

It is not clear whether the train was sprayed or damaged as it departed the station.

In the state of Victoria it is an offence to carry graffiti tools on trains.

Under the Victorian Government's Anti-Graffiti Plan, more than $10 million has been committed over four years to support Victorian councils and communities to tackle graffiti.
