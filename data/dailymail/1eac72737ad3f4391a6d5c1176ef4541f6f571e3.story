Tim Sherwood made light of the uncertainty surrounding his future as manager of Tottenham by beckoning a fan from the crowd and allowing them to sit in his seat on the bench.

Sherwood, who faces the axe despite leading Spurs to a sixth-placed finish and qualifying for the Europa League, also gave the supporter his infamous gilet jacket to wear.

Tottenham won 3-0 against Aston Villa at White Hart Lane thanks to first-half goals from Paulinho, Emmanuel Adebayor and an own goal from Nathan Baker.

But it could be Sherwood's final game in charge of the club with Ajax coach Frank de Boer and Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino heavily linked to the post.

In his 
final programme notes of the season Levy chose not to acknowledge 
Sherwood at all, instead choosing to criticise the club's playing style 
even when they have won.

He
 wrote: 'The new signings in the summer had the effect of raising 
expectations and we all started the season with high hopes, yet the 
players undoubtedly needed time to adapt to a new league. We were also 
forced to make managerial changes, which is far from ideal mid-season.

'Our
 sense of falling short, felt by all, including the players, is based on
 some poor performances during the season and knowing we have not 
performed at the level we know we could have done.

'Even
 in games where we gained maximum points, our football was not always 
what we have come to expect and associate with our club.'

During the
 second-half of the win against Villa, with Tottenham cruising to 
victory against their out-of-form opponents, Sherwood summoned a 
supporter, Danny Grimsdale, from the crowd with a smile before presenting him with his 
club-branded gilet jacket which has become a feature of his time on the 
club's bench.

As
 if that wasn't bizarre enough, Sherwood then urged Grimsdale to sit 
alongside his assistants Les Ferdinand and Steffen Freund as 
open-mouthed players looked on in disbelief.

The supporter accepted the invitation before returning to his usual seat close to dugout soon after.

In
 his post-match press conference Sherwood revealed that Grimsdale is a 
regular at White Hart Lane who gives him pointers on where he is going wrong.

He
 said: 'That guy's an expert, seriously. Every week he tells me what to 
do. So I gave him the opportunity to do the job. He bottled it at first 
but then he swallowed it. It was just good banter.

'There
 were a couple I could have picked. We've got the police looking for him
 because he's nicked the gilet. But it's fine, he can have it.'

On
 whether or not he has the backing of other Tottenham supporters, 
Sherwood added: 'Everyone I speak to is quite genuine and gives me a lot
 of appreciation, to be honest.'

Grimsdale spoke to BBC Radio Five Live after the game to discuss his experience and claim Tottenham's treatment of Sherwood has not been very good.

He said: 'It was a great bit of humour and something I won't forget.

'To be fair to him he's not fighting with the fans. He's always happy to chat and have a laugh with us. I called a couple of subs he should make and it just so happened he made them.

'We were 3-0 up at the time and I thought it would be a good chance to bring some youngsters on and he said "you know what, why don't you come and have a go". It was just surreal. I didn't know what to make of it, or if I would get in trouble for going over the barrier.

'I'm a lifelong Spurs fan so I'm not going to turn down the chance to sit in the hotseat. As I was walking away he said "you can keep the jacket" and he shook my hand and patted me on the back.

'I don't think he has been treated particularly fairly by the club and sections of the fans. No one in his position would have turned the job down and he has done the best he can do.

'Performances have been more exciting than under the previous manager. But he's a bit of a wideboy and maybe he has just rubbed people up the wrong way.'

Laughing matter: When asked about the situation afterwards Sherwood claimed it was just banter

Easy win: It was an equally happy day on the pitch as Spurs cruised past Villa to seal sixth spot
