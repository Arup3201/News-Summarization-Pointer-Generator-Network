She earns a generous pay cheque for her work as one of the faces of Burberry.

And Rosie Huntington-Whiteley proved excellent value for money by flying the flag for the iconic British designer in not one, but two stunning creations by the brand.

After dazzling in a daring blue satin gown at the premiere of her film Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon in London last night, the gorgeous model, 24, changed into a chic white and gold dress by Burberry Prorsum for the after-party.

Daring: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wore a slashed white dress by Burberry to the after party of the Transformers 3 premiere in London

Rosie began modelling for Burberry in 2008, and was loyal to the company for one of the biggest nights in her career so far, as she celebrated her big screen debut on home soil.

The Victoria's Secret Angel, 24, had 
the crowds gasping at the London screening of her debut film 
Transformers 3: Dark Of The Moon tonight when she turned up in a risqué 
midnight blue gown.

The 
backless satin dress, custom made for her by Burberry, was slashed 
almost to her navel with only modest drapes of material over her chest.

Spokesperson: Rosie, who models for Burberry, earned her pay cheque by wearing two gowns by the designer

Rosie chose a more covered-up, yet equally daring dress for the after party later in the evening at Morton Members Club in Mayfair.

Her white frock had a high slit that showed off her enviable legs and a slashed front, revealing her décolletage.

The dress featured fierce shoulder detailing and was teamed with tan strappy heels, also by Burberry.

Sapphire and steel: The model looked ravishing in a blue gown by Burberry at the premiere of the film earlier in the evening

The model, who is dating fellow Brit 
Jason Statham, appeared pleased with how the evening went, giggling and 
smiling in the back of her car as she left the after party.

Just last night, she looked equally incredible in a sparkling silver gown for the German premiere of her first ever movie in Berlin.

She's been pushing out all the stops to 
get maximum coverage for her role in the movie, which she wrested from 
Megan Fox, by wearing a series of show-stopping outfits over the past 
few weeks while promoting to film around the globe. 

Back to the future: Rosie, who looked sensational in the sapphire gown, is hoping to do more acting as well as continue with her modelling  

Rosie replaced Fox as the female lead in the film franchise after Megan made derogatory remarks about the director Michael Bay, likening him to Hitler.

She had worked with Bay on a Victoria's Secret advertisement shoot in 2009, and has told how later the director invited her to audition for the role.

Rosie told Elle magazine in May that 
despite the stigma of models branching into acting, she was determined 
to make the most of the opportunities given to her.

Keeping it together: Rosie had some toupé tape to keep herself decent as she posed with the movie's director Michael Bay

She said: 'I love being part of the 
fashion industry but, after almost nine years as a model, I’d be a real 
fool to turn down the chance to try something different.

'Now I have another amazing opportunity and I need to make the best of it.'

Other stars at the premiere included The
Only Way is Essex stars Sam Faiers, Joey Essex, Jessica Wright and 
Maria Fowler, Golden Compass star Dakota Blue Richards, fashion desinger
Christopher Kane, and reality TV stars Calum Best and girlfriend 
Georgia Salpa.

Transformers 3: Dark Of The Moon opens in the UK on June 29.
