A woman has been sensationally arrested in Florida over the death of her five-year-old son on what would have been his 29th birthday.

Timothy Wiltsey went missing at a carnival at Kennedy Park in New Jersey in May of 1991, sparking a nationwide search.

His partial remains were discovered in April the following year at Raritan Center, an industrial site at Edison, New Jersey.

More than 20 years later, police have arrested his mother Michelle Lodzinski at an address in Jensen Beach, Florida, following a routine review of the cold case.

According to reports at the time, Lodzinski, 47, took her son to a carnival in 1991 and allowed her son to ride on some of the attractions.

At the time, it was reported that he asked for a drink and after she turned her back, he had disappeared.

The carnival was closed down while a frantic search took place, but he could not be found.

In the days that followed his desperate relatives and family friends organised several searches in the South Amboy area.

As the appeal for information intensified, thousands of rail workers were handed flyers while his face was shown on big screens at major sporting fixtures.

But police became suspicious after no one at the carnival saw a youngster matching Timothy's description.  

More than two decades later, a grand jury in Middlesex County has indicted her on a first-degree murder charge. 

Lodzinski
 was arrested Wednesday evening around 6 p.m in Jensen Beach, Florida 
after leaving work at the law firm, according to Master Sgt. Frank 
Sabol, a Port St. Lucie police spokesman.

Lodzinski
 was in her car and headed over to her sister's house in Jensen Beach 
when she was pulled over and detained. 'She was arrested without 
incident,' Sabol said. 'She didn't put up a struggle.'

A
 New Jersey prosecutor said in a statement that the new information that
 led to her arrest arose out of a cold case review of the boy's unsolved
 1991 disappearance.

'Following
 a routine, cold case review of the evidence and facts surrounding the 
disappearance and murder of Timothy Wiltsey, a new investigation was 
conducted and the matter was presented to the grand jury,' Middlesex 
County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey said in a statement released Thursday.

The
 grand jury charged that Lodzinski “did purposely or knowingly kill 
Timothy Wiltsey, or did purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily 
injury upon Timothy Wiltsey, resulting in his death…,' according to 
Carey.

Sabol
 said that Port St. Lucie police have been assisting New Jersey 
prosecutors on the case since at least 2012 - sitting in on witness 
interviews, executing search warrants and navigating the local court 
system, but declined to divulge further details.

Lodzinski, 
who lives with two other sons, 12 and 16, in Port St. Lucie, 'hadn't 
been on our radar until a couple years ago, when we were contacted by 
New Jersey [prosecutors],' Sabol said.

'I checked our [St. Lucie County] jail records and we are not coming up with anything for her in this county,' he said.

Her
 bail was set at $2million though and it is not yet clear whether she 
will waive an extradition hearing and return to New Jersey.

Fellow employees at a civil litigation firm where Lodzinski works were 'stunned' to learn of her arrest.

'Everybody
 here was certainly surprised, stunned and saddened,' said an employee 
of GARY, WILLIAMS, PARENTI, WATSON & GARY, P.L, who requested 
anonymity in return for speaking freely.

'The shocking thing is that her two sons are just these amazing, lovely children. She was a proud, doting mom to them,' the source said, adding that the two boys had occasionally visited their mother at work. 'Who would have ever known...' the source said, before going silent for a moment. 'Unbelievable.'

The firm handles civil litigation, including medical malpractice, personal injury and wrongful death cases.

'We
 had no knowledge of any of this,' the source told MailOnline on 
Thursday morning. 'She came to work every day, but we had really no 
knowledge of any other - certainly of this particular incident - but in 
any other incidents that she was involved in.'

Police arrested Michelle Lodzinski at an address in Jensen Beach, Florida, following a routine review of the cold case involving the death of her son

A grand jury in Middlesex County has indicted Michelle Lodzinski on a first-degree murder charge

The colleague said Lodzinski never made mention of her missing son, or her 1995 guilty plea after claiming the previous year that she herself was abducted by FBI agents.

Lodzinski also pled guilty in 1998 to stealing a former employer's computer.

'She does have two kids, I know, in Port St. Lucie,' the colleague said, but Lodzinski divulged very little at work about her personal life.

Kori Searcy, spokeswoman for the law firm, said Lodzinski has long been a member of the Stuart, Florida legal community, and has worked for at least three other area law firms since the mid-1990s.

Retired New Jersey judge Alan A. Rockoff, who was Middlesex County Prosecutor in 1991, said the disappearance was a heartbreaking unsolved case that has been 'bugging' him for years. 

'It’s gratifying to know that you’re suspicions were warranted in cases like this,' he said on Thursday. 'You grow a tough skin in law enforcement work, and I’ve been doing it for a lot of years, not only as prosecutor but a criminal judge.

'But when you have a young child with a face like Timmy Wiltsey,' he said, sighing deeply, 'you can never forget it.'

Rockoff said that despite suspicions, investigators could not nail down sufficient evidence for an arrest back in 1991.

'There were several factors that more than satisfied us that we were looking at the right suspect,' Rockoff said. 'Her inconsistencies [in her story], some of the actual observations that were made [by investigators], some of her associations and the fact that some of the associates wouldn’t talk to us – all made us confident we were moving in the right direction.'

'Acknowledging the presumption of innocence and the state’s burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt, it’s a step in the right direction. I’m pleased that this case wasn’t put in a back shelf to gather dust.'

He declined to speculate on what evidence may have prompted Lodzinski’s arrest.
