Kellie Littmoden, 37, from Rayleigh in Essex is the proud mother of two adorable little girls, Eden, three, and Daisy, six months.

But while she and husband Darren, 42, appear to have the perfect family, their happy smiles don't tell the whole story.

For while Daisy is developing normally, her older sister Eden has Phelan-McDermid Syndrome [PMS], a genetic condition so rare, there are only 1,000 confirmed sufferers worldwide.

As a result, Kellie and Darren had never even heard of PMS, which is caused when genes that are part of chromosome 22 either don't develop or are deleted.

'We were shocked and upset,' says Kellie of the moment she first learned of her daughter's diagnosis, 'but we didn't really understand what it meant.

'We didn't know anything about genetics or anyone who had a genetic condition. But then we looked it up on the internet and got as much information as possible.

'Darren and I feel that getting as much information that you can get is the best thing to do. It was a big shock but it gave us some idea of what we were dealing with.'

Quite what she is dealing with remains virtually unknown, with much still waiting to be discovered about the disorder - not least how long sufferers can expect to live.

What is certain is that between 97 and 99 per cent 
of children born with the disorder will never speak, while the ability 
to walk develops at an unusually slow pace.

Unsurprisingly, this is something that weighs heavily on Kellie's mind. 'I think it's the not knowing, the uncertainty that is the worst part.

'It's the thought of Eden never having any speech at all. Also the thought of her never being able to do anything for herself. We're very aware that Eden is probably going to live with us forever.'

Eden, whom her mother describes as a 'happy and healthy little girl', currently spends her days at nursery or going for walks in the park with her parents like any other child.

And Kellie also hopes she will one day go to school as well as learning how to do things like feeding herself and walking on her own two feet.

But for now, the focus is on making sure Eden is happy and living as normal a life as possible, although Kellie does worry about how some people might react to her.

'I'd like to think that people have gone 
beyond [discriminating against disabled people] but they are always 
going to stare because Eden's different,' she says, tentatively.

'I don't think she looks very 
different but if you watch her for any amount of time, you can see that 
she is different.'

Children, however, have proved considerably more accepting and Kellie says that being around other infants at nursery has proved hugely beneficial.

'Nursery has been brilliant for Eden and
seeing other children running around has just been positive,' she smiles. 'As Daisy 
gets bigger, that will be brilliant for Eden as well.'

Kellie says Eden's illness has also helped to bring her family closer together, not least because of the prolonged crying fits that she, like the majority of those with PMS, suffers.

'Although Eden is happy 99 per cent of 
the time, sometimes, she does wake up in the night and she will be 
screaming for hours and there's nothing we can do,' says Kellie.

'You know, you've got to support each other through things like that and through difficult times together.

'It's made me a different person but for 
the better,' she continues. 'It's opened my eyes to a lot of things and I think it's made
 us closer and it has made us stronger.'

While Kellie is positive about Eden's condition and says she will always love her daughter regardless, her biggest hope now is that scientists will find a cure.

'If I could have anything in the world, 
it would be that Eden didn't have it,' she confesses. 'They [scientists] are doing 
studies all the time but I'm not sure I'll see a cure in my lifetime.'

In the absence of a cure, Kellie says she hopes, at the very least, that Eden will manage to develop some speech and say the thing she most wants to hear: The word 'Mum'.

'Never hearing her call us Mum 
and Dad is something I miss,' admits Kellie. 'It's things like that that people take for granted.

'I would love for
 her just to have a little bit of speech and to be able to communicate 
properly.'

Most of all, however, Kellie just wants Eden to be happy and healthy. 'Even though she's got PMS and lots 
of other children with it have things like seizures, she is healthy,' she explains.

'I 
just want her to be healthy and make progress - no matter how slow it is.'
