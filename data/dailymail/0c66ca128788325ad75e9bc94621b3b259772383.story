Paul Gascoigne's 'no-show' on This Morning has been denied by a representative who said 'nothing had been agreed' between the show's bosses and the star, who is now in Bournemouth.

The 46-year-old, who is reportedly facing a 'daily battle' with alcoholism and has recently attended rehab, had been expected to appear on the ITV show to discuss a documentary about his life and drinking habits.

This Morning host Phillip Schofield, 51,
told the show's viewers: ‘He was supposed to be here this morning, but 
no one can find him.’

But a representative for Paul Gascoigne 
denied he had gone missing and told MailOnline that the star is 
currently at home in Bournemouth.

He said: 'There had been a 
discussion with the This Morning Team on the prospect of Paul coming in 
but nothing had formally been agreed and signed off and no transport had
been arranged.

'It was not a question of a no-show.'

'He
is now at home in Bournemouth. He's a recovering alcoholic so it's a 
daily battle but he's doing fine and keeping in good shape.'

An ITV insider told The Mirror that the star had failed to turn up to the show, saying: ‘It became apparent late on Monday he probably wasn’t going to be able to make it.

‘He
couldn’t be located in the morning, or there still would have been time
to get him on air. It’s fair to say he went Awol, which is a concern, 
given his condition.

‘There were some fears he might have gone on another bender and not made it back home in time for the show.’

In the documentary, the former Spurs and England player admitted that he knew he ‘would drink again’.

The Geordie player was rushed to hospital in February this year and almost died when he suffered a serious reaction after attempting to give up alcohol.

He was readmitted to hospital in July after fans found him 'drunk and sick' outside a London hotel.

And Gascoigne was fined £1,000 for a drunken assault on a railway security guard last month.

The former midfielder also said he thought he would be better off dead than living with addiction.

He said: ‘At least if I did pass away, I wouldn’t be in this pain all the time.’

Over
a three-month period, Paul gave cameras unprecedented access to 
his private life for the one-off, ITV documentary, which portrays the 
real Paul Gascoigne through his own words and the words of the people 
closest to him.

The documentary called Being Paul Gascoigne, which aired on Monday night also showed the star rummaging through cupboards full of sweets as a substitute for his alcohol addiction.

Gazza admitted on the ITV show that despite his well-publicised attempts at rehab, he 
will hit the bottle again and that his alcoholism will kill him.

'I know probably in the future I am going to drink again... and that means a wooden box and six nails,' he tells film maker Jane Preston.

Paul, affectionately known as Gazza, is followed around by cameras as he returns to the UK after being rushed into intensive care in America, after he was too unwell to receive medical care at the rehab centre where a reaction to the treatment nearly killed him.

He also told the filmmaker: 'I didn’t ask to be an alcoholic. It’s like asking someone why he is a diabetic. I wish I wasn’t but I am. If I’m having a good day I’ll make the most of it because I don’t know what tomorrow brings, or even the next five minutes.'

The film, which ITV admits it paid Gascoigne a fee for, features his family wife Sheryl and children Bianca and Regan and sees them gather together for the first time in years to celebrate his 46th birthday.

On the film daughter Bianca said: 'I 
would like them to get back together. When the family is back together 
there’s a nice vibe. It just feels completed.

'Everyone
wants to save him, but he can only save himself. And I’m just so 
pleased and proud that at the moment he seems to be doing that.'

But
the film also shows the dark side to the perils of alcoholism, with 
CCTV footage of Gazza guzzling from a bottle of gin in a London corner 
store, and how he had to be taken back into care by wife Sheryl.
