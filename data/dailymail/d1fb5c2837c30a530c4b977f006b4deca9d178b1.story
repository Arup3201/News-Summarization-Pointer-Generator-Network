Jose Mourinho has backed Wayne Rooney to take this summer’s World Cup by storm – but warned the England striker this is his last chance to shine.

The Manchester United star has failed to score in the last two tournaments but will lead the line for Roy Hodgson’s side in Brazil.

Mourinho, who tried to sign Rooney for Chelsea last summer, believes the 28-year-old will cope with having the weight of a nation’s expectations on his shoulders.VIDEO: Scroll down for Rooney: This is the one where I have to show what I can do

‘He is not a kid anymore, he is not an old player at the end of his career, he is in what I call the best age,’ he told Yahoo. ‘I think it is his World Cup and I think he has also a role as a leader in the team, a little bit similar that he had also in United this season.

‘He is a guy with responsibilities in the national team, I think he is ready to cope with this pressure.

‘ I think that can play a positive role in his ambition, in his anger to succeed. I have faith in him, I have faith that he can do it.’

Mourinho also admitted he has no idea how England will perform in Brazil, given their unpredictable nature.

Hodgson’s men reached the quarter-finals at Euro 2012 before losing to Italy on penalties. They will renew hostilities with Cesare Prandelli’s men on Saturday in Manaus.

’England is the kind of team where I am always expecting something good but I am never surprised when things go wrong,’ added Mourinho.

‘When people speak sometimes about not enough quality in the team I always disagree and I remember for example the England team in 2004, it was the European Cup in Portugal which is the year where I come to England for the first time.

‘Even in that time people were already saying that the team was not good enough to win the competition and I remember the England team in 2004, I remember lots of them, it was full of top players from the top teams in the country.

‘You go now and obviously you have some boys who are not playing in the top teams in the country but you have players from Chelsea, from United, City, Arsenal, Liverpool, so the top five all represented in high numbers in the national team so you have quality, you have experience, you have international experience, you have everything so why not be a candidate?

‘If England wins the World Cup for me it is only a surprise because you won only once and you won when I was three years old so only because of that I would say, oh that’s a surprise but because of the players and the experience and the stature that almost all of them have, it wouldn’t be a surprise but at the same time, if they don’t go through the group phase it is not a surprise either to me.’

When asked who he thinks will win the World Cup, Mourinho said he believes the trophy will not be won for the first time.

‘I will be very surprised if there is a big surprise,’ he said. ‘I will be very surprised if somebody is going to win the World Cup for the first time.

‘I don’t see a national team with conditions to do that, to break what used to say the stability. In South America, the South Americans think they are going to be strong and they have two or three strong teams.

‘I don't think the Africans, despite fantastic players and much more experience as a team, I don't think they can break the quarter final wall. In Europe you have always the traditional two or three, maybe in Europe could come some outsider but I don’t see there will be any big surprise.’
