A Florida jury in the mail and immigration fraud trial of a Brazilian-born former professional race car driver could end up seeing much more of the defendant than they probably bargained for.

If 43-year-old Rogerio Scotton - who is acting as his own attorney - gets his way, jurors will be forced to watch sex tapes he made with his wife.

Scotton has introduced the X-rated evidence as proof that his relationship with his Cuban-born wife - who is now an American citizen - isn't a sham marriage for immigration purposes.

Scotton, who lived in Boca Raton before his March 2012 arrest, has been charged with 27 counts of mail fraud and two counts of lying to immigration authorities.

Authorities say Scotton was behind a multimillion-dollar mail-fraud ring that scammed shipping companies like FedEx, UPS and DHL by creating fake accounts that fraudulently billed retail giants like Target, WalMart and Apple for millions of dollars.

According to his indictment, Scotton's online business sold electronics to customers in Brazil. Authorities say he used the phony accounts to ship purchases overseas.

Scotton is only now representing himself after having falling outs with six defense attorneys who previously represented him. He maintains that he is innocent of all the charges filed against him and feels that showing photographs and videos of he and his wife engaged in what U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenbaum described as 'some very intimate acts' will prove that the relationship is legit.

After Scotton asked to play the videos for the jury, Rosenbaum scheduled a hearing to determine whether it would be legally appropriate to show the videos to a jury.

Rosenbaum told Scotton that she isn't going to just 'play that stuff in front of the jury and see what's on there' without first viewing it herself, according to Sunsentinal.com.

'I don't think that it would be fair to your wife,' Rosenbaum told Scotton, emphasizing that she needs to make sure that he gets a fair trial without violating his wife's privacy unnecessarily.

'Why is the privacy of my wife important at this point?' Scotton asked the judge. 'I'm facing jail time.''[Let's] see if we can figure out a less intrusive way to prove the same thing," Rosenbaum responded.

Rosenbaum ordered Scotton - who has been in police custody for more than 22 months - to turn the videos and photographs over to prosecutors to see if they could come to a diplomatic understanding in regards to his relationship with his wife without playing sex tapes featuring her.

Scotton, who once competed in the Miami Grand Prix and other NASCAR events, maintains that he has not committed any crimes.
