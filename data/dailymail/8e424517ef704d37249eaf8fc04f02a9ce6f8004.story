Dozens of people have died in Kenya after drinking a toxic batch of illicit moonshine thought to be laced with industrial alcohol.

Many more victims are fighting for their lives in hospital and some have even gone blind after the bootleg liquor went on sale in four counties in the east African country.

Reports on local television showed victims writhing in pain in hospitals in the eastern and central counties of Embu, Kitui and Kiambu.

Lethal brew: Many victims are fighting for their lives in hospital and some have even gone blind after the bootleg liquor went on sale in four counties in the east African country

David Kimaiyo, Kenya's police chief, said it seems likely all 61 of the known victims were poisoned by the same batch of homemade liquor.

He said it was probably laced with methanol - a cheap industrial variety of alcohol added to give it more kick, but which is poisonous to the nervous system.

As little as 10ml of pure methanol can destroy the optic nerve, rendering drinkers blind.

Reports of deaths first began to emerge on Sunday night, said Mr Kimaiyo.

In Kiambu County, where 11 people have died, local Police Commander James Mugera said authorities were looking out for more victims.

Embu Police Commander William Okello said at least 24 people died while 77 were in hospital after consuming the brew.

Police have arrested a woman there; her husband is also among the dead.

John Mututho, chairman of the state-run National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse, echoed police claims that the spirits all probably originated from the same batch.

Drinking dens selling illicit home brews from jerry cans are common in the back streets of many impoverished neighbourhoods in Kenya.

Mr Mututho, a former MP, helped bring in an alcohol control law in 2010, but to little effect.

'One of the ladies who is now blind said they started drinking at 5 a.m.,' Mr Mututho told Citizen TV. 'There is no outlet in Kenya which is authorised to open at 5am In fact, the earliest it should be (is) 5pm.'

With more than half of Kenyans living below the poverty line, few can afford to buy legally sanctioned alcoholic drinks. Illicit brews are popular, but occasionally lead to deaths when unscrupulous traders lace them with methanol to boost profits.

In June 2005, 45 people were killed from illegal alcohol laced with methanol to boost its strength.

Five years earlier, about 130 people died from a toxic batch in Nairobi.
