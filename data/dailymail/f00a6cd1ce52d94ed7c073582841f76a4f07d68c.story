Budget price mince pies from Aldi have beaten luxury versions from the exclusive Fortnum & Mason store, which cost almost eight times more.

The filling was ‘lush, spicy and juicy’, while the rich and golden pastry was ‘thin, crisp and light’, according to a blind taste test by leading bakers and pastry chefs.

The survey was organised by Which? and reveals it is possible to entertain friends and family with quality food and wine without busting the budget.

Aldi's Specially Selected 6 Luxury Mince Pies have trumped brands almost eight times more expensive in an annual taste test by consumer group Which?

Harrods only managed fifth place with its Luxury Almond & Brandy Mince Pies at £9.50 for six

Aldi’s Specially Selected 6 Luxury Mince Pies at just £1.69 for six beat 11 other rivals, while second place went to Lidl Snowy Lodge 6 Luxury Mince Pies at £1.79 for six.

Harrods only managed fifth place with its Luxury Almond & Brandy Mince Pies at £9.50 for six.

Fortnum & Mason, the London store synonymous with quality and style, came in bottom with its Traditional Mince Pies at £12.95 for six.

The Fortnum & Mason mince pies work out at £2.16 each, which compares to just over 28p for Aldi’s own luxury version.

The pies were scored on appearance, aroma, texture and taste by a panel that included the award-winning baker, Dan Lepard, and renowned pastry chef Will Torrent.

Their verdict is a blow for the Piccadilly store, which has a long and proud history dating back some 307 years and is particularly respected for its luxurious Christmas fare and hampers.

It could not be more different to the budget chain Aldi, which operates a no-frills approach to shopping. Staff are in short supply, while packing and paying is often hectic given the pace that items are swiped through the checkout.

However, the German-owned discounter is seeing enormous growth of more than 30 per cent a year, not least because it is attracting well-heeled and sharp elbowed shoppers from middle and high income families.

The success has come on the back of its offer of award-winning prestige wine, spirits and food at discount prices.

The mince pies are not the only Christmas products that Aldi can crow about. Its £3.89 Connoisseur Christmas Pudding came top in a blind taste test by the Good Housekeeping Institute, while its Specially Selected Luxury Champagne Christmas Pudding was runner up.

Both beat the best that Harrods, Heston Blumenthal and the major supermarkets had to offer.

The Which? blind taste tests also looked at the best value sparkling wines and champagne, which suggest putting fizz in to a party can also be done on a budget.

The best of the sparkling wines was the Co-op’s Prosecco DOC Special cuvée Brut, which is normally £9.99 a bottle, but is currently on promotion at just £6.49.

Second place went to Tesco Finest Prosecco DOC at £9.99, while Lidl’s Conegliano Valdobbiandene Prosecco Superiore DOCG 2012 was third at £7.29.

The Co-op said sales of Prosecco from Italy has doubled in the past year and it now outsells Cava from Spain by four bottles to one.

The Which? tasters described the winning Prosecco as ‘clean and soft with floral and peachy perfumes and a hint of lemon peel’.

The best champagne was from Waitrose with its Blanc de Noirs Brut NV at £21.99, which beat the much more expensive Lanson Black Label Brut NV at £32.99 in to second place.

Britain is fast developing a strong reputation for its wine. Which? said the best currently on offer is the Marks & Spencer Marksman English Sparkling Brut NV Blanc de Blancs Vintage 2009 by Ridgeview at £26 a bottle. It was marginally ahead of the Ridgeview Bloomsbury 2010  at £24.99,  which is available online and from Waitrose.
