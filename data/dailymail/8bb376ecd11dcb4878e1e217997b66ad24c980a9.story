A Las Vegas man has pleaded guilty but mentally insane to hacking a 4-month-old baby in a stroller to death with a medieval-style battle ax and critically wounding the child's mother in 2010.

Harold Eugene Montague's public defense lawyer, Norm Reed, said his client plans to apologize and explain his delusions when he is sentenced to a life in prison July 30 in order to bring some closure to the victims, neighbors and first-responders traumatized by the shocking attack.

'It will be important for everyone involved to hear Harold's account,' Reed told The Associated Press. 'The story he tells is a delusional story. It's been gut-wrenching for everybody.'

Closure: Harold Montague, 38, pleaded guilty but mentally insane Thursday to hacking a 4-month-old baby in a stroller to death and 
critically wounding the child's mother in a sidewalk attack four years ago

Montague, 38, pleaded guilty Thursday in Clark County District Court to first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, two counts of attempted murder and battery on a police officer.

The plea deal with prosecutors means Montague will not be put on trial or face the death penalty, but will be imprisoned for the rest of his days with no chance of parole.

'Nobody would be comfortable with Harold getting out of prison,' Reed said, 'but I don't think executing him is appropriate either. That's why we came to this conclusion.'

The plea deal also means that Sandra Lisset Castro will not have to testify again about hearing her attacker laugh and mock her as she begged him to stop attacking her and her child, Damian Avila Castro.

Castro testified at a preliminary hearing in April 2010 that her face was split open and her jaw had to be surgically reattached after the February 2010 attack. She said her right eye was irreparably damaged.

Her son's overturned stroller was left next to a bloody stain in the street.

Montague also stabbed his profoundly disabled sister-in-law, Monica O'Dazier, some 20 times inside their home before bursting outside and attacking Castro and her son, police said. O'Dazier was treated for her injuries and survived.

A neighbor who witnessed the attack, dialed 911 and helped Castro once police subdued Montague, testified through tears that the incident caused her to suffer an emotional breakdown. She said she spent seven days in psychiatric care.

On the emergency call, which was 
played in court, the neighbor is heard shrieking, 'Oh my God! Her face 
is split open where he hit her with the hatchet!'

Montague told police he had no memory of the attacks.

His wife, Erricca Montague, testified that the attack weapon used to hang on the wall of their home.

She said her husband sometimes smoked marijuana but didn't take other drugs and never drank alcohol. She testified she hadn't felt her husband was a danger to her, their three children or her disabled sister. But he also hadn't been eating and spent several sleepless nights pacing the floor before the attack.

Reed and defense lawyer Andrea Luem never sought a mental evaluation or challenged Montague's fitness for trial.

'Competency and mental illness are two different things,' Reed said. 'He understands the charges against him and is able to aid in his defense. With Harold it's mental illness.'

'It would be impossible for us to say Harold would be fine if he was released,' the defense attorney said.

Police say just before noon on February 11, 2010, Sandra Castro was pushing her son, Damian, in a stroller near the intersection of Sahara Avenue and Maryland Parkway when Harold Montague stormed out of his one-story house at 1609 San Pedro Avenue and attacked the mother and son with a hatchet.

The infant was killed on the spot with a blow to the head, while his mother was gravely wounded. Montague did not know the family.

When police entered Montague’s home, the ax-wielding man lunged at one of the responding officers, causing him minor injuries.

When investigators searched the dwelling, they came upon Montague's disabled sister-in-law suffering from at least 20 stab wounds. 

According to police, the man attacked Monica O’Dazier, who had been in his care for six years, in the presence of his two small children before bursting out into the street and hacking Sandra Castro and her son.

Following his arrest, Montague told police he had no memory of the incident.

During a court appearance in April 2010, a severely scarred Ms Castro described the horrific attack through a translator.

'My face and my head. Those are the parts of my body where he was striking me,' she said.

'I was saying in English, "Please, please leave me alone!" But he wouldn't listen to me.

'Every time he would hit me, he would laugh out loud. I was begging him to let me go, and he was mocking me.'
