Families will be able to shop by pointing their smartphone at TV commercials, window displays and print advertisements, using tech backed by the world’s biggest brands.

The British entrepreneur behind the innovation claims it is so powerful the company will become the UK’s answer to Google or Facebook.

The smartphone’s camera captures a barcode-type logo, called the PowaTag, which automatically links to the advertiser’s store and allows an instant purchase.

The same tags will be used on staple products, such as coffee machine pods or laundry products, included in the weekly shopping.

Again families will be able to take a picture with the smartphone to create a virtual shopping list and link to the supermarket to re-order them. 

Powatag is a smartphone app that lets shoppers buy products by pointing their phone at adverts.

The smartphone camera captures a barcode-type logo on compatible adverts, which automatically link to the advertiser's store.

Powatag can also listen to radio and TV adverts and link to relevant stores using audio clues.

Shoppers can add multiple payment options to the app and use it to create a virtual shopping list.

Powatag can be used on a range of products from groceries to clothes and the British firm has already signed up 240 global brands from Adidas and Reebok, to Universal Music and the world’s second largest supermarket group, Carrefour.

British tech firm Powa Technologies has already signed up 240 global brands from Adidas and Reebok, to Universal Music and the world’s second largest supermarket group, Carrefour.

It is the brainchild of internet entrepreneur and one-time City whizz-kid, Dan Wagner, who has become a multi-millionaire on the back of past investments in a series of tech firms.

The 50-year-old, who was brought up in London, has something of a reputation as a flamboyant and successful salesman rather than a tech geek.

He met his wife, Susan, who was working as a model in Japan, by pretending to be journalist from The Face magazine who was writing a feature.

Wagner said: ‘It's not normal for a British company to say that we'll be the best at something, not in technology. But we have built the first British true internet sensation. This is Britain’s first potential Google or Facebook.

‘We're going to beat the Americans at this. We're going to beat everyone at this.’ 

If a user was near a coffee shop, for example, they might be sent a voucher for a cappuccino or they could be sent details of a credit card offer when near a bank. While browsing a magazine, the reader could also use the photo to purchase the product, mock-up pictured

The company raised £60million to develop and launch the service after showcasing the technology to investors in the USA. It was the single biggest investment in any start-up tech company in 2013.

The father of two, who left school at 16, believes the technology will be generating sales totalling hundreds of millions of pounds by next year.

It uses both the eyes and the ears of smartphones, like Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy, that have become essentials of modern life. 

The handset microphones can capture a so-called Audiotag on radio commercials, which will then provide links to a store and product.

Wagner’s Powa Technologies is launching the new technology in New York and London, while the firm has also opened offices in 12 other countries .

It makes its money by taking a small fee, typically 25p or 0.1 per cent of the price paid for the item, whichever is the greater.

The app and smartphone technology also lets retailers target consumers with specific offers that are sent direct to their handsets.

High street beacons monitor the movements of shoppers signed up to its service via the phone and Bluetooth radio transmissions.

If they are near a coffee shop, for example, they might be sent a voucher for a cappuccino or they could be sent details of a credit card offer when near a bank.

The offers would be tailored to the individual’s tastes, and based on their purchase history.

While the company is selling the technology as a way to help shoppers, privacy consumers may be concerned about the tracking function and creation of personal profiles.

However, this seems unlikely to hold back the innovation in Britain, where shoppers have shown enormous enthusiasm for hi-tech shopping.  Spending on web shopping in this country is already the highest in the world at an annual average of £1,175 per head.

PowaTag has signed up 35 large charities who will be able to use the services free of charge. People will be able to donate to TV and radio appeals instantly without paying handling fees.

Speaking today at the worldwide launch of PowaTag in New York, Mr Wagner said companies currently lose sales because consumers are simply unable to make a purchase when they see an ad. His technology turns this impulse to buy into a sale.

‘The retail sector is being forced to respond to growing market pressures from customers wanting greater levels of control and freedom of access and choice on how they purchase goods,’ he said. 

‘Retailers can no longer afford to think in terms of online verses offline – they must seriously rethink how they connect in-store and online strategies.

‘Our hybrid combination of technologies which include Bluetooth beacons, instant payment authentication and mobility enable retailers to have a richer engagement with their customers and understand their needs and cater for them in a more focused way. 

‘Consumers also benefit from having a vastly improved shopping experience.’

The E-commerce director at Universal, Stephen Partridge, backed the technology, saying: ‘PowaTag will transform the way fans access and purchase music and merchandise from their favourite artists, both online and in the real world.’
