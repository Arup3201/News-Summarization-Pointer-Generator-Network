The winner of a ‘best booty’ competition in a remote part of the Northern Territory has vowed to defend her unexpected title after being inundated with offers to compete in more local butt-shaking contests.

Local girl Megan Craufurd, 19, was not planning to have her derrière judged when she turned up to the Humpty Doo Tavern, in Humpty Doo, a small town situated approximately 40 km from Darwin, on Saturday night.

‘They didn’t really explain what they were looking for or anything. We just had to get up on stage and dance and wiggle our bums,’ Megan told Daily Mail Australia.

Megan Craufurd, 19, won the Best Rural Booty competition at the Humpty Doo Tavern in the Northern Territory on Saturday night 

She decided to get involved in the competition when she found out it was more than a superficial show and was actually raising money for the Leukaemia Foundation charity.

‘It’s been a bit crazy. At first I wasn’t aware it was for Leukaemia but when I got there and saw all the people I thought "everyone somewhere down the line has been affected by the disease" and I wanted to help,’ Megan explained.

The Sportsco manager, from Virginia in the Northern Territory, admitted it was ‘a bit nerve wracking’ at first.

Her behind was judged by one man who had made the highest-bid of $250 to have the honour of deciding which of the ten female contestants had the best booty.

‘I enjoyed it so much in the end, it was such a spontaneous thing, it was a lot of fun,’ Megan said.

The teen said she received plenty of praise from the men in the audience but her biggest fan was her boyfriend.

Megan was surprised when she was chosen out of 10 other girls and donated her winnings to the Leukaemia Foundation 

‘He was in the crowd cheering me on. I think he was a bit nervous at first but then he realised it was for a good cause,’ she said.

Megan gave her $200 winnings to the charity and has now been asked to do other competitions to try and raise more money.

She was ‘surprised’ she won but admitted she does ‘keep fit and active’.

‘I play a lot of netball and football but this wasn’t something I was planning on doing,’ she laughed.
