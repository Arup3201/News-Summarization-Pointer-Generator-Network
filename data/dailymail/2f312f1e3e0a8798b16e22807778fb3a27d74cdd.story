A two-level convenience store in Sydney's south east sold under the hammer for $4.45 million - $1.85 million above the reserve

The building has a grocery store on 350 square metre grocery downstairs, and offices upstairs, with a rental income of $186,644 per year

'It started at $2.5 million and it kept going all the way through, there was no hesitation', agent Mark Fragias of Ray White told Daily Mail Australia.

'Towards the end there were two potential purchases that were battling it out all the way through.'

He said the building was a great investment opportunity of a type that does occur often in Sydney.

'It is one of the sectors that is very tightly held.'

Ray White described the property as located on one of 'Sydney's premier retail strips which is exposed to extremely high levels of vehicles as well as passing foot traffic'.

'It is very close to the UNSW so because of the university students the sector does really well retail wise 

'There are very few vacancies thus pushing up the rental,' Mr Fragias said. 'There are talks of future rezoning, local council and state planning are looking at that area with a higher density.

'So you have a cocktail of very good returns plus a future scope for developed' Mr Fragias said.

The buyers were local investors who intend to leave the property unchanged, according to agen Mark Fragias

The buyers were local investors who are believed to want to keep the property as-is. It has a current rental income of $186,644 per year.

The 350 square metre store named 'Tokyo' Super - Fresh Food Plaza' features a cool room and bathroom on the bottom level, while the upstairs floor plan sees multiple office spaces and bathrooms.

Rear lane access along with at least three car spaces also come with the property. 

The two storey property sits in a central location near University of New South Wales and is in a prime location for public transport with a light rail along Anzac Parade. 

Mr Fragias said the result was life changing. 

'It had been in the family for a very long time, close to 35 years.

'The children sold it and they couldn't believe the result, they were blown away.'
