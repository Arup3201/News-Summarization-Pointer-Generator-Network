Andy Murray insists he did 'nothing different' in preparing for his Wimbledon quarter-final with Grigor Dimitrov, despite being heard directing X-rated rants at his own team.

Spectators and photographers heard Murray unleash remarks towards the players' box as last year's Wimbledon champion suffered a mini-meltdown on Centre Court during his straight sets loss.

The British No 1 barked 'shut the f*** up' and 'five minutes before the f****** match' in their direction, and Dimitrov claims he sensed all was not right with Murray before the game even began.

There has been no indication of what may have prompted Murray's remarks, although it is not unusual to have an outburst on court from the 27-year-old Scot.

Murray, watched from the Royal Box by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, said in his BBC Sport blog that the run-up to the match was as normal as ever.

'There was nothing different in the build-up and no reason to expect that kind of performance,' insisted Murray.

'The timings changed a bit because we played the quarter-final pretty early compared with some of my other matches, but my routine was the same and I practised with James Ward both days.

'I was nervous, I felt the butterflies and was excited about the match, but that's perfectly normal.

'I didn't feel overcome by the moment, but I certainly wasn't very good when I got out on court.'

Dimitrov, though, had an inkling that Murray was in a strange place ahead of the match: 'As soon as we started to warm up I sensed that his game was not at the highest level.'

The 23-year-old Bulgarian, asked why he felt that way, said: 'It's just a feeling. I have practised quite a few times with him and I know how he is striking the ball when he is at his best.

'I know how he is playing when he is not at his best. I felt something was a little different, and I just had to go with the flow.'
