Appeal: Omid Djalili, pictured leaving the Old Bailey, had a six month driving ban overturned

Comedian Omid Djalili had a driving ban quashed by an Old Bailey judge today after a police blunder over his insurance.

Djalili, 47, was caught illegally
 using a cycle lane to undertake cars on his moped and police officers 
thought the number of points on his licence rendered his insurance 
policy invalid.

The comedian was fined £2,900 and banned for six months by City of London Magistrates’ Court last September for driving without insurance.

But the Gladiator and Pirates of the Caribbean star launched an appeal against the charge of driving without insurance, which prosecutors did not contest, and his conviction was today overturned.

The judge, Mr Recorder Brian O’Neill QC, sitting with two lay magistrates, told the comedian: ‘That is the end of the matter.’

Djalili, who was allowed to sit behind his barrister in the well of the court for the 30-second hearing, replied: ‘Thank you, My Lord.’

The judge also ordered Djalili’s defence costs be reimbursed.

Djalili instructed Freeman and Co, the firm of solicitors headed by Nick ‘Mr Loophole’ Freeman, for the legal challenge.

Djalili found himself in court after he 
was stopped riding his Piaggio MP3 in Grosvenor Road, Pimlico, central 
London, on May 4 last year.

He illegally used a cycle lane to 
undertake cars while heading to the Vaudeville Theatre, where he was 
starring in Joe Orton’s play ‘What The Butler Saw.’

Djalili did not appeal the £200 fine for riding in a cycle lane - only the conviction for driving without insurance.

Police believed his insurance was invalid and impounded the moped and it took Djalili two weeks to get it back.

During the original magistrates’ court hearing, the entertainer asked to be spared a ban.

He said: ‘I have found myself being harassed and recognised on public transport.

‘If I don’t stop and take a picture with someone it can get abusive, which is distressing.

‘I also suffer terrible nausea on tour buses and let my crew go ahead and I follow in my car and my wife has a nervous disorder, which prevents her driving.’

Chelsea-born Djalili, whose parents are Iranian, added: ‘There is also a security issue.

'Coming from the Middle East and not being a Muslim I’ve had death threats and have always felt more secure when I am driving.’

Djalili, of East Sheen, southwest London, was cleared of driving a motor vehicle without insurance.

Outside court Djalili said: ‘This was never necessary, I would never drive without insurance.’

As he walked away from court raised his hands to the sky and shouted: ‘Tell the world.’
