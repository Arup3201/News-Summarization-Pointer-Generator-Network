Uruguayan president Jose Mujica has called FIFA 'a bunch of old sons of b*****s' in another attack on football's world governing body following Luis Suarez's lengthy ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.

The 79-year-old also described the Liverpool striker's four-month suspension from all football, plus nine international matches and a £65,000 fine, as a 'fascist ban'.

Mujica, who had said previously that Suarez was being punished by FIFA because of his humble background, continued his verbal assault at a reception for the Uruguay team after they returned home from the World Cup following their 2-0 defeat to Colombia in the last 16.

Asked by a journalist what his lasting memory of the World Cup would be, Mujica said: 'FIFA are a bunch of old sons of b*****s.'

The president then covered his mouth to feign shock at what he had just
 said, but when asked by the journalist if he wanted to rectify his 
comments, he responded: 'Publish it.'

Mujica 
then conceded that Suarez deserved to be punished for his bite on 
Chiellini during last week's World Cup Group D clash in Natal - the 
third such incident in the Uruguay striker's professional career - but 
criticised the severity of the ban.

Suarez has finally apologised to Chiellini after biting the Italy defender at the World Cup.

Despite initially denying he had deliberately bitten Chiellini, Suarez ended his silence from his home in Montevideo and issued a full apology to the Italian.

In a statement released on his personal website, which was then Tweeted by Suarez, he wrote: 'After several days of being home with my family, I have had the opportunity to regain my calm and reflect about the reality of what occurred during the Italy-Uruguay match on June 24, 2014.

'They could have punished him, but not given him this fascist ban,' added Mujica.

The Uruguay football federation has informed FIFA it will appeal against Suarez's ban.

On Saturday, it emerged that Suarez's defence against a charge of biting an opponent was that he lost his balance and hit his face on Chiellini's shoulder.

Those claims were dismissed by FIFA's seven-man disciplinary committee before imposing the punishment on the 27-year-old.
