Panesar was caught urinating on a bouncer in Brighton last year, while he received a suspended ban for 'potentially threatening and intimidating' behaviour in September.

Monty Panesar ran into more disciplinary trouble at the worst possible time when he was dropped by Essex just as England selectors prepare to pick their team to face Sri Lanka in the first Test.

Panesar was left out despite being chosen on Saturday to play against Glamorgan in the Championship when he failed to turn up for a team meeting yesterday morning after ‘forgetting’ that it had been scheduled.

Essex were quick to stress that they did not consider the matter to be serious. But it was the latest and most untimely example of Panesar’s ability to run into the sort of trouble which saw him sacked by Sussex last season. Graeme Swann’s retirement has left England in desperate need of a quality spinner and Panesar, at 32, remains the best specialist option when they meet on Wednesday to consider their options for Lord’s on June 12.

Yet he is likely to be pipped for a place by an all-round option in either Moeen Ali or Samit Patel with England as concerned as much by Panesar’s temperament as his ability to bowl out Sri Lanka on what is expected to be a flat pitch.

Dropped: Monty Panesar has been left out of Essex's LV=County Championship game against Glamorgan

Oops: The left-arm spinner had been tipped for a Test return by some but should miss out to Moeen Ali

The
 suggestion at the start of this summer was that the new England regime 
were prepared to forgive and forget the past misdemeanours of Panesar, who lost weight in the winter after staying on in Australia 
after the Ashes to work on his game.

Yet,
 the noises emerging from Chelmsford suggest Panesar has been a handful 
this season. He was warned by his new county about his body language in 
an early Essex match and had a row with Derbyshire’s Billy Godleman that
 led to him being told to calm down by the umpires in a Championship 
game.

He was replaced by the
 promising leg-spinner Tom Craddock yesterday and must smarten up his 
act if he is not going to squander the chance Essex have given him to 
rebuild a career of such achievement before Swann usurped him.

Meanwhile,
 the man who played one of the great one-day innings at Lord’s on 
Saturday in England’s narrow fourth one-day international defeat is 
adamant that he is not yet ready to be considered by England for the 
two-Test series.

Jos Buttler
 took England to within seven runs of their highest successful run chase
 in any one-day international on home soil with his sublime 121 from 74 
balls against Sri Lanka but does not expect to play in the first Test 
next week.

‘I am probably 
not ready for that,’ he said. ‘I average 32 in first-class cricket and 
my glovework needs to improve, too, if I’m to play in Tests. I’m 23 and 
have time to work on these things.’

England’s
 first choice remains Matt Prior and all will depend on how he comes 
through Sussex’s Championship match with Nottinghamshire at Hove where 
the England  vice-captain reclaimed the gloves yesterday.

Prior’s
 chronic achilles condition has kept him out of  four-day cricket ever 
since he scored a century for Sussex in their first game of the season 
and James Whitaker, the national selector, has insisted that England 
would not risk any player they deem not to be totally fit.

It
 now seems almost certain that, should Prior not be considered fully 
fit, England will turn to the man who remains one of the best 
wicketkeepers in the world in Essex captain James Foster.

Foster
 played the last of his seven Tests almost 12 years ago and his return 
now, at 34, would be a comeback almost as remarkable as Andrew 
Flintoff’s.

England look set
 to pick him ahead of Buttler and Craig Kieswetter, especially if they 
pick all-rounders in Moeen and Ben Stokes.
