A playboy billionaire racked up a whopping £2million bar tab in just three hours last night when he splurged on champagne and expensive jewellery.

The Russian businessman managed to spend the huge amount at a private nightclub in Mayfair.

He spent so much his bill for Luxor champagne alone reached £20,000, but staff at the Playboy Club's Salvatore's Bar waived his drinks tab.

But the mystery big spender in his mid-40s still left paying an eye-watering £2,042,520.

The seven-figure final total included £980,000 for Art Deco Asscher necklace, £356,000 for one diamond tennis bracelet and £109,500 for a second.

He also paid another £145,000 for an Emerald cut tennis bracelet and £111,600 for a pair of 14ct Pear Drop earrings.

And after splurging on the jewels at the Vashi Dominguez Fine Jewellery Salon Prive, the billionaire also had a colossal VAT bill of £340,420 to pay. 

Salvatore's Bar at the Playboy Club is described as 'sophisticated' and welcoming, and features a pianist and world-class cocktail mixer.

It not only boasts some of the most expensive bottles of champagne imaginable, but also claims to store a collection of rare vintage cognacs dating back to the 1700s.

When the wealthy Russian came to pay up at the end of the night, jeweller Vashi Dominguez picked up the tab for the 10 magnums of gold-flecked Luxor champagne he had ploughed through.

The luxury event saw models parading millions of pounds of diamonds and jeweller perused by guests - one of whom turned up in £1.4m Pagani Huayra that he parked outside.

One onlooker from the event said: 'The room had about 40 of the most wealthy men in London but this was still a huge surprise that just one of them spent over £2m in less than three hours.

'It was one of the most luxurious events I've ever been to, and all of the guests were billionaires - not millionaires, or multi-millionaires, the guest were the crème de la crème of London's wealthiest elite.

'There were some Arab royal families, Russians and very high net worth Europeans. There were as many personal bodyguards as there were guests.

'The models were milling in and out of the guests and when the drinks started flowing you could tell it was only a matter of time for one of them to drop a seven figure sum.'

'When the sale was done it was arranged very quietly and not at all in a showy way.

'The Russian simply gestured to his PA that he wanted the necklace and the bracelets worn by a particular model and the sale was arranged on the spot.'

When contacted a representative for diamond jeweller Vashi Dominguez said: 'Our Salon Prive event at the Playboy club was a hugely successful and enjoyable event, but it is our company policy not to comment regarding the identities of our customers.'

While most bar tabs pale in comparison to the jewellery binge at the Playboy Club last night, many other businessmen and celebrities have drunk bills that would make any normal person cringe.

In 2011 the Boston Bruins ice hockey team celebrated their Stanley Cup victory in style - by accumulating a £96,520 tab.

Reportedly the work of just six members of the team, the crew partied at the MGM Grand in Mashantucket, Connecticut with $34,916 worth of drinks before they bought a $61,603 bottle of Ace of Spades Midas Champagne.

At the time, the bottle was just one of six of the 30-litre bottles in existence that are made by luxury brand Armand de Brignac and produced by Champagne house Cattier. It is the largest bottle of luxury champagne in the world.

And in 2012 a self-proclaimed City whizzkid who spent more than £200,000 on Britain’s most expensive round of drinks also bought a bottle.

Alex Hope, 23, who claimed to have earned a fortune by trading foreign currencies, was said to have forked out £125,000 on a single bottle of champagne along with £60,408 on other beverages.

Mr Hope booked a table at the UnderGround night club at Liverpool’s Hilton Hotel and ordered the 30-litre bottle of Armand de Brignac in advance of his visit, according to bosses.

He was said to have entertained celebrity guests, including Manchester City footballer Adam Johnson and Man United star Wayne Rooney’s wife Coleen.

Two waiters were needed to carry in the bulky 99lb Nebuchadnezzar-size bottle of champagne, which is the equivalent of 40 standard ones.
