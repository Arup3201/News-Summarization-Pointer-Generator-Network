Oscar nominee Amy Adams' stellar Hollywood career and contented family life are a long way from the difficult childhood she endured.

It has been revealed that the actress was devastated at 11 years old when her parents Kathryn and Richard Adams divorced and her mother went to live with a lesbian lover. The young Amy left behind he Mormon upbringing and went to live with family friends.

The Adams married in a Mormon Temple in 1960 and lived in Castle Rock, Colorado. They later moved to Vicenza, Italy for Mr Adams' military posting where Amy was born.

The couple, who have seven children, moved back to Colorado when Amy was eight years old.

Sadly their marriage quickly fell apart. According to the National Enquirer, after the couple divorced in 1985, Kathryn Adams went off to live with a lesbian lover.

Mrs Adams, who was a semi-professional bodybuilder in her thirties, sought joint custody of her children but sole custody was granted to Mr Adams, who sang professionally in restaurants.

The father-of-seven - four boys and three girls -  quickly remarried.

Her parents' break-up appears to have deeply affected the young Amy, who left the Mormon Church soon after her parents divorced.

The actress has spoken about the values that her religious beliefs instilled in her as a child.

She said: 'The basic ''Do unto 
others...'' - that was what was hammered into me. And love.'

She moved out of the family home and went to live with family friends while in high school along with three of her siblings.  

A source told the Enquirer: 'They went to live with different family 
friends in the area for a couple of years because it was too much of a 
financial struggle for her father. Amy was heartbroken and cried herself to sleep at night.'

Amy Adams threw herself into the performing arts while attending Douglas County High School. She sang in the school choir and trained with a local dance company, with dreams of becoming a ballet dancer.

When
 she turned 18, Adams supported herself by working as a greeter at a Gap
 store while performing in community theater. Later, she worked as a 
hostess at Hooters. 

According to the Enquirer,
 Kathryn Adams was ordered to pay $25 a month for each of her young 
children but was served with a citation when she failed to do.

Happily
 for the Adams family, any rifts appear to have been 
mended in recent years. Kathryn Adams was pictured at the Oscars on Sunday where she appeared to be enjoying the party.

Kathryn Adams, who lives in Denver, Colorado, posted a picture on her Facebook page holding the Oscar won by Daniel Junge winner for short documentary Saving Face, along with the message: 'Sharing a proud evening with new friends. My lovely and talented daughter, Amy looked beautiful.'

When Amy received an Oscar nomination for indie flick Junebug in 2005, Kathryn Adams was working in a Starbucks and would tell all the customers about her daughter's success.

Amy Adams later told Vanity Fair: 'I was like, ''Mom, you cannot tell everybody 
who comes in to get a latte that your daughter is an Oscar nominee!'''

Her mother had previously said in 2008: 'I believe that her time will come. I believe with all my heart that she will win an Oscar.'

Last year, when her Hollywood star daughter received nominations for her role in The Master, Kathryn Adams wrote: 'I 
know it goes without saying,  but I am so proud of my daughter Amy for 
her accomplishments, her talent and tenacity which has earned her fourth
 academy award.  She looked gorgeous last night at the Golden Globes.  
The best thing though is she still remains a great daughter, sister, mom
 and partner.  Love her lots as I do all my wonderful children.'

Calls to Kathryn Adams went unanswered today.

Amy Adams also has some extremely proud siblings who take to social media to share her achievements.

Her brother Scott Adams posted a picture of his sister with the 
American Hustle cast on Facebook in January and wrote: 'What a day it is
 going to be. My daughter gets her braces off...picture pending, it is 
my Dad's birthday, and my sister Amy was nominated for an Oscar. 
Awesome! Oh, I also get to do laundry and dishes :o)'

Amy
 Adams, now 39, has been engaged to fellow actor Darren Le Gallo since 
2008 and the couple have a three-year-old daughter Aviana. The couple 
have been dating since 2001 after meeting in an acting class.

She said recently: 'I’m not pregnant. I’m not getting married anytime soon.'

Amy Adams acting career took off in 2002 when she was cast alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can.

She received her first Oscar nomination in 2005 for Junebug. Adams has gone on to star in Enchanted, The 
Boxer and last year's American Hustle which earned her another Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for Best Actress.
