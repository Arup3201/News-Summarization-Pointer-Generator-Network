Now you can write your name in the stars - and it is all thanks to members of the public.

With additional thanks to Oxford University, which five years ago set up the Galaxy Zoo project - a bid to get the public helping astronomers sift through the overwhelming influx of data pouring in from the far reaches of the universe.

The university uploaded over a million images of galaxies captured by telescopes such as Hubble, and then asked web-users to view and classify them according to their shape.

So far, 250,000 people have helped with 
the work, turning the data into a wealth of scientific knowledge - as 
well as a nifty web application that lets you spell sentences out using 
actual galaxies to form the letters.

And, as an additional bonus, as no-one has set eyes on these images before you, you are the first human to gaze at these far-flung places.

'I can see your house from here': The Galaxy Zoo team also have fun spelling messages in the stars

The Galaxy Writer has become a popular
and fun tool for both star-gazers and casual browsers, as well as 
serving as a promotional tool for the endeavour.

But
beyond spelling on an intergalactic level, the process is helping to 
classify spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and many irregular-shaped
ones, including, according to the researchers, one which looks like a 
penguin.

The 'Penguin' galaxy: This shape was possibly formed when two galaxies collided

From today, the site includes more another 250,000 new images of galaxies, most of which have never been seen by humans.

Galaxy Zoo principal investigator Dr 
Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, said: 'We’d like to thank 
all those that have taken part in Galaxy Zoo in the past five years.

'Humans are better than computers at pattern recognition tasks like this, and we couldn’t have got so far without everyone’s help.

'Now we’ve got a new challenge and we’d like to encourage volunteers old and new to get involved.

'You don’t have to be an expert – in fact we’ve found not being an expert tends to make you better at this task.

'There are too many images for us to inspect ourselves, but by asking hundreds of thousands of people to help us we can find out what’s lurking in the data.'

Among the spiral and elliptical 
galaxies that the volunteers have characterised and classified, they 
have found an entire alphabet of galaxies.

Galaxy
Zoo team member Dr Steven Bamford of the University of Nottingham has 
created a website at www.mygalaxies.co.uk where anyone can write their 
name in the stars.

The team are also keen to add more animals to the volunteers’ celestial zoo, having found a convincing penguin-shaped galaxy.

ABC as easy as 123: Scientists are also finding irregular shapes in the skies, caused when galaxies collide

Along with the quirky appeal of such findings, the researchers suggest such unusual formations may also tell us something about what happens when galaxies collide.

The new images on the Galaxy Zoo site come from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a ground-based telescope in New Mexico, and from large surveys with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.

Astronomer and Galaxy Zoo team member Kevin Schawinski from ETH Zurich in Switzerland said: 'The two sources of data work together perfectly: the new images from Sloan give us our most detailed view of the local universe, while the CANDELS survey from the Hubble telescope allows us to look deeper into the universe’s past than ever before.'

The team are hoping that the hard work of volunteers on the new site will allow data from the two telescopes to be compared, offering insights into how nearby galaxies as we see them today may have arisen from how the universe looked in the past.

Dr Karen Masters from the University of Portsmouth, another team member, said: 'In astronomy, we’re lucky enough to get to see both the past and the present of the universe.

'By comparing the two, we can try to understand the forces which have shaped the formation of the galaxies in it, including our own Milky Way.'

If you classify a galaxy on the website, you are probably the first sentient being to gaze at the billions and billions of stars within
