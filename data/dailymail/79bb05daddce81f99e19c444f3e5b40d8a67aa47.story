This is the heartbreaking moment a mother wept over her daughter's hospital bed after the four-year-old was found unconscious at the bottom of a holiday swimming pool.

Kate Miller says she is living every parent's 'worst nightmare' as she helplessly watches doctors battle to save her daughter Cally Simpson in a Barcelona hospital.

Cally was found unconscious at the bottom of a swimming pool on Monday during her first holiday abroad at the Villa Marina resort in Salou, Catalonia.

Tragic: Kate Miller tearfully kisses her daughter Cally Simpson, four, who is fighting for life after she was found at the bottom of the pool on her first holiday

After being rushed to a children's hospital she was placed in an induced coma amid fears of severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen.

Mrs Miller said: 'This is every parent's worst nightmare. I just want to swap places with my girl and make everything OK for her.'

The girl, from Arbroath in Angus, Scotland, had
 gone to the pool with her father Steven and grandmother when she is 
thought to have fallen in earlier this week.

She was pulled unconscious from the pool by another tourist and attempts were made to resuscitate her.

Her
 mother, who was at home in Scotland at the time of the tragedy, fought 
her way through a strike by French air traffic controllers to get on a 
flight to join distraught relatives at her bedside.

She said: 'Thank you so much to everyone who has taken time out to pray for our wee girl also to all your kind words.

'Can I ask you all to keep praying as Cally is still in critical but stable condition.

'There
 has been a wee bit of improvement as Cally has been given protein - 
still makes no change as we need these scans done Sunday or Monday.

'Thanks again to all you lovely people as all your messages are keeping us going.'

But despite their best hopes, the child's father said doctors had told them to prepare for bad news.

Steven
 Simpson said: 'The doctors have just spoke to me and Kate and have told
 us to prepare ourselves as our baby could be brain dead.

'They
 are going to start taking her off one medication in the next 24 hours 
and if she has another seizure it's really bad and that means her brain 
won't wake up.

'Please god help us wake our baby up. Please.'

Cally
 had been to see the dolphins Aquopolis Water Park in Salou earlier in 
the day and was planning to visit the zoo before the incident.

Fears: Cally may have been filling up her bucket in the pool as she played with her younger cousin when she fell, according to her aunt Debbie who was there

She was found by another British tourist and efforts were made to resuscitate her at the scene.

Her
 aunt Debbie Robertson, 27, who was staying at the same hotel said: 'I 
just want her to wake up so I can take her to the beach with her bucket 
and spade.

'We are all absolutely crushed, but we are hoping and praying that she will get better.

'She
 really wanted to do two things, go and see the dolphins and go to the 
zoo. We went to see the dolphins the morning of the accident, but we 
didn't get to go to the zoo.

'She
 is such a crazy, happy little girl, always happy, smiling and bossing 
people about. We are so grateful to Ash who rescued her.

'We owe him so much. She is in a stable condition and she is getting colour back in her cheeks.'

Cally was playing with Debbie's 22-month-old son, Darren, just before the accident happened.

'We think she was trying to fill her bucket up by the side of the pool,' said Mrs Robertson.

'She might have slipped in but we're just not sure exactly what happened.

'I remember someone was screaming and the next thing I saw she was being pulled out of the pool.'

Speaking out about the tragedy, her distraught grandmother said they still did not know how the youngster ended up in the pool.

Wendy Simpson, also from Arbroath, said: 'This was her first ever holiday. She can't swim.

'We
 are all praying that she will pull through. There has been a slight 
improvement. They have started to raise her temperature to 36.5 degrees.
 She is now stable.

'We were all there, but we don't know what happened.

'The last time we saw her she was walking behind her dad to the main building. We have no idea how she came to be in the pool.

'A man called Ash found her after a couple of minutes in the pool, I don't know his full name.'

A Facebook page, Saving Cally Simpson, was set up to raise funds to pay for Kate's travel costs and now has more than 1,500 supporters.Â 

Messages of support have flooded in on the site and Cally's family have been adding to the page to update people about the young girl's condition.

And Louise Cargill wrote: 'Come on cally auntie lous needing to see that cheeky smile love u loads xxxxx.'

Family friend Koula McCracken said the whole of Arbroath is praying for Cally.

She said: 'Everyone is praying for Cally to pull through. We all did a whip round so Kate has money when she is in Spain. Kate is an amazing mum and Cally is her world.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national in Spain. We are providing consular assistance.'
