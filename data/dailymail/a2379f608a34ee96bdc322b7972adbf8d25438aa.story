'Insects are a great sustainable form of protein,' says the Resort's Head Chef, Matt Jenkins

Head chef Matt Jenkins commented on his creepy creations, saying: 'Not only does our insect inspired menu add a spooky element for kids, it also remains topical at a time where alternative forms of nutrition are so popular.

'With some ingredients with up to 60 per cent protein, insects are a great sustainable form of protein, opening little peepers to little creepers as a new and unusual method to finding alternative sources of nutrition. We can't wait to see what our guests make of the spook-tacular dishes.'

Chessington's Howl'o'ween event also offers two new walk-through attractions, two new Halloween shows, rides in the dark and a daily fancy dress competition for young guests.
