Julie Bentley warned young girls must be taught about pornography 

The leader of the Girl Guides has urged parents and teachers to start informing young girls about pornography. 

Julie Bentley, the leader of GirlGuidingUK warned that if myths surrounding sex are not dispelled, youngsters will grow up thinking representations of intimacy in pornography are realistic. 

Her comments come days after it was revealed that children as young as seven face playground sexual taunts. 

Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Desert Island Discs, Ms Bentley - who, predictably, chose Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves as one of her records - spoke of the dangers of easily accessible porn. 

'When I was a teenager, I wasn't aware of pornography. 

'Today, regretfully, pornography is so accessible on social media that my view on this is that it isn't going to help them by pretending it's not there. 

'If they're accessing it and seeing it, then we have the responsibility of telling them that isn't a true representation of a relationship between two people,' the Sunday Telegraph reports. 

Ms Bentley added she had grown frustrated with preconceived ideas of feminists as women who hate men. 

'Some people like to interpret (being a feminist) as "she hates men"... I'm actually pretty happy with the world and love men.' 

Last week a survey carried out among Girl Guides found that children as young as seven felt subjected to sexual taunts in the playground. 

Almost half of those aged between 11 and 16 who took part in the annual Girl Guides Attitudes Survey said that teachers had dismissed complaints of sexual harassment. 

Chief Denise King said: ‘This shocking research shows we must act to stop sexual harassment being normalised by our society.

‘We want to ensure all girls live in a safe, fair and equal society that lets them reach their full potential. 

Seven out of 10 girls aged between 13 and 16 said that those who reported incidents of sexual harassment risked being bullied or teased (file image)

'We’re calling on all politicians to take a stand.’

Earlier this year the organisation launched a manifesto demanding compulsory school lessons in body confidence. 

The historic youth movement for girls said it was making its intervention into politics because ‘young women still believe they are too often treated like second-class citizens.’

Claiming that three quarters of teenage girls believe sexism affects most areas of their lives, the Guides said that there is ‘overwhelming evidence of inequality for girls in the UK.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged his support for the movement’s Girls Matter equality campaign.
