Flick through the TV channels on a Saturday morning, and it seems almost every one is showing a cooking show of some kind.

However, finally there is one with a difference - it's hosted in space.

Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield today posted the first episode of his new show, called 'Chris Hadfield's Space Kitchen' - although the first recipe, a tortilla filled with honey and peanut butter, may not be to everyone's taste.

Scroll down for video

First, get your ingredients: Chris Hadfield's latest video from the International space station reveals how astronauts create snacks in orbit. Here, he collects everything for a honey and peanut butter tortilla

Keep your eye on the prize: At one point Hadfield's torilla spins off screen and has to be retrieved, showing the issues of preparing food in zero gravity

'In the early days of space exploration, food was mostly squeezed out of tubes,' said Hadfield in the video.

'But now, we have all kinds of things we eat on Earth.'

However, he reveals there are some banned foods - including sandwiches.

'For sandwiches, we substituted bread for tortillas - here, crumbs just float away,' he explained.

'Our tortillas are packaged and last for 18 months.'

Hadfield shows viewers how to make a tortilla filled with peanut butter and honey.

He reveals that some items, such as honey jars, can be attached to surfaces using velcro to stop them floating away.

However, others can also cause problems - as he demonstrates when a rogue tortilla floats away from him during the demonstration.

During the demonstration he also reveals an interesting fact about honey on board.

'The bubbles stay in the middle of the bottle, as there's no gravity', he explains.

He also reveals that when eating food such as peanut butter and honey, astronauts can easily get messy.

However, as there is no running water on board, they have to use disposable wipes to clean themselves up after each meal.

The video is the latest in a long line of online picture, messages and videos from Hadfield, who has been taking advantage of the station's internet connection to share his mission via Facebook and Twitter pages.

He is expected to post more episodes of his fledgling space cookery show.

NASA recently revealed what astronauts have eaten throughout its space programme.

They showed the transition from the meat paste Yuri Gagarin, the first man in 
space, sucked from a toothpaste tube to the gourmet meals astronauts 
currently enjoy.

The 
pictures were posted on the space agency's website by NASA's Space Food 
Systems Laboratory, where the agency researches, tests, and produces 
food fit for consumption outside of the Earth's atmosphere.

Stellar cuisine: NASA have released photos chronicling the evolution of the food eaten in space. Pictured is a tray of food eaten on the Skylab, America's first space station, from 1973 - 1974

Appetizing: Food from the Apollo missions from 1968-1972 was carefully vacuum-packed and balanced for nutrition but was not exactly gourmet
