It may look like the most amazing sporting event ever seen, but in fact this Russian cosmonaut is helping protect himself by throwing a metal ball into space.

During a six hour spacewalk, station commander Gennady Padalka and flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko launched the 9kg ball into orbit to help researchers on earth track space debris.

They also installed a series of shields to protect the International Space Station from debris.

The satellite, which is expected to 
remain in orbit for about three months, is intended to serve as a target
for Russian engineers working on computer models that evaluate orbital 
tracking.

It should help them understand how objects move through space, and improve the tracking of the thousands of pieces of debris that litter space.

The two veteran cosmonauts sailed through the six-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station on Monday to prepare the orbital outpost for a new module and better shield its living quarters against small meteorite and debris impacts, officials said.

Station commander Gennady Padalka and flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko opened the hatch on the station's airlock at 11:37am EDT (1537 GMT) to begin a spacewalk to relocate a construction crane, install debris shields and release the small satellite into orbit.

The sphere is sent into space using a bizarre 'space lacrosse' system developed by Russian engineers.

Their departure was delayed about an
hour while engineers assessed a leak between the Pirs docking module 
and Russian segments of the station, a $100 billion laboratory for 
microgravity experiments and technology testing that flies about 250 
miles (400km) above Earth.

But the issue was resolved and the experienced spacewalkers more than made up the lost time.

Padalka, who was making his ninth 
spacewalk, and Malenchenko, on his fifth, moved a hand-operated, 46-foot
(14-meter) crane, called Strela-2, from the outside of Pirs to Zarya, 
the cornerstone of the station.

Pirs is due to be detached from the station next year to make room for a new Russian laboratory and docking module.

The United States completed construction of its part of the outpost last year and retired its three space shuttles. Europe, Japan and Canada also are partners on the project.

With the crane in place, the spacewalkers then used a hand tool to launch a 20-pound (nine-kg) spherical satellite on a path behind the space station.

'Nice throw,' a flight director in the Russian mission control centre outside Moscow said through a translator monitoring radio communications with the cosmonauts.

The sphere is seen spinning off into distance over earth, where it will be monitored by researchers on earth to improve the accuracy of tracking space debris.

The spacewalkers' last major task was to install five debris shields to the outside of the Zvezda module, the crew's primary living quarters.

They also retrieved a briefcase-sized experiment that has been exposing various materials to the harsh environment of space and installed two support struts on a ladder.

Padalka and Malenchenko returned through an airlock and shut the hatch at 5:28pm EDT (2128 GMT), completing the 163rd spacewalk for station assembly and maintenance.

On Aug. 30, Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, both station flight engineers, are scheduled to make another spacewalk to replace a power relay unit on the station's truss, set up power cables for the Russian laboratory module scheduled to launch next year and install a thermal cover on a docking port.
