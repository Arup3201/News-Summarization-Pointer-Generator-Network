The majority of Brits enjoy their first alcoholic drink within an hour of checking into their hotel on holiday, according to a study.

Thirty-seven per cent of travellers said they only wait 60 minutes before grabbing a beer or a cocktail after arriving at their accommodation.

A further 19 per cent admit to having their first ‘holiday tipple’ before they’ve even boarded their flight at the airport in the UK.

While 11 per cent of holidaymakers drink an alcoholic beverage during the flight en route to their destination, the survey by www.sunshine.co.uk revealed.

The online travel agency quizzed more than 2,000 British adults who had been on holiday abroad within the past year.

Nine per cent of those taking part in the poll admitted that they arrived to their last overseas holiday destination drunk, whilst 54 per cent said that they drank alcohol daily on their last holiday trip abroad.

Some sixty-five per cent of travellers said they drank more alcohol in a typical week on holiday than they did when back home in the UK.

When asked how much more, the average answer was five times more, with the average Brit spending an extra £110 on booze. 

Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘For many people, thinking of a holiday immediately conjures up images of sangria, cocktails and ice-cold beers by the pool. 

‘However, it seems that drinking alcohol on holiday is a costly exercise for those who don’t have such luxuries included in the cost of their booking. 

‘People should pace themselves and always drink responsibly.

'It’s easy to get carried away, but drinking alcohol in a hot climate must be done with caution as it’s likely you’ll be more dehydrated than usual. 

‘Nobody wants a horrible hangover or a drunken trip to A&E when on vacation!’
