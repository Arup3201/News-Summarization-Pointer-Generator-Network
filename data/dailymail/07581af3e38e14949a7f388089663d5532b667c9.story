Cheerleaders for the Dallas Mavericks have upped their game with new, even more revealing outfits.

On Monday night, the cheerleading team took to the basketball court for the half-time show wearing short, white spandex dresses with cut-out panels. 

Although skimpy outfits are run-of-the-mill for women who perform the daring and athletic routines at professional sports games, the briefness of the Mavericks new ensembles could raise some eyebrows.

The costumes bring the Mavericks on par with other cheerleaders in the same Texas city - the Dallas Cowboys' dancers, who are known for the briefness of their hemline.

The attention-grabbing get-up has paid off  - the Dallas Cowboys' cheerleaders have become famous in their own right and have their own reality TV show on the CMT network.

Despite the Mavericks' prominent public profiles - up to 16,000 fans have been known to attend games at their home stadium in Texas - the financial reward is somewhat lacking. They are paid a flat rate per performance.

Most of the Mavericks' dancers - a commitment which can involve three practices and three games a week - have other careers. Although some of the women are professional dancers, others work as elementary school teachers, radiologists and sales girls.
