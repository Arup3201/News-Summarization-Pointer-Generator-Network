More than two decades ago, he forced his way into the England team. But now, David 'Syd' Lawrence is bossing the over-40 bodybuilding scene.

The former England bowler is best remembered for an agonising injury in his delivery stride in New Zealand 1992 that saw his left knee cap shattered, him screaming in agony on the floor and his cricket career done for.

But the 50-year-old is back in sporting action, posing and parading his bronzed physique.

The former right-arm fast bowler was recently crowned the National Amateur Body Building Association's West of England champion for the over-40s category, and told the Daily Mirror he's taken to the tough regime.

'I went to a competition in my mid-40s with a friend of mine who was competing and I looked at the people on the stage and I thought, "I can do this",' he says.

'But after turning my hand to it, I discovered the hardest part wasn’t the weights and training in the gym, by far the toughest part was the 14 weeks of dieting before competition.

'It is the toughest thing I’ve done mentally and physically and that is the difference between guys who want to get big and look good, and guys who are serious body-builders and want to compete.' 

Former Gloucestershire paceman Lawrence admits the dark days surrounding his injury may have seen him go 'through a bout of depression' but he is thankful he survived what turned out to be the toughest period of his life.

'It wasn’t something that was as understood as it is now, but it was a dark place,' he continues. 

'Something had been taken away from me and I couldn’t understand why. I got very low and was left wondering, "what do I do now?"

'Eventually I realised that I just had to get on with my life. I became a bit of an ­entrepreneur and I’ve got no complaints at all, I’ve been very lucky really.'
