Tormented: Jordan was bullied mercilessly at school and even had to move because of it

He's the Michael Bubl√© tribute act turned Mr England singing sensation but life hasn't always been smooth sailing for Jordan Williams.

The 25-year-old has revealed that he was bullied while at school and that his experience is the reason for his insistence that proceeds from his new Christmas single go to an anti-bullying charity.

Now the campaigner is calling for the Government to take action against sites like Ask.fm and says he was horrified by the suicide of Loughborough schoolgirl Hannah Smith, 14, who committed suicide after being abused online.

'It does just show how powerful these sites can be,' said Williams in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'When such things have happened and continue to happen,
 I certainly do think they should be investigated and discussed - at the 
very least heavily supervised.

'Kids are very vulnerable, some more than 
others, and these kind of sites can provide an opportunity for bullies to hurt 
people anonymously so I personally feel they do more 
harm than good and absolutely need to be investigated.'

Campaign: Jordan Williams, a.k.a Mr England, hopes his new single will make a difference to bullying victims

Williams also spoke of his own experience of bullying and spoke of his hurt at being picked on at school, although he adds that he's now moved on.

'My experience was the same as most other kids in the same situation really,' he explains. 'I was made to feel very unwelcome by certain people through that time and like many other kids found it difficult and very uncomfortable to the point where I didn't want to be there or be part of the school.

'In the end I moved school because of it,' he says, adding: 'It's the best move I ever made.'

And what would he do if a young 
friend came to him and revealed that they were being bullied? According 
to Williams, letting them know that help is at hand is crucial.

'I would sit down with them offer to help and tell them there is help out there and that you can overcome it,' he explains.

Living the dream: Despite the bullies doing their worst, Jordan went on to become this year's Mr England

Festive: Mr England, a.k.a Jordan Williams, is to release a charity Christmas single called Here We Are

'I would suggest they
 talk to someone, if not a parent, a teacher or a connections 
officer, and someone will help you.'

He adds: 'Bullying doesn't have to wreck your life and it
 can be beaten and overcome but the most important thing is to talk to 
someone.'

Now, he hopes that his Christmas single, entitled Here We Are (Merry Christmas), will help children being bullied overcome their tormentors and start enjoying life again.

'I think the Government could perhaps do 
more,' he adds. 'I think there is help for kids but bullying is something that can
 affect a person for their whole lives so of course there's no such thing
 as enough investment.

'I'm really hoping people get behind [the song] so we can all try make a 
big difference and help as many kids in similar situations as possible 
and, who knows, hopefully prevent tragedies like Hannah Smith from happening again.'

Here We Are (Merry Christmas) is out now and all proceeds will go to Harborough Against Bulling. The track can be downloaded from iTunes for 79p.
