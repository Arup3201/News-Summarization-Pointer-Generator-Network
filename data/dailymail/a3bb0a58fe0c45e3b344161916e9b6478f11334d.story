A woman whose estranged husband allegedly pretended to be a medic to lure women to his home for invasive medical exams that he secretly filmed discovered evidence of the sickening scam as she searched for Christmas decorations, police have revealed.

Kimberly Gavin-Anderson uncovered a trove of medical pamphlets, supplies, small surveillance cameras and questionnaires filled out by David E. Anderson's victims and contacted police.

It came after she had already tipped off authorities after finding nude images of her nieces, aged 10 to 13, on his computer in a  folder entitled 'Family and Friends', police said.

The images were taken as the unsuspecting young girls 
used a bathroom at Anderson's beach house in Salisbury, Massachusetts over the summer.

After that report, Salisbury police obtained a
search warrant for his computers and, with the help of FBI and state 
police, allegedly uncovered 'thousands' of video of the girls.

In searching the home, 
police also found two external hard drives that contained videos of the 
'medical examinations' with time stamps as early as 2008, Chief Tom Fowler told the Boston Herald.

The father-of-one is being held on $500,000 bail following his arraignment on Monday on charges of unlawfully recording a nude or 
partially nude person and possession of child pornography.

Anderson allegedly recruited women through Craigslist and distributed  fliers through the community offering to pay between $25 and $50 to be examined by medical students for research, the Newburyport Daily News reported.

But Anderson said that, as part of 
the process, the women would need to undergo a 'baseline internal 
examination' first. Police said this included digital probing and other 
personal acts.

Authorities say he may have lured more than 20 unsuspecting women to his beach house as part of the scam over several years.

And as part of the act, Anderson allegedly bought medical devices including as a blood pressure monitor, latex gloves, lubrication jelly and a stethoscope.

'I’ve never seen anything this bizarre,' Fowler said of the crime.

For his beach home, he allegedly bought pin-sized cameras and set them up throughout the house.

Police said he is being investigated 
in other states, including Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
York and Washington, for similar alleged crimes.

On the prowl: He allegedly posted ads for women on Craigslist and handed out fliers in the community

Authorities were able to track down one 30-year-old victim who said she 
was handed a flyer in New York City and believed the examination was 
legitimate. She was paid $50.

He is accused of possessing child pornography on at least one computer, as well as the images of his four young relatives 'in various states of undress'.

His court-appointed attorney said his bail was excessive and his client is not a flight risk.

Additional charges stemming from his luring unsuspecting women into his 
beach house and secretly videotaping them are likely to be filed, 
Essex County prosecutor Maura Bailey said.

Court documents revealed there was a 
history of domestic violence between Anderson 
and his estranged wife and a divorce filing was requested around September 2, Fox Boston 
reported.

They have a 13-year-old son together.
