A drunken thug who stamped repeatedly on a young woman's head aboard a crowded tram simply because she was dressed in goth-style clothes was today facing a lengthy jail term.

Kenneth Kelsall, 47, battered innocent Melody McDermott after he and his accomplice Gareth Farrar, 43, spotted her on the tram in Bury, Greater Manchester.

Kelsall first headbutted 22-year old Melody inside the carriage, sending her reeling across the floor.

She managed to struggle to her feet and kicked out at the tram doors but Farrar then bundled her into the corner as other passengers looked on in horror.

Kelsall then repeatedly punched Melody and viciously stamped on her head and face five times as she lay between two seats.

Farrar thumped Melody’s friend Stephen Stafford, 29, and aimed two punches at Melody before running off.

Melody suffered a fractured eye socket and swelling to her face and body and Stephen sustained a black eye and an ear injury in the attack on a Metrolink passenger tram near Bury, Greater Manchester.

The attack has chilling echoes of the killing in 2008 of Goth student Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was beaten to death by two teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashires simply because of the long dark clothing she was wearing.

At Bolton Crown Court, Melody dressed in long dark dress with lacy sleeves and dyed red hair and Stephen watched from the public gallery as a judge said Kelsall, of Cheetham Hill, Cornwood Close, Manchester and Farrar of Ellingham Close, Beswick, Manchester would facing prison terms over the vicious assault in October last year.

Kelsall pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was remanded in custody.

Farrar pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray and was granted bail.

Both men are due to be sentenced on July 2. Melody and Stephen were returning home from a night out in Bury and were on board a tram at the Metrolink platform when they were attacked by the two men.

Karen Brooks, prosecuting, said Farrar and Kelsall had 'worked together' in the attack - pushing the complainant into the corner of the tram and then turning on Stephen Stafford, punching him to the ground.

'He remembers getting kicked in the face,' said Miss Brooks. 'I understand, the complainant Mr Stafford, had quite a serious injury on his ear which required four stitches. Those injuries are more likely to have been caused by a kick than a punch.'

CCTV of the attack was shown to the court, which also includes footage of a third man with the accused.

Farrar’s counsel Stuart Duke said: 'There is no dispute on what has actually happened - simply the label we put on it. The co-accused approached the complainant inside the Metrolink tram and head butts her.

'She is then seen to get up and to be kicking at the doors. Mr Farrar pushed her violently into the corner and assaults the other complainant.

'Mr Farrar on video, it seems, swings two punches at the complainant, but whether they connected or not we will never know.'

'It’s an unpleasant incident, he’s certainly guilty of an affray for pushing the complainant violently out the way while he assaults the boyfriend.

'He can be seen swinging two punches against the complainant. But he is a man of 43 and effectively good character.'

Mr Duke said Mr Farrar wasn’t even on the tram at the point Kelsall was inflicting violence on Miss McDerott.

He added: 'His instructions were that he didn’t even know she had been head-butted.

'The co-defendant continues to kick the complainant - it is arguable to say that the main injuries were caused when my client wasn’t present.'

But Judge Elliot Knopf warned they could both face jail sentences and called the incident a 'dreadful assault'.

Referring to Kelsall he said: 'He comes in and head-butts her at some sort of speed and sends her flying. She gets up and kicks the door then two of them come in.

'There is a melee - that’s the only way I can describe it.'

'It seems clear from the video the person who actually perpetrated in the assault to the girl would have been Kelsall. But because this man came back in with Kelsall, there is an argument. We have all had to opportunity to see the disgraceful display.

'All the options will be kept open, including immediate custody. Anyone who saw that recording would be horrified by the events on that day.'

Both Melody and Stephen declined to comment on the attack until after the sentencing hearing.But at the time of the attack Det Con Simon Swann from Bury CID said: 'This was a completely unprovoked and violent attack on two people who were returning home from an evening out.

'They were left with serious injuries that have left them both in a lot of pain.'

The case was not prosecuted as a hate crime due to the style of their clothing but Sophie’s mum Sylvia Lancaster has campaigned to end intolerance and prejudice since her daughter’s murder.

Sophie was kicked and stamped to death by a gang who targeted her and her boyfriend Robert Maltby because they dressed in a Goth-style of clothes.

Brendan Harris attacked her when she begged him and four other drunken youths to stop beating her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, 22.

Her boyfriend survived the beating but Sophie died in hospital two weeks later.

At the trial into her death the court heard Harris, 15 and accomplice Ryan Herbert, 16, were so violent in their attack that when paramedics arrived at the scene in Bacup they couldn’t tell if Sophie was male or female.
