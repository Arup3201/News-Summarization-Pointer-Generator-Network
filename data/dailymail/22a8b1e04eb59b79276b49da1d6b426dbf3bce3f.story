Children’s health is being harmed because academies and free schools are allowed to opt out of serving healthy lunches to their pupils, one of the country’s top doctors has warned.

Professor Terence Stephenson believes that two million children are at risk of obesity because of the government’s divisive and ‘irresponsible’ policy.

Prof Stephenson, a leading paediatrician, is the chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) – the professional body for the UK’s 250,000 working doctors – also said that the schools were setting young people a bad example.

Academies and free schools are not obliged to comply with the same nutrient-based standards for pupils' meals as grant-maintained schools.

He told The Observer: ‘It's damaging children's health. Allowing children in academies and free schools to be exposed to unhealthy choices, unhealthy foods and unhealthy diets when there's still huge concern in this country about obesity in children is definitely a backward step.

'Too many schools have been allowed to withdraw from this excellent, evidence-based system.

‘It just doesn't make sense to have a “them and us” policy on something as important as school food. If it's the right policy for children in maintained schools, it's the right policy for all children. It's irresponsible to have a two-tier policy on this.’

It was in 2010 that Michael Gove, the education secretary, to grant exemption to academies from the standards, which were introduced by Labour after the television cook Jamie Oliver showed in his 2005 programme Jamie's School Dinners how much poor food was dished up in schools.

Last week, Oliver urged ministers to stop the ‘madness’ of fast food outlets opening near schools.

In 2013, the AoMRC issued a report on obesity with 10 key recommendations, Prof Stephenson said that he was ‘disappointed’ and ‘frustrated’ at the complete lack of progress on five of its suggestions including a crackdown on junk-food advertising and introduction of a 20% tax on sugary drinks to reduce consumption.

Linda Cregan, the chief executive of the Children's Food Trust, said that it believed every pupil should receive healthy, nutritious food while at school.

But the Department for Education dismissed Prof Stephenson's concerns. ‘There is no evidence whatsoever that academies and free schools serve less healthy food than council-run schools. It is utterly disingenuous and untrue to claim the academies programme is harming children's health,’ a spokesman said.

‘A survey by the Children's Food Trust found 99% of academies have voluntarily agreed to follow the food standards, even though they are not required to do so. By contrast many council-run schools – unlike the best academies – are failing to provide healthy options, instead continuing to serve fried food, fizzy drinks and pizza.

‘Instead of pretending there is a problem with a particular type of school, we should concentrate on improving food in all schools,’ the DfE spokesman said.
