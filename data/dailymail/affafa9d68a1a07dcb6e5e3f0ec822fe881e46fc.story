Victim: Police discovered Mohammed Taki's remains under the patio at the flat in leafy Fulham, west London, in February 2010 after receiving a tip-off

A flat owner made a deathbed confession to strangling a man whose skeleton remained buried under his patio for 12 years, an inquest heard today.

Police discovered Mohammed Taki's remains
at the flat in leafy Fulham, west London, in February 
2010 after receiving a tip-off.

The 53-year-old's body had been bound with tape and wrapped in a duvet cover before being buried under the concrete patio.

At the time, flat owner Roy Heath, 52, was a terminally ill patient at the Trinity Hospice in Clapham, south London.

Police interviewed him at the hospice and on
the fourth occasion 'he admitted he had in fact killed the man we 
discovered under the concrete area. He named that man as Mr Taki', Detective Sergeant, Robert Upham, said.

Mr Heath has since died.

Following the tip-off, police began a search of the garden 
using methods such as radar. They discovered the remains at the back of the house under a level of concrete.

DS Upham told West London Coroner's Court: 'The concrete was lifted. The search team dug approximately a foot-and-a-half under the soil.

'The first we discovered was an area 
of underlay which had been rolled. The underlay was exposed where we 
found what appeared to be a duvet cover.

Under the duvet cover were 
several wrapped bags which covered several remains.'

Mr Heath 'claimed he had strangled 
Mohammed Taki', he added, but he died 13 days later and police were able
to follow up investigations with him.

However, he was under the care of a 
psychiatrist before his death and had anger management issues and a 'compulsion to blame other people for his own failures.'

The inquest heard Mr Taki, who was born 
in Iraq and is believed to have been unemployed when he died, had last 
been seen on January 12, 1998, during a doctor's appointment.Â

It was discovered that he had three 
sisters living in Baghdad and one in Syria, but officers were not able 
to get enough DNA from them to forensically confirm the skeleton 
belonged to Mr Taki.

However, GP records showed he had 
complained to his doctor of back pain and the forensic anthropologist 
found evidence to fit this on the skeleton.

Police also showed photographs of the 
clothing found on the skeleton to a friend who had reported him 
missing and 'when he was shown a picture of the hat, he burst into 
tears.

'He was adamant that the hat we had shown him was that belonging 
to Mr Taki', DS Upham said, and the clothing Mr Taki was said to have been wearing was similar to that found on the skeleton.

Pathologist, Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, told 
the inquest the body was in the foetal position and adhesive tape was 
wrapped around his ankles.

Due to the length of time the body had been left, he said, 'regrettably the cause of death is given as unascertained.'

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner 
Alison Thompson, said: 'I think on account that there was an unlawful 
burial, it raises the issue of suspicion and makes it more likely that 
the cause of death is an unnatural one.

'From all the circumstances in which it was found, it is more likely to have been criminally mediated.'

There was 'some reliability' to be 
placed on what Mr Heath claimed had happened, she said, adding: 'All I 
can say is I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this was 
an unlawful killing.'

At the time two people were arrested and bailed on suspicion of murder, but no charges were ever brought.
