A young girl who was thought to be paralysed after being shot by a gang two and a half years ago now has feeling in both legs, it was claimed today.

Thusha Kamaleswaran was caught in crossfire when thugs attacked her uncle's shop in South London while she was playing in the aisle.

Doctors feared that she would never be able to move her legs again - but now a documentary reports that she has regained feeling, raising the likelihood that she might one day be able to walk.

Recovery: Thusha Kamaleswaran has regained the feeling in her legs after being shot by gang members

The remarkable recovery of the eight-year-old is documented in ITV's Tonight, which followed her around as she was treated in hospital.

In a heart-warming trailer for the programme, she is seen smiling as she is praised for the extraordinary progress she has made in her rehabilitation.

As a medic manipulates her foot, Thusha can now tell whether her toes are pointing upwards or downwards without looking.

The ITV programme also shows her reunited for the first time with the emergency workers who saved her life.

Carefree: The schoolgirl, then five, was pictured dancing in the aisles just before she was shot in March 2011

Thusha was hit in the chest and the bullet passed through the seventh vertebra of her spine.

Chilling CCTV footage showed the girl, 
then five, skipping and dancing in one of the aisles of the shop when she was shot in March 2011.

She lay slumped on the floor before relatives grabbed her and rushed her to safety at the back of the shop.

Thusha went into cardiac arrest twice, and had to undergo emergency surgery in the shop and in hospital.

She
was unconscious for a week and had to be kept on a life-support 
machine, while her parents were warned she had only a 50 per cent chance
of survival.

Jailed: Anthony McCalla and Kazeem Kolawole were two of the thugs convicted over the shooting

Gunman: Nathaniel Grant fired the shots which hit Thusha while targeting a rival gang

Nathaniel Grant, Anthony McCalla and 
Kazeem Kolawole were given life sentences at the Old Bailey in April 
last year for causing Thusha and shopper Roshan Selvakumar grievous 
bodily harm with intent.

They
were members of the Brixton-based OC (Organised Criminals) gang, and 
were targeting a member of their bitter rivals ABM (All Bout Money) when
Grant opened fire into the shop in Stockwell.

After the three men were sentenced, Thusha's mother Sharmila expressed disappointment that they might one day be released.

The family fled their native Sri Lanka because of the violence stemming from the country's long-running civil war - only for their daughter to be caught up in a gang battle in their adopted home.

Earlier this year, Thusha said: ‘I can’t wait until I can walk properly on my own again.

‘I’ve already taken some steps on the treadmill in my harness with my physio helping me. I want to dance around and play basketball with my friends.’

Despite her injuries, she has remained surprisingly independent and insists on helping her parents with the cooking and other household chores.

Courage In The Crossfire will be aired tomorrow at 7.30pm on ITV.
