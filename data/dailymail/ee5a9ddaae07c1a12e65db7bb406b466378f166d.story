A suspected illegal immigrant has been found clinging to the underside of a caravan on a busy motorway – as two more were found hanging from underneath a mobile home.

The incidents in Kent came less than 24 hours after another stowaway was discovered hiding in a woman's car as hundreds more tried to storm a ferry in the Port of Calais. 

Police were first called to reports of a person clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it travelled along the M20 towards London at 9.16am today.

Officers located the man hanging from the motorhome between junctions nine and eight, the section between Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, and arrested him at the scene.

Then Kent Police found another two men clinging to the underside of a mobile home, they said today.  

@kentpoliceroads tweeted: "2 further males detained for illegal entry to UK after hanging from underside of another mobile home-Handed to Home Office officers."

The details of the circumstances of the discovery in both incidents were not clear.

It comes just hours after another man was arrested in Shepherdswell, Kent, on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant after he hid in the back of a woman's car as she travelled through the Eurotunnel from France to Britain.

It is understood the latest discovery was made after police attended an unrelated report of a caravan overturning in the area.

The caravan which was unknowingly carrying the immigrant was being driven along the motorway towards London from the Channel Tunnel.

The man was detained by police and has since been transferred to the Home Office Immigration Enforcement for them to take further action.

Yesterday, 59-year-old Sue Taber called police after discovering a man hidden in her car having driven from Spain to France and back to Britain via the Eurotunnel.

Ms Taber was shocked to find a human leg protruding from out behind the driver's seat after parking up outside her home following the 53 mile cross-Channel journey.

She said she noticed the stranger as she let her two dogs out of the car and said the 5ft 8in man, aged between 18 and 20, emerged from her vehicle shouting: 'I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan'.

Ms Taber, who believes the man got into her car while she left it briefly unattended and unlocked at Calais, France, admitted she had felt something nudging her back on her journey, but assumed it was just one of her dogs fetching a ball.

The stowaway was found in Ms Taber's car having got in while she left her car unattended in Calais, France

She believes the stowaway climbed into her Fiat Panda and hid behind the seat after she left it unattended and unlocked while she checked her two dogs in at the French port of Calais.

After making the discovery, she shouted at the stowaway 'in no uncertain terms' to 'get lost' before she went inside her home to dial 999 as he fled just before 9.30am. He was later located by police, arrested and transferred to the Home Office.

The two discoveries show the heightened desperation by illegal immigrants desperate to flee to Britain – with more than 250 storming a Britain-bound P&O ferry on Wednesday.

They tried to force their way on board the vessel at Calais and security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on them as they attempted to overpower officials.

Cross-Channel travellers are now being warned to stay alert when travelling through the French port, where more than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in as part of heightened patrols.

Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said today that the company's site at Calais was extremely secure but added: 'Everybody travelling through Calais should be vigilant whenever they leave their vehicle.'

The mayor of Calais also last night begged David Cameron to visit Calais to tell the waiting hordes that Britain was 'no El Dorado'. Natacha Bouchart said the UK was too soft on migrants.

Jean-Marc Puissesseau, of the Calais Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which runs the port, described the situation as 'unacceptable' and said the port is 'under siege'.

He said: 'I demand that the forces of law and order have a permanent presence at the port as quickly as possible.

'It is out of order what is going on. If it is not sorted out we must close the port.'
