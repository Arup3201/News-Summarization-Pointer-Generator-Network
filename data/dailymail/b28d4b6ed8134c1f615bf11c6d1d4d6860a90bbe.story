The Murdoch family are grieving the loss of Mr Murdoch's mother, Dame Elisabeth, who passed away at her home in Victoria at the age of 103 this week.

The media mogul said his mother, who died peacefully in her sleep at her home on Cruden Farm in Melbourne would be mourned by thousands of Australians who had been touched by her long life.

During the statement given by Mr Murdoch yesterday, on behalf of her extended family, he said: 'We have lost the most wonderful mother but we are all grateful to have had her love and wisdom for so many years.

'Throughout her life, our mother demonstrated the very best qualities of true public service.

'Her energy and personal commitment made our country a more hopeful place and she will be missed by many.'

Australian Prime Minister was among the first to pay tribute and offer her condolences to the Murdoch family.

She said: 'Her example of kindness, humility and grace was constant. She was not only generous, she led others to generosity'.

Wendi's relationship with Dame Elisabeth got off to a difficult start as Mr Murdoch's mother did not approve of his decision to divorce his ex-wife Anna Maria Torv Murdoch Mann.

Mr Murdoch married Wendi just a few weeks later in 1999.

'Rupert had a wonderful marriage to Anna, and it was a terrible thing to just end it,' Dame Elisabeth said on her 100th birthday.

'When you take a vow to be loyal to someone for all your life, you don’t hurt other people for your own happiness.'

However, she was successfully able to draw warring family members back together after the much-publicised divorce.

The
philanthropist and matriarch of the Murdoch family, was surrounded by 
her family at her home set on more than 54 hectares at Langwarrin in the
southeast of Melbourne.

Her family said details of a memorial service would be confirmed shortly, but her funeral is expected to be a private one.

Born Elisabeth Greene in Melbourne she
went on to marry newspaper publisher Keith Murdoch, 23 years her 
senior, in 1928 and inherited the bulk of his fortune when he died in 
1952.

Rupert's decision to 
divorce his long-term wife Anna and remarry 30-year-old Wendi Deng in 1999 also 
triggered a hostile reaction from Elisabeth.

Rupert's
£1.2billion divorce payout to the mother of his children Lachlan, James
and Elisabeth is the biggest in history.

She did not approved of his 
decision to divorce from his second wife Anna, mother to Lachlan, James 
and Elisabeth.

Rupert 
described her as 'the disciplinarian' but she was also determined to be a
role model for women and she caused a stir became the first woman 
trustee of the National Gallery of Victoria.

She once said: 'I'm not a feminist, but it's nice to show that women can be useful. And I've tried to be an example to my children – three of them daughters.'

She had an extraordinary life and was made a Companion of the Order of Australia, a Dame and Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

She also held an award from the French government for funding an exhibition of works by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin in Melbourne in 2002.

In Australia, she is not seen simply as Rupert Murdoch's mother, but is regarded as a national treasure after decades of charitable work and contribution to the arts.

According to the Murdoch-owned Herald and Weekly Times, she was known to have contributed to 100 organisations, including helping less fashionable causes: such as prisoners' welfare, children in care and mental health.

Her charity work earned her the Victorian of the Year award in 2005 at age 96. In January 2007, aged 97 and 11 months, she surpassed Dame Alice Chisholm as Australia's longest-lived dame.
