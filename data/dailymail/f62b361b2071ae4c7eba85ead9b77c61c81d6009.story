Survivors: Donna Lawrence has overcome her fear of dogs following a vicious attack by a pitbull thanks to her pet Susie

A pregnant woman who miscarried after a savage dog attack  has overcome  her fear  with the help of a puppy who suffered abuse at the hands of its last owners.

Doctors said Donna Lawrence was lucky to be alive after the vicious mauling by a pitbull left her requiring 45 stitches. With her leg ripped open to the bone, it would be another two months before she could walk after the attack in 2008.

The animal lover was left with a fear of dogs and even after her physical wounds had healed she said she suffered nightmares and struggled to cope emotionally.

But that all changed when she met young mutt Susie- who had a tragic tale all of her own.

In August 2009, the dog survived unspeakable animal abuse when her former owners set her on fire and left for dead in Greensboro, North Carolina. 

She was picked up ten days later by Guilford County Animal Shelter who began treating her for third-degree burns to 60 per cent of her body, a broken jaw and missing teeth.

On her blog, Donna wrote she had recognised a fellow survivor in Susie.

'You can see Susie and I shared something in common: she was a pit bull mix that had been had been tortured by a human and I was viciously attacked by a pit bull just a few months before we met.

'I forgave the dog for my wrongful attack, and Susie forgave the human for hers.'

Ms Lawrence was attacked in 2008 after she tried to help a neighbor's dog that she says was underfed and left chained up outside.

She began feeding the animal every morning until the fateful day the dog attacked.

'I will never forget that day,' added Ms Lawrence.

'My life flashed before my eyes as I found myself on the ground in the angry animal's jaws. He clenched my right leg between his teeth, and I knew that he could overpower and kill me. I tried with all my might but I couldn't loosen his grip.'

She grappled with the pitbull and was eventually able to escape to a neighbor's house where she collapsed.

Bleeding profusely from her leg and hand, she was rushed to the emergency room where she had 45 stitches. Doctors found the bites had penetrated her leg and left the bone exposed.  

Susie had a tragic story of her own, having been set on fire and left for dead by her former owners

Donna, who does not blame the pitbull that attacked her, said she had recognised a fellow survivor in Susie

Mrs Lawrence added: 'The doctor told me I was lucky to be alive. He said that most people either do not survive or lose a limb to attacks like this. I thanked God for saving my life.'

Despite the terrifying attack, Mrs Lawrence said she did not blame the dog.

'I blame the owners who turned their dog into what it was,' she added. 'Their neglect and abuse made their dog fearful and territorial.'

Understandably, Mrs Lawrence, who had been a big dog lover, was left scared and suffering nightmares from the attack until she and husband Roy decided to adopt Susie a year later. 

The pooch has since become a trained therapy dog who works with  burn victims.

Mrs Lawrence used her plight to highlight animal abuse  in North Carolina and in 2010, former Governor  Bev Perdue signed Susie's Law to bring in tougher penalties on animal cruelty.

Their extraordinary stories were turned into a film, Susie's Hope in 2013 starring Emmanuelle Vaugier as Mrs Lawrence.

Mrs Lawrence has since used Susie's story to successfully campaign for stricter penalties on animal cruelty in North Carolina
