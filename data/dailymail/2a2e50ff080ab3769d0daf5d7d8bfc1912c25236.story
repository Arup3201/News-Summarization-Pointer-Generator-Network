After displaying what school administrators are calling a 'gross exercise of poor judgement,' Florida teacher Courtney Spruill has been suspended without pay for 15 days after evidence surfaced of her having a wild party with members of the school soccer team.

Spruill works at Kernan Middle School as a soccer team coach and PE/Health teacher.

She was suspended effective immediately following a July 1 vote by the Duval County School Board.

Florida teacher Courtney Spruill has been suspended without pay after evidence surfaced of her having a wild party with members of the school soccer team

Action News Jax reports
 an investigation into the alleged incident came to light after a 
student approached a softball coach about throwing a party for the 
soccer team.

The event eventually happened in May at the house of a player's parents. 

A student later accused Spruill of drinking alcohol and twerking on the students.

Twerking was defined by the school district investigation as dirty dancing.

The district also allegedly viewed a cell phone video of Spruill receiving a lap dance from a student.  

The homeowner, who has not been identified, said Spruill brought vodka to the party as a gift, but only drank soda herself.
