Steven Gerrard took to Instagram on Sunday to deny any claims of a fallout between himself and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.

The Liverpool captain was dropped by Rodgers for the game against Stoke at Anfield on Saturday despite it being the 16th anniversary of his debut for the club.

Rodgers later claimed he wasn't aware of the landmark until he saw the commemorative match programme in the dressing room before their 1-0 win over Stoke.

Steven Gerrard posted on his Instagram account to reveal there had been no rift with Brendan Rodgers

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said he had had no idea it was the 16th anniversary of Gerrard's debut

Gerrard posted a picture on Instagram of him and Rodgers smiling together with the caption: 'Just to set the record straight, media talk of a fall out between us 2 is NONSENSE. Have a nice Sunday.'

The 34-year-old came on as a sub having been left out of the starting side against Stoke as Glen Johnson's 85th-minute winner gave Liverpool a much-needed win after three straight Premier League defeats.

After the game on Saturday, Rodgers played down suggestions of a rift between himself and the Liverpool captain after leaving him out of the team.

'I spoke to him (Gerrard) on Friday and he didn't mention it so I felt bad when I saw about 20 pictures on the programme,' Rodgers said.

'Steven is in a part of his career when he is not going to play every minute of every game.

'He played Palace and he played Ludogorets when he was outstanding and put in a huge amount of effort, and we have other players here who can come in and do a job and Steven understands that.

'I need to look at each game. We have good players that are fresh.

'He came on and gave a great contribution towards the end and his experience and stature in the game helped us at that point.'

Gerrard, who earns £120,000-a-week, is still talking to Liverpool about a new contract. There is no sign of a resolution yet but the player remains optimistic.

Manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed: ‘There’s no update I am aware of. I think the club is talking with Steven’s representatives.’
