The second son of Betty Colt, a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family, said his mother gave him a phone to hide in the back garden of his foster home in an attempt to kidnap him and his brother, a court heard today.

Bobby Colt (a pseudonym prescribed by the Children's Court), 16, appeared via audiovisual link in Moss Vale local court on Wednesday on the second day of a hearing into allegations that Betty  tried to recruit him to conspire in the kidnapping.

The pair were removed from her care after authorities found them living in squalor and exhibiting telltale signs of incest in the winter of 2012.

The court heard that Betty had given him her number by scrawling it in magazines that she passed over as gifts.

'It was in the books, in car magazines,' he said.

He also reaffirmed his 15-year-old brother Billy Colt's testimony that Betty, who had five of her 13 children removed from her, smuggled them a mobile phone and a charger at a contact meeting to arrange for an early morning abduction.

Bobby described how he concealed the phone in the back garden so he could continue planning the runaway with his mother.

He said he hid it 'out in the back in the bush...in a waterproof bag. So it doesn't get taken.

'I knew I had to stay (in care) until I was 18.'

He also said he discussed the 'plan', as it is being referred to in court, with his brother behind a closed door 'so nobody can hear us...I didn't want to get catched.'

Asked if the plan was his mother's, Bobby said: 'yes'.

According to Children's Court documents tendered in Moss Vale Local Court on Wednesday, Bobby Colt's parents are 'closely related'.

When he was found by authorities, 'his speech was not understandable...he had fungal infections...he needed urgent dental work.'

He was seen leaving the court this morning with his carer and puffing on a cigarette before being reunited with his brother Billy.

Betty Colt did not give evidence in the hearing and her LegalAid lawyer Phil Carey told court the defence case would be put forward by way of written submissions.

Final submissions must be filed by the police by 5 August and the defence will have a further week to prepare their case.

An urgent transcript of this week's proceedings was ordered by Magistrate Mary Ryan.

Bail for Betty Colt was continued, meaning she has to report to a NSW police station three times a week. She was also ordered to notify, in writing, detective sergeant Kirsty Hales and detective inspector Peter Yeomans of the state's child abuse squad of any plans to relocate her address.

The case was adjourned to 18 August for Magistrate Ryan to hand down her decision.

In Moss Vale local court on Tuesday, magistrate Mary Ryan heard that Billy said his mother Betty secretly opened up a line of communication that allowed her to plan the 'runaway', in an interview conducted with Billy Colt late last year and tendered in evidence by police.

'She hid the charger in my jacket,' Billy told the police in the interview.

'(Bobby) had the phone in his jacket, she hid it, she told him what it was...she planned a runaway with Bobby.

'Mum put the phone number on my iPod...under sticky tape.

'(She said) this is my number, give it to Bobby.'

The court heard allegations she snuck a mobile phone and charger as well as a copy of her telephone number to her sons during monitored visits, with instructions for their 'escape plan'

He told police the iPod - a Christmas present - had country music downloaded into it.

The evidence took on a chilling note as Billy described to police how his brother told him about the plan behind closed doors and with 'soft voices' to avoid detection.

'(Bobby) said don't tell anyone because we might get catched.'

The alleged plan - which police claim to have foiled - was for Betty to pick up her children between 2am and 4am one morning in a four wheel drive parked 'halfway down the road' from their foster family.

She was then going to take them to another location where they would be whisked away by their cousin.

Appearing via audiovisual link on Tuesday after the police interview was played to the court, Billy said he didn't want to be part of the plan because he knew it would land him in trouble with police.

'(Betty) said get up in time and come with me, mum was suppose to pick us up.

'I don't want to get in trouble, we wasn't allowed to leave...Mum said she just wants her kid back.'

Under cross examination by Betty Colt's lawyer, Billy was asked 'who started the talk about going away.'

He replied: 'mum'.

The adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional NSW in July 2012, are now under investigation for child abuse

Under the Crimes Act, Betty Colt faces up to 10 years behind bars if she is found guilty of recruiting a child to commit a crime.

In other proceedings last Friday, detectives took DNA swabs from Betty and her daughter Raylene Colt, as police gather evidence they hope will lead to charging a number of the family members with incest and other offences.

Warrants to arrest five other Colts were also issued, with most of the clan declining to turn up to court last week.

Investigators are yet to execute those warrants as it is understood the Colts are on the run across the country.

Detectives believe they have spread to at least South Australia and Western Australia.

A strike force made up of members of the NSW child abuse squad - spearheaded by detective inspector Peter Yeomans and detective sergeant Kirsty Hales - is pursuing the case that has been revealed as one of the most shocking acts of abuse in the country's history.

If Betty Colt is found guilty, her criminal conviction will be the first to arise from the investigation that has already rescued generations of inbred, illiterate and malnourished children from the reclusive family which lived in the picturesque hills of outback NSW.

In court Billy was asked why he was removed from the Colts.

'I think because we were living in motor homes,' he replied.
