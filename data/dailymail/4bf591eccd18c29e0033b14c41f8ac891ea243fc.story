West Brom have tabled a £5million offer for Leicester striker Jamie Vardy.

New Baggies boss Tony Pulis has identified the forward as potential signing this month as he seeks to beef up his attacking options.

And it is understood WBA have made an offer for Vardy, though the bid is understood to have been rebuffed.

Vardy, who can also play out wide, has scored just once for the Foxes this season, having struck in the famous 5-3 victory over Manchester United in September.

Pulis is keen to freshen up his his attack having taken over managerial duties from Alan Irvine this month - and will offload deadwood to help finance transfers.

The Baggies are willing to listen to offers for club record signing Brown Ideye, who Tony Pulis says 'has a cloud hanging over him at the moment'.

A move for Vardy could involve Brown Ideye leaving the Baggies, who has flopped at the Hawthorns this term

Ideye missed a glorious chance against Hull to justify some of his £10million fee and has looked bereft of confidence since joining from Dynamo Kiev last summer.

Pulis is determined to bring in a striker to share the goal burden on Saido Berahino this transfer window, and Ideye could leave to raise funds.

'I can't say he's staying,' said Pulis. 'If someone comes in and offers an enormous amount of money the club looks at it. That's the same with every player. Every club I've been at has worked that way.

Pulis will have more time to assess his attackers on Monday night when the Baggies travel to Everton to help wrap up the weekend's Barclays Premier League fixtures.
