'Attention seeker': Mathew Davis, 22, posted a message on the toilet door mid-flight so he could 'save the day'

A British Airways steward who wrote a bomb threat on a jet’s toilet door mid-flight so he could 'save the day' as a hero and get a promotion was jailed for six months today.

'Attention seeker' Mathew Davis, 22, was a member of the crew on the Boeing 777 flight from London to Tokyo with 150 passengers on board when he posted the message claiming there was a live bomb on the plane that was going to explode mid-air.

The note read: 'The bomb on board will explode at 16.00GMT unless our demands are met' and he showed it to terrified stewardess Sarah Jane Spencer when the plane was 35,000 feet over the Middle East.

She spent the rest of the flight checking her watch believing her time had come but in reality it was a hoax by Davis so that he could tell the captain and get a promotion.

Judge Anna Guggenheim QC, who noted it was 'highly dangerous behaviour', said: 'This is an extremely serious example of a bomb hoax.

'Several hundred people aboard a plane at high altitude is a common thing in our world but they are extremely vulnerable.

'You wanted to create a crisis in order to be seen to equip yourself well, to be seen well by your employers, to rise in the estimation of your employers, putting it shortly to be a hero.

'Had you been believed the extent of the chaos and disruption and fear would have been very great indeed.'

Davis 'found' the message and told the captain and Ms Spencer but luckily the 'highly experienced' pilot realised it was a hoax almost immediately.

Because of the captain’s 'good judgement' the plane did not make an emergency landing and 'hundreds of lives, international air traffic and emergency services' were not deployed but he still caused 'extreme fear' to his colleague, the judge noted.

explode at 16.00GMT unless our demands are met' and he showed it to

James O’Connell, prosecuting, said: 
'It was about 2.50pm UK time when the defendant asked for Ms Spencer’s 
her attention and said to her 'I need you to read the back of this 
door'.

'She went to where 
one of the loos was at the back of the airplane and discovered a message
 written on the back of the door which read 'The bomb on board will 
explode at 16.00GMT unless our demands are met'.

'She
 immediately said she was shaken and terrified and she actually did 
believe there was a bomb on the plane and she was constantly looking at 
the watch and checking the time.'

The
 captain had experienced similar hoaxes before and after liaising with 
security at Heathrow realised it was not a serious threat, even guessing
 one of the crew was responsible.

When they landed at the end of their 
7,000-mile journey on February 11 Davis was quizzed and asked to write a
 report. His handwriting matched that on the back of the toilet door.

Davis,
 whose mother committed suicide when he was younger, was taken off 
duties but only arrested when they returned to Heathrow. Police searched
 the jet, but no explosives were found on board.

Mr
 O’Connell said: 'He explained he was having some difficulty at work 
financially and he was hoping he might be able to get a promotion and he
 came up with the ill conceived idea that if he was seen to deal well 
with a crisis style situation it might help him with the promotion.'

When he pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at Isleworth Crown Court Judge Guggenheim noted he has a 'history of highly unusual acts which could be described as attention seeking, but which are potentially dangerous.'

Sam Bonner, defending, said that it was written so only staff would see it.

She said: 'It was done in such a way where he would be able to contact the captain and save the day. There was no intention to cause mass panic or terror to those on the plane.'

'What he ridiculously thought was that he would be able to notify the captain and be calm in the situation and deal with it well and therefore be looked on notably by his employers.

'This was an act where he attempted to appear heroic and wanted approval from his workplace.'

Judge Guggenheim said: 'He plainly in the future shouldn’t be employed by any airline or in any position of trust such as this.'

Davis, of Crawley, West Sussex, lost his job at BA after the hoax.
