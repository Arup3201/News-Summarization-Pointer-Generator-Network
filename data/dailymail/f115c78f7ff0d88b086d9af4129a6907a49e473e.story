Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's famous rose inking covering the whole of her behind has been voted the worst celebrity tattoo.

The X Factor judge beat her Girls Aloud bandmate Sarah Harding in a new poll of 1,000 people after fans described the £12,000 flower design as 'naff'.

Harding came second in the top 10 worst A-list tattoos for the huge phoenix inked on her back with the message: 'Don't Be Bitter - Glitter.'

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's large rose inking which is thought to have cost the singer £12,000 has been voted the worst celebrity tattoo ever 

Cheryl's tattoo was done by artist Nikko Hurtado (pictured with Cheryl left)  who said that the piece took hours and hours to complete - she showed the tattoo off whilst performing on stage in tight leggings (right)

In third place was the American actress Hayden Panettiere who was ridiculed over her tattoo saying 'Vivere senza rimipanti' which is meant to say 'To Live Without Regrets' in Italian. 

The Heroes actress - who recently gave birth to her first child actress - misspelled the phrase, adding an extra 'i' to the last word.

Fourth place in the poll went to David Beckham for the incorrect spelling of his wife Victoria's name in Sanskrit. The footballer's tattoo, when translated, says 'Vihctoria'.

Fifth place went to Katie Price who got a new tattoo to cross out the first name of her former husband Pete Andre following their split in 2009, leaving an ugly looking black mess on her arm.

3 Heroes actress Hayden Panettierre for her misspelt 'Vivere senza rimipanti' tattoo - Italian for 'To Live Without Regrets.'

4 David Beckham for his misspelling his wife Victoria's name in his Sanskrit tattoo.

5 Katie Price for simply crossing out ex-husband Peter Andre's first name in a tattoo after their 2009 split.

6 One Direction singer Zayn Malik for his tribute to his Little Mix girlfriend Perrie Edwards.

7 Melanie Griffith for her Antonio tattoo on her right forearm in tribute to Antonio Banderas - they split up last year.

8 Angelina Jolie for her tattoo dedicated to her then husband Billy Bob Thornton. They divorced in 2003 and Angelina has since had the tattoo removed.

9 Tulisa Contostavlos for her cringeworthy 'Lucky You' message just above her bikini line.

10 One Direction's Louis Tomlinson for his 'Cup of Tea' design in tribute to the boy band's hit, Little Things 

The sixth least popular tattoo was One Direction star Zayn Malik's tribute to his Little Mix star fiance Perrie Edwards.

When Zayn got the comic book style tat he reportedly spent the whole time chatting about Perrie who he has been dating officially since April 2012. 

Seventh place on the list of offensive inkings was Melanie Griffith for her Antonio tattoo - her embarrassing tribute to her now ex-husband Antonio Banderas.

And it seems Melanie is pretty embarrassed about the situation herself. After their split she was seen rocking a humerous bandage over the tattoo with her own name scrawled on it. 

Angelina Jolie came in eighth place for making the same mistake as Griffith. She has now had the tattoo dedicated to her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton removed.

In ninth place was former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos for the 'Lucky You' message just above her bikini line. 

Many fans were horrified when they first spotted the singer's tattoo, she also has 'Female Boss,' on her right arm. 

Tenth place and perhaps the least offensive of all the tattoos went to Louis Tomlinson of One Direction for his 'Cup of Tea' design in tribute to the boy band's hit, Little Things.

The poll was carried out by Premier Laser Clinic, Britain's leading tattoo removal centres - somewhere our celebrities may like to remember. 

Katie Price, who stars in the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother decided the best way to get rid of her tattoo tribute to her husband Peter Andre was to draw a big cross over it

A spokesman for the clinic advised our stars to: 'Think before you ink - that should be engraved on the brain of everyone before they even contemplate having a tattoo, particularly if it is dedicated to a romantic partner.' 

Here's looking at you, Zayn.

And you should be particularly careful if you're planning an elaborate design like Cheryl.

'Technology has improved to such an extent that pretty much any embarrassing tattoo can be removed and barely leave a trace of the former artwork,' they said.

'Obviously some tattoos are easier to get off that others. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's floral design is said to have taken 14 hours to create and would take several months to remove.' 

The clinic also quizzed fans on what their favourite celebrity tattoos were and from David Beckham to Harry Styles these are the celebrities that come up trumps... 

1. Fans loved Victoria Beckham's Hebrew design down her upper spine that says: 'I am my love's and my love is mine, who browses among the lilies.'

2. It's the other famous Beckham, David in at second place for his touching tributes to his children particularly his new Harper tattoo for his three-year-old daughter Harper

Victoria Beckham's tattoo which runs down her spine was voted the best celebrity tattoo, they also enjoy Harry Styles' various designs 

3. Robbie Williams came in at number three for being one of the first celebrities to have a sleeve and embrace tattoos.

4. Well he does have a lot of them! Harry Styles comes in fourth for being one of the younger stars to adopt lots of bold designs.

5. Rita Ora is known for her bold tattoo designs which is why she comes in at number five.

6. Tom Daley celebrated the Olympics with a bunch of medals and a tattoo of the Olympic rings under his right arm coming in at number six. 

7. After giving birth to her first child Adele, in at number seven, had an adorable A design in tribute to her one-year-old son Angelo.

Johnny Depp fans love his tattoos which include a touching tribute to his daughter Lily Rose, they also enjoyed Fearne Cotton's colourful feet tattoo 

8. Fearne Cotton is a massive tattoo fan and her ink is pretty popular with others. Fans loved her bold design around her feet and lower leg.

9. Johnny Depp comes in at number nine. He has 13 tattoos including Lily Rose over his heart for his daughter and Betty Sue on his bicep for his mother.

10. Even though Megan Fox has now had her Marilyn Monroe tattoo removed from her lower left arm fans still voted it in at number ten.
