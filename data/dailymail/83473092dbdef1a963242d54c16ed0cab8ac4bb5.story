Wigan will be without England winger Josh Charnley for up to six weeks with an ankle injury sustained in Friday's 13-12 win over Hull.

Scans have revealed Charnley suffered a high ankle strain and, although he will not need surgery, he will wear a protective boot for around four weeks before he can resume training.

Dom Manfredi will take over the right-wing spot, starting with Friday's trip to Leeds.

'Josh is likely to be out for between four to six weeks,' Wigan coach Shaun Wane told the Wigan Evening Post.

'It's unfortunate but it gives Dom a chance to show what he can do and I'm chilled about it.

'Dom can do things which Josh can't. I'm a big fan of his.'
