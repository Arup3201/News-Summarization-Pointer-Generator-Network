Manchester United progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 3-0 win at home to Cambridge on Tuesday night.

Goals from Juan Mata, Marcos Rojo and James Wilson saw the Red Devils progress comfortably, after an initial scare in the opening stages of the match.

Here, Sportsmail's Luke Augustus rates each player as Louis van Gaal's men saw off their League Two opponents.

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-2-1-2)

David de Gea - 6

Was given a scare when Cambridge striker Tom Elliott went through on goal one-on-one with him but otherwise had little to do. 

Paddy McNair - 7

Handled his defensive duties well in an unfamiliar full back birth and supported Manchester United's attacks well. Started the move for Juan Mata's opener.

Chris Smalling - 6

Had a relatively quiet game in defence as United kept a clean sheet. 

Jonny Evans - 6

Same as Smalling, dealt with Cambridge's threat well.

Marcos Rojo - 6.5

Scored his first goal for United since joining the club from Sporting Lisbon with a close range header to double their lead. Made several useful forays going forward too. 

Marcos Rojo scored United's second of the match heading home from close range on 32 minutes

Daley Blind - 6

Made a woeful backpass that allowed Elliott to go through on goal in the opening stages of the match. Recovered soon after though as United dominated possession. 

Wayne Rooney - 7

Deployed on the right of a diamond formation and stuck to his role diligently. Came close with a couple of efforts.

Angel Di Maria - 7

Played in his natural left midfield role and constantly had the beating of his opposite full back, Richard Tait. Set up a chance for Rooney in the first half after a quick counter-attack. 

Juan Mata - 7

Scored the opening goal to settle United nerves and kept play ticking over neatly.

Marouane Fellaini - 7.5 - STAR MAN

Played up front in a role that was more akin to his Everton days. Provided the assist for Mata's opener and had a key role in Rojo's strike too. Impressed in the first half but faded in the second. 

Robin van Persie - 6.5

Failed to get on the scoresheet and was replaced just after the hour mark by James Wilson, but provided the assist for Rojo's goal with a neat cross.

Subs

James Wilson - 7 (replaced Van Persie on 66 mins)

Came on in place of Van Persie and grabbed the third goal of the match with a well-executed shot. His cameo would have pleased boss Louis van Gaal.

Ander Herrera - 6.5 (replaced Di Maria on 71 mins)

Was introduced towards the latter part of the second half but played the pass from which Wilson scored.

Ashley Young - 5 (replaced Young 81 mins)

Had little time to make an impact as a late substitute but whipped in some testing crosses into the Cambridge box. 

James WIlson (second right) came off the bench to score United's third as they swept past Cambridge

CAMBRIDGE (4-4-2): Dunn - 5; Tait - 5, Nelson 5 (Miller 87 - N/A), Coulson - 5, Taylor - 5; Donaldson - 5.5, McGeehan - 5.5, Champion - 5, Chadwick - 5 (Morrissey 51mins - 5); Elliott - 5 (Kaikai 61mins - 5.5), Simpson - 5.
