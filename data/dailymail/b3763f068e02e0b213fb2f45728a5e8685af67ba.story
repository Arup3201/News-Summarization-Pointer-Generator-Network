The magic has appeared to run out for gymnast Gabby Douglas, who failed to win a medal in her last London Olympics appearance after a fall left her clinging to the balance beam.

An hour later, Douglas' compatriot and Team USA captain Aly Raisman, finished strong in the floor exercise final to win her first individual gold medal.

Douglas' life has been a whirlwind since she won the all-around title last week, with media wanting a piece of her and celebs flooding her Twitter timeline, eager to be her new BFF.

As the days went on, the rigors of competition appeared to be taking her toll on Douglas.

She admitted after Monday's lackluster showing on bars - where she finished last - that the emotion and exhaustion had caught up with her.

But it wasn't a lack of energy that cost her today Tuesday - it was a misplaced foot.

Her right foot could only brush the beam as she landed on a leap, and she had no chance to save herself.

As the crowd gasped, she fell onto the beam in a straddle, hanging on tight as she swung partly underneath.

Still, she'll leave the London Olympics with two gold medals, including the all-around title, gymnastics' biggest prize.

About an hour after the balance beam final, Raisman - who won the bronze in a tiebreaker - became the first American female to win gold in the floor exercise. It was her third medal overall.

After the balance beam final, Douglas said: 'I'm definitely not going to lie. It was definitely hard to regain your focus. You're like, "Yes, I'm the Olympic champion. I'm a world champion."

'It's definitely kind of hard to turn the chapter for event finals.'

Raisman - who missed out on a medal in the all-around after a tiebreaker last week - won the bronze medal, thanks to a tiebreaker.

Raisman questioned her score after initially finishing fourth, and judges added an extra tenth to her routine's difficulty after reviewing it.

That gave her and Catalina Ponor identical scores of 15.066, but Raisman got the bronze and Ponor got bumped because the American's execution score was higher.

Big grins spread across Raisman's face 
and that of her coach, Mihai Brestyan, when the revision was announced, 
and she couldn't stop smiling as she climbed onto the medals podium.

The captain of the Fierce Five now has two medals, and a chance to add a third later Tuesday on floor exercise.

Douglas said she was proud of her achievement and the achievements of her team as a whole.

She said: 'I'm so happy, going home with two Olympic gold medals and a couple of titles under my belt,'

Douglas added: 'I'm so happy for Aly, she deserves to be up on that podium. She had a great beam routine and I'm so proud of her.'

Deng Linlin won the gold on balance beam, while compatriot Sui Lu took home the silver.
