Argentina and World Cup hero Diego Maradona thinks Germany's Thomas Muller 'has no muscles' but did well to rip Portugal apart as a 'ridiculous' and 'unprofessional' Pepe was sent off.

Pepe's red card, after the Real Madrid defender's flailing arm caught Muller in the face before the thuggish nudge of his head made referee Milorad Mazic's mind up for him, helped the Germany striker become the World Cup's leading top goalscorer.

It got Germany off to a perfect start, and Portugal off to a worst, leading Maradona to lend his two cents' worth to the game's issues.

Diego Maradona feels Cristiano Ronaldo was restricted from being his usual self, courtesy of Germany's zonal marking.

'Cristiano Ronaldo was not allowed to be
 the player he is for Real Madrid,' said Maradona.

'There was tight zonal marking on him 
and he had to try shots from a distance.

'The
 last time he had scored in the World Cup was against North Korea in 
2010.

'He will have to inspire his team in the two remaining matches 
against the USA and Ghana to earn a spot in the round of 16.'

When asked about Muller's performance against Portugal, Maradona told Times of India: 'He has no muscles, but he tore them apart.'

The 1986 World Cup winner, then, went on to ridicule Pepe's behaviour at the expense of his team's tournament chances.

'It was just ridiculous to see him act so foolishly,' said Maradona.

'It's true Muller played his role to perfection in the act but there was absolutely no need for Pepe to do what he did.

'His unprofessionalism snuffed out any hopes his team may have had of coming back in the game.'

Germany were already 2-0 up when Pepe was sent for an early shower, after Muller gave Joachim Low's side the lead with a penalty in the 12th minute.

But Maradona had an opinion on that decision, too, adding: 'The penalty through which Germany broke the deadlock was really soft.

'Joao Pereira did foul Mario Gotze but the Bayern Munich midfielder made the most of it and the Serbian referee obliged.

'But take nothing away from the Germans. They were superb as always.'

It wasn't just Portugal who had a dreadful week, though, as Spain took a hit in a 5-1 demolishing by the Netherlands.

But Maradona reckons Vicente del Bosque's men aren't done just yet.

'Spain can bounce back if their old soldiers fire,' he added.

'Del Bosque has to rethink strategy and give players like Koke a chance to play the all-important tie at the Maracana.

'It's a do or die battle for a team which won three major trophies since 2008.

'However, with a draw they can still survive the group if they beat the Socceroos by a big margin and Chile suffer a big defeat against Netherlands.'
