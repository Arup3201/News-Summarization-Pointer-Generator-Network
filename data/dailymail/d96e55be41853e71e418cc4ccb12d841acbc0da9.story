Small shards of metal have been found 'strategically placed' on the play equipment and on the ground of a children's playground.

About 20 pieces of metal, which appeared to have been cut from a can of drink, were found scattered across the playground at Kensington Park in Sydney's east on Tuesday.

The shards, which were found by Jenny Rose when she took her her 14-month-old grandson Archie to the park, were hidden and only noticeable when they reflected the sun.

'My son went to climb up the stairs and my mum and other parents noticed these shiny things,' Archie's mum Alice Rose told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It was like a soft drink can cut up. They were placed all over the steps and on the play equipment. There was also pieces in the rubber flooring wedged in. 

'It definitely wasn't an accident... her and a handful of other parents scoured the area and had to pull them out of the ground.'

Ms Rose said she takes her son to that particular park everyday and she was stunned that someone had the forward planning to place bits of metal where children could get hurt.

'He was going down the slide and the (metal) was down there. It was where the kids put their hands. They could have easily scratched their whole bodies going down,' she said. 

'There's so many little kids that play in that area. It really could have done some damage.' 

Alice Rose's 14-month-old son Archie was at Kensington Park playground when the shards of metal were found on the stars, wedged in the rubber matting and on the slippery dip 

Ms Rose's mother and several other parents found 20 pieces of metal after trawling the playground for 30 minutes on Tuesday.  

'It's quite scary that someone consciously planned to do this,' Ms Rose said.

'It's in an area where we go everyday. There's so many weirdos out there, I mean who does that.

'After seeing the pieces of metal, it's a reminder (to other parents) that you really have to be aware.'

Randwick City Council sent three crews out on Wednesday to inspect Kensington Oval and two other nearby parks. 

'I was very concerned to learn of this incident and we're grateful to the local residents for bringing it to our attention,' Randwick Mayor Ted Seng said.

'Council has sent outdoor crews to Kensington Park and adjacent parks to inspect and thoroughly check over the area. Fortunately, we did not find any remaining evidence of shredded cans. 

'This is the first time I have heard of something like this happening at a Randwick City playground and I hope it's the last. We have notified local police about this incident.'

The incident came to light after Ms Rose posted photos of the metal shards in a Facebook group to warn other mothers.

'Today we found these in the playground at Kensington Oval strategically spread across the ground and on the play equipment,' she wrote.

'They are small shards of metal cut and bent into sharp pieces with the intent of hurting innocent little hands and/or feet. Please check the play area before your little one races off, there are some sick people out there.'

Her post prompted outrage from other mothers who claimed similar incidents had happened in nearby parks at Bronte and Queens Park in recent months. 

Police were not aware of any incidents of shards of metal being intentionally left in playgrounds when Daily Mail Australia contacted them on Wednesday.
