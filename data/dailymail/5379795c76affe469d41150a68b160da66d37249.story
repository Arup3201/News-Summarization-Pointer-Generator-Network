Carmen Dell'Orefice is known as fashion's favourite (and oldest) silver-haired model but there may be a new girl in town about to take her crown.

Elegant and serene Jennie Rhodes, who matches Dell'Orifice's age at exactly 81, stars in a new couture campaign for upcoming fashion label VIELMA.

Modelling a texturally intriguing collection of thick and fine materials, leathers, python print and heavy jewellery, all in muted colours, Rhodes is 'strong and dynamic'.

The Chilian designer behind the brand, Gabriel Vielma, explains why he chose to work with Rhodes on the new campaign.

'There are different beauties in this world. Not only the young posses this quality. A flower posses beauty as does fashion. My looks are strong and dynamic and the model I chose is both.

'Her presence tells a story and this is 
inline with my collection. The clothes sit just as well on this woman as
they would on a 17 year old.

'There should be more models like 
this - that ooze character rather than having to paint it onto to them. 
The human form in all genders and ages is magnificent.

Thick and opulent materials with leather and croc accents, VIELMA's collection is punky and sophisticated

'There shouldn't 
be any discrimination. One doesn't really want to entertain the 
alternative.

'This model represents the collection with her experience, classic face and authentic soul.

'The VIELMA collection is inspired by a specific time in a woman’s life, a moment both beautiful and tragic, called Beautiful End of the World.

'It has
been created for a woman who has achieved or created for herself a very
special day.

'It could be the day she sweeps onto the stage in front of 
millions to receive an award crowning a lifetime’s achievement, or 
equally the day she has chosen to make a dignified exit.'

Jenni
Rhodes was a Hollywood actress and is now semi retired, though is 
currently signed to Close Models. She has been modelling for years, though her children and grandchildren haven't carried on a tradition.

VIELMA is the latest designer to embrace the trend, as older models are certainly in vogue at the moment.

Hipster 
retailer American Apparel also jumped on board casting senior citizen Jacky in recent campaign Advanced Basics.

A modelling novice, they discovered her walking down a New York street.
