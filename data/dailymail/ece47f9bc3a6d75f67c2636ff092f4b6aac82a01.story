A controversial multi-millionaire Tory donor is set to be made a peer by David Cameron, party sources claimed last night.

They said ex-Conservative Party treasurer Michael Spencer, boss of international broking giant ICAP, was under active consideration to be sent to the House of Lords by the Prime Minister.

In a long-awaited announcement, Mr Cameron is expected in the next few months to create up to 35 new Tory peers as part of a bid to ‘even up the odds’ with Labour in the House of Lords.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg may be allocated 15 new  Liberal Democrat peers – with major party donor Rumi Verjee, the businessman who brought  Domino’s Pizza to the UK, expected to be among them.

Last night, Mr Spencer, who was Conservative treasurer from 2006 to 2010 and has given more than £3 million to the party, was named as one of the potential Tory peers.

A senior party source said: ‘Nothing is decided yet but Michael is very likely to get a peerage in the next round. He’s a serious business figure and he worked very hard to raise money for the party.’

However, The Mail on Sunday understands the move has sparked surprise among Tories – not least  as it was confirmed only last month that ICAP is being investigated  in connection with the Libor rate-rigging scandal.

The tycoon, whose partner is Sarah, Marchioness of Milford Haven, also controversially off-loaded £45 million in shares  from the firm weeks before their value plunged and later admitted using £15 million of shares as security for a loan without telling the stock market.

However, Mr Spencer has previously insisted he did not act improperly over either share transaction.

It is not the first time Mr Spencer, a personal friend of Mr Cameron, has been linked with a peerage.

In 2010, there were repeated suggestions he would be sent to the Lords.

But last night, the senior party source claimed he was unaware of any major reason that the ex-party treasurer was not ennobled.

He said: ‘I know there was speculation in the past which didn’t materialise but I don’t see any reason he should not get one this time.

‘Michael has supported the  party for a very long time. He’s  a senior business person and as treasurer he worked hard to raise funds for us.’

Mr Spencer’s firm ICAP confirmed last month it was being quizzed by City watchdogs over the Libor rate-rigging affair.
