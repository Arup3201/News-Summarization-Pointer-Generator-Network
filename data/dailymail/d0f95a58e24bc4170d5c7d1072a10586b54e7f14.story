Paramedic Richard Senior (pictured) and colleague Andrew Rowley were suspended for a year after boasting about their sex lives to female colleagues

Two paramedics have been banned from working for 12 months after subjecting female colleagues to lewd comments and sexual antics.

Richard Senior repeatedly asked a lesbian paramedic ‘when am I going to be your sperm donor?’ 

He also tried to set up a ‘foursome’ involving the same woman and her ex-partner, a disciplinary hearing was told.

The former Club 18 to 30 holiday rep ‘crossed the line’ by boasting about his past sexual conquests at meal breaks as well as with patients.

He also openly displayed a ‘sexually explicit’ photograph on the home screen of his mobile phone showing him involved in a sex act.

Senior made matters worse by breaking rules concerning the use of sirens and blue lights during call outs, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) Conduct and Competence Committee was told.

Ambulance service policy was to use the sirens and lights on emergencies unless instructed otherwise by the control room, but he repeatedly used his discretion by telling colleagues to turn them off.

In one call-out, Senior drove at just 30mph without lights or sirens only to discover ‘a non-serious incident actually turned out to be serious.’

Andrew Rowley, a paramedic also based at the ambulance station in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was accused of making a host of rude and distasteful comments and gestures towards colleagues.

He allegedly behaved like a bully by telling a newly qualified medic she was ‘useless’ - causing her to have time off with stress.

When the lesbian colleague – described as Colleague A - was mistaken for a man by an elderly patient, Rowley told her ‘it doesn’t matter…I’d still do you.’

The men were said to be ‘worse when they were together.’ 

They were split up and given final written warnings by Yorkshire Ambulance Service bosses following complaints in 2013.

But the healthcare regulator’s disciplinary committee this week suspended them from working as paramedics for 12 months.

Senior, who has worked for the ambulance service for nine years, had five misconduct allegations against him found ‘proved.’

His behaviour was a ‘serious departure from the standards expected of a Paramedic’ and the panel expressed concern that he failed to show remorse or understand his ‘attention-seeking’ behaviour crossed professional boundaries with patients.

The panel described Rowley’s behaviour as ‘bullying and intimidatory.’ His offences were said to be ‘serious and not isolated incidents.’

Rowley, who worked for the ambulance service for 10 years, had four allegations against him ‘proved.’

He continued to deny most of the accusations but had quit the profession and no longer worked as a paramedic.

Senior, 43, of Dewsbury, refused to comment when contacted at home yesterday.

The panel heard that he boasted about the number of women he ‘had had’ during his time working as a holiday rep.

One witness said Senior discussed his former jobs with patients – who were ‘always female’ – and chatted about his ‘sexual conquests.’

The paramedic was heard to make ‘noises of a sexual nature’ during his recollections of life as a Club 18 to 30 rep. 

He denied the inappropriate conversations, but told the panel patients often asked him about his pre-paramedic career and when he mentioned his work as a holiday rep they tended to make assumptions about his sex life and prowess.

Another female colleague told the hearing how Senior made comments about visualising her breast feeding when she returned from maternity leave and telling her ‘I don’t know why I never banged you when you were younger.’

Detailed evidence was given about his inappropriate behaviour towards Colleague A.

She was said to be embarrassed by his references to her sexuality as she didn’t like talking about her private life.

Commenting on claims he repeatedly suggested a foursome, Senior said it was Colleague A who made the suggestion at his 40th birthday party when they were both drunk.

Witnesses recalled another incident in which Colleague A was the subject of his inappropriate comments.

Senior was taking a regular male patient into a hospital accident and emergency department. This patient had previously made comments about liking Colleague A and Senior allegedly said to her ‘it’s not such a bad thing he’s after you, it might get you back on the fellas.’

Publicly drawing attention to her sexuality was said to cause her ‘much upset.’
