Ciro Immobile has revealed that Italy are training in a sauna to prepare for the heavy humidity in the Brazilian city of Manaus.

Italy will take on England in their World Cup opener on June 14 at the Arena de Amazonia, which is on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.

And the Italian striker said that the Azzurri are already trying to replicate the tough conditions expected in Manaus at their training base in Coverciano.

Immobile said: 'We are working in a sauna which is helping us prepare for the Manaus temperatures.

'We have done a day and a half at high intensity and we are preparing very well for the World Cup. We want to go there with maximum desire and intensity.

'What happens in the sauna? Nothing strange! We are doing specific training in order to help us acclimatise.'
