Time to get tough: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron

Senior Tories say David Cameron should commit to backing an exit from the EU if he fails to negotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels.

Voters may not be convinced by his pledge of an in/out referendum by 2017 unless he toughens his stance, they say.

After Nigel Farage's advances in local and European elections, MPs also say victory in next week's by-election in Newark is vital to burst the Ukip bubble.

Mr Cameron said the message from voters had been 'absolutely received and understood'. He said: 'People are deeply  disillusioned with the European Union, they don't feel that the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain.

'What we need to do is demonstrate we are the ones with the plan to sort out this relationship and give people the choice – in or out.'

The Tories' Euro election results were not as bad as feared, however. Many were taken aback to find their party came close to beating Labour into second place in polls voters often use to punish governing parties.

In some regions, such as the South West, the Conservative vote was almost the same as in 2009, at the height of Gordon Brown's unpopularity.

However, the figures suggest the party will struggle to gain a majority at a general election even if it is the largest single group – raising the prospect of another coalition.

A source close to the 1922 Committee of Backbench Tories said: 'There's no need for seismic change. But the problem is these results confirm where we thought we were: cruising for a messy result next year.

'Obviously holding Newark is important, but the big message from the results is about the lack of trust in politics... Do people really believe there is actually going to be a referendum?'

Tory MP Mark Field said an outright win was a 'tall order', and Cameron's pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Europe had not 'shot the [Ukip] fox'.

'Ukip present themselves as a party that wants to break down compromises they see in... the Westminster village,' he said.

'The truth is there's more to choose between the Conservatives and Labour than there has been in the last 25 years.'

Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said: 'Tory MPs may have agreed not to panic in the light of Ukip's big win, but that doesn't mean David Cameron isn't going to come under a huge amount of pressure from them.'

They will demand he brings forward the referendum and sets out his plans for renegotiating relations with the EU, he said. Senior Tories, such as business minister Michael Fallon, urged Mr Cameron to say he would back leaving the EU if he could not arrange a favourable deal.

Worryingly for Conservatives, the European results put Ukip ahead in some parts of Newark, site of next Thursday's by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer.

Mr Cameron has already made two campaign visits to the area. One Tory MP said a failure to listen to voters could cost them the seat.

He added: 'Everyone says they've heard the voters' anger... but then the usual  cliche-laden, soft-Left social democratic politics carries on as before. I'm not sure that's going to win it for us in Newark.'  Tory Peter Bone said he was 'confident' of victory, but called for a deal with Ukip.

He said: 'Personally, I'd take Cameron and Farage and lock them in a room, and not let them out until they've reached an agreement.'

The Prime Minister rejected calls to back an EU exit, saying other member countries are also keen on reform. 'I am confident of a good renegotiation,' he said.

He said he will not countenance 'pacts or deals' with Ukip. 'Conservative candidates will stand as Conservatives, fight as Conservatives and I hope win as Conservatives,' he added. 

Francois Hollande, the French president, and a champion of the EU, said that the EU must reform and scale back.

He said the EU had become too 'remote and incomprehensible'.

'Europe has to be simple, clear, to be effective where it is needed and to withdraw from where it is not necessary,' he said.

Even after the Conservative Party’s most humiliating performance in a national election since 1906, David Cameron was still in denial yesterday about why he and the Tories are so unpopular.

Although he said he accepts that ‘people are deeply disillusioned with the EU’, none of the other messages that great swathes of Middle Britain sent to the Government — and indeed Labour — by voting so heavily for Ukip have been understood.

Certainly people are cheesed off with the anti-democratic, elitist and corrupt Leviathan that the EU has become.

But they are also angry and frustrated that Mr Cameron has, for many years, mostly responded to such demands with talk rather than action.

While he has outlined plans to restrict immigration and to limit access by new immigrants to welfare benefits and public services, the problem becomes worse daily.

While the Prime Minister and his colleagues have indulged in rhetoric, tens of thousands of people from Eastern Europe have poured into Britain — leaving our own citizens with the feeling that the Government couldn’t care less about their prosperity, their aspirations and their investment in the country.

This is compounded by the fact that Mr Cameron seems unable to understand — or refuses to admit — that Ukip also champions policies that voters once found in the older, establishment parties but which the Oxbridge-educated, metropolitan elite who now run them find unpalatable.

Between them, Ukip and the Tories got nearly 52 per cent of the vote in the European elections, confirming that there is a right-of-centre majority in this country. 

Mr Cameron’s dilemma is how to unite these conservative forces and prevent Ed Miliband becoming prime minister next year by default.

While this seems to be a challenge that is being ducked by leading Tories such as William Hague, who parroted the line that the Tory party doesn’t do pacts, in fact it has had to in the past and can do again.

A number of MPs and MEPs — led by Daniel Hannan and including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Douglas Carswell and Peter Bone — have said publicly that the Tories and Ukip must come to an accommodation.

Principles are one thing: but the point of being in politics is to have power, and power is haemorrhaging away from the Tories otherwise.

Compromise: A number of MPs and MEPs ¿ led by Daniel Hannan and including Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured), Douglas Carswell and Peter Bone ¿ have said publicly that the Tories and Ukip must come to an accommodation.

Although no member of the Cabinet is prepared to countenance such a possibility yet, some junior ministers (as well as numerous backbench Tory MPs worried about losing their seats next year) would find it easy to strike some deal with Ukip.

Despite Mr Cameron’s antipathy, it would be straightforward for Tory parliamentary candidates to be allowed to begin discussions with Ukip at a local level.

It is highly unlikely that a sitting MP is going to give up his seat for a Ukip candidate.

However, in constituencies such as Thanet South, in Kent, where Nigel Farage has been tipped to stand and the incumbent Tory MP is standing down, there is nothing to be gained by putting up a novice Tory candidate against him when he could quite likely win the seat without having his vote split by the Tory.

There will be other seats where Tories might choose not to field a candidate and where Ukip is strong. In return, Ukip could decide not to fight seats where a Tory incumbent stands the best chance of defeating Labour.

Similar deals were made when Winston Churchill’s Tories formed an alliance with the National Liberals in 1951.

In any case, many Ukip activists used to be Tory activists. Negotiations ought not to prove difficult.

For his part, Nigel Farage has always been open-minded about a deal, though reluctant to do one with Mr Cameron because of the toxic image the PM has among most Ukip supporters.

I suspect he might feel able to change his party’s mind on that if there were advantages for Ukip, such as posts for his team in a Tory/Ukip government.

Ukip would hope to see some movement within the Tory party on policies other than Europe, notably on public spending and education.

But there are many Tory MPs, too, who wish their leadership would ditch its opposition to grammar schools and its £10 billion-a-year overseas aid programme.

Ukip has a clear idea of where it can win seats. It will shortly embark on a fundraising drive to help its general election campaign and it hopes this week’s success will bring money flooding in, as well as attracting new activists.

If the Tories have any sense, they will start talking about such an arrangement now. For if, next week, Ukip wins the Newark by-election and the Tories descend into panic, David Cameron might find himself with no other option.
