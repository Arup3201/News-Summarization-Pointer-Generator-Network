Despite his best efforts, including an elaborate promo video, Michael Jordan has failed to find a single bidder interested in meeting the reserve price of $13m for his 56,000-square-foot mansion near Chicago.

The failure of Monday’s auction has forced realtors working for the basketball legend to shelve the proposed sale until the new year.

Jordan had originally placed the fully furnished Legend Point estate up for sale in March 2012 for $29 million.

Secluded: Michael 'Air' Jordan planted trees all around the property to make it a private retreat

The property is being sold with all the furniture included, meaning a buyer can eat where the legendary Chicago Bulls player staged 'breakfast clubs' with his title winning team mates

At the time, it was the highest-priced 
home in the Chicago area, with the tax bill on the property set at 
$178,900 in 2012, according to public records.

‘We are disappointed that the high bid 
in today’s auction of Michael Jordan’s residence in Highland Park did 
not meet the reserve price. Concierge Auctions gave great exposure to 
the property and opportunity, but the market conditions were just not 
right to drive a fair value.’ said Estee Portnoy, spokeswoman for 
Michael Jordan.

‘We will be evaluating options for the property in the new year.’

Prospective buyers had been required to put down a $250,000 deposit just to participate in bidding for the estate, reports the Chicago Tribune.

Located directly off the pool pavilion, the three-bedroom guest wing offers a gourmet kitchen, en suite bathrooms and built-in furnishings

Home court: Jordan had a regulation size basketball surface installed in the house complete with logo branding

Michael Jordan's biography on the official NBA website reads: 'By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.'

His honors list includes:

Jordan was unbeaten in all six of his NBA finals. As well as a 10 time NBA scoring champion, he was named in the NBA All-Defensive First team 9 times. He is considered the best all-round basketball star to have played the game.

As part of their efforts to sell the 
pricy property, Concierge Auctions had shot an elaborate video to provide 
prospective buyers - and Jordan fans - with an intimate view of the 
plush 7.4 acre complex which the star designed, built and lived in for 19 
years.

Heavily branded with the 
superstar's 'jumping man' logo, the nine bedroom, 19 bathroom property comes with its own NBA regulation size 
basketball court, a wine cellar, PGA putting green, infinity swimming 
pool, pool pavilion, and tennis court.

‘Located
 directly off the pool pavilion, the three-bedroom guest wing offers a 
gourmet kitchen, en suite bathrooms and built-in furnishings,’ states 
promotional material about the attempted sale.

They can also shoot hoops where he refined his legendary game.

Work it out: The record breaker was known for his work ethic, which explains why the house has a gym

Fenced
 on all sides by trees which Jordan had planted especially to screen the
 plot, the house is only accessible through a pair of wrought 
iron gates bearing the baller's famous jersey number 23.

The
 Illinois house comes with a wine cellar and cigar room fitted with an 
air filtration system which means, despite years of use, there is no 
scent of smoke on the plush furnishings.

The sale includes art pieces such as a bespoke table, crafted for Jordan to show the layout of the city of Baghdad.

The house even contains bedroom doors which were taken from the entrance to the original Playboy Mansion. 

The video features evocative images of Jordan's title winning stints at the Chicago Bulls. It also shows interviews with his former teammates who talk of gym workouts they used to have at the house.

Icon: Jordan's famous Nike endorsement saw his 'jumping man' logo become part of pop-culture. He is said to earn $80m every year from his business deals

It ends with the auctioneer sinking an NBA-range 3-point shot.

Speaking of the legend's reason for selling the house, project manager Nick Leonard said:
 'Fame withheld, Michael Jordan has a lot of similarities to our typical
 seller. He's an extremely savvy very successful business person.

'He has a spectacular property, one of a kind, and he’s not using it.

'So he’s taking control of the market, he's setting a sale date and he's going to auction it to the high bidder.

'For anyone with any interest, it’s now or never.'

Despite that boastful sales pitch the property didn't sell this time, it is expected back on the market in the new year when the asking price may have to be substantially reduced to make a sale.

Professional green: The golfing surface is PGA standard and, like other features in the house, comes with personal Jordan branding
