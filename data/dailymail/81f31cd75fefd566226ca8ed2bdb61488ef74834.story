Video captures the breathless moment a motocross spectator talking on a cellphone dodged a biker who came barreling toward him.

Footage of the event posted on Facebook shows the driver making a jump and then landing on the other side of a creek bank, where they begin to slide on the wet mud.

A man standing directly in the driver's path, wearing an orange hoodie and talking on his cellphone, quickly jumps in place to avoid the driver who crashes into the tree he was leaning on.

Quick reflexes: Video captures the moment a motocross spectator avoided a collision with a driver who slid on a patch of mud and came barreling toward him

The busy man stumbles after the jump but quickly puts himself together and continues to talk on the phone without so much as a 'phew'. 

The incident happened at the Grand National Cross Country event in St Clairsville, Ohio's Powerline Park. 

A 'Blooper Dudes XC Bike and Quad bloopers' camera man caught the frightening near-accident, and posted the video to the group's Facebook page last week.

'Oh, i'm just jumping dirtbikes while I'm on my phone, no big deal,' the group wrote when they posted the video.
