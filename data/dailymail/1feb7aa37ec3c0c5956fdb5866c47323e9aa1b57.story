A veteran sheriff's deputy and father-of-four who was one of two officers gunned down in a shooting rampage that spanned 30 miles across California on Friday died exactly 26 years to the day that his own father, who was also killed in the line of fire.

Michael Davis Jr., 42, was shot dead by a male and female couple who were on the run from killing another deputy in Sacramento earlier in the day.

His death tragically mimicked that of his father, Michael Davis Sr., who was killed on the job on the same day in 1988.

The incident started about 10.30am in the parking lot of the Motel 6 in Sacramento.

Fateful: Michael Davis Jr., 42 (left), a sheriff's deputy of 15 years, was killed in a shooting on October 24 - the same day his father, Michael Davis Sr. (right) was also killed in the line of the duty in 1988

Shooter: Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, fled police but was eventually flushed out of a home he hid in for several hours using gas bombs. He and a female companion are now in custody

High alert:  Law enforcement officers stop to search cars as they left the area in response to an officer involved shooting on Friday, October 24, 2014

Scene: Law enforcement officers in Auburn, Calif., in response to a shooting on Friday. Another officer was shot 30 miles away in Sacramento

Huge response: A suspect armed with a rifle left one Sacramento sheriff's deputy dead, a motorist gravely injured, and two Placer County sheriff's deputies wounded in a 30-mile crime spree

Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, approached a suspicious-looking car, but the occupants immediately opened fire.

He was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range and did not have time to draw his weapon.

He died in hospital.

Oliver, a 15-year veteran of the department, was the first Sacramento County deputy killed since 2008.

He left a wife and two daughters.

After Oliver was shot, his partner fired at the attackers, who drove about a mile before attempting a carjacking.

The attackers then stole a red Ford pickup from a gardener and fled to the Sierra Nevada foothills city of Auburn in neighboring Placer County, about 30 miles northeast of Sacramento.

Tragic: Deputy Danny Oliver, a father and officer of 15 years, was the first officer to be shot, sparking a wide-spanning hunt for the killer that ended 30 miles away

Unprovoked: The suspects immediately opened fire, police said

That is when officer Michael Davis Jr. and his partner spotted the car parked alongside the road.

Both were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said.

Davis, who had been working in law enforcement since 1996 - the last 10 years a homicide investigator - died from his injuries.

His partner Jeff Davis - no relation - a 17-year department veteran, was treated for a gunshot wound in the arm. 

Police suspect the shooter was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City, who was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking.

A woman with him, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, was in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking.

Monroy was arrested at the scene where Davis was killed.

Police found a handgun in her purse.

Deputies finally used tear gas to flush Marquez from the basement of the home where he hid for several hours. 

Arrested: This is the man police believe was behind the rampage that claimed the lives of two officers. Marcelo Marquez was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking

Emergency: A special agent with the California Department of Justice walks a student from the Discovery Montessori school to her parents after being on lock-down because a suspect in the multiple shootings of officers in Sacramento and Placer Counties

Evacuated: The area was placed on lock-down as police tried to flush out the suspect, who was hiding in a nearby house

Jail records contained no indications that either suspect had outstanding arrest warrants.

Both were being held without bail. Initial court appearances were expected Tuesday.

A search of Utah court records for Marquez shows a history of about 10 tickets and misdemeanor traffic offenses between 2003 and 2009. 

Those records list one speeding ticket for Monroy in 2009 and three small claims filings attempting to collect outstanding debts. 

The slaying of the deputies was the single deadliest day for California law enforcement since February 2013.

In separate incidents that month, former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner killed two law enforcement officers, and two Santa Cruz police detectives were shot and killed.
