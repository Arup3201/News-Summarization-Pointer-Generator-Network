A British serviceman was crushed to death under a damaged Jackal armoured vehicle which was being driven by an unqualified driver.

An inquest was told senior aircraftsman Kinikki Griffiths, 20, was killed when the vehicle rolled backwards while he tried to fix a diesel leak in July 2010.

And that Corporal William Wortley, who did not have a driving licence, could not even remember if he had put the hand brake on when the fatality occurred.

Senior aircraftsman Kinikki Griffiths, 20, suffered devastating crush injuries to his chest and abdomen after a Jackal armoured personnel vehicle rolled on top of him as he helped fix a diesel leak

He also did not know what worked when the engine was switched on or off and was not not aware of any chocks which could stop it rolling.

The coroner was told about a catalogue of shortcomings leading to the accident and a lawyer asked during the hearing if servicemen were operating in a ‘blissful ignorance of hazards’.

The death happened after a three vehicle convoy was sent from Camp Bastion to recover explosive equipment and thermal imaging gear and occurred three kilometres from the military base.

Squadron Leader David Cook said if the equipment had fallen into insurgent hands it would have ‘compromised our mission’.

The inquest was told their was 'naivety' around operating the Jackal, seen here being crewed by British soldiers in Afghanistan, and that better training on how to use it would of helped prevent accidents

The accident happened three kilometres from Camp Bastion, seen above, after three vehicles were deployed to recover explosive equipment and thermal imaging gear

Cpl Wortley, who was in charge of the 
heavy machine guns on the vehicle, took the wheel saying: 'I thought I 
was doing the right thing. I said I would drive.'

Under cross examination he admitted: 'I had limited experience of anything automatic.'

He
 said he was ‘keen to drive because the lads were tired’ and admitted 
breaching an order by saying he was in the command seat and not driving.

The hearing heard reports that he had driven the vehicle as many as 15 times previous.

The death happened after the Jackal was stopped so the leak could be repaired.

Military witnesses were seriously affected by the tragedy, near Camp Bastion, seen above, and at one point a witness left the inquest in tears

Cpl Wortley said he cannot remember damaging the Jackal in a dip while driving, and 
wasn't speeding because of the difficult terrain and the risk of rolling.

RAF
 sergeant James Whitby told the hearing he went underneath the Jackal to
 examine the leak and found a black plastic bag where someone had tried 
to fix it previously.

He had ordered the engine to be turned off to avoid a possible explosion.

SAC Griffiths, from Exmouth, Devon, then went underneath to shine a torch on the problem area.

The
 hearing was told there was a hissing sound which may have come from the
 hydraulics before the Jackal moved down towards the ground and rolled 
backwards and on top of SAC Griffiths.

The inquest heard that SAC Griffiths  was wearing body armour and his helmet but that could not have saved him when the armoured vehicle rolled backwards trapping him, near Camp Bastion

Cpl Wortley told the hearing he felt the vehicle strike his shoulder and thought he
 may be crushed as it rolled back.

He said: 'I thought it was my time. I
 was being pushed down.I was not aware how I got out.'

Flight
 Lieutenant Matthew Quinney admitted there was a ‘naivety’ about 
operating the Jackal and better training beforehand would have helped. The hearing also heard the vehicles had been recalled for brake problems.

The
 inquest was told that RAF personnel arriving in Afghanistan were not 
qualified to drive the vehicle and had to undergo a five day 
course before getting behind the wheel.

The
 coroner, Dr Elizabeth Earland, said a post mortem concluded that SAC 
Griffiths suffered ‘devastating crush injuries to his chest and abdomen’
 and would have lost consciousness rapidly.

The inquest at Exeter’s County Hall heard that he was wearing body armour and his helmet but that could not have saved him.

The 
coroner said some of the military witnesses were ‘seriously affected by 
the tragedy’. At one point Cpl Wortley left the hearing in tears.

The inquest is due to last three days.
