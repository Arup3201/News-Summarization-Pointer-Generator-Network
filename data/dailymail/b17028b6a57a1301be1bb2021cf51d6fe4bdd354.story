Chelsea captain John Terry has signed a new one-year contract extension.

It had been reported that the Chelsea captain was so keen to stay at Stamford Bridge that he was willing to accept a pay-cut, but the 33-year-old now looks set to secure a deal somewhere close to his current £150,000-a-week wage.

Speaking about his new deal, Terry told the official Chelsea website: 'I'd like to thank the fans and club for their continued support, and the manager who was instrumental for me the last season.

Captain, leader, legend: Terry has been at Chelsea since 1995

'I'm delighted to have signed an extension to my contract with Chelsea taking me into my 20th year with the club.'

Chelsea's Chief Executive Ron Gourlay added: 'We are very pleased John, who is an undoubted Chelsea legend, will continue to lead the team next season, as he has done for so many years with unrivalled achievement.

'Both Chelsea FC and John have been clear throughout that we wanted his outstanding career at the club to continue, and it is important the matter has been concluded so soon after the end of the season, allowing us to look forward to and plan for 2014/15.'

Blues brother: The Chelsea board were confident that Terry would be signing a new deal

Although Terry was attracting interest from clubs across Europe, the Chelsea board were always confident that the former England captain would sign a new deal.

There had been question marks over the futures of Terry, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, but Mourinho's first priority would surely have been to tie the former down for at least another year.

Although doubts still remain over the futures of Lampard and Cole, Chelsea fans can at least count on their captain, leader, legend for another season.
