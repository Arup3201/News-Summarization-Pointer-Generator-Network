Two people were arrested today after a suspected sham marriage was stopped moments before they were to be officially married.

Home Office immigration enforcement officers raided the wedding just before a 21-year-old French woman planned to wed a Cameroonian man.

Investigators attended the ceremony at Winchester Register Office in Hampshire following a tip-off that it might not be genuine.

Two other people were later arrested at an address in the city.

Arrests: Police and Home Office immigration officers arrested the man and woman moments before their suspected sham marriage ceremony in Winchester, Hampshire

Searches: The raid has led to searches of properties in London and Basingstoke over fears the marriage was not genuine

The woman was held on suspicion of perjury, bigamy and assisting unlawful immigration. It is suspected she had been married twice before, neither of which relationship had been dissolved.

The 26-year-old Cameroonian man, whose leave to remain in the UK expires shortly, was detained on suspicion of perjury.

Both were being questioned at a police station in Hampshire, while searches took place at properties in Basingstoke and Lewisham, south London.

The Home Office said the operation took place with the full co-operation of the superintendent registrar.

Stuart Reynolds, of the Home Office immigration enforcement criminal investigations team, said: 'We work closely with registrars across the south of England to stop abuse of the marriage system by those who wish to get round our immigration laws.

Co-operation: Police said the Winchester Registry Office assisted in the arrests

'Where there are suspicions that a relationship may not be genuine, we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene to stop it happening.'

A spokesman said a sham marriage or civil partnership typically occurs when a non-European national marries someone from the European Economic Area as a means of attempting to gain long-term residency and the right to work and claim benefits in the UK.

Commenting on the arrests in Winchester High Street he added: 'A 29-year-old man from the Ivory Coast and a 30-year-old man who presented a Belgium identity card were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law just after 11am.

'Officers also found a quantity of cash which has been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act.'
