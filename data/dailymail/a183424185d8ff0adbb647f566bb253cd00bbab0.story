The New York Daily News reports that the warrant charges Riera, 51, with six counts of oral sex with children.

'There were two juveniles involved in the incident,' said LAPD officer Nuria Vanegas. 'It happened here in Los Angeles. In Hollywood to be exact.'

A anonymous source who knew about the arrest told Staten Island Live that Riera was taken into custody by six agents along with the fire department inspector general.

He was led out of the stationhouse in full uniform and a pair of handcuffs.

Riera was held in custody in New York before court proceedings can be completed to have him extradited to the LAPD.

Riera, an EMS captain, is a 21-year veteran of the NYFD.

He has been suspended for 30 days without pay.

He has received at least three FDNY awards for saving the lives of four patients while on the way to the hospital.

He had also served as the president of the Brentwood Legion Ambulance on Long Island from 2001 to 2002.
