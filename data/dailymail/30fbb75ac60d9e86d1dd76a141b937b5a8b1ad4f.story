A Queensland family who took advantage of their elderly landlord after he offered them a roof over their heads have allegedly repaid him by trashing his house.

The Bickles were living out of their car when Brian Radke decided to give them a second chance by letting them live in his house for $400 a week if they helped fix it up after the Good Samaritan's previous tenants had left it in a wreck.

But Mr Radke told A Current Affair his bad luck continued when he discovered the Bickles had left holes in his home's wall and dumped rubbish in the backyard when he decided to take them to court and evict them for not paying rent.

Brian Radke (pictured here with A Current Affair reporter Tim Arvier) allegedly had his house trashed by a Queensland family

Lloyd and Diane Bickle, along with their son, were evicted from Mr Radke's home after he took them to court for not paying rent

As the cameras continued to roll, Bickle patriarch - Lloyd - became more aggressive with ACA reporter Tim Arvier

'They never made any attempt to leave the house and to me, I believe, they used the system the way it is to stay in the house as long as they can,' Mr Radke said.

But this was not the first time the family had been evicted for not paying their rent.

According to A Current Affair, the family were evicted nine months earlier at another home where they caused more than $75,000 worth of damage.

It was a similar story to the one experienced by Mr Radke, the Channel Nine program claimed the Bickles owed their previous landlord thousands of dollars and left the house with doors off the hinges, holes in the walls and piles of rubbish strewn throughout the house.

'They then told me it [the problems at the previous home] was a fault of their children, their children had ran amuck,' Mr Radke told A Current Affair.

'It was their fault that they were in the situation they were.'Â

Lloyd Bickle threatened to 'smash' the ACA reporter's mouth in when he showed up to film his family being evicted

The family claim Mr Radke had agreed to let them live rent-free for six months if they helped fix a bathroom and kitchen

Mr Radke claimed this was the second time tenants had trashed his home

While the Bickles left Mr Radke's house, they were captured on camera by the news program.

In the footage, Mr Bickle is seen swearing at reporter Tim Arvier and threatening to 'smash [his] f**king mouth in'.

The Bickle patriarch claimed he and Mr Radke had agreed to six months rent-free if he helped fix up the bathroom and kitchen.

He called Mr Radke a 'lying b*****d' when the landlord denied it.

'These dodgy landlords pull this s**t all the time,' Mr Bickle told A Current Affair.

'I haven't trashed the house.

'This house is a f**king dump...[we lived here] because we had nowhere to go.'

Mr Radke is now trying to recover the Bickles alleged unpaid rent through the courts.

But little did the Good Samaritan know his new tenants had been evicted nine months ago from another home (pictured)
