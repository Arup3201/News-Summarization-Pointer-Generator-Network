They say revenge is a dish best served cold.

And, for one jilted wife, if a few bugs and grubs are thrown in, all the better.

For Rachael Butler – whose  husband had an affair with Nadine Dorries – has revealed how she has voted ‘hundreds of times’ for the Tory MP to take part in I’m A Celebrity’s gruesome bushtucker trials.

Hard to stomach: Nadine Dorries, 55, who was suspended from the Conservative Party when she went on ITV show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been repeatedly voted to undergo sickening Bushtucker Trials

The 56-year-old mother of two has even put Miss Dorries’s hotline number into her speed dial to save crucial seconds when she is voting against her on the ITV reality.

The 55-year-old politician has already had to face two gruelling ordeals, in which she was forced to eat a camel’s toe and a lamb’s testicle, and locked inside a wooden coffin filled with maggots, crickets and cockroaches.

And there could be bigger trials to come – she has been suspended from the Conservative Party and faces questions upon her return about her reasons for abandoning her post for up to four weeks on full pay.

Mrs Butler, who was married to husband John for 30 years before their split last year, said: ‘I voted for her to do the trial thing.

‘I wanted to see her suffer – I don’t want her to be voted off.  They go into a five star hotel if they leave. B***** that – I don’t want to see that. Keep her suffering.

‘I wanted to see her suffer – I don’t want her to be voted off.  They go into a five star hotel if they leave. B***** that – I don’t want to see that. Keep her suffering.

‘I’m loving it. I’ve got her number on speed dial and I won’t stop voting on her to do trials. I must have voted  for her hundreds of times. It’s worth the money.

‘The public seem to be picking on her and I’m like, “Carry on, keep on picking on Dorries, she deserves everything she gets”.’

Mrs Butler first met Miss Dorries, then married to her ex-husband Paul, from whom she split in 2006, in the late 1990s when they became neighbours in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire.

Their daughters attended the same school, and the couples used to meet regularly for dinner, even going on holiday together to St Lucia in 2000.

Scary: Nadine Dorris (in a 'bug burial' Bushtucker Trial) has drawn criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties for the Australian jungle, but pledged to donate her MP's salary during her time on the show to charity

But last year the friendship ended after it emerged the MP had started a relationship with Mr Butler. Mrs Butler said at the time she became suspicious of her husband ‘when he started to go to the pub a lot’.

She added: ‘Before Christmas he was going out every night and he said he had to meet friends.

‘Some nights he just never came home. I kept saying to him, “Is there another woman?”. He would say, “No, no, no, there isn’t”. Foolishly I believed him.

‘My marriage hasn’t been in good shape for some years. It died a death some time ago. But this doesn’t excuse Nadine for what she did.

‘I just want everyone to know  that Nadine Dorries is not the saintly person she appears to be. Because she’s an MP, people think of her as a pillar of society but in fact she’s a marriage-wrecker.’

Miss Dorries and Mr Butler split in October last year after around nine months together.

But Mrs Butler has refused to forget the hurt their relationship has caused. She said yesterday: ‘It did all die down and now she is in the public eye again. It’s a bit annoying.

‘She’s never been into that sort of thing, camping and roughing it. She likes creature comforts and luxury hotels. She is definitely doing it for the publicity and for the money.

‘She will probably need the money when she gets out because she might not have a job. I want her to stay in there, I don’t want her being voted off. Let’s keep her in the jungle.’
