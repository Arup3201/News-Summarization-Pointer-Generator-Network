The News of the World was so intent on surveillance that even the paper's own editor Rebekah Brooks had her office bugged, it has been claimed.

Labour MP Tom Watson made the allegations in his new book on the scandal engulfing Rupert 
Murdoch’s News International empire.

He says Mrs Brooks came under surveillance by June last year as a police 
inquiry into hacking gathered pace.

Allegations: Labour MP Tom Watson says the NOTW bugged Rebekah Brooks' (right) office in his new book

In ‘Dial M For Murdoch’ he claims: ‘According to one well-placed News Corp source, security 
staff were ordered to record the times of Brook's entry to and exit from
Thomas More Square [News International's headquarters] and cleaners 
were warned to avoid disturbing listening devices placed under the table
and by her computer in her office.’

The frontbencher also claimed MPs had 
their private lives probed and reporters were ordered to dig up dirt on 
them in order to dissuade them from investigating the phone hacking at 
the newspaper.

And he says that the paper sought to strike a deal with him, agreeing they would ‘give him’ Andy Coulson – the former News of the World editor who became David Cameron’s communications chief – as long as he agreed to leave Mrs Brooks alone.

Watson says the paper tried to strike a deal with him, agreeing they would ‘give him’ Andy Coulson, left, if he agreed to leave Ms Brooks alone. Right, Neville Thurlbeck says reporters investigated MPs, Watson claims

Mr Watson quotes claims by the 
paper’s former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck that a team of reporters
was charged with investigating the private life of members of the 
Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.

‘There
was an edict that came down from the editor and it was “find out every 
single thing you can about every single member,’ Mr Thurlbeck is quoted 
as saying. ‘Who was gay, who had affairs, anything we can use. Each 
reporter was given two members and there were six reporters.’

Mr
Watson quotes the gay Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price, who said: ‘I was told 
by a senior Conservative member of the committee, who I knew was in 
direct contact with executives at News International, that if we went 
for her, they would go for us - effectively they would delve into our 
personal lives in order to punish [us].’

Mr Watson says this alleged intimidation was initially successful and contributed to a decision not to summon Mrs Brooks to give evidence in 2010.

‘I am sorry to say that this tactic was successful, the committee's legitimate investigation was undermined and parliament was, in effect, intimidated,’ he writes. ‘News International thought it could do this, that they would get away with it, that no one could touch them, and they actually did it, and it worked.’

Mrs Brooks has subsequently given evidence as the committee’s probe widened.

Mr Watson says two intermediaries approached him as the inquiry continued with a view to striking a deal.

‘Two intermediaries close to News International offered a deal. One told Watson the company would “give him” Andy Coulson, but Rebekah Brooks was “sacred”,’ says the book.

Mr Watson says he fell out with News International after he turned against Tony Blair, a politician the newspaper group supported. He says the stress of his investigations cost him his marriage.

Mr Watson claims a female ‘intermediary’ from News International, also asked him if he would like to meet Rupert Murdoch for dinner to thrash out their differences.

She allegedly told him: ‘He's a charismatic man. He'd want to square off these difficulties and put matters right.’

Watson says he was not interested in cutting a deal.

A spokesman for News International said the group has no comment on Mr Watson's allegations about intermediaries or surveillance.
