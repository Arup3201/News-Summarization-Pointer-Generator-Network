The Church of Scientology has vehemently denied claims made in a sensational new book that Tom Cruise auditioned a host of Hollywood beauties including Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Kate Bosworth to be his wife before settling on Katie Holmes.

Allegedly disappointed by his split from Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz in 2004 after she failed to embrace Scientology, Cruise, 50, allowed senior members of the church to summon the unwitting stars to read for a non-existent part in the 'Mission: Impossible' series.

According to 'Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison Belief', the Top Gun star initiated the unusual casting couch-style marriage interviews after a complaint to his sister at a Scientology church opening in Madrid that no one had been able to find him a new girlfriend.

Actresses Kate Bosworth and Lindsay Lohan were also reportedly considered for the role of Tom Cruise's wife and were asked to attend casting for a bogus role in a new Mission Impossible film

The Hollywood mega-star also allegedly made the same complaint to Scientologist leader and his best friend David Miscavige after his three year relationship with Cruz ended, who according to the book wasted no time in beginning the search for a suitable Mrs. Cruise.

Lawyers for Tom Cruise have vehemently insisted that no such conversations ever occurred while he was in Spain.

However, the tell-all book, penned by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Lawrence Wright, alleges that Scientologist matchmakers arranged for 'auditions' at the organisation's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles and invited the bevy of what were young and promising actresses.

The book claims that each of the girls including hell-raiser Lohan, who was 18 in 2004, Alba, who is now happily married with two children and Johansson, were not chosen and in 2005 Cruise instead met Katie Holmes and then infamously jumped on Oprah Winfrey's couch.

Holmes, who is now 34, split from Tom cruise in 2012 and took primary custody of their child, Suri.

The book also claims that prior to the auditions of the would-be stars, Cruise was hooked up with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who is now 32.

Vanity Fair magazine's special correspondent Maureen Orth reported that Shelly Miscavige, the wife of David Miscavige was part of the search to find Tom Cruise a suitable girlfriend.

The magazine contended that Boniadi was convinced by Scientology leaders that she had been selected for a project that would help further her religion and would lead to her meeting 'world leaders' and having an influential role in the church.

Allegedly, top Scientology official Greg Wilhere told the actress to darken her hair, remove her orthodontic braces and that she break up with her long term boyfriend, who was also part of the controversial religion and with whom she was reportedly deeply in love.

When she refused to do that, Wilhere allegedly showed Boniadi evidence that her boyfriend had cheated on her and that led her to break up their relationship.

Tom Cruise allegedly became disappointed by the break down in his relationship with Penelope Cruz in 2004 and asked Scientologist leader David Miscavige (right) for his help

She was flown to New York to meet Cruise and he swept her off her feet with an amazing series of dates that included visits to the Empire State Building, dinner at Nobu, skating at the Rockefeller Center and nights spent at the Trump Tower.

In fact, she so impressed Cruise that he asked her to sign a nondisclosure agreement, which is generally acknowledged to be a sign that the actor is keen to persue the relationship and make it serious.

Tommy Davis, a Scientology executive, told Boniadi that her new life with Cruise was all about keeping him happy.

'Davis warned her that if she did anything to upset Cruise, he would personally destroy her,' the book reported.

'Davis and (Scientology official) Jessica Feshback were constantly tutoring her in how to behave toward the star.'

The auditions for the role of Tom Cruise's new wife allegedly took place at the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles

However, the pairing did not work out and Feshback is said to have ordered Boniadi to pack her belongings and leave Cruise's home.

She is said to have last seen the Hollywood actor working out in his home gym and has never heard from him again.

And when she confessed her love for Cruise to another Scientologist, the church sent her to Clearwater in Florida and asked her to scrub public toilets with a toothbrush, the book reported.

The church has denied all allegations of cruelty towards Boniadi for speaking to anyone about Tom Cruise.

The reason for the unusual auditions organised by the Church of Sceintology stem from their interest in keeping their best known member happy.

He is also a huge donor to the religion, reportedly handing over $3 million in 2004 alone.

Before his marriage to Holmes, Cruise and Miscavige harbored political ambitions for the actor, alleges the book.

'If f******g Arnold (Schwarzenegger) can be governor, I could be President,' said Cruise.

'Well, absolutely, Tom,' replied Miscavige.

Lawyers for Cruise have denied that converstaion ever took place.

The book also details Cruise's failed attempts to try and recruit Steven Spielberg into the Scientology fold after the Oscar winning director cast the actor in 'War of the Worlds'.

However, Cruise became angered after her learnt of a conversation between Spielberg and Paul Haggis, the director of the Oscar winning movie 'Crash'.

'I've met all these Scientologists, and they seem like the nicest people,' Spielberg is alleged to have said reports the New York Daily News.

'Yea, we keep all the evil ones in the closet,' replied Haggis, who at the time was a Scientologist before leaving the church in 2009.

Haggis says that he was called in by the church executives for a dressing down over the remarks and ordered to write a letter of apology to Cruise.

When his first draft was rejected, Haggis was made to write an even more contrite letter to Tom Cruise.

A Spielberg publicist said the director doesn’t recall the brief exchange with Haggis, and Cruise’s lawyer said the actor does not remember the incident.
