England are refusing to rule Manu Tuilagi out of next month's autumn internationals despite Leicester insisting his groin injury will prevent him playing any role.

Tigers director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, is adamant Tuilagi will not be involved in any of the Tests against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia after limping off against Ulster on Saturday.

The 23-year-old centre was omitted from the 33-man squad for the QBE Series picked by head coach Stuart Lancaster, but tellingly his name was also missing from the list of injured players not considered for selection.

Tuilagi was outstanding against the All Blacks during England's three-Test tour in New Zealand last summer 

While the opener against New Zealand on November 8 and the clash with South Africa seven days later are clearly beyond Tuilagi, Lancaster has raised hopes that he may be involved beyond that.

'The reason we brought Jonathan Joseph into the camp is that Manu won't be fit for the start of the series, but we have not shut the door,' said Lancaster, who retains Chris Robshaw as captain for the autumn.

'It could take six weeks but we'll never say never. It's a joint management programme between us and Leicester and between us we have to get it right.

'The most important person in all of this is Manu and we have to make sure we get his rehabilitation right and get him some game time.

'There's no definitive timeline. It's not that sort of injury.'

Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni is one of three uncapped players included in the 33, with Lancaster revealing his promotion at the expense of Chris Ashton offers England similar game-breaking ability to Tuilagi.

Fijian-born Rokoduguni, a lance-corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, has been devastating at the Recreation Ground this season and Lancaster views him as a contender to start against the All Blacks.

'We're keen to get working with him because he's been outstanding for Bath,' Lancaster said.

'When you lose someone like Manu, Roko comes into the equation because of his impact in collisions, his ability to beat defenders and carry the ball over the gainline. He's a finisher as well.'

Even allowing for the raw promise offered by Rokoduguni, Tuilagi's power will be missed next month and his absence leaves a gaping hole in England's backline.

Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni has earned an England call-up after scoring six tries in seven matches 

Inside centre in particular and the midfield combination in general have long been the source of headaches for England, although Lancaster hints that Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt will be paired against New Zealand.

'I wouldn't say the centres are an area of concern,' Lancaster said.

'Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond have both been outstanding and you have Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees there as well. There's plenty of competition.

'Then there is Jonathan Joseph who is perhaps the form centre of all of them.

'It's about balance - you want a balance of pace, power and footballing ability.

'We will see them head to head (in training) and we will make our decisions on the combinations.'

High-profile omissions from the 33 are Danny Cipriani and Freddie Burns with Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler chosen as the squad's three fly-halves.

'I wouldn't say Danny's gone backwards,' Lancaster said.

'Stephen Myler was very unlucky not to start the first Test against New Zealand in June - he would have done had he not played in the Premiership final.

'Stephen Myler has the best skills execution, has played in big games and deserves his chance.

'Freddie and Danny have done well in games this season, but we've gone for the consistency that Stephen has shown and the attacking prowess of George Ford, while Owen's inclusion is merited on what he's done in the past.'

Centre Billy Twelvetrees and wing Jonny May are present despite enduring mixed tours to New Zealand in the summer.

Northampton flanker Calum Clark features among the six back rows, while George Kruis is included in a senior England squad for the first time.
