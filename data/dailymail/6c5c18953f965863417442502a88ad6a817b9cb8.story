Imprisoned documents 
leaker Chelsea Manning says she'll go to court, if necessary, to get 
treatment for gender identity disorder, also called gender dysphoria.

The
Army private formerly known as Bradley Manning wrote in a letter to the
Private Manning Support Network that her court-martial defense 
attorney, David Coombs, is helping her seek treatment for the disorder 
at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, a men's military prison at Fort 
Leavenworth, Kansas. The support group posted the October 28 letter on its 
website Wednesday.

Manning is serving a 
35-year sentence for sending more than 700,000 secret military and State
Department documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks while 
working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq.

Manning,
25, wrote that she wants to at least be allowed to live as a woman and 
receive hormone replacement therapy.

She said Coombs will represent her 
in those efforts 'by assisting me in matters related to exhausting my 
administrative remedies and, if denied outright, in filing a writ before
a court with jurisdiction.'

Coombs said 
Thursday he had nothing to add to Manning's comments. After Manning 
announced her request in August, Coombs said he hoped the military 
prison would 'do the right thing' so Manning wouldn't have to go to 
court.

The military has said it does not 
provide treatment for gender dysphoria. Pentagon policy dictates that 
transgender soldiers are not allowed to serve, but Manning can't be 
discharged until she's released from prison and exhausts appeals of her 
criminal convictions.

The Army Medical Command has said prisoners cannot
receive hormone treatment at Fort Leavenworth, though Manning is 
apparently the first to request it. Prison officials have said Manning 
won't be allowed to dress as a woman.

Manning 
was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by two Army behavioral health 
specialists before her trial, but the Army has said prisoners must be 
re-evaluated.

Fort Leavenworth spokeswoman Kimberly Lewis said the prison cannot release inmate medical information due to privacy laws.

Manning
also wrote that Coombs will help her file a petition for a formal name 
change from Bradley to Chelsea. Prison officials have said name changes 
are allowed.

The letter was one of four from 
Manning that the support network published. In another, she apologized 
for an earlier public statement in which she rejected the 'pacifist' 
label after receiving the 2013 Sean MacBride Peace Award.

Manning wrote 
in her apology that her decision to leak classified information 
reflected her 'dedication to transparency' and a concern for human life 
and equality.
