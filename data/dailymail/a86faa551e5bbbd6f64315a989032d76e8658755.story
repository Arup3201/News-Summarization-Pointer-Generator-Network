The sun's out, the school holidays are starting, and young daredevils in a British holiday resort have come up with a new adrenaline sport: tightrope-walking across the harbour.

Youngsters in the Cornish fishing village of Mousehole stretched a rope 50ft across the harbour entrance and filmed their - not always successful - attempts to walk across it.

A video posted onto YouTube shows one teenage boy manage to make the crossing, and several others tiptoeing across the rope before losing their balance and plummeting 25ft to the water below.

It seems a slightly less dangerous option than the old craze of jumping into the sea from a cliff or other high point, also known as tombstoning.

The dangerous craze claims lives every summer, despite warnings from authorities about the potential risks.

or No one knows who is behind the new craze but the video, which has been watched by 2,500 people, was produced by Abdel Bakrim.
