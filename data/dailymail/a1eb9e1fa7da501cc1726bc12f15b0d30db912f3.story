A boy aged ten has accidentally shot and killed his five-year-old brother with a gun he found at his home in Belleville, Illinois.

The brothers were being looked after by a male babysitter while their parents were out at the time of the shooting.

It's the third time in little over a week that a child in the St Louis area has died after picking up a gun they found in the house.

Shooting: The ten-year-old accidentally shot his five-year-old brother at a house in the first block of Glen Grove, Belleville, last night

The five-year-old died at around 8pm yesterday in what police described as an 'extremely tragic' accidental shooting.

He and his older brother were playing in a room next door to the babysitter when the man heard a shot

He ran in to find the five-year-old 
slumped on the floor. He called 911, but when police and paramedics 
arrived he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Belleville Police Chief Bill Clay said: 
'This was not a self-inflicted wound. We're still trying to determine 
how they got access to the weapon.'

Disturbing trend: There have been three accidental shootings involving children in the St Louis, Missouri area in little over a week

He said officers were investigating the shooting as an accident rather than a crime, and the boy's parents were cooperating.

They are questioning the ten-year-old too, but say he has not been detained.

He
told the St Louis Post-Dispatch: 'We're just looking to get to the 
bottom of this, to find out what happened, and to get all of the 
questions answered.'

Police have not released the boys' names, nor revealed to whom the gun belonged.

'Extremely tragic': Police gather on a street in Belleville, Illinois, where a ten-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed his younger brother

Raymond Chamberlin, a neighbour, said the family had lived at the neat one-storey house or about a year.

He didn't know them very well, but said they would often see the youngest boy outside and there would always be at least one adult watching over him.

He said: 'We'd see him riding around his driveway on his tricycle. A sweet little boy. His brother would be out there playing, too. 
They were a nice family. It's really a tragedy.'

Belleville Police Captain Don Sax warned all parents to keep firearms away from their children.

Second tragedy: Just last week Lilianna Moore, three, shot herself in the head after finding a gun hidden underneath a mattress at her home in St Louis

He said: '(Guns) have to be locked up. They have to be secured. Don't even have the possibility of having them someplace where children can get them.'

On Tuesday Daniel Metz, a police officer's son, died in hospital after he accidentally shot himself in the chest with his father's handgun at his home in Maryland Heights.

His father, Ryan, was one of the first officers on the scene, and watched distraught as his colleagues attempted in vain to resuscitate his little boy.

Last week three-year-old Lilianna Moore shot herself in the head after finding a gun hidden under a mattress in a bedroom at her home in St Louis while her father was out seeing his girlfriend.
