The Ashes were lost to England today with their third successive defeat by Australia but in the figure of Ben Stokes they at least can take considerable consolation from their failure to retain the most precious prize in cricket.

The 22-year-old from Durham, thrown into this series in Adelaide more in desperation than hope, struck a maiden Test century of considerable maturity to keep Australia waiting for a moment of triumph that had seemed guaranteed.

England, so bereft of runs from all their leading batsmen so far, went into the final day of the third Test needing a miracle if they were to pull off the highest successful run chase in the history of Test cricket.

Yet for the morning session at least 
that dream was kept alive by a performance of the highest class from a 
genuine all-rounder who also proved himself England’s fastest bowler in 
this otherwise hugely disappointing match.

Stokes
showed up the inadequacies of senior players who have consistently 
under-performed in Australia by taking on Mitchell Johnson and company 
without offering the kind of reckless strokes that have done for his 
colleagues.

While there was 
Stokes, born in New Zealand to a rugby league professional who made his 
life with his family in Cumbria, there was hope for England as he batted
calmly but with authority in company with Matt Prior.

And
as England’s quest to make 504 was whittled down to a target of fewer 
than 200 Australians became ever so slightly twitchy, a sure sign the tourists have missed a huge opportunity here by failing to put them under
pressure.

It is no 
exaggeration to say that Prior, for one, is playing for his future after
a dismal summer and now winter but he played well until yet another 
brainstorm and yet another bad shot to gift Johnson his 
wicket.

Stokes was 
undeterred and moved to a century that could provide the launching pad 
for a long England career before lunch, celebrating with commendable 
moderation because of the seriousness of his team's plight.

England
went to the interval having added 81 in the first session for the loss 
of just Prior, leaving them 172 still to get with four wickets left, but
the break allowed Australia to regroup and they returned once again the
dominant side.

Stokes had 
played Nathan Lyon with considerable aplomb but when he under-edged a 
sweep to give the impressive Brad Haddin another catch the writing was 
on the wall. He left to huge applause from a disappointing 
WACA crowd consisting of more England fans than Australians.

Eight centuries have been scored in this Ashes series - and seven of them have been by Australians.

England
soon reverted to their woeful type when Graeme Swann gave it away and 
then when Tim Bresnan punched Johnson to a diving Chris Rogers at 
mid-off Australia were on the brink of their first Ashes win since 2006.

Victory
was complete for Australia, by a margin of 150 runs, when Jimmy 
Anderson was caught at short leg, appropriately, off Johnson, who has 
been the single biggest difference between these teams. What a contrast 
from the last series here three years ago when he was little more than a
figure of fun to the Barmy Army.

Australia
were ecstatic and who could blame them. The extent of their superiority
here has been both emphatic and surprising and they are worthy winners 
of a prize that has eluded them for seven years.

So
Stokes may have provided England with a crumb of comfort but this has 
been an abject series for them and they must now embark on a period of 
considerable soul-searching before the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

Edge of reason: Matt Prior wafts his bat at a Johnson delivery and is caught behind

Joy and despair: Johnson (left) celebrates dismissing Prior as the England batsman walks off

Running the show: Johnson has a burst of speed after getting Prior and is pursued by Warner (left), Smith (second right) and Bailey (right)

Turf luck: Johnson was fortunate to avoid injury after he caught his knee in the grass on the outfield

At a stretch: Stokes dives for his ground to avoid being run out on 91

Diving Dave: Warner is at full stretch to stop the ball going for runs

The
urn has gone, spectacularly and dramatically, after three Tests of 
their attempt to win their fourth successive Ashes series and the 
planning must start now for the next series in England which comes round
the summer after next.

Before
that they must attempt to avoid the fate of Andrew Flintoff’s side here
seven years ago who were whitewashed 5-0 by an aggressive Australia 
hell-bent on revenge for their narrow defeat in the famous series of 
2005.

That was a truly great
Australian side whereas this one is not so England have no shortage of 
motivation in the final two Tests of this series to avoid what would be 
an even greater humiliation.

Thanks
to a cricketer who has more than a bit of Flintoff about him in Stokes, they at least have one young player they can include in what is 
now destined to be a painful rebuilding programme.
