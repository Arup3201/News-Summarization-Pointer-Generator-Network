Former Arsenal star Robert Pires was allegedly punched during an Indian Super League game on Thursday.

FC Goa are set to to file an official report with the league's governing body regarding allegations that their marquee player was attacked in the tunnel at half-time by Atletico de Kolkata coach Antonio Lopez Habas as the teams came off the pitch.

Pires, who was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' squad which went unbeaten throughout the 2003-04 Premier League season en route to winning the title, was heavily involved in Goa's 2-1 home defeat.

Atletico co-owner Utsav Parekh meanwhile insisted his side would send their own report to the ISL regarding the allegations.

The game, played in the Goan capital Margao, featured seven yellow cards, while Atletico goalkeeping coach Deshi Bakhtaver was also sent to the stands.

Goa coach Zico, a World Cup winner with Brazil, told the Indian media at a post-match press conference: 'One of our players said that he was beaten by the coach of the other team.

'Pires said he was punched in the face by the Atletico coach and it is very shameful.

'I am telling you what my players told me and I didn't see that myself but I don't think that Pires would lie and say something that didn't happen.

'And when the team entered the field in the second half, they were very nervous and during the half-time we were only trying to control their nerves and calm them down.'

FC Goa released a statement on Friday evening confirming they had reported the various incidents from the match and called for strong action from Indian football's governing body.

Goa's media manager Rhys Mascarenhas said: 'The team manager of FC Goa Mr Jonathan D'Sousa has complained to the match commissioner that the referee should have expelled Atletico de Kolkata player Fikru Tefera Lemessa for headbutting FC Goa player Gregory Arnolin at the match.

'Mr D'Sousa has also complained to the match commissioner regarding the assault by the head coach of Atletico de Kolkata, on FC Goa's marquee player Robert Pires in the area in front of the players dressing rooms during the half-time interval.

'The team manager of team FC Goa has requested that the disciplinary committee take strong disciplinary action against the players and officials of Atletico de Kolkata for their violent conduct.'

Responding to the allegations, Parekh told www.telegraphindia.com: 'Look, none of us were present on the spot when the alleged incident took place. So it wouldn't be proper for us to comment on who's right and who's wrong.

'We are writing to the ISL about it and we expect them to investigate the matter and come out with the truth.

'CCTV footage is available and so it will not be very difficult to establish the truth. Whatever the incident, one can find that out from the CCTV footage. So we will not be commenting on what Zico has said, we will wait for the ISL to investigate the matter first.'

Atletico de Kolkata, who are co-owned by La Liga side Atletico Madrid, are the current leaders in the inaugural ISL season with 10 points from four games, with FC Goa in sixth place.

A spokesperson for the ISL confirmed both clubs had been in touch over the allegations with the matter now being escalated to the disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).

Kolkata and Goa are traditional powerhouses of Indian club football, with their rivalry evident from the start of the game, which also saw former Arsenal man Andre Santos score for FC Goa in the first half.

Players had been involved in heated exchanges leading up to the half-time whistle, though it is not yet clear what sparked the alleged incident involving Pires and Habas.

ISL spokesperson Leeladhar Singh said: 'Both clubs have submitted written letters. The disciplinary committee at the AIFF is reviewing the incident.

'They will pronounce the verdict as and when the conclusion is made from the evidence. The AIFF disciplinary committee will look at the evidence as well as the letters (submitted by both clubs).

'It would be too early to predict what the outcome will be. The AIFF will look at all the evidence. They are looking into all the aspects.'
