It's a struggle for most to get a seat on the Tube at rush hour, but an unlikely passenger managed just that this week.

A ginger cat left commuters astounded when he boarded a Victoria Line train and beat his fellow passengers to a seat.

The tom travelled 10 stops, between Seven Sisters and Vauxhall, before he was eventually coaxed into a cat carrier by a Paige Jokovic, a volunteer from the nearby Battersea Dogs and Cats Home who happened to be on the same train.

The cat has since been taken in by the animal charity and named, rather fittingly, Oyster - after the smartcard used to swipe in and out of the Underground.

Paige said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw Oyster sitting on a seat on the Tube, and I thought at first he was a teddy bear.

'Everyone around him was just staring like they’d never seen a cat before.

No chip: The cat has now been taken in by Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and will be rehomed if its owner is not found

'Thankfully, I had a cat carrier with me as I had to pick my own cat up from the vets in the evening.

'We both took the Tube to Vauxhall and I’m very pleased I was there to help him get off the Tube, minding the gap, and escort him to Battersea.'

Lindsey Quinlan, Battersea’s head of cattery, said: 'Oyster is very lucky to have been found on the Tube by Paige who was able to bring him to Battersea.

'We take in cats which have been found in appalling conditions in unusual places including bins and boxes, but Oyster is a healthy, happy boy who appears to have been simply making his way to central London.

'Oyster doesn’t have a microchip, so if nobody comes forward to collect him, he will be rehomed and hopefully not try to take a trip on the Tube by himself again.'

Battersea Dogs and Cats Home was originally founded in 1860 and started accepted cats in 1883.

Each year, the home takes care of more than 10,600 animals.
