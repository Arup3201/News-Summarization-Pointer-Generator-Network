Two neighbours from hell told a pensioner suffering from terminal cancer to 'hurry up and die' during a campaign of abuse that left her too terrified to leave the house.

Martin Ward and Lisa Stokes subjected grandmother Olive Howes, 74, to vile taunts as he battled her illness.

They would 'bang their furniture 
against the floor, play loud music and pour buckets of 
cold water so it would leak into her flat,' a court heard.

When she complained about the noise, they told her to 'hurry up and die.'

Mrs Ward, who lived in the flat below, today told of her relief after Ward and Stokes, both 48, were handed an Asbo by magistrates banning them from shouting at neighbours for five years.

She said: 'They would shout vile abuse at me everytime I left the house. I go to shopping twice a week but as soon as they’d see me, they’d be up in my face, screaming.

'It got to the point where I couldn’t leave the house without someone picking me up or taking me back, I couldn’t go out on my own because they’d be waiting for me.'

'Over the moon': Grandmother Olive Howes (pictured left and outside her flat) says she hopes to get peace after her tormentors were handed Asbos banning them from shouting at their neighbours

The couple were ordered to pay £2,758 costs and given a strict list of 'behave yourself' rules, including not shouting at any neighbours.

Mrs Howes, from Blackwood near Newport, South Wales, said: 'I’m over the moon now - I never thought they’d get a five-year Asbo. Five years is a long time and hopefully I will finally get some peace.'

Pc Gareth Jones said: 'I hope this Asbo provides respite for Mrs Howes, her family and the wider community.

'The type of behaviour committed by Stokes and Ward against a very vulnerable victim made this order a necessity.

'This is not only to protect the victim in this case but also her family and the wider community.'
