Her six-year-old son turned his nose up at sandwiches and sticks of carrot. So Grace Hall transformed them into aliens, elephants and superheroes.

Now he cannot wait to open his packed lunch every day and tuck into his favourite characters.

With the help of a few cutters and moulds, former accountant Mrs Hall has turned sandwiches into Spiderman, hard-boiled eggs into sheep and melons into Easter chicks...while making hundreds of healthy lunches.

Her blog, Eats Amazing, showing photographs of the culinary creations, is followed by 7,500 other mothers.

Grace Hall, 32, creates works of art - such as this Angry Birds-inspired one, a current favourite - for her son's packed lunch

Grace was worried about her son's appetite and started preparing to the pretty lunches in an effort to get him to eat more

The 32-year-old, from Winchester, was inspired by the bento-style lunch boxes seen in Japan, traditionally created from sushi rice, meat and fish and sometimes turned into fun characters and cartoons.

The artistic mother goes to incredible lengths to delight her six year old, turning sandwiches into Spiderman, Santa and the Very Hungry Caterpillar.

Grace says she usually spends only a few minutes on each lunchbox

Grace says that she spends a little longer on lunchboxes for special occasions, such as this Easter one

Grace says she never buys specialist ingredients and just uses what's left around the house

She 
fashions snails from a bread roll decorated with cheese for eyes, 
carrots carved into flowers and a cheese and ham toastie that looks like
 a pig.

Other characters creations include Elmer 
the Elephant, the Gruffalo, Thomas the Tank Engine, Goldilocks and the 
Funny Bones skeletons.

For Grace, the novelty lunches come to her naturally as she remembers her own mother using fruit to make faces in homemade bread when she was a child.

Although this may sound like a lot of time and effort, Grace says they can suit mums in a hurry as she never spends more than 15 minutes creating the lunches.

Grace insists that she enjoys the daily tasks and has turned a potential chore into something she looks forward to doing. She has even admitted to actually missing her creations during school holidays.

Above all, Grace tries to make each lunch as healthy as possible

Since she started creating the lunch boxes, Grace's son has gained much more of an appetite

Grace asks her son to make special requests to give her inspiration

'I could see years of endless lunch-packing stretching ahead of me.

'But I soon found they were a great outlet for my own creativity - as a full-time mum I get very little time for myself.

'So making lunches is a way for me to turn an everyday chore into an opportunity to get creative.'

Grace, who had been worried about her son's lack of appetite, says that since she has created the bento-style lunches she has seen a real improvement in his eating.

Grace was inspired by the bento boxes of Japan, which are broken up into different compartments

Her creations, posted on her blog, have gained the former accountant a loyal following of 7,500 readers

Grace's husband has even been involved in the project, helping her out after the birth of their second son

'My son was never a big eater before.

'I
 used to worry about the amount of food he ate - or rather didn't eat - 
but  since I started making bento-style lunches, his appetite has grown.

'These days he is much more enthusiastic about his food and will eat pretty much everything - except celery.'

She says that her artistic lunches have also helped other mums who have had trouble getting their kids to eat their lunches.

'The best comments on my blog come from mums who say their children have started eating foods they wouldn't touch before.

'To think that I am inspiring others and helping them to get their children eating healthy food makes me very happy.'

Grace's son is, unsurprisingly, thrilled with his lunches and Grace  asks her son - nicknamed 'Small Child' in her blog - for ideas and requests.

Grace has created more than 300 different lunches - such as this football-themed one - for her son

Grace uses leftovers from the family dinners to make sure nothing goes to waste

Grace gains inspiration from her son's story books - this one has a knight's theme, complete with sandwich cut to look like a castle and cucumber and carrot 'shields'

His current favourite lunches feature Angry Birds, dinosaurs and cats and will now happily polish off veg, including striped beetroot and purple carrots.

'My son really loves the lunches.

'I make them while he is eating his breakfast and he is always peering over my shoulder, interested in what I am making for him each day.

'I know I've made a good one if he says it's cool.'

A set of themed lunches, like those based on her son's favourite tales for World Book Day, St George's Day or Comic Relief, requires extra thought and may take longer than her 15-minute time limit.

Grace remembers her mum making her novelty lunches when she was younger

Grace has inspired other mothers who are having trouble getting their children to eat

Staff at her son's school keep a keen eye out for the latest creations

'Occasionally I give a lunch a little 
extra time if it's a special theme or occasion but I truly believe it's 
not much more than traditional lunches.'

Rather than buying  special ingredients, Grace just keeps a good variety of fresh fruit and vegetables in the house, making the lunches healthy for her son.

A list of food ideas stuck on the family fridge helps ensure each lunch has at least one portion of vegetable, fruit, dairy, carbohydrates and protein.

Leftovers such as spare tortilla wraps or potatoes from a dinner are put to good use in the lunchboxes, and sweets and crisps are kept to a minimum.

Grace's son eagerly watches his mother prepare his meals every day

Grace says she knows when she's made a good lunch when her son describes them as 'cool'

Creativelu used Babybells, as above, are a regular theme in the lunchboxes

Grace's husband has even jumped aboard the project, helping to make the lunches after their second son was born.

'My husband made a brilliant lunch that was farm themed. I loved the fact he had a style of his own, despite using the same supplies and accessories as me.

'My son was very pleased, I think he was impressed by Daddy's efforts and really enjoyed the novelty.'

It comes as no surprise that staff at Grace's son's school said they loved seeing what was in his daily lunch box and they have inspired parents at the school gate to follow her lead.

The project has inspired Grace to study nutrition in the future.
