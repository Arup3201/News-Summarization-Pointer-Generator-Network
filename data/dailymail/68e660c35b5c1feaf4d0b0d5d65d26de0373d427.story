The only thing most teenagers have to worry about is going to school and their friends.

But in 2007 at the age of 16, Joey Lynch was in a hospital bed after he had just been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, deciding whether or not to freeze his sperm so he could have the chance to have children in the future.

Due to the treatments he has received since then - including chemotherapy, total body radiation and two stem-cell transplants - the now 22-year-old's reproductive system is no longer viable. 

Joey Lynch (pictured here with a friend in 2013) was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at 16 years of age

He said this was not a decision he had even thought about when he was diagnosed until a nurse suggested it.

'When she suggested it I wasn't take aback because I had been in hospital for three days already. I thought it was a smart thing to do,' Mr Lynch told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was a very important [decision]. I wasn't in a relationship at the time but it wasn't at the forefront of mind.

'You have no idea what the treatment will do to you.

Three days after his diagnosis, Mr Lynch (pictured here in 2009) made the decision to freeze his sperm to give him the best chance of having children in the future

'I'm that age now that I see my friends and family members having babies on Facebook and Instagram.

'It’s not going to be a pleasant experience with IVF but I'm glad I have that chance than no chance at all.'

Go see your GP if one or more of these symptoms are persistent or unexplained:

These are only one of the many issues Mr Lynch had to consider as a young cancer patient, which is more common than most people think.

Every day another three young Australians aged 15 to 25 are diagnosed with cancer.

Mr Lynch said when he found out he had cancer he was 'obviously shocked'.

'It was a kick in the guts. It's not something you anticipate hearing when you go to the doctor,' he said.

'Until you actually get it and realise the amount of young people with cancer, you never think of young people and cancer, it never crosses your mind.'

In the days after he was diagnosed, Mr Lynch said he thought about how he was going to make it through high school and other study plans - whether or not part-time study and distance education were options.

Mr Lynch, who is now 22, is still being treated for lymphoma and a disease called Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), where his stem-cell transplant's immune cells are attacking his body

Due to his cancer and GVHD, Mr Lynch has been in and out of hospital since 2007 - when he was diagnosed.  He is now treated at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne - Australia's only public hospital solely dedicated to cancer treatment

He also worried about how his cancer would affect his bone density, which may prevent him from returning to sports, and survival rates.

'[Death is] always at the back of your mind, even though you don't want to acknowledge it,' he said.

'You're worrying about mortality rates of lymphoma, what is the mortality rate of healthy people my age. You try to find out about mortality rates as much as possible.'

It was not just the long-term things Mr Lynch thought about but also the short-term like losing his hair and getting a job.

'I thought... am I going to lose my hair and the way I looked,' he said.

'I was in the ward with other adults and they didn't look very healthy. They had lost a lot of weight and I was worried all this stuff.

'I thought with jobs that 16-year-olds can get they're [employees] probably not going to bend over backwards [to arrange shifts] around chemo appointments.'

He said freezing his sperm was the last thing on his mind when he was 16, but is glad he did it

He said other things he thought about when he was in his hospital bed was how he was going to finish school and whether or not he was going to lose his hair and weight

Mr Lynch - who hopes to study exercise science - is still in the treatment stage of his lymphoma but is also being treated for Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), where his donor immune cells from his stem-cell transplant are attacking his body.

It is an indefinite disease that leaves him susceptible to infection and landed him in hospital a number of times - once even in intensive care.

When asked how he deals with his illness, Mr Lynch said it had put a lot of things into perspective for him.

'I'm always trying to ensure that I don't make anything bigger than it needs to be,' he said.

'I make sure that I keep things in my life to look forward to and plan for that aren't related to cancer; be they CanTeen experiences, sporting events to attend, opportunities to hang out with friends or even simply my next workout.

'Nothing in life has to be a huge thing unless you allow it to be, including cancer.

'That's a vital skill I feel young people lack - the ability to properly determine what is under ones control and what is not, what should be worried about and what shouldn't be worried about.'

Mr Lynch hopes to study exercise science at university and urges young people who may have cancer to get diagnosed as soon as they can

As for young people who unsure or scared to see the doctor, Mr Lynch said it was better safe than sorry.

'There’s no points for finding out you have cancer too late but there are a heck a lot of points for discovering cancer in the early stages,' he said.

'If you think something is wrong get it checked out.'

In her 12 years as a oncologist, Antoinette Anazodo - from NSW/ACT Youth Cancer Service - said cancer sufferers between 15 and 25 rarely bring up the issue of fertility.

Dr Anazodo is the service's lead clinician and is working to establish the Australasian Oncofertility Registry by collecting data from cancer and fertility specialists for the development of evidence-based national guidelines.

'For a majority of patients in this age range, it still comes as a surprise. Fertility preservation is not openly discussed,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'When they think of cancer diagnosis or treatment, it's not even on their radar. It's usually vomiting, losing their hair or losing weight.

'It's a double whammy for them - it's the cancer diagnosis as well as fertility.'

Dr Anazodo said more cancer specialists needed to discuss this issue with their patients.
