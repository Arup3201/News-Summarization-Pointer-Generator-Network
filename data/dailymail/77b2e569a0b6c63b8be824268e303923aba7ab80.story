It has become one of Britain's most closely guarded secrets.

But now it is in the hands of 62,000 people lucky enough last night to watch a dress rehearsal of Danny Boyle's extravagant £27million Opening Ceremony that will spark London 2012 to life.

Fans invited to the sneak preview in the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, were urged personally by the Slumdog Millionaire director to 'save the surprise' for the one billion around the world who will watch on Friday night.

Sssssh! Crowds leave the Olympic Stadium at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, following the dress rehearsal last night under strict orders not to give away any details

Organisers invited London 2012 volunteers, competition winners and others connected to the Games on the proviso that they kept quiet about what they saw.

The ceremony’s artistic director Danny
 Boyle addressed the huge crowd and called on them to reveal nothing ahead of Friday’s showpiece by not posting any images on 
social networks.

The 
hashtag #savethesurprise was also emblazoned on giant screens inside the
 Olympic Stadium, according to people at the event, before trending 
globally on twitter.

It is already common knowledge that the stadium has been transformed into a British rural idyll.

The stadium will be packed with at least
 62,000 spectators, 16,000 athletes, 10,000 performers, 70 sheep, 12 
horses, ten chickens, three cows, two goats and even dogs and geese.

Traditional
 countryside cottages will stand together with a mining wheel, harking 
back to the country's proud industrial heritage, all drenched in faked 
pouring rain to reflect Britain's typical weather.

And
 mimicking scenes across the country every weekend, a cricket pitch has 
even been laid with a game planned for during the ceremony.

But in the main the contents of the three hour multi-million pound extravaganza is still a complete mystery.

Movie director Boyle and his creative team have done their best to keep details of the opening ceremony secret and it seemed that most spectators at last night’s rehearsal followed their wishes by not revealing any of the shows big surprises. Many took to Twitter to show their support.

Dan McNeil tweeted: 'I am now sitting on my seat in the Olympic Stadium. But I shall #savethesurprise and not tweet details of the ceremony. Sorry.'

While Prashant Mistry wrote on the micro blogging website: 'I have to #savethesurprise, but today's opening ceremony dress rehearsal was epic! you guys are in for a treat on Friday!'

The event, which is expected to be watched in the majority of countries worldwide, received hundreds of other glowing reviews from those lucky enough to be at the rehearsal.

Pete Hendrick tweeted: 'If you’ve got plans Friday night, cancel them. Opening ceremony is out of this world. Danny Boyle, I salute you.'

Tamsin Slater added: 'Made me really proud to be British. Danny Boyle thank you and to everyone taking part you’re fantastic #savethesurprise.'

Chris Golds was another to tweet his approval, writing: 'Breathtaking. Can’t put it into words. Spectacular, clever, charming, moving & awe inspiring. Made me so proud. @London2012 #SaveTheSurprise.'

Labour MP David Miliband also took to the website to reveal he was among the audience.

After the rehearsal he tweeted: 'Danny Boyle is a genius with a wicked sense of humour.'

Meanwhile a lump  of rock, known as 'nowhere island', is being towed  to Britain from Norway for the opening ceremony of the sailing events of London 2012 in Weymouth.

The island has journeyed from the High Arctic region of Svalbard and was discovered by artist Alex Hartley. As the island passed out of the jurisdiction of Norway and into international waters, it was declared the worldís new nation with citizenship open to all.

Since then 3,000 
people have joined the 10,000 existing citizens of Nowhere island who 
have become a part of this pioneering public art project.

The small 
Arctic island will arrive on the British south coast tomorrow.

Big Ben is to chime non-stop for three minutes to help ring in the London 2012 Olympics.

Special permission had to be gained for the hour bell at the Palace of Westminster to be allowed to toll out of its regular sequence.

It will strike more than 42 times between 8.12am and 8.15am on July 27 to herald the beginning of the first day of Games.

It will be the first time Big Ben has been rung outside its regular schedule since February 15 1952, when it tolled every minute for 56 strokes from 9.30am for the funeral of King George VI.

The chiming for London 2012 will be a live performance as everything will have to be done by hand.

Mike McCann, Keeper of the Great Clock, said: 'We need to manually lift the brake that controls the weight that drives the mechanism that strikes Big Ben.'

The bells at the National Assembly for Wales, Stormont in Northern Ireland and the Scottish Parliament will also ring so that all four Parliaments will be chiming in unison at 8.12am, London 2012 said.

The event - titled All The Bells - will be the first big celebration to kick off the Games.

The idea is the brainchild of Turner Prize-winning artist and musician Martin Creed for the London 2012 Festival, who suggested all the bells in the country should be rung as loudly as possible for three minutes. He called it Work No 1197.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said: 'It is a sign of how special this summer is when one of the world's most famous bells will ring outside its regular schedule so it can be part of this London 2012 Festival commission to ring in the Olympic Games.'

The event aims to set a world record for the largest number of bells to be rung simultaneously and can include any from children with handbells, through people ringing bicycle bells and doorbells, to experienced change ringing experts of tower bells and church bells.

All The Bells will be the London 2012 Festival's biggest community celebration for the Games, according to Ruth Bells will be ringing everywhere from Britain's northernmost inhabited house in Skaw in the Shetland Isles, to the UK's most westerly church in Tresco in the Scilly Isles.
