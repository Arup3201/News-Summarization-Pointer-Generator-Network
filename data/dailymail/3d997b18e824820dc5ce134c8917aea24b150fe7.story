The woman who inspired the film An Education has admitted for the first time that she only realised decades after her relationship with a teacher that she had been groomed.

An Education is set in the 1960s but it was not until after 2000 that Lynn Barber, a renowned journalist, came to the realisation that what she initially thought was a love story was a peadophile grooming a young girl and conning her parents.

The story of David Goldman and Jenny Mellor was a hit - winning Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, a best actress BAFTA.

Carey Mulligan plays Jenny in An Education. Her character is based on Lynn Barber and her romance with teacher Alan Green. Peter Sarsgaard plays the teacher, called David Goldman in the film

In the film, a scene at Jenny's parents' shows Mr Goldman charming her parents and convincing them that he should marry her daughter.

But now Mrs Barber, who is behind its 
plot admits that in hindsight, that the teacher who she has referred to as Simon Goldman did not just charm 
her parents, they were groomed in the same way that she was.

In a piece in The Sunday Times Magazine she admitted that it was only in the early noughties when she heard the expression for the first time that the realisation of what had actually happened to her struck.

She wrote in the magazine: 'Yes, I believe he was a paedophile and that he groomed my parents to deliver me to him'.

Until recently, Mrs Barber had said that the older man's name was Simon Goldman but after his death she revealed that his real name was Alan Green.

The 2009 film was based on Lynn Barber's schoolgirl relationship with teacher Alan Green. She reveals in the piece that it was only after 2000 that she released she was groomed

Mrs Barber said that although Green was not by definition a peadophile because she was above the age of consent, she had been in a 'peadophile relationship'.

She said the attraction came from their difference in age. Mrs Barber admitted that she fell for the teacher because he was a grown-up. In turn, he was attracted to her position as a school girl.

Mrs Barber added: 'He relied on the fact that schoolgirls didn't question what grown-ups did.'

Mrs Barber is known for her hard-hitting
 interviewing technique and has interviewed names from Rafael Nadal to 
Marianna Faithful.

Years on, Mrs Barber admits that being duped by her former lover, never asking whether he was married or for his age, was not in keeping with her inquistive nature.

She wrote in the magazine that she had never forgiven Green and that, when she found out that he had died in 2013, she thought 'Phew'.
