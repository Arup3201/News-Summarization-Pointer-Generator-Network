A gay banker who strangled his wife with a vacuum cleaner pipe and burnt her body in an incinerator has revealed how he 'snapped' when she threatened to expose him.

Jasvir Ram Ginday, 30, is accused of murdering Varkha Rani on September 12 last year following a lavish wedding ceremony in India six months earlier.

The newlyweds were cleaning their 
family home when Ginday discovered Varkha packing her bags after he 
fetched her a vacuum cleaner, the court heard.

'Secret': Jasvir Ram Ginday, 30, told Wolverhampton Crown Court he knew he was gay when he was 12 but married Varkha Rani, 24, to make his parents happy

The 24-year-old told him she knew he was gay and could not stay any longer - prompting Ginday to push the pipe against her throat with 'moderate force'.

Giving evidence, Ginday insisted he 'definitely did love her' and did not mean to kill her.

But he admitted he only proposed to hide his sexuality from his parents, who would be 'shocked' and 'devastated' by the truth.

Opening the defence case, David Nathan QC said Ginday had snapped when his wife threatened to tell his friends and family that he was homosexual.

Mr Nathan QC said: 'She had discovered that he was gay and she tells him the last thing that he wanted to hear - I’m leaving you, I discovered it and I’m going to expose you for what you really are.

'He snapped and he applied too much pressure. He had no intention of killing her.'

Ginday told the jury he knew he was gay from the age of 12 but felt unable to tell his parents the truth because they would be 'shocked' and 'devastated'.

Having never been in a heterosexual relationship before, he travelled to India in October 2012 and met 15 potential wives, before asking Varkha to marry him on March 28.

Police found the charred remains of Varkha Rami the day after Ginday reported her missing

But just six months later, her charred remains were found by police at the couple’s home, the day after Ginday reported his wife missing.

Varkha - who had a bachelor's degree and a master’s degree in science and information technology from a university in India - came to the UK with her new husband in August.

Ginday admitted there were 'teething problems' to begin with and said their relationship never got intimate, but added: 'I definitely did love her.'

During the opening of his murder trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, jurors were told his sexuality had been a source of trauma throughout his life.

He went to see his doctor due to 
depression in 2010 or 2011 but was too uncomfortable to reveal his 
sexuality to the GP, the court heard.

And he carried out the brutal attack on his wife after she discovered his 'secret'.

The court also heard that during a police interview Ginday continuously denied having anything to do with his wife’s death and said he was 'devastated' by what had happened.

His barrister Mr Nathan QC said Ginday lied because he did not want to admit he had killed his wife.

Ginday told Wolverhampton Crown Court he was 'devastated' by her death and pleaded guilty to manslaughter

Earlier in the trial the court heard Ginday strangled his wife with a metal hoover pipe before forcing her body into the 22-inch deep back garden incinerator and setting her body alight.

He reported her missing and police attended the house but did not find her body until the next day when they became suspicious of black smoke billowing from the property.

Ginday was arrested and taken to the police station although he did not confirm if the body was his wife’s.

Pathologists later confirmed the human remains found by an officer were that of Varkha and that she had died from strangulation by a metal pole being placed across her throat.

Ginday denies the charge of murder by has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and also a further charge of perverting the course of justice by lying to police.

The trial continues.
