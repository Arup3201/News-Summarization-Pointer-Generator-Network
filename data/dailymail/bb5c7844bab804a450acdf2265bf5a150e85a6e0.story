The perks of visiting a food factory are obviously the free samples.  

In his latest public relations stunt, the North Korean dictator toured an army rations factory - but unfortunately for the despot, the pictures are less than flattering.

Pictured in his trademark black coat that strained across his ample stomach, Kim Jong-un was unfortunately unable to do up the lab coat worn on top.

During the visit, he inspected the factory's production control room, dissemination room and combined processing workshop to learn about how it is attempting to modernise. 

Only last month, it was rumoured he'd had his stomach stapled.

But if so, it doesn't appear to be working as he was pictured looking more bloated than ever as he toured the factory in Pyongyang.

The mystery over Kim Jong-un’s whereabouts for weeks in September led to claims suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China.

Following the leader's public re-emergence last month, the North Korean Ambassador in London, Hyon Hak Bong, told the BBC that there was ‘no doubt about it’ that Kim was healthy.

But his comments came as a source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent a few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain.

In September, it was claimed Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland. 

He has also been treated for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August. 

It has since been speculated that, as he continued to limp around, his weight added to the pressure on both legs, resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain.
