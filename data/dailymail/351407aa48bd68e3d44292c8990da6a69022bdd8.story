Fabio Borini is poised to join Queens Park Rangers after the west London club agreed a £10million deal with Liverpool for the striker.

The Italian had been linked with a move back to Sunderland after spending last season on loan at the Stadium of Light, but that deal has now completely collapsed due to the prohibitive cost of a permanent deal.

On the move: Fabio Borini is set to join Queens Park Rangers after a £10million fee was agreed for the striker

The 23-year-old Italian striker struggled to make the grade at Liverpool, although he was fans' favourite at Sunderland on loan last season.

This is shown by the fact he has just one league goal in 13 appearances for Liverpool.

He managed seven in 32 league matches for Sunderland during his loan spell and some were crucial in keeping the Black Cats up.

It was after a few of these goals that we saw his celebration, which sees him thrust his left hand to his teeth.

He explains: 'In Italy it means you've got the knife between your teeth - it's when you want to achieve something so badly that you are angry to reach your goals.'

Harry Redknapp also hopes to sign Sandro from Tottenham before the transfer window closes.

The Black Cats had wanted to take Borini on loan, but that option was ruled out once Sebastian Coates joined as Premier League rules don't allow clubs to sign more than one player on loan from the same team.

Redknapp was in the market for a new striker after Loic Remy joined Chelsea. 

Borini notched seven goals in a productive spell with Sunderland last season, leaving Gus Poyet keen to secure the 23-year-old's services on a repeat temporary deal.

Former Uruguay midfielder Poyet said after Sunderland's 1-0 loss at QPR on Saturday that he remained hopeful of securing a deal for Borini before Monday night's transfer deadline.

'I know how people feel but unfortunately we cannot give you all the information, all the true information on why he's not with us,' he said.

'I know from the outside it looks like it's him not wanting to come to Sunderland because of whatever, but I can promise you it's not like that.'

Value: Liverpool wanted a return on the £12m they spent on Borini, rather than letting him leave on loan
