The founder of file-sharing website Megaupload was today remanded in custody after denying charges of internet piracy and money laundering.

Kim Dotcom - nicknamed 'Dr Evil' - a German national, smiled and waved to around 20 supporters in court before being denied bail.

Prosecutor Anne Toohey argued at the bail 
hearing, in Auckland, New Zealand, that Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, 
was a flight risk 'at the extreme end of the scale' because it was 
believed he had access to funds, had multiple identities and had a 
history of fleeing criminal charges.     

But his defence lawyer said the former hacker, who is reportedly 6ft 6in tall and weighs more than 20 stone (285lbs), was hardly likely to escape detection by New Zealand immigration.

'He
 is not the sort of person who will pass unnoticed through our customs 
and immigration lines and controls,' said lawyer, Paul Davison.

Distinctive: Dotcom's defence lawyer argued that at 6ft 6in and weighing more than 20 stone (285lbs) the former hacker was unlikely to pass unnoticed through customs and immigration

He added that his client had cooperated fully, his passports had been seized and his funds
 frozen.

U.S. authorities want to extradite Dotcom, 38, in what they say is one of the biggest criminal copyright theft cases ever brought.

The convicted hacker is accused of masterminding a 
scheme that made more than $175million in a few short years by copying 
and distributing music, movies and other copyrighted content without 
authorisation.

Megaupload's lawyer has said the company simply offered 
online storage.

Support: Fans of Dotcom commiserated with each other after the German national was denied bail

Fans: Speaking to his supporters inside court Dotcom said: 'Hey guys thanks for turning up, I appreciate it.' He also wished a female supporter a 'happy birthday'

Defiant: Dotcom's defence lawyer, Paul Davison, said his client was 'realistic about what is happening' but was hopeful about the outcome of the judge's bail decision expected later this week

Judge David McNaughton said the bail 
application was too complicated for an immediate ruling, adding he would
 issue a written decision no later than Wednesday.         

Dotcom and three others, were arrested on Friday after New Zealand police raided his £16million  country estate at the request of the FBI.

Police
 had to cut Dotcom out of a safe room he had barricaded himself in, 
because, according to his layer, he was frightened and panicked.   

In total seven MegaUpload executives – including two other Germans and a 
Dutchman also seized in New Zealand – have each been charged with five counts 
of racketeering, copyright infringement and conspiracy, and could be 
jailed for up to 20 years.

Presenting Dotcom's case for flight 
risk, prosecutor Toohey said 45 credit cards in three wallets were found
 in the mansion under Dotcom's various names, while three passports were
 also found.

But his defence lawyer said: 'My client collects them (credit cards), most of them are out of date.'   

After the judge's decision Dotcom took time to talk to his supporters.

'Hey guys thanks for turning up, I appreciate it,' he said, wishing a female supporter a 'happy birthday'.             

Fleet: Police seized cars carried license plates that read 'MAFIA', 'HACKER', 'STONED', 'V', 'KIM COM', 'CEO' and 'POLICE'

High roller: A Rolls-Royce Phantom, worth £300,000 with the number plate 'GOD,' was also seized in Friday's swoop

Lavish: Dotcom also had a garish pink Cadillac in his collection of luxury cars,  which was also seized by police

Defence lawyer Davison said Dotcom was 'realistic about what is happening'.       

'He
 would obviously prefer to be at large. He doesn't want to be there any 
longer than he absolutely has to be,' he told reporters outside the 
court.     

Media 
reported that Dotcom ordered around NZ$4million ($3.2million, £2.7million) of 
renovations to the sprawling mansion that he leased near Auckland, with 
its manicured lawns, fountains, pools, palm-lined paths and extensive 
security.

New details have emerged about Dotcom's 
lavish lifestyle and tastes, with reports that he had a heated lap pool 
built just off the master ensuite, with underwater speakers, imported 
spring water and a custom ladder worth around NZ$15,000 ($15,700, £10,000).   

'It's insane, and it gets more insane
 inside. When we were there we called it "extreme home makeover, 
millionaire edition",' a source close to the teams that did renovation 
work told the New Zealand Herald. 

A film posted on the Internet shows 
Dotcom, surrounded by topless women and men spraying champagne on board a
 superyacht during a 'crazy weekend' in Monaco reported to have cost 
$10million.

Numbers: This graph shows how the shutdown of MegaUpload caused a noticeable drop in global internet traffic

Megaupload, based in Hong Kong, is considered a 
'cyberlocker', in which users can upload and transfer files that are too
 large to send by email. Such sites can have perfectly legitimate uses.

But the MPAA, which has campaigned for a crackdown on piracy, alleged that the vast majority of content being shared on MegaUpload was in violation of copyright laws.

The website allowed users to download films, TV shows, games, music and other content for free, but made money by charging subscriptions to people who wanted access to faster download speeds or extra content.

The website also sold advertising.

Although music stars such as Kanye West 
and Alicia Keys have supported MegaUpload, film and record companies say
 the seven-year-old file-sharing site is making a fortune off their work
 without paying them a penny.

According to the indictment, MegaUpload was estimated at one point to be the 13th most frequently visited website on the Internet.Current estimates by companies that monitor Web traffic place it in the top 100.

The five-count indictment, which alleges copyright infringement as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering and racketeering, described a site designed specifically to reward users who uploaded pirated content for sharing.For instance, users received cash bonuses if they uploaded content popular enough to generate massive numbers of downloads, according to the indictment. Such content was almost always copyright protected, the indictment said.

'Fast cars, hot girls, superyachts 
and amazing parties. Decadence rules,' said the commentary accompanying 
the so-called fun documentary, which Dotcom dedicated to 'all my 
fans'.      

The FBI estimates that Dotcom personally made around $115,000 ($121,000, £77,700) a day during 2010 from his empire.

The list of property to be seized, 
includes nearly 20 luxury cars, one of them a pink Cadillac, works of 
art, and NZ$10million ($10.5million, £6.7million) invested in local finance companies.      

Dotcom's New Zealand lawyer Davison said
 in court that Megaupload's business was being misrepresented and 
authorities were being aggressive to add drama to the 
case.               

'His business did not reproduce or copy material as alleged,' he told 
the court, adding that copyright holders had been given access to 
Megaupload to identify improper posting of material.

He likened the site
 to the popular YouTube video site, where people 'promoted their 
creativity'.  

Prosecutor Toohey said two other men sought on global warrants for involvement in Megaupload had been arrested in Europe.

In New Zealand, questions are being asked about how Dotcom, who moved to
 the country in 2010, could be given permanent residency under a 
business investor scheme despite criminal convictions for insider 
trading. 

The shockwaves of the case appeared to be spreading among rival websites
 offering lucrative file-sharing.

FileSonic, a website providing online 
data storage, said in a statement on its website that it had halted its 
file-sharing services.         

Dotcom's case is being heard as the debate over online piracy reaches fever pitch in Washington, where Congress is trying to craft tougher legislation.            

Lawmakers stopped anti-piracy legislation on Friday, postponing a critical vote in a victory for Internet companies that staged a mass online protest against the fast-moving bills.

The movie and music industries want Congress to crack down on Internet piracy and content theft, but major Internet companies such as Google and Facebook have complained that current drafts of the legislation would lead to censorship.             

Critics of the U.S. Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, and Protect IP Act (PIPA), quickly showed their opposition to the shutdown of Megaupload.com, with hackers attacking the public websites of the Justice Department, the world's largest music company Universal Music, and the two big trade groups that represent the music and film industries.
