She was violently stripped naked and beaten senseless by a mob of women on a busy shopping street ... but the police never came. 

Indeed, nobody intervened as Lin Yao Li, 38, was kicked in the groin and breasts as she writhed screaming in agony on the pavement. 

The reason, onlookers said, was that it was an 'argument of the heart' - she didn't deserve help because had slept with another woman's husband.

It is only the latest in a number of similar incidents in which it seems there is placid acceptance in Chinese society of such humiliation, as long as the victim is seen as deserving in having caused a man to cheat on his partner.
