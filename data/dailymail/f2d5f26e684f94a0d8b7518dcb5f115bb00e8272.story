Nearly two years after elderly couple were murdered execution style inside their palatial home, Massachusetts authorities are renewing their appeal to the public for help in finding the culprit.

Real estate developer John ‘Jack’ Magee, 69, and his 67-year-old wife, Geraldine ‘Jeri’ Magee, were found murdered in their Andover home by their daughter December 14, 2011.

The couple’s Lexus SUV was found torched the previous night in Boston, about 20 miles away.

On Tuesday, as the two-year anniversary of the couple’s death approaches, Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett and Andover Police Chief Patrick Keefe said they are still actively investigating the killings.

They urged anyone with possible information to contact Massachusetts state police detectives assigned to Blodgett’s office.

Jeff Greene, Mrs Magee's nephew, told The Eagle Tribune that the family are still searching for answers and are desperate for closure.

He added that detectives working the case have been giving the relatives regular updates on the investigation, but so far there have been no suspects or new leads.

'The investigation remains active and a high priority,' Blodgett said in a statement. 'We will continue to pursue every lead until we find the person or persons responsible for this tragic murder and seek justice for the Magee family in court.'

Friends of the Magees said after the double homicide that the couple had no enemies and lived a 'charmed life' in Andover - an area known for organized crime.

Their daughter, Holly Magee Senykoff, 
was leaving her two children to be watched by her parents as she did 
every week when she found their bodies at 9.30am December 14, 2011.

John and Geraldine had been shot in the neck, their bodies positioned head-to-head and all shell casings removed from the scene off the crime, suggesting that it may have been a mob execution.

Authorities are remaining tight-lipped about the circumstances of 
the slayings and provided no public updates on the progress of the 
investigation.

Though they did not identify any 
suspects or established any motive, police reassured residents it was an isolated killing.

John and Geraldine Magee met as 
teenagers at Arlington High School and went on to have a long and happy 
marriage spanning four decades and resulting in two children, daughter Holly and son John Magee III, who has continued his father's thriving construction business.

Their sprawling 5,500-square-foot home at 7 Orchard Crossing, which they built themselves, was put up for sale in June of this year for $1.25million. The price has since dropped to $999,999.
