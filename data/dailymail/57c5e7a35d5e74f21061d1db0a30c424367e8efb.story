An artist made a papier-mâché sculpture from comics only to discover that the books were in fact first editions worth about £20,000. 

The piece of artwork, called Paperboy, was created by Andrew Vickers, 49, from Sheffield, who found the comics for the man-sized statue in a skip.

However, after handing the sculpture over to an exhibition he was told the comics, which included a first edition of The Avengers, would have been worth a small fortune.  

Oops: Andrew Vickers pictured with his sculpture called Paperboy which he created using £20,000 of comics

Comic book expert, Steve Eyre, 52, made the jaw-dropping discovery when he looked at the piece and it began to dawn on him that the pages pasted to the leg of Paperboy were from the classic comic book published by Marvel Comics. 

Mr Eyre, who also has a first edition of The Avengers which is worth around £10,000, said it would have been cheaper for the jobbing artist to have sculpted it out of Italian marble.

He said: 'As I walked round it, on the inside right leg, there was a cover of The Avengers number one.

'I actually did a double take when I saw it.

'I’ve got a copy of that, which was published in 1963, and it is worth well over £10,000. 

'Then I started looking and there are six other comics on the sculpture that added with the number one would be worth £20,000.'

Mr Vickers explained how he came across the valuable books. He said: 'I saw the box in a skip and thought you can’t throw those away.

'If somebody chucks things out in the skip they don’t generally throw things out that are worth anything.

'I didn’t know what I was going to do with them. I just thought they were lovely things.

'I had them for ages until I heard about the exhibition and decided to make a sculpture.

Steve Eyre said it would have been cheaper for Andrew Vickers to make the sculpture out of Italian marble

'Steve said 'wow this is good' and then started walking around saying 'where did you get this one from, where did you get that one from?

'He couldn’t believe it but I think there is no point crying over spilt milk.'

Mr Eyre said he couldn’t sleep that night after realising how much the comic books were worth.

'Nothing can be done now but I’m looking to get Jonathan Ross to buy the sculpture, or maybe Nicolas Cage, they both like comics.

'In the end I’ll probably never sell it but it’ll be a great talking point.'

Mr Eyre, who runs Sheffield-based comic business World of Superheroes, added: 'I lost sleep thinking about the sculpture and he built it up from lots of different layers so I dread to think what is underneath.

'It would have been cheaper for Andrew to make this out of Italian marble because the raw materials that have gone in to it, I could have sold for a lot more than he is going to sell this statue for.

'In the end, it is a beautiful thing but Andrew is a talented jobbing artist who hasn’t had his break yet and £20,000 is a lot of money to him.

'I told him later I had loads of comics I could have given him for 10p if he needed them and to call me first if he finds anything else in a skip.'
