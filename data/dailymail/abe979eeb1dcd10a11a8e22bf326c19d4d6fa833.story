A tattooed model who became an internet sensation after posting a video of herself jiggling her boobs to Mozart on the internet has released a festive version of her party trick - moving her breasts to the tune of Jingle Bells. 

The original clip, which showed Sara X Mills moving her boobs individually and simultaneously to the sound of Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik was viewed more than 26 million times in just one week. 

But Sara's popularity was a double-edged sword - although the short film gave her instant fame and helped to raise money for charity, it also brought death threats.

Sara X first became an internet star by jiggling her breasts to Mozart. She has since filmed another clip just in time for Christmas where she moves her chest in time to Jingle Bells 

Sara X, a former stripper and freelance writer, says that she was 'bored and uninspired' at the time she recorded the video.

But the 27-year-old revealed that she received a barrage of abuse from internet trolls after the clip went global in October. 

She told Jezebel at the time: 'I know I've definitely been called a w**** and a s*** and an attention w**** far more times than I ever was when I was actually in an adult industry. 

'Mostly the people who have negative things to say about my character, or my presumed profession, past profession, and life decisions don't get that the video is meant to be humorous, and operate under the assumption that I just wanted to show the world my boobs.'

Sara said that she had found the attention her trick had brought disconcerting and that she wouldn't feel too sad when her time int he spotlight passed.

However, she must have had a change of heart since making those statements as she uploaded the fresh clip to YouTubeyesterday. 

She first appears in the video dressed in a faux fut coat, but soon strips off the item of clothing to reveal a candy cane striped bikini top. 

Sara then twerks her breasts to the rhythm of Jingle Bells. 

Since uploading the clip yesterday, Sara's new video has already had more than one million views

Since uploading the clip yesterday, the video has already had more than one million views, but the response to her new effort has been mixed.  

One user called Not Too Shabby write: 'The moment you realize that you have less subscribers than a girl who jiggles her boobs to music..... awkward.' 

While another called Toxiccomando said: 'The thing I love most about this is while Sara is indeed very sexy the video itself isn't. 

'The faces she makes, makes the video at least to me very funny.'

Many used the comments section to voice their dislike of women with tattoos though, including Jeff Allen, who wrote: 'Not a fan of so many tattoos on women, especially on their breasts. Sorry... just how I feel.' 

There was also a second video uploaded called the B-Roll, where Sara jumps around jiggling her boobs and bottom. 

According to the model, she was asked by the producers to: 'Just... do some stuff to make the bells jingle. It will be fun.'
