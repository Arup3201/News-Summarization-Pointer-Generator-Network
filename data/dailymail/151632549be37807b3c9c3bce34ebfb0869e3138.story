Russian tourist Sergey Bogdanov has said he was badly beaten after he rang a sacred bell while on holiday in an Indian village

Mr Bogdanov, from the Russian seaport city of Kaliningrad, said he was badly beaten by a mob after ringing the bell and was even refused help by doctors.

He told Russian media by telephone: 'It seemed really peaceful here and the locals are friendly, all that changed when I went to a local temple to take a few pictures and I saw a bell which I rang.

'Apparently the bell is only rung on sacred days when somebody dies, and before I knew it there was a mob rushing up to the temple and I was dragged out onto the streets and kicked and beaten with sticks.

'Some monks dragged me away from the mob but they then didn't help me at all, and I had to make my own way to the local medical centre where the doctors had heard about my apparently sacrilegious act â€“ and they also refused to help me other than giving me a few bandages.

'My wallet and my money had vanished and I had no alternative but to go back to my accommodation in agony. I managed to get a telephone message to my mother who flew over immediately but I need paperwork and money to fly back with her.

'My poor mother almost had a heart attack when she saw me, she is doing her best to look after me but I need proper medical attention that I can only get it seems in Russia.'

Mr Bogdanov has appealed to Putin to help him get the paperwork and a ticket back home via the Russian Embassy in Mumbai.
