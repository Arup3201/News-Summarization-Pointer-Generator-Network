The morning after Nelson Mandela’s death, in the windswept gloom, one man made a solitary journey to the former maximum security prison on Robben Island. There, in what has become a monument to the anti-apartheid struggle, he said a silent prayer.

Christo Brand, a white prison warder who locked up Mandela and his political comrades nightly for four years, enjoyed an unlikely friendship with the man who went on to become South Africa’s President. They remained close until the end.

Their unique friendship was sealed on the stormy day that, 33 years ago, Mandela’s wife Winnie arrived on Robben Island with their baby granddaughter Zoleka.

Eternal bond: Christo Brand was a prison guard at Robben Island during Mandela's time in incarceration and risked his job to ensure he met his baby granddaughter in 1980

Now for the first time, Christo 
reveals the extraordinary story of how he smuggled the baby past his 
fellow guards in an act of mercy unprecedented in Mandela’s 18 years on 
Robben Island.

One of the 
cruellest rules there  was that prisoners should never  touch or see a 
child, not even one from the warders’ families – something that was 
particularly hard for African prisoners from traditional extended 
families.

It is well-recorded that Mandela felt crippled by the lack of communication with children.

In
 1980, during the harshest regime on the island, he received a visit 
from  Winnie. She was a ‘banned’ person under the Apartheid government, 
forced to live in a township on the outskirts of Pretoria, a day’s drive
 from Cape Town and its prison island.

On
 a rainy day, she made her way to the ferry to see her husband for the 
30-minute visit that they were allowed just once every three months.

Special visit: Zoleka Mandela, pictured in 2011, was only four months old when she was sneaked past security by Christo Brand to see her great grandfather

White people went inside the 
weatherproof cabin. Winnie and the other black visitors were directed to
 the top deck, exposed to the wind and rain. She took her place 
uncomplaining, wrapping herself in a blanket.

When
 she arrived on the island it was discovered she had smuggled a baby 
with her – the four-month-old granddaughter Nelson Mandela had never 
seen.

Christo remembers it 
well. ‘Of course, we could not allow her to take the baby in to see her 
husband,’ he says. ‘She had to leave the child in someone’s care in the 
waiting room. She pleaded with me to allow Mandela to see her but I had 
to refuse.

‘As usual they 
sat either side of  the glass screen, their hands touching on the glass.
 I stood behind Mandela. He said, “Please Mr Brand, let me at least see 
the baby as my wife carries her away after the visit”.

‘I
 spoke to the warrant officer, my superior. We both knew it was 
impossible. But at the end of 30 minutes I told Mandela to wait. I went 
into the waiting room and told Winnie I’d like to hold the baby.

‘I told her I had never held a black baby. She let me have her and I walked back to Mandela behind the security screen.

'I called Mandela and put the baby in his arms, unexpectedly. I told him he must keep quiet about it or we could lose our jobs.

'He just said: “Oh” and held the 
child, and kissed her and there were tears in his eyes. I had to take 
the baby and give her back to Winnie and not even tell her what had 
happened.

‘Nobody could 
know that Mandela had ever seen the child. He kept it a secret from 
everybody and so I was very pleased he did that.’

Isolation: Nelson Mandela in his confinement cell on Robben Island where he had been incarcerated for 27 years for his views in opposition of the apartheid regime

It seems Mandela never forgot that 
kindness. Many years later after his release, in the midst of the 
worldwide fanfare of publicity, he called Christo and invited him to 
Parliament.

He offered him a
 job in the Constitutional Assembly, entertained Christo and his wife to
 tea at his  presidential residence, and invited the former warder to 
his birthday celebrations for the rest of his life.

Christo
 was just 19, a raw prison service recruit, when he was sent to the 
island to join the security team guarding South Africa’s most demonised 
freedom fighters.

He was 
warned that they were a band of dangerously ruthless men dedicated to 
overthrowing the government. Their leader was a powerful, thoughtful 
Xhosa tribesman who immediately astounded Christo with his politeness 
and humility.

‘He was 60 
years old, I was just a boy from the farm,’ says Christo. ‘I saw the 
sometimes brutal way other guards treated the maximum security 
prisoners. I saw the way that Mandela responded.

‘He would kneel down, uncomplaining, to sweep up the dust and dirt  outside his cell when there was going to be an inspection.

‘He had a quietness and a mental 
discipline I’d never seen before. I was a teenager and he called me  “Mr
 Brand” with what seemed like real respect.

‘I was prepared to hate this man trying to bring us all down and ruin our country. Instead I was won over by him very quickly.

‘I
 saw his suffering and near-desperation when we censored every word 
going to him or coming from him, and recorded every conversation he 
held.

‘I used to stand 
behind him during the few visits he was allowed and I could see the 
anguish in him when his beloved wife Winnie was there, on the other side
 of a glass screen. I read all his letters to her and her replies to 
him.

Desperate attempt: Winnie Mandela broke the rules when she attempted to smuggle in the baby, and she never knew that the Mr Brand had brought the baby to Madiba

‘He was the clear leader of all the political prisoners and he never stopped trying to get their messages out to the rest of the world. But he also missed his wife and children, and their family life.’

Christo began to realise that Mandela’s humanity was psychologically reversing their roles. Impressed with the unwavering regime that Mandela imposed on himself – the morning exercise; the tending of a vegetable patch he nurtured outside his cell; the reading and studying when he was allowed an electric light; the interminable passing of notes to his comrades through ever-more ingenious means – Christo found himself continually on the receiving end of overwhelming sympathy from the older man. 

‘You had to respect him, the dignified way he accepted the rules and regulations, the way he never asked for any favours or showed anything but respect for me and my job,’ Christo says. ‘Soon he was giving me advice and telling me I should study and achieve a better education and career. He seemed to want the best for me.

‘Once, when he had been moved to 
Pollsmoor Prison on the mainland,  I came into his cell and saw a small 
container had been lowered into it through the slated windows. Other 
prisoners were communicating with him in this way.

‘He
 looked at me and said, “You need to report this.” He knew that  I 
couldn’t bend the rules without  losing my job. New secure windows were 
fixed and they had to find another way to communicate.

‘I
 was often wired for sound when I entered his cell. When he offered to 
make me coffee or started to chat, which was not allowed, I would make a
 gesture to show we were being recorded.

‘We had a bond that way. I  wanted to help him, I liked him and believed in him, and for his part he wanted to help me.’

Christo was relieved for Mandela that he had died peacefully at  home. ‘His home and family meant everything to him,’ he says.

Family ties: Zoleka is the daughter of Nelson Mandela's youngest child Zindzi, portrayed with him 2011

‘We talked a lot about those values, but I’ve watched him fading over the years. Now I’ll never hear  his voice again or see that bright  smile. Last time we met he teased me about my weight and said I should do more exercise.’

They also shared bleaker moments. Like Mandela, Christo suffered the loss of a son who died in a car  accident. ‘He was the first to call me and try to comfort me,’ he says. ‘Mandela always had time to show he cared, he was always concerned about family matters even when he had the great weight of State affairs to deal with.’

He says that Mandela would have enjoyed the scenes of dancing and singing in the streets that followed his death on Thursday evening.

‘I wish I could have seen all the love coming to him from all over the world.’ Christo has written his own life story around his relationship with Mandela, with the old man’s blessing and encouragement. Mandela – My Prisoner, My Friend, will be published next March.

For the two of them it was the  natural continuation of a solid friendship, built in the grim surroundings of a maximum security prison and lasting well into the final years of Mandela’s long life.

The black freedom fighter prepared to die to liberate his people from a cruel regime, and the  Afrikaans farm boy born into that same regime.

‘Through him I saw many human moments,’ Christo says. ‘That was our relationship, a series of small human moments that I now treasure more than ever.’

Today he still takes the ferry daily to Robben Island where he supervises supplies to the tourist shops and runs the busy cafeteria.

Last Friday he described how the island felt empty now Mandela had gone. ‘I’ve always felt he was still here in spirit,’ he says.

‘I could still hear his voice sometimes and remembered all those painful times we shared when he was fighting for freedom and we were there to deprive him of it.

‘Now we’ll never see him here  ever again.’
