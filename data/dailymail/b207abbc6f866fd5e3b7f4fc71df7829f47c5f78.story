Lindsey, who is currently caring for two rescued Babydoll sheep and has previously nurtured a lamb in high school, said that she has always been an animal lover

In 2013, Lindsey and her husband Phil adopted Libby five years after the birth of their son Noah. By sharing the pictures of the duo, Lindsey hopes that it will lift someone's spirits

Lindsey, who is currently caring for two rescued Babydoll sheep and has previously nurtured a lamb in high school, said that she has always been an animal lover, according to the Huffington Post.

'Libby has been obsessed with pigs for about six months now, always wanting to see pictures of them and watch videos on our phones,' said Lindsey. 'So, after lots of research and hearing wonderful things about these sweet guys, we decided that adding a pig to our family would be great.'

Lindsey and her husband Phil adopted Libby in 2013, five years after the birth of their son Noah. By sharing the pictures of the duo, Lindsey hopes that it will lift someone's spirits.

The mother said since they added Pearl to the family, Libby and the pig have been inseparable (above Libby and Pearl playing with her birthday toys)

Libby has always been obsessed with pigs and before she got Pearl, would ask to see pictures and videos of the animal on her parents' phones

The pig is not the only animal that are housed at the Bonnices. They also have two cats, three dogs, a tortoise and a rabbit

The mother said since they added Pearl to the family, Libby and the pig have been inseparable, according to WRIC.

'Libby is just obsessed with Pearl and it is quite funny,' said Lindsey. 'When I have Pearl in her playpen, Libby will sit next to it and yell, 'Pearl, Pearl,' and they'll kind of nuzzle noses. 

'She also shows Pearl her toys and tries to pick her up.'

The Bonnice's household is already filled with other animals in addition to the two sheep which include two cats, three dogs, a tortoise and a rabbit, according to Popsugar.

The pig will be raised as a family pet similar to a dog according to the Bonnices.

Phil and Lindsey thought it would be a good idea to to add a pig to the family and it has been a match made in heaven ever since

Pearl was given to Libby as an early birthday present last month (above the two are in the birthday mood as they pose for Libby's birthday)

Lindsey said the two do everything together including sharing snuggles in the morning and giving kisses after bath time. She said they also like to nuzzle their noses together
