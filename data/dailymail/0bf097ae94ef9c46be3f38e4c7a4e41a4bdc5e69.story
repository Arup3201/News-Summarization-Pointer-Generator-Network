Chelsea held their sport at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Leicester while Arsenal came from two goals down to draw against Everton.

Formation: 3-5-2 

GK: Kasper Schmeichel, Leicester City (vs Chelsea), 8.5 

Rob Draper at Stamford Bridge

Kasper Schmeichel did his level-best to try and keep out a relentless second half onslaught from Chelsea. The Danish stopper made several brilliant saves from Branislav Ivanovic before finally being beaten by Diego Costa.

RB: Seamus Coleman, Everton (vs Arsenal), 7

Adam Crafton at Goodison Park 

Few defensive lapses but relentless going forward and a belting header to open the scoring.

CB: Branislav Ivanovic, Chelsea (vs Leicester City), 7

Rob Draper at Stamford Bridge

Arguably Chelsea's driving force down the right-hand side against the Foxes on Saturday. The Serbian defender forced Schmeichel into to athletic saves before setting up Costa to break the deadlock.

CB: James Tomkins, West Ham (vs Crystal Palace) 7

Neil Ashton at Selhurst Park

Solid display at the back for West Ham as they put Crystal Palace to the sword. 

RM: Nathan Dyer, Swansea City (vs Burnley), 7.5

Riath Al-Samarrai at the Liberty Stadium

Took his chance after Ben Mee made a hash of an interception and Michael Duff hesitated in closing Nathan Dyer down. Lively performance on his 100th Premier League appearance to help his team pick up another three points.

CM: James McCarthy, Everton (vs Arsenal), 7.5

Adam Crafton at Goodison Park 

Athletic, dogged and influential in the midfield, setting a breathless tempo for his team..

CM: Oscar, Chelsea (vs Leicester City), 7

Rob Draper at Stamford Bridge

At the heart of all-things-good for Chelsea on Saturday afternoon. Tireless in his running and set up the move for Costa's opening goal after a sumptuous pass to Ivanovic with the outside of his right boot.

CM: Dean Hammond, Leicester (vs Chelsea), 8

Rob Draper at Stamford Bridge 

Dean Hammond was the most dominant presence in the midfield during an impressive first 45 minutes for Leicester at Stamford Bridge. He was unlucky not to be celebrating an assist after he played in David Nugent, who forced Thibaut Courtois into a fine save with his right leg on 52 minutes.

RM: Jeff Schlupp, Leicester (vs Chelsea), 7 

Rob Draper at Stamford Bridge 

Caused the Chelsea backline a lot of problems during the first half as he managed to find pockets of space in threatening areas. Skipped past Cesc Fabregas during one of Leicester's best moves and his pace was a constant worry for the Blues.

General: James McCarthy (right) put in a tireless performance during Everton's 2-2 draw against Arsenal

CF: Diego Costa, Chelsea (vs Leicester), 7

Rob Draper at Stamford Bridge

Controlled a difficult cross on his chest before hammering Chelsea ahead to score on his Stamford Bridge debut. Pace, power and a never-say-die attitude will make Costa a fan favourite in no time. 

CF: Mauro Zarate, West Ham (vs Crystal Palace), 7

Neil Ashton at Selhurst Park

Scored his first West Ham goal with a stunning left-foot volley to put his side ahead in the 34th minute. Lucky not to be shown a red card, however, after a dangerous tackle on Stuart O'Keefe.   

In the groove: Diego Costa (above) scored Chelsea's opening goal at Stamford Bridge
