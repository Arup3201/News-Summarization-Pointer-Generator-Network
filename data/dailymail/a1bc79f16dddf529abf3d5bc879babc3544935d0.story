[headerlinks]The National Football League Draft continued on Friday as rounds two and three were completed, though the second day was largely overshadowed by the surprise on Thursday that star quarterback Johnny Manziel was selected as the 22nd pick overall by the Cleveland Browns.

The Houston Texans had the first pick of the second round and selected UCLA guard Xavier Su'a-Filo, who joins the first overall pick, defensive disrupter Jadeveon Clowney of South Carolina. The two of them can have fun colliding against each other in minicamps and training camp. The 6-foot-4, 307-pound Su'a-Filo, who went on a Mormon mission while in college, also has played tackle.

The Dallas Cowboys, with the second pick of the round, took Boise State defensive end Demarcus Lawrence, who they hope will emulate their departed sacks leader with the same first name, DeMarcus Ware, now with Denver. 'I'm my own Demarcus,' Lawrence said. 'I don't like to try to be nobody else. I'm going to be me, and I'm going to do it well.'

With the third pick, the Browns added a protector for Johnny Manziel by grabbing guard Joel Bitonio of Nevada, who also can play tackle or center. The Browns caused the biggest stir on opening night when they traded up to No. 22 to get Johnny Football.

It took 54 selections, a draft record, for a running back to go. Bishop Sankey of Washington was chosen by the Tennessee Titans, who cut Chris Johnson this spring. Two more went in the next three selections: Jeremy Hill of LSU to Cincinnati, and Carlos Hyde of Ohio State to San Francisco. Heisman Trophy finalist Tre Mason went 75th overall to St. Louis.

A total of 39 early entrants have been selected so far, 25 on Friday. Altogether, there were a record 102 early entrants this year. College powerhouses Oklahoma, Texas and Georgia did not have anyone chosen in the first three rounds.

Other high-profile players that have attractive girlfriends have yet to be drafted.

University of Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron, who got engaged to model and former Miss Alabama Katherine Webb in March, is still awaiting selection. And University of Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray, who is dating Philadelphia TV news reporter Kacie McDonnell, has also yet to be chosen.
