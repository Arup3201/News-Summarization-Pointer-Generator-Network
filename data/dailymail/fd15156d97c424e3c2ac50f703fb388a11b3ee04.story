Living out of a suitcase is part of going on holiday, but very few travellers can say they have actually stayed in one.

For just 15 Euros per night, visitors to Lunzenau, Germany, can enjoy the novelty of staying in the world's smallest hotel, which is literally a piece of luggage.

The Suitcase Hotel is set in an oversized suitcase measuring a minuscule 9ft by 4ft 10in.

Living out of a suitcase: Sabrina Trommer and Stephan Lehmann outside the world's smallest hotel in Luzenau, Germany. It is literally a a 9ft by 5ft piece of luggage which you can enjoy for just 15 euros per night

Perfect for those who don't like to unpack: The tiny hotel sleeps just two, in unfortunate proximity to the toilet...

Built in 2004, the hotel includes a mini bathroom with a toilet and sink as well as bunk beds. It can cater to only two guests.

The man behind The Suitcase Hotel is retired railway conductor Matthias Letterman.

'I wanted to make a crazy and unusual stopover that fitted in with the Railway themed museum and restaurant we had established nearby back in 1998,' said the 56-year-old.

'One of the large suitcases being displayed at the museum was offered to me. With the help of two friends - a plumber and a roofer - I managed to turn it into a hotel.'

More than 3000 people from across the world have stayed at The Suitcase Hotel over the past decade.

Something to remember us by: Miss Trommer writes on the door which is used as the guest book

Mr Letterman, who is from Lunzenau, said: 'We packed as many facilities as we could into the luggage space and ended up with no room for a guest book.

'So instead, we ask guests to write comments or draw pictures about their stay on the walls of The Suitcase Hotel.

'Judging by the remarks on the walls, everyone loves staying here. The small space doesn't put anyone off.'
