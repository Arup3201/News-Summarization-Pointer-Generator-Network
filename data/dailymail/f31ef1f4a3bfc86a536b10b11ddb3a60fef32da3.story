A teenage boy suffered 'horrendous' injuries that could leave him blind after acid was thrown into his face as he was enjoying a walk in woodland.

It is feared the 16-year-old could be permanently disfigured after suffering severe burns to his face, including his eyes, and upper body.

The unnamed boy is being treated at a specialist hospital in London with his parents at his bedside.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said 
it was 'too early for prognosis' and that they are still investigating what 
the acid was and what container it had been in.

Two men have been arrested by detectives investigating the chemical attack, which happened in darkness as the boy walked near woods in his hometown of Yateley, near Farnborough, Hampshire.

The 46-year-old man from Yateley and a
33-year-old man from Farnborough have been released on bail pending further 
inquiries.

Police denied the attack was a drug deal gone wrong or over a financial matter or girl. They confirmed the young victim was white and British.

Paramedics were called to the scene and gave the boy immediate treatment for the facial injuries before he was rushed to hospital.

The teenager, who has not been named by police, was left writhing in agony on the pathway as the acid burnt through his clothes and skin.

The attackers, who were wearing dark clothes, ran off before emergency services arrived.

A spokesman for Hampshire Police said that the attacker was a stranger to the teenager, but added it was not a random incident.

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Darren Barrett, who is the senior investigating officer, said: 'This was a terrifying attack which has left the victim with horrendous injuries.

'He is currently receiving specialist treatment in hospital and his family are at his bedside.

'This is not believed to have been a random attack.'

He added: 'I would appeal to the local community to think hard about anything they might know or have heard about this incident and to contact my team with any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem.

'I am aware that there has been lots of information being exchanged over social media sites and would be keen to hear from anyone who has seen or received such information.

'My team has been working extremely hard to investigate this incident and following up a number of lines of enquiry since it happened.

'Extra officers will be in the area this evening conducting house-to-house enquiries as part of an anniversary operation - a week to the day since the incident happened.'
