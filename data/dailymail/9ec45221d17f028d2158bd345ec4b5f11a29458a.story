When Tony Pulis was out of work 12 months ago he travelled to the Crimean battlefields to indulge his love of history and took time to travel to America to see his new baby grandson.

This time it will be different. Three days after leaving Crystal Palace all the 56-year-old wants is to return to management as soon as possible.

He's proved that he has more variety in his coaching repertoire than the long throws for which his Stoke team were once notorious - and he wants to find another home to use his unique ability to build and develop a football club.

Quick resolution: Former Palace boss Tony Pulis wants to get back in management as soon as possible 

Pulis, named Premier League Manager of the Year by the LMA just three short months ago, is fiercely proud not only of how he saved Palace from an instant return to the Championship but of how he did it.

He has asked the LMA to help him tie up the legal niceties of his exit from Selhurst Park as quickly as possible to allow him to move on.

On Saturday night, a friend said: 'Tony is old school and loves football and wants to work again as soon as possible.

'After seven years at Stoke he was possibly ready for a break – this time he's hungry to remain in the game because he really enjoyed what he achieved at Palace and is disappointed he hasn't been able to kick on.'

Pulis saw the fields where the Charge of the Light Brigade took place and made sure that he didn't lead Palace into impossible positions.

But he walked out of Selhurst Park on Thursday feeling his job had become untenable as his relationship with chairman Steve Parish broke down.

The two clashed over transfer policy and budgets, with Palace having spent just £2.5million so far this summer despite collecting more than £60million in TV income by staying in the top flight.

He took over last November a club that had just four points, and not only finished 11th but did it by evolving an exciting style of play that made a nonsense of the long ball reputation that was a hangover from his early Stoke days.

Palace fans who were initially reluctant about his appointment loved the free flowing use of wingers and wanted more, except from better players and a stronger squad.

The friend said: 'The idea which is being put around that the chairman didn't want to back Tony in the transfer market because he didn't like the style of play is frankly mystifying.

'When he took over he had to work with the squad he inherited and he organised them to play with pace and power and be really quick through the pitch.

'The result was some fantastically exciting games and some brilliant nights at Selhurst Park that got the ground absolutely buzzing.

'Nobody was complaining about the style of play when Palace beat Chelsea near the end of the season, or won 3-2 at Everton, or drew 3-3 with Liverpool.

'People were saying that was one of the most exciting games seen at Selhurst Park in years.'

Pulis had planned to kick Palace forward during the summer, and believed he had convinced England centre half Steven Caulker to sign, only to find the club couldn't agree a deal.

He wanted to strengthen the squad with other top players, but increasingly clashed with Parish and director of football Iain Moody about recruitment.

Behind the scenes he has started work on plans to improve the club's training and medical facilities, just as he did at Stoke during seven years that dragged the club into the 21st Century.

But he believed that after working miracles to not just stay up but finish in 11th place – securing an extra £8million in merit money from the Premier League's TV rights distribution fund – he had earned the right to have a bigger say in where the club went next.

Palace finished the season in a rich vein of form losing only one of their last eight games and scoring 14 goals in the process.

And Pulis planned to serve up more entertainment while targeting a top half Premier League finish for the first time in the club's history.

Instead he ended up unwilling to risk his proud record of never getting relegated in 22 years and 920 games as a manager if he didn't have the final say on the make-up of his squad.

Pulis left Selhurst Park on Thursday feeling his job had become untenable as his relationship with chairman Steve Parish broke down over transfer policy and budgets.

He took over last November when Palace had just four points and guided them to an 11th-placed finish playing exciting football that made a mockery of the long-ball reputation he earned from his early Stoke days.

The friend added: 'The idea which is being put around that the chairman didn't want to back Tony in the transfer market because he didn't like the style of play is frankly mystifying.

'When he took over he had to work with the squad he inherited and he organised them to play with pace and power and be really quick through the pitch.

'The result was some fantastically exciting games and some brilliant nights at Selhurst Park that got the ground absolutely buzzing.'
