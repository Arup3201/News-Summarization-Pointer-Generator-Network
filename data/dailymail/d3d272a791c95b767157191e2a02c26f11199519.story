A 24-year-old aspiring actress has been filmed being catcalled 108 times as she strolled around New York City - even though she was wearing  a plain T-shirt, jeans and sneakers.  

Shoshana Roberts, a graduate of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, was captured on a hidden camera by her friend, Rob Bliss, as she walked through the city's streets.

Over a ten-hour period, she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'Smile' and 'Have a nice evening darling'.

She was even followed by some men for several minutes, with one repeatedly asking her: 'You don't wanna talk? Because I'm ugly?' Others winked at her, whistled and made inappropriate noises.

The shocking video, filmed in August, was later posted on YouTube and Facebook by Miss Roberts, who describes herself as 'a New York City-based actress with a black belt'.

Alongside the clip, Miss Roberts wrote: 'This happens daily to so many people. We don't put up with harassment in school, at home, or at work, so why should we have to put up with it on the street?'

She added: 'Everyone has a right to feel safe.'

Mr Bliss, who captured the footage via a camera hidden in his backpack, said he was inspired to film Miss Roberts after his girlfriend, Kendal Pektas, complained of being catcalled by men.

The unwanted come-ons were picked up by two microphones that Miss Roberts was holding in her hand. The pair did not even realise some of the catcalls had occurred until they  viewed the footage. 

'I was very shocked by the audio devices picking up comments when I was halfway down the block,' Miss Roberts told the New York Daily News.

'I didn't even know that they were occurring, which means there are other times people say things I'm not aware of.'

Writing on Facebook, Mr Bliss explained: 'It's not just one comment, it's a collective weight.

'Imagine those same guys saying all those same comments to you as you're going about your day, and imagine how you'd feel.

'You may think saying something is innocent, but your missing the forest for the trees.
