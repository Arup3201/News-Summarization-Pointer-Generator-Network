After missing the win over England, the world’s leading fly-half Dan Carter is expected to return to the All Black controls against Scotland at BT Murrayfield this weekend.

The New Zealand camp were tight-lipped on their team, to be announced on Thursday but, while some leading names are expected to be rested, the man who took over the ‘No 1-No 10’ tag from Jonny Wilkinson is in line to continue his recovery from a leg fracture.

Having made it clear that he would not divulge the team early, backs coach Ian Foster was then asked how he would like Carter to play against Scotland.

Smiling, he replied: ‘I guess you are asking me what I want our 10 (stand-off) to do on Saturday … regardless of who plays.

‘I think we’ve stated before that we are keen for Dan to get significant game time on this tour so, whether he’s starting or off the bench he’s likely to be there in some form, but for him he’s got to just carry on doing what he’s doing.

‘He took some good steps in Chicago and I think he got a lot of confidence out of getting back on the park and getting used to the systems. It [the Scotland game] is clearly going to be a pretty significant step-up from that so it’s just getting timing, getting used to the speed of the defence coming at you and still getting your focus to give yourself a chance to make the right decisions. Those are the little things that just come from time in the saddle.

‘It’s not easy – it doesn’t matter how many Tests you have played – to come back in after a break and perform, and so I guess both Dan and Sonny Bill Williams have been asking lots of questions.

‘But mainly it is just getting them feeling the way the team is flowing and getting their involvement in that. I think we’ve been able to speed up the process, largely because of their attitude and their desire to get it right.’

Foster, whose playing career spanned the amateur and pro eras at Waikato and the Chiefs, leads on the All Blacks attack and he admitted that he was impressed with what he saw from Scotland in their five-try, 41-31 win over Argentina on Saturday - especially the way in which the core of Glasgow players had carried their club form into the Test arena.

‘I think they certainly showed the benefits of that combination,’ he said of the virtually all-Warriors back line. ‘It doesn’t always work out like that when you transition from club to internationals, so clearly they’ve done a good job in how they prepared their group last week and they’ll be pleased with the result.

‘They showed a desire to play and are obviously feeling pretty good about that, so I guess what it has done is raised the bar a little bit with us about the challenges which will come on Saturday.’

While Foster is acutely aware of the skills at his disposal Ben Smith, one of his most astute and versatile backs, is still to catch up on Scotland’s game against the Pumas. Still, the Otago utility man is excited about the Scots’ style of rugby.

‘I think it’s good that they’re wanting to play expansively, and move the ball when they can,’ he said. ‘That’s the good thing about rugby, I think, that that kind of play gets rewarded, so it’s good to see that Scotland have embraced that kind of rugby and I’m sure it will make for good entertainment on Saturday.

‘There are some quality players throughout their back line. [Stuart] Hogg the full-back is a very dangerous runner and the likes of [Sean] Maitland and their back three are pretty dangerous, so they’re not unknown at all. The guys have a good amount of respect for this Scotland team and we know we’ll have to be on our game this weekend.’

Pushed on whether complacency might creep in when facing a team they have never lost to, Smith added: ‘We’re not complacent at all - we have a big challenge ahead of us.

‘We’ve looked at the game against England and how we can improve and I’m sure as we go through the week we’ll have a good look at Scotland. But we know that they are a team that likes to play expansive rugby; they’re a dangerous team.

‘They are definitely a team that is improving on the international stage … and if they’re going to get better it’s through playing the kind of rugby that they are. They’ve got a good coach and so, yes, we’ve got to prepare really well because it’s going to be a big battle come Saturday.’
