He's more accustomed to a chauffeur-driven limo, but yesterday Prince Charles tried a Harley Davidson for size.

He was meeting bikers from the Royal British Legion Riders Club at St James’s Palace as part of London Poppy Day.

Next time, perhaps, he should come along in his leathers and boots rather than his suit and brogues.

During the meeting, a biker sent a message to Prince Charles - via a very rude badge on his jacket that he hoped he'd notice.

The unknown man, from the Royal British Legion Riders Branch, was dressed in a leather waistcoat covered in badges, and had the not-so-subtle message sewn onto the back of it.

It is not known if the Prince noticed it, but it read: 'F*** off I don't like you'.

The Prince of Wales shook hands with the bikers as he was meeting Poppy Appeal volunteers and celebrity supporters.

Charles didn't notice

Charles greeted those working to raise
money on board the London Poppy Day red bus at Clarence House as part 
of the campaign to raise £1million in a single day from donations 
across the capital.

TV 
presenter and Poppy Day ambassador Ben Shephard said Charles spent some 
time joking and laughing when he boarded the Routemaster.

'We thought we could try and drive off with him on the bus and launch a ransom to raise more money,' Mr Shephard said.

'But he thought we wouldn’t get very far.'

Charles also joked about having a sing-along on the bus and riding a Harley Davidson.

The Prince then met volunteers inside 
Clarence House’s Poppy Day counting room, where the money raised is 
rapidly counted in machines.

Hundreds
of volunteers have the important job of tallying the funds at five 
counting stations across London including, for the first time, the one 
at Clarence House.

Richard 
Atkinson, a banker and volunteer counter at Clarence House, said Charles
wanted to know how the money counting machines worked.

'He was very intrigued and tried to understand the logistics of how this final part of the process works,' Mr Atkinson said.

'He was also very interested to know what we all did as day jobs as well.'

This year the volunteers, representing
the Army, Navy, RAF and a host of companies, aim to raise £1 million in
a single day across the capital, more than twice what was raised on 
London Poppy Day 2011.

The countdown to £1 million will take place in Covent Garden where an electronic totaliser will update the amount raised.

During
the Poppy Appeal, the Royal British Legion is aiming to raise £42 
million - £2 million more than last year’s record £40 million - to carry
out vital work, including providing immediate support and life-long 
care to armed forces families in need.

Other Poppy Day events began today at 
Covent Garden piazza with the arrival of the London Poppy Day 
Routemaster, which will tour the capital throughout the day.

Fundraising efforts of 2,000 volunteers, who will collect money at Tube and railway stations, will be spurred on by numerous military bands playing at locations across the capital.

The Military Wives Choir will lend their support to the day, performing on the steps of St Paul’s and in Covent Garden.

A team of Royal Marines will abseil down Broadgate Tower.
