A former member of one of the most notorious university fraternities in America has spoken of his experiences being beaten, locked in a basement and forced to stand in a waist-high bucket of ice as part of his attempts to join the exclusive organisation.

Justin Stuart, who was 19 at the time, was an aspiring member - or 'pledge' - in a branch of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at Salisbury University in Maryland. Along with others, he was subjected to cruel and dangerous 'hazing' rituals in order to enrol in the group.

Mr Stuart spoke of how he and other pledges were forced to recite the fraternity's creed while standing in a rubbish bin full of ice, wearing only underwear, while older members poured water over him.

He also said that over an eight-week period in 2012 he was beaten with paddles, forced to drink to the point of unconsciousness and forced to dress in nappies and women's clothing.

In a particularly gruelling incident, he said a group of recruits were locked in an unlit basement for up to nine hours without food, water or toilets while an aggressive song by German metal band Rammstein was played on repeat.

Mr Stuart compared the incident to being held in Guantanamo Bay and said it was 'like torture'.

According to The Independent, Mr Stuart, who is now a student at another university, said the incidents still trouble him today.

He said: 'I have dreams of the basement sometimes. I hear the yelling.
 It sounds like theyâ€™re about to attack me. Then I wake up from my 
nightmare.'

As well as being illegal, and officially banned by Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters, any sort of 'hazing' is against the policy of the university.

Mr Stuart took his account to the universities authorities, who launched an investigation into the group, which resulted in them being suspended until the spring of this year.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which launched an appeal against the ruling but lost, will then be on probation for a further year.

Some former members of the group were so angry with the suspension that they withdrew substantial donations to the university.

The fraternity, which was founded in 1856 and has branches in almost every U.S. state, has been disciplined more than 100 times.

More than 15 branches suspended or closed since 2009. The organisation has also been linked to nine deaths related to drink, substance abuse and hazing since 2006.
