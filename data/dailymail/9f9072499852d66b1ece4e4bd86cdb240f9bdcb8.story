The majority of small investors who took part in the stampede for shares in Royal Mail will get less than half of the stock they wanted – with 36,500 people getting nothing.

More than £37billion, including £4billion from ordinary savers, was offered, but they were chasing just £1.7billion of shares that were available to buy.

Yesterday the Prime Minister hailed today’s flotation of the State-owned giant as ‘a piece of popular capitalism’, with an extraordinary 730,000 people signing up to buy shares. But in a move slammed as ‘unwise and unfair’, anybody who applied for more than £10,000 of shares will get nothing.

Sell-off: Business Secretary Vince Cable has made clear that small investors applying for the minimum £750 stake in Royal Mail will be prioritised for shares

Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said the decision to freeze out wealthier investors ‘struck the right balance’.

Even the government has been surprised by the level of interest in the privatisation of Royal Mail.

More than 700,000 people applied for shares, making it seven times over-subscribed.

Shares
were initially priced at between 260p and 330p, but the stampede from 
investors means ministers have opted for the top price of 330p, which 
would value Royal Mail at around £3.3 billion.

The government is selling 52.2 per cent of the company, arguing private money is needed to ensure its future survival.

Royal Mail has had to adapt to changing demands, as we post fewer letters but more parcels as we shop more online.

'Conditional share dealing', where City institutions can buy and sell the shares, will begin on Friday.

Full trading will begin next Tuesday, October 15, when all investors can buy and sell shares in Royal Mail.

Everybody who applied for £10,000 or 
less of shares will get the same amount – 227 shares equal to £749.10. 
The minimum they could apply for was £750.

A
No 10 source said: ‘If you are investing £100,000 or even £20,000 in 
shares, then there is frankly an argument that being presented with £750
of shares would be little more than an annoyance.’

Of the 730,000 small investors who wanted to buy shares, a  minority – 93,000 – had actually wanted only £750 worth.

Last
night, official figures from the Department for Business showed around 
two-thirds of people received less than half of the shares they had 
applied for.

To add to their
frustration, unsuccessful small shareholders have to wait until as late
as October 21 to get their money back, according to the detail buried 
in the 447-page report.

In a
controversial move, they will not receive a single penny in interest on
their money, but the Government will scoop interest on the enormous 
cash pile. Private investors had the money immediately removed from 
their debit card, or cheque cashed, for the full amount that they wanted
to buy. As a result, they handed over around £4billion, but will get 
just £568million of shares, leaving around £3.4billion of money earning 
interest until the deadline for the money to be refunded.

This could trigger a windfall of around £2million, according to calculations by the financial website Moneycomms.

City
institutions were also turned down in massive numbers. Of the 800 
institutions who wanted to buy shares in Royal Mail, 500 were turned 
away, a process knowing as ‘zeroing’.

Sources
reveal ‘a small number’ of hedge funds were  allowed to buy shares, 
although Mr Cable insisted earlier in the week that only ‘responsible, 
long-term institutional investors’ would be permitted.

The
scale of the interest in Royal Mail fuels fears that the privatisation 
was chronically under-valued. Lord Forsyth, former Conservative cabinet 
minister, said: ‘Clearly the pricing has been wrong.

Staff benefits: All Royal Mail employees will be eligible for a chunk of free shares in the company and could stand to make a substantial profit

‘Clearly they could have been more optimistic about the appetite of small investors.’

The
shares, which will begin conditional trading on the stock market today,
were given a price range of between £2.60 and £3.30. Yesterday they 
were priced at the top end of the range at £3.30 each, amid widespread 
speculation that they could reach £4 or more today.

Dr
Tim May, chief executive of the Wealth Management Association, which 
campaigns for small shareholders, said: ‘Even if it is legal, it seems 
unwise and unfair.’ The Government – which used to be Royal Mail’s only 
shareholder – will retain a stake of nearly 38 per cent in the business.
