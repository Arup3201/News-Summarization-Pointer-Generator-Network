A mother-of-one dropped nearly eight stone in weight through a 'foodtography' diet inspired by the internet craze which sees social network users share photographs of what they are eating. 

Gillian Gray, 41, from Fife, was fed up of squeezing into size 24 jeans, so vowed to transform her eating habits with a status update on Facebook.

She was so touched by the encouraging comments from friends and family that she began regularly posting pictures of the new low-calorie meals. They were all cooked by her supportive husband Steven, with whom she has a 12-year-old daughter, Chloe.

Before her Facebook diet, Gillian weighed 17 stone. This picture of her on holiday inspired her to finally lose weight (l). She posted this pictured to her online supporters after losing six-and-a-half stone (r)

She said: 'I think it's great when people post pictures of their meals on Facebook so when Steven first made me a healthy dinner - a plate of delicious chilli prawns - I posted a picture because I was so impressed something healthy could taste so good.

'Friends and family posted so many lovely comments about my diet, which really motivated me.

'When the weight started coming off I began posting pictures of myself as I got smaller and smaller.'

In just over a year, Gillian shrunk seven dress sizes and dropped to a healthy ten stone, having previously weighed nearly 18 stone.

Gillian's weight began to creep up when Steven, then her boyfriend, moved into the family home in 1992 and began cooking for her and her mum, Barbara, now 60, and sister, Val, now 39.

The pair wed in 1994 and moved into their own house in Dunfermline, Fife, but Steven continued to cook meals fit for four.

Gorging on Steven's lasagne and home baking, Gillian piled on the pounds and was already a size 18 by the time she fell pregnant with daughter Chloe in 2000.

Reality only hit home when saw a picture of herself on a caravan holiday in Wales in August 2011.

She said: 'I knew I had got bigger, but Steven always told me I looked lovely so I convinced myself I wasn't bothered.

The sixth and seventh meals Gillian posted on Facebook, salmon (l) and chicken and apricot meatloaf (r)

'But when I saw that picture, I was horrified. I knew I had to go on a diet and joined a slimming club.'Stepping on the scales, I couldn't believe I was 17st 10lbs.'

To combat her nerves, Gillian posted the first meal in her new regime of low-fat, portion-controlled diet on Facebook, and received dozens of supportive messages and 'likes'. 

Enormously encouraged, she posted updates and pictures of her meals every evening. 

Word of her online diet diary spread and soon she was receiving Facebook friend requests from people she had never met, desperate for tips on healthy eating.

She said: 'The effect on my confidence was amazing. Within a week of posting the picture of my first meal, I'd lost nearly 4lbs.

'I was also inspired to start exercising and I was soon walking everywhere.

'Friends of friends who wanted to lose weight also added me on Facebook so they could see the meals Steven was making for me.'

Four months later, Gillian was already three stone lighter.

Before beginning her reduced-calorie diet, breakfast for Gillian would typically involve a full cooked meal of sausage, bacon, eggs, potato scone and black pudding, followed by a mid-morning snack of crisps or chocolate with a glass of cola.

Lunch would be a Big Mac Meal and, in the evening, she would tuck into lasagna and chips, with crisps and dips to nibble on before bedtime. 

The new, health-conscious Gillian enjoys fibre-rich cereal or a poached egg for breakfast and fruit during the morning, with soup and pitta bread for lunch. Dinner typically involves low-calorie noodles and seafood, with low fat yogurt for a snack. 

But as she got closer to her target, she found it harder to shift the last few pounds - and it was the support from Facebook friends that kept her going.

She said: 'I was only losing a few pounds a week towards the end and it felt like I would never get there. 

'But people were still amazing. They kept posting messages of support, telling me I was nearly there.'Even if I had just lost a few pounds, they would spur me on by reminding me that I hadn't put any weight back on.'

Gillian hit her target just a few days before Christmas last year and celebrated by showing off her new size 10 jeans.

She said: 'The best thing was seeing the look on Steven's face. Hearing your husband tell you you're a knockout is amazing.'

Even though Gillian has reached her target, she has not abandoned her Facebook supporters.She said: 'Lots of people who have followed my journey on Facebook now want to lose weight themselves, and I'm right behind them.

'For me, social media was a brilliant motivator and I know that other people can achieve what I have by sharing their journey.

'We're still posting pictures of our dinners and now people are asking for the recipes. 

'I never thought Facebook would help me lose that much weight. Now I tell people, if I can do it, they can too.'
