The defeats get harder to take, the near misses more difficult to shrug off. Scott Brown is only 29 yet, already, the Scotland midfielder has begun to dread the creeping advance of years – and the threat of ending his career with one great football ambition frustratingly unfulfilled.

Brown, one of several in the current squad who will be in their 30s by the time France 2016 comes around, believes that the quality of the current group – the best he's seen, says the Celtic skipper – and the extended nature of the European Championships means Scotland have never had a better chance of returning to a major finals.

Yet the combative all-rounder admits that the fear of being part of yet another failed campaign – this is his fifth crack at the big time – motivates him as much as anything.

Scott Brown (centre) believes Scotland will have to show courage if they are to beat Georgia on Saturday

Brown, whose own 38-cap international career has taken in two unsuccessful tilts at reaching the Euros *and* a couple of ultimately disappointing World cup qualifying runs, said on Friday: 'I think, when I was younger, I never appreciated it as much as I did now.

'Looking back on those campaigns, I was thinking: 'Oh, we didn't get there again. We're devastated – but we'll try next time'.

'Now I'm starting to think: "I might never get there". There are a few people in that dressing room the same age as me, maybe even a wee bit older, who probably think the same way as well: "We've not got long left in the game, so we desperately want to get to a major finals".

'For Darren Fletcher, as well, this is huge. He wants to get to a Euros and it's one of the few things not on his CV, as well. Pretty much everyone in the dressing room - well maybe not young Ryan Gauld! – remembers France '98 and what a great occasion that was.

'We want to get that belief back that Scotland isn't just a team that turns up for one or two games but can do it over a whole campaign.

'France is definitely the biggest one for us. We all want to try everything to get there — leave nothing out on the park. It would mean more to us than anyone in the country. As a Scotland fan myself, I know it would be great for the whole country.

'It definitely bothers me. I don't want to look back over my career and be saying: "If I had only done this, if I'd only done that..." I've got to give 120 per cent. Everyone in that changing room is the same, giving everything to get there

'We know it's been a long time since France 98. We think we've got the quality to get there again and, with the extra qualifying place as well, that will definitely help.'

It's good to hear Scotland players talk about the hurt, acknowledging the pain of failure as keenly as the most devoted supporter. If the possibility of never making it motivates this bunch to new heights, in a campaign where the top two in each group win an invite to the expanded finals, all the better.

Brown knows expectations are high as Scotland dream of ending their 18-year exile from major tournaments

Brown, one of two frontrunners for the captaincy in Saturday's home match against Georgia, insisted on Friday that quality and a sense of shared responsibility gives this group an edge over some of its predecessors.

'It's definitely the best chance we've had to qualify, because it's the best group of lads I've been in,' he said.

'You can see the team bonding. It's not people sitting over here and there in little groups – everyone can chat to everyone.

'The manager has done a lot, bringing players in, talking to them himself. Those are maybe the little differences that will hopefully get us there.

'There is no room for egos. All the lads are down to earth – and I think they all realise that anybody could take their place.

'We've brought in the likes of Gauldy and Stevie May, who have been excellent in training this week.

'It's good to see people like that up close in training. When you play against them, you maybe don't notice how good they are unless you're directly up against them.

'When you train with them, you see how good they are at linking up. Wee Ryan has been a joy to play with.

'When you look at the squad, it's probably the strongest I've been involved with. It's looking good, training has been brilliant.

'We've played 11 v 11 with subs, as well. And you look at the subs and think: 'He could bring on anyone here and still have a strong 11'. So it's looking great.

'There are players for every position. There are 11, 12, 13 great players – and then you think: "Wow, look at the players coming in on top of that. Jeez, they could easily take someone's place". 

Brown on Scotland's qualifier: 'We've got to be brave and play attacking football especially at Ibrox as well'

Brown remains one of two frontrunners for the captaincy in Saturday's home match against Georgia

'It's great for competition, it makes everyone raise their game – and you can see that in training over the last couple of days.

'We've got top quality players so we should be at tournaments - but we need to work together as a group. We're doing that to the best of our ability now.'

On the captaincy issue, Brown remains in the dark. Full of praise for main rival Fletcher, he concedes that being handed the armband is a tremendous honour; there is more than a hint of him wanting the leadership role.

Yet he's wary not to put personal ambition before national interest, noting: 'Whoever goes out there, we've got a lot of great leaders who want to win. That's what you need.

'We are all desperate to win, all desperate to be in France. And we believe we can do it – we all believe it. It's not about fighting over a captaincy – it's about joining together and being more of a team than ever.'

Relaxed and at ease, Brown gave off the air of a man confident of his place in the squad. And Saturday's starting XI, for that matter, although he joked about the 'national debate' over the captaincy issue, saying: 'I thought that was all over … it was a no vote, wasn't it?'

As for a return to Ibrox, a venue familiar only to those Celtic players with at least a few years' service under their belts, the man who added to his cult status with one particular Old Firm goal celebration said he was looking forward to the experience.

If nothing else, being applauded at this particular stadium will be a new one for him, although he ducked an obvious question about whether he'd be 'Doing a Broony' in the event of scoring for his country, declaring: 'I don't even know if I'm playing!'

Maybe he wasn't expecting his place to be confirmed until this morning, when Gordon Strachan was due to officially announce his starting XI, subs and skipper. But Brown sounded like a man who knew he was part of the manager's plans. 

A man desperate to make every appearance count. Before it's too late.
