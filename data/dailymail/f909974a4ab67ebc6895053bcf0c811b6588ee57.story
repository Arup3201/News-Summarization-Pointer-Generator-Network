Attempts so far have been bulky and lacked functionality, but now Samsung has unveiled the world’s first smartwatch that can make and receive calls without the aid of a nearby smartphone.

LG has also debuted a more traditional-looking timepiece. Its G Watch R has a circular plastic OLED screen, stainless steel frame and a leather strap.

Samsung has unveiled what it claims is the world’s first smartwatch that can make and receive calls without the aid of a nearby smartphone. The Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit comfortably on the wearer’s wrist

All eyes will also be on Apple’s iPhone 6 launch in two weeks, to see whether the Californianfirm will also announce its own version of a smartwatch.

Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer, was early to launch a range of smartwatches and bands in a bid to counter slow earnings in its mobile division. But their appeal and functionality was limited.

Its new watch is called the Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit comfortably on the wearer’s wrist.

The watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance. The screen can be customised – as well as the colour of the straps.

It will offer 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so that users can receive notifications from social networks, calendars and apps, without needing to use their smartphone.

People wearing the device will be able to reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or ‘S voice functionality’ so they can dictate a message.

Critically, they will also be able to make and answer phone calls.

Turn-by-turn pedestrian navigation is on offer with built-in GPS, and because the watch includes sensors, it will be able to be used as a health and fitness device.

The South Korean company said the Gear S ‘expands the smartphone experience to the wrist’.

‘Through 3G connectivity, the Samsung Gear S offers a new, powerful wearable experience and gives consumers the freedom to live their life on the go.’

Samsung said that the Gear S will go on sale in October, but it is not yet known how much it will cost and whether it will be available in the UK.

LG’s watch is set to launch slightly later – sometime in the fourth quarter. No price has yet been revealed.

The company said: ‘The LG G Watch R will be the world’s first watch-style wearable device to feature a full circle Plastic OLED (P-OLED) display that utilises100 percent of its circular display.’

‘With an artisanal elegance, the LG G Watch R boasts a refined aesthetic that is reminiscent of traditional timepieces.’

The display is 1.3 inches in diameter and promises clarity when viewed from any angle, including in direct sunlight.

Samsung – the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smart watches and bands in a bid to counter slow earnings in its mobile decision. The Gear Fit (pictured left) and Gear 2 (right) had limited appeal and functionality

It will run on Google’s Android operating system, so wearers can access apps on Google Play.

Like Samsung’s offering, the watch will use voice recognition and has sensors to monitor a user’s heartbeat so that it can be used with fitness apps.

Notifications will inform users of events, missed calls, reminders and messages – but unlike Samsung’s offering, a smartphone will be needed to make a call, making the watch an accessory and not an alternative to a phone.

Dr Jong-seok Park, president and CEO of the LG Electronics, said: ‘What we’ve noticed in the year of the wearable is that this is a category that can’t be compared to smartphones and tablets.

‘Wearables are also accessories and consumers will want more than one to choose from.’

A spokesman from Carphone Warehouse told MailOnline: ‘While many mobile manufacturers have now shown their hand with at least their first foray into the wearables space, Samsung’s device marks the beginning for the next generation of smart wearable technology, in which manufacturers are beginning to really respond to evolving customer needs for more practical yet stylish devices.

‘We are getting more and more customers enquiring about smart watches and similar devices and with more sophisticated and mainstream devices coming onto the market, we anticipate that even more customers will be looking for a wearable device that resonates with their needs.’
