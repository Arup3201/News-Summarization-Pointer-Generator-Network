Supporters are keen to see Scottish football's booze ban lifted – and they have gained political backing in a bid to be put on the same footing as fans across Europe.

Despite Police Scotland still opposing even a trial scheme to allow punters a pint at the match, one senior officer has admitted that they are open to discussion – if the debate is widened 'beyond the football community'.

Supporters Direct Scotland threw their weight behind a concerted effort by football to have the ban – imposed as part of the Criminal Justice Scotland 1980 Act after an Old Firm Cup Final riot that year – lifted on a limited basis for a short trial period.

Following on from SFA chief executive Stewart Regan's confirmation that they'd been in discussions with the police, the fans' umbrella group revealed that a survey of supporters earlier this year had shown 62 per cent in an immediate scrapping of the regulations, while 72 per cent supported the idea of a small-scale trial.

Although Andrew Jenkin, Head of Supporters Direct Scotland, urged caution and pointed out that certain demographics – female supporters and the over-60s – were resistant to lifting the ban, a statement on behalf of the group said: 'Scottish football has made impressive strides in improving its image over the last 35 years, with several clubs taking greater responsibility for the health and well-being of their supporters.

'We encourage those involved in these discussions to consider all relevant factors in any decision made regarding a change to the current restriction on alcohol in Scottish football.'

Police Scotland initially responded by sticking to the same firm line they've held since 1980 – but with one small suggestion of wiggle room, as long as the public are consulted.

Assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins said: 'Police Scotland believes we should maintain the position of a no alcohol at football policy.

'That said, in recognition that this decision was made following events in the 1980s, I have had some very informal discussions with the Football Authorities.

'At that time, I made it very clear that before we entered into formal discussions, a wide ranging public consultation should be undertaken. I was keen that this should be extended beyond the footballing community as any change to our policy would have far reaching and wide social impact. To my knowledge this has not been done as yet.'

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has spoken out on this issue before, said: 'I'm pleased to see Police Scotland are prepared to engage with a wide-ranging consultation on drinking at the football.

'It's a discussion that needs to happen. We are not in the same situation we were when alcohol was banned from the stadium. Grounds are safer and the atmosphere much more family friendly in general.

'It's also unfair that, if you pay £100 for a hospitality ticket you can enjoy a drink, but ordinary fans in the stands are denied this.

'More and more stadia have alcohol licences because they host other events like concerts, but at 3pm on a Saturday the taps have to be switched off.

'Let's have a proper discussion of the issues and a pilot scheme, instead of insisting that football fans in practically every other country in Europe are responsible enough to drink at the ground, but in Scotland they are not.'
