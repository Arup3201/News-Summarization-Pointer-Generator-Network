A pro-life pregnancy center in Iowa is now offering a little-tested and unproven 'abortion reversal' treatment free-of-charge for women who regret starting the process of medically terminating a pregnancy.

Doctors at the Women's Choice Center in Bettendorf say they introduced the controversial option in response to the prevalence of Mifepristone, or RU-486, better known as the 'abortion pill'.

The pill is an alternative to a surgical abortion, which blocks progesterone and causes the uterine lining to break down, effectively stopping the pregnancy, according to Vocativ.

While the morning-after pill - also known as Plan B or emergency contraception - helps prevent pregnancy, the abortion pill - also known as a medical abortion - terminates pregnancy.

Untested: Abortion reversal is a controversial new procedure developed by a Catholic, Pro-Life doctor and offered at the Women's Choice Center in Bettendorf, Iowa

After taking Mifepristone, the patient takes a second pill, Misoprostol, between 24 and 48 hours later, which causes the uterus to empty.

The 'abortion reversal' is meant to come in during this step.

The Women's Choice Center administer progesterone treatments to patients that have taken Mifepristone but have not yet taken the second pill.

The treatments are meant to override the effects of the steroid, allowing the pregnancy to continue.

However other doctors have slammed the treatment, saying it is 'very incomplete' and 'misleading'.

The executive director of the Women's Choice Center, Vicki Tyler, believes some women will take Mifepristone and regret their decision.

'Because of our close proximity to Planned Parenthood, we knew that there would be a woman who would take that first pill and want to reverse the procedure.'

The center's medical director, Dr. Karla Polaschek, OB-GYN, learned of the treatment through Human Life International, a non-medical, Catholic, pro-life organization, and elected to begin providing it a few weeks ago, according to Vocativ.

'Because of our close proximity to Planned Parenthood (located directly across the street), we knew that there would be a woman who would take that first pill and want to reverse the procedure,' Tyler said.

'And shortly after we began providing the treatment, we received our first phone call, so we know the demand is there.'

No other clinic has advertised the service.

The Women's Choice Center does not charge patients for the progesterone treatments.

It is also yet to have a patient undergo the treatments.

Tyler says 230 other pro-life OB-GYNs are looking at offering the service.

However it has not been properly tested or proven completely effective.

Only one study has been done on the treatment and it was co-authored by the physician who developed it, Dr. George Delgado.

In the study, four of the six women who underwent progesterone treatments after taking Mifepristone had regular vaginal births.

But, crucially, the outcomes of the other two women were not listed.

The website of Dr. George Delgado's promotes progesterone therapy as an effective way to reverse a medical abortion, however it has not been properly tested and is only offered at one clinic in Iowa

'It's a very incomplete report,' Dr. Daniel Grossman, an OB-GYN and member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told Vocativ.

'It's not a clinical trial. We have no evidence that this is an effective regimen, and I would say that it is outside the standard of care to use a treatment that has not been examined in clinical trials.'

The side effects of undergoing progesterone treatments are relatively minor, and include hair loss, insomnia, breast tenderness and nausea.

However Dr. Grossman said the headlining problem with clinics offering the service is that they are misleading partients into thinking they can reverse a medical abortion.

He also said it's 'exceedingly rare' for a woman to change her mind after undergoing the necessary abortion counseling before taking the drug.

'This seems more like a media campaign than an attempt to provide a service that is actually needed,' Dr Grossman said.

'And that's on top of the fact that this treatment hasn't even been proven effective.'

On Saturday The MailOnline was contacted by Mary L Davenport, MD, FACOG, who said she was a co-author of the study of the progesterone treatments.

Dr. Davenport said that two of the six women in the study suffered miscarriages.

She said that they have further tested 106 women, and that  56 - just over half - 'have given birth to normal babies'.

However the results of that study have not been published, and do not appear on the Abortion Pill Reversal website.
