Manchester United starlet Reece James is under consideration for a call-up to the England Under-21 side after impressing on the club’s pre-season tour of the United States.

Sportsmail understands that James, 20, is being monitored closely by FA scouts and could be part of Gareth Southgate’s squad to face Lithuania and Moldova in September if he maintains his remarkable progress.

James, who grew up in Bacup in Lancashire, is yet to represent his country at youth level and a call-up by Southgate next month would cap a remarkable rise for the young left back.

England ambitions: Reece James is in line for a call up to the England Under-21s squad

Showing promise: James looked good on United's tour of the States which has boosted his international hopes

Only two years ago, James’ career in English football looked to be under threat when he was released by Preston North End as an 18-year-old but the player was handed a lifeline by United’s reserve team manager Warren Joyce.

The Reds had been aware of James for some time as his brother Matty James - who now plays for Leicester - was previously on their books.

Over the last two seasons, the player’s development has encouraged United coaches. James made more appearances for the United second-string than any other player last season and he was nominated by Joyce for the club’s Denzil Haroun Reserves’ Player of the Year trophy.

Following the departures of Patrice Evra and Alex Buttner this summer, James was invited by Louis van Gaal to be part of the United squad in the USA and he has emerged as a viable understudy for Luke Shaw in the left-wing back position in the Dutchman’s favoured 3-5-2 system.

The pair will also face competition from Ashley Young but James stated his case loud and clear in America, scoring twice against LA Galaxy and also impressing in the victory over Roma.

England scouts are thought to have been impressed by how quickly James has adapted to life under Van Gaal at Old Trafford and his rapid progress could now result in the ultimate honour of representing his country.
