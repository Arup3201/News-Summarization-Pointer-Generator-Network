The wife of Olympic rower James Cracknell has told of the moment she thought he was going to kill her.

Beverley Turner says the gold medallist tried to strangle her during an argument in the months  following a cycling accident that nearly killed him.

In a book they wrote together, the couple talk in haunting detail about their struggle to cope with the aggressive, disorientated stranger that Mr Cracknell became after suffering a brain injury in the accident two years ago.

In one chapter, his wife wrote: ‘It 
has been another long, upsetting, difficult day that culminates in 
Croyde [their nine-year-old son] crying himself to sleep after another 
hurtful telling-off from James.

‘I lose it. I say I’ve had enough and
he needs to get better elsewhere because it is too much for us. I’m 
angry and exhausted.

Sick of being bullied, I try to push past James and
he flips. He grabs me round the neck and, with one powerful hand, holds
me down on the bed. He tightens his grip until I can’t breathe.

‘I’d like to say that I couldn’t 
believe it was happening, but I could – there was a terrible 
inevitability about it. We are alone, drowning in a sea of fear, stress 
and confusion.

‘I try to take a breath. For a 
moment, I genuinely think he might kill me. I pray that a flicker of 
empathy will ignite, just for a moment, among the broken neurons 
struggling to fire in his brain, behind his deadened eyes.

‘He lets go. I grab the phone and 
lock myself in the bathroom. I call my sister, Cal, who lives round the 
corner, in a panic. “Please come round. James has just tried to strangle
me”.’

Happy families: James and Beverley's relationship was pushed to the limit

Father-of-three Mr Cracknell, 40, had
his skull smashed by the wing-mirror of a petrol tanker travelling at 
70mph on July 20, 2010, as he cycled along a lonely highway near 
Winslow, Arizona.

The double Olympic gold medallist,  
one of the greatest endurance athletes in the world, was attempting to 
travel from Los Angeles to New York in 16 days by running, cycling, 
rowing and swimming.

His brain slammed forward in the impact, crushing his frontal lobes – the part that controls personality.

Miss Turner, 38, said she asked his 
psychologist: ‘Did my husband die on July 20?’ His answer was not 
reassuring: ‘It’s hard to say.’

During the month she spent at her 
husband’s hospital bedside, Miss Turner found out that she was pregnant 
but could not tell him until much later in case the emotion brought on a
seizure.

After Mr Cracknell was discharged, 
they hoped the worst was over but the man who arrived back home in 
Chiswick, West London, was ‘not the man I married’.

‘We’re still toughing it out,’ Miss 
Turner says. ‘Every moment of my life, from the time he was in that 
hospital bed in Arizona, was about getting James back to the person he 
once was.

‘That was not a completely altruistic aim: I wanted that person back. I missed him.’

She said a motivating factor in 
writing the book, Touching Distance, the hope that one day, their 
children  – Croyde, three-year-old Kiki and  18-month-old Trixie – would
read it and understand their father better.
