Homeward bound: Justina Pelletier, 16, will be returning home to her parents in Connecticut Wednesday after spending 16 months in state custody

After 16 months spent in state custody, Justina Pelletier will be allowed to return to her parents in Connecticut Wednesday, a judge ruled this afternoon.

The founder of Liberty Counsel, a conservative law firm representing the girl's parents, said Boston Juvenile Court Judge Joseph Johnston signed a court order to release Justina to her parents in West Hartford, Connecticut.

‘We are thrilled that Justina will finally be returning home tomorrow,’ said attorney Matt Staver. ‘The family looks forward to putting this 16-month nightmare behind them.’

The 16-year-old girl has been a ward of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts since February 2013 following a dispute over the issue of her health between Justina's parents and medical professionals.

‘To hear the news is overwhelming,’ Lou Pelletier, the girl’s father, told FoxNews.com after learning of Tuesday’s ruling. ‘Now we can certainly begin the healing process.’

Justina's mother, who has been staying in a hotel near the medical facility where her daughter is being treated, got a call just before 4pm Tuesday letting her know that the judge had signed off on the teen's release.

Lou Pelletier told Hartford Courant his wife then phoned him 'screaming with happiness' at the good news.

On the Facebook page A Miracle from Justina, which the family have been using to post updates about their case and raise awareness of their daughter’s plight, an overjoyed Justina posted a brief video Tuesday evening thanking everyone who has supported her.

‘I’m so excited to be home tomorrow,’ the girl said with a broad smile on her face. ‘I can't wait. I'm just so happy to be home.’

On June 8, Justina made a tearful plea posted on the same Facebook page begging Judge Johnston and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to let her go home.

Speaking in a halting, raspy voice, an emotional Justina Pelletier said that all she wants to do is be back home with her family and friends. 

‘You can do it. You're the one that's judging this, please let me go home, Judge Johnston and Governor Patrick, please, right now,’ she said.

Judge Johnston approved the transfer of custody back to the parents after attorney Matt Staver filed a motion May 30 stating that the Pelletiers had complied with the conditions for reunification outlined by the Massachusetts secretary of Health and Human Services.

Lou Pelletier said Tuesday that the priority now is to get his daughter home and start the healing process.

‘Think of it like a prisoner of war who has been held captive for 16 months,’ he told Fox News. ‘There will be an adjustment period.’

But once Justina is safely on the road to recovery, her parents intend to pursue legal actions against the Massachusetts officials who took the girl by force from her family.

The father also plans to push for a new law that would prevent hospitals from taking custody of children using the state Department of Children and Families 'as their little wingman.'

‘This is just the beginning,’ Pelletier said. ’There's going to be a Justina law.’

Matt Staver, of Liberty Counsel, who has been working with the family for the past three months, said his team will hold the medical professionals involved in the case accountable for what he called 'absolutely total malpractice' and 'inconceivable mistake.’

The court decision returning full custody of Justina's her parents after a drawn out legal battle comes just two days after the girl was allowed to attend a barbecue Sunday with Lou and Linda Pelletier.

Despite what state social workers say was 'progress' by the Connecticut parents, Mr and Mrs Pelletier said their opinion about their daughter's diagnosis - the issue that led to them losing custody - has not changed, the Boston Globe reports.

Doctors and social workers claim 16-year-old Justina suffers from psychological problems that have left her wheelchair-bound and with severe digestive problems.

It was the Pelletiers' resistance to submitting their daughter to psychiatric treatment last year that led hospital authorities to contact Massachusetts Department of Children and Families.

On Sunday, Mr Pelletier told the Globe the psychological diagnosis is a 'scam.'

He blasted the judge who took his daughter away as 'corrupt' and promised a 'firestorm' of legal action once his daughter is returned to home for good.

The Pelletiers maintain Justina suffers from mitochondrial disorder which causes muscle pain and weakness, not a psychological problem. 

On Sunday, Pelletier was given only her second unsupervised visit with her parents at their home in Connecticut. 

Mr and Mrs Pelletier took their daughter to Cirque du Soleil for Father's Day, then brought her back to their house for a cookout with friends and her three sisters.

'She’s got pretty much freedom now,' Mr Pelletier said.

However, she still relies on a wheelchair and had to be carried into the house. Her speech is still slurred and had a tube in her intestines that must be flushed out periodically.
