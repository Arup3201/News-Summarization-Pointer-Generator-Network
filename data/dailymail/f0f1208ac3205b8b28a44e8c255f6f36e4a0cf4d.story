Sir Alex Ferguson's final title parade saw around 100,000 Manchester United fans turn out to salute their heroes as the team bus took to the streets to celebrate winning the Premier League title.

All eyes were on wantaway striker Wayne Rooney, who looked in good spirits as the bus toured the roads to the adulation of fans.

Rio Ferdinand, having sealed Ferguson's final home win with his first goal since 2008, led the celebrations, leading the fans in chants and tweeting pictures of him and his team-mates in the pub in the early afternoon.

Ferguson, who called time on his career in management last week after 27 years at the United helm, said: 'I thought that 99 could not be beaten 
but you've beaten it today. Thank you for the fantastic support. I hope 
we're here to win this many times again.

'You always think about it (whether you are doing the right thing). But I think it is the right time. I really do.

'We have a young squad, with a lot of good young players, who are going to get better.

'The big test is to win it three times in a row.

'I hope the boys can do it.'

But there was no word on whether Wayne Rooney will still be around for the start of their title defence.

Ferguson confirmed on Sunday that the 
England striker had submitted a transfer request, although added that it
had been turned down.

Rooney received a mixed reception when
he boarded the open-top bus at Old Trafford for the start of the 
parade, although he did play an active part in the celebrations as it 
made its slow way along the route into the centre of Manchester, where 
huge numbers of United fans turned out to acclaim their team.

But, speaking to MUTV, Rooney did not 
answer directly a question about what the retiring Ferguson had done for
him, and was not asked whether he would be staying or not.

'He has been brilliant for us all,' Rooney said.

'He is a great manager. He is a winner and to do it for so long is incredible.

'He is a fantastic manager and a fantastic person.'

With 20,000 fans packed into Sir Matt Busby Way, roads had to be closed prior to the Red Devils' departure.

And whilst there was space along the 
main route into the city centre, once the bus headed down the main 
shopping area, Deansgate, supporters found a variety of vantage points 
to see the team drive past.

Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Young, who 
at times ditched the crutches he is supposed to be using to nurse an 
ankle injury that has ended his season, led the singing, with Ferguson 
also joining in, and even forced Paul Scholes onto centre stage for a 
rare interview.

There was a moment of humour, as 
defender Jonny Evans was asked by MUTV interviewer Helen McConnell, who 
also happens to be his fiancee, whether he was going to have a good 
summer.

'Yes,' Evans replied. 'I am getting married, to you Helen.'

Paul Scholes, who also announced his retirement, said: 'It means everything. We set out each year to try and win the 
league and most of the years we do it. It is great to see this turnout 
and I'm so proud to play for this club.'

Ryan Giggs also admitted the reception topped the one in 1999: 'Thanks for coming out. I thought I'd never see anything
like the treble again but this beats it,' he admitted.

'It is just brilliant. It gives us a chance to share 
with the fans a great achievement this season. It is an amazing 
atmosphere.'

Robin Van Persie celebrated his first Premier League title following his move from Arsenal. 'It's incredible,' he said. 'It is even nicer than I expected - there are so many people.

'It
(winners medal) didn't leave my neck since yesterday. It is a heavy 
trophy but it is great to win it. This is for the players, fans, staff, 
every single one here. It has made so many people happy and I'm very 
pleased to see that.'

Michael Carrick added: 'I've been getting a bit carried away. I've nearly fallen off three 
times. This turnout is just amazing, the whole week has been special.

'Celebrating
winning the league but with Scholes and the manager retiring it is a 
fitting send off. I never thought we would get anything like this. I 
have been singing quite a bit lately - you can probably tell by my 
voice.'
