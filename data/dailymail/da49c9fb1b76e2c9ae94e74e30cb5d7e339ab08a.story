Speaking out: Renee, pictured, whose shocking video showing her botched butt surgery went viral has spoken out about the horror surgery for the first time

A woman who posted a shocking video online of her botched butt implants flipping inside out has spoken out about the horror surgery for the first time.

'I was showing my girlfriend how I could reach up under my implant and it just kind of flipped and freaked me out,' victim Renee explained to talk show host Trisha Goddard, describing the moment she discovered her quest for a perfect butt had gone terribly wrong.

Renee, who declined to give her last name, uploaded the 20-second clip, showing the implants protruding grotesquely, on YouTube late last year in an effort to warn others of the dangers of cut-price cosmetic surgery, and the video has been viewed more than a million times.

'I started getting really sick. I couldn't breath,' Renee added.

The woman brought the over-sized implants onto the talk show, which caused the audience to gasp in horror. She said she remained in a lot of pain after having them removed.

Renee is now urging women to ensure their cosmetic surgeon is the real deal before signing up for surgery, or better still avoid it all together.

'Love the skin you're in,' Renee said. 'Please don't go and do this stuff to yourself. If more people would come out and tell their stories then less women would go and do this.'

The distressing video that was posted online on November 27 shows two grotesque lumps bulging from Renee's buttocks, caused when her botched silicone implant 'flipped inside out'.

Instead of giving her a smooth, plump appearance, the implant pops out and is left protruding in an ugly disc shape at the back of her butt cheek.

In
 the brief clip, the unidentified woman slowly manipulates it back 
into place while explaining: 'This is my implant flipping backwards. I 
don't think an implant's supposed to do that. It shouldn't be able to 
flip.'

One
 user, Donna Wright-Levy, commented: 'I prefer to go harder on the 
squats, lunges, hamstring curls and the gluteous kickbacks...'

Kader SmileyFace said: 'Uh!! Why would she want a bigger ass!'

The video was initially suspected to be a fake because Renee posted no details about which clinic she went to or exactly what type of procedure she had.

But BAAPS Member Adrian Richards, a consultant plastic surgeon at Aurora Clinics in the UK, said back in December that the clip was authentic.

He said the 'flipping' problem occurs
 when the implant is not secured firmly enough in a pocket the surgeon 
creates either between the buttock and the pelvic bone or on top of the 
gluteus maximus.

'It is
 a complication which is relatively common following buttock implants. 
It shouldn't really happen because the pocket should be snug so the 
implant stays where it is.

Miffed: The woman adds: 'I don't think an implant's supposed to do that. It shouldn't be able to flip'

'This lady's implant is flat on the bottom and coned on the top, but this one has flipped over.'

He said it wouldn't be painful, but would likely need to be removed or the pocket closed up to stop it shifting around.

Buttock implants are popular in South America, where plump bottoms are regarded as sexually desirable.

In recent years, plastic surgery 
experts have been warning women not to have operations in unapproved 
clinics after a string of deaths and dodgy practices.

To insert the implant, an incision is usually made where the cheek meets the back of the thigh or in the buttock crease where the scars are less noticeable.

The surgeon then creates a pocket large enough to insert the silicone either under the gluteus maximus muscle or on top of it.

Sometimes fat is taken by liposuction from another area of the body to enhance the shape of the buttocks.

The surgeon will then make sure both buttocks are symmetrical before stitching up the wounds.

But if the pocket is made too big, the implant can slip out.

The procedure is normally performed under general anaesthetic.

An alternative method involves injecting fat into the buttocks.

In April last year, a 42-year-old mother-of-three died after buttock implant surgery at a backstreet Las Vegas clinic.

Elena Caro's family begged her not to 
have the operation, saying she was beautiful as she was, but she went 
ahead with the surgery.

She was found crying in agony and begging for help after an unlicensed Colombian doctor allegedly dumped her by the side of the road when the procedure went wrong and she died in hospital a short time later.

In December 2009, a former Miss Argentina who was obsessed with maintaining her youthful looks died following surgery to make her buttocks firmer.

Solange Magnano, 38, was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation.

The mother of eight-year-old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care.

Atlanta woman Kimberly Smedley was jailed for three years in July after injecting customers' buttocks with commercial silicone in hotel rooms and using glue and cotton balls to prevent the substance from leaking out.

Federal prosecutors believe Smedley made at least $1.3 million while operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York.

In cases where silicone jabs are used, the procedure can cause a blood clot to the lungs known as a pulmonary embolism.
