A male Las Vegas club promoter has landed in hot water for allegedly telling a woman trying to plan a friend’s bachelorette party not to bring 'whales' and 'hippos' to the sin city hotspot.

The exchange between a host at Hakkasan nightclub at MGM Grand Casino named Peter and a Southern California resident named Zoe went viral this week when the Gawker blog Jezebel posted screenshots of the text messages online.

Zoe explained that she contacted the club promoter asking to arrange a comp - or a complimentary table - at the club for the bride and her 14 friends.

Vegas standards: A promoter at Hakkasan Las Vegas has been suspended for telling a woman organizing a bachelorette party that she cannot bring any patrons who look like 'hippos' or 'whales'

'In the past, clubs/promoters/hosts have tended to go out of their way to provide a great experience for the bride, and the group, and occasionally throw in a few extras to make the evening special. This is why I asked if it was possible to get a comped table.,’ Zoe told Jezebel.

When the woman reached out to the club host asking to make her friends' upcoming party extra special, the man demanded pictures of all 15 invitees.

When Zoe replied that she did not have the guests' photos, Peter wrote back to her saying that the club is not going to offer 'comped' tables 'to random girls.'

'Then the club will be filled with hippos,' the host allegedly texted. 'That's not what Hakkasan is about.'

He later reiterated his point, saying, 'We don't comp anything ugly.'

Zoe retorted by writing to Peter the promoter that she does not think the bachelorette party will have a problem booking a complimentary table in Las Vegas.

'Other clubs yes, but not at the #1 club in America!' Peter boasted. 

The two 
continued firing off text messages arguing over the photos of the 
would-be guests, with the promoter repeatedly pressing Zoe to give him 
her and the other women's Twitter or Instagram accounts.

Zoe
 noted that it would be a waste of her time to gather 15 photos of  people 
she did not even know, to which the opinionated Hakkasan promoter 
replied: 'so if you don't know them, how do you know they’re not whales 
or hippos?'

The
 self-appointed arbiter of female beauty opined that since the group is 
coming from Massachusetts, where according to Peter 'girls don't go to 
the gym,' it would be hard to find 15 women who are all ‘9-10s.'

At
 the conclusion of their back-and-forth, Peter invited Zoe to come to the
 club with her bridal party pals anyway and then 'ditch the whales' 
once she was inside.

Only for VIPs: Peter the club host boasted that the No 1 club in America is not for 'random girls' and said that women from Massachusetts likely do not go to the gym

The written exchange, which Zoe shared with Jezebel, was accompanied by screenshots of what Peter has described as Hakkasan's policy on complimentary tables.

Male patrons who wish to book a table for a bachelor party are not required to submit their photos, but they must pay a minimum of $4,000, according to the alleged rules of the establishment.

In the aftermath of the outage sparked by the offensive text messages, the management of Hakkasan released a statement distancing itself from the rogue promoter, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

‘Hakkasan Group prides ourselves on providing our guests with an unmatched level of customer service,’ said Nick McCabe, President of Hakkasan Group.

‘The statements made by this individual, who has since been terminated from the company, do not represent our corporate policy or our views. This type of attitude and communication is totally unacceptable, and while we cannot control every piece of communication between our thousands of staff and guests, we will not tolerate anything less than impeccable customer service.’

The nightclub later clarified that Peter the host has not been outright fired, but rather suspended pending an investigation into the incident.
