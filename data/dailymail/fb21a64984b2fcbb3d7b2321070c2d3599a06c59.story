Manchester City academy graduate Kieran Trippier will return to the Etihad Stadium for the first time with Burnley on Sunday afternoon and admits that his chances of breaking into City’s first team were handicapped by the club’s massive spending.

Clarets right-back Trippier spent 12 years at City, playing alongside Daniel Sturridge in the FA Youth Cup winning team in 2008.

‘It was always our dream to play week in, week out in the Premier League,’ said the 24-year-old.

Trippier didn’t make a first-team appearance at City, as the club signed a succession of defenders. 

'When Sven-Goran Eriksson was manager I was travelling with the first team.

‘He liked me. As a young lad at Manchester City it was difficult.

'They spent millions on players and I realised it was my time to leave, and now I’m back in the Premier League.’

Burnley will be looking to pull of a huge shock at the home of the champions on Sunday afternoon

Sam Vokes could make his first start for Burnley since rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in March. 

The striker insists his side can pull off a surprise.

‘You saw Stoke go to City and win,’ he added. ‘The pressure is off us. We can go and play.’
