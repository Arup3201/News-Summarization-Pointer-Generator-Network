The woman whose shocked face amid the carnage of the Boston Marathon bombings became an image of the terror has broken her silence to speak out about the life-changing attack.

Nicole Gross, 31, and her sister Erika Brannock, 29, attended the marathon on April 15 to cheer for their mother - and were left with devastating injuries and fears of further attacks.

In the interview alongside her sister, Brannock revealed how she suffered nightmares after one of the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was moved to her hospital as she recovered from an amputated leg.

'When I would go in for surgeries, I would 
pass by the ICU where he was,' she told CBS. 'I started having nightmares that he was 
going to get out of his bed... I thought he was going to blow the hospital
up.'

As well as losing her leg, Brannock, an elementary school
teacher, suffered a compound fracture, a broken ankle and
a broken foot to her right leg. She also suffered burns and loss of hearing.

Gross, a fitness instructor from Charlotte, North Carolina, broke her left leg in two places, suffered a fractured right ankle and a severed Achilles' tendon. She was released from hospital on Friday.

In the interview with CBS, Gross said that the iconic photograph of her surrounded by blood and debris had at first been too much to look at.

'At first I could only look at my face, it was too much to see the surroundings,' she said. 'But I remember exactly what I was going through... confusion and fear.'

Both of the sisters said that at the moment the bomb was detonated near the finish line, everything slowed - and then fell silent.

'I was scared for dear life that another bomb was going to go off and I was going to die,' Gross said, wiping away her tears.

'There's guilt because I moved Erika and I closer to exactly where the bomb went off,' she said. 'I wish I could take everything Erika's been through and put it on my body.'

The sisters, who wept as they looked at each other and recounted their stories, said that the tragedy had brought them much closer.

'It's a closeness that I think is 
indescribable,' Gross said. 'We were able to communicate our love for 
one another in a way we weren't able to before.

'We were right on top of each other when it happened and we're going to be side by side no matter where we are forever.'

Brannock remains in hospital in Boston but has plans to return to her pre-school classroom. Gross has returned to Charlotte, where she lives with her husband of seven years, Michael.

Gross, who is regarded as one of the best female triathletes in North Carolina, will continue to undergo physical therapy for her injuries.

'I know that Iâ€™ll take my competitiveness into my rehab,' Gross told the Charlotte Observer after she arrived home. 'Whatever happens from there will be great. If it's competing or if it's just casually working out, at least I can be active again.'
