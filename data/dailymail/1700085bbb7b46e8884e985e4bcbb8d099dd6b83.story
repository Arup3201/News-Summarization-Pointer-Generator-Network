Prince Harry spent yesterday signing forms to ensure he receives a £200-a-week bonus for flying  combat missions against the Taliban in Afghanistan.

The tax-free gratuity – awarded to all troops in the war zone – will be added to the £38,931 captain’s salary the Prince receives for piloting an Apache helicopter gunship.

But there is little chance that Harry will be able to spend the extra cash on Christmas presents – the bonus is paid at the end of a tour of duty, and the Prince is not expected to return home until January.

The so-called Operational Allowance is paid at a rate of £29.02 for every day served in the war zone.

Harry,
27 – known as Captain Wales to his colleagues – arrived in Afghanistan 
on Thursday night as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, 
Army Air Corps.

Another
Apache pilot said: ‘Each time we serve in Afghanistan, it is for four 
months – and no holidays in Britain, or Las Vegas, while we’re there. We
get a lot of stick from the soldiers on the ground because their tours 
last six months rather than four, but our jobs are more mentally 
demanding. Harry has the backing of everyone in the Army Air Corps. He 
performed very well in training and was too good in the Apache to be 
ordered to “fly a desk’’ – what we call office duties.

‘He’ll fly his first operational sorties with a pilot from the outgoing squadron, probably at the end of this week. 662 Squadron are taking over from 664 Squadron who have been in Helmand province since May.’

Harry is said to be popular with his colleagues – who were quick to test his sense of humour. He was mocked after winning an award for his skills on a course in Arizona.

The pilot added: ‘Before his training out there, nobody had heard of an award for best gunner. So the joke ran that it was made up by the Americans just for him.’

Last night, Harry was completing his RSOI
(Reception, Staging, Onward-Movement and Integration) training at Camp 
Bastion – the main British base in Helmand Province. Demonstrations 
included what to do if he finds a suspect package and if Bastion comes 
under rocket attack.

Anyone who sees a suspicious object is responsible for establishing a cordon and alerting the camp guards. Concerns that explosives will be smuggled into Bastion have triggered a security upgrade. More than 100 troops are on permanent guard, with military police and dogs on standby. To enhance Harry’s security, he will also be shadowed by close protection officers.

They will eat in the same canteen and share the Prince’s accommodation. To guard against a terrorist attack by a Taliban undercover agent, Afghan troops are not allowed near him.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that a threat assessment had been undertaken prior to Harry’s deployment – to ensure his presence in Helmand would not put him or his colleagues at greater risk.
