The parents of Wales international centre Owen Williams have arrived in Singapore to be with their son after he suffered a serious injury.

Williams was hurt while playing for Cardiff Blues in the inaugural World Club 10s tournament two days ago.

No details of Williams' condition have so far been released, but he is understood to have suffered a neck injury.

Messages of support have poured in for the 22-year-old on social media from international team-mates like Alex Cuthbert, Jamie Roberts, George North, Dan Lydiate, Ken Owens and Josh Turnbull, in addition to Australia back-row star David Pocock.

Gloucester Rugby Club, Leinster, the Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons have also expressed support on Twitter for Williams, in addition to Cardiff City Football Club under the hashtag #StayStrongForOws.

While the Blues squad has now returned home, Williams' playing colleague Macauley Cook has remained with him in a Singapore hospital, alongside two members of the Blues' back-room staff, Press Association Sport understands.

Williams was injured in a third and fourth place play-off game between the Blues and Asia Pacific Dragons, which took place at Singapore National Stadium.

The Blues issued an initial statement on Monday, in which they thanked fans for their support of Williams, but there has since been no further comment.

Williams has won four Wales caps, making his debut during last year's tour to Japan and then scoring a try in a 17-7 Millennium Stadium victory over Tonga seven months ago.

Williams has also represented Wales at under-20 level and on the international world sevens circuit, while he joined the Blues' senior set-up after progressing through the region's academy system.

His former club Aberdare, meanwhile, have postponed a presentation event that was planned for next Saturday to recognise ex-Aberdare players who achieved international honours.
