They have made well over 1000 appearances between them for Barcelona, but Andres Iniesta has admitted that he sometimes struggles to play in the same team as Xavi.

The pair are Barcelona legends, having been at the club since the beginning of their careers, but after their win at the weekend Iniesta produced some surprising comments about his oldest team-mate and friend.

'Sometimes I get the feeling that it seems we can't play together,' Iniesta told Marca.

'But it is always a privilege to be by his side because not only does he make your job easier, but he also makes the team work better.

'Sometimes, as with all players, things don't work out. We have been together for a long time now and the feelings are always very good, though.'

At 30 and 35 respectively, Iniesta and Xavi have had long and illustrious careers at the Nou Camp, collecting trophy after trophy under a number of different managers.

Since Iniesta made his debut in 2002, the pair have been regulars in the first team at Barcelona

But together they have remained, and when Barcelona took to the field to face Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, there they were in the midfield once more.

Barcelona trounced Rayo Vallecano 6-1 to take them top of La Liga for the first time since October.

Perhaps a rare feat this season, but something wonderfully ordinary for two players that have spent all of their careers at the very top of the game.

Iniesta though, is still focused on the matches to come. Eibar in the league, Manchester City in the Champions League, and then a Clasico to potentially decide the title.  

'More important than being at the top or not is the general feeling of the team after the game we just played,' Iniesta continued. 

'We feel good and have to continue along that line. We have two or three months left to go - not long, but the most complicated part.'
