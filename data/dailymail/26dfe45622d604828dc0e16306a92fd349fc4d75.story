A Christopher Walken look-a-like who allegedly tried to abduct a student from a New Jersey college campus nearly three years ago has been found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Tony Kadyhrob, 70, was arrested in March
2011 after trying to force a 19-year-old woman into his car at Rider 
University’s Lawrence campus.

He has been held in Trenton Psychiatric Hospital since Superior Court Judge Pedro Jimenez ruled last December that he was unfit to stand trial.

The ruling on Kadyhrob’s sanity was actually made last month, but he hadn’t present and had never been informed of the decision.

Kadyhrob eventually discovered the outcome during a court hearing on Monday and he expressed his surprise at the ruling, reports NJ.com. 

‘I’m in the dark. I really have no idea what’s going on around me,’ he told Jimenez.

Kadyhrob also complained to the judge that he had tried to dismiss his attorney Jennifer Gottschalk. ‘I fired her,’ Kadyhrob said. ‘I have no idea why she’s here right now.’

Kadyrhob’s sister originally retained Gottschalk as private council, but Jimenez requested she stay on the case after Kadyrhob attempted to fire her.

She blamed a scheduling error for Kadyrhob having missed his last court date.

‘Somehow, the facility where he is right now did not get contacted,’ she said. ‘This is the first opportunity we’ve all been present.’

Kadyhrob was declared unfit to stand trial last year after being evaluated by multiple mental health experts.

'He is in a mental unit. He is a paranoid schizophrenic. He hears voices,' his sister explained in 2011. 'He is not a criminal. He has been ill for about 30 years. This is the first time that he has been in trouble.’

Kadyhrob must undergo another competency assessment before an April court appearance.

One of the reasons that Kadyhrob was positively identified was because he looks uncannily like actor Christopher Walken, star of films such as The Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction and King Of New York.

When Kadyhrob's mugshot had been circulating on the internet at the time of his initial arrest, people had been asking if he is related to Walken because of the close resemblance. He is not.
