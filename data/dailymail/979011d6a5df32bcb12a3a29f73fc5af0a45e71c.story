West Bromwich Albion are keen on signing Norwich City left-back Martin Olsson.

The talented left back has been linked to West Ham but new Albion boss Alan Irvine wants the 26-year-old to join him in the Midlands.

Olsson is highly rated by West Brom and he could make a move after Norwich were relegated from the Premier League.

Target: Olsson played against Albion in the Premier League and could now join them ahead of next season

Keen: The full back is thought to be highly rated by new Albion manager Alan Irvine
