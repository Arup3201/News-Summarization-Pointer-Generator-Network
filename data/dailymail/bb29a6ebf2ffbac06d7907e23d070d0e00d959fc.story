The first thing you notice as Charlotte Nott rides the tricyle she found under the Christmas tree is the sheer delight on her face.

It’s only at second glance that her battle to do the things other children take for granted becomes apparent.

Charlotte, five, beat incredible odds to survive meningitis almost three years ago.

But doctors had to amputate her arms and legs below the elbow and knees during her fight for life.

After her ordeal there was no way she could ride the bike her parents, Jenny and Alex, had bought for her around the time she became ill.

Only a month before she was rushed to hospital, the schoolgirl had fallen in love with a bike and Jenny, 32, and Alex, 32, had secretly bought it, hoping to surprise their oldest daughter on Christmas day.

Full-time mum Jenny, who is now separated from Alex, said: ‘Charlotte had never had a proper bike of her own before she became ill.

‘But she’d fallen in love with cycling after being given a little tricycle by her cousin. She used to spend hours on it, pedalling for miles and miles. 

Strong support: After £400 was raised through a fund to help her through life after the 2011 operation, Charlotte is able to ride her very own first bike, specially made to her measurements, that works with her new prosthetic legs

‘Before Christmas we took her on a 
shopping trip and she set her heart on a little bike she spotted in one 
of the shops. It was lovely – blue with yellow flowers and bees on it.

‘As
 soon as she got on it she was zooming off all over the shop. She loved 
it so much we couldn’t get her to leave. In the end we had to carry her 
out kicking and screaming.

‘Alex and I bought it secretly and couldn’t wait to give it to her. We were probably more excited than her that year.

‘But we didn’t get the chance because Charlotte was rushed to hospital and she didn’t come out again until January.’

Charlotte had been a normal, healthy two-year-old before meningococcal septicaemia struck.

Two weeks before Christmas Day 2011, Jenny discovered the purple marks associated with the infection on Charlotte’s chest and she was rushed to nearby John Radcliffe hospital.

Within hours, the little girl suffered multiple-organ failure and doctors were fighting to save her life.

As the infection spread, Charlotte developed gangrene from septicaemia and medics were forced to amputate her limbs in January 2011.

Jenny said: ‘It’s hard to recall everything that happened because I was in shock. It was like I was on another planet.

‘One thing that I do remember doing is going to pick up Charlotte’s bike from the shop and taking it to the hospital on Christmas day.

‘We got permission from the doctors to put it by her bed in intensive care. It was absolutely heartbreaking.

‘Charlotte was barely conscious and wasn’t really aware it was there - it was more for us. We wanted to see her with her present.’ Charlotte left hospital in January and, since then, she has shown incredible courage adapting to life as a quadruple amputee.

But she has never been able ride the bike she had fallen in love with that Christmas three years ago.

Jenny said: ‘Charlotte tried desperately hard to ride the bike. She would spend an hour just trying to cycle three metres.

‘It was incredibly difficult for her – no matter how much effort she put in, she struggled to turn the pedals with her prosthetic legs.

‘It was one of her biggest frustrations, but she was determined.

She added: ‘In the years since, she has asked for a bike every Christmas and every birthday. It’s the only thing she really wanted.

‘We looked everywhere and Charlotte tried out so many bikes but nothing seemed to work. There was almost a point when I did feel like we’d have to give up.’

After years of searching, Charlotte’s dreams were finally answered this August when the family attended National Paralympic Day in London and Charlotte’s eyes fell on three-wheeled bike, made by Pashley.

Jenny said: “The last thing we looked at was the bike area, which was run by Bikeworks.

“They were packing up for the day but we asked if Charlotte could have a go on a three-wheeler that she had spotted.

“The next thing you know, she’s on the bike and she’s cycling up and down like there’s no tomorrow.

“It was absolutely incredible. We’d waited so long but we’d finally found a bike that was the right fit for Charlotte.” After doing some research online, Jenny discovered a Pashley stockist close to her home.

Using £400 raised through Charlotte’s trust fund, she was able to buy a three-wheeler that was custom made to her daughter’s measurements.

Incredibly, she even managed to convince Pashley to break with tradition and make the bike pink – Charlotte’s favourite colour.

The design was completed just in time to be wrapped and placed under the tree for Christmas.

And today Charlotte can’t hide her delight as she zooms along the cycle path close to her home, turning the pedals with her brand new sparkly silver legs, which were also made just in time for Christmas by Dorset Orthopaedic.

Jenny said: “Charlotte has waited so long and she’s been so patient so it was so incredible to be able to finally give her her first bike this Christmas.

“The look on her face when she’s riding it is just pure delight. It’s so heart-warming to see.

“It really has cheered us all up too. It shows how far we’ve all come since that day in December three years ago.

“Everyone remembers getting their first bike but I think Charlotte will really treasure this moment for the rest of her life.”
