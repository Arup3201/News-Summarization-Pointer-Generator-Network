It's the ideal present for the Apple diehard in your life - coffee with tech boss Tim Cook, a chance to get the inside track on the next generation of hot gadgets.

But this meeting of minds doesn't come cheap - the chance to meet Steve Jobs's successor is being auctioned for charity, and its price currently stands at $605,000 (£395,000).

The identity of the highest bidder is unknown, but is likely to be from a tech professional hoping to pitch an idea to Mr Cook or solicit business advice from him.

Meeting: Coffee with Apple CEO Tim Cook is being auctioned off for at least $605,000 (£395,000)

The auction is being run online by Charitybuzz, and its proceeds will go to a leading human rights charity.

However, the runaway popularity of the unique opportunity appears to have taken organisers by surprise - they predicted Mr Cook would fetch just $50,000.

The winner of the auction will be invited to the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they will share a drink with the company's CEO.

The encounter, which must take place in the next year, will last between 30 minutes and an hour.

Winners will be banned from taking photographs of the event or revealing any details to the press, thanks to Apple's notorious secrecy policies.

Venue: The meeting will take place at Apple's hi-tech headquarters in Cupertino, California

The auction price has now spiralled so high that Charitybuzz is only accepting bids from buyers who are authenticated by a bank.

The profit will go to the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights.

As of this morning, the highest bidder was a high roller known only as 'J********n', who will discover whether or not he has won when the auction closes at 3pm PDT (10pm GMT) today.

Many of the other people who have bid on the coffee morning are entrepreneurs who planned to pitch their start-ups to Mr Cook in the hope of receiving funding, inside information or even just advice.

Among the bidders have been firms which make accessories for Apple devices, as well as the maker of a free Bible app.

Succession: Mr Cook took over from Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs in 2011

Rakesh Kumar, founder of Drbluetooth.com, has roped in a group of generous friends and relatives to subsidise his bid for the meeting with Mr Cook, who took over at Apple after Steve Jobs resigned shortly before his death in 2011.

'It would give us a chance to showcase the whole concept of what we're doing to him,' he told the Guardian.

Mr Kumar predicts that if he wins the high-profile meeting, his firm will quickly become one of Silicon Valley's hottest tickets and attract the attention of investors.

At $605,000, the auction is tantalisingly close to being the most expensive Charitybuzz has ever hosted - in March, it auctioned off a top-of-the-range Lamborghini for $610,000.

A meeting with Bill Clinton brought in just $255,000 - two and a half times cheaper than coffee with Mr Cook.

Tech fans keen to meet a high-powered businessman for a slightly more affordable price might like to bid on lunch with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, currently available for $15,600.
