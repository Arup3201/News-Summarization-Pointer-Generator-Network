The exact spot upon which Jesus stood as he was sentenced to death, may have been pinpointed by archaeologists in Jerusalem.

Discovered around 15 years ago, the remains of Herod the Great’s palace have been carefully examined and a place between a gate and uneven stone pavement has been identified as fitting the description of the event in the Gospel of John.

Pilgrims and tourists will be able to visit the Biblical site, because tours are being offered by the Tower of David Museum, which is located nearby.

Archaeologists suspected the site’s religious and historical significance when they uncovered parts of foundation walls of the palace and an underground sewage system, when excavating an abandoned prison, The Washington Post reported. 

While historians largely agree that Herod’s palace stood in the west of Jerusalem’s Old City, whether Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate inside it, is the subject of much debate.

This is mainly due to differing interpretations of the Gospels.

Some academics believe the place where Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate lies within Herod the Great’s palace in the west of the old city of Jerusalem.

They came across architectural features matching a description in the Gospel of John.

Architectural features in a place between a gate and uneven stone pavement fits the description in the New Testament.

But some experts maintain that Jesus was likely tried in the barracks of Antonia Fortress, which lies near Temple Mount.

The building had been used as a prison by the Ottoman Turks and occupying British forces.

Over 15 years of excavation, the site has revealed symbols scratched into the walls of jails by members of the Jewish resistance in the 1940s, as well as basins from the Crusades.

Foundation walls and an underground sewage system are thought to have been built when the building was a sprawling palace for Herod the Great, ruler of Judea.

The Gospel of John describes the trial of Jesus taking place near a gate and uneven pavement, which some archaeologists, including Shimon Gibson, an archaeology professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, believe matches evidence at the site.

‘There is, of course, no inscription stating it happened here, but everything - archaeological, historical and gospel accounts - all falls into place and makes sense,’ he said.

The Reverend David Pileggi, minister of Christ Church located nearby the museum, told the newspaper that the discovery confirms ‘what everyone expected all along, that the trial took place near the Tower of David.’

However, not everyone is convinced. Some experts say that the Gospel’s use of the word ‘praetorium’ - which means general’s tent in military barracks in Latin - suggests the pivotal  trial took place in the Antonia Fortress.

The fortress lies in the north eastern part of the old city, near Temple Mount.

Despite some uncertainty, it's thought that the prison will become a visit on the pilgrim trail.

Eilat Lieber, Director of the Tower of David Museum, says the museum is working with tour guides to explain the history and significance of the remaining ruins.

However, Reverend Pileggi doesn’t think that the prison will become a major site of pilgrimage.

‘What makes a place holy is the fact that people have gone there for hundreds of years, prayed, cried and even celebrated there, so I don’t think there will be changes to the route anytime soon,’ he said.

As well as a Palace in the west of the Old City, King Herod (illustrated) had other properties nearby

As well as a palace in the west of the Old City, Herod had other properties nearby.

He was born around 73BC and was governor of Galilee until 40BC.

The Parthian Empire then conquered Judea, which was under Roman control at the time, and Herod fled to Jerusalem.

He sought refuge in Petra, where his mother was said to have been originally from, and was later appointed King of the Jews by the Roman senate.

With Roman support, he took back the kingdom three years later, and began building a colossal fortress 10 miles (16km) south of Jerusalem a decade after that.

In December, archaeologists unearthed the arched entrance and corridor to the fortress, which was constructed between 23 and 15BC and included a palace and small town on the cone-shaped mound, where some experts say he was buried.

The discovery in the Herodyon National Park was made by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology.

University archaeologists said: ‘The corridor was built as part of Herod's plan to turn Herodium into a massive artificial volcano-shaped hill, a vast and impressive monument designed to commemorate the architect-King.

‘During the course of the excavations, it became evident that the arched corridor was never actually in use, as prior to its completion it became redundant.'

Archaeologists believe the palace was built by slaves and contractors and consisted of four towers, believed to have been where Herod lived.

The site is the highest peak in the Judean desert, stretching 2,450ft (758 metres) above sea level.

According to biblical accounts, when news of Jesus’ arrival reached the king, he was said to have felt threatened and ordered all newborn babies in Bethlehem to be killed.

The Bible portrays him as a tyrant that would stop at nothing to keep his throne.

In Matthew 2:16, the gospel wrote: ‘When he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.’

There were even accounts that the king killed three of his own sons, out of fear of losing his crown. However, few other historical accounts of this massacre have been reported.

Herod died in Jericho in spring 4 BC of an illness dubbed ‘Herod’s Evil’, which is thought to have been a combination of cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, and diabetes.

Some archaeologists believe that his body was buried in a tomb on the site of the fortress.

However, two years ago, experts ruled this location out because the tomb was too small for a ruler known for his decadence and love of ambitious, large scale architectural projects.

King Herod had another fortified palace in Masada - an ancient fortification in the Southern District of Israel situated on top of an isolated rock plateau (akin to a mesa) on the eastern edge of the Judaean Desert, overlooking the Dead Sea.

He built palaces for himself on the mountain, 12 miles east of Arad, and fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE.

The site of Masada was identified in 1842 and extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin.

Due to the remoteness from human habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia.
