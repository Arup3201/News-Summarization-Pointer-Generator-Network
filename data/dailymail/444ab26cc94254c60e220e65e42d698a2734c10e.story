Lionel Messi's legacy at Barcelona looks set to live on long after he has retired after his six-year-old nephew pulled on the famous strip for the first time.

Augustine, the son of Messi's brother Rodrigo, plays for FCB Escola, a Catalan club for children aged between six and 11.

He took part in his first training session this week, watched by his father, according to reports in Spain.

Should Augustine graduate to the Barcelona first team, he will be the third player from FCB Escola to do so.

Marti Riverola made one substitute appearance in the Champions League before he joined Bologna. The 23-year-old is now on loan at Mallorca.

The other is Sergi Samper, a 19 year old midfielder in the mould of Sergio Busquets who made his debut against APOEL in the Champions League last Wednesday.

FCB Escola is run by Xavi Marce and Barcelona have schools across the world, including in Brazil and India.
