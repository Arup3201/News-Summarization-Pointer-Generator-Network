Controversial: Former Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell recruited his ex-colleague within weeks of arriving at the BBC

A former Labour Cabinet Minister hired by the BBC on a £295,000-a-year salary is spending thousands of pounds a week employing an outside consultant he used to work with.

James Purnell, who resigned from Government in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown, joined the Corporation as a director in March.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that within weeks of his arrival he recruited 34-year-old ex-colleague Jean-Paul Petranca.

Mr Purnell and Mr Petranca worked together at Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy,  as recently as January.

Last night the appointment was criticised by Conservative MP Alun Cairns, who said it raised serious questions about the BBC’s employment practices.

Neither the BBC nor Mr Petranca’s company was willing to discuss the nature of his work for Mr Purnell, which is believed to be coming to an end after six months.

But one insider estimated that the BBC has been paying the consultancy firm, which describes itself as the world’s leading adviser on business strategy, about £14,000 a week.

Mr Cairns said: ‘This sort of situation undermines recent commitments made by the BBC to be more transparent. There have already been questions about the manner of James Purnell’s own appointment.

‘For us to find out that he secretly recruited someone from his former company gives the BBC a bad name and raises further doubts about its openness and transparency.’

Battle: Mr Purnell resigned in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown

The news of Mr Petranca’s BBC work comes weeks after it was revealed Mr Purnell had recruited another ex-colleague. Godric Smith, 48, one of Tony Blair’s former spin doctors, is being paid £150,000 a year by the Corporation as a part-time PR adviser. The appointment infuriated Tory MPs as the BBC already has 140 staff in its PR department, with a salary bill of around £5 million.

Mr Smith was hired to help restore the BBC’s reputation after the scandal over Jimmy Savile and a £25 million redundancy bill for senior managers.

Mr Petranca declined to discuss his BBC 
role. ‘I’m afraid I can’t talk about that,’ he said. Boston Consulting 
Group said Oxford graduate Mr Petranca was a ‘principal’ in the 
company’s London office ‘and remains a permanent employee of the firm’.

Transparency: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said the BBC needs to explain why the money is being spent

The BBC was under scrutiny last night after paying a management consultancy firm £5.7 million during the first eight months of this year. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that Deloitte receives an average of £163,000 a week.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of  the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘If the BBC is dishing out these amounts of money, it has to be transparent  as to why.’

The Mail on Sunday obtained the figures under a Freedom of Information Act after  a whistleblower raised concerns.

The source said: ‘The whole finance and operations department is crawling with Deloitte consultants. The bill must be in the tens of millions in recent years.’

A Corporation spokesman said: ‘We are always conscious that we are spending public money, and consultancies are appointed through a fair tendering process.’
