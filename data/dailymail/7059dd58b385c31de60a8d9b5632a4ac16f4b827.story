It takes a brave man to deliberately provoke his pregnant partner, especially in the weeks leading up to the birth.

But Mike Wilson, 33, made it his mission to push the boundaries to find out just how many jokes he could play on his heavily pregnant wife Louise before she snapped.

Using a camera to record her reaction, he tormented his wife and even placed a dog bowl full of water on the floor for her while she was doing exercises.

In the video 'Man vs Pregnant Woman' he labelled her Humpty Dumpty and was seen sucking on  gas and air in the hours before she gave birth to their son Kelan in February.

The father from Basingstoke warned other men about copying his behaviour, saying 'approach with caution' as 'the female generation become angry birds when up the duff'.

'People who know me know I can be a little bit of a wind-up,' said Mr Wilson.

'I wanted to do something funny and do something different so I decided to make the film.

'It just got me thinking, how cool what it be to film what it is like for a guy when their partner is pregnant?

'There was one 'borderline' clip, which was the one where I put the dog's bowl down of the floor for her - I think that was the furthest I could have gone.

'Even though she gets angry in the video, she has watched it back and she finds it hilarious.

'She has told friends 'he always seemed to catch me at my worst point.' But she approves of the video.'

Father from Basingstoke filmed while she was doing exercises and cheekily said: 'That’s getting me horny'

The video called 'Man vs Pregnant Woman' has attracted 46,000 views on YouTube and has divided opinion

He was filmed gently pushing his wife out of the car and said 'hurry up get out of my car'

The freerunner, who is part of the world-famous 3RUN group, is also known as SpiderDad, after turning himself into the Marvel superhero to surprise his terminally ill son.

He decided to make the video, which has attracted 46,000 views on YouTube, as he wanted to play on the fact that most women do not like to hear the words 'how are you feeling?' during pregnancy.

'I started filming when she was seven months pregnant as I thought it was going to be the worst time for her,' he said.

'You only live once, so why not try something different.' 

He is seen in the video showing his wife his cut knee and saying: 'Worst pain ever nothing compares to it.'
