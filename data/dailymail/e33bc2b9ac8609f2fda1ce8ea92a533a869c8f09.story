Forget your classic cutting the cake and catching the bouquet poses, the top wedding photographs of the past year are anything but traditional.

Each year The International Society of Professional Wedding Photographers (ISPWP) holds their annual awards handing out prizes for 20 categories for each season, and 2014's winners all demonstrated something other than a cookie cutter wedding.

From the conventional 'Bride and Groom Portrait' to the vibrant 'All About Light' award - everything is taken into consideration when judging the portraits.

Although you may have never heard of the contest, the competition is stiff with the society receiving more than 20,000 entries this year.    

The process of choosing a winner is a meticulous one. The competition judges convene four times a year picking one winner in each category. By the end of the year, 80 winners have been selected - with artistic value and emotional impact playing a part in the judges' decisions.

The society's members are based all over the world, with group proving assurance for soon-to-be-wed couples that they are hiring a snapper with a good reputation.

Joe Milton, executive director of ISPWP, says that creating an award-winning wedding photograph takes great technical skill as well as a brilliant imagination.

'A great wedding photographer needs to be a great artist and technician to capture the photos on the wedding day.'

Joe added that more importantly the photographer must bear in mind the life-long significance this image will have.  

'But they must also be keenly aware of the importance of the photos being taken.

'These are images that will become part of a family's history so the devotion to both the craft and the client are both very important.'

When choosing the winners of the competition, Joe looks for a variety of themes and effects to best represent the plethora of skills in the business. 

'We want to highlight the best wedding photos in the world, showcasing the full range of photos wedding photographers are expected to take during the course of a wedding.'

The categories cover everything form the very basic dress to moments of emotional impact. Pictures: 1st place, Ceremony, Winter 2013 Raman El Atiaoui, Frankfurt, German
