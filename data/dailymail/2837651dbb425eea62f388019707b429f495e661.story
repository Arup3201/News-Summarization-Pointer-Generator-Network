A man who lives next door to the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, Daniel Snyder, has registered the name Washington Bravehearts, it was reported today.

The trademark states the name is for use for 'entertainment in the nature of football games.'

Aris Mardirossian first registered the trademark and launched 'Washington Brave Hearts LLC' on Oct. 17 according to TMZ.

Denial: 
A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change.

Change it: In an interview with the Associated Press yesterday, President Obama said if he were the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, he would change the name so as not to offend Native Americans

The filing has started rumors spreading that the Washington Redskins may be about to change its name.

The wording used on the filing documents is similar to that used for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change.

“There is no connection between the Washington Redskins and the trademark application,” said a team spokesman. “Dan Snyder does not know the man named in the story.”

However, this appeared to be untrue.

Rumors: Owner Daniel Snyder created a company called Washington Brave Hearts, LLC

Mr Snyder and Mr Mardirossian worked together in a lawsuit back in 2005 
against the National Park Service in a fight to chop down trees in front
of their homes, in a request that was denied.

Simply because a 
trademark has been established doesn't necessarily mean the Redskins are
about to change their name, however the timing is interesting given the
recent controversy surrounding the racial aspect of the “Redskins” 
name.

Earlier this month President Barack Obama weighed in on the
debate saying that if he owned the Washington Redskins, he would 'think
about changing' the team name.

Chinese whispers: Maybe this is all smoke and no fire however SNyder's neighbor Mardirossian registered the domain WashingtonBravehearts.com on October 18.

Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press, he said team names like the Redskins offend 'a sizable group of people.'

He said that while fans get attached to the nicknames, nostalgia may not be a good enough reason to keep them in place.

'I don't want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here. They love their team and rightly so,' he said.

But
the president appeared to come down on the side of those who have 
sharply criticized the football team's name, noting that Indians 'feel 
pretty strongly' about mascots and team names that depict negative 
stereotypes about their heritage.

Other professional sports teams have 
Indian nicknames, including football's Kansas City Chiefs and baseball's
Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians.

Numerous colleges and universities have changed names that reference Native Americans.

St. John's changed its mascot
from the Redmen to the Red Storm, Marquette is now the Golden Eagles 
instead of the Warriors and Stanford switched from the Indians to the 
Cardinal.

The
Redskins' nickname has attracted a fresh round of controversy in recent
months, with local leaders in Washington calling for a name change and 
some media outlets refraining from using the name.

Protest: Those against the mascot and team 
name plan protested in 
Washington, D.C. earlier this month. Above, the team's mascot in 1995

The name is the subject of a 
long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to
block the team from having federal trademark protection.

Congressional lawmakers have introduced a bill seeking the same goal, though it appears unlikely to pass.

Team
owner Dan Snyder has vowed to never abandon the name. But NFL 
Commissioner Roger Goodell said last month that the league should pay 
attention to those offended by the nickname.

Time for change? Snyder watches from the sidelines before a game against Detroit on September 22. Several other sports teams have changed their names in the past so as not to offend Native Americans

Despite the controversy, an AP-GfK poll conducted in April showed that nationally, 'Redskins' still enjoys wide support.

Nearly
4 in 5 Americans don't think the team should change its name, the 
survey found. Only 11 percent think it should be changed, while 8 
percent weren't sure and 2 percent didn't answer

Keep it: According to a poll conducted by the AP and GfK, four out of five Americans think the team should keep their name. Chief Zee, a longtime Redskins mascot is pictured above before a Minnesota Vikings game last year
