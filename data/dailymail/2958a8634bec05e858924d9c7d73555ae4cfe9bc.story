A professional wrestler in Iowa has come up with an enticing proposition for sponsors - the chance to have their logo inked permanently on his back.

Levi McDaniel came up with the idea to sell advertising space on his back as a way to raise money for a cancer charity in memory of his aunt who died this month.

After advertising for sponsors on eBay, a Des Moines tattoo and piercing parlor took him up on the deal and offered to do the tattoo for free.

Opening bid: Lucky Gal tattoo parlor is the first company to have their logo inked on to McDaniel's back

'It just seemed like he had a big heart,
since he was going to give the money away to family,'  Chris 
Pruisner, of the Lucky Gal parlor, told the Des Moines Register.

McDaniel, 23, said he got the idea for selling advertising space on his body from Rock 'n' Roll Wrestling founder Buck Zumhofe.

After seeing McDaniel's extensive tattoos, Zumhofe suggested that he used future ones to attract sponsors.

McDaniel said he wasn't sure if Zumhofe was joking but when he thought about the size of the crowds he competes in front of he decided to give it a go.

The wrestler listed his offer on eBay, saying 'let me be your mascot' and telling prospective sponsors their logo would have plenty of exposure thanks to his more than 22,000 Twitter followers and a career performing in front of huge crowds.

When tattooist Pruisner heard about the auction he loved the idea and decided it would be better if his logo went on McDaniel rather than something else.

'Someone said something [in the article]
about him ending up with something like the Gerber Baby on his back. I 
decided it would be better if I did it than someone else,' he said.

After contacting McDaniel in private, he offered to pay $1,000 and do the tattoo for free - an offer the wrestler was more than happy to accept. 

Todd Countryman, one of 3XWrestling's owners, said McDaniel's tattoos added to his presence in the ring.

'It gives Levi an extra gimmick and 
draws more attention to him. It could make whatever company decides to 
advertise on him seem more unique and draw a little more attention to 
him,' he told USA Today.

McDaniel said his new tattoo was awesome, and added: 'Chris did a great job; he’s a cool guy with a cool shop. I 
really like the tattoo, so I’m happy. It was all worth it.'

He donated 75 per cent of the sponsorship money to the family of his aunt, Linda, and the remainder to a cancer charity in memory of her.

Since having the logo inked on his back, McDaniel has been approached by other companies also wanting to advertise on the wrestler's body.
