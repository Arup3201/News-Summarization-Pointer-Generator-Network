A giant bird of prey big enough to carry off small dogs in its talons is on the loose after getting blown off track in windy weather.

Steller's sea eagle Nikita, which has a 8ft wingspan, went missing when it took to the air for an exercise session in blustery conditions in North Yorkshire on Saturday.

Police officers have warned people to keep their pets indoors until it has been found.

Trainer Chris O'Donnell, who thinks ten-year-old Nikita is probably only a few miles away from her home at the Hawk Experience in Brackenbottom, North Yorkshire, said: 'She's a very tame bird, you could walk up to her and almost pet her if you wanted to.

'She is a very strong bird but she's so gentle and relaxed. In winter we are a lot quieter and so we let her fly. She's normally only gone for a few hours at a time but we've not seen Nikita since Saturday now.

'I think the windy weather has probably blown her off track. Letting her have a few hours of freedom is very important for her training but it's not normal for her to be gone so long.

'She's a home bird and I imagine she'll be sitting somewhere waiting for me to come and pick her up.

'The weather doesn't help either. It's rained a lot and so she's more likely to be taking shelter rather than flying, which means she'll be harder to spot.

'She'll be sitting there watching the world go by wishing she was back home.'

Mr O'Donnell, who has trained Nikita since she was just two years old, said there have been two reported sightings since she went missing.

'Two people have called me claiming they've seen her in York but I don't think they'll be her,' he said.

'The public can get a little excited over these things. They said they were fleeting glances so I think it's more likely that they were herons.

'You'd know if you saw Nikita because she is so huge.'

The majestic predators, which are native to east Russia, can go up to two weeks without food so Mr O'Donnell said he isn't worried.

'She'll be very fit and healthy wherever she and she won't need food for weeks,' he added. 'I just want to get her home.

'She's not fitted with a transmitter because she could just rip it off with her beak in seconds so we can't track her.

'She's used to eating frozen pigeons and rabbits so biting into a transmitter would be a piece of cake.'

North Yorkshire Police has asked anyone who spots the bird to call 101.

'If this turns up on your bird table you're going to call the police,' Mr O'Donnell added.
