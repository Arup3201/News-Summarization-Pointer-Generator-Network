This is the moment a group of thrill-seeking skydivers were given the unforgettable opportunity to jump from the bomb bay doors of a military aeroplane.

Arranged by Chicagoland Skydiving Center, the special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois.

Exiting the aircraft from 5,000ft, the skydivers each made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation – the non-profit organisation that operates the plane – in order to take part in the jump.

Filmed on GoPro cameras attached to helmets, the video begins with the skydivers boarding the heavy bomber aircraft at an airport in Rockford, Illinois.

Developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Corps, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber aircraft.

The prototype B-17 was designed and built at Boeing’s own expense by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and Edward Curtis Wells.

Boeing chief test-pilot Leslie Tower was at the controls of the Model 299 when it made its maiden flight on July 28, 1935.

The name Flying Fortress was used to describe the aircraft because the Model 299 included multiple machine gun installations.

The B-17 served numerous USAAF units in combat throughout World War II and was even used by the RAF in non-bomber roles.

The B-17 Flying Fortress has become a symbol of power and the America Air Force.

Capturing the closed bay doors from the inside of the plane, the video switches to show the aircraft's large propellers starting up before the B-17 leaves the runway.

In the air, one of the skydivers checks out the numerous guns attached to the aircraft as well as the two pilots driving it from the cockpit.

Before long the B-17 is cruising at around 5,000ft and the bay doors can be seen opening via a camera mounted to the bottom on the plane.

Inside the skydivers stand over the opening floor and hold on to the railings on either side as Northern Illinois comes into view below.

Waiting for the right moment, the skydivers then begin dropping from the plane at different times – as the camera underneath picks up their rapid exits.

The video concludes with footage recorded from a GoPro, which shows the plane moving further away as the skydiver gets closer to the ground.

Mike Wood, Chief Operations Officer at Chicagoland Skydiving Center and one of the jumpers in the video, spoke enthusiastically about the experience.

He told Newsflare: ‘I've been skydiving for more than 30 years and a pilot for more than 20, and the B-17 jump was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.

‘As a pilot and a jumper, it's a privilege to have had a ride in this plane. 

'Watching the bomb bay doors open below my feet was a sight I will never forget.’

The Chicagoland Skydiving Center conduct numerous skydives every year with specialty aircraft being brought to its drop zone in Illinois.

The Collings Foundation raises money to cover maintenance costs by bringing war planes to air shows across the US.
