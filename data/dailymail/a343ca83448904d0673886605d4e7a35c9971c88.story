A class of Spanish schoolchildren got a surprise when they arrived for lessons only to find King Felipe and Queen Letizia waiting for them instead.

The Spanish royal couple were visiting the Ben-Cho-Shey Primary Education Center in Pereiro de Aguiar in Ourense when they joined the children for lessons.

Before the hard business of learning got underway, the royals spent a few happy moments getting to know the pupils in the playground before following them into class.

Are you my teacher? The school children are met by King Felipe and Queen Letizia outside their school

Wow! Some of the children looked a little surprised to find the royal couple in their playground as they arrived

There, 
King Felipe, 46, found himself centre of attention as he joined a table of 
children doing jigsaw puzzles, while Letizia enjoyed a chat with another
 little girl.

Dressed
 in an elegant floral jacket, cream shirt and tailored black trousers, 
she looked every inch the style icon - even managing to effortlessly 
navigate the corridors in a pair of sky-high peep-toes.

The
 look was a far cry from the one she adopted to take her own daughters 
to school last week, where she opted for a simple grey t-shirt and 
jeans.

The two girls, Leonor, eight, and Sofia, seven, 
both go to the same school, Santa Maria de los Rosales in Madrid, which 
their father also attended as a boy.

Lessons from the king: Felipe appeared to be enjoying himself as he helped some of the children with a jigsaw

So that's what you do: Letizia passes on her words of jigsaw-building wisdom to one delighted little girl

Ta dah! The advice seems to work as the little girl, named Victoria, manages to complete her puzzle

Felipe, for his part, was dapper in a pinstripe suit and appeared to be enjoying himself as he chatted to the children and teachers.

The
 visit came a day after Letizia celebrated her 42nd birthday with an 
appearance at a journalism awards ceremony and lunch in Madrid.

There,
 dressed in a chic rose-print dress and a tailored cream jacket, the 
royal made a speech before helping to hand out awards.

The appearance in Madrid came hot on the heels of a frenetic week, which included a 
visit from the president and first lady of Panama and several charity 
meetings.

The
 rest of the month is also set to be a busy one for Letizia and her 
husband courtesy of a busy schedule of appointments at home, before a 
visit to New York at the end of September where Felipe will address the 
UN General Assembly.

Looking good: Letizia was pretty in her print jacket while Felipe opted for pinstripes and a salt and pepper beard

All together now! The royals posed for a photo with all the children and teachers before leaving the school

Stylish: Letizia wore a stylish lilac rose print dress and a chic cream jacket for yesterday's appearance

Bare-faced beauty: Queen Letizia went make-up free for school run with Infanta Sofia (pictured) last week

Back to school: The two little princesses were smart in their navy blazers and carried bright red backpacks

Schedule: The couple have a busy new term of their own, with a visit to New York later this month
