Wales manager Chris Coleman has backed his first-choice left-back Ben Davies to oust Danny Rose from the Tottenham starting line-up and make the position his own at White Hart Lane.

Davies, who became Mauricio Pochettino's first signing as manager of Spurs, has been playing second fiddle to Rose since his  arrival in north London, and is yet to start a game for his new side.

Coleman, though, believes that it won't be long before the tables are turned and Davies makes the starting eleven.

'I think Ben will end up being their first choice. It is not always easy when you have a big move. Ben is a Swansea boy and we don't tend to be great travellers when we are young.

'But he is a great player and a great lad, he will settle in there.'

The move came about as part of a swap deal between the two clubs. Michel Vorm and Ben Davies joined Spurs, while midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson headed for south Wales alongside a £3.5m payment to Swansea.

Since his arrival on 23 July, Pochettino has opted to stick with the left-back he inherited when he joined the club, and Davies has not made enough of an impact to break through.

Coach: Coleman's side begin their qualifying campaign in Group B on Tuesday

The 21-year-old Welshman has impressed Coleman on international duty though, and has nailed down a starting position and held off the competition of Neil Taylor for his starting place.

Coleman is confident that his defender will follow the same path at club level as he has at international.

'Danny Rose has not done anything wrong, but all players have a bad day, and when he does and Ben gets his chance we know he is good enough.'

Coleman was speaking at a press conference ahead of Wales opening Euro 2016 Group B qualifier against Andorra on Tuesday.
