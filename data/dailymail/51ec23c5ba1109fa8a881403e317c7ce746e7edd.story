A sports reporter captured the moment a baseball flew narrowly past her head in this self-taken photograph at the home of the Boston Red Sox.

Kelly Nash had a lucky escape as the home run whizzed by while she took the image high up in the stands during batting practice at Fenway Park stadium.

She revealed she had been warned of stray balls by her producer as she stood in the left field section of the ground - but only noticed the near miss when she tried to text the picture to others.

'Producer Art Dryce had called out ‘heads up!’ a few times while I was taking pictures around the left field section,' USA Today reported her as saying.

'But none of those balls actually fell close to me, so I took my chances turning my back on batting practice for a picture.'

Ms Nash, who works for Sun Sports, said her whole family is from Massachusetts, and that they would all be excited to see her working at Fenway Park.

She later revealed she had a DVD copy of Angels in the Outfield in her bag at the time of the near miss.
