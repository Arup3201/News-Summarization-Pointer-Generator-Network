A South Carolina dog that had its head trapped in an air conditioning duct pipe for up to a week was finally freed yesterday.

The male stray dog, named Piper by animal rescuers, was caught by Oconee County animal officials with traps and tranquilizer guns after days of trying to catch the pooch.

Piper was unable to eat or drink while having the tube stuck over its entire head but is now doing well in recovery.

Stranded: This feral dog was first spotted Monday running around Oconee County, South Carolina, with his head lodged firmly inside a metal duct pipe

The dog is undergoing an evaluation by a veterinarian today and will then be released to the owner of the property, Charles Williams, where Piper was first seen, WYFF reported.

Despite being a stray dog, Charles Williams has been friendly with Piper for around a year.

The dog will also be neutered while in veterinarian care and receive shots.

Upstate
 Animal Rescue spokesman Kelly Blair said last week that the dog 
couldn't eat or drink with the metal tube clamped tightly around his 
head.

According to Blair, 
the pup refused to let anyone get near to help, so she hoped someone 
who is trained to use a tranquilizer gun would come to his aide.

Blair said people frequently abandon their pets with no food or water in the area where the dog was found.

The black-and-white pooch was discovered last Monday in Oconee County, stuck in the pipe which may have occurred while Piper was chasing a small critter.

Being a feral animal, the pooch did not allow anyone to come near him.

Ruff life: The pooch likely was abandoned as a puppy and has been living on the streets for a year, relying on the kindness of neighbors

Neighbor Charles Williams told the station Fox Carolina that volunteer rescuers had come out to try and catch the dog, but he bolted and went into hiding.

The dog has been living on the streets
 for a year. On Upstate Animal Rescue Foundation's Facebook page, Kelly 
Blair wrote that local residents have been feeding the animal.

On Friday, animal control officials set up a large trap in hopes of capturing the poor, frightened animal, but it wasn't until Monday that Piper was caught.

Upstate Animal Rescue officials said this was a first for the organization, which has been around for 30 years. The group needed donations to help with the pup's medical bills.
