A mug of hot chocolate before bed is not usually seen as a prelude to an evening of whirlwind passion.

That may be about to change, though, with the introduction  of a ‘turbo-charged’ type of chocolate said to have Viagra-like properties.

The world’s largest chocolate-maker has developed a technique to concentrate levels of key plant chemicals called flavanols.

These are found in cocoa beans but are normally stripped out in the chocolate-making process.

Swiss-based chocolate giant Barry Callebaut is said to be just weeks away from getting the go-ahead from the EU to claim the ‘turbo-charged’ chocolate boosts health by increasing blood flow.

Industry experts say it will then be only a matter of time before it is incorporated into novelty chocolates, pastes and drinks that, like Viagra, use a rush of blood to stop a man from being a flop in the bedroom.

The flood of feel-good hormones to the 
brain would be an added bonus, the International Chocolate Industry 
Network event heard this week.

Angus Kennedy, of trade magazine Kennedy’s Confection, said: ‘If it is cleared for use, this could see men swap chemical-packed blue pills for a turbo-charged hot chocolate.

‘It’s an all-natural ingredient which could give men the legendary staying power of some of the world’s greatest lovers. I’ve been in the business for 35 years and this is probably one of the most exciting things I’ve seen.’

Men who buy the ‘natural Viagra’ will be in good company. Aztec ruler Montezuma is said to have downed 50 cups of a chocolate drink before visiting his harem. Venetian arch-seducer Casanova also partook of chocolate.

Although most people have never heard of it, one in five chunks of chocolate that pass your lips is likely to have been made by Barry Callebaut. 

The firm helps supply many household names including Cadbury’s, as well as caterers and chefs, and has British factories in Chester, Banbury and St Helens.

Recent research from trends analysis firm Mintel reveals men are catching up with women when it comes to munching the sweet treat, as 87 per cent of men now eat chocolate, compared with 91 per cent of women.

Cocoa and chocolate have historically been said to increase sexual desire and improve sexual pleasure.

Ancient
South American civilisations prized the beans in cocoa pods so much for
their medicinal and aphrodisiacal properties, they even used them as 
currency.

This is because 
cocoa beans contain high levels of flavanols and an amino acid called 
phenylalamine, which increase the levels of endorphins and serotonin in 
the brain. 

These chemicals
occur naturally and are released by the brain into the nervous system 
during happy situations and feelings of love, passion and lust. 

This
causes a rapid mood change, a rise in blood pressure, an increase in  
heart rate, and induces those feelings of well-being that are usually 
associated with being in love.

Chocolate
is also known to give an instant energy boost and increase stamina, 
which explains why it has a reputation as an aphrodisiac.
