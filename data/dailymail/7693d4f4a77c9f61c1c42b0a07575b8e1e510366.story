Ajax were gifted victory at Go Ahead Eagles in the Eredivisie on Sunday after their on-loan goalkeeper, Mickey van der Hart, assisted a bizarre own goal for the home side.  

With the score locked at 1-1, Van der Hart completely missed his kick when receiving a back pass from Wesley Verhoek and allowed the ball to roll into his empty net. 

It was a deeply embarrassing moment for the young stopper against his parent club and cost his current side a precious point as they hover precariously just one place and three points above the relegation zone.

 Ajax have won the last four Eredivisie league titles, but this year's defence is looking a little shaky

Ajax, meanwhile are second in the table with 46 points from 22 games, but are 12 off the pace of league leaders PSV Eindhoven. 

The Amsterdam club had broken the deadlock against The Eagles in the 24th miute with Ricardo Kishna powering down the flank before pulling the ball back to Anwar El Ghazi, who prodded home from close range.

Go Ahead leveled midway through the second-half when Sjoerd Overgoor let rip with a shot from 25 yards that flew into the top corner.

But just as a draw was looking likely, Van der Hart's error proved costly for the hosts.  

The gaffe has already become a viral sensation and there are plenty of conspiracy theories doing the rounds on internet message boards as to how convenient the mistake seems for Frank de Boer's side.

The theories, however, are purely speculative, and it seems more likely that this was simply another freakish moment in football that those involved will want to forget, but fans will always remember.

In 2006, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson experienced a similar fate to Van der Haart, missing his kick from Gary Neville's back pass as The Three Lions slumped to a 2-0 defeat against Croatia.  

Ajax have won the previous four Dutch titles, but this year's defence is looking a little frail with PSV so far out in front. 

De Boer has been widely linked with an exit from the club at the end of the season, with Premier League side Newcastle United being mooted as a potential destination.
