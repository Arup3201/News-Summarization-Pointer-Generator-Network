A small town is reeling following two recent suicides.

Ado Halkic, 15, and Mike Steve, 18, were both found hanged in their homes in Burlington, New Jersey just four days apart.

Halkic took his life on January 1, and Steve took his on January 5 - and no one seems to know why.

Halkic's father Adam told NBC 10 that 'the two were longtime friends who trained together at the JBM Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy in Edgewater Park for about eight years.'

He said that on January 1 his son asked him to order chicken wings, and a short time later he found him dead.

'It has been shocking news for us that two of our students, one who was 15 and another who was 18, have committed suicide,' said JBM Gym Director Victor Lopez.

Burlington Township High School, where both boys were students, released a statement saying; 'Needless to say, the past few days have been painful for our entire community. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been touched by the sudden death of two of our high school students.'

They then added; 'It is in times like these that we need to come together as a community to support each other.' 

Facebook: Steve posted a message just days after Halkic'd death that said 'see you soon'

In a message posted to his Facebook that has since been taken down, Steve wrote following Halkic's death; 'It's a big pleasure still calling him my dearest and closest friend.'

He then added; 'I love u buddy I will see you soon!!!' 

This after he posted photos on his page of his friend. 

George also gave a speech at school in Halkic's memory during an impromptu memorial service, and hours later decided to take his own life.

Services for Halkic were held earlier this week, while services for Steve will be held Friday.
