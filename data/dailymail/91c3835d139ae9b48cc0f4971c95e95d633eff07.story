British cycling ace Mark Cavendish had to stop and ask two schoolboys for directions after he got lost on his bike while practising for the upcoming Tour de France.

The Green Jersey winner, who has won 25 Tour stages, was given directions by the youngsters after he stopped in a bus shelter after getting lost in Middleham, North Yorkshire.

Due to lack of GPS signal, he was struggling to find the right road to take in the area which forms part of the route for the first stage of this year's race, known as the Grand Depart.

The Omega Pharma-Quick Step rider, 29, spent two days riding through Yorkshire last week on a reconnaissance run for the Tour which starts on July 5.

He is said to be desperate to win the first stage because it ends with a sprint finish in his mother's hometown of Harrogate.

Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said the cycling sprinter was ‘impressed with the route’.

He said: ‘He couldn't get a GPS signal in Leyburn, I told him that's an occupational hazard, but these schoolboys knew the route inside out and gave him directions.

‘Only then did they realise it was Mark Cavendish. He told them that he was going to win stage one.

‘He had a wonderful time, he was very impressed with the route and the enthusiasm of everyone he met.

‘It gives the whole team a huge boost to know someone like Mark is so enthusiastic and so determined. He said everyone in cycling is talking about the Tour and how special it will be.’

Cavendish appeared to enjoy his time spent in Yorkshire and even took to his Twitter profile to inform his 800,000 followers about his jaunt.

On Friday, he posted a picture from his journey near to the Yorkshire Dales with the caption: 'Any guesses as to where I was taking this photo yesterday?'

And on Saturday, he followed it up with a tweet which read: 'Couple of days done looking at the 1st 2 stages of @letouryorkshire @letour & I'm tired! Beautiful, but very hard start to a 3 week race.'

He is now expected to continue training for this year's 21-stage Tour which will see some of the world's top cyclists battle it out for the coveted yellow, green, polka dot and white jerseys.
