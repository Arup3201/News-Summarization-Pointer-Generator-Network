A judge has agreed to postpone the punishment of Ashley Tonks (above), 19, who stole cash from Help for Heroes - so the yob can go on holiday to Ibiza

A judge has agreed to postpone the punishment of a thief who stole cash from Help for Heroes - so the yob can go on holiday to Ibiza.

Ashley Tonks, 19, collected donations for the charity at an Asda supermarket fundraiser but pocketed the cash.

Magistrates sentenced him to 250 hours of unpaid work but he was unable to complete the final 100 hours after injuring himself in a motorcycle crash.

His punishment was replaced with an extended curfew order which would have encroached onto two sunshine holidays which Tonks had already booked.

But the lout persuaded District Judge Martin Brown at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court to let him enjoy a week-long break in Britain and eight days in Ibiza before he starts his curfew.

Unrepentant Tonks, from Tuffley, Gloucester, claimed the curfew 'means nothing to me'.

He said: 'I'm not a bad person, I made a mistake and I took a hit for it.

'I'm going on holiday on Saturday and then going away with the missus. If I was a bad person, surely they wouldn't have done that.'

Tonks stole an undisclosed sum of cash following the fundraiser in May 2012.

He was originally sentenced to 250 hours' work and ordered to pay £250 compensation and given a six-week curfew banning him from going out between 7pm and 7am.

Tonks fully complied with the order, working at the Dean Forest Railway tourist attraction, until he was signed off sick on February 11 after the motorbike accident.

The thief said District Judge Brown allowed him to delay the start of the new curfew until after his holiday because he had complied with his original sentence.

He begins a week-long holiday in the UK this Saturday, returning home for three days, before jetting off to Ibiza on August 7 for eight days in the sun.

His new six-week curfew will begin the day after he returns and last until September 27, and he will not be allowed out between 8pm and 6am.

Tonks said his punishment has changed him and he is 'moving on'

Tonks said his punishment has changed him and he is 'moving on'.

He said: 'I have been moving on with my job and I thought I was doing the right thing.

'I sat there on the day of Lee Rigby's funeral [the fusilier who was hacked to death on a London street in May, and had been wearing a Help for Heroes top] and I stopped for two minutes in silence. I pulled over into a layby.

'I paid back £365 costs - £250 compensation and the rest was court costs. I made a mistake and it has cost me a lot of money, and my family a lot of problems.

'I didn't want a curfew but at the end of the day, it means nothing to me.'

Help for Heroes declined to comment, but Carol Bratty, from Hardwicke Royal British Legion, in nearby Gloucester, slammed the judge's decision.

'He [Tonks] should spend time at a rehabilitation centre,' she said

'He will get a wake-up call as he meets soldiers suffering from combat stress.'
