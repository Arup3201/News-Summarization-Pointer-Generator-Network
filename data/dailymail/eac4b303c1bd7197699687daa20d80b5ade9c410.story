'Last night was truly magical!!! I am the luckiest girl in the world!' the reality star said. 'I get to marry my best friend!'

The rapper hired out the AT&T Park in San Francisco to propose to the mother of his child in front of friends and family.

Kanye, who is in the midst of a world tour, popped the question to Kim after serenading her with a 50 piece orchestra.

The band struck up the romantic ballad 
Young And Beautiful from film The Great Gatsby by songstress Lana Del 
Rey, followed by his own hit with Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo, Knock You Down.

According to RadarOnline, he may have chosen
the venue because it's where his idol Barry Bonds hit his 
record-breaking 756th homerun. Kanye professed his admiration for the 
baseball legend in the past, naming a song after him in 2007.

After Kim said yes, Kanye slipped a 15 carat diamond ring onto her finger and fireworks exploded in the sky as the rest of her family ran out of the dugouts.

Unlike Kanye, Kim's second husband Kris Humphries opted for a more low-key proposal.Â 

The athlete asked Kim by writing 'will you marry me' in rose petals on her bed inside her $4.8million Beverly Hills home in May, 2011.

After Kim accepted, the couple celebrated with the Kardashian-Jenner clan during a family dinner.

However, the moment wasn't entirely private, the whole time the cameras were rolling for the family's hit reality TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

The pair married in August, 2011, but the union was short lived.

After 72 days of marriage, Kim filed for divorce from Kris, citing irreconcilable differences as the cause of the split.

'I didn't expect this at all. I was in such shock. I never thought it would happen at home, and I never thought now,' Kim told People magazine in May 2011. 'Kris really didn't want a big celebration, but he had jokingly told my mom he'd be fine if there were mini-horses there.'Later that night at the party, my mom brought out two mini-horses, covered in glitter, for us! It was hysterical!' she added.Kim's tweet after news broke of the engagement: 'Couldn't be happier'.
