A young woman chef at a leading restaurant was ‘groped’ and teased about her breasts by the all-male kitchen staff, an employment tribunal heard yesterday.

Chloe Maisey, 19, claims she was ogled every day as she changed into her uniform at the restaurant of celebrity chef Stephen Terry, who was best man at Gordon Ramsay’s wedding.

She also claims staff rubbed fish in her face, threw a mouse at her across the kitchen, shut her in a freezer and sprayed hot water over her.

‘I felt like they targeted me because I was the only girl in the kitchen,’ she said.

Mr Terry, 47, a regular on TV shows such as the BBC’s Saturday Kitchen, denies sex discrimination at his Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, which is regularly named the best in Wales.

Miss Maisey, who is pregnant, said she had been delighted to be made a trainee pastry chef for Mr Terry, who trained under Marco Pierre White and was awarded a Michelin star at the age of 25.

But she claimed it turned into a nightmare of sexual discrimination.

‘There were no female changing rooms, so I was forced to change in front of the male chefs every day,’ she said.

‘I would turn around and they would all be watching me. They stared at me constantly and made comments about my body. They called me fat and made comments about my boobs.’

She described how she was groped by saying: ‘A male colleague slapped my bum.’

The teenager said her male colleagues ‘intimidated’ her. ‘They told me I would get a job flipping burgers at McDonald’s if I did not do as they said.’

The chefs were referred to during the hearing only by their nicknames. None of the nicknames referred to Mr Terry.

Miss Maisey, of Pontyclun, South Wales, also claimed male staff had poured salt and pepper into her hair and put earwigs into a saucepan to scare her.

Telling how one colleague had shut her inside the freezer, she said: ‘He shut the lid on me and I could not get out. I was really scared and upset. I was so shocked he had done it to me.’

She claims she was deliberately burned on the arm with a hot tray and squirted with hot water from a hose used to clean the oven. ‘The water burned my back through my chef’s whites. It felt like my back was on fire. When I fell over, everyone laughed.’

Miss Maisey told the Cardiff tribunal: ‘There were no other female members of staff in the kitchen that I could turn to for help.’ Asked why she did not report the incidents to Mr Terry, she replied: ‘It was the first job I had been in and I thought that was what happened.

‘I did not know who to go to or who to tell. I was ashamed of what was happening to me and I did not want to tell anyone.’

She quit last August after three months. Her mother Pauline said her daughter called her after her last shift, adding: ‘She was distraught. It took me a long time to calm her down. She was hysterical.’

'Distraught': Ms Maisey's mother said that her 
daughter (above), who resigned from the position at The Hardwick last 
August, said that on one occasion she was hysterical after returning 
from work

Mrs Maisey said Mr Terry did not deal adequately with her complaints about her daughter’s colleagues.

Mr Terry, who denies 21 allegations of sexual discrimination, said many of the alleged incidents were ‘banter’ among colleagues in a high-pressure kitchen.

He added: ‘If she was so distressed about all these incidents then she could have told me about just one of them. But at no point ever did she tell me about any of these alleged incidents.’

The first he heard of any sexual discrimination was when Miss Maisey’s mother rang him. He said he asked her to put the allegations in writing but she never did.

He said there had been more than 100 female employees at the Hardwick ‘and this is something completely new to us’.

The tribunal continues.
