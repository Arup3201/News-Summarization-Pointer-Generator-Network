Louis van Gaal's horrendous start as Manchester United manager got even worse on Tuesday night as his side were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by MK Dons.

In one of the most humiliating nights in the club’s history, United were thrashed at Stadium mk, with Will Grigg and Benik Afobe both scoring twice to seal a stunning victory for the League One team.

But Van Gaal asked supporters for more time, saying: ‘Fans have to believe in our philosophy, we are building a team which we cannot make in one month or even one year. It’s very disappointing but I hope they maintain their confidence in our club.

‘You have to analyse the problem and I’ve done that.

‘We have nine injuries and a very young team. I have seen them trying to do their best so you cannot expect more. We made big errors and you can’t make these errors as it’s tough to come back. We didn’t have the luck to score but at least we have created a lot of chances.’

The night started in a buoyant mood for the travelling fans after United sealed a British record £59.7million deal for Angel di Maria. But United collapsed in the second-round tie despite having seven internationals in their side and finishing 47 places higher than Karl Robinson’s team last season.

Van Gaal sought to play down the drubbing, which saw basic defensive errors lead to the first three goals they conceded.

He said: ‘I have no regrets on the team selection. Don’t forget we have a young team and nine injuries and we have to play for the second time within 48 hours. I couldn’t play with the squad I used on Sundays so I had to look at the second team and the youth team.

‘Of course I am disappointed but I can analyse this. Am I shocked? No, I am not shocked because I know what can happen and I know MK Dons played very well, very aggressively and they had a bit of luck also with the goals.’

United fans were outraged that Van Gaal casually signed autographs after the game, but the Dutchman again pleaded with them to have faith in his rebuilding project.

Poor: Manchester United have started the season poorly, with two defeats and a draw

He said: ‘When you start as a manager in the Premier League with a home loss and then a draw and after that you lose a cup match then it is very disappointing. It’s very difficult for the fans to believe in my philosophy. But they have to do that because I am here to build up a new team and that takes time.

‘I haven’t just been saying that this week, but last week and even when we were winning everything in the United States on our pre-season tour.’

While United were utterly dejected, the Dons were in raptures.

Robinson said: ‘I’m a bit shocked to be walking off and seeing the scoreline. It’s ridiculous, it’s something that dreams are made of for these players. We work hard and you’ve seen a youthful energy in the team.

‘They’ve got the superstars in the side and they’re the ones that are in the public eye on a daily basis, an hourly basis to an extent, we’re not.’
