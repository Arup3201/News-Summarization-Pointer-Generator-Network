The childhood home of George Harrison, where The Beatles began to take shape as the pop sensation that would conquer the world, has been put up for sale.

The humble three-bed terrace in Liverpool was home to Harrison and his family in the 1950s and was where he and his friends Paul McCartney and John Lennon held their first band rehearsals.

And though the house has been formally valued at just £75,000, the owners hope the part it played in the Beatles legacy will boost its value significantly.

Harrison lived at the property with his parents until the early 1960s, by which point the band were well on their way to international super-stardom.

The former council house was bought from Liverpool City Council by Matthew and Edna Kermode in 1983.

Mr Kermode continued to live in the house until his death, which triggered the home being passed to his daughter, Linda, who is selling it.

Last year John Lennon’s unassuming childhood home in Liverpool was snapped up at auction by a Beatles fan for £480,000 - three times the initial £150,000 estimate.

Beatlemania: While Harrison was living at the house The Beatles came into their own - and in 1963, a year after the Harrisons moved out - the band had their first number one album

Harrison was only six years old when in 1950 his parents Harold and Louise moved to the modest council house, in the Speke district of Liverpool, close to where Paul McCartney lived with his parents.

Some years later the two youngsters met while waiting for a school bus and McCartney convinced Harrison, who had become obsessed with guitars, to join a band he had started with another friend - John Lennon.

The Harrison family lived at the terraced house until 1962 when they moved to Macket’s Lane in the Hunt’s Cross neighbourhood of Liverpool.

By that point the Beatles were on the road to worldwide fame having just released their first single, Love Me Do. Consequently, Mr and Mrs Harrison were constantly besieged by Beatles fans.

Glory days: Mr and Mrs Harrison had to fend off hundreds of fans who would set up camp outside their home

Since then the house has been lived in by several owners, the latest of which died recently and it passed down to relatives.

They have now decided to auction the property following the huge success of the sale of Lennon’s first house at 9 Newcastle Road.

The auction will be conducted by Countrywide property auctioneers but the date of the sale has not yet been revealed.

Steven Green, from estate agents Homes Bought Fast which is selling the house, said: 'We had a call from a lady who had inherited a three-bed terrace in Liverpool from her father who had recently passed away.

'There was nothing remarkable about it whatsoever, until she revealed that it was where George Harrison grew up.

Yellow submarine not included: Pictured is the bathroom of the home. The Harrison family stayed in the property until 1962, by which time the Beatles' popularity was well-established

Bed-in: The current owners will be hoping that that the house will suffer a similar Beatles boost to John Lennon's old house, which more than tripled its auction estimate . Pictured is one of the bedrooms

Where the heart is: A Liverpudlian couple bought the home from the council in the 1980s, but later died. Their daughter is now selling the property

'We did a lot of research into the property and soon established that it was indeed where George had spent his years before joining the Beatles.

'The house is just a typical terrace but inside it has been modernised and it could easily be lived in or rented out.

'We are now in the process of arranging an auction for the house.

'It is hard to know what a house of this significance is worth. We will not be publishing a guide price until much closer to the auction, which should take place in several weeks’ time.

'John Lennon’s childhood home sold at auction last year for £480,000 against an estimate of £150,000 so we are hoping that a similar thing happens with this property.

'The vendor is being realistic about the sale - he realises it could go for a life-changing sum of money but is happy to see what happens.

'You can never underestimate the popularity of the Beatles.'

Outside: The former council property has an indelible link to the rise of The Beatles, and therefore to pop history
