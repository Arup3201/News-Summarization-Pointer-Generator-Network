A 36-year-old California man is suing the Michael Jackson estate, claiming the pop star molested him for several years after the two appeared together in a 1988 Pepsi commercial.

The lawsuit filed Friday remains sealed, but sources told the Daily Beast that the new complainant is James Safechuck, a Southern California computer programmer who is married with two children.

Safechuck was 10 years old when he starred in a Pepsi commercial with Jackson, acting the part of a young boy who sneaks into the singer's dressing room during a concert and eventually meets his idol.

New claims: A fifth man has come forward saying Michael Jackson molested him when he was a child. The lawsuit filed Friday remains sealed but sources identified the complainant as James Safechuck, who appeared in a 1988 Pepsi commercial with the pop star. The two pictured in red above in Hawaii

The former commercial actor is adding his name to a previous suit filed last year by 31-year-old Wade Robson, an Australian former-choreographer who claims Jackson sexually abused him at a young age. The two men are being represented by law firm Gradstein & Marzano.

The latest allegations come as a surprise since Safechuck was named as a possible abuse victim by Neverland Ranch staff during Jackson's 2005 criminal case - but he remained silent.

But the former-actor changed his mind after becoming a father himself and undergoing intensive therapy.

'Once you start having children and you see what it’s all about … your perspective on life changes,' a source told the Daily Beast. And a source closest to Safechuck says the man blames 'some of his current issues' on his relationship with Jackson.   

Sources say that Safechuck describes his time with Jackson in the lawsuit, claiming he was molested from the age of 10 until about 14 or 15.

Safechuck was 10 years old when he appeared with Jackson in the Pepsi commercial, and was seen out and about with the pop star for years after.

Befriended: After the commercial, Safechuck remained a fixture in Jackson's life, traveling the world with the singer. Seen above leaving the Mayfair Hotel in London in 1988

Today: Safechuck now works as a computer programmer in Southern California and has since married and went on to have two kids of his own. Pictured in both pictures above in London with Jackson in 1988

During 1988, the year the commercial was shot, Safechuck followed Jackson around the world - attending concerts in Paris, Los Angeles, and London. He was also pictured with the star attending a Pepsi conference in Hawaii and seeing the premiere of The Phantom of the Opera musical on Broadway along with Liza Minelli. Jackson even treated Safechuck to a shopping spree at F.A.O. Schwarz toy store on that New York trip.

When Jackson went to trial for child molestation allegations in 2005, prosecutors gathered testimony from several Neverland Ranch workers who said they feared Safechuck was an abuse victim.

Several workers say Safechuck was a frequent quest and an estate manager testified that he saw Jackson standing in a Jacuzzi with his hands 'down the front of Jimmy's underpants and was manipulating the boy's genitalia'.

Change of heart: When Jackson went to trial for child abuse allegations in 2005, several Neverland Ranch staffers told prosecutors that they suspected Safechuck was a victim. At the time, he refused to acknowledge the allegations

Witness: One Neverland Ranch maid said in 2005 that she saw Jackson and Safechuck naked from the waist up in bed together on two different occasions

A master bedroom maid said she saw the two in bed together, nude from the waist up, on two different occasions.

But because Safechuck never admitted to the abuse, a judge ruled that the allegations wouldn't be included in the trial.

Adding fuel to the latest allegations is a 1994 interview Jackson's sister La Toya gave to Geraldo Rivera. In the interview, La Toya says she and her mother came across a $1million check written to the father of one of Jackson's young male friends. She didn't name the boy, but said the father was a garbage collection.

According to the Daily Beast, Safechuck's father was, and still is, employed in waste management.

Calls placed to both Safechuck's attorney and Harry Weitzman, attorney for the Michael Jackson estate, were not immediately returned Monday evening.

Mr Weitzman previously called Robson's lawsuit a money grab - 'transparent...outrageous and sad.'

Robson also refused to accuse Jackson of molestation during the 2005 trial, and even testified on the late singer's behalf.

But he changed his mind last year, saying he had been brainwashed by Jackson and it wasn't until he had a child of his own that he realized what Jackson did was wrong.

Rosbon claims that the secret of the abuse has led him to have two nervous breakdowns, and he hasn't been able to work.

He once choreographed for Britany Spears, NSYNC, Usher and Pink but has lately been unable to work.
