Black students have achieved the biggest progress in their exam results of any ethnic group in Britain, it was today revealed.

New figures show 58.1 per cent of black pupils scored five A* to C grade passes at GCSE last year, a rise of 8.8 per cent since 2010.

They achieved the greatest rise in both English and maths - with 76.2 per cent and 74.3 per cent of students reaching their expected level of progress.

Meanwhile, just 70.4 per cent and 70.7 per cent of all UK pupils made their predicted grades, according to the the Department of Education statistics obtained by The Independent.

It means black students have narrowed the gap between their GCSE results and the national average by more than half in four years - from 5.8 per cent in 2009 to 2.5 per cent last year.

The improvement in test and exam grades was most significant among black boys from poor families and in sponsored academies, the figures published today showed.

The rise in progress could be due to the 2011 introduction of the English Baccalaureate, which has encouraged schools to enter thousands more pupils for the core academic subjects.

Difference: In GCSE English and maths, 76.2 per cent and 74.3 per cent of black students reached their expected level of progress last year. This is compared with just 70.4 per cent and 70.7 per cent of all UK pupils

The performance measure ranks schools based on the percentage of students who achieve 5+ A*-C grades in English, maths, science, a language and a humanities subject.

It also allows institutions to designate 'pupil premium' funding to disadvantaged pupils, enabling them to address the underlying inequalities which exist between such students and their peers

And it was not just GCSE results in which black students showed a significant improvement.

According to the statistics, 73 per cent of 11-year-olds of black ethnicity reached the expected benchmark in maths, reading and writing exams last year.

This is just two percentage points behind the national 
average - a smaller gap than the five percentage points difference in 2010.

Schools Minister Lord Nash said: 'For years black pupils' results have lagged behind their peers but that gap is being eroded at all levels - the government’s school reforms are
 helping thousands more black pupils, including the poorest, to do well 
at primary school, thrive in their GCSEs, and then succeed in life.

'It
 is particularly through sponsored academies, where long-term 
under-performing local-authority-run schools are being turned around by 
brilliant sponsors, that black pupils are benefiting.

'There are 
proportionately far more black pupils in academies than in council 
schools, and the improving performance of black pupils is reflected in 
the improvements in academies.'

A Department of Education spokesman told MailOnline that the latest figures showed how the government’s education reforms 
are 'raising standards among black pupils more quickly than any other 
ethnic group'.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that dozens of exam qualifications in subjects, such as film studies and home economics, are to be axed.

Regulator Ofqual plans to cull 14 GCSEs and 29 AS and A levels, while reforming other qualifications.

Media studies, for example, is to be revamped at GCSE and AS-level and scrapped at A-level under the proposals.

The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities.

The aim is to make qualifications in different subjects ‘similar in their level of demand and assessment structure’ and to cut out ‘similar or overlapping’ courses.
