Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois admits his Chelsea future next season is 'unclear' ahead of Saturday's Champions League final for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in Lisbon.

The 22-year-old Belgian was signed by Chelsea from Genk for Â£5million in June 2011, but has spent the past three seasons on loan at Atletico, who last weekend were confirmed Primera Division champions ahead of Barcelona and their illustrious city rivals.

Courtois - who faced Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals, making some crucial saves - appreciates the difficulties if he were to return to Stamford Bridge and play understudy to Petr Cech, the 32-year-old named in the Professional Footballers' Association Premier League Team of the Year.

'The two of us want to play everything. Nobody will be happy to play in only the League Cup or FA Cup. Things are unclear at the moment,' Courtois said to BBC Sport.

'I have the biggest respect for Petr Cech. He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, so I think putting him and me in the same team is not the healthiest thing in the world.

'We will see in the next week if we can sit together with Chelsea to find something for next year, find out what they want, what my desire is. We will see.'

Blues boss Jose Mourinho is expected to bolster the Chelsea squad this summer, having finished last season in third place behind Manchester City and Liverpool.

Atletico striker Diego Costa, currently battling against a hamstring injury ahead of the Champions League final, is one reported target.

Defender Ashley Cole has already announced he is set to leave, the 33-year-old out of contract this summer following eight years at Stamford Bridge.

England midfielder Frank Lampard, though, is expected to agree terms on an extension following the World Cup.
