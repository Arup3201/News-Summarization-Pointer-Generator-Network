Victim: Martin Richard, eight, bled to death during the attack at the Boston Marathon in April 2013

Jurors sobbed in court today as a medical examiner detailed the horrific and painful injuries suffered by eight-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the Boston bombings.

Testifying in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Monday, Massachusetts' Chief Medical Examiner Dr Henry Nields, who performed the child's autopsy, revealed Martin had suffered injuries to nearly every part of his body.

Dr Nields was the last witness for the prosecution before it rested its case on Monday.

Martin's parents, Bill and Denise Richard, were also in court. They had been at the marathon finish line with their three children when Martin was killed and their daughter, Jane, lost a leg.

'Cause of death was blast injuries to torso and extremities,' Dr Nields said, adding that Martin died primarily from loss of blood.

Shrapnel - including small nails, plastic, pellets and wood - from one of the homemade pressure cooker bombs set off by Tsarnaev and his older brother had punched through the boy's 69-pound body.

He suffered a six-inch-by-six-inch wound to his left abdomen, which exposed his intestines, and caused damage to his liver, left kidney, spleen and two ribs, Dr. Nields said.

'There was also a perforation of his lower spine,' Dr Nields said, indicating that shrapnel had passed through the child's body and exited through his back.

Lurking: On Monday, this new image was released showing the Richard family watching the race while Tsarnaev stand behind a tree. It shows just how close he came to the family before killing their son

Violent: Evidence taken from the body of another victim, Krystle Campbell, shows the size of the pieces of shrapnel from the bombs. The victims also had nails, wood and plastic inside their bodies

His left arm had also nearly been torn off and his left leg suffered a broken bone and lacerations. The youngster also suffered third-degree burns as well as scrapes to his head and neck.

'Overall, the injuries... would be painful,' Dr Nields said.

As well as presenting the jury with a picture of the child's body - which the public and the boy's parents did not see - the medical examiner also showed them multiple pieces of shrapnel found embedded in his tissue and bones, including nails, plastic, pellets and wood.

He also showed the jury clothing Martin had been wearing on the day of the blast.

Among them, the boy's Patriots football t-shirt and Boston Celtics jersey both showed large tears on their left sides where he had suffered the huge wound to his abdomen.

His shorts had melted in the explosion, while his belt had been used as a tourniquet to try to save his left arm, Dr Nields said.

Martin was one of three people killed on April 15, 2013, while more than 260 others suffered injuries.

On Monday morning, the bomber's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, suggested that Tsarnaev did not purposefully target Martin and his younger sister Jane.

He put the bag near, not behind, the children, Conrad said - but prosecutors suggested he purposefully placed it by the children and even looked back at them after the blast.

The heartbreaking testimony came after the jury heard how another victim, Lingzi Lu, suffered 'very painful' gaping leg wounds from chunks of shrapnel and bled to death within minutes. 

'Her injuries were caused by debris hitting her body and going through her body,' Boston medical examiner Katherine Lindstrom said. 'They would have been very painful.'

Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese national and graduate student at Boston University, had been watching the marathon near the finishing line with friends when the bombs detonated.

Victim: Lingzi Lu, 23, was likely conscious after suffering painful leg injuries when two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. On Monday, the jury in her killer's trial heard graphic details of her death

Chaos: She suffered a devastating injury to her femoral artery after the blast (pictured) and likely passed away within minutes, the medical examiner told the jury at the trial on Monday

Shrapnel punched through her legs, leaving multiple wounds, including one that was seven inches long, Dr Lindstrom testified.

She said Lu's femoral artery in her left leg was essentially cut in half, causing her to bleed to death.

Loss: Krystle Campbell, 29, also died in the attack

'It would have been not immediate, but relatively quickly, seconds to minutes,' she said, adding that Lu did not suffer any head injuries so likely would've been conscious the whole time.

When her body arrived for autopsy, there were still two belts around her leg where someone had attempted to stop her from bleeding out, Dr Linstrom said, the Boston Globe reported.

Inside the injuries, the medical examiner found debris including shrapnel with jagged edges, round metal pellets, small nails, plastic and fabric, she said. 

Photos of Lu's body were shown to the jury. A legal secretary was seen wiping away tears during the testimony, according to a Boston Globe reporter in the courtroom. 

Last Thursday, the jury also heard testimony on the death of 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell. 

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with the bombing attack, as well as shooting Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier dead three days later.

His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died that night after a gunfight with police that ended when Dzhokhar ran him over with a hijacked car. 

Defense lawyers opened the trial last month with a blunt admission that Tsarnaev, a native Chechen, had done everything federal prosecutors claimed. But they contended he did so out of a sense of subservience to his older brother, rather than his own anger at his adopted country.

On trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured left in a photo submitted for evidence, is on trial for carrying out the deadly bombings with his older brother, Tamerlan, right, who later died during a shootout with police

By painting Tamerlan as the driving force behind the attacks, the defense aims to spare the younger Tsarnaev a death sentence and secure him a life sentence instead. 

After the prosecution calls its last witness, the defense will have a chance to call its own witnesses, which could include Tsarnaev himself.

But they will be limited in how much evidence they put forward about the relative blame of the two brothers before the jury determines whether their client is guilty of the charges he faces.

If the jury does find him guilty, the trial will enter a penalty phase, when both sides will call another round of witnesses before the same jury determines whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
