A Chinese man has turned staging suicide attempts into a money making scheme, by threatening to jump to his death unless he is paid cash.

The attempts by the man, identified only as 47-year-old Mr Li, have been so frequent in the central province of Jiangxi that local media has named him 'Brother Building-jumper'.

Mr Li has been climbing buildings and scaffolding at construction sites on a 'tour of suicide extortion' which he is said to have taken across seven provinces.

Mr Li's various 'fake suicide attempts' have made him a minor celebrity on China's social networks, with online commentators both applauding his business acumen, and calling on him to carry out his threat. 

'Li would often make his suicide threats in busy public places or on open construction sites and demand cash from owners or his rescuers,' the state-run Global Times said Wednesday, citing police.

The former air conditioner installer has carried out the scam in more than seven provinces since 2011, the newspaper said, without giving a total number of fake suicide attempts.

Police in Jiangxi finally arrested him when he threatened to jump from the sixth floor of a building under construction over claims for unpaid back pay, it added.

'Officers took Li into custody after (they) lured him down with promises of 800 yuan(£81),' the newspaper said.

Li, from the eastern province of Jiangsu, was said to have extorted 12,000 yuan(£1,217) in total.

Multiple news websites dubbed him 'Brother Building-jumper', and he was a popular topic on China's message boards and local versions of social media.

'Moral degeneracy is currently one of China's special characteristics,' one blasted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter.

'Let him jump!' said another. 

'He does have a knack for good business,' said one of Mr Li's defenders, while another added: 'This kind of behaviour is an art form.'
