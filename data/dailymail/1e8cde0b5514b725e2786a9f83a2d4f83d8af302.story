France and Germany are lagging behind Britain on aid spending to poor countries, a report says.

Both countries have failed to hit EU targets and have barely increased their spending in recent months.

Their reluctance to spend on the Third World contrasts with David Cameron’s determination to ensure that British taxpayers meet our full commitment to overseas spending.

The Prime Minister has come under increasing criticism for raising aid spending by £1.4billion last year in the name of hitting international targets for help for poor countries.

It brought Britain’s overall aid spending to around £9billion at a time of spending cuts in public services.

Critics say much of this is wasted on bureaucracy or misappropriated by corrupt officials and governments abroad. There are also growing numbers of Tory backbenchers opposed to spending large sums of money in aid to comparatively wealthy countries.

India, which is rich enough to afford nuclear weapons and a space programme, is to get £1.4billion from British taxpayers to ease poverty over the next five years.

Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that Britain continues to send aid money to Brazil, even though the Latin American country has now raced ahead of Britain in the world economic league table.

France and Germany’s lack of aid spending was disclosed in a report by the EU statistical arm Eurostat.

It put the level of British foreign aid in 2010 at 0.56 per cent of national income, in line with European targets and on course for the United Nations ambition for wealthy nations to put 0.7 per cent of their spending into aid by 2015.

But Germany put less than 0.4 per cent of its income into aid, barely increased on 2009 levels. France was at just under 0.5 per cent, again a figure only slightly increased in a year.

The EU report was critical of the failure of some countries to push up their aid spending. ‘Contributions varied considerably between member states in 2010,’ it said. ‘It seems unlikely that the EU will achieve its 2015 target. At current growth rates, it would only happen around 2040.’

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under domestic criticism for her reluctance to keep promises of big increases in aid spending.

And French President Nicolas Sarkozy promised a 20 per cent increase in aid last year. But critics say France is trying to pad its figures with debt relief, remittances sent by immigrant workers in France, and spending on its overseas territories.

The United States pays out around 0.2 per cent of its income in foreign aid.
