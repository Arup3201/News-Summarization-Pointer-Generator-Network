Yelp users will now not only know where to get the best dim sum, but how clean the establishment is.

The user review site has announced today that it is adding restaurant’s health-inspection grades to its site, giving discerning users yet another filter through which they can decide where to eat.

For now, the service is available in San Francisco, and New York City will be added within the next few weeks with plans to expand to Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago.

By the code: Yelp is now including health scores in its reviews, located below the restaurants' address

Details: By clicking on the score, Yelp users can see how many violations the restaurant has and when they occurred

The health departments of New York have assigned letter grades – A, B, C, or fail – for dining establishments in these cities.

For San Francisco businesses, the new program displays restaurant health scores – for example, 92 out of 100. Anything above 90 points gets a ‘good’ rating, meaning there are low health risks.

Anywhere from 86-90 is considered adequate, 71-85 needs improvement, and anything less than 70 is poor. Points are taken away for violations and are given in accordance to the severity of the violation.

Clicking on the number takes users to a page with more detailed information about the restaurant's recent inspections.

The company, which is itself based in San Francisco, says its engineers have been working with the cities in designing technology that lets municipalities publish inspection information on its website.

It means, especially in San Francisco where restaurants are not required to visibly post the findings of health reports, that there will be more transparency between the health department, the city’s restaurants, and consumer choice.

In plain sight: New York City restaurants must prominently display their grade from the Department of Health, ranging from A, B, C, or grade pending

Grading system: In New York, restaurants are awarded an A, B, C, or fail grade; grade pending means that the restaurant initially received a B or a C but has been given a limited amount of time to improve

Nobu, 105 Hudson Street – A

Katz’s Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St. – A

Mr Chow, 324 E. 57th St – A

Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, 220 W. 44th St., A

Magnolia Bakery, 401 Bleecker St., A

The Health Department of New York has required that letter grades be posted since July 2010. It inspects around 24,000 restaurants a year to make sure each establishment complies with health codes. 

All New York restaurants must post the Department of Health grades on the outside of their establishments.

The code itself looks at things such as how the food is handled, the temperature at which it is served, the hygiene of the restaurant’s employees, maintenance, and vermin control. 

Restaurants are given two chances to earn an A – if they are not given an ‘A’ at the initial inspection, they are given around a month to improve.

Yelp’s Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Stoppelman said that the measures will have ‘a good impact on society,’ according to Bloomberg. ‘In the weeks ahead, we hope to have all of San Francisco’s restaurants online. We’ll then begin migrating New York data online as well.’

A study from UC Berkeley showed that higher Yelp ratings, even by half a star, made a restaurant more likely to have a full house for dinner.
