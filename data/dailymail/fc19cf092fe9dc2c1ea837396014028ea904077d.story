Senators lashed out at Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday during a hearing about America's response to the ISIS terror army, as lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle agreed that the Obama administration needs a new approval from Congress if it plans to continue bombing raids and other 'offense' measures past the end of the month.

The White House is operating under the authority of the U.S. Constitution, which allows the president to wage war for 90 days in the face of a national security threat without going to Capitol Hill for permission.

That period expires in a few weeks, but the administration plans to rely on a Bush-era Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), granted by Congress in 2001, to continue.

'You're going to need a new AUMF, and it'll have to be more tailored,' Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's chairman, told Kerry. 

His GOP counterpart, ranking Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, was far more aggressive, barking that President Obama and a coterie of supportive senators 'are exercising terrible judgment right now' by deploying America's military in Iraq 'regardless of what we say.'

Kerry was faced with one of his former Senate colleagues blasting: 'Do you realize how unserious the things that you have laid out, and the things that were laid out yesterday, sound?'

Corker slammed Kerry for backing a White House plan 'that you say is going to be multi-year – some people say a decade.'

The 2001 AUMF specifically authorized the government to attack al-Qaeda inside Iraq. Now the administration is attacking ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, and has pledged to pursue the terror group into Syria if necessary.

'Taking us into another country with a different enemy is exercising the worst judgment possible,' Corker said.

Kerry insisted that he favors a new congressional authorization for the Obama administration. 'We're asking you to do it,' he said. 'Pass it tomorrow.'

But Corker said Kerry was 'asking us to do it, but you're not giving any details because you don't have them.'

Kerry insisted that the administration would wait to share more information with Congress until retired General John Allen, the president's special envoy, had a chance to run elbows with potential partner states during an upcoming United Nations meeting.

'Do you realize how unserious the things that you have laid out, and the things that were laid out yesterday, sound?' Corker asked. 

'It seems like a – it seems like a political answer.'

'I hope you'll lay out a plan that will convince us that you're serious about doing the things you said you're going to do, to the American people and to us, about ISIL,' he continued. 'Because you haven't done it now.'

The fast-moving ISIS episode saw several new developments on Wednesday. 

The House of Representatives approved a measure that would provide funds for a train-and-equip mission designed to help 'moderate' Syrian rebel groups battle both ISIS and the country's dictator, Bashar al-Assad.

And disagreements continued to swirl over whether a ground incursion will ultimately have to be part of President Barack Obama's wartime toolbox.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi insisted that her position was a ‘blanket "no",' mirroring the pledge the president made hours earlier to an audience of servicemen and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida.

But former Defense Secretary Robert Gates claimed that the U.S. will need to put boots on the ground if there is ‘to be any hope of success.' 

Earlier in Wednesday's hearing, Kerry deviated from his prepared testimony to rake the far-left female-dominated protest group CODEPINK over the coals for objecting to the U.S. government's military involvement in an anti-ISIS campaign.

The terror group, he said, 'is killing and raping and mutilating women.'

'They're cold-blooded killers marauding across the Middle East, making a mockery of a peaceful religion,' Kerry said of the Islamist terror army.

Like Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee hearing was preceded by a handful of the group's activists holding signs and shouting anti-war slogans in the hearing room.

Kerry said he respected their right to protest, but took time out to upbraid them personally for standing in the Obama administration's way.

Not impressed: Senators from both side of the aisle had doubts on Wednesday about the mechanics and goals of the Obama administration's approach to fighting ISIS, and the legal justification for waging war without permission from Congress

After reading the first four paragraphs of a five-page prepared statement, the norally taciturn Kerry launched into an impromptu offensive against the protesters.

'You know, as I came in here, obviously we had some folks who spoke out. And I would start by saying that I understand dissent. I've lived it,' he said, referring to his leadership of Vietname Veterans Against the War nearly 40 years ago. 'That's how I first testified in front of this country in 1971.'

But CODEPINK, he said, 'was started by a woman, or women, who were opposed to war but who also thought that government's job was to take care of people, give them health care, and education, and good jobs.'

'And if that's what you believe in, and I believe it is, then you ought to care about fighting ISIL,' he said, referring to ISIS by the alternative name preferred by the Obama administration.

'Because ISIL is killing and raping and mutilating women. And they believe women shouldn't have an education. They sell off girls to be sex slaves to jihadists.'

CODEPINK is the brainchild of Medea Benjamin, a wealthy San Francisco peace activist who was herself arrested in March during a visit to Cairo while en route to a women's rights conference in Gaza. 

The pro-Palestinian agitator claimed later that she suffered a dislocated shoulder and a broken arm as Egyptian airport police in the Muslim Brotherhood-run capital city restrained her.

Kerry emphasized that 'there is nothing to negotiate' with ISIS. 

'They're not offering anyone health care of any kind. They're not offering education of any kind,' he said, addressing the protesters in the room.

Kerry insisted that the Obama administration's strategy will stop ISIS 'from denying the women and the girls and the people of Iraq the very future that they yearn for'

Medea Benjamin was arrested on July 30 during a civil-disobedience protest in front of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC. CODEPINK was protesting the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza

Benjamin was last seen Tuesday in a different Senate hearing, shouting slogans before Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey testified about the war on ISIS

'For a whole philosophy, or idea, or cult – whatever you want to call it – that frankly comes out of the stone age, they're cold-blooded killers marauding across the Middle East, making a mockery of a peaceful religion.'

'And that's precisely why we are building a coalition to try to stop them from denying the women and the girls and the people of Iraq the very future that they yearn for,' Kerry said. 'And frankly, CODEPINK and a lot of other people need to stop and think about how you stop them and deal with that.'

In response, a protester shouted five times, as police led her out: 'Your invasion will not protect the homeland!'

After his opening statement, Ranking Republican Senator Bob Corker challenged Kerry for presiding over a 'political answer' to Middle Eastern unrest that's an 'unserious' path to defeating ISIS.

Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is among the panel's most liberal members, echoed Kerry's outrage.

ISIS, she said, 'is selling 14-year-olds' and 'giving them as gifts to their fighters.'

'They say, "If you don't take our twisted version of Islam, you either flee, you convert, or you die.'
