Downton Abbey fans can now bring the post-Edwardian look into their own homes after the paint used on set of the hit series went on sale to the general public.

The deep shades of grey, used in the kitchen on the period TV drama, were chosen by producers because they were colours commonly used at the time.

The authentic colours were whipped up from recipes that are over 100 years old and have been kept in production by an historic paint company.

Authentic: The kitchen in Downton Abbey, pictured here, was painted using deep grey tones that were chosen to reflect colours that were popular during the Edwardian and post-Edwardian era

Back in time: Now Mylands, a company who specialises in recreating vintage lacquers using traditional recipes of the time, has created two shades that will allow modern home-owners to replicate the Downton look, above, for themselves

The hues, Empire Grey and Amber Grey, are made using earth pigments and ground up marble to create the traditional look.

They were created by paint company Mylands, who have been mixing different lacquers since 1884 using techniques that date back to the Georgian and Edwardian times.

The paints were used to decorate the stately home’s kitchen, one of the main settings of the show which follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family.

After the success of Downton Abbey the two stunning shades are now on sale to the general public so that people can recreate the style in their own houses.

Prices start from £18.50 for one litre of paint.

Get the look: The kitchens on the set of the popular television show,  filmed at Highclere Castle, were painted using deep gray tones created especially for set designers by Mylands, who are now making the paint available for the general public to buy

Classic: Empire Grey and Amber Grey were whipped up using recipes that dated back more than 100 years

The award-winning series is filmed at Highclere Castle near Newbury, Berks, and Ealing Studios in London.

A much anticipated fourth series, starring Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern, is due to air this autumn.

A spokeswoman for Mylands, based in South London, said: 'We started trading in 1884 with a shop in Stradwell selling paints and wood finishes.

'We began supplying them to theatres and art galleries and started selling paint to film and television companies since the 1920s.

'The founder, John Myland, used recipes for a lot of really old, incredible colours dating back to the Georgian and Medieval times from local traders.

'We have used these recipes since then and we believe that it is how authentic our colours are that make us so popular.

'Our paints are also made from ground marble which gives them a wonderful matte finish.

'We have been selling paint to the production team behind Downton Abbey since it started in 2010, and after its success we decided to sell them to the general public.

'People can now achieve true Downton Abbey style by using authentic paint that is made exactly how it was 100 years ago with earth pigments.'
