A policeman at the centre of the Scotland Yard racism crisis is to be prosecuted for allegedly abusing a suspect.

PC Alex MacFarlane, 52, was apparently recorded telling a 21-year-old black man he ‘will always be a n*****’ during last summer’s riots.

The decision to act is a  U-turn for the Crown Prosecution Service who originally expressed doubts about the case.

Charges: PC Alex MacFarlane (pictured) is to be charged with racially abusing a suspect during the summer riots

But after being threatened with a 
High Court challenge, the CPS now says MacFarlane can be charged with a 
racially aggravated public order offence.

MacFarlane, a response officer based 
in Newham, East London, has been suspended from duty since Mauro 
Demetrio claimed he was abused in the back of a police van on August 10.

His recording forced senior officers to confront a backlog of outstanding racism claims.

There are now 11 allegations involving
18 officers and a civilian worker under investigation by Scotland Yard 
and the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Alison Saunders, chief prosecutor for
London, said she had advised the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission to charge Pc MacFarlane despite the CPS's decision not to 
charge him in January.

'In 
March, the complainant's lawyers challenged that decision and, in 
accordance with standard CPS practice, Grace Ononiwu, Deputy Chief Crown
Prosecutor for CPS London, directed that the case be reviewed by a more
senior lawyer who was not previously involved.

'That review is now complete and the conclusion, based on all the evidence now available, is that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction to charge Pc MacFarlane with a racially aggravated public order offence contrary to Section 4a of the Public Order Act 1986 and Section 31 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

'When a review shows a previous decision
not to prosecute is wrong, it is open to the CPS to rectify that error 
by bringing new proceedings.'

Ms Saunders said the original CPS decision was 'regrettable', adding that a prosecution was necessary to maintain public confidence.

Pc MacFarlane was suspended from his duties following a review of the mobile phone footage.

The arrested man, named as Mauro Demetrio, 21, from Beckton, east London, was held on suspicion of drug-driving in August last year but no action was later taken.

The charging announcement came as Met Commissioner Bernard-Hogan Howe appeared before MPs over the force's review of racist allegations.

Ms Saunders said: 'As Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, I have taken the decision in this case that, as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and a prosecution being in the public interest, a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system.

'That is the test I must apply under the Code for Crown Prosecutors when reinstituting a prosecution.

'Accordingly, I have advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge Pc MacFarlane.

'It is regrettable that the original decision was wrong, but I hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the CPS to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary.'

An additional charge of assault relating to an allegation of 'strangulation' will not be pursued, the CPS said.

There are now 11 separate racism allegations under investigation at the Met Police involving 10 police officers

Ms Saunders added: 'However, having now had opportunity to consider all available evidence, including the statements of others in the van alongside the recording, the lawyer reviewing the case concluded that the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened were such that no additional charge could properly be added.

'The inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant - the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this.

'There is also inconsistency over why the officer, who does accept that he took hold of the complaint, did so. He and other witnesses say it was in response to the complainant's apparent aggression and in self-defence.

'I agree with the conclusion that, in the circumstances, there is insufficient evidence to meet the Code test for bringing charges.'

Another allegation of abuse by a police officer against a youth at Forest Gate police station remains under consideration, the CPS said.
