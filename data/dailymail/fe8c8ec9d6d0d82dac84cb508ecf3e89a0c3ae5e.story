Pizzas sold by takeaways and supermarkets are so stuffed with salt they are putting the health of customers at risk of high blood pressure and strokes.

Many contain more salt than an adult should consume in an entire day, according to new research which suggests pizzas are getting less healthy.

The worst examples were a Stuffed Crust Sausage & Pepperoni pizza from Papa John’s and the now-discontinued Domino’s Pepperoni Passion Hot Dog Stuffed Crust, which both came in at 16g of salt.

Pizzas sold by takeaways and supermarkets are so stuffed with salt they are putting the health of customers at risk of high blood pressure and strokes. A Stuffed Crust Sausage & Pepperoni pizza from Papa John’s (pictured),  had 16g of salt

That is almost three teaspoons and some 2.7 times more than the 6g maximum recommended for an adult for an entire day.

A survey by health campaigners found that nearly three quarters of all restaurants and takeaway pizzas - 586 out of 802 - surveyed contain more salt than recommended for a day.

Pizzas sold by supermarkets were better, however some still contain relatively high levels for a single meal.

A Tesco Stuffed Crust Cheese Feast Takeaway Pizza came in 7.2g, and the store’s Thin & Tasty Simply Pepperoni Stone Baked Pizza measured 5.8g.

The now-discontinued Domino’s Pepperoni Passion Hot Dog Stuffed Crust (pictured) also had 16g of salt, which is some 2.7 times more than the 6g maximum recommended for an adult for an entire day

Generally, a customer will eat a whole pizza, however retailers give their nutrition label information based on the assumption that consumers will eat only half or less, which can be misleading.

Eating high levels of salt over a lifetime is associated with developing high blood pressure and related conditions.

The research was carried out by the campaigning group Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), which said the food industry is failing to deliver on a promise to reduce levels.

It said some products appear to carry more salt than when it surveyed pizzas two years ago. For example, Sainsbury’s Thin & Crispy Cheese & Tomato Pizza now has 1.3g of salt per 100g, up from 0.88 in 2012.

The salt content of Pizza Express branded margherita and pepperoni pizzas sold in supermarkets has also increased.

Researchers found that only one third – 38per cent - of pizzas targeted at children in restaurants would meet salt targets drawn up by the Department of Health, which is 1.8g per portion.

Some products, including the Pizza Express branded margherita sold in supermarkets appeared to carry more salt than when CASH surveyed pizzas two years ago

Nutritionist at CASH, Sonia Pombo,  said: ‘Most of us aren’t aware of how much salt we actually eat on a daily basis, and thus the danger we are putting ourselves in.

‘With three-quarters of our salt intakes coming from processed foods such as pizza, how are any of us able to choose a healthier diet? We need the food industry to help us improve our diet, not to hide 3 times more salt than is recommended in a day in a single pizza.’

The CASH chairman, Graham MacGregor, the Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Barts & The London School of Medicine, said: ‘Eating too much salt puts up our blood pressure, the major cause of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure, the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

‘At the World Health Assembly in May 2013 it was unanimously agreed that all countries should reduce their daily salt intake by 30per cent towards a target of up to 5g per day, by 2025.

‘Our survey has shown that many pizza manufacturers are still adding very large and completely unnecessary amounts of salt to their pizzas. This is completely unacceptable and our advice is to avoid eating pizzas from these manufacturers.’

Researchers also looked at pizzas sold in other countries and found even higher levels. The saltiest pizza surveyed is the Pizza Hut Meat Lovers Thin N Crispy sold in the USA which contains 23.6g salt per large pizza.

The study found some stores and brands are able to provide pizza with lower salt levels. For example, a Virtuous Veg Pizzetta from Pizza Hut comes in at 1.67g; a Buffala from Zizzi is 0.6g salt and a Salsiccia (Prima) from ASK Italian is 1.8g.

Generally, a customer will eat a whole pizza, however retailers give their nutrition label information based on the assumption that consumers will eat only half or less
