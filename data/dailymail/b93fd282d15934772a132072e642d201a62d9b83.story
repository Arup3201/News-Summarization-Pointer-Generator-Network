A group of university students are to have their lectures on criminology behind bars, alongside some of Britain’s most dangerous offenders.

The scheme will see undergraduates from Durham University discuss drugs and the causes of crime with criminals at a high-security prison.

Posters have been displayed around HMP Frankland and HMP Durham encouraging inmates to join the ten-week course, although sexual offenders will not be allowed to attend.

Dr Kate O’Brien, who spent 18 months developing the programme, said: ‘It is about inviting prisoners to take time to reflect. It will be nothing like I’ve experienced or the students have experienced before.’

Students from Durham University will discuss crime and the effectiveness of the prison system over the ten-week course. 

Posters displayed around the prison invited inmates to apply for the course, with sexual offenders excluded.

Candidates were then interviewed before undergoing a strict vetting procedure before being granted their place in the classroom.

The course will see a dozen third year criminology students venturing into the prison for a weekly three-hour lecture where they will sit with the 12 selected male criminals.

The students involved have also undergone a rigorous inspection to ensure that they have no links to any of the offenders and have no criminal past.

During the supervised discussions, the students will sit alternately in a circle while helped by a teaching assistant and two facilitators.

While it is not yet know what offenders have been chosen to study the course, details of the course show that they will discuss drugs policy and the causes of crime.

Students will also attend lectures with prisoners at HMP Durham, a category B prison.

The contentious ‘Inside Out’ programme is the first of its kind to be launched in Europe, having first been trialled in an American prison in 1997.

Academics travelled to Temple University in Philadelphia, where the programme was first developed, to learn how prisoners and students can both be incorporated into the classroom.

The American programme has seen over 20,000 students venture into prisons to take part in classes.

HMP Frankland has been blighted by problems including attacks on prison officers and high drug use among prisoners in recent times.

Dr O’Brien said: ‘It is about inviting prisoners to take time to reflect on their own experiences and recognise their capacity to make changes. It is about the dialogue and interaction.’

Angie Petit, the deputy governor at Durham prison said: ’Durham prison is continuously looking for ways to help prisoners break the cycle of re-offending, whether through the work or education opportunities we provide.’
