A chocolate-loving monkey was shot with a Taser gun by French police this week after it caused 'bedlam' at an elementary school by attacking children to get to their food.

The African macaque had apparently been living in the Castellanne neighborhood of Marseilles for several weeks and police were  called more than a dozen times over its unruly behaviour.

Officers suspect the monkey was raised illegally and then abandoned in the city - forcing it to survive on Kinder chocolate scraps given to it by children.

Stunned: The mischievous African macaque is tended to by a vet after being shot with a Taser gun by French police in Marseilles

The primate was said to have 'caused bedlam' by harassing school pupils, and even scratching some, in its frenzied attempt to get to their chocolate.

It took police weeks to catch the monkey and they say its chocolate-only diet has led to malnutrition -  which officers believe caused the monkey to become more aggressive.

A police spokesperson said: 'We were given the location, but the time we got there he had left every time.'

'It is a lesser evil, the maximum we wanted to do to not have to kill him,' they added, reports New York Daily news.

Finally caught: The primate was said to have 'caused bedlam' by harassing school pupils, and even scratching some. It was not caught until weeks later

On Monday, an officer finally managed to catch up with the elusive animal and stun it before putting it in a cage. 

The monkey was fed bananas and other treats once it was checked by a vet - and police say it soon became friendly.

Officers are still searching for the animal's original owner, who could face charges of illegally possessing a wild animal.

Following a quarantine period the macaque will be taken to live in a local zoo.
