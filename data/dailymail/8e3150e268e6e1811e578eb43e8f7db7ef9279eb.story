Meeting: Sgt Sean Murphy meets with Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the Boston bombings

The police officer who last week released graphic photographs of the Boston bomber as he was apprehended has met with Jeff Bauman, the 27-year-old who lost both legs in the blast.

The informal meeting, in which the men chatted over lunch as Bauman showed off his new prosthetic legs, came as the officer, Sgt Sean Murphy, was placed on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is completed.

Bauman's appearance beside Murphy adds to the growing support for the beleaguered officer, who has been called a hero for standing up for the victims of the bombings.

The tactical photographer was suspended for a day from the Massachusetts State Police after releasing 14 photographs of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he was caught on April 19, even though he was not authorized to do so.

Murphy said that he released the graphic images to Boston Magazine after he became so enraged at how Rolling Stone magazine had depicted Tsarnaev as a rock star by putting him on its cover.

On Tuesday, there was a closed hearing to 
determine his future in the job and he was placed on restricted duty. He will now be on desk duty - where he will have no contact with the public - until an investigation is completed.

Jeff Bauman 
was with a Boston Herald writer in Maine at the weekend when they heard Murphy was in 
the area and invited him over to meet the bombing victim.

'Minutes later, [he] was at the door,' Gerry Callahan explained in an article for the paper. 'All he wanted to know was how Bauman was doing.'

The
men enjoyed lunch and Murphy marveled as Bauman, who lost both legs in 
the blast and much of his hearing, showed how he could walk on his prosthetic limbs.

Despite being branded a hero by those 
affected by the bombings, Murphy's future in the police department is 
uncertain after he released the images without their approval.

He argued that the music magazine had glamorized terrorism and dismissed the victims and their families by running a picture Tsarnaev, who turned 20 last week, had taken of himself.

Murphy said that his images, which he took as Tsarnaev was apprehended, showed the 
true face of terrorism, but he was reprimanded for releasing them 
without authorization and suspended.

After he was suspended, he received the backing of the families of MIT police officer Sean 
Collier, who was allegedly shot dead by the Tsarnaev brothers in the aftermath of the April 15 attacks.

Angry: Sgt Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorization of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he released these graphic photos of the night he was apprehended

Caught: Tsarnaev, then 19, was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard in Watertown on April 15

The family slammed Rolling Stone for 'portraying the
face of evil' and called for the Massachusetts State Police 
officer to be reinstated.

A
statement, printed by Boston Magazine, read: 'We, the family of slain 
MIT police officer, Sean Collier, were fortunate to get to know Sgt Sean
Murphy in the days following Sean’s death.

'Sgt. Murphy was a member of the 
dedicated contingent of Massachusetts State Police Officers who are 
responsible for helping families plan and organise the funerals of 
police officers killed in the line of duty.

'With
the help of Sgt Murphy, his fellow state police, and the officers of 
the MIT Police Department, our family was able to get through those dark
days.

'Terrorists are not rock stars and they 
should not be rewarded with fame and magazine covers. The real heroes 
are the law enforcement officers, first responders, and victims of this 
terror. It is they who should be honored.'

The images, which Murphy took, show the alleged bomber bruised and bloodied with his hands in the air as he emerges from his final hiding place.

Murphy had accompanied Swat teams as 
they descended on a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home, where 
Tsarnaev sought refuge following one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. 
history.

Murphy
has been labeled a 'hero' for his actions by many with popular option -
especially in Boston - that he did the right thing to counteract the cover of the current issue of Rolling Stone.

More 
than 10,000 people have 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page and supporters have also taken to Twitter to call him a hero.

Federal prosecutors however were quick to voice their displeasure at Murphy’s actions.

Backing: Supporters have set up a Facebook page to back Sgt Murphy, whom they called a 'hero'

'The release of these photos was completely unacceptable,'
said a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen M Ortiz, whose prosecutors
are preparing a case against Tsarnaev on 30 federal charges.

'We 
have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us 
that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking
action internally in response.'

It
is unclear whether the photos could damage the federal case against the
man accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs that killed three 
people and injured more than 260.
