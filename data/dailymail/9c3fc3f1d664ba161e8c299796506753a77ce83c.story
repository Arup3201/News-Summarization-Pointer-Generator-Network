With its own cinema, hairdressing salon and even beach huts, what looks like a plush country retreat is in fact Britain's most luxurious care home, built at a cost of £8.5million.

The state-of-the-art complex with 60 en-suite bedrooms features a town square, and when outside residents can relax in beach huts, in specially-themed gardens or underneath gazebos.

However, the luxury comes at a cost with weekly fees start at £980 for residential care at Linden House, although this does include everything a resident may need - including styling by the full-time hairdresser.

Caring: Built at a cost of £8.5million and boasting its own cinema, Linden House in Lymington, Hampshire stakes a claim to be Britain's most luxurious care home

Great outdoors: Outside residents can relax in beach huts, in specially-themed gardens or underneath gazebos

The new complex in Lymington, Hampshire, aims to provide the perfect environment for people living with dementia.

Navigational aids such as colour-coded doors help the home’s residents find their way around the three-storey care home.

Meanwhile, Linden Square - the home’s internal 'outside space' - reflects the town’s historic past and helps those with dementia stimulate their memory.

In fact, the entrance leads through a shop-themed area and additional spaces reflect landscapes and features in and around Lymington.

Owned and run by Lymington-based Colten Care, Linden House features four house groups of 15 residents each and has created 100 jobs.

The home also boasts three hotel suites which are free of charge for relatives who have travelled to visit residents.

Manager Jackie Hampton said: 'Colten already provides three dementia-specific care homes, giving us a huge body of knowledge about the different dementia journeys people can take.

'Living in small, friendly groups gives residents the chance to continue practical skills and retain their spirit of independence for as long as possible.'

Well-travelled: The home's cafe area is themed around global travels and offers residents a place to take afternoon tea

Kitted out: Some en suite rooms come with hydrotherapy spa baths

The home is built on the site of an earlier care home that was closed by Hampshire County Council.

Inside, there is an activities room and a cafe offering afternoon tea, as well as a family kitchen for the resident’s relatives.

The cost of residential care can vary hugely by location and depends on whether you require nursing care, which your care needs assessment will determine. 

If you do require nursing care this will increase your care home costs considerably.

It is also important to bear in mind that although you may not need nursing care now, this could change in the future. 

On average you can expect to pay more than £27,200 a year in residential care costs which can rise to over £37,500 a year if nursing care is necessary. 

On average care home fees cost around £26,312 in the east midlands, £24,336 in the north west and £31,000 in London. 

In the south of England, care home prices average at around £30,000 a year but Linden House in Hampshire will set you back around £47,040 a year and that is a starting figure. 

Residents can also take advantage of the outside boules area amongst the home’s beautifully-manicured gardens,or practice their golf on Linden House's putting green.

The rooms are large and spacious with high quality finishes throughout and some en-suite rooms come with hydrotherapy spa baths.

The purpose-built home reflects the latest thinking in dementia care and memory loss.

Prospective
 residents are subject to a pre-admission assessment, and fees are based
 on a person's needs, although they are all-inclusive.

The
 New Forest, where the home is situated, is a popular retirement area 
where dementia cases are expected to rise 43 per cent in the next 20 
years.

Colten Care’s chief 
executive Mark Aitchison said: 'We’re a family-run group, determined to 
set the highest standards in all aspects of care.

'Linden
 House incorporates the latest therapeutic approaches and facilities for
 dementia care, all within an elegant, beautifully designed building.'

Spacious: One of the home's 60 en-suite bedrooms

Music room: A piano in one of the home's lounge areas provides residents with some musical entertainment

 Linden Square, an internal 'outside' space has been designed to look like a town square to stimulate the memory of people with dementia.

Studies have shown that nostalgic scenes, such as the Square, or images can trigger happy memories in people with diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Recalling instances from a person's long-term memories can help carers and loved ones to engage with people with dementia in a positive way, as well as improving the quality of life for the 800,000 people living with dementia in the UK.

Many people with dementia are also encouraged to take part in art or musical projects as part of their cognitive therapy, and experts believe that such activities can help a person reconnect with themselves as well as their carers and family, and even slow their decline.
