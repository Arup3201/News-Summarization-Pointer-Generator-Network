A northeast Ohio woman has been charged with felonious assault for allegedly stabbing her boyfriend after yelling at him for eating all of the couple’s salsa.

A police report says 61-year-old Ronnie Buckner told officers he was eating salsa with his girlfriend, Phyllis Jefferson, at his Akron, Ohio, apartment Sunday when she started complaining that he was eating all of it.

Buckner told police that 50-year-old Jefferson then started yelling and then stabbed him in his pelvis with a pen.

Jefferson allegedly then went to smash the television, but when Buckner grabbed it she took off for the kitchen and grabbed a knife.

She's then accused of stabbing him in the left side of the stomach.

Buckner was found holding his stomach and covered in blood outside his apartment when police arrived.

Jefferson sped away, but police say they later stopped and arrested her on Interstate 77, reports Cleveland.com.

She’s also charged with misdemeanor criminal endangering. Court records list no attorney for her.

Buckner was hospitalized for his injuries, which appeared not to be life-threatening.
