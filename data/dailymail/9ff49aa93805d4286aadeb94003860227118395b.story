Chelsea are weighing up a deal for 18-year-old Cameroon forward Fabrice Olinga, who has been on trial at Sampdoria.

Former Blues forward Samuel Eto'o, who has just moved to the Italian side, recommended him to Sampdoria and the move alerted Chelsea.

The eight-cap Cameroon international has previously played for Malaga and Belgian side Zulte Waregem.

He was loaned to Cypriot club Apollon Limassol at the beginning of this season but the Malaga youngster returned to the Spanish club and could now move to England.

Olinga netted his first and only goal for Cameroon during the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations against Cape Verde - becoming his nation's youngest-ever scorer in the process.
