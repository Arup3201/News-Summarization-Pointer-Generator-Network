A violent three hour standoff came to a dramatic conclusion Friday when officers gunned him down as he ran outside shooting at police.

Emmanuel Wooten, 20, holed up inside the Meridian, Mississippi, home after fleeing police two days earlier while they tried to apprehend him for shooting a young girl. Family members he held hostage were released unharmed, but he did not make it off the property alive.

SWAT officers filled the home with tear gas after confirming all the hostages were out safely, according to WTOK – that was the beginning of the end.

‘There was a third person who had came out of the house early this morning to verify he was in the house as well as a female who was later taken hostage,’ a police spokesperson told the station.

SWAT promised Wooten that if he emerged unarmed with his hands in the air that he would not be harmed – he instead released his girlfriend and cousin, police said.

‘We set up a hard perimeter around the house. The one male individual left the house and was taken into custody,’ the spokesperson continued. 

‘He provided us with information to verify the individual was in the house as well as a female. We continued communications with the individual in the house via text messages.’

The officers then tossed tear gas canisters into the home to flush him out.

He fired three gunshots at the officers before emerging just after 12.30 p.m., police said.

The wanted man continued blasting away as he came out of the front entrance to the home, the officers had no choice but to return fire, sources told the station.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.

Wooten was the primary suspect in the shooting last week of a 10-year-old, according to WTOK. She is still recovering from her injuries but is expected to live, authorities said.

The fugitive exchanged more than a dozen shots with officers earlier this week, a witness told the Meridian Star. He was injured in the shootout but had not surfaced until Friday.
