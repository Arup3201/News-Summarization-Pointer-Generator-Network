Tory MP Nicholas Soames, grandson of wartime PM Winston Churchill, wants learning the words of God Save The Queen to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum.

And TV presenter and Liberal Democrat peer Floella Benjamin has called for pupils to sing the anthem at the start of each day.

Schoolchildren should learn the words of the national anthem as part of the national curriculum, Tory MP Nicholas Soames said

This summer some Olympic athletes faced criticism for not singing the anthem and England football manager Roy Hodgson ordered his players to learn the words for the Euro 2012 tournament.

Mr Soames said learning the words was a vital part of being British, and if the government was serious about encouraging a sense of citizenship the national anthem should be on the curriculum.

He told MailOnline: ‘Now we live in such a diverse society I think it is very important that all schoolchildren in Great Britain are taught the national anthem.

‘I am absolutely amazed that they are
not. I think people would be surprised if they knew that people who 
live in this country do not know the words of the anthem.

‘It is extraordinary that the 
government bangs on about citizenship and then be completely ambivalent 
about whether or not people know the national anthem.'

Tory MP Nicholas Soames said if children were to learn about British citizenship and history they should also be taught the words to the national anthem. HIs grandfather was Word War Two Prime Minister Winston Churchill 

Mr Soames added: ‘I think it should be compulsory. Maybe at the end of term and on special occasions.

‘As one cannot rely on parents to teach anyone anything these days, it is something schools should do.’

God save our gracious Queen!Long live our noble Queen!God save the Queen!Send her victorious,Happy and glorious,Long to reign over us,God save the Queen.

Thy choicest gifts in storeOn her be pleased to pour,Long may she reign.May she defend our laws,And ever give us cause,To sing with heart and voice,God save the Queen.

He tabled a parliamentary question asking the Department for Education to adopt a ‘policy that children in all schools in England are taught the National Anthem’.

But education minister Liz Truss replied: ‘It is a matter for individual schools to decide whether to teach pupils the National Anthem.’

Now Mr Soames  plans to raise the matter personally with Mr Gove, ‘because I don’t think it is good enough’.

He added: ‘I can see some bolshie left wing headteacher refusing to teach the national anthem to their children.

‘I just think we do now live in a very diverse nation and our unwritten constitution and everything that goes with it – the church, the crown, the law – if we are going to teach that which we must if people are going to love the country, they should know the national anthem.’

A source close to Mr Gove said: 'Michael thinks this is a fantastic idea and supports what Nicholas is saying ultimately this is up to local schools to decide.'

Earlier this year Baroness Benjamin used a debate in the House of Lords to suggest the anthem should be sung at the start of each school day.

Winners of the Men's Four Final Alex Gregory, Peter Reed, Tom James and Andrew Triggs Hodge were among the Team GB athletes who sang the national anthem after winning a gold medal

England manager Roy Hodgson told his players they had to sing the National Anthem during the Euro 2012 tournament

The former Play School presenter told peers: ‘I loved my school days. Starting back in Trinidad, where I was born, we sang the national anthem at the beginning of each school day.

‘It gave me a sense of national pride, which has served me well.

‘Seeing young children waving their union jacks with pride during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, it occurred to me that perhaps we should start each school day with the singing of our national anthem so that they have a sense of national pride embedded in their psyche-because the feeling of being proud of who you are is the best confidence booster, which in turn helps with learning.’

In June Mr Hodgson asked England's players to sing the National Anthem in unison in one of his first initiatives as manager.

Former players said it was the first time they could remember the whole team singing together at the start of a match.

During the London Olympic and Paralympic Games some of the most emotional scenes came when the anthem was played when Team GB athletes were presented with gold medals.

Angered by the sight of some sportsmen and women not joining in, newspaper columnist Piers Morgan pledged to donate £1,000  to Great Ormond Street Hospital every time a British winner sang the national anthem in their medals ceremony.
