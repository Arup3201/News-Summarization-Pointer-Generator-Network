Leon Taylor was sentenced to death for killing gas station attendant Robert Newton in 1994

A man who killed a  gas station attendant in front of the worker's eight-year-old stepdaughter in 1994 was executed in Missouri in the early hours of this morning.

Leon Taylor, 56, was sentenced to death through lethal injection for the murder of Robert Newton, who was shot in the head during a gas station robbery in Independence. Taylor also tried to kill Newton's young stepdaughter, but the gun jammed.

In a final statement, Taylor apologized to Newton's family because 'our lives had to entwine so tragically' and thanked his family for their support and love.

'I am also sorry to have brought all of you to this point in my life to witness this and/or participate,' Taylor said. 'Stay strong and keep your heads to the sky.' 

His last meal consisted of eggs, bacon, doughnuts and an orange drink. Department of Corrections spokesman Mike O'Connell said Taylor later turned down the sedative Valium and the sedative midazolam.

The convicted killer  could be seen in the execution chamber at Bonne Terre state prison talking to family members through the glass in an adjacent room, with his body covered by a white sheet.

Once the state started injecting 5 grams of pentobarbital, his chest heaved for several seconds then stopped. His jaw went slack and he displayed no other movement for the rest of the process.

Four of Taylor's family members sat in a room to his left and looked on without reaction as the drug killed Taylor in about eight minutes. 

Speaking after the execution, Mr Newton's brother, Dennis Smith, noted that it had been about 7,500 days since the killing and said the family has missed him every one of them.

He described his brother as a hard worker, generous and with a memorable laugh. At times, Mr Smith paused to compose himself as tears rolled down his cheeks.

'It would just take a coward to want to hurt someone like him,' he said.

According to court records, Taylor had decided to rob the gas station with his half brother and half sister  on April 14, 1994. He entered the store, drew a gun and told Newton, 53, to put $400 in a money bag. 

The half brother, Willie Owens, then took the money to the car, while Taylor ordered Mr Newton and the young girl to a back room. 

Mr Newton pleaded not to be killed in front of the little girl, but Taylor shot him in the head and then tried to kill the child. But the gun jammed, so Taylor locked her in the room and the trio drove away.

'She had the gun turned on her,' said Michael Hunt, an assistant Jackson County prosecutor who worked on the case. 'It didn't fire. If it had fired, we'd have had a double homicide.'

He added that the child's testimony at trial was pivotal in the death sentence.

'You can imagine what a horrible crime this was, but when you see it coming out of a young person like that, it was hard to listen to,' Mr Hunt said.

Taylor was arrested a week after the crime when police responded to a tips hotline call.

His execution is the ninth in Missouri this year, meaning 2014 currently ties with 1999 for having the most executions in a year in the state.

At a time when executions have gone awry in Oklahoma, Ohio and Arizona, Taylor's death occurred without any visible complications with the drug or equipment.

Taylor's fate was sealed Tuesday when Governor Jay Nixon declined to grant clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down his appeal. 

Court appeals claimed the death penalty for Taylor was unfair for several reasons.

The original jury deadlocked and a judge sentenced him to death. When that was thrown out, an all-white jury gave Taylor, who was black, the death sentence.

In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that only a jury could impose a death sentence. 

Taylor's lawyers contended that a Missouri Supreme Court ruling after the U.S. Supreme Court decision led the state to commute at least 10 other death sentences for inmates sentenced by a judge to life in prison - everyone except Taylor.

Attorney Elizabeth Carlyle said Taylor essentially was penalized for successfully appealing his first conviction.

The clemency request to Governor Nixon said Taylor turned his life around in prison, becoming a devout Christian who helped other prisoners. 

The petition also cited abuse Taylor suffered as a child, saying his mother began giving him alcohol when he was five and that he later became addicted to alcohol and drugs.
