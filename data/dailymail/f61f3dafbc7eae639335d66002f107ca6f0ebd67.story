Murdoch: 'The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing'

The Daily, Rupert Murdoch’s struggling iPad-only newspaper, is to close after less than two years in the latest costly Internet disaster for the media tycoon.

News Corporation said that the paper would publish its last edition on December 15 with staff redundancies expected.

According to the New York Times, The Daily was losing around $30m a year, meaning that over its two year lifespan it will have cost Murdoch at least $60million.

Short lifespan: CEO Rupert Murdoch sits on stage with The Daily editor Jesse Angelo, right, and Eddy Cue, VP of Internet Services at Apple, for the launch of his new online newspaper on February 2, 2011

Its editor Jesse Angelo will become 
the publisher of the New York Post, which is also owned by the company, 
with some journalists moving to the paper too.

The closure will be a huge embarrassment to Murdoch, for whom The Daily was one of his pet projects.

In a statement, he admitted the paper did not get enough readers and it was hemorrhaging money from the off too.

In
 its second quarter in business, The Daily reported losses of $10 
million and just four months ago it shed a third of its staff - around 
50 employees.

Pioneering: Critics said that even though it was the first iPad-only newspaper in the world, it would not work in a world where consumers expected their news on the Internet for free

Critics said that even though it was the first iPad-only newspaper in the world, it would not work in a world where consumers expected their news on the Internet for free.

Subscriptions for The Daily were 99c per week or $39.99 annually.

The announcement about The Daily was slipped out in a press release detailing the new structure of News Corps as it's splits into two.

It includes the appointment of Wall Street Journal editor Robert Thomson to the post of CEO of News Corp’s new publishing arm.

The new entity was set up in the wake of
 the phone hacking scandal in which journalists working for the now 
shuttered British tabloid the News of the World, which was owned by News
 Corp, accessed voicemails of a 13-year-old girl who had been abducted 
and killed.

Over: The closure of The Daily, which will print its last edition on December 15, will be a huge embarrassment to Murdoch, for whom The Daily was one of his pet projects

In a statement, News Corporation said that The Daily brand would live on in ‘other channels’ but did not elaborate.

Murdoch said: ‘From its launch, The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing and an amazing vehicle for innovation.

‘Unfortunately, our experience was that we could not find a large enough audience quickly enough to convince us the business model was sustainable in the long-term.’

Murdoch has yet to make any further comment on his Twitter feed but the closure of The Daily is another chapter in his inglorious history when it comes to forays in the Internet.

He bought MySpace, the social networking site for $580m and sold it just six years later for $35m having admitted that he ‘screwed up’ with the purchase.

Murdoch’s pay wall for The Times of London has also led to traffic collapsing but he refuses to axe it.

At
its launch in February last year, News Corp touted The Daily as its ‘digital
savoir’ and Murdoch claimed it would be template for web-based journalism in
the future.

It
was available as an app which users downloaded on their iPad with a viewer
which enabled them to flick through the 100 pages.

Among
the other features which were touted were 360-degree photographs and a
‘carousel’ which let readers view pages more easily.

Some
100 journalists were taken on for the publication which cost $30m to set up and
$500,000 a week to run.

As
he unveiled the first edition, Murdoch said: ‘New times demand new journalism…
and a new service edited and designed specifically for new devices.

‘Our
challenge is to take the best of traditional journalism…and combine it with the
best of contemporary technology’.

By
July this year however the writing was on the wall and The Daily had a mere
100,000 subscribers and 250,000 unique users each month.
