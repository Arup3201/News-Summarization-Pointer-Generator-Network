The Wallabies staff member at the centre of the Kurtley Beale investigation has reportedly quit her role with the Australian Rugby Union.

Wallabies business manager Di Patston resigned on Friday, according to a Fairfax Media report on Saturday.

Patston was thrust into the spotlight following an alleged midair confrontation with Beale between South Africa and Argentina, after which coach Ewen McKenzie abandoned a Wallabies training session in Buenos Aires to drive his distressed business manager to the airport so she could make an early dash home.

Patston has been on indefinite sick leave ever since.

This comes after reports of Beale being involved in a verbal altercation with the Wallabies staff member while travelling from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo - the day after the side's 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town nearly two weeks ago.

Beale, 25, is also under investigation for allegedly sending offensive text messages about Patson back in June.

An ARU spokeswoman confirmed Patston had quit due to stress relating to recent events Fairfax Media reports.

Beale is facing the axe, not only over the alleged midair incident but also over allegations he circulated offensive text messages about Patston.

Rumours have suggested McKenzie is in a relationship with Patston, who he previously worked with at the Queensland Reds and has since employed to tour with the Wallabies on the road.

It's believed some players had become disillusioned by Patston's role in the team and McKenzie's reasons for hiring her.

McKenzie hit back on Friday, insisting his relationship with Patston has always been professional and therefore not compromising his position as coach.

'I've got a professional relationship with her. And I refute (suggestions of an intimate relationship). There are people out there and that there's some sort of campaign to impugn that's (not) the situation,' McKenzie said.
