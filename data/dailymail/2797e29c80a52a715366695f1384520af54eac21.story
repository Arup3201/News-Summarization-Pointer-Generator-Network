Arsene Wenger delivered a hymn of praise to Mesut Ozil, comparing the midfielder to a master musician in the way he times his passes and predicting he will return to his best this season.

The Arsenal boss claimed that Ozil, who played every game in Germany’s World Cup-winning campaign, is unfairly criticised and does not get enough credit for his achievements.

‘People are very harsh with Ozil because he’s a player who’s always very easy on his play,’ said Wenger. ‘But when you watch the game again the next day you see what a player he is.

Going nowhere fast: Ozil has yet to make a real impact at Arsenal since his move from Real Madrid last year

‘Everything he does is intelligent. The timing of everything he does is absolutely perfect. You never catch him giving the ball too late. The number of players you catch giving the ball too late is unbelievable. He’s like a guy who plays the music, the timing of what he does is perfect, you don’t get many players like that. He will never be a tackler.’

Wenger added: ‘He is not getting enough praise. He came back as a World Cup winner. He got back (to Arsenal) on August 11 and he has already played two games, so after three or four weeks he will be at his best again.’

Ozil, 25, was bought from Real Madrid for £42.5million a year ago, making him the most expensive export in German football history and Arsenal’s biggest ever signing.

Prospect: Ozil was a rising star in La Liga with Madrid before the £42.5m deal which brought him to Arsenal

But his languid style has given rise to accusations of laziness, even in his homeland where former Germany star Paul Breitner called for him to be dropped before the World Cup semi-final against Brazil because he ‘does nothing but walk around the pitch’.

There have been calls for Wenger to bolster his squad in the final days of the transfer window, particularly up front where injured Olivier Giroud will be unavailable until at least January.

While he said he would ‘remain alert’ until the final seconds of the window, Wenger believes his squad is strong enough without more additions. He also claimed bringing in too many players can deny youngsters a chance to break through.

‘If you always buy, you can never give a chance to a player,’ he said. ‘Take the example of Calum Chambers. Calum played centre back because I gave him the chance. If I had bought four centre backs already I would never have played him.’
