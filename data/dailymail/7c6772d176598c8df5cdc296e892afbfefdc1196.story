A grandfather held a Filipina woman in near-seclusion as she worked as a maid, landscaper, nanny and cook at his family's multiple properties for a pitiful wage, prosecutors have claimed.

Romulo 'Ome' Almeda Sr., 73, has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case but now faces five years of federal supervision for employing the immigrant worker unlawfully.

Almeda, who lives in Magnolia, Seattle, allegedly paid the woman just $400 a month while she worked for his family for four years - shorting her of $90,500 that he has now paid her in back wages.

Authorities began investigating Almeda, a married grandfather and retired electrical engineer, after the unidentified woman managed to escape the family with the help of a local pastor.

Held in seclusion: A Filipina woman worked as a maid, gardener, cook and nanny for a family for just $400 a month. She was ferried between their homes  (one is pictured) in Washington and California

Almeda moved to the U.S. after meeting a client at her $6-a-day manicurist job in the Philippines who told her they could get her better-paying work in the U.S, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported.

She obtained a visitor's visa and flew to Seattle to work for Almeda - but it was far from the better life she'd imagined, prosecutors said.

In the subsequent years, she lived in near-seclusion as she worked 12 to 16 hours a day for $400 a month - far below the minimum wage. She sent it all but $50 to $100 back to the Philippines.

She would look after the family's children, carry out gardening, laundry and cleaning, and cook the family's meals, prosecutors said.

She was ferried between the family's Washington and California homes - never being given a choice about when she would be moved.

As she did not hold a valid visa, the 
woman was unable to leave the homes, and could not even attend church in
 case she would be seen and deported, prosecutors said.

Fears: Another of the family's Seattle properties is pictured. The woman was only able to escape the family after her family members contacted a local pastor, who removed her from the home in 2009

The woman was eventually able to tell her family about her dire living situation and her sister contacted another Filipino family in Seattle, who got in touch with a local pastor.

The pastor helped remove the woman from the home in April 2009.

Almeda was arrested - but he said he believed he was simply helping the woman and her family.

'At the time, I thought I was simply offering my home and extra money to someone who had no place to go,' Almeda said in a letter to the court. 'I now know what I did was wrong and unlawful.'

He was charged in September and reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. He has not been jailed and is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday.
