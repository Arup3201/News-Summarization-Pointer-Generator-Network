Revealed: An anonymous do-gooder traveling the country giving servers incredibly generous tips has been outed as multimillionaire former PayPal Vice President Jack Selby, pictured

An anonymous do-gooder traveling the country giving servers incredibly generous tips is reportedly multimillionaire former PayPal Vice President Jack Selby.

According to ValleyWag, the 39-year-old businessman, who appears to be single, has handed out more than $50,000 in tips in the past three months at cafes and clubs from Michigan to California under the name 'Tipsforjesus.'

Each kind gesture has been documented on the Instagram feed Tipsforjesus, which has the tagline, 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.'

Selby was among a small group of alumni who made an astronomical fortune at PayPal, and since leaving the firm has dabbled in film production, venture capitalism and now, according to his Facebook, he's opened a drycleaning business.

While he hasn't officially revealed himself anywhere since the story went viral, he posted a link to an article about one generous gratuity on his page. And his Facebook friends appear to be in on the charitable scheme.

One, Anne Woolway, commented: 'Do we win if we know whom is behind tipsforjesus?'

Another, Rob Hughes, added: 'and the mystery tipper strikes again...'

He also owns homes in all the states where tips were received, including multiple residences in Arizona and California.  Last year, Selby started a company Incognito Pictures with the aim to make movies for a budget of $10 million or less. Selby secured $50 million in financing for the project and entered into a long-term distribution deal with The Weinstein Company.

Tipsforjesus has left a trail of extremely happy servers across the country after dropping the ridiculously generous tips.

Selby earned a reputation for leaving extremely generous tips and Instagram-ing photos to prove it such as this one with a waitress who has just received $5,000

Little was known about Tipsforjesus bar an Instagram page until his identity was revealed Wednesday

Until now, little was known about the
mystery money man bar the Instagram page where a series of photographs 
have been posted since September of happy servers and receipts bearing 
gratuities with up to five figures.

Adding
up all the tips posted so far, Tips4jesus has handed out over $54,000 
to servers across the country in establishments including Tio's Mexican 
Cafe in Ann Arbor, the Paris Club in Chicago and the Hungry Cat in Los 
Angeles.

To begin with many people – especially waiters and waitresses - questioned the authenticity of the mega-tips which have so far ranged in size from $500 to $10,000.

But one lucky recipient came come forward to confirm that Tips4jesus is the real deal.

Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, who was lucky enough to pick up a $7,000 tip for a $215 bar tab. 

Selby was also generous in Phoenix at the restaurant Crudo

Schulz recently confirmed to local blog 
Damn Arbor that the tip was real and that he served the mysterious 
Tip4jesus in September when he and his entourage were in town for the 
Notre Dame versus Michigan game.

According to Schulz, the Tips4jesus crew found themselves at his bar at 1:45am after a couple of other places had turned them away.

He described Tips4jesus as friendly, polite, nice and a pleasure to serve and that he was told he would be taken care of the staff at the end of the night.

Schultz had expectations that perhaps a $50 tip might be in the offing, but was flabbergasted when Tips4jesus reached for his black American Express card and tipped an amazing $7,000.

A black AMEX card was a sure sign that the customer was going to be good for massive tip as the exclusive card is by invitation only and
the average cardholder has $16.3 million in assets and a household 
income of $1.3 million.

It's every server's dream to have some super generous customer leave an enormous tip for a job well done and one bartender came forward to confirm that Tipsforjesus was the real deal

At Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tipsforjesus, or Selby, left a $10,000 tip - over two receipts - which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud

According to Schultz, Tips4jesus promised him that the amount was 100 per cent legit and he was good for the amount. He even returned the next day to buy some T-shirts and take the picture that appears on the Instagram account.

After the tip cleared Schultz very generously distributed the money amongst the staff who worked that night, in addition to at least one employee who had the night off. 

But not everyone has been so fortunate with getting their windfall.

At a bar called Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tips4jesus left a $10,000 which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud, reports the South Bend Tribune.

When the server noted that the tip didn't go through, Tips4jesus replied with a vow to ensure that the charge had been approved and followed that up with a photo of the Amex statement to prove it.

Tips4jesus' further offered to help the server, posting, 'Nobody is going to ruin the good were trying to do.'
