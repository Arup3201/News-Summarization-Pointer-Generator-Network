Rory McIlroy scored two birdies on the par four ninth at Hoylake - as he managed to negotiate the hole in just three shots despite the presence of a local pheasant.

The Open Championship leader holed his third consecutive birdie to move to eight under par and further extend his overnight lead during the second round.

But before he could take his putt a wild pheasant roamed on to the green at the ninth and darted towards the Northern Irishman's ball, then exited at the other side.

Two for the price of one: Rory McIlroy looks on as a pheasant runs across the putting surface on the ninth green during the second round of The Open at Hoylake

Double birdie: Rory McIlroy lines up to take his putt on the ninth hole at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club as a pheasant runs across the green

Bemused: McIlroy looks on slightly confused but is undeterred by the presence of the wild pheasant on the green and continues to study his putting line

Circling: McIlroy walks around to check the green surface on the other side while the pheasant begins to move around the hole and towards his ball

Looking on: McIlroy chuckles as the pheasant continues to make its way across the putting surface and towards the far side of the green

Flying away: The pheasant exits the putting surface at the far side of the hole as McIlroy continues to concentrate on his putt and not on the bird itself

And the double major winner was unperturbed as he laughed off the incident and was ice cool as he rolled in a 10-footer for birdie.

McIlroy is looking to move three-quarters of the way towards a career Grand Slam of majors at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake.

He won the 2011 US Open and the 2012 PGA Championship but is yet to win the US Masters or the British Open.

Smirk: McIlroy is all smiles as he watches the pheasant plod across the green and before he moves on to sink his third birdie in as many holes to reach eight under par
