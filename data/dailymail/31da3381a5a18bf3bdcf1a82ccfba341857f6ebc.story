Gunmen have shot dead the prosecutor investigating the murder of Pakistan's ex-leader Benazir Bhutto.

The men on a motorcycle killed Chaudhry Zulfikar as he left his home and headed to a hearing in the case.

Chaudhry Zulfikar was at the helm of a number of highly controversial cases, including the 2007 Bhutto assassination in which Musharraf is accused of involvement.

He was also prosecuting militants linked to the 2008 terror attack in the Indian city of Mumbai.

Zulfikar was on his way to a court in
Islamabad when gunmen fired at him from a taxi, hitting him in the 
head, shoulder and chest, said police officer Mohammed Ishaq.

Zulfikar then lost control of his car, which hit a woman passer-by and killed her, said another police officer, Mohammed Rafiq.

Zulfikar's guard, Farman Ali, returned fire and is believed to have wounded at least one of the attackers, Rafiq said. Ali also was injured in the attack.

Police official Yasin Farooq said the
attackers fled after killing Zulfikar, and that a massive search has 
been launched to find them.

Murder: Zulfikar, the prosecutor investigating the 2007 assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, one of the most shocking events in Pakistan's turbulent history, was shot dead on Friday

A motive for the killing was unclear,
but Zulfikar's involvement in the two particularly high-profile cases 
will likely be scrutinized closely.

Government prosecutors have accused 
Musharraf of being involved in the Bhutto assassination and not 
providing enough security to Pakistan's first female prime minister. 
Musharraf, who was in power when was killed, has denied the allegations.
At the time of the attack, he blamed the assassination on the Pakistani
Taliban.

The Bhutto case has lingered for 
years in the Pakistani court system. A number of alleged assailants are 
on trial but no one has been convicted. The case burst into the 
headlines when Musharraf returned in March after four years in exile.

Zulfikar was also the government's 
lead prosecutor in a case related to the 2008 terrorist attack on the 
Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people.

The attack was blamed on the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba.

Pakistan has put seven men on trial 
on charges they assisted in the Mumbai siege, but the trial has made 
little progress. India has criticized Pakistan for not doing more to 
crack down on the militants blamed for the attack. Hafiz Saeed, the head
of a group believed to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba, remains free, 
and many believe he enjoys the protection of the government.

Lashkar-e-Taiba was founded years ago
with the help of Pakistani intelligence to put pressure on India over 
the disputed territory of Kashmir.

Musharraf returned to Pakistan to 
make a political comeback despite Taliban death threats and a raft of 
legal cases against him. But his fortunes have gone from bad to worse 
since he arrived.

Judges barred him from running in the
May 11 parliamentary election not long after he arrived because of his 
actions while in power.

A court in the northwestern city of 
Peshawar went further this week and banned Musharraf from running for 
public office for the rest of his life - a ruling the former military 
strongman plans to appeal.

Musharraf is currently under house 
arrest on the outskirts of Islamabad in connection with several cases 
against him, including the Bhutto case. He also faces allegations of 
treason before the Supreme Court.

Zulfikar was headed to a hearing 
related to Musharraf and the Bhutto case at a court in Rawalpindi, next 
to Islamabad, when he was killed, said Ishaq, the police officer.

Musharraf seized power in a military 
coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and ruled for nearly a 
decade until he was forced to step down in 2008 because of growing 
discontent with his rule.

Though Pakistan has experienced 
repeated violence, it's rare for such an attack to happen in the 
capital, which is home to high-ranking government and military 
officials, diplomats and international aid workers.

Friday's killing comes at a sensitive time for Pakistan, which is preparing for nationwide elections on May 11.

The vote will mark the first time 
that an elected civilian government has fulfilled its term and handed 
off power to another civilian government in the country.

Pakistan has experienced three coups, including the one led by Musharraf in 1999. President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the prosecutor's killing and called for a thorough investigation.
