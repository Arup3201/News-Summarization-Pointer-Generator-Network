It has taken the place of Woolworths as the general store of choice if you want anything from batteries and cake tins to sweets and garden tools at a bargain price.

But now Poundland has branched out into the world of jewellery – and yes, each item really does cost £1.

The range is called Purple Ivy and includes a remarkable 82 pieces, including necklaces, rings, bracelets, bangles, brooches and earrings.

There are six collections under the labels Lady, Girl Next Door, Vintage Colour, Mysterious, Nature and Rustic Animals.

Chief executive Jim McCarthy says he wants Poundland, which has made a virtue of the fact that its products cost only £1, to become a force in high street jewellery.

He believes shoppers will be happy to wear Poundland jewellery, saying: ‘Behavioural changes of shoppers are benefiting the value sector. Value is now absolutely a badge of honour for customers across the spectrum.’

He pointed out that 22 per cent of Poundland’s customers are now from the more affluent ‘AB’ demographic.

Pretty things for a pound a piece: A £1 'gold' chain and a charm bracelet - also only a quid 

A spokesman announced the arrival of Purple Ivy by saying: ‘Diamonds are a girl’s best friend and we all like to feel glamorous when dressing up. Whether it’s for a night out or a day at the office, accessorising an outfit need not cost a fortune. The new jewellery range is for people on a budget who still want to look great.’

The store says its Lady range includes pearls and crystals ‘for a classy, elegant look’. It adds: ‘These pieces complement smart and evening dresses really well.’ The Girl Next Door look is presented as a dainty collection of pieces including bows and roses, while the Vintage items include enamel-effect bracelets and rings, and Mysterious is a modern collection of simple silver and black items.

The Nature pieces are described as ‘subtle’ and suitable for those with a ‘peaceful and serene persona’. The Rustic Animals collection is defined by a bronze gold-effect colour scheme, which is deliberately designed to give an antique appearance, featuring stylised representations of creatures.

Initial responses on Poundland’s Facebook page have been positive, with shoppers describing some of the items as ‘beautiful’ and ‘gorgeous’. An owl necklace has been particularly popular.

The company has succeeded by overcoming a middle-class prejudice that saw some communities launch campaigns to keep the chain out of their high streets.

Its tactics have revolved around launching ranges that are specifically designed to appeal to a more upmarket shopper, things such as gardening gloves and grow-your-own seeds.

A Jane Asher bakery range has also sold in huge quantities on the back of the home baking revival triggered by the BBC’s Great British Bake Off competition. Since launching in April, sales have been almost double the predicted figures with the result that the range has been expanded to more than 50 items.

The chain recently reported that sales have hit almost £1billion a year amid the biggest change in shopping habits in 60 years.

The growth came on the back of the opening of 60 more stores, taking the total to 528, while it plans to expand the empire further with a target of some 1,000 outlets.

The retailer, which is based in the West Midlands and opened its first store in Burton-on-Trent in 1990, is also looking overseas. It has more than 30 shops under the Dealz brand in Ireland and has started opening shops in Spain.
