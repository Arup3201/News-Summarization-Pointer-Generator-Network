A woman claims that hypnosis revealed she shot dead a farmer who she believes raped her - nearly 40 years ago.

Janet Holt, 64, has been questioned by police over her claim that she had buried the memories of the killing until she went for therapy decades later.

Her business partner Fred Handford, then 56, vanished in 1976. Despite a huge police search he was never found.

Janet Holt claims hypnosis revealed that she shot and killed farmer Fred Handford after he raped her in 1976

The body of Fred Handford, pictured on Ball Beard Farm in 1968, has never been found

For more than 30 years Miss Holt, who worked with him at Ball Beard farm in Buxton, Derbyshire, had no clue what happened to him.

But she had repeated unexplained nightmares about Mr Handford and underwent therapy to see if there was something locked deep in her mind.

Miss Holt said the recollection was terrifyingly clear - she shot Fred after he twice raped her, then put his body in a wheelbarrow and buried him on their farm.

Police arrested and interviewed her in 2011 after she went to officers and told them where she believed she buried the body.

But after extensive searches of the 50-acre farm, he was never found and she was released.

The case remains open.

Miss Holt said: 'There are no words that I can use to describe how I felt when I realised what I had done.

'Then suddenly there it was, stored in my own memory for 34 years. I killed Fred Handford. I was stunned.

'I couldn't believe I'd killed someone, I never would have thought I was capable of such a thing.

'I knew exactly what I had to do so I handed myself in to the police. I believe he is there and that the police just haven't found him.

'Obviously I don't want to go to prison but justice would have to take its course. I want Fred's remains found.'

Miss Holt was 26 at the time of Mr Handford's disappearance. She had worked on the farm since she was 14 and says he was like a father to her.

One morning, she woke up to find that he was missing and she had no memory of the past four days.

She said: 'I knew something was wrong when I saw my muddy wellington boots by my bed, as I would never have dragged all that mud through the house.

'I felt delirious and when I found out Fred was missing I was beside myself wondering where he had gone.

'But never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd have hurt him. I took my mother to the farm with me. Fred was nowhere to be seen.

'I called his name and looked for him in the farmhouse.

'It was unlike Fred to leave the farm apart from when he visited his sister. So, I called her and she said he wasn't there.

'My mother and I waited a few hours for Fred to return but after a while we became worried and we called the police.'

Fred Handford was like a father to Janet Holt, she said

Janet Holt had worked on the farm for 12 years before Mr Handford vanished in 1976

Mr Handford was officially declared missing. Miss Holt was interviewed by police but released without charge.

She said: 'Those four blank days always bothered me but I never thought I had anything to do with Fred's disappearance.

'The nightmares I had were extremely vivid and utterly terrifying. It got to the point where they were causing me to be depressed.

'I never saw Fred in the dreams but I often thought of him and wondered about what had happened to him.'

Miss Holt then heard of Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing, a form of psychotherapy called that is used to bring back memories and eliminate trauma.

A 1976 report on the story in the Manchester Evening News detailed the hunt for Mr Handford, described as 5ft 10in, slim, with a scar on the right temple. Neighbouring farmers told the paper that he never went anywhere without his horse and cart, dog and hat, which had been left behind

Another newspaper report described how rescuers searched the nearby moorland for Mr Handford

She said: 'I went to a psychologist's office. She talked me through the therapy, which involved me trying to relive the lost four days of my life and moving my eyes from side to side to stimulate the memories.'

Miss Holt said remembered everything after four hours of intense therapy.

She said: 'I remembered that four days before his disappearance, Fred had raped me twice. I had clear visions of the attack, and how I was preparing to leave the farm for good.

'For days I ignored Fred and never went back to the farm. I didn't want to see him.

'But one afternoon after the attack I walked to the nearby stables to feed my ponies and found a note pinned to the door.

Janet Holt has written The Stranger In My Life about her experiences

'It read, "I'm sorry. Please look after the animals".

'I remembered clutching the note and panicking, thinking that Fred may have killed himself because of the guilt of raping me.

'That night I was in such a state of upset and panic. I didn't know what to do with myself.

'The next morning I woke up and went to the farmhouse.

'When I got there Fred was standing in the kitchen and laughing, saying, "I knew that note would get you here".

'He told me to sit down at the kitchen table, and he turned his back to me to put the kettle on. I was petrified thinking he was going to rape me again.

'Out of the corner of my eye I saw Fred's shotgun propped up against the wall.

'Fred was always telling me not to touch the gun because it was loaded.

'Without thinking I grabbed hold of it.

'I took aim at Fred whilst he still had his back to me and I shot him once in the back.

'It was the oddest feeling. I had mourned for my friend for more than 30 years without knowing that actually he was a rapist and I was a killer.

'I wished I had remembered at the time and confessed and got on with my life.

'The nightmares and uncertainty have been horrendous.'

Miss Holt has written a book - The Stranger In My Life - about her experiences.
