In search of the perfect Christmas party outfit this December? As always, Topshop has it covered.

The high-street fashion behemoth has finally unveiled its 2013 Holiday Collection, and there are enough sequins, sparkles and cosy furs to help you dazzle from desk to dance floor.

Among the range of limited edition dresses you'll find daring short- and glamorous floor-length designs in eye-catching Christmassy golds and silvers, often with lace embellishment.

It's here! Topshop has unveiled its 2013 Christmas Holiday collection and it is packed with furs, sequins and daring dresses (Limited edition printed sequin maxi, £140)

If you're looking to embrace a more casual look, there are cool camis with matching midi-skirts, a black jumpsuit, and a green lurex jacquard blazer that will inject glamour into any outfit.

For women looking to make a sartorial statement, Topshop's seasonal line also includes a range of sequin pencil skirts and tops, a sleeveless pearl bralet and gold embellished trousers. 

As for shoes, there are strappy 
stilettos with animal prints and glitter, red satin and gold 
glitter court shoes, and even some chunky block heels topped with pretty pom poms.

Accessories stay true to the Christmas theme, and clutches come with heavy doses of diamante, sequin and metallic finishes.

Something for everyone: From sexy slip dresses (£125) to sophisticated suit jackets, the Topshop Christmas range caters for everyone, whether you're looking for something glamorous or casual

All that glitters: The range is heavy on the sequins and dresses come in festive colours such as red, green and gold (dress, £68)

From desk to dance floor: Whether you're after cutaway dresses (£150) with gold detailing, or clean cut trouser suits and chunky heels topped with fluffy pom poms, Topshop has the party season covered

Speaking about the seasonal offering, celebrity stylist Jade Elliott said: 'Topshop's new collection is so good it's almost got me smiling about the miserable weather.

'Topshop is my high street fashion favourite, and this festive collection ticks all the fashion boxes this season.

'From glittery party dresses to faux fur jackets,- this on-trend collection is to die for.

'Whether you're looking for fashion's hottest trends straight from the catwalk or just some traditional Christmas sparkle, you're sure to find it at Topshop. But don't hang around; this collection is so good it's sure to sell out!'

Quirky: More casual pieces include a billowy £48 black jumpsuit, left, or a green velvet trouser suit, right

Gold rush: Gold is a key theme in the range, and accessories come in the form of animal print clutches and strappy stilettos (lurex gold all-in-one £38)

The Christmas Holiday Collection ranges in price from £55 to £237, and is in store and online now.
