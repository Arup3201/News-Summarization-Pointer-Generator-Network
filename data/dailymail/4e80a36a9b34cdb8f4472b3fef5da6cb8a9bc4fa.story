In its heyday it attracted two million visitors a year.

But the iconic amusement park at the seaside resort of Margate shut in 2006 as crowds ebbed away, enticed by more glamorous locations.

The seafront site has been an amusement park in one form or another since 1874 when 'Lord' George Sanger opened his menagerie at the 'Hall by the Sea'.

Not so scenic: The rollercoaster was damaged in a fire in 2008 and stands neglected and partially dismantled

In need of a makeover: Although home to Britain's oldest rollercoaster Dreamland could not maintain its charm for visitors and closed in 2006

Decline: the cinema - first looking faded and then in scaffolding - would be restored in the second phase of the costly redevelopment 

Revival: The Dreamland Trust has been granted £10m from the government's SeaChange fund to re-open Dreamland as heritage-themed amusement park

Unloved: The 16-acre site includes a theme park, amusements, a 2,200 seat cinema and a shopping arcade that dominates Margate's seafront

Sanger's grade II-listed menagerie cages are believed to be the last of their kind remaining.

The site contains the UK's oldest 
rollercoaster, a grade II*-listed structure from 1920 called the Scenic 
Railway, and a 2,200-seat grade II* listed cinema building developed in 
1935.

The Scenic Railway rollercoaster today stands neglected and partially dismantled in the 
ruins of the old park after it was damaged by a fire in 2008.

Grim: One of Britain's premier seaside destinations, Margate is down-at-heel and waiting for redevelopment at the moment

Derelict: Designer Wayne Hemingway said the restored park would be for people of all ages to enjoy when it hopefully opens next year

However, there are already signs that Margate's fortunes are looking up.

Of all the holiday resorts in the world, Margate 
reached seventh place in the Rough Guide book’s 'must see' 
destinations for 2013.

The Turner Contemporary art gallery on the seafront has already brought in almost a million visitors since it opened just over two years ago. There are also new shops and boutique hotels, particularly near the attractive Old Town.

Mary Portas took on the town's 
shop-owners and tried to breathe new life into the town's retail sector 
for her show Mary, Queen of Shops.

Wayne Hemingway, the creative force 
behind the Dreamland Trust, says that if their legal battle is 
successful the first phase of renovations will cost some £10 million.

Wasn't it fun: the Scenic Railway, the world's first rollercoaster, opened in 1920 but today stands delapidated

Innocent age: Resorts such as Margate have lost out as tourists have travelled to more glamorous and warmer locations

Downward slide: Dreamland's fortunes had been declining for years before the site's closure in 2006

That will include restoring the Scenic Railway, the historic rides collections and the original menagerie cages.

A second phase will include restoring the iconic 2,000-capacity cinema auditorium.

The campaigners have their work cut out, especially as Tesco is seeking planning permission for a supermarket next door to Dreamland, potentially spoiling the heritage feel of the site.
