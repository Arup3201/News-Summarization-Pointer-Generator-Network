A 38-year-old mother has been arrested on suspicion of overlaying after her baby twin girl was found dead today.

The woman had earlier been seen in a distressed state before emergency services arrived at her house at 9.30am this morning in Chesham, Buckinghamshire.

Thames Valley Police officers had been called to reports of a dead baby thought to be just weeks old, and were examining the family home this afternoon following the 'unexplained death'. 

Overlaying is suffocating a child under three years while in bed with them when intoxicated.

The baby was discovered by neighbour 
Leigh Furness, who told how she rushed to the flat above after hearing 
screaming, and found the dead child before calling 999.

Miss
 Furness, who lives in a flat below, said she heard shouting from above 
in the morning and rushed upstairs to discover the horrifying scene 
after finding the door to the woman's flat was open.

She
 said: ‘It was the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. I'm in total
 shock. I heard the noise this morning, I went in there and the baby was
 dead.’

Miss Furness 
confirmed the girl had a twin brother, both of whom were just a few 
weeks old. She said their mother was in the flat at the time and was in a
 distressed state.

A police spokesman said this afternoon
 just after 4.30pm: ‘Thames Valley Police have arrested a 38-year-old 
woman on suspicion of overlaying in connection with the unexplained 
death of a baby.

'We're currently working to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the baby's death.'

Liberal Democrat town councillor Alison Pirouet, 57, who lives near the home, said earlier: ‘It's a
 very serious incident. An ambulance arrived and has since gone. The 
police are still here.

‘The 
paramedics have gone now too. I believe there was a young family living 
there. My neighbour saw a baby being taken out and put in the ambulance.
 The paramedics took it away.

‘A
 young woman and another woman were with the paramedics. The police are 
still here. There are four police cars. It's a serious incident 
concerning the young family. My thoughts go out to them.’

She added: ‘There’s no problem, everybody's going about about their lives as they normally would.’

Her
 husband Richard, 60, said: ‘I heard the police cars and the helicopter 
and it escalated from there. We keep ourselves to ourselves down this 
road. It's a really nice area.’

Neighbours said that up to six police cars were at the scene this morning and an air ambulance was also in attendance.

Officers
 remained at the scene this afternoon, with a lone police car sat on the
 road outside the two-storey building. Police were taking witness 
statements from neighbours in nearby flats.

The woman and baby are believed to have lived in one of the upstairs flats of the building, which is split into blocks of four.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘There's a girl in there with a baby that is about eight months, and another one who has a couple of kids, one of which is only a few weeks old.’

The building where the incident happened contains eight flats and is separated from the nearby homes by a small green.

A South Central Ambulance spokesman said that the baby was taken away in a 'life-threatening condition' before being pronounced dead at hospital.

Earlier, there was confusion over the mother's condition. However, the spokesman added later that the mother accompanied the baby to hospital, but was not admitted for treatment.

Mother-of-two Diane Thornton said on Twitter: 'So awful, a baby has been found dead in Chesham just up the road from us. I only walked up there today to go to the nursery.'

A post mortem examination was expected to take place on the dead child in due course and an inquest opened and adjourned.

The
 road on which the incident happened has an average house price of 
£200,000 and is located about 30 miles north-west of Central London.
