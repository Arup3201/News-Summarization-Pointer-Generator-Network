Keir Starmer said the idea that women were regularly crying rape when none had in fact taken place was 'damaging' the cause of justice

Rape and domestic violence are not being investigated properly by police because of a ‘misplaced belief’ that false allegations are rife, the Director of Public Prosecutions has warned.

Keir Starmer said the idea that women were regularly crying rape when none had in fact taken place was ‘damaging’ the cause of justice.

A study published today by the Crown Prosecution Service shows only a handful of false allegations of rape were made in 2011 and 2012.

Mr Starmer said: ‘Because people recognise the devastating effect of false allegations and because they perceive there to be more false allegations than this report would suggest there are, arguably they adopt a cautious approach.

‘That can lead to injustice for victims.’

The study reveals that over a 17-month period between January 2011 and May 2012 – when all false allegation cases were referred to the DPP – there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape, but only 35 for making false allegations of rape.

Likewise, there were 111,891 prosecutions for domestic violence, but only six for making false allegations of domestic violence.

A further three people were charged with making false allegations of both rape and domestic violence.

Furthermore, the study found that a significant number of the false allegation cases involved ‘young, often vulnerable people, and sometimes even children’.

Around half were brought forward by people aged 21 and under, with some involving people with mental health difficulties.

‘From the cases we have analysed, the indication is that it is extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice,’ Mr Starmer added.

‘It is within this context that the issue should be viewed, so that myths and stereotypes around these cases are not able to take hold.’

A report into Jimmy Savile says the shamed BBC star's sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as 1964 if police had not dismissed his victims' complaints and mishandled evidence

Earlier this week a separate report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary showed how police mishandled allegations against Jimmy Savile – in many cases because they did not believe the reports of his victims.

The report concluded the shamed BBC star’s sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as 1964 if police had not dismissed his victims’ complaints and mishandled evidence.

The latest report by the CPS is the first of its kind. It is part of a wider programme to improve the agency’s handling of cases involving violence against women and girls.

In the foreword to the report, Mr Starmer writes that victims of rape and domestic violence ‘must not be deterred from reporting the abuse they have suffered’ by popular misconceptions about rape and domestic violence.

‘In recent years we have worked hard to dispel the damaging myths and stereotypes that are associated with these cases,’ he said.

‘One such misplaced belief is that false allegations of rape and domestic violence are rife. This report presents a more accurate picture.’

Mr Starmer last week announced radical measures in the way the criminal justice system tackles child sexual abuse to prevent ‘another Savile moment in five or ten years’ time’.

He will replace the 19 practice guidelines that have been introduced over the past ten years with a single policy for England and Wales. The raft of measures is intended to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in the way child sex offenders are handled by the authorities.

Mr Starmer said prosecutors and police will now be expected to ‘explore patterns of behaviour and links to other cases’ instead of just focusing on the account of the victim.
