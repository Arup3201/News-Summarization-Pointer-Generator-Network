Spared jail: Ben Edgell, 31, kissed two teenage girls while working as a teacher at a boarding school

A public school sports teacher who kissed two teenage students after 'grooming' them with text messages and trips to the New Forest has been spared jail.

Ben Edgell, 31, was a sports coach and house tutor at the £31,000-a-year Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, when he pursued the girls, then aged 16 and 17.

The liaisons began after he swapped mobile numbers with them and encouraged them to meet in the school's cricket pavilion and on the golf course, a court heard. 

Edgell was sentenced to three months' jail, suspended for a year, after he pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person of trust between 2009 and 2013.

He was also ordered to pay £500 costs and to remain on the sex offenders' register for seven years.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard he struck up an illicit relationship with the first girl, then 16, when he was in his mid-20s.

He met her twice outside school, taking her for drives in his car to the New Forest and kissing her. 

He also met her a number of times at the school's secluded cricket pavilion at night, where again he kissed her.

Edgell moved on to his second victim two years later, the court heard.

He became 'flirtatious' with her before sending her texts, telling her he loved her and another in which he made lewd suggestions about her 'ending up naked'.

He went on to meet up with her on the school's golf course where he kissed her.

The court heard both girls consented to the behaviour, but Edgell was caught after the second girl spoke about the matter to the school's head of sport.

Edgell, who coached cricket and hockey at Canford, had been a well-regarded teacher and had a flat on school grounds in his role as a boarding house tutor, the court heard.

He was suspended from his job and resigned soon afterwards, initially denying any wrongdoing when interviewed by police.

The court heard it is now unlikely he will ever teach again.

David Bartlett, prosecuting, said Edgell contacted his first victim through Facebook.

'They swapped mobile numbers and a week later he suggested they meet up,' he said. 'He met her at a train station and drove her to the New Forest. They went for a walk, chatted and kissed.

'She said he initiated the kiss but she wasn't forced into it. She found it quite exciting because he was a teacher.

'They carried on texting and a few weeks later he took her for a drive again and they kissed again.

'He continued to text her saying he wanted to do more stuff but it never went beyond kissing.

'They did meet on occasions inside the cricket pavilion. He had keys and she thought his presence there wouldn't be surprising.

'He kept saying don't tell anyone, which annoyed her, and then she stopped communicating with him.'

Mr Bartlett said he began texting the second victim two years later.

He said: 'He sent her texts saying "I want you, I'm falling in love with you", but she was hesitant about meeting him.

'She met him by the school golf course where he held onto her jumper and kissed her with tongues. Then she didn't hear from until the next term.'

Referring to pain she was suffering, he wrote: 'I wish I could do something about it but I would get in trouble and you would end up naked.'

Audrey Archer, defending, said his client had brought shame on his family over the matter.

She said: 'He deeply regrets having kissed both these schoolgirls. He accepts full responsibility for his actions. He accepts he should have known better.

'He was going through a difficult time personally at the time of these incidents - he was struggling in gaining access and custody to his son and not having much of a life outside the school.

'His parents are deeply disappointed by the fact their son is before the court for these offences. They are a decent, good family and this has brought shame on them, which is something Mr Edgell feels greatly sorry for.'

Judge Peter Johnson told him: 'When you were in your mid to late 20s you were a well-regarded sports teacher.

'You engaged in inappropriate French kissing with them on a number of occasions after you groomed them with texts.

'Parents of school children and the public trust teachers to behave properly and not take sexual advantage of children.

'You broke that trust. You told one girl not to tell anyone and sent wholly inappropriate messages to another.

'You have lost your job, your good character and been subjected to public shame. It is unlikely you will ever be allowed to teach again.'

'Groomed'? A judge said Stuart Kerner was seduced by a pupil, then 16, and spared him jail

There were dozens of complaints last month after a judge claimed a 16-year-old girl had 'groomed' religious education teacher Stuart Kerner - despite him taking her virginity in a store cupboard.

A 'loophole' meant that because his sex offence was not within the Attorney General's unduly lenient sentence review scheme, the punishment cannot be changed.

The former vice-principal of London's Bexleyheath Academy, 44, was handed an 18-month suspended sentence - but it was the judge's comments that prompted the biggest outcry.

Mrs Justice Joanna Greenberg told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her. It was she who groomed you and you gave into temptation when you were vulnerable.' 

The judge was set to be investigated over the comments she made in court.

The religious education teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust.

Inner London Crown Court also heard he took her home for sex  while his wife was out.

Kerner, who denied any guilt and said the girl invented the affair, has launched an appeal in a bid to overturn the conviction and clear his name.
