Eastern Europeans who created a 'shanty town' beneath a church left a scene of destruction littered with discarded mattresses, electrical equipment and piles of rubbish after they were forced out by a High Court ruling.

Four van loads of rubbish and broken furniture had to be removed from the site, next to Hounslow police station, after the rough sleepers were ordered to leave.

Around 15 Eastern European migrants are believed to have made the area beneath Holy Trinity Church in Hounslow High Street their home, turning it into a type of 'shanty town.' 

They were ordered to leave after the private landowner went to the High Court to get an injunction, forcing them to move on.  

Eastern European migrants left a 'trail of devastation' after they were forced out of the shanty town they had created beneath a church 

Once they left the area officials were confronted with piles of rubbish, glass bottles and discarded clothes across the floor. 

Towels and sheets were found hanging, separating areas that appeared to have been converted into bedrooms and were littered with clothes and shoes. In other areas pieces of cardboard littered the floor along with plastic bottles and pieces of wood.

Dozens of items of furniture were also left behind, with living quarters seemingly set up around large fans and double beds. 

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told the Evening Standard: 'The commune presented health and fire risks, and locals were intimidated by the presence of the occupants, who were often intoxicated.

Police and Hounslow Council had to use four vans to remove discarded rubbish and furniture from next to Hounslow Police Station

The group of 15 migrants had set up a commune or shanty town beneath the church in Hounslow, on land which is privately owned

'Some occupants accounted for much of the anti-social behaviour and low-level crime in the Hounslow area.

'Police liaised with the council and High Court enforcement officers to carry out the eviction.'

Officers said it had taken a while for the group to be removed because the owner of the land was private and had to obtain an order through the High Court to have the migrants removed. However once this was granted they moved in quickly to remove the group. 

Steve Curran, leader of Hounslow Council said the council was pleased that had been able to improve the quality of lives of residents by dealing with the situation 'humanely.' 

He said: 'The amount of rubbish council officers cleared away takes your breath away. It's a cost to the council taxpayers which could have been spent more usefully.'

 he scene will remind some London dwellers of subway in the exclusive Park Lane area of London. A gang of homeless Romanians have set up home in the subway and have been accused of turning the area into a slum. The group was previously moved on by police but returned to the area months later.
