A Pennsylvania town near the woods where police are still searching for alleged cop killer Eric Frein has canceled Halloween because of the massive manhunt.

The Barrett Township said its annual Halloween parade - the town's biggest event of the year - and 5K Scarecrow Race will be canceled indefinitely and trick-or-treating is banned this year.

Some residents of the Pocono Mountains town said they fear that if Halloween goes ahead, Frein could escape with the help of a costume, WNEP reported.

It comes as the search for the self-described survivalist, who is believed to be hiding out in the woods near to the town, reaches its fourth week.

Where is he? Police released these digitally-enhanced pictures of Eric Frein to show what he might look like a month after he shot a trooper. He is hiding out in a wooded area, causing a nearby town to cancel Halloween

Frein has eluded authorities since he shot dead Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, as he stepped outside during a shift change on September 12. Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, was critically wounded.

Local residents expressed their disappointment that the events had been canceled, while others said they are more fearful in their hometown. 

'This parade is probably one of the biggest events that the town has every year,' Ralph Megliola, chairman of the township's Board of Supervisors, told ABC News.

'Everyone looks forward to the parade. Myself and my family personally have been away and cut our vacation short to get home in time for the parade. Thousands of people line the streets.'

The parade, which would have been the town's 50th, should have fallen on October 26.

If he is found before Halloween, the town will reconsider its Halloween activities, Megliola said. 

'It's taking a toll on everybody,' Barrett Township Police Chief Steven Williams told WNEP of the search. 'It's taking a toll on the police department. It's taking a toll on the public.'

The search is also affecting tourism to the area thanks to road blocks and hunting restrictions. Residents reported seeing scores of police cars along the roads and helicopters flying above.

Throughout their search, the survivalist has left police clues.

Most recently, Frein's journal was found ditched at a campsite near his home in Canadensis. 

In the diary, he wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on the Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that.

'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. I ran back to the Jeep.'

The diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper or that he was intending to target any  individual. Instead, in sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder.

Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been looking for Frein ever since. 

The most recent sighting came on Tuesday afternoon, when an officer thought he spotted a brief glimpse of Frein from about 200 yards away, State police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said.

That was the fourth sighting by police or the community since Friday, he said.

'We will get Frein. Whether that is today, whether that is tomorrow or whether that is next week, remains to be seen,' Bivens said.
