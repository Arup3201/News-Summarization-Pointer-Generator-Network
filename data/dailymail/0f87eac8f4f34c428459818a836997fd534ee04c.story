Tory MP Tim Yeo is fighting to save his political career after being dropped from his local party's next general election campaign

A Tory MP under fire over his outside interests is fighting for his political career after local party activists refused to re-adopt him as their General Election candidate.

Former Environment Minister Tim Yeo, who earlier this year fought off allegations of improper lobbying for a solar energy firm, has been deselected by the Tory association in his Suffolk South constituency.

Mr Yeo, 68, who has been an MP for 30 years, is said to be ‘considering his position’ after the decision by his local party’s executive committee.

The MP, who served as Environment Minister in John Major’s government, had a 8,600 majority in 2010.

But reports yesterday suggested some local Tory activists felt he had not done enough in the constituency since the last Election.

Mr Yeo has only recently been reinstated as chairman of the influential Commons’ Energy and Climate Committee after being involved in a newspaper sting last June by reporters posing as solar energy firm representatives looking to hire him at £7,000 a day.

He denied any wrong-doing, and was cleared by the cross-party Standards Committee of any breach of lobbying rules.

Mr Yeo had been forced to stand down as chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Committee amid allegations of lobbying but was reinstated after an inquiry ruled he did nothing wrong

Mr
 Yeo faced calls to give  up his energy committee role last year after 
it emerged  he reaped nearly £140,000 a year from work linked to green 
companies.

Mr Yeo was not 
available for comment last night. But his local party confirmed that it 
had ‘voted not to re-adopt Tim Yeo for the 2015 Election’.

It added: ‘Mr Yeo is now considering his position.’
