An Australian woman was forced to give birth alone in hospital in the dead of night because, she claimed, nursing staff did not respond to her cries for help.

To add to Christie Jones’s distress, she had to fumble through her handbag for pain killers while she was in labour.

‘I could have had more support at home,’ she said yesterday as an investigation began into the affair of the mother who had to deliver her own baby at Sydney’s Blacktown Hospital.

‘I was left alone just to be in pain and deliver a baby myself,’ Miss Jones told Channel 9 news. ‘I was screaming out "the baby’s coming!"

‘Next thing you know she was born on the bed.’

The terrifying incident did not end there, for the baby girl was born face down in her fluid at 2.15am and a pregnant woman in a nearby bed had to come to the new mother’s aid and work at keeping the new-born child alive.

‘I heard her (Miss Jones) moaning and it become quite loud and it didn’ t sound right to me,’ said the pregnant patient, who wanted to be known only as Danielle.

‘The baby appeared in a breach position and in a facedown position on the bed.’

She said she then got the baby ‘breathing and crying’ and then she and Miss Jones claim they had to wait for five to 10 minutes before a nurse arrived.

The ordeal for Miss Jones began on Tuesday when she arrived at Blacktown Hospital at 8.30am experiencing labour pain with her third child.

She was taken to the birthing unit but several hours later staff asked her to leave because they said she was not ready to give birth.

Miss Jones refused to go home and was then admitted to the maternity ward where a nurse reportedly told her to time her own contractions.

Miss Jones said staff failed to regularly check on her progress and for the next 18 hours she was given just four Panadol and one endone tablet, including taking Panadol tablets from her handbag, for pain relief.

The hospital’s director of nursing and midwifery, Mr David Simmonds, told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that the incident would be thoroughly investigated, but he pointed out that the birth and maternity units had highly trained midwives and a full complement of staff at the time.

‘Birth can be unpredictable and can at times come on quite quickly. Staff provided regular monitoring of the patient and offered the best possible care in the time frame,’ he said.

Labour Opposition Health spokesman Andrew McDonald has demanded answers from the NSW state government, saying it was completely unacceptable for a woman to have to give birth unattended ‘not to mention incredibly dangerous.’

Last night mother and baby were said to be healthy and ‘doing well’.
