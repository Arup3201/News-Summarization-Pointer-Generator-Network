A mother who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon bombing has been reunited in the hospital with her daughter, who was also gravely injured in the blast.

Celeste and Sydney Corcoran - both of whom were featured in separate iconic photographs from the tragedy last Monday - are now recovering in the same room at Boston Medical Center.

The family has received nearly $500,000 in donations from strangers across the world to help pay for the cost of medical care and rehabilitation.

The mother and daughter had been near the finish line at the marathon waiting to see Celeste's sister Carmen Acabbo compete in the race.

This photo of a stranger comforting Sydney spread around the world and became one of the most famous images from the aftermath of the blast

'It just hits you, like, life will never be the same, but she can still hug me,' Mrs Acabbo, 43, told NBC News. 'And I still have her. She's my very best friend and I'm just so thankful to have her in whatever capacity that I do.'

Doctors were forced the amputate both of Celeste's legs below the knee because they were so badly mangled in the bomb blast.

The 47-year-old hairdresser from Lowell, Massachusetts, appears in the top right corner of one of the most famous photos from the aftermath of the explosion. Her husband Kevin can be seen laying over her, comforting her.

'Instinct just takes over. You take your belt off, you put a tourniquet on, yell to a guy who happens to be running towards me. He gave me his belt. I put on another one,' Mr Corcoran told NBC.

'I just laid down next to her and just told her I loved her and that everything would be OK and just kissed her face and just gently caressed her face while people were trying to get to us.

'I just stayed with her laying down in this carnage. In the blood. Just holding on to her until the professionals came over and took over.'

His daughter Sydney, 18, meanwhile was many feet away. Her femoral artery had been severed by the bomb and had legs had been shredded.

Mr Corcoran couldn't find her.

'After I realized that I could not look for my daughter, I just entrusted to humanity that there had to be somebody out there who was taking care of her,' he said.

His faith was well-placed. Images emerged of Sydney being comforted by a man in a red shirt. Other pictures show another perfect stranger caring for her injury

Doctors later told Mr Corcoran that the strangers saved her life.

'This was a mortal wound and if the people did not get to her when they did she would have bled to death,' he recalls Sydney's doctor telling him.

Sydney, a high school student, was later reunited with Matt Smith - the man who saved her.

'Find Matt,' she had told her family, according to her aunt, Mrs Acabbo.

'We would all like to thank him,' Acabbo said.

Sydney Corcoran suffered shredded limbs from the shrapnel. She previously had a fractured skull after being struck by a car in 2011

Sydney, whose femoral artery was ruptured, awoke from surgery to ask relatives to locate the men who saved her life.

Her mother Celeste had to have both her legs amputated.

They got to meet actor Bradley Cooper who visited several victims.

It was another horrifying incident for 
the family as Sydney cheated death in 2011 when she survived a car 
accident which left her with a fractured skull.

'I thought we were done with traumatic events,' said Sydney's older brother, Tyler.

Sydney, a Lowell High School who is set to attend community college this fall, suffered deep arterial injuries, according to Tyler.

'Her legs were hit pretty bad,' the brother said.

The picture of the man in a red t-shirt was so touching that it sparked a false rumor on Twitter that he was proposing to his dying girlfriend.

A picture telling the tragic, but incorrect, story was retweeted 1,600 times and received 448,000 likes on Facebook. It spread around the internet before being debunked.

The attack, which left three dead and 183 injured, occurred as two bombs were detonated just seconds apart near the finish line.

'My father said everyone seemed in a 
daze. He looked down and saw my mom and her eyes were open.

'Once he 
realized she was alive, he noticed both her legs hanging on by skin. He 
asked a guy for a belt,' Tyler said.

The family was at the race to watch Accabo, Celeste's sister, compete.

A third man rushed to Sydney's aid after shrapnel tore into her legs. A relative said the family 'owes' the good Samaritans 'unspeakable gratitude'

'I thought we were done with traumatic events': Tyler, here with his mother Celeste, was supposed to attend the race with his family but cancelled at the last minute

Tyler, a college student, was supposed
 to attend the event but cancelled at the last minute because he had to 
meet with a study group.

'I
 was supposed to be there," said Tyler, fighting back tears.

'I didn't 
even think this whole thing was real until my phone started ringing like
 crazy later in the afternoon.'

Kevin, a delivery truck driver, received minor injuries but is having a difficult time coming to terms with the wounds suffered by his wife and daughter.

'My brother is just heartbroken, just devastated,' his brother, Tim Corcoran, told the Lowell Sun.

Celeste works as a hairdresser in Boston. Sydney's and Tyler's great uncle Paul Corcoran said Celeste has always been 'such an active person,' and that 'it’s going to seriously impact her career.'

'It’s just been a devastating experience,' he said. 'I don’t know how we’re going to cope with this.'

A website to raise funds for the injured mother and daughter has been created, with the goal of raising $300,000 to aid in their recovery.

By Wednesday morning, it was already more than halfway to its goal.

The website, organized by relative Alyssa Carter, included updates on their conditions.

Carter said they were headed into additional surgery Wednesday afternoon to remove further debris and make additional repairs.

'The
 nurses were able to get them in the same room and their beds are pushed
 together so they can hold hands,' Carter, Tyler and Sidney's second cousin, said.

Carter told MailOnline that both are in good spirits despite their circumstances.

'Celeste is a firecracker. She's just upset she didn't see her sister cross the finish line,' Carter said.

'Celeste is the glue of the family.'

Sydney has been more reserved since Monday but 'has cracked a few smiles. They're hanging in there. We have a large family,' Carter said.

When asked about Sydney already overcoming her 2011 accident, Carter said she feels horribly for her cousin.

'She's just a kid. It's depressing to think of Sydney's struggles.'

Carter said the fund would help cover expenses in light of Celeste not being able to immediately return to work as a hairdresser as well as do modifications on their home to accommodate their injuries.

'So much will be needed.'

Paul Corcoran said that he had been in contact with the family via Facebook and saw the picture of Sydney lying on the street all over the internet on Monday but didn't immediately realize it was her.

It wasn't until he looked at the front page of the New York Times on Tuesday that he saw it was Sydney.

'I've seen the picture online with all the articles and with the smaller ones I couldn't quite tell,' he told the Los Angeles Times in a phone interview. 'But you're looking at the front page of the New York Times. I mean, that's her.'
