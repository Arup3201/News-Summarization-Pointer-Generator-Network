You can now dine in denim at The Ritz or land your dream job wearing your favourite jeans - and no one will blink an eye.

Denim has today been revealed as the nation's favourite material and it is now so universally accepted, it's not unusual to wear jeans to fine restaurants and job interviews.

Jeans were first designed to be worn by laborers and then became synonymous with casual wear.

But driven by the likes of David Beckham 
and Cameron Diaz, denim is no longer considered a purely casual option, 
according to the research by online retailer Littlewoods.com.

Their statistics reveal that the typical British woman wears denim 152 days a year and the average man dons jeans on 181 days.

A quarter of men even wear jeans nearly every day - on 312 days a year or more.

The study revealed 31 per cent of women now wear
 jeans to work and 26 per cent (30 per cent of men) would wear 
them to a fancy restaurant.

The latter is thanks to the strict dress codes of upmarket establishments becoming more accommodating of denim.  

Although Harrods still bans customers from wearing ripped jeans in the store, in 2010 The Ritz eased their centuries-old rule to allow guests to wear jeans - albeit only at breakfast.

Indicating denim's elevation in status, one in 11 men - 9 per cent - say they even think it's now acceptable to wear jeans to a job interview.

The study of 2,000 men and women, looking at the nation's style preferences, found denim now rates above traditional luxurious fabrics such as fur, leather and wool in the fashion stakes.

The average woman's wardrobe contains eight jeans at any one time, with men having seven.

And the research found they have enduring appeal as we typically hold onto a favourite pair for eight years.

Indeed, 7 per cent of men own jeans they have had for 21 years or more. Meanwhile one in seven (14 per cent) admit they wear jeans every single day.

Denim's growing ubiquity is illustrated by the attitudes of different generations.

It would seem 35 to 44 year olds are leading the denim fashion pack in the office, with 40 per cent choosing to wear it during the daily nine-to-five.

Meanwhile those aged 25 to 34 are the most inclined to wear it on glamorous nights out, with 40 per cent of year olds wearing jeans to a stylish restaurant.

And the nation's love affair with denim is such that 46 per cent of us think it's the perfect thing to wear on a first date.

A person's favourite jeans can also serve as a gauge of changing shape.

Three quarters of women (75 per cent) admit holding on to old jeans to use as an indicator of their weight.

A near majority of 81 per cent insist that still being able to fit into their favourite pair is the ultimate confidence boost.

The study found many shoppers are willing to splash on the perfect pair of jeans.

While the average Brit spends £42 on a quality pair, one in seven 35 to 44 year olds (13 per cent) will happily pay more than £100.

Littlewoods.com's buyer Toni Craig, obtains nearly £12m worth of denim a season to feed the nation's demand for the fabric.

She said: 'We're witnessing a real denim renaissance. Jeans are no longer just something we throw on to pop to the shops, they're now acceptable to wear for almost any occasion, especially those traditionally considered to be more formal.

'Last year we sold over 680,000 pairs of jeans - black was our best selling colour, indicative of people looking for smart denim options.

'This year already we are selling 78 pairs of jeans every hour, and skinny is our best-selling style.

'True blue shades are increasing in popularity, which we believe has been fuelled by the need for an outfit to transcend day and night time.'

Too much: Denim may now be acceptable in formal situations but - but don't over do it like Britney and Justin back in 2001. Luckily Justin has learnt from this fashion faux par and is one of the best dressed celebrities in denim today
