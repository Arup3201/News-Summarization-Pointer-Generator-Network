Controversial: A cartoon aired on Channel 4 has sparked anger after mocking Princess Diana and Jade Goody

Complaints: The ghosts of both women made appearances in Full English - with one scene showing the pair attempt to strangle each other in a row over who was the real 'People's Princess'

The cartoon, shown at 10.50pm on Monday night, shows two characters holding a seance for a 'great woman'. Suddenly Jade, who died of cervical cancer in 2009, appears as a foul-mouthed ghost.

Later in the show, the ghost of Princess Diana arrives. But her opening remarks will no doubt be found offensive by many people.

In reference to the Paris crash in 1997 which killed Princess Diana, the cartoon character says: 'Sorry I'm late everyone. Had some car trouble, the traffic was absolute murder.'

Diana is then labelled a 'bulimic slut'  by Jade, in reference to her eating disorder.

The ghost of Diana then calls Jade 'baldy' before the pair begin to fight by grabbing each other around the throat.

The racism row involving Jade and Shilpa Shetty from Celebrity Big Brother in 2007 is also brought up in the cartoon.

Fury: The cartoon shows two characters holding a seance for a 'great woman'

Tasteless: Following the seance, the ghost of the late Jade Goody appears

At one point, Jade's character says: 'I call someone a poppadom and everybody hated me, then I got cancer and everyone loved me again.'

The cartoon clearly infuriated some viewers, with some taking to Twitter to vent their anger.

Adam B tweeted: 'I do not really like 
this Full English show. It is not Family Guy and it just did a cancer gag on Jade Goody. It wasn't in good taste.'

Sam Jones said: 'Quite disgusted the way Channel 4's Full English took the p**s out of the late Jade Goody.'

Full English is a new animated sitcom based around the Johnson family.

The controversial episode was only the second to be shown.

Complaints: Shortly afterwards, Princess Diana's ghost appears before she and Jade fight

Channel 4 describes it as 'unashamedly rude and silly, with identifiable characters and hilarious stories.'

A C4 spokesperson said: 'Full English is a late night animated sitcom that takes a satirical swipe at popular culture, celebrities and every other aspect of modern British life.

'Appropriate warnings flagged that the show contained humour of an adult nature and the content was within viewers expectations of those tuning in to a comedy at this time.'

A spokesman for Ofcom confirmed it had received a number of complaints about the show.

He said: 'I can confirm we have received a number of complaints. We are assessing them at the moment.'
