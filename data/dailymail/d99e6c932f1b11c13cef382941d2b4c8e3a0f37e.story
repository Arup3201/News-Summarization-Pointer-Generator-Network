Tottenham are showing an interest in Mexico centre-back Hector Moreno.

The 26-year-old plays for Espanyol, the former club of Mauricio Pochettino, and the Tottenham coach knows the stylish centre-back well having brought him to Spain from Mexico.

Everton, Southampton and Swansea have also shown an interest in recent months with the Spanish side looking for £7million.

Most wanted: Mexico's Hector Moreno has attracted interest from Tottenham, Everton and Swansea

Moreno was one of Mexico's heroes in Tuesday night's draw with Brazil and Tottenham want to strengthen in defence with Michael Dawson, Younes Kaboul and Vlad Chiriches all expected to move on.

Tottenham have been linked with Real Madrid left-back Marcelo but that may prove too rich a deal. They are also monitoring Argentina and Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo.

Cardiff have also expressed an interest in Moreno, but have only offered around £4million for him.
