Militants have killed five people in a gun attack on a restaurant in Mali's capital, including a French citizen and a Belgian security officer with the EU delegation in the country, authorities say.

Mali's desert north, where French forces wrested control of territory from separatist rebels and al Qaeda-linked fighters, is plagued by frequent political violence - but this is the first militant attack for years in Bamako, in the south.

Three Malians were also killed in the violence, which began about 1am, in and around La Terrasse restaurant, which is popular with expatriates.

It also left nine people injured and authorities said two people have been arrested.

Senior police officer Falaye Kanta said: 'There were two individuals who were armed and hooded.

'One burst into the La Terrasse restaurant and opened fire on people. Then he got into a vehicle in which the other was waiting.

'As they fled down a neighbouring street, they shot a Belgian man who was in front of his house.

'He's dead. Not far away they came across a police vehicle and threw a grenade, killing the driver.'

Those killed included a girl who died in hospital, Kanta said. Witnesses said police secured the street where the restaurant shooting took place because of unexploded grenades.

Two international experts with the United Nations Mine Action Service were among the wounded, according to initial reports, said Mongi Hamdi, U.N. special envoy for the peacekeeping mission to Mali (MINUSMA).

French forces took control of northern Mali two years ago but insurgents continue to mount attacks. France has more than 3,000 soldiers in West Africa as part of a counter-insurgency force against al Qaeda-linked militants.

Mali's government signed a preliminary peace proposal on Sunday meant to end fighting with northern separatists, but the Tuareg-led rebels demanded more time before agreeing to any accord.

France and Belgium condemned the attack at La Terrasse restaurant and bar in Bamako and their foreign ministers confirmed the deaths of their nationals.

European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said one of the victims of the Bamako attack was a Belgian security officer with the EU delegation in the capital.

'This terrorist act strengthens even more our resolve to help fight terrorism throughout the region,' she said.

Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders denounced a 'cowardly act of terror' and France's Laurent Fabius said 'everything must be done to find those responsible for this crime.'

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed a French citizen was among those killed and said the attack strengthened France's resolve to 'fight terrorism in all its forms'.

The French embassy in Mali said on Saturday it had alerted its citizens and beefed up security.
