A Detroit man pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing his father’s corpse from a local cemetery because he wanted to resurrect the 93-year-old man.

Vincent Bright, 48, told prosecutors he hoped to bring his father back to life through prayer after stealing the cadaver Jan 14. and stuffing it in a freezer.

Believing Bright was disturbed, prosecutors initially asked for a mental health evaluation, it turns out the body snatcher was just overcome with grief.

His bail was set at $75,000 so a mental health evaluation could be completed, it found him fit for trial.If convicted of disinterring a body, Vincent Bright would have faced up to 10 years in prison, he instead will receive probation for pleading guilty.

Vincent Bright will be formally sentenced for the bizarre crime on Sept. 24. He has a criminal history that dates back to the 1980s, according to ClickOnDetroit, but his lawyer told the station those crimes were 'minor felonies.'

A second person was arrested in connection with the crime, but it is not clear if he faces any charges.
