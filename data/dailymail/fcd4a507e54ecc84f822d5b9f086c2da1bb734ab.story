The former colleagues of the ex-solider charged with killing American Sniper author Chris Kyle and another man say the veteran on trial in Texas is not the Marine they had come to know in Iraq. 

They say Eddie Ray Routh respected and cherished people who had jobs like former Navy SEAL Kyle.

Routh, 27, is charged with capital murder after allegedly killing Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a gun range in Stephenville, Texas, in February 2013.

Men who served with 'Routhy' in Combat Logistics Battalion 8 at Camp Fallujah in 2007 and 2008 believe something must have happened to turn him from a gung-ho Marine into an alleged double murderer.

Former Cpl. Ryker Pawloski said: 'The Routh I knew looked up to people who did that kind of job.

'He respected war fighters like you wouldn't believe.

'None of us who deployed with him know what's wrong.

''We want to know what's wrong, and we want him to get help. 

'Because all of us kind of have the collective feeling of, you know, we let our brother down.'

A solider who shared a metal trailer with Routh at Camp Fallujah, Corey Smalley, said: 'It just doesn't fathom.

'He wasn't the picture-perfect Marine, even though that's what he wanted to be. 

'And the people he looked up to the most were people like Chris Kyle. 

'He always wanted to be those people - be the people that Marines from now on will always be talking about.'

 Prosecutors will seek life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty if Routh (above) is convicted

Routh (seen in 2008) was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job after he came back to the United States from his military service

Shortly after the unit reached Fallujah, Routh was ordered help guard Iraqi prisoners at Balad Air Base, 

Although Routh had no love for the captured fighters, Smalley said he was disturbed at how they were treated.

He told Smalley some guards would use the leashed prisoners' heads to push open the metal cell doors and 'he just didn't feel like that was called for'.

Smalley did see a glimmer of the man he knew when Routh confessed and asked if he could apologize to the families of Kyle and Littlefield. 

He said: 'I'd love to have an hour to just sit down with him and talk to him.

'I would put money on it, that he wasn't in his right mind. 

'That there was something going on that, he made an unconscious decision to make that mistake.'

Routh reportedly wanted to meet with Kyle's parents, Wayne and Deby (above), so he could apologize to them

Routh was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job after he came back from his military service.

His defense has argued that when Routh killed Kyle and Littlefield 'he was in the grip of a psychosis' so severe he didn't know it was wrong.'

The prosecution has argued otherwise and said that Routh killed the two men because he was upset Kyle had brought Littlefield to the range, NBC News reported. 

A psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution, Dr Michael Arambula, said: '[Routh] didn't have issues with Chris [Kyle], only Chad [Littlefield], but because Chris would shoot him for shooting Chad, he had to shoot Chris. 

'And that makes sense and is not psychotic thinking." 

Prosecutors will seek life in prison without parole if Routh is convicted instead of the death penalty
