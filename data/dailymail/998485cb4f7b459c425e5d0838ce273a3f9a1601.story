Police arrested three people in central London after thousands of revellers dressed as Father Christmas ran amok.

The world-wide internet flash-mob gathering SantaCon, in which strangers agree to meet dressed as Father Christmas before hitting the streets for some festive fun, has been criticised in the past for some revellers getting a little carried away and heavy drinking.

This year in London, crowds walked from Marble Arch to Portland Place while singing carols and giving out sweets on Saturday.

But while gathered outside the BBC’s Broadcasting House, several started to climb nearby scaffolding and lampposts.

Others ran into the streets and sat on moving cars while dozens of police officers patrolled the gathering.

Starting in Trafalgar Square, SantaCon participants usually bring plenty of alcohol to keep up the festive cheer, before heading off to bars elsewhere around the capital.

A
 Scotland Yard spokesman said around 100 officers patrolled the event 
leading to three arrests for theft, robbery and public disorder 
offences.

Meanwhile, some revellers in New York also got a little carried away -  with six Santas and one  elf - brawling on the streets.

In footage captured by a resident of a nearby apartment, the Santas slide across the snowy, 
slushy streets, throwing punches at one another.

At one point, one of 
the men dressed as an elf, had his head smashed into the trunk of a 
taxi.

This year's event got under way in 
Tompkins Square Park, which filled with thousands of party-goers dressed
 as Santas, sexy Mrs Clauses in fishnet stocking, peculiar elves, 
gingerbread houses, pink bunnies and, inexplicably, pandas.

The
 Christmas armada then slowly made its way to Brooklyn, where a Rudolph 
dance-off was staged at Camden Park Plaza East, followed by an impromptu
 snowball fight and a massive party in a warehouse on Atlantic Avenue.

The New York Police Department (NYPD) stationed 80 'helper elves' along the course of the event.

A spokesman said there were no arrests associated with this year's SantaCon.

Elsewhere the festive party also invaded the streets of San Francisco - where the event originally started in the early ninties.

Scores of Santas gathered by the Christmas tree in Union Square to kick off the event.

Some more creative revellers dressed outside the brief - coming as snowmen, Christmas trees and other festive favourites.

Far from the chilly weather this side of the pond, the San Francisco event was sunny and warm, 
leaving many participants feeling rather hot in their Santa costumes.

Meanwhile, hundreds of party goers took to the street of Vancouver, Canada, on Saturday.

In
 the city of Vancouver, the party began at 11 in the morning local time 
in the Downtown Eastside at the No. 5 Orange strip club.

Revellers then moved south along Main Street through Chinatown to the Ivanhoe Pub.

SantaCon was originally called Santarchy and first took place in San Francisco in 1994.

It now spans events in more than 300 cities and 44 countries worldwide.

The worldwide event is described on 
the official website as a ‘non-profit, non-political, non-religious 
celebratory parade of Christmas cheer, goodwill, and fun’.

Santas taking part are encouraged to sing, hand out presents even have strangers sit on their lap.

Although some people got a little too 
merry, SantaCon's website made it clear the event is a meant to be a 
‘festive culture jam,’ not a bad-Santa bender.

A new record has been set for the largest gathering of elves in Bridgend, South Wales.

The town has beaten its own record for the number of elves gathered in one place - with over 1,300 of Santa's helpers coming together on Saturday.

The town centre was awash with people dressed in pointy hats and green and red tunics in the hope of becoming record breakers.

Record breakers: Over 900 people turned out for an elf-themed record attempt in Bridgend, south Wales

Thousands of helpers: Over 1,200 people flocked into the small town to take part in the attempt

To qualify as an elf, people had to turn up wearing their own red or green costumes and special elf hats were provided.

They succeeded in breaking the previous record of 1,200 elves set this time last year with a total of 1,312 participants.

'It’s very green and red,' said event organiser Mike Evans, tourism team leader at Bridgend council.

'They make a lot of noise as well. But it’s a fantastic thing to see.'

Bridgend took the record from New York two years ago and has remained champion ever since.
