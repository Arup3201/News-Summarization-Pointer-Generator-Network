American-style liberty is finally coming to London - if only own paper. Original copies of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence are are display in Britain for the first time.

The two documents, instrumental to the founding of the United States, will be on display at the British Library - along with the Magna Carta, England's own foundational charter.

The copy of the Declaration of Independence, which has been loaned by the New York Public Library, was written out by Found Father Thomas Jefferson, who later became the third President of the fledgling nation.

The Declaration of Independence will be on loan from the New York Public Library. It will help commemorate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta

It includes a lengthy condemnation of slavery that was later removed from the document. Jefferson, like many of the Founding Fathers, was a slave owner.

The Bill of Rights, borrowed from the US National Archives, is one of 14 original copies produced in 1789, of which 12 are known to survive.

Curator Claire Breay said: 'Magna Carta is one of the most famous historical documents in the world. Almost 800 years after it was first issued, it remains a potent symbol of liberty and rights around the world.

'We're absolutely delighted that both the US National Archives and New York Public Library have generously agreed to lend these exceptionally important documents to the British Library.

Our exhibition next year will provide a unique opportunity to see them displayed with our two original 1215 Magna Carta documents, from which they drew some of their core principles.'

The British Library will host the documents next year, along with Britain's constitution, the 800-year-old Magna Carta

The exhibition, called Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy, runs from March 13 to September 1 next year.

Tony Marx, President of the New York Public Library, said : 'The bedrock of our modern-day society is rooted in the historic documents of the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, and Bill of Rights - the result of brave citizens who understood the importance of change and reform.

'The Library is proud to join together with the British Library and the U.S. National Archives in this extraordinary exhibition, which provides us with the rare opportunity to share the handwritten words of Thomas Jefferson, a great statesman and founding father of the United States.'
