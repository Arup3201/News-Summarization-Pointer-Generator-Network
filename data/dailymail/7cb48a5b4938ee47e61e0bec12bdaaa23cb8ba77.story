Landing on Mars is no easy business.

In the past small vehicles could land using airbags and regular parachutes.

But bigger vehicles require much more innovative ways of making it to the surface, leading Nasa to design a new breed of parachute.

The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator is a giant parachute being developed by Nasa that could one day be used to land humans on the red planet

The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) is one of the largest parachutes ever built.

The reason for its size is to deal with the atmosphere on Mars.

Earth has a reasonably thick atmosphere, so we can parachute relatively easily to the surface.

But the Martian atmosphere is much thinner, so parachutes need to be much larger in order to create sufficient drag to land safely.

The system is designed to land large vehicles on the surface of Mars.

The Curiosity rover, for example, needed an innovative landing method due to its size but this technology wasn’t ready yet.

Instead, to land the rover on the surface Nasa developed a landing mechanism that used rockets known as the ‘sky crane’.

The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) is the successor to the Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD-R), pictured, another Nasa-designed parachute

Nasa has already been testing the strength of the LDSD using rocket sleds. The tests in June will be the first to drop it from the upper reaches of the atmosphere

The LDSD, however, is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than Curiosity, such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves.

The LDSD is unique in its design, using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag.

When
 attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at Mach 3.5 it will 
be capable of slowing it down to Mach 2, where a regular parachute can 
then deploy.

To simulate the Martian atmosphere on Earth, the LDSD will be lifted to a height of 37 kilometres (23 miles) by a high-altitude balloon.

A small rocket will then launch it 18 kilometres (11 miles) higher.

As this point the LDSD will inflate around a larger saucer-shaped object, bringing it safely back to land in open water.

‘It may seem obvious, but the difference between landing and crashing is stopping,’ Allen Chen, a Mars landing expert at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California told New Scientist.

‘We really only have two options for stopping at Mars: rockets and aerodynamic drag.’

There will be four tests of the LDSD in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future Mars missions.

The tests are taking place over the Hawaiian island of Kauai in June.

‘Personally I think it’s a game-changer,’ Robert Braun at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta said.

‘You could take a mass to the surface equal to something like 1 to 10 Curiosities.

‘Think about it like a bridge for humans to Mars.

‘This is the next step in a sequence of technologies that would need to be developed.’
