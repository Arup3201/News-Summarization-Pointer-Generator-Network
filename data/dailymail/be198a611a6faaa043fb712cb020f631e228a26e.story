However, despite the huge sums, America's wealthiest did not give as much as they did before the recession. 

In 2007, the biggest gifts from individuals came to $4.1billion.

The amounts on the 2013 list came to $100-million.

Twelve of the 15 donations on the 2013 list went to universities and colleges. 

Second on the list was Philip Knight, co-founder of Nike and his wife Penelope, who pledged $500 million to Oregon Health and Science University Foundation for cancer research.

They have said they will ensure all money is donated to the foundation if the it matches the donation within the next two years.

Michael Bloomberg came next after making a $350million pledge to John Hopkins University to give financial aid to undergraduate students.
