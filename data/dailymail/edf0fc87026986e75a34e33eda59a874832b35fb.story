Stuart Broad has taken to Twitter to post a snap of the nasty facial injury he suffered during the fourth Test against India. 

And England's fast bowler looked in high spirits despite the nature of the damage that forced him to retire from the match. 

He was struck in the face from a short-pitched delivery from Varun Aaron that managed to smash through his helmet's protective grille.

Ouch! Stuart Broad takes to Twitter to show off his painful-looking facial injury

Painful: Broad takes a big hit to the face after a Varun Aaron ball went straight through the grille of his helmet

Distress: Broad looks in a bad way after the incident on Saturday afternoon

Bandaged up: Broad looks in a much better way after getting treatment for the injury

Broad was immediately taken to a nearby hospital in Manchester, where he was able to receive treatment.

And despite being unable to collect his man-of-the-match award for his superb display at Old Trafford, but he is expected to be fit to play in the final Test starting on Friday.

Thanks in part to Broad's heroics, England won the match comfortably, and will take a 2-1 series lead to the Oval. 

Lucky escape: It could have been a lot worse for Broad despite suffering a nasty injury
