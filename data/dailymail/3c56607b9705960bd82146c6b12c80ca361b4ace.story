Ask me if I’m a bag or a shoes girl and I’ll say shoes every time. They are the first thing I notice about another woman’s outfit and the one thing in my own wardrobe I’ll splash money on.

Furthermore, after years working on glossy women’s magazines, I like to think I can spot designer shoes at 30 paces. From the cut of the leather to the detailing and shade of the dye, I’ve always believed it was easy when it came to sorting budget from luxury labels.

Or so I thought. In the past few months I’ve been taken in by more bargain basement styles than I care to mention.

So, am I wasting my money on designer footwear? Should I be heading for the budget shoe departments this spring? And can cheap shoes ever be as comfortable as expensive ones?

I decided to find out. My challenge was to road-test five key styles for this season  - in each case trying on one pair costing less than £30 and another with a three-figure price tag.

Could you tell the difference?

French Sole (right) failed to live up to its £10 competitors from BHS (left)

SNAKE BALLERINA PUMPS

BHS: £10  French Sole: £120

STYLE: French Sole is the Rolls-Royce of flats, loved by Kates Moss and Middleton. I buy a pair every spring and wear them so often I feel I can justify the cost. So, it’s remarkable BHS’s snake-effect fabric (left) looks very like the French Sole leather (right) and is almost as butter soft. Who’d have thought cheap shoes could be so chic?

CUT & FIT: The front of the BHS shoe comes much higher up the foot, which could cause blisters. But they are wide across your feet, meaning you will keep the circulation in your little toes. As with a real ballet shoe, the drawstring on the French Sole style can be tightened to give a perfect fit.

Winner: BHS

Almost identical to its Asos (left) rival the Russel and Bromley (right) kitten heels are over six times the price

KITTEN HEELS

Asos.com: £27 Russell &  Bromley: £175

STYLE: The Asos heels (above left) are a more flattering nude shade than the more expensive pair (right). They’ll bring a bit of warmth to a pale skin tone. The strap sits across the front of the foot rather than around the ankle, which is better for someone with curvy calves as it lengthens the leg. I’m disappointed in the oddly cheap looking Russell & Bromley pair.

CUT & FIT: The Asos leather might not be real, but it’s baby soft and these shoes feel like slippers. I’m guessing they wouldn’t stand up to rough treatment but they’re a joy to walk in and a perfect size 5.

Though the shoes are pointy, the front is cut low so there’s no uncomfortable rubbing across the big toe joint.

The fit of the Russell & Bromley pair is good, but I’m not sure what justifies the hefty price tag.

Winner: Asos

Although the overall look of Lucy Choi pair (right) was more sophisticated Anna says the fit was awful

GLITTER COURTS

Graceland: £14.99 Lucy Choi London: £195

STYLE: The Graceland glitter (left) is much more obvious than on the Lucy Choi pair (right), which have a sophisticated sheen rather than in-your-face sparkle. The cheap ones look as if they belong in a strip club and the platform sole at the front isn’t helping.

CUT & FIT: The Graceland shoes look like something you’d see on a panto dame, but they are remarkably comfortable. But I’d challenge anyone who knew their shoes not to pick these out as the cheap ones. However, the Lucy Choi heels are absolutely tiny.

My feet are on the small side of size five, but this pair is virtually impossible to get on. When I do manage to shoehorn my feet in, my little toes scream in agony. I can barely walk. Yes, they may be beautiful, but sadly they are totally unwearable.

Winner: Graceland, available at Deichman.com

Anna says the Dorothy Perkins pair (right) cut in uncomfortably and gape around the side of the foot

WEDGED HEELS

Dorothy Perkins: £25 Nine West: £100

Style: The Dorothy Perkins suedette (left) feels and looks saggy. As for the height - oh dear, what is going on here? It’s almost as though the designers were going for a flatform (a one-height raised sole), but they chickened out at the last minute and went for a wedge instead. The Nine West wedges (right) in attractive red patent have a cork look sole.

Cut & fit: The Dotty P peep-toe cuts in uncomfortably just at the base of the nail of my big toe and the suedette bags and gapes around the side of my foot. Sorry - I can’t see a reason to buy these shoes when there are plenty of good wedges out there.

The Nine West slingback sits comfortably at the top of the heel and doesn’t dig into the tendon (which can be a problem with cheaper, badly cut styles). The peep-toe is well-cut, too. Though these shoes will give you lots of height, they also feel secure. I could run for a bus in this pair.

Winner: Nine West

Anna said that the New Look pair looked promising but scuffed almost immediately after putting them on

HEELED STRAPPY SANDALS

New Look: £14.99 LK Bennett: £195

Style: The New Look suedette fabric (above left) is a nice inky black in the box, but they scuff almost as soon as I put them on. And I find myself continually adjusting the double-straps to get them an equal distance apart.The wider heels and more sensible single ankle strap of the LK Bennetts (above right) make them more of a day/work sandal than glamorous evening shoes. A real wardrobe essential.

Cut & fit: The New Look sandals are unforgiving across the front, leading to dead little toes. This is a bit of a let-down as lots of the cheaper shoes I’ve admired on friends have turned out to be from New Look, so I’m disappointed these ones weren’t better.

The LK Bennett leather is strong enough to make your feet feel as if they’re going to stay put (important when you’re wearing a heel this high), but is equally soft enough to be comfortable.There’s nothing wrong with these shoes, but they’re rather run of the mill to justify the nearly £200 price tag.

Winner:  LK Bennett
