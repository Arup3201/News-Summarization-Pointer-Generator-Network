They're not the most likely bedfellows.

But a couple of professional BMX riders revealed their inner elegance as they danced and pirouetted on stage  with a ballerina.

Two-wheeled wonders Keelan Philips and Louis Morris joined  Amber Doyle for a run through the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy - one of ballet's most celebrated dances.

The amazing show was captured on camera - and set to a remixed version of Tchaikovsky's classic tune against a wintery theatrical backdrop.

The video begins with the ballerina and bikers limbering up for two very different performances. 

The trio then dance across the stage, interacting with each other and mirroring each other's movements.

At times the cyclists came perilously close to the ballerina - although thankfully she emerged unscathed

The film shows off a series of stunningly co-ordinated visual parallels between the dancer and riders, with classical ballet movements like chaines, jetes and pirouettes perfectly mirroring the BMX stunts such as cliffhangers, 360s and time machines.

Ballerina Amber Doyle trained at the Royal Ballet School and has performed at the Royal Opera House, Brit Awards and Royal Variety Performance, as well as appearing in Anna Karenina.

Ballerina Amber Doyle said: 'Bikes and ballerinas aren't usually considered natural partners, but you can't deny the final performance looks stunning'

BMX rider Keelan Philips is four-time UK and two-time European BMX champion, and Louis Morris is fast becoming one of the UK's most in-demand riders thanks to his fearless attitude.

Keelan said: 'This is one of the most interesting challenges I've had in a while.

'It was great fun working with Amber to choreograph all the moves we could do, putting together our BMX street-style and her classical dancing.

'We hope everyone enjoys the video.'

The Ballet BMX was the brainchild of delivery company Whistl who wanted to share some seasonal cheer

The ballet BMX was the brainchild of delivery company Whistl, who decided to put on a unique staging of the famous ballet to share some seasonal cheer with their customers and the British public.

Nick Wells, CEO of Whistl, said: 'We're known as innovators in the UK postal sector and wanted to do something that truly reflected our commitment to doing things differently.

'We hope that the public, our customers and our posties love the original spin we've put on The Nutcracker this winter!'
