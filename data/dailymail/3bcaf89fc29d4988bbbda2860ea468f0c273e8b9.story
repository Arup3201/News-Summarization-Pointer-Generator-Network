She is the highest paid model in the world and the long-legged beauty that Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell credit as the only true remaining 'supermodel', but life wasn't always so easy for Gisele Bundchen.

According to acclaimed photographer Mario Testino, nobody in the fash pack even batted an eyelid at the girl now tipped to become the world's first ever billionaire supermodel.

'Nobody liked her, nobody wanted 
her,' said Testino.

Acclaimed photographer Mario Testino credits himself for bringing Gisele to fame when nobody else in the fashion world cared

'I had to fight to get her into my stories because 
nobody thought she was right - too this, too that, the nose, the 
breasts, the waist. But I believe in being obsessed, in getting 
obsessed,' he told The Observer.

Testino, 57, made no mistake in tipping 32-year-old Gisele for stardom.

The model, actress and world famous 
Victoria's Secret model's total earnings over the last 10 years have 
passed the $250 million mark, according to Forbes.

And as for prolific photographer Testino, who shot the iconic Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge engagement photographs as well as snaps of Princess
Diana and Kate Moss, his Peruvian upbringing wasn't anywhere near as 
glamorous as his current day job.

Growing up in Lima, Peru, his fashion-forward style was vilified by his fellow residents.

'They screamed at me in the street: "Faggot,"

'All my allowance went on taxi fares. I couldn't take public transport the way I dressed,' he said in the candid interview.

But since arriving in London in 1977, his career has gone from strength to strength.

He
is the man credited for reviving Gucci, is loved and trusted by the 
Royal family and has even been described as the world's most prolific 
magazine photographer.

Although Testino was vilified in his native Peru, he now is a loyal member of the fash pack and is regularly spotted on the front row with his close friend Kate Moss
