A poker player was sentenced to two years in prison yesterday after using infra-red contact lenses and cards marked with invisible ink to win games.

The high-tech scam saw Stefano Ampollini, a 56-year-old Italian nicknamed ‘Parmesan’, rake in up to £60,000 pounds in one night at an upmarket casino in Cannes, on the French Riviera.

Describing himself as a ‘player and cheat with an international reputation’, Ampollini told a criminal court in nearby Grasse that he was proud of his ‘work’.

He used insiders at ‘Les Princes’ casino to mark cards with the invisible ink, and could then ‘read’ them using the contact lenses, which he bought in China for around £1,800.

Ampollini always sat opposite another accomplice, another Italian codenamed ‘The Israeli’, who sniffed or snorted to signal what cards Ampollini should choose.

The complicated scam enabled Ampollini to ‘control the game’ without being caught, he said.

Marc Concas, barrister for the owners of the casino, said: ‘Security found his behaviour rather strange as he won very easily and, above all, because he folded twice when he had an excellent hand, suggesting he knew the croupier’s cards.’

It was at this point that police were called, and detectives launched an immediate investigation along with casino staff.

Telephone intercepts proved staff had handed cards over to the Italians, who had marked them with invisible ink.

They were then placed under cellophane and returned to a casino cupboard, ready to be used during games.

When Ampollini  returned to the casino two months after the first scam, he won some £19,000 pounds, but was then arrested by police.

In court in Grasse, the well-dressed Ampollini smiled as presiding judge Marc Joando, who marvelled at his sophisticated techniques.

Ampollini was sentenced to two years in prison and was ordered to pay a fine  equivalent to £88,000.

Two other defendants involved in the scam were also sentenced:  Gianfranco Tirrito, 55, got three years, and Rocco Grassanno, 57, got two-and-a-half years in prison.
