What is it with Liverpool and England? It’s only four months ago that their players seemed to dominate the national team and the club had apparently provided a blueprint for potential World Cup success.

Their rampant attacking - though ultimately fruitless - charge towards the title at the end of last season was powered by the core of England’s World Cup team; Glen Johnson, Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and, most thrillingly, most promisingly, Raheem Sterling.

But what seemed to be a relationship with multiple mutual benefits didn’t last long. First Gerrard retired, despite Hodgson wishing him to stay on. Then there was Brendan Rodgers complaining bitterly that England had ignored their post-match recovery plan for Sturridge last month after the Norway friendly, resulting in the striker’s injury. Now Sterling says he is too tired to play for his country.

Rodgers looks like a re-incarnation of Sir Alex Ferguson, with club always trumping country while Hodgson appears to have buckled under the pressure applied by the Liverpool manager.

Hodgson of course would deny this. He argued passionately on Sunday night that dropping Sterling against Estonia was merely the most sensible option at the end of what has been a phenomenal six months for the 19-year-old. 'In this particular moment, it’s a no brainer situation,' said the England boss.

Yet, when he adds, ‘I’m pretty sure when he goes back to Liverpool they’ll sort him out and come Sunday (against QPR) you’ll see him flying around,’ it’s difficult not to raise a Carlo Ancelotti-sized quizzical eyebrow. What was it about the 45 minutes against San Marino that so fatigued him?

The mental strain of the game is the most widely held explanation, a suggestion at which Hodgson hinted. 'It isn’t quite as simple as the training you’re doing maybe taking some juice from your legs,' he said. 'There is an awful lot going on in your head as well.'

Yet he would surely have been wiser simply to say that he had taken the decision on Sterling’s behalf, rather than revealing that the player had pronounced himself tired.

If Hodgson had taken full responsibility for the situation, which he could have easily done after the match had been won and there was no risk of being ridiculed for a left-field selection, the story would all have been much less of an issue. 

Now it’s all about how much young players want to play for England and Sterling’s frame of mind, a much more loaded and unpredictable news agenda.

Sterling has featured in 10 games for Liverpool this season and has played more than 1,000 minutes

Add in the fact that Hodgson himself was a short-lived and unpopular manager at Liverpool – scepticism for the current England side seems most pronounced on Merseyside – then the potential for misunderstanding and conflict seems ripe.

Rodgers’ reaction this week will be fascinating. Will he be grateful Sterling had been given a break? Or annoyed that his young star has been thrust into the limelight? Certainly we know which questions are going to dominate his press briefings this week and they won’t be his potential tactics to take on QPR.

Interestingly, we’ve been here before with England and Liverpool, in 1977. Then, one of Europe’s greatest ever teams stood on verge of dominating the European Cup and, although there was significant Irish, Scottish and Welsh contingent, within the side were a number of Englishmen.

Ron Greenwood, who had just started as England manager, must have relished the prospect of fusing club and country. It never quite worked out like that.

Brendan Rodgers looks like a re-incarnation of Sir Alex Ferguson by putting club before country 

In his first fixture, Greenwood picked six Liverpool players in Ray Clemence, Phil Neal, Terry McDermott, Emlyn Hughes, Ray Kennedy and Ian Callaghan. A seventh, Kevin Keegan, his captain, had only just left the club to join SV Hamburg. 

The match was a friendly against Switzerland at Wembley and England drew 0-0, hardly the most inspiring start.

And while Liverpool went on to add to their 1977 European Cup triumph in 1978, 1981 and 1984, through that period England struggled, Greenwood coming under pressure as his team only scraped into the newly-expanded 1982 World Cup finals and then failing to reach the 1984 European Championship under Bobby Robson.

Clearly club and country can work in tandem, as Barcelona/Spain and Bayern Munich/Germany have proved in recent international tournaments. 

And even if four months on from the World Cup, it now looks like Arsenal will be providing the foundations of the England team, the national side still owes a huge debt to Rodgers’ Liverpool.

I believe the manner in which his side took on the Premier League last season helped sway Hodgson towards a more attacking, youthful approach.

On Sunday night Jack Wlshere was talking about the ‘five-second fury’ in which the England players try to press to win the ball back within the first five seconds of losing. It was especially evident  in Tallinn and it’s a tactic straight out of Melwood. 

The diamond with Sterling at its tip, the full backs pushing on: all have been made fashionable by Rodgers and have the potential to turn England into a force once more.

In Steve Peters, the two managers even share a psychiatric adviser. Perhaps he can get their inner chimps to calm down and agree on a common strategy for Sterling. 

For England have so much to gain from Liverpool and Sterling thriving and maybe this time, unlike in the late 70s and early 80s, their energy can be harnessed to forge a successful national team.
