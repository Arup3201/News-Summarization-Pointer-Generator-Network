Michelle Obama has proudly joined the AARP as her 50th birthday marks her automatic acceptance into the seniors advocacy group.

The First Lady posted a photo of herself holding a membership card to her Twitter account this morning, saying that she is 'excited to join Barack in the 50+ club today'.

She can count herself among the senior advocacy group's 37 million members and the $16 she paid to enroll in the group buys her a year-long subscription to their magazine as well as discounts on cruises, Denny's meals and Kindle readers.

'Not only is Mrs. Obama helping to change and reshape the way people look at aging in this country, but sheâ€™s also showing folks how great 50 looks today,' AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement.

'I have never felt more confident': Michelle Obama's big 50th White House bash is Friday and while she says she's never felt better, she's unwilling to rule out any future nips or tucks

'Weâ€™re proud to be able to call her a 
member of the AARP family and know that she will continue to set a great
 example to all by showing that age sets no boundaries on what you can 
achieve in life.'

In 
addition to celebrating with an extended vacation in Hawaii topped off 
with a party in her honor at Oprah Winfrey's house, Mrs Obama will be 
feted this weekend at the White House where Beyonce is rumored to be 
included in the lineup.

'I have never felt more confident in myself, more clear on who I am as a woman,' she said of turning the big five-oh.

Though her confidence is high, the first 
lady and perennial fitness advocate says she just can't rule out any 
future nips and tucks.

'Women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves,' the first lady told People magazine in an interview hitting newsstands Friday, her birthday.

While she's not intending to celebrate with her first Botox injection or eyelift, she says one or the other could very well happen one day.

'Right now, I don't imagine that I would go that route, but I've also learned to never say never.'

Her message to women is to be healthy. Mrs. Obama says she has never missed a health checkup, including mammograms and Pap smears. She's also had a colonoscopy.

By her own account, she feels more relaxed now that President Barack Obama's days as a candidate are over.

'That layer is gone now. It gives me a little more room to breathe,' she told an interviewer.

Sweet moment: The President greeted Mrs Obama during an event about the importance of college

Nearly five years after assuming the first lady's role following a bruising campaign in which she sometimes became a target, Mrs. Obama is showing increased comfort in what amounts to a volunteer position with a host of responsibilities and outsized expectations. Not to mention a sometimes-unforgiving spotlight.

'I have never felt more confident in 
myself, more clear on who I am as a woman,' the first lady told Parade 
magazine when asked about the birthday. She started the celebration last
 week by spending extra time with girlfriends in Hawaii after her 
family's holiday vacation there. It was an early birthday present from 
the president. On Saturday, she'll be toasted at a White House party 
where guests have been advised to come ready to dance, and to eat before
 they come.

Second 
presidential terms can be freeing for first ladies, just as they are for
 presidents, because there is no next election to fret over. But while 
Mrs. Obama is over the hump of her first lady tenure, with just three 
years remaining, it's unclear if she will take on new or different 
roles.

Asked whether she
 has peaked at 50, Mrs. Obama joked that being first lady is 'pretty 
high up.' She said she's always felt that her life is 'ever-evolving' 
and she doesn't have the right to 'just sit on my talents or blessings.'

'I've
 got to keep figuring out ways to have an impact, whether as a mother or
 as a professional or as a mentor to other kids,' the first lady said, 
noting that daughter Malia, now 15, will be in college when she and 
President Barack Obama leave the White House in January 2017. Daughter 
Sasha, 12, won't be far behind.

'Women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves': Michelle smiles while President Obama speaks at an event a day before her birthday. The former Michelle Robinson did not take to politics quickly in the shadow of her high wattage husband and was even a liability early on in his 2008 campaign. But she has evolved into a polished performer

'At that point in life, whoa, the sky is the limit,' Mrs. Obama said.

President Obama is planning a big birthday dance party for his wife at the White House on Saturday night. Aides are keeping a tight lid on details to maintain the element of surprise for Mrs. Obama. Guests have been told to come prepared to dance and to eat before they come.

'There's one thing I can tell you for sure ... people will move,' Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser who is close to the Obamas, told The Associated Press.

Jarrett wouldn't comment on reports that Beyonce, who also is close to the Obama family, will sing at the first lady's party. Beyonce serenaded the Obamas as they danced at one of the balls for the president's first inauguration in 2009. Last year, she lip-synced to a pre-recorded voice track of the national anthem at Obama's second swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol.

Coincidentally, Beyonce's husband, rapper and entrepreneur Jay Z, is scheduled to bring his Magna Carter World Tour to Washington's Verizon Center on Thursday night, two days before Mrs. Obama's White House birthday blowout. That means Beyonce could be in town anyway.
