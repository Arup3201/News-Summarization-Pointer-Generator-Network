It was a good question but it was hard to suppress a snort of derision: did Sebastian Vettel feel he had a moral obligation to take part in qualifying here for the US Grand Prix?

The context is that Formula One’s endlessly arcane rules mean that taking a sixth engine of the season — one more than the rules allow — would condemn him to start at the back of the grid, rendering his qualifying session pointless before he turns a wheel in competition.

So Vettel, the winner of last year’s race, who is facing that possibility, could sit out Saturday’s action or merely put in one lap to do what is necessary — it is called qualifying for a reason — to race on Sunday.

If so, fans at the undulating Circuit of the Americas here in Texas are entitled to feel short-changed when they are paying between £385 and £745 for main grandstand tickets. More so given that Caterham and Marussia, the two backmarkers who are in administration, will also be missing from the entire weekend’s action.

So, the moral teaser: did Vettel not feel obliged to get out on the track as much as possible?

‘You can talk about obligations, but in the end we have to manage the situation with the engines,’ said the German, knowing that morality and Formula One are not natural bedfellows.

‘The situation is what it is. I’d love to change it, to qualify in the normal way and use every practice session to the maximum.

‘But the rules are pretty clear. Once you decide to take a sixth engine, sixth turbo, all the pieces, you have to start from the pit lane, even if you qualify on pole.

‘So you would not want to burn mileage in qualifying that you would regret later in Brazil or Abu Dhabi, where you might not see the finish line. But I see your point, and it would be a real shame.’

Instead, Vettel gave a sprinkling of fans an exhibition on Austin’s streets yesterday afternoon. In the shadow of the Texas State Capitol building, he pulled doughnuts — rubber-burning wheel-spins — in an old Red Bull, its V8 engine screeching across the city.

Not that the noise level will be the same at the out-of-town circuit, the turbo engines with their low growl being a faint echo of the old banshee yell.

Given the plight of Caterham and Marussia, both of which are based in Britain, there will be plenty of introspection in the paddock this weekend. The chief question will be whether Formula One’s prize money and spending power is too concentrated among the bigger teams.

Tony Fernandes, the QPR chairman and airline magnate, believes so, having given up on Caterham after starting with all sorts of avowed ambitions.

‘People can blame whoever but the big teams are as much at fault as anyone,’ he told Sky. ‘The gap has become way too big and it is money. And so I thought, “Well, I can’t compete”. But I can compete at QPR; I can compete at Air Asia.

‘Rather than continue, you have got to be brave and say, “Look, we screwed up. You can’t compete; you thought you could and it is time to leave”. But the sport has to examine itself as well.’
