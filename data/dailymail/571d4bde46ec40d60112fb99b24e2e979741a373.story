In the wake of the tragic death of a 19-year-old freshman student who killed herself after being outed for appearing in a porn film, Duke porn star Belle Knox has written an open letter expressing her sympathy and revealing how she too has come close to suicide.

Knox, 18, whose real name is Miriam Weeks, wrote that she saw many parallels between her story and that of Alyssa Funke who took her own life last month after being mercilessly taunted over her decision to appear in a porn film.

Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body.

In an open letter, Belle Knox, left, has written that she saw many parallels between her life and that of Alyssa Funke, right, who killed herself last month after being mercilessly taunted over appearing in a porn film

She wrote on xoJane that she would see ‘chilling’ parallels between Funke's story and her own.

‘When I first heard your story, my eyes immediately filled with tears,’ she wrote. ‘That could’ve been how it all ended for me, too, I thought to myself.’

‘We were both straight A students. Like you, I have battled depression for years. I too was a freshman in college when I was outed as a porn performer.

‘We even shot for the same website, [CastingCouch-X] where I had an experience that traumatized me to this day. And, just like you, I was bullied relentlessly by my fellow students for my actions as a porn performer.’

Knox writes that she also considered killing herself, even imagining the headlines that would haunt her bullies forever, but felt ‘a flicker of hope’ that caused her to keep going.

‘You have shown me the other side of the tunnel, an ending I must never forget I could have just as easily taken.’

Knox doesn't blame the porn industry for Funke's suicide, but rallies against the stigma against porn and sex work that gives rise to cyber-bullying.

‘I wish I could have done something,' writes Knox, before going on list what she wishes she had been able to tell Funke before her death.

'I would have told you that it does get better, past the darkness - and that the ignorance of some asinine college students today would have no significance in your life in a few years, when you were a successful, bad-ass anesthesiologist just like you said you were going to be.

'You were an intelligent, beautiful, and compassionate young lady who, despite what everyone told you, did not ruin her life when you shot that scene.'

Stunningly beautiful, straight-A chemistry student Funke took her own life with a 12-gauge shotgun on April 16, just weeks after she dabbled in the seedy world of amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for her decision.

Funke went to Las Vegas for her interview with CastingCouch-X in March where she called herself Stella Ann. She appeared nervous on the tape and talked about her real dreams of becoming an anesthesiologist

Miss Funke decided to take part in a sex video with a stranger in Las Vegas for website CastingCouch-X, using the name 'Stella Ann'.

Days after the sex tape of the teenager, from Stillwater, Minnesota, was posted online in March, abusive messages flooded her social media accounts, many from her former schoolmates at Stillwater High. 

The messages, ranged from gossipy and sarcastic to nasty slurs about the University of Wisconsin student.

High school students had reportedly gathered around tables in the cafeteria to watch the teen's sex tape on their cellphones, according to KMSP-TV. One called Miss Funke a 'thot', a slang word for prostitute, adding: 'Does her dad know?'

Another message sniped: 'Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year.'

Miss Funke fought back - defending herself. She tweeted: 'Pornstar status' and 'FAMOUS for dayzzzzz.'

During her interview for the amateur porn site in March, Alyssa Funke, who called herself 'Ann' looked nervous and described her college plans and described her childhood as 'pretty much normal'

The last message she posted on 
Facebook on March 4 read: 'The people that envy & hate you the most,
 stalk you on social media the most so, hey hi hello how r u doing, this
 ones for you.'

She wrote a 
post to her 'future husband' and about vulnerable message about wanting a
 relationship where you 'never feel unwanted or alone'.

The 19-year-old did not know the easiest of childhoods, despite describing her past with a shrug in her porn video interview as 'pretty much' normal.

Her biological father Rashad Bowman was jailed in 2001 for fraud in Maricopa County, Arizona.

Court records show that as a young girl, Alyssa tried to keep in contact with her father using audio tapes.

The teenage college student had a troubled upbringing with her father in jail in Arizona and her mother and a boyfriend arrested for dealing drugs

Her mother and a boyfriend were 
charged with drug-dealing. Family told KMSP-TV that the teenager had 
money worries and struggled with depression.

Despite
 brushing off the taunts from her peers, the words affected her, family 
said. On April 17, the teenager bought a shotgun, drove to Big Carnelia 
Lake and killed herself on her family's boat.

Her devastated family, who have been unwilling to speak publicly on her tragic death, launched The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund, which raised just $165.

On the site, a family message reads: 'On Wednesday April 16, at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her 
own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and 
sadly the bullying lead to her death.'

According to KMSP-TV, Miss Funke's video remains on their website. Attempts to contact the site have so far been unsuccessful.

The local sheriff's office is investigating the teenager's death but does not believe that the messages sent to Miss Funke amount to criminal harassment.
