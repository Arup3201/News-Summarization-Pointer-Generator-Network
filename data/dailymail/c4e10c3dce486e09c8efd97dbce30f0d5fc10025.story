When hapless Islamic State militants vowed to take over Rome and 'throw homosexuals off the leaning tower of pizza', Italians responded with a flood of mocking responses.

Now, Twitter users have jokingly suggested other culinary hotspots for militants to visit with the hashtag #jihadifoodtour.

If they're planning a visit to the UK, jihadi tourists can take in the 'London Pie', 'Sconehenge', 'Big Ben and Jerrys' and the 'Angel Cake of the North'.

Jihadi joke: A popular new hashtag on Twitter suggests other food-based places for jihadis to visit

Sconehenge! Amy on Twitter suggested jihadis visit the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire

The trend was started on tonight's episode of The Last Leg on Channel 4, presented by comedian Adam Hills

A tweet from the programme' account referred to a blunder by an ISIS supporter who threatened to invade Italy's 'leaning tower of PIZZA'

Other must-visit foodie destinations suggested include the 'Trifle Tower', 'The Great Wall of Quinoa' and the 'Sydney Okra House'.

The trend was started on tonight's episode of The Last Leg on Channel 4, where comedians Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker look at the week's events.

After introducing the trend, Hills kicked things off with 'Empire Steak Building' and Widdicombe responded with 'Battenburg Gate'. 

The programme's account on Twitter wrote: 'This week's poll! What other food-based monuments should Jihadi march on? #jihadifoodtour'.

Popular suggestions included  the 'London Pie', 'Big Ben and Jerrys'' and the 'Angel Cake of the North'

It was referring to a blunder made by an Islamic State supporter last week - who mistakenly confused to the Leaning Tower of Pisa with the dish Italians are famous for.

And response on Twitter was an overwhelming torrent of food-based puns, with some users going a step further and mocking up memes of the 'London Pie' and 'Sconehenge'. 

He had threatened to bring sharia law to the Italian capital in a message, posted on a Twitter account linked to the terror group. 

The announcement came days after masked jihadists revealed their intention to conquer the city in a video that showed the mass beheading of 21 Christians in Libya.

But rather than spark widespread panic, the threats triggered a flood of mocking responses - with dozens taking to social media to make fun of the jihadists and their takeover plans.
