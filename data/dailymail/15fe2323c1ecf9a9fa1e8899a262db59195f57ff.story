A California woman says she woke up from shoulder surgery only to find a series of increasingly creepy text messages from her anesthesiologist nurse.

Darcy White told reporters she was only set for some reconstructive surgery and didn't remember much until waking up Monday.

That's when she found the disturbing messages on her phone.

California woman Darcy White says a nurse got her cell phone number while she was in for the hospital for surgery, then proceeded to text her inappropriate personal messages

'The next thing I remember is waking up Monday morning and reading through a series of text messages and call logs,' she told KERO Bakersfield. 

She said the nurse not only commented on her appearance in the messages but her clothing size as well. 

A friend, Randall Anthony, was with her at the hospital and says he witnessed the harassment. 

'It continued and then on Monday, she said he called again and she already called the hospital I think,' he said. 

The messages grew increasingly personal and commented on White's appearance and clothing size

The unidentified nurse admitted to reporters that he had gotten White's number from her file as well as crossing a line with his calls after surgery. 

However he declined a further interview. 

The nurse is not an employee of Mercy Hospital where the surgery took place.

'Patient privacy and safety are top priorities for Dignity Health Mercy Hospitals. We are aware of the allegations and there is currently an ongoing investigation. Because the nurse is not an employee of Mercy Hospitals, we are prohibited from making any further comments in this personnel matter,' the hospital wrote in a statement.

The unidentified nurse was not an employee at Mercy Hospital but the institution says an investigation is ongoing

Anthony doesn't buy the nurse's excuses.

He told reporters: 'I said, 'let's call him back' and she handed me the phone and I called him and he proceeded to tell em that he was doing his job following up and I said, 'you called ten times and text?'
