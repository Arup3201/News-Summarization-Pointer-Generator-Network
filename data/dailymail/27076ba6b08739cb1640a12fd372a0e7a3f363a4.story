Her family flew into New Zealand on December 29, remaining at her side until she passed away on Sunday night.

Ms Dargusch had been travelling with her boyfriend of two years, Jared Wilford, and a group of friends.

The couple and three friends were walking on the Kaueranga Valley Track on their way to see a watering hole. 

The young Queensland woman accidentally fell down a cliff face when the group stopped to swim, according to Waikato District Command Centre Senior Sergeant Ruper Friend.

“Standing 5-7 metres above the hole on a ledge she was described as watching two friends jumping into the water when she appears to have lost her footing and fallen on to a large slate of rock below suffering critical injuries,” he said.
