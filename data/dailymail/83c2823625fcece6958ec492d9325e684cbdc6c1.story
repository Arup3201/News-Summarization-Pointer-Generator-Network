A British Airways plane had to be grounded shortly before take-off after a stowaway mouse was discovered on board the trans-Atlantic flight.

As the 350 passengers were waiting to jet off to New York they found their flight was cancelled, with staff revealing there was a rodent problem.

One mouse had been spotted on the plane, meaning pest control specialists had to be called to Heathrow Airport to find it before the aircraft was allowed to take off again.

Runaway rodent: Around 350 passengers had been preparing to leave Heathrow Airport when they were told a mouse had been spotted on the plane

The airline made the decision to ground the plane because of the potential damage the hungry mouse could have done to the aircraft.

It is understood that it took several hours to find the runaway rodent, while passengers who had been due to fly to the US on Friday were offered an alternative flight the following day.

One passenger said: 'I was going to New York just for the weekend so it was no good to me to be delayed until the Saturday.

'I refused the alternative flight and instead got offered Â£100 BA vouchers.

'But I couldn't believe it when they said the flight was cancelled because of a mouse. That's never happened to me before.

'It sounded like a joke but I suppose you can understand their concern that themouse might have nibbled through a vital cable.'

A British Airways spokesman said there had been no option but to ground the plane.

Final destination: Passengers were offered an alternative flight to New York for the following day

'We're sorry that we had to move customers onto alternative New York flights after their original flight was cancelled,' he said.

'Cancelling a flight is always a last resort, but we took the precaution of searching for the mouse to prevent it from damaging any of the aircraft's systems.

'A mouse was caught and removed and the aircraft is now back in service.'
