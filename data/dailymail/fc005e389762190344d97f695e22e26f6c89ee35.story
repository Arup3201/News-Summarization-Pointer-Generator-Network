However the team from Merseyside were bowled out for just three runs in response, one of the lowest totals in the sport's history.

News of the shockingly low score by spread fast on Twitter and attracted comment as far away as Australia where fans are still celebrating their resounding Ashes victory.

Piers Morgan also joined in, posting a photo of their bleak scorecard on the social media site.

Wirral
 thought they had a good chance of beating Haslington in the TACS 
Partnership Cheshire League Division Three match after bowling out their
 opponents for 108 in yesterday's clash.

Wirral had won their opening match of the campaign the previous week and one of the players, Matt Garrett, 24, said: 'It was a bit of a pudding of a wicket but we had chased down a score of more than 200 to win last week and were confident we could get close to their score.

'However there was some good line and length bowling from them, and some poor shot selection from us, and we began to crumble as the pressure built up. 

'It was just one of those days - you 
don't expect the first 10 batsmen all to get ducks. It was one of those 
strange things - that's why we love the game of cricket.'

The only run was scored by the number 11 batsman, Connor Hodson, and the highest scorer was extras - there were two leg byes.

Accepting defeat: The club posted a light-heated message about their loss on Twitter after the game

Scorecard: The batting performances are much to be desired with number 10, Chris Hobson, top scoring with just one run

Mr Garrett, who is studying sports development and physical education at Liverpool John Moores University, said: 'I hear it's even in the news in Australia. It was just dying down after they beat us 5-0 in the Ashes and we've prodded the beast again.'

The team has its third league match of the season next week.

'I think we'll do better,' Mr Garrett said. 'Well, we can't do much worse.'

The club have asked former England internationals Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff, Phil Tufnell and David Lloyd for some coaching via social media.

Embarrassed captain Peter Clewes later admitted: 'It was not my best day as captain. We chased down 203 last week. It was all going so well!"

Batsman Ronnie Gambles - out LBW after 12 balls - joked: 'I was rock solid for 12 balls until I tried to take it to the opposition with an attacking shot.

'Both leg byes were down to me. I got the scoreboard ticking and nearly got them to make a change bowling wise!

'To sum up a top day's cricket and being all out for 3 the showers at Haslington were cold.'

However, it is not the lowest score in cricketing. Langport from Somerset were bowled out for zero after taking on Glastonbury in 1915.

The lowest score in a first-class match is six, made by "The B's" against England at the old Lord's ground in 1810.

And the lowest total in a Test match is 26, posted by New Zealand against England in 1955.

Celebrity abuse: Piers Morgan joined in the global mocking of the team, posting an image of the bottom of the scorecard on his Twitter profile
