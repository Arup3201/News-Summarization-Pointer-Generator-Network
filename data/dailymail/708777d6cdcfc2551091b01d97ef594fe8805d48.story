Astronomers around the world are 
tracking with eager anticipation the arrival of a comet next year which 
could even outshine our Moon in the night sky.

Comet ISON is expected to draw 
millions into the dark to witness what is likely to be the most 
brilliant comet seen in many generations.

It is visiting the inner solar system 
for what is thought to be the first time and is set to put on 
spectacular views for the Northern Hemisphere across November and 
December as it heads towards the sun.

Look to the skies next year: Comet ISON could produce a spectacular show when it flies by next year - similar to the 1997 appearance of Hale-Bopp (pictured)

It may prove to be brighter than any 
comet of the last century - visible even in daylight - and this may end 
up being its one and only trip to the solar system, as its trajectory 
may see it plunge into the sun in a fiery death.

It is currently moving inwards from 
beyond Jupiter, and as it approaches the Earth, the 'dirty snowball' 
could produce a dazzling display, burning brighter than the moon and 
potentially being visible in broad daylight.

Astronomer Dr David Whitehouse, 
writing in The Independent, says the comet will be visible to the naked 
eye in the night sky by late November.

'Its tail could stretch like a searchlight into the sky above the horizon,' Dr Whitehouse writes.

'Then it will swing rapidly around the
 Sun, passing within two million miles of it, far closer than any planet
 ever does, to emerge visible in the evening sky heading northward 
towards the pole star.

'It could be an "unaided eye" object 
for months. When it is close in its approach to the Sun it could become 
intensely brilliant but at that stage it would be difficult and 
dangerous to see without special instrumentation as it would be only a 
degree from the sun.'

The comet, which was discovered by 
astronomers using the International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) 
telescope in Russia, will pass within two million miles of the sun's 
surface - making it a 'sun-grazing' comet.

It is on a 'parabolic' orbit, which 
means it probably originated from the outer skirts of the solar system, 
perhaps from the Oort cloud - a mass of icy debris which lies 50,000 
times further from the sun than the Earth does.

If comet ISON survives the encounter, 
it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the 
comet passes back through the inner solar system.

Comets are dusty balls of ice, which generally originate from the Kuipler belt - a region of icy small bodies beyond Neptune.

Occasionally, a comet gets dislodged from its orbit, and plunges in to the inner solar system.

They differ from asteroids, which are made of metal or rock, and are usually the left over remnants of planets or moons.

Comets are not really reflective - they only reflect 4 per cent of the the Sun's rays, about the same as coal.

So although they look brilliantly white from Earth, they are black at the surface.

Halley's comet is the most well-known, named after Edmond Halley who noted the regular 75-76-year appearance of a comet, and predicted it would return in 1758, although sadly the astronomer died 16 years before he was proved correct.

Halley's comet has passed within a fraction of the Earth before - in 1910 the Earth even moved through the comet's tail.

Sadly, the 1986 re-appearance was the worst for 2,000 years, as the Earth and the comet were on opposite sides of the sun.

The comet will begin brightening once 
it gets within Jupiter's orbit, as the sun's heat begins boiling the ice
 locked within the comet, converting it directly into gas.

It is likely to recall the excitement 
of Comet Hale-Bopp, which sailed past the Earth in 1997, appearing as a 
static-looking smear in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere.

It is also set to outshine 'the 
greatest comet of the last century' - Comet McNaught, which shone 
brighter than Venus as it passed above the southern hemisphere in 1965.

Comets are known as 'dirty snowballs',
 although technically a better definition would be 'snowy dirtballs', as
 comets are generally rocky at the surface, with chemical-laden ice 
within the interior.

As the ice and chemicals heat up, they
 erupt as brilliant jets which can form tails lasting hundreds of 
thousands of kilometres in length.

The comet is expected to be bright throughout late November and early December.

Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'This is a very exciting discovery.

'The comet looks like it could become a
 very spectacular sight in the evening sky after sunset from the UK in 
late November and early December next year.

'Our members will be eagerly following
 it as it makes its first trip around the Sun and hoping to see it 
shining brilliantly and displaying a magnificent tail as it releases 
powerful jets of gas and dust.'
