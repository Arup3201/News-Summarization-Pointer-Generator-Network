Gisele Bundchen has slammed advertisements that promote 'unattainable' beauty. 

The Brazilian supermodel - who is the new face of Chanel's No 5 fragrance - said that while ads for such brands can be seen as 'aspirational,' they are often  a distant reality for the majority of women.

The 34-year-old beauty told The Sunday Times Style magazine: 'Sometimes I feel like adverts like this can make women feel so distant.

Unrealistic: Gisele Bundchen, who is the new face of Chanel No 5, has slammed advertisements that promote 'unattainable' beauty 

Conscious effort: Ms Bundchen, seen in a new short film for Chanel No 5, insists that the fashion house has tried to make its latest campaign more relatable to regular women

Of course, some might call the leggy model - who plays a glamorous surfing mom in a short film released by Chanel last week - a tad hypocritical. 

 'They are so glamorous and so unattainable and so aspirational that you really can't touch them, in a way. They are kind of a dream,' she continues.

However, Ms Bundchen insists that the Parisian fashion house has made a conscious effort to make its latest campaign more relatable to regular women.

Art imitates life: Ms Bundchen, seen in the new Chanel film, said her character 'is a mother, a wife and a professional, and she is juggling all of that, and you know that's not easy'

'The idea really was to show this modern woman and all that she is, with her struggles and her vulnerability. And yes, she is glamorous. Of course she's glamorous - she is powerful and successful - but she is also struggling,' she said.

'You know she is a mother, a wife and a professional, and she is juggling all of that, and you know that's not easy,' continued Ms Bundchen, who is mother to Vivian, 22 months, Benjamin, four, and a stepson Jack, seven, with her husband, NFL star Tom Brady. 

Chanel unveiled the short video directed by Baz Luhrmann last week, which sees Ms Bundchen's character trying to balance her personal life with her role as a mother to a young daughter.

Empowering: 'We want to have more than just to be the pretty woman who sits there,' Ms Bundchen said

"In a way Gisele became the script,' Mr Luhrmann told Vogue UK. 'I knew her when she was quite young and starting out, and she's evolved so much in both her life and work. The film reflects that - this woman has a child, a real job and then she has this relationship. Gisele is the Chanel woman now.'

The stunning mom also stressed the importance of balancing her busy work schedule with raising her children, believing it is 'empowering' when women like herself are able to perform both roles.

She said: 'We are all trying to juggle these different parts, and it's not easy. No matter how much work you put in, no matter how glamorous it looks. We always put pressure on ourselves.

'We should be allowed to dream and to want more. We want to have more than just to be the pretty woman who sits there. I think that it's a very empowering thing for me to be able to be successful in my job and not feel like I need to sacrifice being a mother.'
