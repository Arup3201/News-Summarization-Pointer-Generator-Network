Hunt: Police today named Nathan Davis in connection with the investigation

Police hunting a killer driver who mowed down a woman at a bus stop have today named the owner of the vehicle as part of the investigation.

Detectives said they were looking for Nathan Davis, who has been linked to the Audi involved.

Veronica Chango-Alvarez, 31, died in her brother's arms outside the family home after the car mounted the pavement and hit her.

The driver of the same car had earlier fled an accident scene when officers tried to speak to him.

Today the Metropolitan Police Service also issued a picture of Davis as part of their public appeal into the death.

A
spokesman for the service said: 'Police are appealing for assistance to
trace a man they wish to speak to in connection with a collision in 
Croydon, south London.'

Nathan Davis, aged 27 years, has been linked to vehicle in question but police emphasised he is not the registered owner.

Police were first called to a crash 
at 5.20am on Saturday, December 22, after a Volkswagen Passat had hit a 
tree in London Road, Croydon, at the junction with Ederline Avenue.

'It is believed that an Audi A3 stopped at the scene of the incident and the driver got out of the car,' said the spokesman.

'Plain
clothes officers, who had been on duty nearby, identified themselves as
police officers. Upon the arrival of police, the driver of the Audi 
made off from the scene in his car.

'At around 5.30am the same Audi was involved in a collision with two people on Streatham High Road.

'A woman, believed to have been standing at a bus stop on Streatham High Road, was pronounced dead at the scene.

'She
is believed to be Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alvarez, aged 31 years. She 
was staying at her mother's home in Streatham High Road.'

A
51-year-old man, also believed to have been at the bus stop, was taken 
by ambulance to a south London hospital, where his condition remained 
critical.

The driver of the car left the scene on foot before police arrived, abandoning the damaged Audi.

The
29-year-old driver of the Volkswagen from the earlier crash was taken 
to hospital, where his condition was today described as stable.

Veronica's
brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alvarez said: 'On Saturday our family lost my
sister Veronica, when she was hit by a car outside our family home.

'My family has had its heart torn out at this Christmas time. We will never be the same again.

Probe: The Audi which hit the victim in Streatham had minutes earlier been at the scene when a VW hit a tree in nearby Ederline Avenue, Croydon. Police believe the two cars may have been racing

'On Friday night we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas.

'I
last saw her alive as she left to go to work on Saturday morning but 
moments later I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street. 
We as a family are devastated at our loss.'

Detective
Inspector Gordon Wallace, said: 'This was a horrific collision where a 
young woman was killed outside the family home as she waited for a bus 
on her way to work.

'The family are devastated; the memory of this senseless death will be with them each time they leave their home.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
