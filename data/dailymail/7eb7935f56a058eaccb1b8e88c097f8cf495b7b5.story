When the BBC refurbished its London HQ at a cost of £1billion, its staff looked forward to settling into their new office space.

But a draconian directive from bosses has made sure they don't make themselves too comfortable.

They have been urged not to bring in plants, kettles, microwaves, fridges or coat-stands.

'Territorial': BBC bosses have banned pot plants from the office (file photo)

The memo said foliage could be used as a form of 'desk-grab' to mark out 
territory and 'form un-collaborative barriers' with colleagues.

It said:  'Plants give a strong sense of 
ownership of a particular desk or area when we would like staff to feel 
much more mobile and flexible across the open plan floor plates.

'They have been used to form un-collaborative barriers between teams and individuals.'

The email also warned: 'Some people are allergic to certain plants and they also attract insects which we don't want sharing our workplace.'

Order: Staff at New Broadcasting House were sent the memo from bosses

Coat-stands have been banned 'to keep the line of vision clear' while waste paper baskets have been jettisoned in favour of 'recycling hubs'.

Many electrical appliances – such as fans, kettles and microwaves – have also been barred in case they set off fire alarms.

Yesterday one angry BBC worker said: 'It is totally 
unnecessary. You have to trust your own staff to make some of their own 
decisions.

Boiling point: Kettles have also fallen foul of the Beeb's management

'If someone wants to bring in a plant to liven up their desk, 
why not let them?

'It is a typically bossy, infantilising email of the 
kind we have come to expect from BBC managers.'

Staff were asked to watch a short film explaining the rules of New Broadcasting House. It said: 'W1 will have state of the art heating and air conditioning as well as fully equipped catering hubs.

'Because of this there'll be no space for your kettles, microwaves, fridges, plants, lamps, heaters or fans.'

Interior design expert Coll Smith said the decision to ban pot plants was 'bizarre'.

She said: 'Research for the past 30 years has shown that plants are really beneficial to the occupants of offices and workspaces.

'A recent study showed that lean or bare office spaces are not conducive to getting the best from employees.

'Adding decoration including plants improves productivity and when workers are empowered to take control of their workspace.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'There's no official 'ban' on plants. We'd just prefer it if people didn't bring them in.'
