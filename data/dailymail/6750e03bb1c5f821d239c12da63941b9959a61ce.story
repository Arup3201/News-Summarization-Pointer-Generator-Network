The artist granddaughter of Winston Churchill displayed an obvious lack of diplomacy Tuesday when she and her husband stole a taxi in New York City from a woman about to get inside and then cursed at her and gave her the finger.

'Go f**k yourself,' yelled Edwina Sandys at a Palm Beach, Florida, socialite when she dared to protest.

Though raised the daughter of a British politician and granddaughter of a worldwide legend, Sandys has evidently learned to live as a local after decades living in New York City.

Underhanded: Edwina Sandys reportedly stole a cab from a Palm Beach socialite in front of the Time Warner Center in Manhattan on Tuesday

Along for the misbegotten taxi ride was Sandys' American husband Richard Kaplan, according to Page Six.

'That was my cab,' the flummoxed socialite said. 'That wasn’t very nice.'

Sandys reportedly responded with a lewd hand gesture as she sped away from Manhattan's Time Warner Center.

'We were dumbfounded,' a witness said.

Win some, lose some: Sandys is an acclaimed artist, and her famous grandfather was known to be handy with a paintbrush, but she doesn't seem to have inherited his political finesse

Rude: The granddaughter of Winston Churchill was with her husband Richard Kaplan when she made the rude gesture and remarks

Asked about her behavior by Page Six's Richard Johnson, Sandys demurred.

'I don’t remember having an argument,' she said. 'But this is New York.'

Despite her apparently standoffish demeanor, Sandys has won international acclaim for her work as a sculptor, painter, and collagist.

While she clearly did not inherit her grandfather's panache for the political, he too is known to have been a skillful painter.
