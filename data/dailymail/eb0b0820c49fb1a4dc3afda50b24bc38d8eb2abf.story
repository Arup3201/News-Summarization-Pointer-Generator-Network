Jailed: Darius Kersys stole more than £100,000 from his next door neighbour after he died

A fraudster has been jailed after stealing more than £100,000 charity cash from his dead neighbour.

Darius Kersys, 37, syphoned off £112,000 from the bank account of 86-year-old neighbour William Carrington, who lived next door, following his death in October 2010.

The generous pensioner had left the money in his will to be split equally between three charities: Guide Dogs for the Blind, the National Asthma Campaign and Cancer Research UK.

Kersys, who moved to England from Lithuania with his family, blew the cash on lavish spending sprees and bought a £22,500 Audi Q7 luxury 4x4, a Playstation games console and a top of the range mountain bike.

Today the unrepentant conman was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.

His pregnant wife, who was found guilty of possession of criminal property, was given an eight-month suspended sentence and ordered to undergo 80 hours of unpaid work.

Recorder Matthew Lowe said: 'You, Darius Kersys, befriended your neighbour and came into possession of his house key.

'You went onto take advantage of not only his death, but his lonely and isolated life.

'You set about using his bank card, plundering money from his bank account.

'Having obtained the money, you spent it on a motor vehicle and home improvements - not money spent on life essentials.

'As you became greedier you became bolder in what you were doing, organising transfers of significant sums.

'You spent the money on a motor vehicle and home improvements - this was not money spent on life essentials.

'This was a mean-spirited and nasty piece of offending which involved exploiting not only the death, but also the lonely and isolated life, of your next door neighbour.

'Inga Kersiene, though not involved in the fraud, you befitted significantly from the fraud.'

A trial at Southend Crown Court in January heard how the 'unsophisticated' fraudster, from Southend, Essex, transferred thousands of pounds from Mr Carrington's savings account directly into his own account.

Kersys also used Mr Carrington's bank card for extravagant shopping sprees as he enjoyed an affluent lifestyle well beyond his meagre income.

Trust: The couple lived next door to William Carrington who left his money to three charities when he died

Mr Carrington died at Southend Hospital on October 26, 2010.

The generous pensioner had requested in his will that his hard-earned savings to be split equally between three charities: Guide Dogs for the Blind, the National Asthma Campaign and Cancer Research UK.

Mr Carrington received a new Visa debit card at his home address in August 2010 shortly before his death.

Mr Kersys used a key, given to him in good faith by his elderly neighbour before his death, to intercept cards and PIN codes in the post.

The court heard how mother-of-three Mrs Kersiene is 12-weeks pregnant with the couple's fourth child

Three months after Mr Carrington's death in January 2011 he was registered for internet banking and large money transfers began to occur from his savings account across to his current account.

Kersys then used the Visa card and PIN code to purchase items at a number of high street stores including Next, Tesco, Comet, B&Q and Halfords throughout early 2011.

Purchases included an Apollo mountain bike, Tom Tom satellite navigation system and a grey suede jacket.

Receipts for these purchases - and the mountain bike itself - were later found at the Lithuanian couple's home address in St Mary's Road, Southend, when police searched the property in January last year 2012.

Large sums of money were also transferred from Mr Carrington's current account directly into Kersys' bank account throughout early 2011 before bank staff became suspicious of unusual activity in the pensioner's account.

Investigators obtained Mr Carrington's death certificate in May 2011 and soon traced the payments back to Kersys.

A total of £112,000 was drained from the account before suspicious bank staff stepped in.

Shameless Kersys attempted to claim he had befriended the elderly pensioner shortly before his death and that Mr Carrington had allowed him to blow the charity cash.

Kersiene claimed she had no idea her husband had received the money dishonestly.

But the jury refused to believe either account and both were unanimously found guilty following the four-day trial.

Kersys was found guilty of three counts of fraud by false representation while his wife, Inga Kersiene, 39, was found guilty of possession of criminal property.

Today, the court heard how mother-of-three Mrs Kersiene is 12-weeks pregnant with the couple's fourth child.

Mike Warren, mitigating for Mrs Kersiene, said: 'They have three children - 13, 11 and nine - and she has advised me she is now 12 weeks pregnant. 

'She had been working as a carer before her arrest for these matters but she is now relying on job seekers allowance only.

'It would appear that there is about £12,000 negative equity on their home. 

'She has made an approach, which I believe has been approved, for interest payments to be paid by the benefits agency.'

John McNally, mitigating for Mr Kersys, said his client was 'truly ashamed' of his actions.

He told the court: 'At 37 years old, he is truly ashamed of himself.

'He has had to cope with the shame of having his children visit him in prison.

'For a man who has come from Lithuania to make a something of his life, he has now fallen very far.'
