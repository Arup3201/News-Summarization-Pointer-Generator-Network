The best man is supposed to take care of planning the bachelor party, take care of the wedding rings and maybe make a speech at some stage during the night.

But one man went above and beyond his call of duty to help the groom - raising more than $7,000 when Christina Scheuplein and Ray De Santiago's life savings were stolen from their California home a week before the big day.

'They ransacked the house, completely turned everything upside down,' best man, and the bride's uncle, Cameron Scheuplein said.

Ray De Santiago and Christina Scheuplein were burglarized of $6,000 they had saved for their wedding a week before the ceremony

'Ray lost his job two months ago, so his budget was already very tight, he told Good Morning America. 'He was very stressed this last weekend about getting through the week. It was just crushing. It was actually show-stopping.'

The engaged couple, whose home was broken into along with seven others in their neighborhood, was suddenly left frantically trying to think of every possible way to cut costs.

'They were considering no flowers, I was going to get ordained because they couldn't afford the officiant, and they were thinking of having friends run the bar because they couldn't afford the bartenders,' Mr Scheuplein said.

But the 33-year-old turned to social media instead, setting up a fundraising page and asking friends and family in La Puente to donate what they could for the couple.

Two days later, the original $6,000 that had been stolen had been donated back to the pair, allowing the couple to go through with their original plan for an Italian-style wedding at a villa in Sierra Madre, California.

But it didn't stop there; the donations kept rolling in, and soon the couple found themselves with an extra $1,000.

The best man and Christiana Scheuplein's uncle Cameron Scheuplein took matters into his own hands, taking to social media to raise the money himself

The best man raised around $7,000 for the couple, whose house had been ransacked along with seven other homes only a few days before

'We're going to use that (extra) money to buy a home security system and get a nice safe to put our valuables in to protect our home from any future problems," said Mr De Santiago.

His bride-to-be added: `I'm so overwhelmed with emotion. We went from a period of devastation to going on and being able to do these wonderful wedding things without having to stress.'
