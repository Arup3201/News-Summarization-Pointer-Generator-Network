It's the kind of European night that Liverpool fans have been craving for years. 

Anfield will be rocking when Real Madrid come to town, but can Brendan Rodgers’ side topple the European champions? 

Sportsmail’s top pundits give their verdicts...

How do you stop Madrid?

MARTIN KEOWN: Madrid are lethal on the break and Brendan Rodgers will have looked at how they destroyed Bayern last season. 

Without Bale and Di Maria, they have lost some of that speed, but then there’s Ronaldo. Him running at Lovren and Skrtel is a recipe for disaster. 

It will be interesting to see if Liverpool stay with a diamond or maybe use two deep midfielders to offer more protection.

JAMIE CARRAGHER: It is essential that Liverpool’s full backs only go forward when it is absolutely necessary. You have to guard against the way Madrid counter attack at blistering pace and they can’t be given opportunities to speed forward. 

JAMIE REDKNAPP: We all know about Madrid’s speed on the counter but they are a big, powerful side and so dangerous at set-pieces. They scored two in the semi-final against Bayern Munich last season and again against Atletico Madrid in the final.

Sergio Ramos being out will help that but it will be very difficult for Liverpool. They must stay strong and Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen have to look after that midfield.

So, how can Liverpool win? 

REDKNAPP: You have to look at Sterling because he is the stand-out player. If Liverpool can get him on the ball, he will frighten any defender. But the way Liverpool have been defending this season, I don’t think they will keep a clean sheet. The only way they can beat Madrid is to match them in attack and out-score them.

KEOWN: They should be licking their lips at the prospect of playing Madrid. Of course it’s a tough game but they should relish the challenge. They have to work the ball well, moving it on quickly and accurately when they are in possession, and a lot depends on the speed of Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho. But the players must enjoy the occasion and draw from it, not be fearful of it.

CARRAGHER: By getting back to how they were last season. They need to be aggressive and intense in their play, start quick and get Madrid on the back foot. If they do that, they will have another weapon to use - the Anfield crowd.

Should Rodgers play Mario Balotelli? 

KEOWN: Absolutely. If you invest £16million in a player and aren’t prepared to play him after a few games it reflects badly on you. He has to be given the chance to continue the club’s tradition of great strikers. But to do so tonight has to be his greatest night in a Liverpool shirt.

CARRAGHER: No. I would go for Sterling as the main striker with Adam Lallana and Coutinho supporting him. Sterling can get in behind a defence but he will also press. Mario Balotelli isn’t doing either at the minute. 

Sportsmail's Three Wise Men are split on whether Mario Balotelli should start for Liverpool against Madrid

REDKNAPP: I’ve never really taken to him - he acts like a genius but he doesn’t play like one - but I would probably still start him. 

I can’t see Sterling working as a central striker and though Rickie Lambert would work his socks of, he’s not match-fit. 

Balotelli has to pray he turns it on, otherwise it could be the end of his relationship with the fans. They won’t tolerate much more.

The Liverpool squad appeared in good spirits on Tuesday as they prepare for the visit of mighty Real Madrid

What's your prediction?

CARRAGHER: 1-1. Real Madrid might be favourites but there is no chance Liverpool will lie down at home.

REDKNAPP: I agree with Jamie. I’ve played enough times at Anfield to know how much the crowd can lift the team. Madrid will win the home game but I’ve got a feeling Liverpool can sneak a draw on Wednesday night. 1-1.

KEOWN: The electric Anfield atmosphere could power Liverpool to a special performance, so we could be in for a thriller. But I still feel Madrid are too strong. A 2-1 away win for the Spaniards.
