Motor racing supremo Bernie Ecclestone appeared in court yesterday on bribery charges which could see him jailed.

The 83-year-old billionaire admits paying £27million to a German banker who was handling the sale of part of the Formula One business.

He denies it was a bribe to ensure the stake went to his preferred buyer, claiming he was blackmailed and paid up to avoid false claims being made about his tax affairs.

Bernie Ecclestone has arrived at a Munich courtroom today for the start of a five-month trial that could see him jailed for ten years

The result of the bribery case will also shape the future of Formula One, the billion-dollar sport Ecclestone has controlled like a puppeteer for close on 40 years

‘The
 sun is shining, I am confident,’ said the 5ft 2in Ecclestone as he 
arrived at the court in Munich for the case, which could end his control
 over the sport he has run for almost four decades.

There was 
laughter as Judge Peter Noll – who has previously said he viewed 
Ecclestone with suspicion – asked him to clarify his marital status.

‘It
 says in the indictment that you are divorced,’ said the judge. ‘I 
thought you were married.’

Ecclestone, who was divorced by his 6ft 2in 
second wife Slavica – mother of his daughters Tamara and Petra – in 2009
 and married a Brazilian nearly 50 years his junior in 2012, replied: 
‘Both are right. I like to remember the divorce part.’

The 
prosecution case is detailed in a 256-page document which one newspaper 
described as ‘painting a picture of a man desperate to protect his 
sporting empire at all costs’.

Ecclestone
 said at the beginning of a four-hour personal statement read out in 
German by his lawyers that he was 'grateful' to be able to give his side
 of the story - though he told judges that he would answer questions 
from the Munich state court through his lawyers, rather than personally.

The
 83-year-old is charged with bribery and incitement to breach of trust, 
and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Flanked by his lawyers and with an interpreter at his side, he confirmed the pronunciation of his name and his date of birth to judge Peter Noll

Ecclestone, a former used-car salesman who became a billionaire by building the sport into a global money spinner over the past four decades, denies wrongdoing and says he will fight to clear his name

In
 today's statement, Ecclestone reiterated evidence he gave at 
Gribkowsky's trial that he gave the banker the money because he was 
'blackmailed' and worried Gribkowsky would falsely accuse of him of 
being in charge of a trust fund set up for the Formula One boss's former
 wife and their children - possibly incurring a huge British tax bill.

Ecclestone said that 'from today's point of view, it was not a rational decision' to pay Gribkowsky.

'I
 saw my life's work in danger' if Gribkowsky went to the British tax 
authorities, he said, adding that he would not have been able to pay the
 resulting bill.

Ecclestone,
 a former used-car salesman who became a billionaire by building the 
sport into a global money spinner over the past four decades, denies 
wrongdoing and says he will fight to clear his name.

CVC
 remains the largest shareholder in Formula One, a business that 
generates annual revenues of over $1.5 billion from its series of grand 
prix races held around the world.

CVC co-chairman Donald Mackenzie has said he would fire Ecclestone if he was found guilty of wrongdoing.

At the heart of the 256-page indictment against Ecclestone is the accusation that he paid a bribe of £27million to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to maintain his control over Formula One

Prosecutors say that Gribkowsky, therefore, steered the sale of the sport to CVC, a private equity firm that had agreed to retain Ecclestone as F1's chief executive when they bought a majority shareholding in 2006

He is accused of giving a $45m (£27.5m; 33m euros) bribe to a German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to secure the sale of a stake in the F1 business to a company he favoured.

The allegation is that by securing the sale of the stake to a company Mr Ecclestone favoured, he would remain in charge of Formula 1 and its commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals.

Mr Ecclestone admits paying Gerhard Gribkowsky, who is serving a jail sentence for receiving the payment, but has denied any wrongdoing.

He says it was a 'shake down' as the banker had been threatening to reveal false details of his tax affairs.

Despite
 his age, Ecclestone attends almost every grand prix race and remains 
central to the sport's commercial success. He has always dismissed talk 
of retirement and there is no obvious replacement when he does finally 
quit or is forced out.

Uncertainty
 over Ecclestone's future makes it hard to revisit stalled efforts to 
launch an initial public offering of Formula One after a planned listing
 in Singapore was abandoned because of turbulent markets two years ago.

CVC paid about $830 million for a 47-percent stake in Formula One held by German bank BayernLB from 2002-06.

Prosecutors
 say that Ecclestone bribed Gribkowsky, chief risk officer at BayernLB, 
to ensure that CVC took control of the sport rather than any rival 
bidder.

Gribkowsky,
 who is expected to give evidence in this trial, was jailed for more 
than eight years in Munich in 2012 for tax evasion and corruption in 
relation to the payments.

Ecclestone
 has said he paid Gribkowsky $10 million but says this was designed to 
silence him because the German banker was threatening to make false 
claims about his tax affairs.

Ecclestone denies the payments were linked to the CVC deal.

Peter Noll, the judge who sentenced Gribkowsky, is also presiding over this case.

The case is due to last until September 16, though the court will only sit one or two days a week.

This will allow Ecclestone to continue to run the sport, albeit with help from close colleagues, especially his legal adviser and confidante Sacha Woodward-Hill.

Third wife: Bernie Ecclestone, 82, with his new wife Fabiana Flosi, 35

Slavica Ecclestone topped the Sunday Times' Rich List in the richest divorcees category after her split with Bernie in 2009

The Formula 1 tycoon is worth an estimated £3billion, but he admitted in an interivew last year that his fame and fortune have not bought him joy.

'I
 am not sure what happiness is. What do those feelings mean? I have 
experienced satisfaction when I have planned something and it has come 
off. But happiness? I am not so sure,' he said in a Times2 interview.

The billionaire gave his daughter Tamara, 28, away last year when she married in South of France.

But he told the newspaper that he did not even celebrate her nuptials.

'I didn't go to the celebrations the next day. I went home. I was there for a job and was happy to do that. I didn't want to hang around. The whole thing was a huge affair, too much really. But I didn't pay for it. My ex-wife did.'

In 2009 Bernie and his wife of 23 years Slavica split up.

Slavica, 55, topped the Sunday Times’
 Rich List in the ‘richest divorcees’ category after she was awarded an 
estimated £740million in 2009 in the divorce - it ended on the grounds 
of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’.

In
 2012 Ecclestone remarried Brazilian marketing director Fabiana Flosi, 
35, at Le Lion, his £23million chalet in the exclusive resort of Gstaad.

The wedding was the third trip down the aisle for the octogenarian, who vowed to ‘remain single for the rest of his life.'

In
 the interview Ecclestone touched on the prospect of facing up 10 years 
in prison - he has been charged with bribery by German prosecutors.

'If I get sent to jail I will have to deal with it. But I don't think I will like it very much,' he told the newspaper.

The trial, 
heard on one or two days a week so Ecclestone can carry out his F1 
duties, will continue on May 2.
