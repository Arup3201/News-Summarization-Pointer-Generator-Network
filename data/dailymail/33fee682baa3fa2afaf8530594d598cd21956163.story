If you're diligent about sticking to low calorie foods believing it's a healthy option and wondering why you still can't still those stubborn pounds - then here's some news that's not sweet to swallow.

By consuming fruity muesli and low-fat yoghurt you may think you are following a diet that will make you trim - but in fact you're consuming more sugar than found in a chocolate bar or fizzy drink.

The NHS recommend about 70g of sugar a day for men and 50g for women but many of us our exceeding this. Our high sugar intake contributes to health problems including tooth decay and obesity - with being overweight causing a host of health problems including type-2 diabetes and heart disease.

Not such a healthy breakfast: Fruity muesli and orange juice is high in sugar

The British Dietetic Association say sugar is not 'bad' for us to have in our diet, rather it is bad too have too much of it,

They state: 'Sugar, like starch, is a carbohydrate. There are many different types of, and names for sugar. For example, sucrose or 'table sugar' is added to drinks, baked goods and confectionery. 

'Fructose is naturally found in fruit and honey and lactose is naturally present in milk. Glucose is also the type of sugar that circulates in the blood, often referred to as 'blood sugar' or 'blood glucose', and provides the body with energy.'

Not so sweet side effects: Too much sugar can lead to obesity and tooth decay

They add: 'A moderate amount of sugar
 can be eaten as part of a healthy balanced diet. There are many 
different types of sugar, and it is the amount and how frequently you 
eat sugar that matters. Eating too much of any food (calories) can cause
 weight gain. Check labels for sugar contents, watch your portion sizes 
and try alternatives where possible'

Health coach, Laura Thomas, 27, a 
self-confessed
 former sugar addict, discovered that a large part of the problem is 
people - including dieters - consuming 'hidden' sugars when they believe
 they are eating healthily.

She told MailOnline: 'Lots of 
manufactured 'diet' and 'low fat' products have hidden sugars that 
dieters should be aware of. Low calorie yoghurts, salad dressings and 
'healthy cereal' based products are the most common culprits. Tomato 
based sauces and soups can also be surprisingly high in sugar. Even 
fajita mix packets can pack in more than you’d expect.'

Laura found low fat yoghurts in particular were actually a guilty pleasure in her diet and not a healthy dessert.

For example, while a strawberry yoghurt may contain little or no fat, it's high in sugar due to flavourings, colourings and natural sugars in fruit should it contain fruit pieces.

An Activia Strawberry yoghurt is just 2 per cent fat but has 17g of sugar - a third of a woman's recommended daily sugar intake.

Laura, who now mentors people on how to live sugar-free via her blog happysugarhabits.com, said natural or Greek yoghurt is a healthier alternative.

She said one way people can try and reduce the amount of sugar in their daily diet is by avoiding sweet foods at breakfast.

'Start the morning off with savoury breakfasts instead of sweet to set the right intention for the day,' she said.

Know what you're eating: Check labels for nutritional content and eat fresh where possible

However, for many this will mean ditching the breakfasts we thought were a healthy start to the day.

While muesli and a glass of orange juice may seem good for you, it's actually laden with sugar.

Laura explains: 'Muesli, especially ones that are labelled 'at least 50 per cent' fruit should be avoided. The fruit is of the dried variety and a very concentrated source of sugar that starts you off first thing with enough sugar for the whole day.

'It would be much better to buy a low fruit muesli or make up a zero sugar version (oats, nuts and seeds) and then add some fresh blueberries instead.'

On the subject of orange juice, while it's high in vitamins, it's also high in sugar so Laura recommends getting vitamin C from other food sources.

Step away from the cake! Follow Laura's advice for a sugar-free life

She said: 'The fibre is removed from orange juice so you can glug down lots of sugar very quickly and easily. You can get vitamin C from lots of other sources if you’re eating lots of salad and vegetables.'

If you do have orange juice, Laura recommends freshly squeezed as a better alternative to a glass from a processed carton.

When it comes to snacking on fruit, Laura said this can also be a sugar trap for the unsuspecting dieter due to the fructose content.

She said: 'Fruit needs to be moderated in line with your sugar related goals. I have eaten different amounts of fruit throughout my low sugar journey depending on how I’ve felt at the time and the extent of my cravings.

'Of course, people should be getting their five-a-day (preferably seven), but if you can make more of these vegetables instead of fruit, you’re helping your tastebuds become more sensitive to the sweet taste and will start to appreciate fruit as the only sweet you really need.

'For a period of time I did limit fruit and opted for only low fructose fruits (e.g berries, kiwi fruit) and avoided those that were higher in sugar (bananas, mangos, dates).' 

Laura said she has seen improvements in her sleep, energy and skin - as well as staying slim - thanks to cutting sugar out of her diet.

While she realises it can be difficult for people to go 'cold turkey' just reducing the amount of sugar in your diet - if that means being aware of the hidden sugars to could be consuming - can make a big difference to your health.

A 150g serving of Onken Fat Free Vanilla yoghurt, left, contains 18.1g of sugar, more than a can of Coca Cola that has 15.9g. Instead have Total 0% fat yoghurt with 4g sugar per 100g

Dorset Cereal Luscious Berries and Cherries Muesli, left, per 45g serving with 125ml semi-skimmed milk has 23.4g sugar - more than a Cadbury's Flake that has 17.7g. Instead go for Muesli without dried fruit and add your own fresh fruit

A bottle of Vitamin Water, left has 7.5g sugar, slightly more than a small Starbucks cappuccino with 7g sugar. Instead, stick to mineral or tap water

Part of problem is 'hidden sugars' consumed in 'healthy' products
