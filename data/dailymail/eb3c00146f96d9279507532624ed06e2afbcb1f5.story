A bride and groom arrived home on their wedding night to find seven of their dogs worth £10,000 had been stolen.

Dog breeder Diane Cross discovered all of the doors to her kennels had been broken open after she arrived at her home in Rishton, Lancashire.

Thieves had stolen her four miniature schnauzers, a toy poodle and two dachshunds during the raid.

Greyhound trainer Mrs Cross is now fearing for the safety of the dogs - particularly her two pregnant schnauzers.

Mrs Cross and her husband Ronnie arrived home from their wedding at 11.45pm to find only three of their ten dogs had been left behind.

Mrs Cross, 49, said: 'We came back in the car and Ronnie wanted to get me as close to the back door as possible so I wouldn’t ruin my dress.

'But as he opened the gate and the car lights shone on to the kennels, I could see the doors had all been forced open and three of the dogs were running loose.

'The thieves had taken seven of the dogs out from the kennels, round the back and across the field.'

The bride, who was one of the first in the country to successfully breed the ‘snoodle’ - a cross between a poodle and a miniature schnauzer - had to quickly change out of her wedding dress to catch the remaining three dogs.

She said: 'I had just got married and this wasn’t the way I wanted to spend my wedding night.

'I have been a breeder for 25 years and I have never had any trouble, I’ve certainly never had a dog stolen.

'I worry how they are, as they won’t know who they’re with and they will sense each other’s fear.

'I just hope they are being treated well. I have been having nightmares and I can see the thieves grabbing the dogs in my sleep. I keep trying to rescue them, but I’m not able to.'

The mother-of-one believes the theft was 
planned and the dogs were likely to have been taken by someone who 
knows the family’s routine.

She said: 'It had to be someone who knew we were out.

'We left here at 3pm and were out for the rest of the day, and we were hardly going to come back home as we were getting married.

'They came wanting the dogs. They only wanted to get into the kennels, as the house wasn’t touched.

'I just hope they are being treated well. I have been having nightmares and I can see the thieves grabbing the dogs in my sleep'

'It’s an isolated house and they would have known they wouldn’t be seen.'

The thieves also vandalised a white Transit van and left behind two gloves, one leather and one plastic, inside the kennel.

PC Johanna Maden, from Rishton’s neighbourhood policing team, appealed for information about the incident, which happened between 3pm and 11.45pm on Saturday, September 21.

She said: 'The RSPCA has also been notified and is checking all the pet sales websites.

'It should be noted that two of the female schnauzers are pregnant. The owners of these dogs have been left devastated and we want to do all we can to reunite them with their pets.'

Mrs Cross hopes someone may know where her dogs are, and can help get them back to her before the two female dogs are due to give birth to up to 12 puppies between them.

'How can seven fully-grown dogs just disappear?' she said.

'The two pregnant schnauzers are likely to be showing now and need to get to the vets. I worry that whoever has them will panic when they realise they are expecting puppies.

'One has had puppies before, so she might be alright, but the other one is likely to have difficulties without any help as this is her first litter.

'I’m just praying someone may know where they are.'

Since the break-in, Mrs Cross has given away two of her remaining dogs, leaving her with just one 15-month-old schnauzer, called Gabby.

'I have brought her in the house so she’s not on her own,' Mrs Cross added.

'She’s howling and ever so terrified. You can see that she’s missing the other dogs desperately and probably remembers what happened that night.

'I have never felt so unsafe in my own home. I feel violated.'
