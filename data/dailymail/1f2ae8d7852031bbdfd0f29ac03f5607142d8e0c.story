Hundreds of thousands of hospital patients are being injected with potentially dangerous blood-thinning drugs for no good reason, a leading expert is warning.

They are needlessly being put at risk of strokes, major stomach bleeds and other serious complications, said vascular consultant Dr Ander Cohen. Some are even dying due to the powerful drugs.

He said too many were being given the thinners because guidelines were littered with ‘schoolboy errors’.

His criticisms are all the more potent because he helped push for greater use of the thinners in the first place.

A decade ago, about 25,000 people were dying every year after developing deep vein thromboses (DVTs) while immobile in hospital beds.

These clots usually form in a leg vein before travelling through the body and getting lodged in the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. The condition, known as a pulmonary embolism (PE), is often fatal.

Blood thinners known as heparins can cut the risk of death from PE by two-thirds – if used in the right patients. But Dr Cohen believes the drugs are now being used ‘too broadly’.

He said: ‘For patients who are at risk of developing a fatal clot, that risk [of the drugs] is balanced by the risk that they might die if they don’t get treated. But you cannot justify giving this treatment to low-risk or negligible-risk patients. They are being put at risk of a fatal bleed in their stomach or brain that could easily kill them.’

About two million people are admitted to hospital every year for urgent treatment, with 800,000 rightly being given the thinners, says Dr Cohen.

But he added: ‘About 20 per cent of the remaining 1.2 million – 240,000 people – also get treatment even though there is no evidence they will benefit. The criteria for giving blood thinners are far too broad.’

He said there was ‘no evidence’ that they cut deaths in patients with a range of conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol and asthma.

According to Dr Cohen, who advises the NHS on DVTs and PEs, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which drew up the guidelines, erroneously recommended such patients got heparin.

‘NICE made these schoolboy errors, because people who drew up the guidelines don’t know the subject,’ he said.

Studies show that one in 100 hospital patients given heparin suffer what Dr Cohen called ‘major bleeds’ – such as bleeding in the brain or another major organ to such an extent that they lost two units of blood. Nice said it was looking at the matter urgently.’
