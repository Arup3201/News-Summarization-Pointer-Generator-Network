Things are going Ben Morgan’s way.

As if scoring two tries and claiming the man-of-match award against Australia wasn’t enough, the England No 8 topped things off by being named QBE player of the autumn series — all just days after beating five-time world champion Eric Bristow at darts.

This time last year, things were not going Morgan’s way. Deeply frustrated by Gloucester’s woeful form under ex-coach Nigel Davies, his Premiership form deserted him and he slipped down the international pecking order as a result.

But the past 12 months have seen a remarkable turnaround for the former 20-stone plumber.

‘It’s been a pretty special few weeks,’ Morgan said on Thursday, just minutes after being named QBE player of the series. ‘I definitely wasn’t expecting it. It’s a great accolade to have.

‘Personally I feel worlds apart from last season. I wasn’t in a good place mentally and 100 per cent it was getting me down. I lost all my confidence. I have to be playing and enjoying myself. That’s where my confidence comes from. I didn’t have any of it. It was hard.

‘But having stuck it out and come through it will really help when I face more tough times. We now have a new set-up at Gloucester (with David Humphreys installed as director of rugby) with new players and new coaches, I feel really, really good.

‘I’m enjoying my rugby again and I think that’s been reflected in how I’ve been playing in the last few games. I’ve signed off the autumn happy.’

He is even happier following his remarkable defeat of Bristow in front of a stunned crowd at a darts event staged at Kingsholm last week.

‘Whatever sport I play I want to win,’ Morgan said. ‘I hadn’t played darts for a while. I was nervous on the oche but I backed myself. You don’t go up there to lose! I hit a 140 and then Eric missed check-out on 81. I won with double four!’

Happy, relaxed and enjoying his time at the top of his sport, it could all have been very different for the Bristol-born No 8.

Four years ago when Morgan turned down an invitation from Johnson to play for England Saxons he thought he’d blown his international future.

Barely three years after being made redundant as an apprentice plumber who used to gorge on entire chickens for lunch, Morgan had moved to Wales, turned professional, slimmed down and was attracting attention on both sides of the Bristol Channel.

Days before qualifying for Wales on residency grounds, Morgan received a call from the former World Cup-winning captain turned England head coach. ‘Martin Johnson left a message on my answer phone, I was absolutely awestruck,’ said Morgan, who had secured a £5,000 contract with Welsh minnows Merthyr in 2008 before signing for the Scarlets a year later.

‘But that was the first I’d heard that England were even looking at me. I was carrying a couple of knocks as well and I didn’t want to go up there and not be 100 per cent. I was a young lad, panicking that if I didn’t impress I’d regret it for ever.

‘I was so nervous making that call. Saying no to Martin Johnson? Who wouldn’t be? I was absolutely dreading it.

‘He was really good about it but it was a huge call and I was worried that I’d blown my whole future.’

Now with 27 caps to his name, the 25-year-old is starting to look the part at Test level. Barring injury or an unexpected loss of form, he looks sure to start England’s opening Six Nations clash against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 ahead of Billy Vunipola.

But it took an intervention from Stuart Lancaster after Johnson’s departure in 2011 to convince Morgan he should throw his lot in with England.

‘I’d always wanted to play for England, I’d never considered playing for another country growing up,’ he said. ‘Just talking with Stuart about how he saw things gave me confidence I was being watched. It was a reassuring meeting.’

Firmly established in Lancaster’s squad, the work Morgan has done in order to lose around 18 kilograms is paying dividends.

‘When I first started at Scarlets I weighed 132.5 kilos. I was a big lad. The first year was just about trying to get me in shape.

‘When I worked on the building site we would go for a greasy fry up every Friday. I’d go for lunch and buy a French stick, split it open and stick a chicken in it

‘A whole chicken. I think about it now and think what the hell was I doing? I know so much more about my body now and how to take care of myself.’

With a World Cup pending, England’s fans will hope things continue to go Morgan’s way.
