A five-year-old girl has died in hospital three days after developing a strain of the flu that she was vaccinated against - as a deadly outbreak of the virus continues to sweep across the country.

Keira Driscoll was prescribed steroids and a nebulizer at a Quick Care clinic after she started feeling unwell with a cough and a fever at her home in Clark County, Las Vegas, last Sunday.

But just hours later, she collapsed. Her mother, Tiffany Driscoll, frantically performed CPR on her small body, before she was rushed to hospital. There, she was found to have influenza A.

Despite medics' best efforts, Keira could not be resuscitated and she was placed on life support. On Tuesday, her parents made the heartbreaking decision to turn off the machine the next day.

However, Keira died before the machine would have been switched off after suffering from a cardiac arrest. She was surrounded by her mother, father, Peter Driscoll, and other relatives at the time.

The youngster is the fourth child in the Nevada-based county - and the 56th nationwide - to have died from the flu in the past few months as vaccines have proved largely ineffective.

Speaking to Fox 5 News, Keira's aunt, Laura Beckstead, who is headmistress at the school Keira attended, paid tribute to 'a happy girl' who was 'always curious and loved learning'.

'She was the first one to come up and give somebody a hug. She liked everyone,' said Ms Beckstead, who runs the private American Heritage Academy in South Sandhill Road.

Too young: On Tuesday, the Driscolls made the difficult decision to turn off Keira's life support machine the next day. However, Keira died from a cardiac arrest before this. Above, the Driscolls hold their child's hand

Sad: On Fundly.com, Keira's family announced their young relative's death, asking donors to pray for them

She added that the family is relying on their faith, saying: 'Even though Kiera has been taken from us, we believe that her time here, her mission was fulfilled and that she is in a better place.'

On Thursday, Keira's classmates dressed in her favorite colour - purple - to pay tribute to the youngster, who also loved 'rainbows, ponies, kittens, princesses, unicorns and everything magical'.

Keira's death comes amid a national flu outbreak.

So far this season, 56 children have died from flu across the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the first week of the year alone, 19 children died

Spread: This map shows the high activity level of flu that has swept the U.S. during the 2014/2015 season

In total, more than 8,000 people have been hopitalized with the flu since the start of October, with the elderly the most affected, the CDC reported. 

The central states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Texas, have reported the highest incidence of flu illnesses. Most of the victims have suffered from one of two influenza A strains. 

This is despite, so far this season, a higher number of people having had the flu vaccine than last (40.3 per cent were vaccinated early this season, compared to 39.5 per cent early last season).

Keira's death also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three quarters of people who had the injection - which contains strains of influenza A - this year will get the virus anyway.

Uptake: So far this season, more people have had flu injections than last season, this CDC graph shows

The percentage of effective injections - 23 per cent - is one of the worst performances since the government started tracking how well vaccines work in the 2004-2005 season. 

The effectiveness has ranged from 10 to 60 per cent, the CDC said. 

According to the Southern Nevada Health District, there have been six flu-related deaths in Clark County this season. Four of the six were children. Last season, 109 children nationally died from flu.

Keira is also survived by her 19-month-old sister, River Driscoll. Her family, which is Irish, celebrated her life with a wake at Sweet Tomatoes - her favorite restaurant - on Friday, News 3 reported. 

They have also set up a Fundly.com account to help pay for the youngster's funeral expenses. 

Another victim: Earlier this month, 15-year-old Kobi Pickett (pictured) died at home in Houston, Texas, after passing out in the shower and crashing through the glass door while suffering from a strain of the flu

To date, 56 children have died from the flu this season - and more than 8,000 across the country have been hospitalized with the virus since October 1, the CDC has said.

At the end of the year, the CDC confirmed for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 per cent of all deaths.

And now, in the midst of a worrisome flu season, health officials are pushing doctors to prescribe antiviral medicines more often.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lat week sent a new alert to doctors, advising prompt use of Tamiflu and other antivirals for hospitalized flu patients and those at higher risk for complications like pneumonia.

CDC officials say a nasty strain of flu is going around that is more dangerous to elderly people and young children.  Worryingly, officials think vaccines do not work well against this particular virus.

So 'it's more important than usual' that doctors treat certain patients with Tamiflu or other antiviral medications,' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at a press conference..

CDC research suggests doctors prescribe antivirals to one in five high-risk flu patients. However, the centers' officials say the number should be higher.

When given promptly - within two days of the beginning of flu symptoms - the antivirals can shorten the amount of time someone is sick with the flu, a number of studies have found.

The drugs also can prevent patients from becoming sick enough to end up in a hospital intensive care unit - or worse, Frieden said. 'Antiviral flu medicines save lives,' Dr Frieden said.

The CDC sent an advisory to physicians last month, warning them this could be a potentially bad flu season and encouraging prompt treatment with antivirals.

Officials said doctors should not wait for test results confirming the flu if they are dealing with an elderly patient, someone who is very sick, or someone with pre-existing medical conditions.
