Another Star Wars movie is to be made in Britain in the latest sign that the force is with the burgeoning film industry.

Chancellor George Osborne tonight announced that filming of the latest film - a keenly anticipated spin-off - will begin next year.

The recently announced stand-alone Star Wars film will be directed by Gareth Edwards, with filming to take place at Pinewood Studios.

The Chancellor sealed the deal with Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, on the set of Star Wars: Episode VII, where they met with Lucasfilm President, Kathleen Kennedy and that film’s director, J.J. Abrams.

New reliefs have helped attract billions of pounds worth of filmmaking to Britain over the past few years. In the last year alone, over 300 films received tax incentives from the Government.

They include films such as Skyfall, Burke & Hare, Hugo, Inception, War Horse, The Iron Lady, The Woman in Black and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

The Government has offered similar reliefs for quality TV productions.

The Star Wars franchise was given a dramatic new release of life last year when creator George Lucas sold the rights to Disney in a $4.05billion deal to buy Lucasfilm.

Multiple global locations were used between 1976 and 2003 for the production of the first six Star Wars films to provide the setting for alien planets,

Some of the early movies were shot at Ealing and Elstree Studios. The costumes of the stormtroopers, Darth Vader, and C-3PO were made by British craftspeople.

The Chancellor said: 'Lucasfilm and Disney’s decision to shoot the Star Wars standalone movie in the UK is testament to the incredible talent in Britain.

'This will mean more jobs and more investment. It is great news for people working at Pinewood Studios, from the set designers to the carpenters.

'As Chancellor I have been determined that we back our brilliant creative industries which is why we have invested in skills and training as well as providing tax relief for films, high-end TV, animation, video games and regional theatre.

'The further changes the government made to the film tax relief at Budget 2014 will support our highly skilled, innovative creative sectors so that they continue to thrive and encourage more films to be made in the UK.'

Kathleen Kennedy said: 'The UK crew that we’re working with on Star Wars: Episode VII is incredible. They’re among the most gifted and passionate when it comes to film and storytelling.

'Star Wars couldn’t be in better hands.'

Mr Javid said: 'This is great news for the UK and is further proof of the world-leading position of the UK film industry.

'We have studios, tax incentives and talent, both in front of and behind the camera, which are amongst the very best in the world. Given Lucasfilm’s decision to film another Star Wars movie in the UK, it is clear that the Force is strong here.'

By choosing the UK, films can benefit from the UK’s film tax relief, which gives 25 percent tax relief on the first £20million of qualifying expenditure, and 20 percent thereafter.

Investment in UK-based film production in 2013 was over £1billion – an increase of 14 percent on the previous year.

Film tax relief also helped to attract international filmmakers to the UK, with inward investment reaching over £868 million for 2013.
