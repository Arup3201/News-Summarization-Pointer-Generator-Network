The US birth rate fell to an all-time low in 2013, continuing a downward trend that started six years earlier.

According to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American women gave birth to 3,932,181million babies last year, down one percent from 2012 and nine percent from 2007 when birth rates hit a record high.

Women ages 15-44 delivered the lowest number of babies last year at a rate of 62.5 births per 1,000.

By comparison, 4.32million children were welcomed into the world in the US seven years ago.  

The government has been tracking US birth rates since 1909, when there were 126.8 births per 1,000 women.

As birth rates among women in their 20s continued to decline, for women ages 35 and older 2013 was a banner year marked by the highest number of deliveries in a half century.

In 2013, the birth rate for women ages 35-39 reached 49.3 births per 1,000, and 98 births for women ages 30–34.

As medical researchers continued to make strides in fertility treatments and gynecology, women in their late 40s have seen an increase in birth rates from 0.7 to 0.8 per 1,000 - a 14 per cent increase from 2012.  

The birth rate among teenagers plummeted 10 per cent from 2012, hitting 26.5 births per 1,000, and rates also dropped by 3 per cent for women ages 20-24.

The lower birth rates among women under the age of 30 and higher birth rates among women in their 40s could be attributed to the fact 20-somethings are delaying pregnancy to focus on their careers.

William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, told the New York Times the fertility rates are tied to the country's economic climate. 

'On just about every demographic indicator involving young adults, whether it’s marriage, buying a home or delaying childbearing, it’s all been on hold since the beginning of the recession,' he said. 'I think it’ll come back up, and each time new numbers are coming out, I think maybe this will be the moment.' 

The year 2013 was also marked by a slight increase in the number of twins born in the US and a 1 per cent decline in the number of premature babies.

The Cesarean delivery rate also slid 1 percent from 2012, to 32.7 per cent. C-section births hit an all-time high in 2009 but have been on the decline for the past four years.

General fertility rates were down one per cent for African-Americans and 2 per cent for Hispanic women, but inched up for white women.
