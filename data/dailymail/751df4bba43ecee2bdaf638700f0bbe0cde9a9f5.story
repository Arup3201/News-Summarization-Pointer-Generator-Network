Reading have signed former Fulham, Aston Villa and Bolton defender Zat Knight on a free transfer until the end of the season.

Knight, who has two England caps, started his career at Fulham before making a £3.5million move to Villa in August 2007. He had been training at Watford in recent weeks but they opted not to make him a contract offer.

However, Steve Clarke decided to give him a chance. Reading have 10 games left in the Championship as well as an FA Cup quarter-final replay.

'With the team currently in the middle of a really hectic schedule, I felt it was prudent to bring another experienced defender to help share the load,' Royals manager Steve Clarke told the club website.

'When I heard that Zat was back in the UK and looking for a club, I felt he would be a perfect fit.'

The 34-year-old joined Bolton for £4m in July 2009 but left at the end of last season and had a brief spell with Colorado Rapids in Major League Soccer.
