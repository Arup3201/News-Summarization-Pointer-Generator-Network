Victim: Lexie Kamerman, a 27-year-old university student development specialist, was one of three Americans killed in a deadly suicide attack in Kabul which claimed 21 lives on Friday

Heartbreaking: The family of Lexie Kamerman, 27, described her as 'smart, strong, beautiful, funny, stubborn and kind'

'She took the job at the American 
University of Afghanistan to help the young women of Afghanistan get an 
education and take their rightful place as leaders in Afghan society,' 
the family's statement said.

Kamerman completed a Masters in higher education at the University of Arizona in 2012 and was a keen water polo player. 

One of Kamerman's university colleagues was also killed in the blast, along with a U.S. victim identified by the United Nations as a Somali-American.

Afghan police said 13 foreigners and eight Afghans died when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the Lebanese restaurant, which is popular with tourists, while two gunmen entered through the back door and opened fire.

Two Canadians, one from Quebec and the other from Ontario, were also killed.

The Samson and Associates employees were in the Afghan capital doing auditing work for the Canadian International Development Agency.

'This is the first time that we've ever had such a thing,' company chief Pierre Samson said, explaining that his firm has done work in Afghanistan for some time.

'As auditors we're not on the front so we don't usually go where it is very dangerous, but in a case like this the attack was directly in town, so it was not in a danger area. But unfortunately we were there at a bad time.'

Samson said he was given the news Friday evening by the Canadian embassy in Kabul.

He didn't identify the men because his firm is still trying to get in touch with family members.

Others identified were two Britons - development specialist Dharmender Singh Phangura, also known as Del Singh, and close protection officer Simon Chase - two Lebanese, a Danish police officer, a Russian, a Malaysian and a Pakistani.

Phangura, who along with the Malaysian worked as an adviser for Adam Smith International, was to run as a Labour Party candidate in upcoming elections for the European Parliament.

Also among the dead were the International Monetary Fund's Lebanese representative, Wabel Abdallah, and Vadim Nazarov, a Russian who was the chief political affairs officer at the U.N. Mission in Afghanistan.

Nazarov was one of the U.N's most experienced officials, fluent in the country's languages and with experience dating back to the 1980s. He was one of three U.N. victims.

Operation: Afghan security forces arrive at the scene of the explosion in the capital, Kabul

The attack comes as security has been deteriorating and apprehension has been growing among Afghans over their country's future as U.S.-led foreign forces prepare for a final withdrawal at the end of the year.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who is deferring signing an agreement allowing U.S. forces to stay past the planned withdraw until after the country's April 5 presidential election, criticized America while condemning the attack.

'If NATO forces and in the lead the United States of America want to cooperate and be united with Afghan people, they must target terrorism,' he said without fully elaborating on what America should be doing.

He added that America had followed a policy that 'was not successful in the past decade'.

Police: Armed officers surround the scene after the bombing. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack an hour later

Meanwhile, the attack was condemned by the U.N. Security Council, NATO, the White House and the European Union.

'There is no possible justification for this attack, which has killed innocent civilians, including Americans, working every day to help the Afghan people achieve a better future with higher education and economic assistance,' the White House said in a statement on Saturday.

Insurgents have frequently targeted foreign interests around the country and in Kabul.

However Friday's horrific blast has been described as 
the deadliest single attack against foreign civilians in the course of a
 nearly 13-year U.S.-led war.

Treatment: Kebab cook Abdul Majid is stretchered into the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital following the deadly attacked

Survived: The cook witnesses the attacked and was left with broken bones as he fled the scene

The
 Taliban claimed responsibility within an hour of the attack, which was 
said to be part of a stepped-up campaign of violence against foreign and
 government interests.

It
 is believed the extremists are trying to send a message that they are 
not going anywhere as the involvement of foreign troops winds down this 
year.

The attack was carried out at a time when the restaurant would have been busy with diners.

The suicide attacker detonated his explosives outside the gate of the heavily-fortified restaurant, the country’s Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said.

Then two gunmen entered the restaurant and started shooting at survivors inside.

The attackers were eventually shot dead by security forces when they arrived at the scene.

The area is home to a number of foreign embassies and organizations.

Jan Kubis, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, said: 'I strongly condemn condemn the targeting of civilians in any form, and, in particular, the continued use of suicide bombers.

'This violence is unacceptable and must stop immediately.'
