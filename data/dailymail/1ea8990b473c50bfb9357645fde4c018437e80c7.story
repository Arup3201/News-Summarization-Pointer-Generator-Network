Good genes reigned at the opening of Morwenna Lytton Cobbold's Models and Mothers exhibition on Monday night.

The event, which was held at London's The Gilbert Scott restaurant in support of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, was hosted by Burberry model Morwenna.

The redhead has shot a series of photographs of some of Britain's hottest young models and their equally gorgeous mothers for her exhibition, Models & Mothers.

Former Made In Chelsea starlet Amber Atherton attended with her mother Jane, whilst blonde haired Portia Freeman, who has starred in Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton campaigns, was joined by mother Liz.

Guests drank Meadow Sweet cocktails and nibbled roasted pumpkin and sage tartlets as the 'at home' portraits were unveiled.

Mowenna's boyfriend Phil Bush played the role of auctioneer as a lively crowd placed bids on a night at the St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel and dinner at The Gilbert Scott.

Speaking about the event, Mowenna told MyDaily: 'It started as part of my final coursework for London College of Fashion and then the opportunity to work with Breakthrough Breast Cancer came up.

'I'm so pleased to be able to help to support the charity.'

Another guest and model (of course), Greta Bellamacina said: 'I didn't realise how brilliant she is!

'That's part of what I've loved about this. She made us feel so at ease and the pictures are very personal, it's a lovely thing to be part of.'

Mum and me: Claire Selby and her mother also attended the display, which had an auction to raise money for Breast Cancer UK

The whole concept initially began as a private project. Speaking to Vogue.co.uk, Mowenna said: 'I travelled to their homes, removing the sitters from the conventional big fashion shoot set up.

'Having worked and travelled around the world as a model myself since I was 16 years old, the importance of time at home with family has become increasingly apparent.'

Shot on medium-format film with a Mamiya RZ Pro II camera, the exhibition aims to capture models in their natural habitat on the rare occasions they relax at home with their families.

Personal: The whole concept initially began as a private project, where Mowenna visited the homes of models such as Portia Freeman (R)

She may be a serious model but Mowenna revealed she has always had a passion for photography.

She said: 'My mum gave me her Eighties Nikon FE2 camera, which I learnt all the basics on.

'It began my love of shooting film, and I built a darkroom in our old bike shed at home.'

As well as being displayed last night, her photographs are to be published in a book, Mother, which will raise money for Breakthrough Breast Cancer.
