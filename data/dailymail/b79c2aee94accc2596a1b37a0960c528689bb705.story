Not satisfied with regularly being voted The World’s Sexiest Woman by readers of various men’s magazines, Kelly Brook is taking her looks to a new level with a range of beauty supplements developed by celebrity make-up artist Gary Cockerill.

Kelly’s close friend Gary, whose clients also include Melinda Messenger, Martine McCutcheon and Melanie Sykes, has collaborated with NRG Fuel to develop the vitamin boosters, designed to promote beauty from within.

Beauty Within consists of Green Caffeine, Raspberry Ketones, Colon Cleanser and Acai Berry vitamin pills.

The lead product is a fruit punch flavour vitamin powder. 

Gary has sent boxes of the beauty drink, which contains vitamins to help the body produce collagen, to celebrity pals in the hope it will improve their hair, skin and nails. 

He says: ‘What we put into our bodies shows on the outside.’

Kelly, 34, who recently split from boyfriend David McIntosh, has been exercising hard in Los Angeles, mixing cardio and weight-training in the gym with hiking in Runyon Canyon.

Clever way to take tablets 

Help is at hand for those who forget to take their medication, sometimes with serious consequences.

A new device, Clever Card, will help patients keep on top of their tablet-taking. Clever Card works by detecting when a blister pack is opened and sending a message to a cloud-based data system. The system will set off an alarm or a flashing light on a mobile phone-like device to remind the patient to take their next pill.

The system, which is at trial stage, can also be monitored by pharmacists or carers, who can check on the patient if they see that a dose is missed. Wasted prescriptions cost the NHS £500 million every year, and 200,000 deaths occur annually in the EU because of missed doses.

Casting new light on the classroom fidgets  

They're the bane of many teachers’ lives, but now there may be a simple way to stop fidgeting schoolchildren – by changing a light bulb. The warmth and strength of lighting can have a major effect on fidgeting, according to a new research. Light is known to have effects on mood and behaviour, and a Hamburg University study looked at the effects of different types of light on school pupils’ behaviour.

A big decline in fidgeting was noted when using a dark, warm white light with reduced brightness. The same light also improved behaviour, with fewer classroom assaults on other pupils.

However, it is not known how this works. One theory is that it has an impact on mood and movement through the manipulation of the body clock, or it may be that dark, warm light evokes relaxation and a sense of reassurance.

In a study of 1,736 participants, the use of acupuncture, carried out over more than four weeks in 893 patients, showed reduction in pain, improved mobility and better quality of life compared to no treatment or usual care

Acupuncture can significantly reduce the intensity of pain felt by osteoarthritis patients, according to new research. 

In a study of 1,736 participants, the use of acupuncture, carried out over more than four weeks in 893 patients, showed reduction in pain, improved mobility and better quality of life compared to no treatment or usual care. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition suffered by a third of those aged over 45. 

Gradual loss of joint cartilage results in pain and loss of mobility. The results of the study were published in the BMC Complementary And Alternative Medicine journal. 

Ellie and her pet gecko Eddie, right, are the stars of a new children’s book aimed at helping parents manage their youngsters’ dry and eczema-prone skin. Called The Dry-Ventures Of Ellie And Eddie, their story Bye Bye Dry Skin comes from dry-skin cream brand Aveeno and can be downloaded free from aveeno.co.uk. 

About one child in five in the UK suffers from dry or eczema-prone skin, which doesn’t produce as many fats and oils as normal skin, making it less able to retain water. 

The lack of moisture causes gaps to open up between skin cells – and as moisture is lost from the deeper layers, skin becomes dry and irritated. It can affect sleep and day-to-day life.
