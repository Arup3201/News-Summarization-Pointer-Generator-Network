A lawyer for Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin revealed further shocking details on Thursday about the bullying he suffered at the hands of teammates. 

Martin walked out on the Dolphins last 
week after reportedly suffering a catalog of abuse, including a racist 
voice mail message from fellow player Richie Incognito, who has been 
suspended.

Lawyer David Cornwell said in a statement that along with Incognito calling Martin a "half-n*****' in a voicemail, another unidentified player threatened to rape Martin's sister.

Part of the violent and vulgar threat, directed at Martin's sister, included the words: 'She loves me. I am going to f*** her without a condom.'

Martin's lawyer did not specify to ESPN whether the words were said to Martin or if it was a voice-mail or text. He also claimed that the player had suffered a 'malicious physical attack'.

The statement continues: 'Jonathan endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing. For the entire season-and-a-half that he was with the Dolphins, he attempted to befriend the same teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment.

'This is a textbook reaction of victims of bullying. Despite these efforts, the taunting continued. Beyond the well-publicized voice mail with its racial epithet, Jonathan endured a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate, and daily vulgar comments such as the quote at the bottom. These facts are not in dispute.'

Mr Cornwell said that his client looks forward to returning to football and intends to cooperate with the NFL investigation.

The NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith said on Thursday that he had been in touch with Dolphins' players and said that every player deserves safe and professional working conditions.

Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Jonathan Martin

After leaving the team last week, 
Martin briefly checked himself into a South Florida hospital to be 
treated for emotional distress.

The
Dolphins's management arranged for his parents to travel to South 
Florida from their home in California where he is now staying.

His father Gus told omg! Insider: 'He's a strong man. He's doing fine.'

According to one source, who did not wish to be named, Martin
had considered giving up the sport because he was mistreated by other 
offensive linemen.

The source added Martin, who sought counseling for emotional issues, now plans to continue playing.

Incognito
was reportedly told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin when he subjected
his teammate to abusive voice mail and texts messages.

It
has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team 
activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the 
offensive line's undisputed leader, to 'get [Martin] into the fold'.

Just
days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive voicemail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ 
threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words 
‘I'll kill you.’

Last week,
Martin's agent said the second-year player from Stanford was harassed 
almost daily by teammates in his rookie year and the hazing continued 
into this season.

That 
prompted an NFL investigation, and the Dolphins suspended Incognito, who
sources said sent Martin threatening and racist messages during the 
off-season.

Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed a New York lawyer with experience in sports cases to investigate the case.

Dolphins'
players have rallied passionately defended Incognito and insisting they
didn't see the blowup coming. Most said Martin and Incognito were 
friends.

'I don't know why 
he's doing this,' offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said. 'And the only 
person who knows why, his name is Jonathan Martin.'

Guard John Jerry said he never heard Incognito use the racist term included in one voicemail and wouldn't have objected anyway.

'I
would have just laughed it off,' Jerry said. 'I know the type of person
he is, and I know he doesn't mean it that way. Everybody's got friends 
that when you're out, they say those type of things. It's never made a 
big deal.'

Was Incognito under orders? It isn't clear whether the instructions to 'toughen up' Martin came from head coach Joe Philbin, pictured, or another coach

The 30-year-old 
Incognito was kicked off his team at Nebraska, and has long had a 
reputation as one of the NFL's dirtiest players. But he has been 
universally praised by his teammates this week.

'Does he like to give guys a hard time? Yes. Does he like to pester guys and have fun? Yes,' Tannehill said.

'But
he brought a lot of laughter to this locker room, he brought a lot of 
cohesiveness to this locker room and he was the best teammate that I 
could ask for.'

For Martin,
the final straw was a lunchroom prank at the team complex, and he then 
left the squad. Tannehill and Jerry said the same prank has been pulled 
on many other players.

Hijinks are especially common among the offensive linemen, Clabo said.

'We
have a system of basically it's just a big joke, basically,' he said. 
'It helps camaraderie. It keeps things light in the room. Everyone 
participates. No one is exempt and so I don't see how ... we would all 
be guilty of bullying.'

The 24-year-old Martin was briefly hospitalized after he left the team and is now with his family in California.

Tannehill said he was shocked when Martin departed.

He
added: 'The whole thing, it's kind of mind-blowing to me. It's kind of 
mind-blowing to most of the guys on our team right now.

'It's tough for me, because you can't help a situation that you didn't know existed - that no one on this team knew existed.

'We
have a bunch of good guys in this locker room. To be put in a situation
where everyone's attacking the locker room saying it's such a bad 
place, such a bad culture, no leadership to stand up and stop the 
situation - no one knew there was a situation to be stopped.'
