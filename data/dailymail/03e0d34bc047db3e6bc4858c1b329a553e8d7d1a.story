A Texas boy, 12, suffering from a rare incurable disease cannot get access to new research that could potentially save him because of the government shutdown.

Justin Clark from Bellaire was diagnosed with a recessive disorder called Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) two months ago.

Children who have it rarely grow up, according to Justin’s mother, Lagenia.

‘Some of them can never walk,’ she told KHOU 11 News.

Fatal: Justin Clark, 13, from Texas, was diagnosed with a rare recessive disorder which is currently incurable. A new clinical trial might change everything

Disease symptoms: The legs weaken first, sight and hearing can go next, and patients are ultimately bedridden

Though her son’s symptoms surfaced unusually late in life, the path from here may be inevitable. 

The legs weaken first, sight and hearing can go next, and patients are ultimately bedridden.

Justin is currently still wearing a brace from the second of two surgeries he had on his feet which each lasted four hours.

The family has been working with a non-profit called Hannah’s Hope Fund to fund research.

This month, researchers were supposed to present their finds to the National Institutes of Health to have them sign off on a clinical trial, which would have been available for Justin and could have saved his life.

However, because of the government shutdown, it has been put on hold indefinitely until the government starts up again.

‘Every day could be a day that a child could be dying if we don’t get this clinical trial started,’ said Mrs Clark.

Lagenia Clark and David Clark, Justin's parents, say every day the government is shutdown is a day 'a child could be dying'

Braces: Justin has had two surgeries in two months on his feet and is still wearing a brace on his leg

The family is now focused on fundraising and Justin’s twin brother will soon be competing in a half-ironman to raise money for research.

Justin is trying to keep up spirits and describes his battle with the disease ‘as a challenging video game’.

Another person with a fatal illness who is being gravely affected by the shutdown is Michelle Langbehn from Auburn, California.

Last year, just weeks after giving birth to daughter Lula, the 30-year-old was diagnosed with sarcoma, a rare form of cancer.

She was told by a specialist that people with the diagnosis live up to a year, on average.

Devastating news: Michelle Langbehn, 30, with her daughter Lula, 13 months. The new mother was told last year that she had one year to live

Sad: Langbehn said the thought of not being able to be there for her daughter and husband was 'absolutely heartbreaking'

‘The thought of not possibly being able to be here for my daughter and my husband was absolutely heartbreaking,’ she told NBC Bay Area.

Langbehn has since endured five surgeries, undergone radiation and different rounds of chemotherapy.

Running out of time and options, she signed up with the National Institutes of Health for a promising new drug.

She was expecting approval this week, but now must wait for the government shutdown to end.

'Each month counts': She says she already has 'a new spot' that has popped up

‘When you are given a terminal diagnosis, each month counts,’ she said. ‘And I already have one new spot that has popped up.’

Every second the shutdown drags on, is impacting not just livelihoods, but lives, she and her husband said.

‘I'd love to think about the future with my daughter, but right now it's unknown,’ she said. ‘I'd love to think about her first day of kindergarten. Or her getting married but I don't know if that's possible.’
