Hundreds of Maoist rebels attacked a convoy of leading Indian politicians, killing 24 people on Saturday.

Militants ambushed members of the Congress Party as they returned from a campaign event in Chhattisgarh, central India, planting landmines and shooting party leaders and supporters.

Four state party leaders and eight police officers were among the victims of the attack, which also saw 37 people injured.

Today, Indian officials reacted with outrage at the attack, which was carried out in Chhattisgarh’s tribal community as an apparent warning to officials to stay away from the Maoist rebel stronghold.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party President Sonia Gandhi visited some of the injured in a hospital Sunday in the Chhattisgarh state capital Raipur, promising the government would take firm action against the perpetrators.

‘We are devastated,’ said Gandhi, who denounced the ‘dastardly attack’ as a on the country's democratic values.

Rajnath Singh, president of the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said the country should unite in its fight against the Maoist insurgency, known as Naxalites.

The convoy was attacked in a densely forested area about 215 miles south of Raipur as the Congress members were returning from a party rally.

Uprising: According to police officers, 11 of the 37 injured are still in a critical condition following the ambush in a forest in the central Indian state

Damage done: A man in blood-covered trousers is treated for his injuries in the attack which saw about 200 suspected Maoist rebels set off a land mine and open fire on the convoy

About 200 attackers blocked the road 
by felling trees, forcing the convoy to halt. Police officer R.K. Vij 
said the suspected rebels triggered a land mine that blew up one of the 
cars.

The attackers then fired at the Congress party leaders and their 
supporters before fleeing.

Congress
is the main opposition party in the state. It has stepped up political 
activities, trying to win the support of tribals, ahead of state 
elections scheduled to be held by December.

Police officer Vij said 11 of the 37 injured were in serious condition.

Police
identified one of those dead as Mahendra Karma, a Congress party leader
in Chhattisgarh who founded a local militia to combat the Maoist 
rebels.

The anti-rebel militia had to be reined in after it was accused 
of atrocities against people of lower castes, known as ‘tribals’.

Destruction: A man stands next to a crater caused by a land mine blast in the rebel attack on Saturday

Fatal: Indian security personnel carry the body of one of the victims of Saturday's rebel ambush in Bastar, 215 miles south of Raipur in Chhattisgarh state

The dead also included state Congress party chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son.

K.P.S.
Gill, a former police chief of Punjab state who has written widely on 
reform, said the attack was ‘a very horrifying incident.’

However, Gill said the state government was incapable of devising a strategy to tackle the Maoist threat.

‘They don't have the political will and bureaucratic and police set-up to prevent such attacks,’ he said.

He said the state government had ignored the need for special forces to tackle the threat.

‘Most of the special forces in the state are being used for non-operational duties like guarding state politicians,’ he said.

Prime Minister Singh has called the rebels India's biggest internal security threat. They are now present in 20 of India's 28 states and have thousands of fighters, according to the Home Ministry.

The Naxalites  have been fighting the central government for more than four decades, demanding land and jobs for tenant farmers and the poor.

They take their name from the West Bengal village of Naxalbari where the movement began in 1967.

The fighters were inspired by Chinese Communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and have drawn support from displaced tribal populations opposed to corporate exploitation and official corruption.

The government has offered to begin peace talks with the rebels, but without success. The Maoists demand that it first withdraw thousands of paramilitary soldiers deployed to fight the rebels.

Maoist rebels carried out two major attacks in Chhattisgarh in 2010. They ambushed a paramilitary patrol in April that year, killing 76 troops in their worst attack ever. A month later, they triggered a land mine under a bus carrying civilians and police, killing 31 people.
