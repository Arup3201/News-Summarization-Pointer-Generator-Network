Demolition work on the house where a couple killed their six young children after they set it alight is beginning today.

The semi-detached house at 18 Victory Road, Derby, will be razed to the ground this week, nearly two and a half years after Mick and Mairead Philpott's children died in the fire.

Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers 
John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, died in the blaze
in May 2012. Duwayne, 13, died days later in hospital.

Mick and Mairead Philpott were jailed in
April, along with friend Paul Mosley, after being convicted of killing 
the couple's six children in the petrol-fuelled blaze in the suburb of Allenton.

Today Mrs Philpott's mother Vera Duffy stood outside the house where builders were erecting scaffolding before demolition work begins on the house and the one next to it.

Mrs Duffy, 55, said: 'I'm just here to see it.  The children will be resting in peace now.'

The three-bedroom house, which has been boarded up since firefighters put out the flames of the deadly fire in May 2011, still has withered floral tributes to the children who died pinned to the front door.

Mick Philpott was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years after being convicted of six counts of manslaughter following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court earlier this year.

The trial heard that Philpott used petrol to set fire to his home in a bid to frame his mistress during a child custody battle.

Kind: The companies involved in the demolition have pledged to give their fees to a children's charity

His wife Mairead and Mosley were told they would each serve half of a 17-year sentence for their part in the plan to set fire to the property.

Derby City Council said the process 
of demolition is likely to take up to three weeks; one week to prepare 
the site and a further two weeks to take down both properties, beginning
with the outbuildings and roofing structures.

New social housing is expected to be built on the site in due course.

The
firms involved in the demolition have agreed to donate their fee to 
Derbyshire Children's Holiday Centre in Skegness, which provides 
disadvantaged local children with holidays in the town.

Local councillor Baggy Shanker said: 'I think we all welcome the demolition of these properties.

'Whilst the tragic deaths of the six Philpott children will never be forgotten, local people continue to move on and this is symbolic of the end of a very difficult time for the community.'

The deadly blaze in May 2012 was started by Philpott with the help of wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley while their six children were sleeping upstairs.

They had hatched an elaborate plot in which Mick would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner Lisa Willis, with whom Philpott was locked in a legal battle for custody of the four children they had together.

But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong.

Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F.

They should not build more houses, they should put something community based there to help children and a memorial. They can build two new houses elsewhere.

I think it´s incredibly tacky  that whoever is demolishing it has put a massive advertising banner on the front.

They are going to demolish both semi detached houses (ie the Philpot's and the on joined to it)? Or are they going to demolish just the Philpot's house alone and make good the exposed party wall with render and the roof of the other house. I think it's right to demolish the Philpot's house but I don't think their neighbours should have to lose their home [whether they are council tennants themselves or indeed own the place] because of the evil deeds of these children's parents. If the adjacent attached house were my dwelling, I'd be mighty miffed to have to suffering having it demolished through having had the misfortune of having lived next door to a monsper and his warped spouse.

The other half of the semi was empty as the owner had died, the council bought the house back. Both are being demolished and two new houses being built on the site as that is what the residents wanted. They didn't want a memorial garden because let's face it does anyone want the parents going there when they get out of prison? New housing is far better.

Why destroy a perfectly good home - why not just restyle it, reshape the front or build an extension so that it looks visibly different.
