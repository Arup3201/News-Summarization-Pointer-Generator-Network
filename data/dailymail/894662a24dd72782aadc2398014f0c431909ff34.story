Maintaining a yoga pose on dry land is considered a tricky process by many people.

But one mother has taken the sport to a new extreme by practising her yoga poses out on the open water on a stand-up paddle board, with her three kids in tow.

The new craze, which is already huge in America, is slowly but surely catching on in Australia and Sharee Sanderson and her kids are at the forefront of the trend.

The new craze, which is already huge in America, is slowly but surely catching on in Australia and Ms Sanderson and her kids are at the forefront of the trend

34-year-old  Sanderson became the first person in Australia to be certified as an accredited stand-up paddle board yoga instructor last year and her active children are set to follow in her footsteps.

Since then, there has been no stopping the mum, who runs packed classes of stand-up paddle yoga in Currumbin and brings her enthusiastic children along for the ride. 

'They see me doing it so they don’t really have a choice, I've kind of brain washed them', Ms Sanderson jokingly told Daily Mail Australia.

The Ballarat born woman has three kids, 6-year-old Milly, 4-year-old Jimmy and her youngest son Harry who is 2-years-old. 

Harry and Milly have taken to the sport like pros, following their energetic mum out onto the water on paddle boards during her animated classes.

'Milly is a little bit better she could probably do a whole class of stand-up yoga, she said.

'I take them out on the board with me every weekend'

Ms Sanderson says her time spent out on the water practising her yoga poses is pure 'bliss' and she is extremely proud of the fact that she is the first certified instructor in Australia.

Her children love the serene time they spend on the water with their mother 

The mum-of-three sporadically involved herself in the yoga world over the years, but she made it all official last year with her accreditation.   

'I actually used to be a professional water skier and stunt woman, so being on the water is just bliss for me and then combining paddle boarding and yoga is just so much fun.' she said. 

'I grew up on lakes and rivers and water skiing as a kid and now that I'm up here (Gold Coast) with the beautiful salt-water, I've been converted.'

Sharee admits that the poses can be hard on water but says it is 'bliss' 

Sharee has fun during her classes and likes to get people involved in the class 

Her youngest son, Harry, loves to go out on the water with his mother and can do about four poses

Ms Sanderson admits that the standing poses are extremely difficult on the paddle boards but proves that it can be done with some persistence.

'The standing postures are really quite challenging,' she said.

'I love inversions and I find them not too bad, it’s just easier than a standing posture that’s for sure.' 

All the low impact poses, which are closer to the ground, are easier to practice on the paddle boards

Ms Sanderson has recently opened up her own yoga and pilates studio in Helensvale called The Floating Lotus

She has also teamed up with JM Stand Up Paddle, who are one of the market leaders in Australian stand-up paddle boards
