Once the European hub of grandeur and wealth, the canals of Venice have long accommodated adoring tourists from all over the world. 

But for one day each year, the famous waterways play host to a stunning recreation of the lagoon city's history with a colourful pageant of opulent gondolas.

The vessels, used in the past to demonstrate the Italian city's power and riches, sailed past cheering crowds today as part of the Regata Storica, an annual procession of boats which takes place on the first Sunday of September.

A small fleet of gondolas sail under Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal as part of the annual Regata Storica - an annual pageant which recreates the tradition of parading barges and boats once enjoyed by leaders of the ancient Republic of Venice 

Rowers in period dress lead the procession aboard the Bucintoro (pictured) once used to transport the Doge and his wife, along the Grand Canal past St Mark's Basilica. The Flag of Veneto is hoisted at the boat's hull in a nostalgic nod to the former republic

Dating back to the 15th century, the pageant commemorates the arrival of Caterina Cornaro, the wife of King James II of Cyprus, to the floating city in 1489.

Following her arrival, every year the procession continued as a display of the city's wealth, surviving the dissolution of the Republic of Venice and abdication of its last Doge, Ludovico Manin, in 1797.

Leading the procession is the Bucintoro, once the barge of the Doge - the leader of the Republic - and his wife. Adorned in gold and red velvet robes, men in period dress stand in as the leader and his close circle of officials at the boat's hull, with the Flag of Veneto separating them from a team of rowers. 

Starting at St Mark's Bay, gondolas of varying size and colour sail down the Grand Canal, passing beneath its Rialto Bridge as crowds gather on floating stalls.  

After the breakdown of the Republic in 1797 two citizen races were introduced to the festivities. Today, four events take place with competitors separated by age and vessel.  

Aboard the Bucintoro, a small band of trumpet players herald the beginning of the procession. A large Flag of Veneto trails behind in the water as crowds gather on rickety wooden planks and floating stalls 

Spectators gather on Rialto Bridge to watch the pageant pass beneath them. The procession is followed by four competitive races in which gondoliers show off their rowing skills  

The races, designed to showcase gondoliers' skills, start in front of Sant'Elena Gardens which is signposted with a rope - the spagheto. 

A turning post in the centre of the Grand Canal marks the half-way point, with the finishing line marked by a colourful floating stage where victors claim prizes. 

Among the races is one for children, rowing on a two-oared gondola, and a six-oared event for barges. 

The most popular  is the twin-oared gondolini race, during which rowers whiz from St Mark's Bay down the Grand Canal, passing beneath Rialto Bridge and around the paleto of Santa Lucia railway station.
