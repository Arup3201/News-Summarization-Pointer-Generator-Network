From the look on her face, it was clearly an emotional experience.

Armed with her camera phone, a young girl ran up to Princes William and Harry yesterday to take their picture at a polo match.

The two royals duly rewarded her with broad smiles – to the evident excitement of the dark-haired admirer.

The ecstatic young photographer let out a squeal as she dashed back into the crowd, prompting an amused grin from Harry, 28.

He and 30-year-old William had been playing in a charity match at Beaufort Polo Club in Tetbury, Gloucestershire.

As they left the field and made for 
the changing rooms, onlookers reached for their cameras and mobile 
phones to take pictures of the brothers up close.

That was when the girl seized her moment and positioned herself a few steps ahead of the pair with her iPhone in her hand.

It followed a match in which William 
and Harry, on opposing teams, could be seen entering into the 
competitive spirit with gusto as Harry appeared to shoulder barge his 
brother as they fought for the ball.

Harry later received a kiss from a mystery blonde as he left the club.

Elsewhere, the Queen and Princess Beatrice attended the last day of the Cartier polo at the Guards Club in Berkshire.

The Princes appeared relaxed and happy as they chatted with the crowds at the Audi International, which is part of the Gloucestershire Festival of Polo.
