A social experiment has caught Adelaide locals red-handed after a man secretly filmed their reactions as he 'accidentally' dropped his wallet on the sidewalk.

But while thieves thought they were earning some free cash, they were instead left with an unexpected surprise -  cut up paper, receipts, a $100 Monopoly bill and an appearance on YouTube.

Since the video titled 'Dropping My Wallet in Public' was posted on Tuesday, it has had almost 2,500 likes.

Adrian Gruszka, under the username Adrian Gee, uploaded his social experiment video 'Dropping My Wallet In Public' on YouTube on Tuesday

The wallet - filled with cut up paper, receipts and a $100 Monopoly bill - was stolen on four occasions

Out of the 12 incidents, the wallet was returned to its rightful owner eight times

The footage shows Adrian Gruszka, also from Adelaide, walking along the street, seemingly immersed in a phone conversation.

'I pretty much dropped my wallet right in front of their eyes and wanted to see whether they would do the right thing or the wrong thing,' he wrote in the description for the video.

'I was quite shocked with some of the reactions I got on camera.'

The wallet was stolen on four occasions, where two men ran away with their new prized possession.

But not all faith in humanity was lost.

Tallied results showed that out of the 12 incidents, South Australians returned the wallet to its rightful owner eight times - some even chasing after Mr Gruszka.

The prankster has made several other YouTube videos including 'Crying In Public Prank', 'Yelling In The Drive-Thru' and 'Holding Hands With Strangers'.
