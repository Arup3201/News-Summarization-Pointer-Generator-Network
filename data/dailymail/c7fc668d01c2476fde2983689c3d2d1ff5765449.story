Google has signed a 60-year lease for part of a historic Navy air base, where it plans to renovate three massive hangars and use them for projects involving aviation, space exploration and robotics.

The tech giant has agreed to pay $1.16 billion in rent over the next six decades for the property, which also includes a working air field, golf course and other buildings. 

The 1,000-acre site is part of the former Moffett Field Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Peninsula.

Google has signed a 60-year lease for part of a historic Navy air base, where it plans to renovate three massive hangars and use them for projects involving aviation, space exploration and robotics. The tech giant has agreed to pay $1.16 billion in rent over the next six decades for the property

Google also plans to invest more than $200 million (£126 million) to refurbish the hangars, and add other improvements, including a museum or educational facility that will showcase the history of Moffett and Silicon Valley.

In an official statement, Nasa said a Google subsidiary called Planetary Ventures will use the hangars for 'research, development, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies.'

Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have a well-known interest in aviation and space. 

The company recently acquired several smaller firms that are working on satellite technology and robotics, including Boston Dynamics. 

Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics has unveiled the latest tricks its Atlas robot can perform. Dubbed Ian, (pictured) the robot is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in (1.8 metres) tall and weighs in at 330lb (149kg). Roboticists programmed the robot to perform the iconic 'crane kick' pose from the Karate Kid films

Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics has unveiled the latest tricks its Atlas robot can perform. 

Dubbed Ian, the robot is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in (1.8 metres) tall and weighs in at 330lb (149kg).

It boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision, and is one of the most advanced robots ever created.

Roboticists at the firm have programmed the robot to perform the iconic 'crane kick' pose from the Karate Kid films.

At the US Government's recent Robo-Olympics, Ian came second, despite competing as a virtual software simulation. 

Despite his lack of limbs, the world's most innocuously named 'bot was able to walk, carry a fire hose and, most impressively, get in a car and drive it.

'To achieve this level of maneuverability in robots, researchers at IHMC look toward nature,' the team said.

'Inspired by the speed of cheetahs, the endurance of horses, the maneuverability of monkeys, and the versatility of humans, IHMC researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast, efficient, and graceful, with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can.' 

Atlas is powered from an off-board, electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this. 

But a Google spokesperson declined to discuss specific plans for the property, which is located just a few miles from the company's main campus in Mountain View.

Nasa plans to continue operating its Ames Research Centre on the former Navy site, while Google will take over operations at the runways and hangars. 

This includes a structure that was built to house dirigible-style Navy airships in the 1930s. 

Nasa added that the deal will save it $6.3 million (£3.9 million) in annual maintenance and operation costs.  

Google has already leased 42 acres of land at the airfield to build offices and the hangar may form part of these plans. A 29-acre airport terminal, illustration pictured, that will largely service jets owned by Google executives was approved by the San Jose City Council. Google may use the hangar as a focal point for this construction

Google has already leased 42 acres of land at the airfield to build offices.

Last April, a 29-acre, $82-million (£51 million) airport terminal that will largely service jets owned by executives at Google was approved by the San Jose City Council.

This separate lease last covers the next 50 years at the rate of $3 million (£1.8 million) a year in rent.

The new airport will be capable of accommodating the largest jets, including Boeing 737s and 767s, owned by the internet giant's top executives.

Hangar One was built in 1933 to house U.S. Navy blimps after World War I, including USS Macon, pictured

Since Nasa took over the airfield the hangar has fallen into disrepair. 
Its siding, in particular, has been leaking toxins into the San Francisco Bay and the U.S. Navy has removed the building's outer case, pictured, as part of the toxic cleanup. Renovations are set to cost $45 million (£27million)

Since Nasa took over the airfield, the hangar has fallen into disrepair. 

Its siding, in particular, has been leaking toxins into the San Francisco Bay and the U.S. Navy has removed the building’s outer case as part of the toxic cleanup. 

Renovations are expected to cost around $45million (£27million). 

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin previously offered to pay for the renovations, but U.S. officials decided to offer the project out to competitive bids.
