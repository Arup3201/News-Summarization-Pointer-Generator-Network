Aston Villa made it two out of two in pre-season with a 2-0 win over MLS side FC Dallas courtesy of goals from Andreas Weimann and Charles N'Zogbia.

Austrian Weimann scored just before half-time, before N'Zogbia, once thought to be part of Paul Lambert's 'Bomb Squad', doubled Villa's lead.

Gary Gardner blasted over the bar from a good position from 20 yards early on, but the home side had most of the chances.

Andres Escobar should have put the hosts

was high and wide.

Enda Stevens found an opening on the half-hour mark after neat Villa play, but his shot was well saved by Raul Fernandez.

Then, Gardner's mishit had to be parried over the bar from Fernandez as the tourists started to find a foot in the game.

And Paul Lambert's men took the lead just before half-time, with Darren Bent breaking with Weimann, before the former England man laid the ball of to the Austrian to smash home with his left foot despite substitute goalkeeper Richard Sanchez getting a hand to the effort.

Villa rang the changes in the second-half, and Charles N'Zogbia curled home an unstoppable free-kick past Sanchezto double their lead.

Lambert's side looked a fresher outfit in the second-half with a brand new side bar goalkeeper Shay Given, with N'Zogbia going close after a quick break on the right wing.

And N'Zogbia nearly scored again in the dying moments, but his point-blank effort was saved by Sanchez.
