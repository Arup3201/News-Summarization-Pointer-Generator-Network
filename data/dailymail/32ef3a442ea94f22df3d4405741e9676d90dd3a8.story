No Army vehicle currently in service could have protected six soldiers who were killed in a fireball in Afghanistan, an officer said yesterday.

Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, and Privates Anthony Frampton, 20, Daniel Wade, 20, Christopher Kershaw, 19, and Daniel Wilford, 21, all died when a massive roadside bomb ripped apart their Warrior armoured vehicle last year.

The blast flipped the troop carrier over, blew off the gun turret and sent flames 100ft into the air.

But at an inquest into the soldiers’ 
deaths yesterday Major Douglas Nelson, an expert on the Warrior, said: 
‘This was a large device and no vehicle that we have is designed to take
that.’

Significant steps had been taken to bolster the Warrior fleet since the 
tragedy, he said. But he added: ‘They [the insurgents] can always build a
bigger bomb.’

The vehicle was on a routine patrol when it was blown up 
about 25 miles north of the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah.

It was the deadliest single enemy attack on UK forces in Afghanistan since 2001.

Fellow soldiers struggled to extinguish the blaze but ‘nothing could 
have been done to rescue or save them’, said Oxfordshire coroner Darren 
Salter.

Mr Salter said: 'This of course is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives.

'At
least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and 
the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer.

'It also follows that there was nothing that their comrades could have done to rescue or save them.'

Mr Salter recorded a narrative verdict. 

Outlining the events that day, he said: 'The six soldiers were therefore unlawfully killed whilst on active service.'

The vehicle was patrolling with another Warrior when it was blown up about 25 miles north of the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah.

It
was the biggest single loss of life for British forces in Afghanistan 
since an RAF Nimrod crash killed 14 people in September 2006.

The inquest at Oxford Coroners' Court heard that no other vehicle of its type was designed to withstand a blast of its type.

Sgt
Coupe, a member of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, and 
his comrades, all members of the Yorkshire Regiment's 3rd Battalion, 
died of blast injuries caused by the explosion.

Mr
Salter told the court: 'I am not going to second-guess decisions of 
commanders in a courtroom today, that is not the purpose of an inquest.

'These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgments.'

The
inquest heard that improvements have been made to Warriors since the 
incident including better armour, burst resistant fuel tanks, better 
ways of getting in and out in emergencies and improved fire detection 
and protection systems.

The 
court was told that eight new fuel tanks have been fitted so far to the 
vehicles that are being used in Afghanistan, with 21 more due to have 
the upgrade, and the coroner said that 'significant steps' had been 
completed in making improvements to the vehicles.

Mr Salter said there was no need 
for a formal report under his powers because he was satisfied the areas 
of concern had been addressed.

Father-of-two Sgt Coupe, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire; Pte Wade, from Warrington, Cheshire, who was about to become a father; Cpl Hartley, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire; Pte Frampton and Pte Wilford, both from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire; and Pte Kershaw, from Bradford, had all been in Afghanistan for only a few weeks when they were killed.

The court was told it was important to send out the patrol that day, rather than waiting until the next, because of 'force protection' and showing a visible presence to insurgents.

When the order was given at 6pm to leave, Pte Kershaw 'stepped up to the mark' and volunteered to take the place of another soldier on the patrol, who was just returning from the shower, the inquest heard.

The two Warriors left just after 
6.30pm, and soon after, the first Warrior detonated the IED, which was 
triggered by a pressure plate.

The
force of the explosion turned the Warrior on to its side and 'flicked 
off' its turret, with a fire breaking out almost instantly, which then 
went on to set off ammunition inside.

Fellow soldiers struggled to extinguish the blaze and get into the stricken Warrior, but everyone inside was dead.

Speaking after today's verdict, families of the soldiers thanked their colleagues for their efforts to save them.

Pte Kershaw's mother, Monica Kershaw, said: 'This process has been one which a mother never wishes to have to undertake. I feel like I have been involved in a nightmare, from which I can never awake, leaving me emotionally drained.

'From the information we have heard at the inquest, it was a pure quirk of fate that Chris should have been kitted up and got into a patrol for which he was not intended.

'I am still struggling with this - but
how like him to be ready to do his duty for his fellow soldiers. How 
proud I am of his call to duty.'

Pte
Kershaw's father, Brian, who attended the inquest with the teenager's 
stepmother, Sharon, said: 'Chris always knew what he wanted to do and 
followed his heart, he did what his grandfather did and became a 
soldier.

'We hope there is a lesson to be learned from this inquest that will help and protect all soldiers in the future.'

Cpl Hartley's mother, Natalie Taylor, spoke of her pride in her son but hit out at politicians, saying: 'To lose your child is as painful as losing your own life. Our servicemen and women will continue to die as long as politicians who rule our lives value money more than the lives of our sons and daughters.'

Pte Wade's fiancee, Emma Hickman, who has battled to have the identity of their daughter Lexie-Mai officially recognised, said the inquest had been a difficult process but was an important step in finding out what happened on March 6 last year.

'It is important to me that Lexie grows up knowing what happened to her father,' she said.

'From the struggle to establish Lexie's identity and hearing all the evidence it has been an exhausting ordeal and still we have not come to terms with our loss.'

Pte Wade's mother, Lisa Billing, paid tribute to her son as a 'well-respected young man'.

Pte Wilford's mother, Diane Sharples, said her son loved his Army life and was proud of his service.

A statement on behalf of Pte Frampton's family, read by lawyer Michael Davison, said: 'Obviously nothing can bring Anton back but we are grateful that we have answers. 

'We note the verdict the coroner has reached that Anton was killed while on active service. We feel we can take some comfort from the evidence showing that Anton did not suffer.'

Lieutenant Colonel Andy Cox MBE, Chief of Staff Task Force Helmand at the time of the incident, said: 'On behalf of the Army and 12 Mechanized Brigade, I would like to pay tribute to the six outstanding soldiers who tragically lost their lives in this incident.

'These men paid the ultimate sacrifice whilst serving their country and delivering a better future for the people of Afghanistan.

'Their loss is felt keenly across the regiment and the brigade, although this cannot compare to the pain felt by their families and friends. Our thoughts and prayers remain with them today and always.'
