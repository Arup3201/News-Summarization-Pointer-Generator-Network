Transgender rocker Tom Gabel has spoken on camera for the first time as a woman called Laura Jane Grace.

The lead singer of punk band Against Me!, who is married and has a two-year-old daughter, came out as transgender last month, the first major rock star ever to do so.

The 31-year-old spoke this week about the life-altering changes since making the decision and how her family, friends and band mates have been, on the whole, supportive.

True identity: Laura Jane Grace (pictured left) was born as Tom Gabel and is leader singer of punk rock band Against Me!

Laura Jane Grace told MTV: 'I've been completely blown away by the 
majority of people's reactions. ... They've been more than respectful 
and more than supportive, and it's been, for me, completely humbling.'

The rock star knew she was in the wrong body as early as four or five years old when she watched Madonna on TV and wanted to be like her when she grew up - both as a performer and as a female.

She added: 'You don't understand what's happening to you ... though, as you grow older, you realize this isn't something that goes away.

'And you start hearing so many other
people's stories, and you realize, ''That's me. This is what I'm going 
through.'' And it becomes so apparent that you'd be a fool to continue 
to deny it.'

Laura said she is not attracted to men and will still be married to wife Heather, who plans to stay in the relationship as her husband undergoes extensive treatment to 
become a woman.

Gabel will take
hormones, undergo electrolysis and is considering gender reassignment 
surgery but Heather isn't put off by his decision.

'When he starts taking hormones, he’s
gonna get these cute little boobs... I’ve never been attracted to 
girls, but when he has that cute little boob sticking out of the side of
his tank top... hi-ya!' Heather told Rolling Stone in an interview published this month.

Heather has already accepted Laura Jane Grace, as her wife, describing their couple's sex life as 'like normal but better'.

Although the majority of people have been supportive - including Heather's family - the brave decision has ended Laura Jane Grace's relationship with her father, a retired Army major.

The singer explained that as a boy she felt disconnected from her body and suffered from gender dysphoria, which caused her to abuse drugs and alcohol.

'Growing up, my experience with transsexualism was nothing but shame,' she said.

Without the Internet and with the only reference point in popular culture being 'scary trannys or butt-of-the-joke trannys', she said, the only option was to keep the feelings buried and wear women's clothes in secret.

Laura said she only told a few family 
members and close friends about the plan to have a sex change operation 
before going public.

Laura's only reservation about having the operation was how Heather would react to the news.

'But she's been super-amazing and understanding,' he said.

Laura said she opened up about her decision to Rolling Stone Magazine because she is the first major rock star to ever assume a new gender.

Transitioning from a man to a woman requires intense surgeries and years of hormone therapy. Some of the procedures include: 

Vaginoplasty - The man's penis is turned inside-out to create a full-formed vagina.

Breast implants - Hormone therapy will cause patients to grow breasts, but many opt to enlarge them with implants.

Tracheal shave - Cartilage in the throat is removed and the Adam's Apple is reduced

Jaw recontouring - The broad, sharp lines of the man's jaw are softened by shaving down the jawbone.

On hearing the news, friends from the music world came out in support of Gabel.

Indie rock bands 
including Tegan & Sara and Gaslight Anthem expressed support for their
peer, calling the announcement 'so incredibly 
brave'.

Her bandmates from Against Me! have simply said that they want Laura to be happy.

'I'm going to have embarrassing moments and that won't be fun,' she told the June issue of the magazine.

'But that's part of what talking to you is about -- is hoping people will understand, and hoping they'll be fairly kind.'

Though Laura Jane Grace has only recently opened up to fans about issues with sexual identity, there have been hints in the lyrics of Against Me! songs - and in the band's name. 

In 'The Ocean,' on the band's 2007 album 'New Wave,' he sings: 'If I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman / My mother once told me she would have named me Laura.'

Gabel also wrote a song called 'Transgender Dysphoria Blues.'

Against Me! is best known for the song 'Thrash Unreal.'

The group is on tour with The Cult this month across the U.S. before heading to play dates in Europe.
