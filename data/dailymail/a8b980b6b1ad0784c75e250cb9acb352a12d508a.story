Labour last night caved in and backed Government plans for Parliament to investigate the banking scandal instead of a judge-led public inquiry.

Following the most bad-tempered Commons debate for decades, party leader Ed Miliband reluctantly agreed, for now, to back a probe headed by senior MPs and peers, though he insisted it would be ‘inadequate’.

Ministers offered a significant concession, saying a cross-party joint committee of both Houses of Parliament would be given resources to hire a QC who could either advise on the questioning of witnesses, or even conduct it.

Chancellor George Osborne and his opposite number Ed Balls were involved in angry exchanges as MPs debated proposals for an inquiry into the banking scandal. MPs last night voted for a Parliamentary probe into rate-fixing

The Government and the opposition have been arguing for days over the nature of an inquiry into the rate-fixing scandal that has engulfed Britain’s banks, and lessons to be learned about the wider culture and practices of the finance industry.

Labour lost a Commons vote calling for a judicial probe, on the lines of that led by Lord Justice Leveson into the media, but agreed to cooperate with a more rapid Parliamentary inquiry after MPs voted in favour of that instead.

However, shadow Chancellor Ed Balls insisted Labour would continue to press for a broader judicial probe to follow - warning the Government that if future banking scandals emerged it would be blamed.

Chancellor George Osborne and Mr Balls were involved in venomous exchanges as they debated the issue.

Mr Osborne challenged Mr Balls to say who were the ‘Labour ministers’ who raised concerns with the Bank of England about the high rates being declared by Barclays on how much it was paying to borrow at the height of the financial crisis.

The bank has been fined £290million for fiddling the Libor rate - the rate at which banks borrow money from each other - forcing its chief executive Bob Diamond to quit.

‘Do you know who those ministers are?’ the Chancellor demanded, as deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans struggled to maintain order.

‘Let him explain what Labour’s role was. Who were the ministers, who had the conversation, who were the senior figures?’ Mr Osborne asked, saying Mr Balls had to ‘answer for his time in office’ as Labour’s City minister.

The Chancellor mentioned a report called ‘Reducing Libor’ drafted by bankers at UBS and circulated in Whitehall by Baroness Vadera, then a Cabinet Office minister, in 2008.

The peer, who was one of Gordon Brown’s closest economic advisers, has admitted commenting on the report but denied having any conversation with the Bank of England about getting the rate down.

Mr Balls denied any involvement and claimed Mr Osborne’s ‘cheap, partisan and desperate’ conduct ‘demeans the office he holds’.

He complained that the Chancellor had ‘impugned my integrity’ and demanded an apology.

‘If he has any evidence, he should produce it. He should either push up or shut up,’ Mr Balls said.

The Chancellor retorted: ‘The idea that I am going to take lessons in integrity from the man who smeared his way through 13 years of Labour government, who half the people who ever served with him think he was a disgrace in his post is another thing.’

Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi asked Mr Balls: ‘Can you confirm that in your time in office, no other minister either in Number Ten or the Treasury spoke to the Bank of England on Libor that you know about?’

The Shadow Chancellor did not answer directly, telling him: ‘The reason why we advocate an open, public inquiry, judge-led, is to get precisely to the bottom of all these things.’

Mr Osborne said it was ‘completely fanciful’ for Labour to suggest a judge-led inquiry could produce a report that would be completed in time to inform banking reform legislation due early next year.

Since the Inquiries Act was passed in 2005, only one judge-led investigation, into an explosion at a Glasgow plastics factory, had been completed in under two years, he told MPs.

‘The idea that a widespread, judge-led public inquiry into the culture and professional standards of Britain’s largest industry is going to take place much quicker than a public inquiry into the explosion at a plastics factory in Glasgow I think is just fanciful,’ Mr Osborne said.

‘It just leads me to believe that the Labour Party wants to put off the moment when we actually investigate what happened.’

Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the Government’s most senior lawyer, prompted further confusion as he warned criminal charges against bankers could hamper either a judge-led or a Parliamentary inquiry. ‘It could present such a difficulty,’ he told MPs.

Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, who the Government has selected to run the inquiry, had threatened to pull out unless there was cross-party support.

A Labour source said Mr Tyrie was an ‘honourable man’ but claimed his inquiry would be ‘incredibly limited’ in scope.

Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, yesterday criticised the Bank of England over its handling of the rate-rigging scandal.

‘I don’t know what the ECB would have done but I hope we would have done better,’ he said. ‘A lot of action should be taken to improve governance of the Libor process.’

A Treasury source said all Mr Osborne had ever said about Mr Balls specifically was that he had questions to answer, insisting that was ‘undeniably the case’.
