The last of a generation: Con Shiels, 96, died on Boxing Day and was one one of 200 men to take part in the Jarrow March to London

He was the last of the Jarrow Marchers - a famous band of jobless men who walked 300 miles to London to protest about unemployment and poverty during the Great Depression.

Con Shiels was just 20 when he took part in the long journey from the north-east to the capital in 1936 but at the age of 96 he has died after a short illness this Christmas.

The March saw unemployed men walk from Jarrow, on Tyne and Wear, in 
protest at the town's spiral into deprivation following the 
closure of its shipyard.

Led by a mouth organ band, these 200 men became the symbol of hope for many in Britain when they were suffering great poverty.

Carrying an 11,000-name petition, they did so to demand help from the government and then Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin.

Inspired by the plight of his friends and family, Mr Shiels joined his father and the other 
protesters for the marathon journey.

For many years Con told local generations of schoolchildren about the March and the plight of those who took part.

He joined the final leg of the walk into London because his father, Con senior, was an unemployed riveter who became cook for the men on the 
route.

A widower, Con leaves a son and two daughters, along with several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

His daughter, Moya Green, said: 'Dad loved talking about the Jarrow 
March and remained proud of his role in the event throughout his life.

'His memories of those times remained very sharp.'

Heroes: The Jarrow Marchers on their way to London in 1936 - but its last survivor Con Shiels has died aged 96

Inspiration: This band of men walked 300 miles to confront Stanley Baldwin and his Government about the plight of unemployed Britons

Cause: Jarrow's shipyard had been shut so Con's father joined the men as cook and his son arrived later for the final stages

Mr Shiels Snr had written to his son six times en route to the capital 
and his letters are the only which survive from the March.

The march passed into folklore, but sadly their efforts achieved little.

Stanley Baldwin refused to receive them, with the men simply given £1 each towards their train fare home.

Mr Shiels, who lived much of his life in Jarrow, died on Boxing Day.

He later spent 12 years in the Royal Navy, before working as a fitter.

Parish priest Father Peter Martin, who conducted the requiem mass for Mr Shiels this week said: 'In a way, this is closing a chapter of history.

'There can't be any other people who can say they took some part in the Jarrow March.

'Con was often on the box, talking about the march and what it meant."

Steve Turner, a policy director for Unite, wrote on Twitter: 'Always remembered Con Shiels last of the Jarrow marchers (1936) RIP. Growing poverty and unemployment need new 'rage against poverty' 2013.
