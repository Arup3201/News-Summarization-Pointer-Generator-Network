NastyGal founder Sophia Amoruso, a community college dropout who has gone on to build a $100million fashion business, has lifted the lid on her unlikely journey from thief to chief, rags to riches and anti-capitalist to CEO.

‘#Girlboss,’ Ms Amoruso's first foray into writing, has garnered attention since its release this month for the intimate details of the entrepreneur's turbulent past: from being a broke and shoplifting youngster to harnessing the power of the Internet to sell vintage clothing on eBay.

Sitting in her 55,000-square-foot loft office in downtown Los Angeles, the Louis Vuitton-clad Ms Amoruso, 30, oversees hundreds of employees at NastyGal headquarters, her eBay business now a flourishing online fashion brand.

‘But there's also the serendipity of meeting the right person at the right time, and the serendipity of just having the idea at the right time that drives you to actually ask for something rather than have it fall on your lap.’

Because Ms Amoruso started her eBay boutique turned mega brand the age of 22, she was not as concerned with the possibility of failure as many entrepreneurs typically can be.

Nasty Gal formally launched in 2008 after Ms Amoruso’s eBay business had become so large that a standalone site became a plausible idea. Her account on the auction site was terminated soon after amid allegations of ‘linking out’ (leaving eBay without its commission fee), and toying with bids.

The site is named for a song by Betty Davis, and is known for its trendy merchandise, which runs the gamut from haute hippie to Nineties raver - all at an affordable price.

But despite her entrepreneurial spirit, Ms Amoruso says that she never even intended to become a CEO.

‘Failure is, it's like those are the people who are going out in the world and saying, “This is what I want to do, and if this doesn't work, I've failed,” which I never did. I never wanted to be a CEO,' she explained.

‘I mean, I want to be one today but I never intended to be a CEO. I never intended to build a $100 million business. If that was what I was focused on, I think I would be missing all of these things along the way, all of the small things that got us here.’

As for her lack of formal education, Ms Amoruso, a Sacramento, California native, says ‘[College] just wasn't for me. I think it's amazing. I think if you know what value you can derive from college and are mature enough to do that and get what there is to get out of the college experience, it's perfect.

‘If you're unhappy like I was, and too impatient to complete four years of anything at that age, it's not for you.'
