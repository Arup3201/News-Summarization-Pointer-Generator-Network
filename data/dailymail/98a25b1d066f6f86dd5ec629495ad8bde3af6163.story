A Facebook page depicting people blocking mobile speed cameras by pretending they have broken down has been slammed by road safety experts who say the practice is endangering lives.

The Block Their Shot page contains several photos of drivers and passengers pulling up behind the detection vehicles, and coming up with various ways to prevent speeding cars from being captured on film.

At the time of publishing, the page - which also encourages people to join their cause - had attracted more than 32,000 likes.

Most of the photos portrayed New South Wales drivers propping up their hoods to cover the camera lense, while others got a bit more creative.

One man is seen pulling out a lawn chair and camping next to a detection vehicle while he holds up an open umbrella.

In another, brown butcher's paper has been stuck over the camera.

But the campaign does not stop with motorists, cyclists are also getting in on the action.

Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact Block Their Shot's administrators but are yet to receive a reply.

On their page, they claim the mobile speed camera units are used as revenue raisers not to help save lives, referring to them as 'cash grabs'.

But University of NSW's Road Safety Professor Raphael Grzebieta told Daily Mail Australia the people trying to obscure the cameras were treating it like a game, which it was not.

University of NSW's Road Safety Professor Raphael Grzebieta told Daily Mail Australia the people trying to obscure the cameras were treating it like a game

'These people are clowns, they are idiots. They don’t realise they could have blood on their hands with these antics,' he said.

'These people are aiding and abetting people to break the law. 

'That's got to be chargeable, that’s what I would have thought. 

'Putting themselves on Facebook and identifying themselves, depending on what the minister wants to do in the next couple of days, they could be facing some serious fines.'

Professor Grzebieta said speed limits were put in place in case something goes wrong so then it allows people more time to react, so they can avoid being seriously injured or killed.

Driver Safety Australia director Russell White echoed the professor's comments, likened covering up a speed camera to covering up important road signs

He said speed cameras 'absolutely' played a major part in preventing someone from becoming harmed.

'Somewhere between 30 to 40 per cent of fatalities or injuries are speed related,' Professor Grzebieta said.

'Some say speed doesn't kill... but actually speed does kill. 

'If you go above the speed limit, your perception times remain the same, but if you are travelling faster you hit a solid object harder, and you have much higher chance of getting seriously injured or killed.'

Driver Safety Australia director Russell White echoed the professor's comments and likened covering up a speed camera to concealing important road signs.

'To me it's like covering up a stop sign or any other infrastructure, you can end someone's life by doing something stupid like that,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Police should come down on people very hard about that.'
