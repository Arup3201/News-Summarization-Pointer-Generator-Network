Colorado's tax revenue from its much-vaunted legalization of marijuana has fallen far short of estimates.

Original projections for taxes to Colorado for recreational marijuana were $33.5 million for the just-ended fiscal year. Governor John Hickenlooper's office predicted $100 million.

The state hoped to appeal to locals and marijuana tourists alike with its legalize-and-tax tactic, but so far, results have been sluggish.

Governor John Hickenlooper, who signed the measures to implement marijuana legalization in the state, predicted that Colorado would gain $100 million from the taxes.

The actual amount in retail sales and excise tax came in at just over $12 million, according to Colorado Department of Revenue.

State Representative Dan Pabon said it might be time to look at medical marijuana. Pabon chairs a special legislative committee on marijuana revenue that met for the first time Tuesday.

A market study for the state found that the lower-taxed medical-marijuana market continues to outpace the recreational market in sales.

Recreational sales are expected to grow, but Forbes reports that only an estimated 60 per cent of marijuana purchases this year will be through legal channels.

Part of the reason is likely to be cost.

In Colorado, there’s a 2.9 per cent sales tax and a 10 per cent marijuana sales tax.

Forbes reports that there is also a 15 per cent excise tax on the average market rate of retail marijuana. Altogether, that's almost 30 per cent tax.

It could indicate that people are reselling their medical marijuana, obtained at a 2.9 per cent tax rate, on to the public.

State economists are coming out with new forecast next month using the data from the first six months of sales.

'If another lawmaker from a different state came to me and said, "I want legal marijuana sales because of the tax revenue for my state," I'd certainly make it known for them to take caution. It's not what people expected,' said Pabon.
