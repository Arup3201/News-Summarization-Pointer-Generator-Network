Drive Club is very fun. It's just not very pretty.

In fact, for one of the PS4's launch line-up, it's hard to see anything 'next gen' about its visuals.

But it doesn't take long for this racer to start clawing back some points - with its intuitive gameplay mechanics and balanced handling.

Appearances can be deceiving: Don't be fooled, the Drive Club demo looked very different to this image

The playable gameplay demo was only 35 per cent complete and featured one track. Still, there's a remarkable sense of speed. Cars may not be the raw, overly-aggressive beasts that roamed GRID 2, but each one still has its own distinct character.

While the sleek V10 Audi R8 glides gracefully through the corners, the Hennessey Venom GT, spits, hisses and charges through each turn with the elegance of a dumdum bullet.

To stop races feeling stale, you can compete with friends during certain sections - be that to see who can achieve the best drift, or who can complete a certain section fastest. In time trials, they appear as ghosts so it helps you keep track of the competition.

Sadly, for those hoping Drive Club's graphics would be a showcase of PS4's nuclear-powered hardware, you'd be sorely disappointed.

Everything in the demo looked rough and ragged, trees would pop up in the distance, and cars looked lifeless and lacking shine. Interiors, too, although detailed, looked low-res, paling in comparison with upcoming current-gen title, Gran Turismo 6.

There's no denying Drive Club will be enjoyable racer, but it's in need of some serious engine tuning if it's to turn heads on next gen.

Fast and furious: Cars aren't quite the animals seen in GRID 2 but they still have plenty of character
