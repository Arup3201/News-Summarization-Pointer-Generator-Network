Smiling happily as she looks around at her new and improved surroundings, these photographs show how much a major revamp at the Royal Hospital Chelsea means to one of its residents.

Barbara Whilds, 68, is the first female ‘Chelsea pensioner’ to move into the refurbished Long Wards following its transformation to become more modernised over the last year.

Women have been allowed into the Royal Hospital since 2009 when they finally broke through the centuries-old male bastion of Chelsea Pensioner but until now they had live in separate accommodation due to limited bathroom facilities.

The retirement home, which is solely for former members of the British Army who are now 65 years or older, has been revamped to bring it up-to-date and provide better facilities.

Ms Whilds, who became a Chelsea pensioner in 2012, served eight years in the British Army before becoming a nurse at a boarding school. She is the first female veteran to move into the new berths which now each come complete with an en-suite bathroom and study

Founded in 1682 by King Charles II, and designed by Sir Christopher Wren, the hospital cares for elderly and injured soldiers and is home to around 300 male and female pensioners.

Before its refurbishment, each floor of the home - which accommodated up to 36 pensioners - only had one bathroom at the end of the corridor.

The lack of bathroom facilities is one of the main reasons for the refurbishment of the 17th-century hospital, which is set in 66-acres of grounds in the sought-after Chelsea area of London.

It was when the new managers took over around six years ago that plans for the revamp got underway.

They built the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary block, designed by Prince Charles' favourite architect Quinlan Terry, in the north-east corner of the grounds.

The £29m building, funded by donations from the public, came complete with 125 en-suite rooms, a gym, doctor’s surgery, pool and chapel.

The new managers decided they needed to update the living quarters at the Royal Hospital Chelsea and now aim to upgrade all of the berths to include an en-suite bathroom and study by 2015

Last year, they started redesigning the Long Wards wings – the living quarters on the East and West side of the grand building.

Although the original berths, which were designed by Wren, have been slightly extended over the years to their current size of 9 feet squared, they have otherwise remained fairly untouched.

However, the new managers decided they needed bringing into the 21st-century and now aim to upgrade all of the berths to include an en-suite bathroom and study by 2015.

Part of the block has already been completed and former army psychiatric nurse Barbara Whilds has become the first pensioner to move into the new and improved berths.

The first patients at the Royal Hospital Chelsea included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor - a failed uprising against Charles¿ sucessor, James II. Now, it is home to around 300 pensioners

During their time at the hospital, the pensioners wear the traditional uniform, comprising of the distinctive scarlet coats and tricorn hats, as well as their medal ribbons and the insignia of the rank they reached while serving in the military

The Royal Hospital, which since 1913 has also hosted the annual Chelsea Flower Show, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

King
 Charles II, who died in 1685, three years after commissioning it, 
witnessed rapid-paced construction and lived to see the completion main 
hall and chapel.

The first patients included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor - a failed uprising against Charles’ sucessor, James II.

By 1686, Wren had expanded his original design to add two additional quadrangles to the east and west of the central court.

And in 1692, work was completed and the first in-pensioners were admitted in February of that year.

Eligible
 ex-soldiers who could not be housed in the Hospital were termed 
out-pensioners, receiving their pension from the Royal Hospital but 
living outside it.

In-pensioners, by contrast, surrender their army pension and live within the Royal Hospital.

In 1703, there were only 51 out-pensioners. By 1815 this figure had risen to 36,757.

The
 Royal Hospital remained responsible for distributing army pensions 
until 1955, following which the phrase ‘out-pensioner’ became less 
common, and ‘Chelsea pensioner’ was used largely to refer to 
‘in-pensioners’.

Veterans are eligible to become a Chelsea Pensioner over the age of 65.

During
 their time at the hospital, the pensioners wear the traditional 
uniform, comprising of the distinctive scarlet coats and tricorn hats, 
as well as their medal ribbons and the insignia of the rank they reached
 while serving in the military.
