These are some of the terrifying goods for sale on a new black market website inspired by the Lord of The Rings books.

Middle Earth Marketplace, named after the fictional world of the Tolkien novels, exists in the shady underbelly of the internet known as the darknet where criminals use special software and the digital currency Bitcoin to evade law enforcement.

Currently on offer are illegal drugs of every type, guns, ammunition as well as a fearsome knuckle duster stun gun that claims to deliver a 950,000 volt punch.

Sellers and administrators use names such as Gandalf, Bilbo and Laketown taken from the Lord of The Rings and Hobbit books and the site features images of scenes and characters from the hit films.

Weapon: This second hand 9mm pistol is offered to purchasers anywhere in the world

Middle Earth was set up after the original darknet marketplace Silk Road, dubbed the eBay of drugs, was shut down following a sting operation by the FBI in 2013.

Silk Road's creator Ross Ulbricht, who was known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts', was last week convicted on seven drug and conspiracy charges.

Prosecutors said he enabled more than a million drug deals through the site and earned about $18 million in bitcoins.

Middle Earth was one of several illegal 'market places' that emerged to fill the void following the closure of Silk Road but its gimmicky use of Lord of the Rings imagery appears to be putting it ahead of its rivals.

One item currently up for sale is described as a 'knuckle-blaster stun gun' which is said to be able to incapacitate a person by delivering a 950,000 electric shock with a single touch. It is being sold for 0.222 bitcoins - around £32.

A powerful Glock handgun, a type favoured by many police forces, is on sale for just over nine bitcoins - around £1,300 - and comes equipped with two magazines. The seller promises to deliver anywhere in the world.

Also on offer is a cheaper American-made Keltec 9mm handgun for 7.27 bitcoins - around £1,060. The seller describes it as 'reliable', claiming it has been test fired to ensure there are 'no issues'.

Drugs: A vast selection of different types of marijuana are available for sale on the 'dark net' website

Information: Illegal instruction manuals on everything from how to hack computers, how to make bombs and how kill somebody without getting caught are for sale on Middle Earth Marketplace

Quantity: This drug dealer based in the Netherlands offers to send 1kg of cocaine anywhere within Europe

Among the hundreds of drug deals on the site was one for a whole kilo of cocaine priced at 154.2 bitcoins (£22,572).

Single grams of cocaine were being advertised for 0.36 bitcoins (£53).

Meanwhile ten grams of 'Amnesia Haze' cannabis was offered for 0.5839(£85) and five 'Orange Turtle' ecstasy tablets, shipped from the Netherlands were priced at 0.0898 (£13) bitcoins.

A U.S. passport card, that can be used to enter the United States from sea ports or from Canada, Mexico the Carribbean or Bermuda, was offered for 4.49  bitcoins (£657).

Pre-fabricated EU driving licenses were selling for 4.49 bitcoins (£657) while a digital template for a UK driver's license designed to be printed out by the buyer was advertised for 0.063 bitcoins (£9).

Bitcoins were launched in 2008 by the Japanese inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Initially worthless, the currency was still valued at only £1.30 by December 2011. 

But an explosion in its use saw it peak in November 2013 when a single bitcoin was valued at around £821. Today a bitcoin is worth around £140.

Due to this fractions of bitcoins are now used to enable the purchase of cheaper goods with 0.1 bitcoins currently worth approximately £14.

Fake: Fake driving licences, credit cards and personal identification cards are on sale on the Middle Earth site

More drugs: This French seller describes the cannabis he is selling as 'very fruity' with a 'lemon taste'

A vast array of Fake IDs, from forged UK Driving Licences to fake American Express Credit cards, is advertised along with books and literature discussing illegal activities.

But the majority of transactions appear to be illegal drugs including cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, LSD and many others in quantities ranging from small amounts for personal use to kilograms at a time.

In a recent interview, given anonymously to a darknet news site, one of the administrators boasted that many of the dealers who previously sold their wares on Silk Road have since migrated to Middle Earth.

However he adds that unlike Silk Road, Middle Earth draws the line by not offering 'assassination services' - contract killers for hire or child pornography.

Pills: Ecstasy tablets are sold in packs of five on the website by a seller based in the Netherlands

Firepower: 9mm ammunition is see for sale of the Middle Earth Marketplace 'dark net' website

Transactions are carried out using the digital currency bitcoin and messages between buyers and sellers are encrypted with ciphers, similar to those used by the Nazis in World War Two, in order to ensure their details can't be traced.

Bitcoin is the world's most popular digital currency and while it is perfectly legal to own and use, it is so synonymous with the darknet that following the Silk Road bust in 2013 its value plummeted by 20 per cent.

Police forces have been slow to respond to the threats posed by the darknet - but are now setting up specialist units to tackle the problem.

In the UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced in December that a team was being set up primarily to hunt down paedophiles using the dark net to share child pornography.

And in the US work is underway to create a specialist search engine which can trawl through the darknet and root out illegal websites and their users.
