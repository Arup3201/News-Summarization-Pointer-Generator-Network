Three family members on vacation died in the street after a runaway minivan smashed through a guardrail and on to the sidewalk, killing them and the driver.

Grandmother Esther Terrero De Diaz, 53, and her grandchildren Franklin, 14, and 13-year-old Adriana were hit by the vehicle on Saturday evening. 

The family had stopped over in Miami, Florida for three days and had just been watching baseball at  Marlins Park when the freak accident occurred as they returned to their car.

The driver of a Dodge Caravan Raul Herberto Ortega, 67, lost consciousness behind the wheel and smashed through a guardrail on to the sidewalk and into the family. Mr Ortega also died in the accident.

Abrahan Diaz, 58, witnessed first-hand the van hit his wife and grandchildren. His ten-year-old granddaughter Magdeline was the only one to survive and remains in hospital in a critical condition.

A cyclist suffered minor injures in the collision.

In a statement in the Miami Herald, the Diaz family said: 'There are no words to describe the affliction that has overtaken us.

We … express our most sincere sympathy and prayers to the family of Mr. Ortega, who has also lost a loved one. Please keep our family in your prayers.'

The Diaz family had been on their way home to Lawrenceville, Georgia after a four-week stay in the Dominican Republic.

They had planned to visit a family friend in Miami for several days who Mr Diaz had recently got in contact with via Facebook after 20 years. 

Ten-year-old  Magdeline remains at Jackson Memorial Hospital after having surgery for several fractures. She is said to be in a stable condition with her parents and grandfather at her side.

The family has arranged for the bodies of Mrs Terrero De Diaz and her granddaughter Adriana to be returned to the Dominican Republic where they both lived. Franklin Diaz's body will be returned to Georgia.
