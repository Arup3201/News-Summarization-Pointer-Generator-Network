When the world and his dog (and baby and Lego man) has mocked you, the only thing to do is try to laugh it off.

David Cameron today ditched the his serious selfie pose to meet Bill Clinton, after spawning hundreds of parodies of his Twitter photo calling Barack Obama.

The Prime Minister told actor Patrick Stewart, who posed with a tub of Wet Ones instead of a phone: 'Talking to another US President, this time face to face, not on the phone.'

Prime Minister David Cameron's selfie was supposed to portray him as a serious statesman with a direct line to the White House

The tweet featuring Mr Clinton was a reference to the derision which greeted a photograph of Mr Cameron speaking on the telephone on Wednesday night.

For a man who once warned that 'too many tweets might make a t***', Mr Cameron really should have known better.

After President Obama was pictured in the Oval Office on the phone to Vladimir Putin, the Prime Minister tweeted a photograph of himself looking serious as he called the US president from No 10.

Mr Cameron wrote: 'I've been speaking to @BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions.'

But his keenness to show he has a direct line to the White House seems to have backfired, with the statesmanlike pose he no doubt hoped would impress the public bringing a torrent of online mockery from celebrities and others.

US comic Rob Delaney responded to Mr Cameron's tweet by posting a picture of himself, looking just as serious, holding a toothpaste tube instead of a phone.

Delaney, who has more than 900,000 Twitter followers, says to Mr Obama and Mr Cameron: 'Hi guys, I'm on the line now too. Get me up to speed.'

Next to join the teasing was Star Trek and X-Men star Sir Patrick Stewart, who posed with a tub of Wet Ones in place of a phone, saying: '@robdelaney @David_Cameron @BarackObama I'm now patched in as well. Sorry for the delay.'

One Twitter user, Michael Moreno, held up a dog to his ear and tweeted: 'Ok, guys, thanks for holding.'

Another tweet showed Mr Obama on the phone looking bemused with the caption: 'David who?' Other users posted pictures suggesting Mr Cameron was not in fact on the telephone to Mr Obama.

Creative tweeters posted pictures of a dog, Batman, Lego figure and even various sex-line workers holding phone handsets to suggest Mr Cameron was calling them instead.

Mr Cameron had called President Obama from his Downing Street office on Wednesday night to discuss Russia's incursion into Crimea and the need to deter any further action by President Putin.

The Prime Minister's most recent gaffe is not the first time he has been the butt of jokes on Twitter over a distasteful use of a selfie.

Last year he was criticised for posing for a selfie with Mr Obama and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at the memorial service honouring the life of Nelson Mandela.

The three were criticised as insensitive for taking the photograph, in which they were all shown grinning, at the service in tribute to the former South African president.
