Sainbury's may be forced to remove its iconic orange branding after residents in an upmarket seaside town complained it wouldn't fit in.  

Residents of sleepy Frinton-on-Sea in Essex spoke out against plans for a new store to be built, claiming it will 'ruin' the appearance of the town.

The store will be built on Connaught Avenue, where other retailers are forced to adhere to a strict 'shop front design guide' issued by Frinton and Walton Town Council.

Councillors raised concerns at a town hall meeting last week. 

Some demanded the supermarket use black and gold lettering as its logo to match the original J. Sainsbury opened in 1869 in Drury Lane, London.

'The whole of Frinton will welcome a Sainsbury’s so they don’t have to plaster it with orange for everyone to know where it is,' said Mark Cossens, councillor for Holland and Kirkby. 

Brian Johnson, councillor for Hamford, said: 'This is Frinton-on-Sea and we try as hard as we can to protect it for people.

'We don't want it ruined'. 

Mr Johnson added: 'Most people are, or were, perfect gentlemen in Frinton-on-Sea.' 

Sainsbury’s representatives were sent away to revise the plans ahead of a planning application to Tendring District Council later this year.

A representative for the supermarket told the meeting: 'The reason we are here is because we want to understand the wider views and be receptive of them.

Councillors said the coastal town had to be protected and had always looked a certain way 

Residents in Frinton previously turned down plans for a branch of the budget supermarket, Aldi

'We feel the plan is in-keeping with the surrounding area, but we are trying to be considerate to Frinton.

'We will take suggestions back to Sainsbury’s.'

 In January plans to build a branch of the budget supermarket Aldi were frostily met, with councillors calling for more upmarket bidders such as Waitrose.

Mayor Iris Johnson told Sainsbury’s bosses: 'The shop front is extremely important to us.

'We spent a lot of time on our shop front design guide.

'Connaught Avenue is a wonderful avenue with some beautiful buildings, but in the not too distant past some people have got away with doing things we would not like repeated.'
