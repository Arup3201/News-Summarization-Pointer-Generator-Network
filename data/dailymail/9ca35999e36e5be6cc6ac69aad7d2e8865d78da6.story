The retrial of a Polo millionaire for DUI manslaughter has been put at risk after a juror snuck a laptop into his hotel room to apparently check on his Fantasy Football team.

John Goodman, 51, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing 23-year-old Scott Wilson in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in February 2010.

But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out when a mistrial was declared because of juror misconduct.

Now, another juror - Juror No. 3 - has thrown the retrial into doubt after violating a rule against unsupervised computer use by sneaking a laptop into his West Palm Beach hotel room.

The jurors - who are all being sequestrated at the hotel in a bid to stop them finding out this is Goodman's second trial - are only permitted to use the internet under the watch of deputies.

They are also forced to log in and out of their iPads, tablets and other devices - which are only allowed in a specific lounge area at the venue - and do not have access to television.

But despite the strict restrictions, Juror No 3 somehow took his laptop into his private room on Sunday afternoon and searched the web, according to The Sun Sentinal. 

He was caught when he refused to provide his laptop password to a Sheriff's Office supervisor, prompting the suspicious official to allow a deputy to check the device's usage history.

Wrecked: But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out. In the retrial, the jurors will not see the $200,000 Bentley (pictured) that Goodman was driving at the time of the crash

During questioning, the juror claimed he only used the laptop to access Bleacherreport.com and Fantasy Football at Yahoo.com to check football scores, ABC News reported.

'No news sites whatsoever,' the man told the court. 'I have not been compromised at all.'

However, Judge Jeffrey Colbath, who found out about the incident via text message at 5am yesterday, expressed concern about the juror's claims.

'It may be that he’s being disingenuous when he says "The computer just magically appeared in my room",' he told the court.

'It flies in the face of their procedures... of common sense... He's not following the court's instructions.'

Despite Juror No. 3's violation and Judge Colbath's concern, the prosecution and defense are allowing the juror to continue on the case.

The judge agreed there was time to revisit the incident before the jury - which was selected in Tampa - begins deliberating over a verdict.

It comes just a day after it was revealed that the jurors will not be shown the $200,000 Bentley that Goodman was driving when he allegedly ran a stop sign and smashed into Mr Wilson's car at speed. sending it into a canal.

They will also not see the Hyundai that the engineering graduate was travelling in when he plummeted into the water and drowned, according to ABC News. 

This is because officials ordered the release of the two vehicles after Goodman, the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach, was convicted in his first trial. The cars were crushed.  

Earlier this week, Palm Beach Homicide Detective Troy Snelgrove told the new jury that Goodman appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the fatal crash.

At the time, the millionaire's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 percent, more than twice the legal driving limit, and he smelt strongly of the substance, he said.

Yesterday, Facundo Paredes, the valet at the bar where Goodman had been drinking before the crash, said the businessman did not seem impaired when he handed him the keys.

However, forensic toxicologist Dustin Tate Yeatman said it was still possible Goodman was intoxicated at the time.

'Someone who drinks alcohol on a daily basis could potentially have a significant tolerance,' he told the court on the eighth day of the retrail.

Last week, a local bartender  testified that Goodman bought 18 drinks before the crash, including tequila shots and a vodka drink, but said he shared them between friends.

Evidence presented in court showed that the mogul's bill at the venue came to around $272.

Tragic: Goodman said he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate (pictured with his mother), who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time

However, Goodman's lawyers claimed that he was not driving while drunk, but instead had a drink following the incident to calm his nerves. 

Speaking in the first trial, Goodman also said his brakes had malfunctioned before the crash. 'I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said.

He added that he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate, who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time.

He told the court that if he had known, he 'would have done whatever I could have done to help'.

Couple: In  March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins. Above, the couple together

In a stunning move in March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins, 44, which would have entitled her to a large amount of his children's $300million trust fund.

The adoption papers stated that Ms Hutchins, who has been dating the millionaire since 2009, was entitled to at least a third of his trust, according to the Palm Beach Post.

At the time, Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, said Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets.

A Miami appeals court later ruled that the businessman could not adopt Ms Hutchins.

Goodman's appeal for a retrial was granted after juror Dennis DeMartin, 69, was found guilty of misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife's DUI during jury selection. 

'A juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer's worst nightmare,' Goodman's attorney Roy Black wrote in a statement at the time.  

If Goodman is convicted again of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, he faces 16 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
