Bizarre footage has emerged of Sean Price, who is accused of murdering a 17-year-old school girl, delivering online rants posted two weeks before he was arrested.

Price is charged with killing Masa Vukotic who was stabbed to death just 500 metres from her home on Tuesday.

He attended a police station hours after they released CCTV footage of a man in a red T-shirt holding a plastic bag getting on a bus near the Doncaster park - in Melbourne's east - where Masa was found.

Murder accused Sean Price has appeared in a video posted online where he talks about his ears getting 'raped'

Price is charged with killing Masa Vukotic, 17, who was stabbed to death just 500 metres from her house on Tuesday

In videos posted online, Price fronts the camera with a beanie hat tightly pulled over his ears.

He talks about his ears being 'raped' and that they now 'very rarely ever go out'.

He starts one of the videos - seen by Daily Mail Australia - by sharing his thoughts on criminals.

'These people who do these crimes don't think about the consequences and the aftermath,' Price said.

'It's all about having a good time, about instant gratification.'

The man, who was holding a white plastic bag, got on a bus on Doncaster Road at 7.09pm on Tuesday, just after Masa was murdered

Price also gives an insight into what he used to be like before his ears were 'violated'.

'I used to be pretty happy, pretty relaxed... My ears have feelings, they're real,' he said.

Throughout the footage, Price does not remove his beanie and reasons: 'I'd let you see my ears but if I do I'm trusting you. Don't break my trust again.'

In another video, he raps in an American accent while heavy metals plays in the background.

'Who the f*** is interested in ears... You've got a thing for bush on ears,' Price chanted.

Price appeared at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday charged with murder in the stabbing of Ms Vukotic.

He was also charged with six other offences - including one count of rape, two counts of robbery and three counts of common law assault including an attempted carjacking.

Ms Vukotic's grief-stricken father, Slabvoljub Vukotic, locked eyes with Price during the court hearing.

Mr Vukotic, wearing dark sunglasses and a black fleece, sat less than 10 metres away from Price with a police liaison officer.

Price wore a white T-shirt and was flanked by two security guards behind a glass screen in the dock.

He looked back at the teenager's father, while also frequently closing his eyes.

He also put his fingers in his mouth when he first sat down. A friend of Ms Vukotic's was heard shouting 'coward' in court when Price was eventually led from the dock by security guards.

Price did not speak throughout the hearing. 

Friends and family have visited the scene of Masa's murder, leaving condolence messages for the teenager

The flowers and tributes started building on Wednesday and filled the entire area, just before the park

Tim Draper, Masa's boyfriend, was seen leaving a heartbreaking love note to the teenager. He was comforted by a friend as he broke down in tears

This was a stark contrast to the man who arrived on Thursday for questioning at St Kilda police station.

News cameras captured Price giving the middle finger and smiling as he was flanked on either side by police officers in a blue forensic suit while he was driven into the complex.

He will re-appear again in May and during a committal mention in June.
