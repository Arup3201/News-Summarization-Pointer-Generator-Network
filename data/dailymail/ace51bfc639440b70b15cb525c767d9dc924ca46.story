Houshang Jafari, a self-styled lord, had moved his 33-year-old lover into his £1.2million flat saying he was allowed a second wife under Sharia law.

The couple had married in Iran in 1978 and in all that time Mr Jafari, 60, had never told his wife that he loved her.

Instead he would leave her and their three children for days at a time while he had relationships with other women, Bristol County Court was told.

The court heard that the property developer had now moved out of the family home in Downleaze, Bristol, to be with his mistress, Katrina, in his luxury apartment in the city's historic Dower House.

It was claimed his lover now uses the title 'Lady Jafari', but is not legally married to him.

Giving evidence, Miss Bidaki, 53, who uses her maiden name, claimed Mr Jafari moved out of their home after moaning about her cooking.

She claimed she previously ignored his womanising, but could not overlook the fact that Katrina was pregnant again.

She said: 'He had other relationships but I put up with it for the sake of my marriage. I put up with it because my family would say it would pass and once he was older and wiser it would be fine.

'What I didn't know was that this time it was serious. There was a two-year-old boy and she was pregnant with another. Then I realised I am not going to put up with it. I could not compete with a woman 20 years younger than myself. He didn't care about me.'

Miss Bidaki said she had wanted to divorce him before, but under Sharia law she would not have been able to take her three children with her. Mr Jafari later agreed to buy her a three-bedroom house, a car and pay her a monthly amount.

But she claims the cash stopped coming and the house never materialised.

She said she then received notice that their family home was no longer owned by them because Mr Jafari had used it to secure a loan.

Miss Bidaki told the court she feared she could become homeless – while her husband lives in luxury.

However Mr Jafari denied her claims. He said: 'What she is saying is being orchestrated by the children.'

She is saying it so she can get them money. That is the purpose of this divorce.' He admitted never telling his wife that he loved her. In reply, Miss Bidaki said: 'My love was unconditional love. When I was married to my husband I was 19.

'He would go out and be gone for days and come home in a different shirt. I was not able to sleep at night. He was cheating all the way through the 35 years many times. I said “I love you” but my real love was keeping my marriage and continuing my job being a housewife.'

Mr Jafari hit the headlines in 2010 when he was jailed for a year for attacking a helicopter that had landed outside his flat. The businessman flew into a rage because the Jet Ranger blew debris at his Land Rover.

He tried to open the pilot's door before kicking the aircraft, throwing a plastic bag full of chicken bones towards the rotor and holding on to the skid bar causing the chopper to  lurch dangerously to one side.

The hearing continues.
