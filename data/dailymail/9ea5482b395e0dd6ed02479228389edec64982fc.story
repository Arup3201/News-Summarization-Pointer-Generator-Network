A religious court has ordered an Israeli woman to circumcise her son against her will - or pay a fine of $140 a day.

The woman refused to let her son be circumcised under Jewish law because she said it would 'mutilate' him.

But her husband, with whom she is reportedly getting divorced, demanded that the ritual take place, The Times of Israel reported.

Jewish ritual circumcisions usually take place in a synagogue eight days after the baby boy's birth.

Unprecedented: A woman is being forced to circumcise her son by Jerusalem's Rabbinical court

Named Brit Milah in Hebrew, the 
ceremony by a specialist rabbi called a mohel is a key part of the 
Jewish faith and is followed by a celebration dinner.

But
the unnamed Jerusalem woman told Israeli media: 'I’ve been exposed to a
lot of material regarding circumcision and I have decided not to 
circumcise my son.

'I have no right to cut his organ and mutilate him. And the court has no right to force me to do so.'

By last night the fine had reportedly already accumulated for five days, reaching $700.

The
decision to force the woman to have her son circumcised was taken 
previously by a Rabbinical court, which upholds Jewish law, in her home 
town of Netanya.

Controversial: Religious figures in Jerusalem, pictured, were angry when circumcision was condemned by the Council of Europe last month. Leaders called on religious communities to prove the practice was safe

The woman appealed to a larger Rabbinical court in Jerusalem but the decision was upheld.

This week's decision over the woman's son, who is now a year old, has been described as unprecedented.

It is thought the woman will now appeal to Israel's secular Supreme Court.

Last
month the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe sparked anger
in the Jewish and Muslim communities when it passed a resolution 
condemning religious circumcisions, questioning if they were against 
boys' human rights.

The 
resolution called on all states to 'clearly define the medical, sanitary
and other conditions to be ensured for practices such as the 
non-medically justified circumcision of young boys'.

It also covered female genital mutilation, a practice which has been widely condemned including by British home secretary Theresa May and is illegal in the UK.

The judges wanted to stand up to legal fights against circumcision in the United States and Europe, according to Israeli news programme Haaretz.

They added: 'The public in Israel stands united against this phenomenon, seeing it as another aspect of the anti-Semitic acts that must be fought.'
