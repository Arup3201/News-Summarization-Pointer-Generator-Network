A fast-acting drug for the most lethal form of skin cancer is set to be made widely available on the NHS.

The drug dabrafenib can quickly help patients with a certain type of melanoma - even if they are severely unwell or bedridden - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said.

Marketed by pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, dabrafenib has been shown to have 'rapid positive effects' and enabled some people to resume everyday activities.

Final draft guidance from the drug watchdog said the medication should be made available - as long as it was sold to the NHS at a discount.

Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, affecting more than 13,000 Britons annually and killing 2,000 patients a year.

It is now the fifth most common cancer and is now the most common cancer in young people aged 15-34 in the UK.

In the past decade, cases of the disease have increased by over 50 per cent. 

Experts blame the rise on the explosion in package holidays by sun-seekers starting in the 1960s, as well as young people spending more time than ever before in pursuit of a tan that often leads to cancer-causing sunburn.

The drug, which is also known as Tafinlar, targets a specific type of melanoma which tests positive for the BRAF V600 mutation.

This mutation causes skin cells to multiply more rapidly, speeding up the spread of skin cancer.

Dabrafenib works by causing cancer cells with the mutation to die, which can slow or stop the growth of the cancer.

The guidance says it should be made available for patients who tested positive for the mutation and whose cancer had spread or could not be completely removed by surgery.

Professor Carole Longson, director for the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at NICE, said: 'For a long time, the treatments available for skin cancer which has spread have been very limited.

'However, in recent years, a number of breakthrough treatments that can potentially significantly improve the prognosis for some people with malignant melanoma have become available.

'NICE has already recommended vemurafenib and ipilimumab and we hope to add dabrafenib to the list of options available.

'The information provided by GlaxoSmithKline, who market the drug, suggested that dabrafenib works just as well as vemurafenib which also targets melanoma with the BRAF V600 mutation.

'Drugs like dabrafenib are also thought to have very rapid positive effect for patients, even in those who are very unwell or bed-ridden.

'In some cases, it has enabled people to resume everyday activities.'

Professor Paul Workman, interim chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, welcomed the news.

He said: 'It's great news that Nice has given the green light to use of dabrafenib on the NHS.

'Its approval underlines the importance of a new generation of cancer drugs targeted at specific molecular features of tumours - drugs which after years of painstaking development are now making their way to patients.

'The discovery of dabrafenib was underpinned by research done here at The Institute of Cancer Research, and its approval increases the treatment options available on the NHS for patients with metastatic melanoma.'

Cases of melanoma have increased by over 50 per cent in the past decade, with experts blaming the rise in package holidays in the 1960s as well as young people burning in their quest for a tan
