A phrase used by the Nazis to greet each other was blurted out by a German headmistress at the start of a school go-kart race, with the teacher now under investigation over the matter.

The unnamed head left pupils, parents and other teachers in a state of shock when she shouted ‘Sieg Heil’ to seventh and eighth-graders in the main hall of the secondary school in Weissenburg in Bavaria.

She had apparently been meaning to wish them good luck, but yelled the controversial greeting - which means 'hail victory' - instead.

The phrase is illegal in Germany and uttering it can even lead to a jail sentence.

Recently a football fan was banned from Dortmund football club for six years for shouting the phrase at a minute’s silence held before a match.

Shouting 'Sieg Heil' was often accompanied by a right-arm salute by members of the Nazis party.

The head told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: ‘I'm a bit politically immature. It just came out and now unfortunately I can't take it back.’

One of the horrified teachers told the paper: ‘How am I supposed to plausibly stop my pupils from using Nazi slogans when our boss is leading the way in them?’

Police were immediately called to the school after the incident and the Bavarian Culture Ministry has launched a probe into the controversy, according to The Local.

The headmistress has been in charge at the school since 2012.
