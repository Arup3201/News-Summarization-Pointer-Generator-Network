Romance: Newcastle-born Donna Air has been dating James Middleton since February

For Daybreak viewers, it was hard to tell what came as more of a surprise.

The sight of former lads’ mag favourite Donna Air presenting from such an upmarket yachting event – or the curious absence of her once famous Geordie accent.

But given that she is now dating the brother of the future Queen of England, perhaps it is only natural that the model appears so desperate to leave behind her working class roots.

The 34-year-old stunned viewers who tuned in to the ITV breakfast show yesterday after she began presenting a live report from the Cowes Week regatta on the Isle of Wight. She was introduced by presenter Kate Garraway as a ‘keen yachtswoman’.

However, audiences were then left in a further state of bemusement when Miss Air appeared to put on a peculiar posh accent, slipping in and out of a plummy British drawl with faint traces of an Australian twang.

Her attempts to wrestle with her natural accent came as an opportunistic Miss Garraway hijacked the interview after just two questions about Cowes, instead trying to engage Miss Air in conversation about her romance with James Middleton.

Less than 60 seconds in to Miss Air’s report from Cowes harbour, Miss Garraway abruptly steered the conversation away from sailing, to ask: ‘Talking about going overboard, tell us about the blossoming romance with James Middleton. Have you gone overboard on him? How did you both meet?’

Miss Air giggled, before attempting to brush off the question by saying: ‘I’m here just to talk about Cowes week today.’

Despite Miss Garraway’s repeated pleas, Miss Air refused to elaborate before the interview was ended, with fellow Daybreak host John Stapleton left to tell viewers: ‘I don’t think we’re going to go very far with that one, are we?’

Viewers immediately took to Twitter to berate the star for dropping the thick North-East dialect she was once known for during her days as a child star on programmes including Byker Grove, and as a presenter for MTV.

New voice: The former lads' mag favourite surprised viewers with her posh accent as she spoke at Cowes yacht regatta in the Isle of Wight

She was accused of trying to sound posh after it was revealed that she is now dating the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother.

Natalie McCormack wrote: ‘Donna Air! What’s happened to your accent? I know you’re dating a Middleton, but you’re from Newcastle not Windsor!’

Joanne Salmon wrote: ‘I’m sure Donna Air was a Geordie? From watching her on Daybreak she appears to be some sort of fake toff.’

Katie D’Arcy said: ‘We know where you come from pet and they don’t sound like that there!’ Catherine Finkle added: ‘Donna Air seems to have forgotten her time at Byker Grove and the fact she’s from Newcastle with that hilarious accent.’

A further comment from James Matthews read: ‘Last time I heard Donna Air speak she was a broad Geordie. All of a sudden she’s talking with a Queen’s English twang?’ 

Newcastle-born Miss Air began a discreet relationship with 26-year-old James Middleton in February, after they met at 5 Hertford Street, a private members’ club in Mayfair.

Blossoming: Miss Air has reportedly been given the approval by James' sister Pippa who he shares a flat with in Chelsea

They were initially reluctant to be seen together, but were soon spotted holding hands on dog-walking dates in Hyde Park, and out for drinks with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Despite the age gap and their 
different backgrounds, the relationship reportedly has the approval of 
Mr Middleton’s sister Pippa, with whom he shares a flat in Chelsea.

Mr
Middleton works for his parents’ party products website in Berkshire 
and runs his own Cake Kit Company, which produces cake-making kits and 
novelty cakes.

By contrast, 
Miss Air, the daughter of a builder who began her showbusiness career as
a child star in TV show Byker Grove, before working as a presenter for 
MTV in the 90s and appearing on the cover of a host of men’s magazines.

The presenter also has a colourful romantic past.

Six
years ago, she separated from multi-millionaire zoo and casino owner 
Damian Aspinall. The pair never married, but have a nine-year-old 
daughter, Freya. It was rumoured they broke up after Mr Aspinall refused
to marry Miss Air.

Since the split she has dated several 
rich, older men, including John Dorrance IV, the London-based American 
heir to the Campbell’s soup fortune, and Sam Goldstone, a Cheshire-born 
millionaire.

Miss Air 
recently blamed the softening of her broad Newcastle dialect on the fact
she has lived in London for almost 20 years, despite the fact her 
fellow Byker Grove co-stars Ant and Dec have retained theirs.

She said: ‘Obviously I have lost my accent slightly, which I appreciate. But it’s because I’ve probably lived in London longer than I lived in Newcastle.

‘When I go home it comes back and when I get cross apparently, or slightly tipsy.’
