But hours later, her distraught mother Nicola had to say farewell at her bedside after doctors were unable to save her.

Mrs Pyatt, 32, had been at home in Clayton, Staffordshire when she received a phone call from Butlin's saying Jessica had been taken ill during her half-term break at the Lincolnshire resort.

Jessica was rushed to the Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, where her condition rapidly deteriorated as she died on October 28.

When Mrs Pyatt and her husband Andy had reached the hospital, they were told the ruptured stomach had caused irreparable damage and there was no hope of the teenager surviving.

'They had been having a ball on the Friday,' said Mrs Pyatt. 'Then on the Saturday, Jessica wasn't feeling well.

'When they said there was nothing more they could do, my first words were, 'No, she can't die. I've already got her Christmas presents.' I told them they had to do something.'

Jessica's funeral was held this week and her entire year group at Thistley Hough High school in Penkhull formed a guard of honour as her horse-drawn coffin travelled past the school.

Her friends also staged a celebration of her life at the school, featuring songs, Jessica's own stories and video clips.

Mrs Pyatt, who attended the celebration with her husband, added: 'I'm overwhelmed and amazed by what they've done in memory of Jessica.'
