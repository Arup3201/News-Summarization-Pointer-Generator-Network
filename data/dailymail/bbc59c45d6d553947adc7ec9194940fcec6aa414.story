Found: The body of Mark Bamford, 67, was found three weeks after his stricken boat was discovered off the coast of Greece

The body of a British sailor has been found three weeks after his stricken boat was discovered off the coast of Greece.

Mark Bamford, 67, had been missing since the start of October when he failed to rendezvous with partner Amanda Morgan in Syracuse, Sicily.

The father-of-two, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, a life-long boating enthusiast and keen traveller, was sailing from Methoni in Greece to Syracuse when he, a fellow crewman and their 45ft trimaran, Pulau Tiga, disappeared.

His body was discovered last Thursday, floating in the Adriatic, more than 280 miles from where the trimaran was picked up by a Russian cargo ship.

There was no sign of the other sailor.

Mr Bamford was taken to the nearest major port, Durres in Albania.

An autopsy has been carried out in the Albanian capital, Tirana, and relatives are hoping to repatriate the body.

The seven week search involved not only the Italian and Greek authorities but also Interpol, police forces in Britain and the coastguard of almost every country around the Mediterranean.

Boats and planes had scanned the Med for weeks trying to trace the trimaran, and its two man crew - skipper Mr Bamford and an unnamed friend.

Mrs Morgan, 65, from Brosdale Drive, Hinckley, had raised the alarm when the pair did not turn up to meet her as arranged in Sicily.

She had travelled in a self-converted camper van, with pet dog Teddy, down to Syracuse and was expecting to join up with Mr Bamford sometime around October 10.

Mrs Morgan said: 'I last spoke to Mark on a mobile on October 5.He had just left Methoni in southern Greece in the trimaran and was sailing across to Syracuse.

'He said everything was fine and the weather was lovely. It's about a 450 mile journey and it would take a sailing boat on average five days so when a week had passed and they had not arrived I started to get worried.'

Mrs Morgan, a grandmother of two, alerted the coastguard and by October 15 a full search and rescue operation was underway.

She stayed in Sicily for three weeks, hoping for news but eventually decided to return home.

On November 8 in Calais while waiting for the next day's ferry back to England she received a phone call saying the wrecked red and white trimaran had been found by a Russian cargo vessel, partially submerged near to Paxos, the smallest Greek island in the Ionian Sea.

Both outer hulls had been ripped off, the wheel and mast were gone, puncture holes dotted the central hull and the rope was wrapped around the propeller.

'It was still a shock and I burst into tears,' said Mrs Morgan.

'From the damage reported I did doubt whether Mark was still alive. But I did still hold out hope.

'Then last Friday I had a visit from the police who told me Mark's body had been found off the coast of Albania.

'I think the reality of it only hit me then. To be honest I was not expecting him to be found but I am pleased that it was because it is closure.

'I just can't believe I will never see him again. We had some wonderful times on that boat and Mark was such an experienced sailor, what has happened seems unbelievable.'

The couple met at Stoney Cove around 10 years ago after Mr Bamford, took up diving.

A widow, Mrs Morgan said she was immediately intrigued and soon became smitten with this larger than life character.

'He was like no one else I'd ever met, very courageous, very strong and forceful. He was adventurous, he loved life, he loved travel and he loved sailing.

'He was originally from London and his family owned a large wooden skiff which they all used to holiday on. He learned to sail on that and from then always had a love of boats.

'He had a number of river boats and two sail boats before buying the Pulau Liga about 11 years ago.

'There were only three of her kind made and she was designed as a racing yacht.'

The couple lived together in Brosdale Road, latterly spending more than half the year abroad, sailing around the Mediterranean, first Spain and Portugal then Greece, leaving the boat when they returned home.

They had planned to begin exploring Sicily when Mr Bamford and the trimaran disappeared.
