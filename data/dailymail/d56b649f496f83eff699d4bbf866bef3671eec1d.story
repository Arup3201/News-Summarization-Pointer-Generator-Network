More than a thousand miles away from the nearest nation, at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, lies a ghostly graveyard of ships and aircraft sunk in the height of the Second World War.

More than 40 Japanese ships and 250 aircraft have their final resting place at the bottom of the Truk Lagoon, 1,118miles from Micronesia, making it the largest of its kind.

The vessels and airplanes went down during a two-day attack by the Allied forces known as Operation Hailstone, on February 16-17, 1944, destroying cruisers, auxiliaries and merchant ships which severely injured Japan's presence in the Pacific.

During the war, which ended seventy years ago, the Japanese used the surrounding islands of the Truk Lagoon - now known as Chuuk - as a base against the Allied forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. 

Seventy-one years later the underwater grave is a popular site for divers as fish invade the decayed war wreckage.

Nick Blake, 49, from Woking, visited the site in May last year as turtles swam among the debris.

He said: 'Dives were typically about one hour, sometimes a little longer on the shallower wrecks. We would typically do three days per day and I clocked up over 30 dives during my trip.

'Whilst I had gone to Truk fully prepared to photograph wrecks, what surprised me was the diversity of subject matter on each wreck site. As well as the wreck itself and the fascinating contents of the holds, they are festooned in coral, which makes for some fantastic photo opportunities.

'Without a doubt this stunning destination, with almost 70 charted wrecks, is truly the world's wreck capital - particularly in view of the sheer number of wrecks, their preservation and stunning condition.'
