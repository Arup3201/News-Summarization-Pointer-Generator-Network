Louis van Gaal has been named coach of the year in Holland after leading his country to the semi-finals of last summer's World Cup in Brazil.

The Manchester United boss, who left his job with the national side to take over at Old Trafford, picked up his award at the Dutch Sports Gala in Amsterdam on Tuesday night.

Van Gaal masterminded Holland's run to the last four in South America where they were defeated by Argentina on penalties. They then beat hosts Brazil 3-0 to secure third place.

The 63-year-old, who was previously Holland boss between 2000 and 2002, moved to the Premier League for the first time in July with Guus Hiddink taking over the Oranje.

The ex-Bayern Munich and Barcelona boss was not the only United employee to come away with an award as Robin van Persie was also honoured.

The striker earned the Dutch sports moment of the year gong for his brilliant, looped header in Holland's 5-1 thrashing of Spain in their opening World Cup group game.

Van Persie received his award from former Ajax defender Danny Blind, while his international team-mates Daley Blind and Jasper Cillessen were also on stage.

And there was more recognition for a member of Holland's World Cup squad as Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben was named Sportsman of the Year.

The former Chelsea and Real Madrid star was unable to attend the ceremony as he was busy scoring in Bayern's 2-0 Bundesliga win against Freiburg.

But he appeared on a big screen clutching the latest addition to his personal trophy cabinet to deliver an acceptance speech to those in attendance.

Another award winner in Amsterdam was 17-year-old Max Verstappen, who will drive for Formula One team Toro Rosso from the start of next season.

Verstappen, who was handed the young talent award, tweeted: 'Happy to have won the young talent award! That puts a crown on top of our work this year! Just a shame about the connection #Sportgala2014'

Speed skater Ireen Wust was named sportswoman of the year after winning two gold medals and three silver medals at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi earlier this year.
