West Bromwich Albion Under 21 coach James Shan was in the Meadow Lane crowd as Notts County drew with Scunthorpe on Saturday.

Shan is one of the names in the frame to succeed Shaun Derry as manager of the struggling League One side. 

Former Tottenham coach Ricardo Moniz, 50, who worked alongside Martin Jol, has emerged as the surprise favourite after caretaker Paul Hart said he only wanted the job for one game.

Notts County are only outside the bottom four in League One on goal difference, but have a game in hand

Derry took charge of Notts County in November 2013, registering himself as a player the following summer. 

After initially impressing, County struggled under his stewardship this season and currently find themselves hovering just above the League One drop zone.

They have lost six of their last 10 games, and are only outside the bottom four on goal difference.
