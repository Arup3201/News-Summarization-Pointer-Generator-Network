Keith Whyte, 33, battled temperatures of -26C, ferocious winds and frostbite to win the 100km ultra marathon in Antarctica

He battled temperatures of -26C, ferocious winds and frostbite to win the 100km Ice Marathon in Antarctica in just nine hours and 26 minutes – two hours quicker than the previous record holder.

And father-of-two Keith Whyte, 33, who suffers from bone condition osteoporosis, has now spoken of how close he came to losing his fingers during the gruelling race after the cold started to set in.

'I wanted to bite my fingers just to get the feeling back,' said the runner from County Clare, Ireland, who only quit smoking in 2007. 

'I could feel the frostbite setting in. At the next station we poured warm water on it and after a few minutes the feeling came back into the fingers. But I lost the glove. 

'If the station had been further away, it could have been more serious. Thankfully we found a replacement glove and I was able to continue.

'Any part of your skin exposed was in danger. I was lucky in that the worst injury I got during the race was very bad windburn on my face.' 

He finished the race on Union Glacier four hours ahead of his closest competitor, Kevin McGeeney, despite only signing up at the last minute. 

Speaking after his win, Mr Whyte said: 'It was an amazing once in a lifetime experience. The scenery is out of this world.' 

The marathon runner had only been back from injury for one week before taking on the mammoth challenge.

He suffered a stress fracture in his hip after the 100km World Championships in Doha in November last year.

This was brought on by his osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.

The father-of-two, who suffers from bone condition osteoporosis, said he was close to losing his fingers to frostbite during the gruelling race

In 2012 Keith won the British and Irish Championships, along with ultra-marathons in Dingle and Longford, Ireland.

As a result of his victories, he was  ranked number one for fifty miles in Europe and number two in the world.

Despite his experience, he admitted before the race: 'I don't know how you can prepare for something like this because it will be minus 30, minus 34 degrees,' he admitted before the race.

'It will be running on snow and then wearing so many layers, when I'd be just used to wearing shorts and a singlet.' 

Runners have been known to prepare for the freezing temperatures by running on treadmills in giant industrial freezers.

Advice on the website for the race said: 'Having some prior experience of running on ice / snow terrain in temperatures of -25C with your polar clothing would obviously be advantageous, but probably not practical for people who live in more temperate climates.

'As a result, some competitors have come up with innovative means of preparing for the race. These methodologies have ranged from running on beach sand to running on treadmills in freezers.'
