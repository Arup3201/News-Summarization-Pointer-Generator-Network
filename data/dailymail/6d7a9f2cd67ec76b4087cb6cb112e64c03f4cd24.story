Eugenie Bouchard is the new sweetheart of SW19, and with the biggest names in the women’s game falling quicker than sales of Saltires outside Wimbledon station, she is taking centre stage.

The Canadian swats away opponents with a firecracker forehand on the court and charms away from the lawns with a ready wit on subjects ranging from the Royal Family to what makes her blood boil.

The two collided on Wednesday when she was forced to wait for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge before taking apart quarter-final opponent Angelique Kerber.

‘When we walked out of the  members’ locker room five minutes before we were due to start, all these security guards rushed over to us and were, like, “Nobody move, move your bags to the side, there’s some Royals coming through”. So we were just waiting, and then suddenly  William and Kate walk by to go on Centre Court,’ she recounted.

‘It was funny because we actually walked to our court late because Kate and William used that hallway.  It’s funny how Wimbledon does it. Waiting for people usually makes me angry as I’m an impatient person —particularly when I’m waiting for family members for dinner — but I was OK to wait that one time.’

There are not many people  to whom Bouchard is happy to play second fiddle, as Kerber soon discovered.

With their blonde hair in neat plaits and both wearing matching white visors, it was as though they had co-ordinated their outfits. But when it came down to business, Bouchard smashed her mirror image, leaping on to the German’s woefully weak second serve and putting away overhead volleys like a prize fighter delivering a knockout punch.

The 20-year-old Canadian is no flash in the pan. Her relatively straightforward 6-3, 6-4 victory over Kerber, No 9 in the world and a former semi-finalist here, takes her into the top 10 for the first time.

Bouchard is the only player to reach the semi-finals of all three Grand Slams this year and No 3 seed Simona Halep today stands in the way of a spot in Saturday’s final. They are the two most consistent players on the women’s tour with 15 wins at this year’s majors.

Halep crushed Sabine Lisicki, last year’s beaten finalist, 6-4, 6-0 on Centre Court, partly owing to the German’s incredible implosion. Lisicki fell apart from 4-1 up in the first set, losing 11 games in a row. Halep smelt blood and ripped her to shreds. Bouchard has fallen at this hurdle in the Australian Open and Roland Garros but is determined to go further this time. As evidence of her determination, she has eschewed sightseeing trips with her mother Julie Leclair and brother William.

‘I don’t want to waste energy and get distracted,’ she said. ‘My mum and brother have gone visiting quite a bit. They went to Windsor Castle, the Parliament, all these things, while I’m practising or playing matches. Maybe I’ll do that after the tournament or next year. It’s something I do when I lose early, so I hope to not do it at all.’

Bouchard was named after  Princess Eugenie, and her twin  sister, who was named after  Princess Beatrice, attends university in Canada.

‘She is my own Princess Beatrice,’ said Bouchard. ‘We are opposite but very close. It’s interesting, because I think her normal university life is really cool because I don’t do it and I’m a huge  supporter of her. I get on her about her grades and things like that.’

If Bouchard was being assessed at Wimbledon, she would be  getting straight As so far. While her one-time idol Maria Sharapova and world No 1 Serena Williams have fallen by the wayside,  Bouchard is yet to drop a set.

Just two years ago she was  winning the junior girls’ title here and this is only her sixth Grand Slam, but it is indicative of her self-belief that she is not really  surprised at her surge up the rankings.

‘I felt last year that I belonged here so I don’t think it is surprising,’ she said. ‘I’ve played for 15 years now. I’ve put in a lot of hard work. So, results that come for me, in the back of my mind I expected them because I’ve put in so much time and effort.

‘I decided I was going to be a professional player at nine years old and the more I played I really had concrete dreams of winning a Grand Slam.’

Bouchard quickly dismissed a light-hearted suggestion that she might follow Greg Rusedski in switching allegiance from Canada to England, but the flag sellers outside the station might consider stocking more Maple Leaf flags for the remainder of the tournament.
