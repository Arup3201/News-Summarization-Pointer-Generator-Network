John Correia is a senior pastor at the West Greenway Bible Church in Glendale Arizona and also a fully qualified National Rifle Association firearms instructor. 

The father-of-four normally has a bible in one hand and an AR-15 assault rifle in the other while spreading the word of the lord. 

Correia lives with his wife Laura, 38, and his four children Phoenix, 17, James, 15, Sarah, 12 and eight-year-old Abby in Phoenix, Arizona. 

Former US Naval officer John Correia believes that Jesus wants him to preach using both his Bible and an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle at his Arizona church

Of the four children, eldest daughter Phoenix has no interest in firearms. But her younger brother James is an NRA apprentice instructor. He owns his own Browning BLR hunting rifles, a Remington 870 20 gauge shogun, several .22LR rifles and a Kahr CW9 pistol. 

Sarah, 12, is the proud owner of a shotgun, while 8-year-old Abby received a pink Crickett .22 single shot rifle for her birthday. 

Correia, who is a former US Navy officer has his own personal arsenal consisting of more than 20 weapons. The evangelical Christian owns three break-action shotguns, a Glock 19 handgun as well as an AR-15 rifle. 

The AR-15 rifle is the 'civilian' version of the M16 assault rifle used during the Vietnam war. The AR-15, however, does not have a fully-automatic fire setting, despite this, it was able to kill effectively in the Sandy Hook and Colorado theatre massacres.

Correia said: 'A guided tour of the different firearms that I own, that would take a while.

'A running joke is if you know how many firearms you own, you probably don't own enough.'

As well as a pastor, Correia is also a fully qualified firearms instructor with the National Rifle Association and enjoys passing his knowledge onto his family at the range

John, left, with daughter Sarah, said the only way he would ever willingly give up his firearms was if Jesus personally told him to do so

And despite the Bible's 'turn the other cheek' message, the 38-year-old pastor says scripture clearly justifies the use of lethal force.

John said: 'What fuels my passion for guns and self defense? First and foremost my Christian faith.

'I wish everyone got along, I wish that everybody was nice, but they're not. And until we get into that perfect world where Jesus comes again, we need to be able to protect ourselves and in Luke 22:36 I believe Jesus said "let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one".

'People ask me all the time, well what about peace on Earth and goodwill to all men? Absolutely true, I believe very strongly in what Paul says in chapter 12, verse 18 - he says if possible as far as it depends on you be at peace with all people, and I'm a peace lover, I'm friendly if you meet me.

'But you know what? There are some people who won't be at peace with you.'

And while the former Naval officer's message may be controversial, his views go down well with his congregation.

But as his wife Laura acknowledges, his love of guns has not been to the taste of all his fellow worshippers.

The trainee midwife said: 'If they are against guns, very against guns, they're probably not going to stay at our church for a long time. I will just honestly tell you that.

'And there have been some people that have left because they don't like his stance on guns, they don't like it being brought up in church, they don't like the fact that he'd go out to shoot with fellow members of the church.'

Members of John's church have left his congregation because of his views on the use of firearms and the fact that he will go shooting with some of his flock  

As well as preaching in church, Correia runs a popular Females with Firearms Facebook page and believes that women should be taught how to shoot properly 

Correia claims that while is in favour of 'Peace be with You' he acknowledges that not everyone is peaceful and it is necessary to be well prepared just in case

Alongside his Active Self Protection website, the preacher runs the popular Females With Firearms Facebook page and is a big advocate of women learning how to shoot.

'Listen, I'm a martial artist, I have a teaching rank in a derivative of Kempo and I know that I am big enough that somebody who is 100lbs, I can bum rush you, I can get through your martial arts, pin you to the ground and beat you to death,' he said.

'I know I can, but you know what I can't do? If you've got a firearm, I can't get past that. That's a force multiplying tool, especially if we have distance, so I think that's why females especially should be taught self-defence, especially with the use of firearms, because they're effective.'

Surprisingly, Correia and his wife were raised in San Fransisco Bay area in California, which has fairly draconian firearms laws compared with Arizona. 

She said: 'I was extremely afraid of guns going into my teenage years, to the point that this sporting goods store I worked at when I was a teenager, I would not even touch the guns, I wouldn't bring them out to show anyone.'

However, after her husband decided to buy a weapon for home defense, Laura resolved to conquer her fears and learn how to handle firearms properly.

She added: 'Now I feel very competent, I feel safe, I feel powerful, not in a "ha-ha, look at me I can shoot this gun and nobody can mess with me" way, but in a more protective, feel powerful against somebody that might try and hurt me sense.'

Abby, 8, holds her pink Crickett .22 rifle said 'I like shooting because it is fun. My friends at school think guns are really dangerous and we should never own a gun' 

The Correia family with some of their arsenal of more than 20 firearms. According to the Pastor, if you know exactly how many guns you own, you don't have enough

According to Correia, if the President Obama attempted to take away his firearms by removing the Second Amendment, 'that would cease to be a legitimate government'

And John and his children regularly head out on hunting trips or to the gun range for a spot of target practice.

Eight-year-old Abby said: 'I like shooting guns because it's fun.

'My friends at school think guns are really dangerous and you should never own a gun. I think that it's okay to own a gun as long as you know how to use it and when it's okay to use it and where it's okay to use it.'

While high school shootings like Sandy Hook have created a backlash against gun ownership in parts of the States, they have made the pastor even more determined to pass on his gun skills to his young family.

He said: 'If you look at the murderer, the rampage that happened at Sandy Hook, that young man murdered his mother to steal her firearms, to then transport them in the cause of a felony, which was another felony, took them on a school campus.

'He murdered 25 more people - and when did he stop? He stopped when the police cars pulled up, he took his own life because good men with guns were there to stop him, and as soon as they were, he stopped.

'A rifle in the hands of a good man is good, a rifle in the hands of an evil man is evil. So what does God think of guns? It's just a tool.'

Correia regularly takes members of his family on hunting trips using some of the wide array of firearms which he currently owns 

He said: 'I wish that everybody was nice, but they're not. And until we get into that perfect world where Jesus comes again, we need to be able to protect ourselves'

The couple both have a concealed carry permit, but the couple carefully restricts their children's access to firearms and only lets them use them under careful supervision - while all guns are technically owned by John.

He added: 'The firearms in my house have about as much appeal and mystique to my children as the mop in the kitchen. It's not something that's taboo, it's not something that's off-limits.'

Unsurprisingly, the preacher is a firm believer in the US Constitution's Second Amendment - the right to bear arms.

He said: 'How would I react if the state wanted to take away my firearms?

'I do believe that a government of the USA that tried to do that would cease to be a legitimate government.'

But with guns still firmly legal in Arizona, he will continue to spread his faith in God - and firearms - to his devoted flock.

'You can kind of get to be this caricature where people call me the Pistol Packing Preacher, or my ex-employees used to call me Minister Malice but my first and foremost commitment is to Jesus Christ,' he added.

'If you said John, Jesus came and said give up your firearms today and you can show me definitely it's Jesus, I'd give em up, because my commitment to Jesus comes first.

'But I don't think he does, I think he says "John, you're a bearer of the image of God, so protect that. Protect it in smart ways", and firearms today are the best way to do that.' 

He said: 'You can kind of get to be this caricature where people call me the Pistol Packing Preacher, or my ex-employees used to call me Minister Malice'
