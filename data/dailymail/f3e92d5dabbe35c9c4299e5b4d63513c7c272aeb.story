More than three decades after the deadly eruption of Mt St Helens in Washington state, an undeveloped roll of film resurfaced at a local newspaper containing never before seen images of the volcano on the eve of the deadly blast.

The rare prints were discovered by a staffer at The Columbian. They were taken in 1980 by newspaper photographer Reid Blackburn, who perished while covering the eruption just weeks later.

The black-and-white images showing the cauldron of the volcano belching out clouds of thick black smoke were captured by Blackburn from a helicopter in April.

Discovery: This photo of a simmering Mount St. Helens was taken five weeks before the May 1980 eruption by The Columbian photographer Reid Blackburn, but it was never developed and forgotten until this year

Forgotten: Blackburn shot the photos from a helicopter during a flyover, but when he got back, he put the roll of film aside without processing it

Five weeks later, on the morning of May 18, 1980, the conical summit of Mt St Helens towering 9,600 feet above sea level burst open following an earthquake.

Tragic death: Photojournalist Reid Blackburn, 27, was among the 57 people who perished in the blast

Within minutes, the north face of the symmetrical peak collapsed, spewing volcanic ash and unleashing rivers of hot  mud and scorching pumice that obliterated everything in their path.

The violent eruption lasted nine hours, causing catastrophic damage to the surrounding area and claiming 57 lives - among them The Columbian photojournalist Reid Blackburn.

Blackburn, 27, was at Coldwater Camp when the explosion happened. His body was discovered four days later inside his car, which was buried up to the windows in ash.

With the turmoil following the eruption, the deadliest of its kind in U.S. history, most people at the newspaper forgot about Blackburn's trip to the volcano five weeks prior.

When he returned from the flyover in April, the young photojournalist set aside the roll of film he shot depicting the smoking conical summit.

The undeveloped pictures had lingered in a film canister until the newspaper’s photo assistant Linda Lutes came upon it while going through a studio storage box in search of other images.

The stunning discovery of the 
long-lost prints came about after Lutes had received a request from a 
geology book author asking her to find a certain photo from the day of 
the eruption. 

The 
staffer was unable to track down the print in question, but she did 
stumble upon some of Blackburn's old negatives - and among them the 
undeveloped roll of film.

Caught by surprise: Blackburn's body was found four days later inside his car buried in several feet of volcanic ash

Catastrophe: The powerful blast sheared off the mountain's summit, sending piles of ash and rock into the air

When the historic black-and-white prints were finally processed, everyone at the paper was stunned to see Mt St Helens the way it looked 33 years ago, with its summit intact.  

Blackburn's widow, Fay, who still works for The Columbian, told the station KGW she was elated to discover one more piece of her late husband's legacy.
