Thousands of Yazidis are still trapped on Mount Sinjar, almost completely surrounded by ISIS who lurk at the bottom of the ridge in northern Iraq.

As ISIS cornered 50,000 Yazidis atop the mountain back in August, threatening them with genocide and the rape of their women, President Barack Obama ordered U.S. airstrikes on the Islamic extremists while the UK dropped aid to those in need.

But just four months later, the world has moved on, forgetting about the plight of the 8,000 men, women and children who are still trapped on Mount Sinjar, with just a handful rescued in the last few weeks.

The Iraqi air force continues to rescue Yazidis by the handful, but as many as 8,000 are said to still be trapped on top of Mount Sinjar

Despite U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes, ISIS militants still control the foot of the mountain, except in the western village of Bara where government forces are reported to be back in control.

Syrian-Kurdish fighters had kept a corridor open next to the 45-mile ridge, allowing Yazidis to flee to safety, but an ISIS offensive re-captured the escape route.

While ISIS are kept at bay for the time being, may fear the few Iraqi aid supply drops that can get through to the Yazidis may not be enough to see them through the cold of winter.

The only chance for the trapped Yazidis to escape is via helicopters from the Iraqi Air Force, which has been able to rescue many from Mount Sinjar, dropping them at a UN refugee camp in Faysh Khabur, on the Syrian border. 

Since the extremists' attack in August, 5,000 Yazidis have been killed on Mount Sinjar, with a further 7,000 women and girls kept as sex slaves.

Just four months after U.S. airstrikes stopped ISIS committing a horrific genocide on the Yazidis, the militants are closing in again

Although a well publicised exodus of Yazidi refugees took place from Mount Sinjar in August 2014 many still remain on top of the 45-mile long ridge-line

Despite efforts to stop the ISIS offensive, 5,000 Yazidis are said to have died on Mount Sinjar with thousands more women captured

Some of the killings were brutally simplistic, with people lined up at checkpoints, shot dead, then bulldozed into mass graves. Others were herded into temples which were later blown up.

UN researchers said hundreds more men had been killed for refusing to convert to Islam.

Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled into the Sinjar Mountains after the militant onslaught on Sinjar, part of ISIS' lightning advance into north and western Iraq.

Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said at the time that hundreds of women were abducted by the militants, who consider the Yazidis, a centuries-old religious minority, a heretical sect. 

Human Rights Watch said ISIS 'separated young women and teenage girls from their families and has forced some of them to marry its fighters'.

One woman told the organisation that she saw Islamic State fighters buying girls, and a teenage girl said a fighter bought her for $1,000.

ISIS cornered 50,000 in August but U.S. airstrikes held them off while Iraqi forces secured most Yazidis' rescue

But four months on, they are long-forgotten and the Islamic extremists are closing in on them once more

A handful of those trapped have been helicoptered to UN refugee camps but others rely on aid drops to survive
