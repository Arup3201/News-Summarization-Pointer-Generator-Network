You're more likely to have heard of David Beckham and Angelina Jolie than Jim Chapman or Zoella, but these YouTube vloggers are now more popular role models for young people than reality TV stars, Hollywood actors or footballers, according to research.

When asked, almost 40 per cent of 16-25 year olds said they would prefer to follow in the footsteps of professional video bloggers than make a living from being a reality TV star (6 per cent) or even from a career such as law or politics (34 per cent).

Almost one in three young people are avid viewers and fans of YouTube vlogs, tuning in at least twice a week; with almost half of these admitting to watching their favourite YouTube stars over ten times a weekly.

Is he YOUR idol? Vlogger Alfie Deyes, who last week released his first book, is one of the YouTube vloggers that young people now aspire to emulate the success of

Young people think that being snapped in a national newspaper is no longer enough to classify someone as ‘famous’.

The digitally-savvy 'selfie generation' believe that the top indicator for fame now must include a huge social media presence, such as having over two million YouTube subscribers (55 per cent), or over half a million Twitter followers (37 per cent), found the survey by Tesco Mobile. 

And it seems that these youngsters have good reason to aspire to be YouTube stars. For the likes of Jim Chapman, Tanya Burr and Alfie Deyes, filming their daily musings and sharing them on YouTube has snowballed from an innocent hobby to a multi-million pound making machine.

So successful have certain vloggers become that they're set to take the world of literature, beauty and television by storm.  

Alfie Deyes, a 20-year-old Youtube personality, is case in point. The star from Brighton is the wholesome (and rather well groomed) face behind the PointlessBlog, a Youtube 'vlog' that documents his life.

He began creating his pioneering videos at the age of 15 with titles including 'Girls are confusing', often featuring YouTuber girlfriend Zoe Sugg (otherwise known as Zoella) and friends Marcus Butler and Caspar Lee.

The PointlessBlog celebrated its fifth anniversary in July 2014 and #5YearsOfPointlessBlog trended worldwide number #1 for 9.5 hours.

Popular: Alfie's videos have attracted over 3M subscribers and he is now looking to the print industry to extend his success

His book which he is calling 'a gift to his fans' takes on a similar premise to his videos encouraging readers to take on harmless 'pointless' tasks and 'challenges of nothingness' including baking a cake in a mug and creating a time capsule.  

The 20-year-old's vlog content seems to match it's namesake  but however mundane the content may seem it has attracted an army of followers.

Alfie currently has 5,380,000 YouTube subscribers and his book seems to be going in the same direction.

The Pointless Book has already reached the top of the Amazon best-sellers list. 

According to the Telegraph, at his book signing at Waterstone's in London's Piccadilly Circus the popular vlogger was met by 8000 screaming fans. 

Alfie Deyes who is naturally flattered by the reaction says that he thinks that it is his down to earth attitude that has won him his fandom. 

'I think I'm just someone my viewers can relate to.'

Alfie is fast becoming a familiar face and is regularly approached by fans when he is out and about but for Alfie this is just one of the perks of the job.

He says of being mobbed by fans whenever he goes shopping: 'I love it! I just double the amount of time I would previously have allowed for the trip.'

Tanya Burr: 2.4m

Jim Chapman: 1.8m

Zoella: 6m

The 20-year-old has already seen his vlog take him to new and exciting places with some of the best perks including trips to America, Canada for Digifest US and Dubai. 

And this is only the beginning for the power player, who told this weekend's Observer that he would consider moving into the world of conventional, networked TV and radio - only as long as he was in control of the content. 

'Having creative control, as well as carrying out the whole process myself - shooting, editing and post-production - of all my videos is important,' he said. 'But I would not completely reject TV. If something were to come up where I had enough control and it was suitable for my fanbase, I would consider it.'

Big launch: The online launch of her bath range, which ranges in price from £4-£10, saw the social media sweetheart sell thousands of products in just minutes, with over ten per cent of shoppers logging on to the Zoella pages of the Superdrug website before it was even on sale

Gloss posse: So influential is Tanya that she created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes on sale in Superdrug. When the products went on sale exclusively on feelunique.com, they amassed the biggest waiting list the site has ever witnessed

Deyes isn't the only one making waves in the virtual world. His girlfriend Zoe Sugg, a.k.a Zoella, started her channel in 2009 to share her love of all things fashion and beauty. 

Today, aged 24, she has over 5.5m subscribers and millions of social media followers and last week launched her first ever beauty collection at Superdrug - and sales are already on track to make this the biggest brand launch of the year.  

The online launch of her bath range, which ranges in price from £4-£10, saw the social media sweetheart sell thousands of products in just minutes, with over ten per cent of shoppers logging on to the Zoella pages of the Superdrug website before it was even on sale.

From tomorrow, the collection will also be available exclusively at 102 Superdrug stores nationwide, and fans are expected to strip the shelves of the range of seven products, featuring images of her beloved guinea pigs Pippin and Percy.

A spokesperson for Superdrug said: 'YouTube and social media has introduced the world to a whole new type of star. These bloggers and vloggers invite viewers in to their homes and lives, building a rapport and sense of trust in a way we haven’t seen before.

'Beauty bloggers creating their own beauty ranges makes perfect sense, as shoppers trust their online idols to create products they would use themselves. At Superdrug we’ve been quick to tap into this trend and earlier this year launched an exclusive cosmetics range by Tanya Burr (2.5m YouTube subscribers) and our best-selling brand of make-up brushes Real Techniques has been created by the PixiWoo sisters (1.6m YouTube subscribers).'

To celebrate the launch of her new range, Zoella will be meeting fans in Superdrug later this month. 

Brit favourite Tanya Burr accumulates 10m views per month on her channel, has almost 2m subscribers and nearly a million Twitter followers.

So influential is Tanya that she has created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes on sale in Superdrug. When the products went on sale exclusively on feelunique.com, they amassed the biggest waiting list the site has ever witnessed.

Speaking to MailOnline about her success, the 24-year-old said: 'I'm not entirely sure how my YouTube channel has become such a success, but I think it could be to do with my positive, friendly personality. 

'I think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as I'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable, I'm still just a normal girl despite my large following.

'People say that when they watch my videos thy feel like I'm their friend and I love that. When I meet fans in the street I always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely!

'I think the world of YouTube is amazing in that you can feel like you're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video. It's also incredible in that, if it wasn't for my YouTube channel, I wouldn't have started my own makeup line.

Party girl: Tanya Burr walks all the big red carpet and hit showbiz's biggest events, such as the TV Baftas

'I couldn't have done it without the support of my fans. I spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way. I started with these products as I feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots.

'I love the colours I designed so much and I named them after all of my favourite things and places. For example, I got engaged in New York so I named one of the darker polishes New York Night and I love picnics so I named my favourite pretty pink gloss Picnic In The Park.'

Tanya, who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the London social circuit, is already planning her next range of beauty products, which are likely to have similar success.

As well as adding eight new lip gloss colours to her range next week, at the end of October, she will be launching something totally new that's 'top secret', she tells MailOnline. 

Her fiance Jim Chapmam, whose sisters are the brains behind the amazing Real Techniques cosmetic brush brand, is also seeing his star rise. 

He just signed a modelling contract with esteemed agency, Model 1, and is a presenter on Simon Cowell's syco Youtube channel.
