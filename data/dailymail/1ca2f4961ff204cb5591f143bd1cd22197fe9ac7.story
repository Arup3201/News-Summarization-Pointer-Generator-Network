Locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate, prosecutors have told the bail hearing of accused murderer Gable Tostee in the Brisbane Supreme Court.

Lawyers for Tostee, the 28-year-old carpet layer charged with murdering New Zealand woman, Ms Wright, on the Gold Coast in August are applying to have him freed on bail.

They have told the court Tostee would give up alcohol and using the mobile dating app Tinder - on which he met Ms Wright - if freed on bail to await trial. 

Justice Debra Mullins, who has adjourned the hearing until Wednesday, has told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'.

Tostee's lawyers, from  Robertson O'Gorman, the Brisbane firm appointed by Tostee following his first bail hearing two months ago, have said in the hearing he is 'always on guard' against fellow inmates at the Athur Gorrie Correctional Centre, where he has been held since his arrest.

Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, fell to her death from the balcony of Tostee's 14th-floor luxury apartment at around 2.20am on August 8, hours following a night together after they met at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. 

Mr Tostee was arrested a week later.  Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman.

Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. 

The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him.

Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety.

Mr O'Gorman described as 'absolutely worrying' police claims in the affidavit filed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, which included that Mr Tostee and Ms Wright allegedly had a fight before she fell.

The police affidavit was among eleven documents filed for Gable Tostee's first bail application, before  Justice Debra Mullins, who adjourned the matter to give Mr Tostee's defence team more time.

Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death.

Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'.

Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died.

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

No medical files about Mr Tostee's alleged autism condition, nor any additional documents have yet been filed for Mr Tostee's new bail application.
