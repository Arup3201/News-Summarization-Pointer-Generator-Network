Despite the pride of Manchester being at stake, no local players were to be found in the matchday squad for the derby on Sunday.

The startling statistic is perhaps more common in modern football, and was based upon the 36 Manchester City and Manchester United players listed for the game at the Etihad Stadium.

There were only eight Englishmen in total with zero Mancunians, and six Argentines selected.

Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Sergio Aguero, Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria and Willy Caballero made up the contingent from Argentina, while Wayne Rooney was the most 'local' from either 18-man squad, having been raised in Liverpool.

Danny Welbeck was one player who were most renowned with representing Manchester in the derby, but has now have moved on.

United's Tyler Blackett is Manchester born and bred but was surprisingly overlooked for the game, something Louis van Gaal may have regretted after Chris Smalling's sending off.

Speaking before the game, Blackett told United's club website: As one of the more local lads, I know what this club means.' 

'Don't get me wrong, the foreign players know Manchester United as well but being a local lad gives you extra incentive to do well.'
