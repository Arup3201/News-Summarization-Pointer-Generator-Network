He's tasked with sampling the calorie-laden culinary delights on MasterChef week after week so really it should come as no surprise that John Torode might gain a few pounds here or there.

However, it seems that 48-year-old John has enjoyed a few too many taste tests over his time on the show, revealing that he thinks he'll have piled on a staggering stone by the end of the season.

Speaking on This Morning about the tenth series final, which will see cooks Jack, Luke and Ping battle it out for the title tonight and tomorrow, he said: 'I watch it now and think "I know that, at the end of the series, I'll be a stone heavier.'

'I saw myself on TV the other day and I've got this big fat belly in my chef's outfit and thought "God, you're unattractive",' he added.

His perceived weight gain is hardly surprising considering how much food he is tasked with sampling.

When asked how many plates of food he's eaten over the ten series, he replied: 'I reckon it's close to 10,000 because there was one series we did when we actually ate 2,490 plates of food in one series.'

And whn quizzed on how he attempts to keep the weight off, he told Phillip that he 'cycles like hell'.

Anyone who is a fan of Masterchef might have noticed that John's weight does seem to fluctuate a tad. Since 1999, when the show first began John has obviously got a little older and wiser and his body shape has changed here and there too.

Meanwhile, co-star Gregg Wallace, who once described himself as the ‘fat, bald bloke on MasterChef who likes pudding’, has lost two stone on his latest diet and become an ambassador for WeightWatchers as a result.

And perhaps it's not just John's judging duties that have lead to John's extra pounds. They say that being in a relationship leads to weight gain, so maybe John's girlfriend actress and chef Lisa Faulkner is partly to blame?

Faulkner has described her relationship with Torode, which blossomed after the pair pair met on celebrity Masterchef in 2010 and split from their former partners, as 'really new, really lovely'.

She told the Mail last September: 'John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...

Is being in a relationship to blame? The chef was granted a divorce from his wife Jessica in February, clearing the way for his romance with actress Lisa Faulkner, right

'I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different.

'I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.'

Faulkner's ex-husband Chris Hoghill, who played Tony King in EastEnders, moved out of their marital home in early 2012. The pair share custody of an adopted daughter, Billie, who is six.

Torode has four children, two with his ex-wife Jessica and another two from a previous relationship.

Lisa has previously insisted that there were no sparks between her and Torode when they first met filming Celebrity Masterchef.

'When I met John he was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,' she said.

'All I could think was, “That sauce hasn't worked.” I didn't see anything but food for three months.

'After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.'

Since first going public with their romance in November 2012, Faulkner and Torode have not sought to downplay their romance, but neither have they exactly flaunted it.

They have been photographed together at celebrity events just a few times and both still live at separate London addresses.

Faulkner began acting at 19 in the film The Lover after leaving school at 16 to model. Roles in Brookside, Holby City and Spooks followed.

Since taking the MasterChef crown she has reinvented herself as a cookery expert, publishing two recipe books, the second of which features her daughter throughout.

'Cooking anchors me and calms me,' she has said.

That makes her an ideal match for Torode, who began his kitchen career in his home town, Melbourne, aged 16 before moving to London in 1991 and clinching jobs as sous chef at some of London's most fashionable restaurants.

After first appearing on television in 1996 on ITV1's This Morning, he joined Greg Wallace to present a revamped MasterChef on BBC One in 2005.

And it seems that his waistline looks set to expand even more. He has just returned from a road trip for his new television series, John Torode’s Australia, which sees him eating his way across his native country.

Back to his roots: John Torode cooks on Sydney's harbour with the iconic opera house in the background

Over 10 episodes, he will revisit childhood haunts, along with the people and places that influenced his cooking and inspired him to become a professional chef.

His foodie trail covers five states - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania – as the presenter catches up with family and friends and recreates some of his favourite Aussie dishes.

‘It was a tremendous adventure’, he says, ‘What’s important about this series is that it’s about me and my culinary journey - what shaped me to become what I am. It’s sort of like This Is Your Life in food.’

The series kicks off in Sydney, Australia’s biggest and most multi-cultural city, where Torode’s career as a chef took off.

After cooking some of his favourite Vietnamese dishes, exploring China Town and finding out more about the city’s Lebanese community, viewers will see him catch up with acclaimed Aussie chefs Neil Perry and Peter Gilmore at their respective restaurants, before firing up the grill for a Torode family reunion barbecue.
