Ever spotted that friend who constantly moans and complains about their life on Facebook?

Worryingly, research suggests that those who describe themselves as lonely or depressed are more likely to share personal information.

This includes details such as their favourite book or film to their relationship status and even their home address.

A study by researchers at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia suggests that users who describe themselves as 'lonely' or 'depressed' on Facebook are more likely to share detailed personal information than those who are considered 'connected'

In total 616 female Facebook users were profiled by scientists at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia.

Facebook came under fire last year for allowing teenagers to make public posts.

Before the update Facebook prevented under 18s making posts public; the widest audience they could reach was Friends of Friends.

In
 a blog post in October, Facebook said: 'Teens are among the savviest 
people using social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, 
activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard.

'So, starting today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on Facebook.'

According to the researchers, ‘half (308) were categorised as “connected” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as “lonely”; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting.’

The study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self-disclosure.

‘The results of this study have shown that more “lonely” people disclosed their personal information, relationship information and address than “connected” people,’ write the researchers.

In fact, a huge 98 per cent of the users who described themselves as lonely listed their relationship status publicly.

Some even shared their home address.

79 per cent of lonely users, meanwhile, disclosed other personal details such as their favourite film and book, compared to less than 65 per cent of connected users.

‘It makes sense that the people who felt lonely would disclose this type of information,’ co-author of the study Dr Yeslam Al-Saggaf tells Market Watch.

‘They want to make it easier for others to initiate contact with them, which may help them overcome their feelings of loneliness.’

There have been several previous studies linking Facebook with depression. In September 2013, for example, it was found that online social media contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life-satisfaction, rather than making us feel connected

This is just one of several studies linking Facebook with depression or loneliness.

In September 2013, a study from the University of Michigan psychologist Dr Ethan Cross showed how online social media, rather than making us feel connected, contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life-satisfaction.

According to the study, the technology is having a fundamentally negative effect on the way we interact with others, and the way we perceive ourselves.

The study's 82 participants were text messaged five times a day over a two-week period with a link to an online survey about their Facebook use, their feelings of well-being and the amount of face-to-face social interaction they had engaged in.

Kross and his team discovered that the more time participants had spent on Facebook, the less happy they felt over time.

'The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time,' reported the study.
