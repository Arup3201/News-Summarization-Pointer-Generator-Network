A fare-dodger who shot a rookie cop in both legs told a judge 'f*** it' when asked if he had anything to say before he was sentenced today.

Rashaun Robinson was given 25 years in prison for shooting James Li, who had graduated the New York City police academy just two months before he was shot in Brooklyn in February.

Before he was sentenced, 29-year-old Robinson had tried to withdraw his guilty plea, saying he had been given bad advice by his lawyer and had been on medication, the New York Post reported.

But Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Alan Marrus said he had no reason to do so.

Defiant: Robinson, pictured in February ahead of his arraignment, told a judge 'f*** it' when asked if he had anything to say at his sentencing. He previously lamented that the police officer was still able to walk

'This case demonstrates that a lawbreaker can be the one who overreacts in a confrontation with a police officer,' Marrus said, apparently referencing the incident in Ferguson earlier this summer.

'It's a stark example of the extreme danger a police officer faces.'

Robinson shot Li, 27, after the cop pulled him off a bus in Crown Heights, Brooklyn on February 26 for skipping his fare.

Two off-duty fire department  EMTs, Khadijah Hall and Shaun Alexander, ran to Li's side and gave him aid as they waited for the ambulance to arrive.

Li suffered nerve damage and now uses a cane and walks with a limp. He undergoes physical therapy a few times a week.

After his arrest, Robinson said he had wanted to kill a police officer that day and said he carried a gun because cops thought they ran everything.

'They are the biggest gang in New York and are always messing with black people and he is sick of it,' he said, according to court papers.

When Robinson pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in August, the judge asked him whether he was aware of the pain he had inflicted on Li.

He responded coldly: 'He can still walk.'

Following the sentencing on Wednesday, Li dismissed his assailant as 'dumb'.

'I'm just glad he's getting 25 [years],' the police officer told the Post.
