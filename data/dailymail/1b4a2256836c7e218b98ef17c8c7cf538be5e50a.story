The husband and work partner of a Japanese reporter who was killed in Syria has told how his wife was shot dead moments after they were ambushed by government troops.

Mika Yamamoto, 45, an award-winning journalist, was gunned down last month in the flashpoint city of Aleppo on her first day in the country.

Her husband, photographer Kazutaka Sato, who was with her at the time, described how they fled in panic after the soldiers opened fire.

Kazutaka Sato has told of the horrifying moment his wife Mika Yamamoto was shot dead after they were ambushed by government forces while on assignment in Syria

Mr Sato, 56, said he saw 10 to 15 men walking towards them who he assumed were members of the Free Syrian Army, who had been accompanying them.

He told CBS news: 'I held up my camera and started shooting. It was then that it happened.

'I thought I was going to be hit and that's when I was separated from Mika. At no point did I think that she had died.

'I asked a rebel fighter where Mika was. He told me, "She's at the hospital, go and see for yourself." 'At that point I pretty much imagined what had happened to her.

'On the first floor of the hospital, in 
the lobby to the left on a stretcher, I saw a body wrapped in a sheet. 
And I knew then it was Mika.'

Mr Sato is seen on the streets of Aleppo in footage taken on the day his wife was shot. He spent an hour trying to find her before learning she had been killed

Mika Yamamoto, was an experienced and award-wining reporter, who had worked in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans and Mr Sato spoke of her dedication to the job.

He added: 'I think it was her firm belief that you can stop a war with journalism ... she would also turn her attention to children.

'I believe she wanted to tell the world how they are hurt, dead and bruised in their hearts.'

Mr Sato said the only way he believes he can come to terms with what happened is to find out exactly what happened.

Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo
 after he accompanied her body home from Syria he said: 'I suspect the 
government side is afraid to see Western journalists, including us, 
report facts.'

'What they fear most is a camera,'

Mr Sato spoke of his wife's belief in the power of  journalism and how she would often turn her attention to the plight of children caught up in warzones

Earlier in the day, Sato visited the Syrian embassy in Tokyo and handed over a letter requesting a thorough investigation of the case.

In the letter, Sato said: 'If your country shoots journalists who report things it finds unfavourable, it is an outrageous act threatening the freedom of the press, which can never be forgiven internationally.'

Sato said the Syrian embassy official who received the letter told him the government was not responsible for the well-being of the two journalists because they had entered the country without the proper visas.

However, he undertook to pass the letter to Damascus.

Yamamoto's
 funeral was held in her hometown of Yamanashi, west of Tokyo, last 
week. An autopsy revealed she had been shot nine times, including in the
 neck where the bullet had fatally damaged her cervical spinal cord.

Yamamoto is the fourth foreign journalist to have been killed in Syria since March 2011 and the first to have died in Aleppo. She had covered several armed conflicts, including in Afghanistan and Iraq.

She became a well-known face on Japanese television after surviving a US tank shelling on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad in 2003 in which two journalists, one from Reuters and one from a Spanish broadcaster, were killed.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 26,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt began in March last year -- more than two-thirds of them civilians.
