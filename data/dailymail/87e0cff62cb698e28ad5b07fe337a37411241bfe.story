Astonishing: A survey commissioned by The Ramblers found a quarter of people walk for less than nine minutes a day - and that includes time spent getting to the car, to work and to the shops

Whether it's a stroll in the country or a trot around the block, going for a walk is generally seen as good exercise.

But almost half of us are not doing enough of it to stay healthy, researchers suggest.

And they claim that, astonishingly, a quarter of us walk for less than nine minutes a day, or under an hour a week on average â€“ and that includes time spent getting to the car, to work and to the shops.

That was despite the fact that an overwhelming majority, 93 per cent, of those questioned agreed that walking was a good form of exercise that can keep you healthy.

Health guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer recommend that adults do two-and-a-half hours a week of moderate physical activity, such as walking.

But 43 per cent of those asked said they walk for two hours or less a week.

The survey of 2,000 adults was commissioned by the Ramblers, formerly the Ramblers Association, to mark the start of Get Walking Week.

The Ramblers said that the results showed a 'pandemic of inactivity'. It is launching a campaign to get 100,000 more people going for regular strolls as part of their daily lives.

Chief executive Benedict Southworth said: 'We want people all over Britain to join
the walking revolution and take their first steps towards a healthier 
and happier lifestyle.

'Walking is one of the most accessible 
and achievable ways to conquer this inactivity pandemic in Britain, and 
we need to get started now.

Get Walking Week: The Ramblers said that the survey results showed a 'pandemic of inactivity'

'Find a short walk with your local 
Walking for Health scheme or Ramblers group during Get Walking Week and 
join us as we get Britain moving.'

Health spokesperson: Diane Abbott said the figures were 'worrying'

Medical experts have warned that life expectancies could fall because of a lack of walking.

William Bird, a GP who specialises in 
the benefits of exercise, said: 'We're going to find this generation 
will die earlier than their parents if they don't start doing basic 
movement.

'We all age quicker when we're not 
moving and the consequences of that are age-related diseases, such as 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.'

He added: 'A lot of doctors know very 
little at all about the importance of physical activity and it's at the 
bottom of their list, but if you got everyone walking it would have a 
massive effect on the health of the country.'

Diane Abbott, Labour's spokesperson for public health, said the figures were a 'worrying' indication of the nation's health.

She said: 'If the average person is so inactive then that means that most children aren't seeing adults being active, which will only contribute to the obesity epidemic.'

She added: 'We need to plan activity into the way buildings are designed. The first thing you see in a building is often a lift - then you have to look for the stairs. It should be the other way around.'
