A Southern California father and his girlfriend have been found guilty of torture and child abuse for starving two of his children and beating a third.

A San Bernardino County jury convicted 30-year-old Erik Austin Flores and 23-year-old Mariah Rita Sugg, of Hesperia, Wednesday.

Each faces 20 years to life in prison when they're sentenced January 8.

Prosecutors say the 4-year-old and 5-year-old children suffered permanent height loss because of their malnutrition and resembled concentration camp survivors and zombies when they were found and taken in by authorities earlier this year.

Their 7-year-old brother, who did not starve because he was fed breakfast and lunch at school, testified that Sugg would beat him and his siblings, make them do exercises for hours and make them stand in the corner for entire days.

According to a news release from the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office, Erik Flores’ children were removed from their custody June 6 by social workers acting on a tip from employees at the Marinello School of Beauty in Victorville.

The staff at the beauty school noticed that the couple’s kids looked emaciated when they were brought to the school on May 16, according to testimony.

The Good Samaritans compared two of Flores’ kids to ‘concentration camp’ survivors and ‘zombies,’ describing them as rail-thin and listless.

All the while, authorities say Flores and Sugg were receiving food stamps.

Dr. Mark Massi, a forensic pediatrician from Loma Linda University Medical Center, testified that both children suffered great bodily injury as a result of long-term starvation.

Flores’ 4-year-old daughter would have died soon had she not been hospitalized, Massi testified.

Both children suffered from a permanent loss of height as a result of starvation, according to Massi.

He also said the girl’s development was arrested as a result of starvation. At age 4, the girl could barely talk and was not toilet trained.

Prosecutors also argued that Flores had sexually abused the little girl in 2012 and 2014 based on injuries to her genitals caused by what Dr Massi described as blunt-force penetration.

The 30-year-old father of three was not charged with sexual assault of his daughter due to insufficient evidence.

Deputy District Attorney David Foy told the jury that Mariah Sugg made her boyfriend's 7-year-old son perform push-ups, sit-ups and run in place for hours, and if the child showed signs of slowing down, the woman would hit him in the head with a belt. 

The 7-year-old testified that Sugg only allowed him to eat small portions of food in between chores and endless exercise routines, reported the Victorville Daily Enterprise. 

According to Foy, Sugg would give the boy a small piece of a corn dog and then eat the rest of it herself.

On Wednesday, a jury panel found Flores and Sugg each guilty of three counts of torture and three counts of willful cruelty to a child with possibility of injury or death.

‘I am so grateful that the jury took care to find justice for these children,’ David Foy said.
