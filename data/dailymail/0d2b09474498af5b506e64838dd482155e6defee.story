Managers:  Joachin Low (Germany) and Paulo Bento (Portugal)

Key clash: Cristiano Ronaldo v Jerome Boateng

Boateng is expected to be placed out of position at right back in a makeshift German back four and will face the unenviable task of marking Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo, who Portugal channel most of their attacks through. If he can stand firm then Germany have the game as good as won – if not, we could be in for goals.One to watch: William Carvalho (Portugal)

Carvalho has been the standout player in Liga Sagres this season and has caught the attention of the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid. Owners Sporting Lisbon are demanding a huge fee for the midfielder but some good performances in Brazil might give one of the big clubs reason to test their resolve.Head-to-head record: Played 17 Germany wins 9 Draws 5 Portugal wins 3
