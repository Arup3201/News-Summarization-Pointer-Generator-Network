CCTV images capture the moment a public-spirited van driver pulls over for police motorcyclists - only to face punishment for straying into a bus lane.

Daniel Wiggins pulled in to allow five police motorcycle-riders to pass as he drove his Peugeot van through south-west London earlier this year.

But he was left stunned when he was later told he would have to pay a fine of more than £500 for driving in a bus lane.

His shock turned to anger when CCTV images sent to him showed his van only entered the restricted lane as the bikes passed him on his right-hand side.

The problem was made all the worse when he failed to receive the letter ordering him to pay the fine, meaning his vehicle was later clamped.

He was left facing a £512 fine to prevent bailiffs towing the vehicle, money he had wanted to spend on a holiday.

Mr Wiggins, of Surbition, south-west London, told The Sun: 'What was I supposed to do? Not let the police through? It's all a complete joke.'

Kingston council originally told Mr Wiggins he was too late to appeal, but finally agreed to refund the fine after the pictures were published yesterday.

Earlier this year, it emerged that drivers are now paying £135million a year to offences caught on spy cameras in bus lanes and box junctions.

Motoring organisations say the figures - up nearly 20 per cent on the previous year - show councils are targeting drivers to balance their budgets.

The CCTV cameras spot those guilty of straying into bus lanes, blocking box junctions or committing other infringements.

Penalties can be as high as £130 and only a tiny fraction are quashed on appeal.

Sarah Rice of the RAC said of the figures: 'It really does look as though motorists are being used to raise revenue for cash-strapped councils.

‘Cameras need to be set up fairly and signed clearly so that drivers are not unduly punished for minor errors just to generate more money for the authorities. Motorists are generally law abiding and want to obey the rules.'

London drivers bear the brunt of the fines and were penalised 850,000 times in 2012/13 compared with 797,000 the year before.

Another blunder saw driver Jonathan Palgrave, of Lincolnshire, fined £60 for driving in a bus lane in Sheffield, a city he has never visited.

The 32-year-old's kit car was accidentally mixed up with a council roadsweeper after authorities in the Yorkshire city confused a 'B' with an 'E'.
