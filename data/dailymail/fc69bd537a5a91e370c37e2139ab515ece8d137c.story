A New York Times editor has denied that an anonymous letter sent to the paper's magazine advice column over the summer is from the spurned husband of Gen David Petraeus' alleged mistress.

The possibility was raised after observers dug out the July 13 edition of Chuck Klosterman's 'The Ethicist' and pointed to extraordinary parallels between the letter and the now scandalous love tryst that led the general to hand in his resignation as details of the affair came to light.

But yesterday, the editor of the The New York Times magazine denied that the column and the Petraeus scandal are related.

Was the fact that Paula Broadwell (left) having an affair with David Petraeus known by her husband Scott (right) and did he write an anonymous letter to the New York Times advice column for help?

Denial: New York Times magazine editor Hugo Lindgren tweeted yesterday that the advice The Ethicist column in question was not from Scott Broadwell, the husband of alleged Petraeus mistress Paula Broadwell

Hugo Lindgren tweeted: 'This @theethicist column... is NOT about the Petraeus affair, based on our factchecking. Strange, I know'.

Writing about a deepening 
relationship he knew his wife was having with a 'government executive' 
whose job 'is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership' 
the anonymous man offers up what could be considered in hindsight as 
striking information.

The letter writer explains that 'exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort,' and asks 'The Ethicist' whether it is OK for him to 'suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project.'

Indeed, he seems pained to make it clear he believes the mission 'must succeed' and wants to know if he should confront his wife in some way and 'finally force closure' or if he should 'suffer in silence for the next year or two.'

The reader tells 'The Ethicist' that has
'watched the affair intensify over the last year' - which matches the 
timeline of the affair from August 2011 until about several months ago.

Slate writer Allison Benedikt asked, 'What government executive is not having an affair with some guy's wife?'

Another writer with the publication added, 'would anyone really repeatedly refer to heading the CIA as a 'project'? Doesn't sound quite right.'

Those supporting the belief that the letter came from Scott Broadwell, point to Klosterman's insightful reply to the anonymous man's dilemma.

He tells the letter writer that he should tell his wife he wanted to separate, 'just as you would if she were sleeping with the mailman.'

'Other woman': Paula Broadwell, left, is married
and has two children. Petraeus has been married to his wife Holly,

He claims there is no reason to reveal the affair in a public fashion, but having offered this clear-cut advice he goes slightly further.

'The fact that you’re willing to accept your wife’s infidelity for some greater political good is beyond honorable,' replied Klosterman on July 13 to the letter.

'In fact, it’s so over-the-top honorable that I’m not sure I believe your motives are real.

'Part of me wonders why you’re even posing this question, particularly in a column that is printed in The New York Times.

'I halfway suspect you’re writing this letter because you want specific people to read this column and deduce who is involved and what’s really going on behind closed doors (without actually addressing the conflict in person).

'That’s not ethical, either.'

'My wife is having an affair with a government executive. His role is to manage a project whose progress is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership. (This might seem hyperbolic, but it is not an exaggeration.)'I have met with him on several occasions, and he has been gracious. (I doubt if he is aware of my knowledge.) I have watched the affair intensify over the last year, and I have also benefited from his generosity.'He is engaged in work that I am passionate about and is absolutely the right person for the job. I strongly feel that exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort.'My issue: Should I acknowledge this affair and finally force closure? Should I suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project I feel must succeed?'Should I be “true to my heart” and walk away from the entire miserable situation and put the episode behind me?' NAME WITHHELD

The resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus has brought a sudden and unexpected end to the public career of a four-star general who led U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and was thought to be a potential candidate for president.

Petraeus admitted to an extramarital affair in tendering his resignation, which President Obama accepted on Friday.

The FBI discovered the relationship by monitoring Petraeus' emails, after being alerted that Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account and allegedly sent threatening emails to another woman whom she believed was also having an affair with Petraeus, officials said.

Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, 
has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was
a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.

CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell will serve as acting director, Obama said. Morell was the key CIA aide in the White House to President George W. Bush during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

'I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,' Obama said.

The resignation comes at a sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday.

The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world.

Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the assault on the consulate in Benghazi, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

 Barack Obama's national security policy has been compromised  by the loss of one of David Petraeus

Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, 
has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was
a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.

She was the daughter of the academy superintendent. They have two children, and their son led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan.

The retired general told his staffers in a statement that he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment' in engaging in the affair. 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.' He said he had offered his resignation to Obama on Thursday and the president accepted it Friday.

Administration officials said the White House was first notified about the Petraeus affair on Wednesday, the day after the election. Obama, who returned to the White House that evening after spending Election Day in Chicago, wasn't informed until Thursday morning.

For the director of the CIA, being engaged in an extramarital affair is considered a serious breach of security and a counterintelligence threat. If a foreign government had learned of the affair, the reasoning goes, Petraeus or Broadwell could have been blackmailed or otherwise compromised. Military justice considers conduct such as an extramarital affair to be possible grounds for court-martial.

Failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank and file that such behavior is acceptable.

Petraeus, who became CIA director in September 2011, was known as a shrewd thinker and hard-charging competitor. His management style was recently lauded in a Newsweek article by Broadwell.

The article listed Petraeus' 'rules for living.' No. 5 was: 'We all make mistakes. The key is to recognize them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear view mirrors—drive on and avoid making them again.'

The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Petraeus' departure represented 'the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants.

From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one's country.'

Other CIA directors have resigned under unflattering circumstances. CIA Director Jim Woolsey left over the discovery of a KGB mole, and director John Deutch left after the revelation that he had kept classified information on his home computer.

The New York Times denial begs the question: If not Petraeus, then who is the 'government executive' involved?
