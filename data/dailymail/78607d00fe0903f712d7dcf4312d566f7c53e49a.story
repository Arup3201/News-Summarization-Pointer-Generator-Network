One December night in 1942 a Nazi parachutist landed in a Cambridgeshire field. His mission: to sabotage the British war effort. His name was Eddie Chapman, a British bank robber recruited by the Germans, who would shortly become MI5's Agent Zigzag. Dashing and louche, courageous and unpredictable he was to be Britain's most sensational double agent and a man hailed as a hero by both sides.

Chapman has been the subject of films and TV documentaries yet little is known of his extraordinary wife Betty, a woman apparently able to cope with his affairs, criminal activities, separations and personal traumas.

During their 50-year marriage Eddie had serious relationships with no fewer than six mistresses. He lived with several of them and had a daughter out of wedlock but Betty lived an independent life when they were apart and was not short of admirers.

Mr and Mrs Zigzag: Eddie Chapman and Betty Farmer were married for 50 years

In her memoir Betty describes a marriage that was fraught but loving. 'She was never Eddie's victim,' says counsellor and therapist Lilian Verner-Bonds, a long-term friend of the Chapmans who contributed to the book.

'She had the same strength and steel as he did. That's why they were perfectly suited and she was able to give him the support she did.'

'There is no doubt she was his anchor and he wanted her involved in many of his ventures,' says their friend Ronald Bonewitz, who helped Betty, now 96 and living in a nursing home in the south of England, to produce her book. 'Eddie was like a torrent of water flowing around the rock that was Betty.'

Excitement: Betty initially turned down Eddie's offer of marriage but then realised 'life would be more interesting with him than without him'

Her first insight into his wild ways came in 1939 when Betty Farmer, as she then was, travelled to Jersey with the 25-year-old Chapman while he was on the run from Scotland Yard following crimes on the mainland (he had fled bail having been charged with blowing up the safe of the Edinburgh Co-operative Society). However she thought he was 'in films' and did not know about any of this.

'I was 22 and in love with the most handsome and charismatic man I had ever seen. I couldn't remember being happier,' she recalls of the man with whom she had been living for a little over three months. They were enjoying a lazy Sunday lunch at Jersey's Hotel de la Plage when Chapman saw an undercover policeman approaching him.

He leapt from his seat, kissed Betty's shoulder and made a spectacular exit by diving through the French windows (which were closed). He was arrested later that evening. It would be six years before Betty would see Eddie again but neither ever forgot the other.

'I wasn't going to have anything like a 'normal' married life but at the same time I found my life with him was exciting'

Eddie ended up serving time in Jersey. While he was incarcerated the Second World War broke out and Jersey was occupied by the Germans. Chapman volunteered his services to the Nazis as a spy, while intending all along to become a British double agent. Germany accepted his offer and named him Agent Fritzchen. They trained him in explosives, radio communications and parachuting before sending him to England in 1942 to commit acts of sabotage.

He immediately surrendered offering his services to MI5 - who faked an attack on his target, the de Havilland aircraft factory in Hertfordshire, on his behalf - before making his way back to his controllers who awarded him the Iron Cross for his work as a 'saboteur'.

At the same time Betty was driving an ambulance and working in a factory producing war materials.

'When it came to romance I loved and lost so often,' she says. 'I either found the ones who were unavailable but desirable or available but undesirable.'

After D-Day, Chapman was sent back to Britain to report on the accuracy of Germany's V-1 weapon, which was just being launched against London. He reported to the Germans that their bombs were overshooting their central London target when in fact they were landing in the city. The Germans corrected their aim with the result that many fell short of London in Kent, doing far less damage and saving a great many people.

Devoted: Betty put up with her husband having six mistresses

However Chapman's life during the war was not all derring-do. He had acquired two fiances, Freda Stevenson in England and Dagmar Lahlum in Norway. But he never forgot Betty.

When the war ended in 1945 he abandoned the other women and sought her out. He later wrote: 'Uppermost in my mind was the desire to find Betty, my girl whom I had last seen when I dived through a hotel window before my arrest in Jersey.' He engaged detectives to find her but they drew a blank.

'Eddie once said it was better to live one day as a tiger than a whole life as a lamb'

Lunching with them at the Berkeley 
Hotel they reported their lack of success to Eddie. One of the 
detectives, wondering what exactly they should be looking for, asked 
him: 'Is there anyone here who resembles her?'

Eddie pointed to a blonde with her 
back to him at the far end of the crowded dining room. 'That girl looks 
like her from the back,' Eddie said. Then she turned slightly. 'Jesus! 
It is Betty!' Eddie walked over and tapped her on the shoulder.

Just as her last moments with Eddie 
six years earlier had been punctuated with the sound of breaking glass, 
her first moments of reunion were accompanied by the sound of shattering
 crockery as her coffee cup smashed on the floor.

Charismatic: Eddie was hailed a hero by the Nazis and the Allies during World War Two

'I couldn't believe it. There was Eddie! 'Where did you spring from?' I asked him, having heard he was dead. And that's where it all began… again. Little did I know he would become my cross to bear for the rest of my life.

'When we were together he was all attention. But when he was on his way to meet a chum or have a drink in a local pub I could be sitting around waiting for him for the rest of the day or even a couple of days or more. Time had no meaning for Eddie.'

He proposed but Betty had doubts. 'He asked me every day for months. In the end I decided that life would be more interesting with him than without him.

'I wasn't going to have anything like a 'normal' married life but at the same time I found my life with him was exciting.'

They married on October 9, 1947 in London and their daughter Suzanne was born in 1954. 'He had six mistresses in his life and I used to say, when he was getting towards his end, 'You know, you had all those mistresses. How I wish there was one here now who could help me with you!' This usually elicited a laugh,' Betty recalls.

When asked what it was like for her when Eddie was away so long, either with a mistress or on some nefarious errand her reply was: 'I didn't let the grass grow!'

An extremely attractive woman she made a successful career in health farms, although she always fell short of the final step of commitment to someone else. The couple remained devoted to one another until his death on December 11, 1997 at the age of 83.

'The last words spoken to me by Eddie I shall remember vividly for ever. 'I love you', while sitting on his bed in his nursing home a few days before he passed on.

'Eddie once said it was better to live one day as a tiger than a whole life as a lamb,' she recalls. 'With Eddie life was lived at fever pitch, the adrenaline working overtime. You were never sure what country would be next or what scheme was coming up. I guess after such a war he never ceased to look for excitement.'
