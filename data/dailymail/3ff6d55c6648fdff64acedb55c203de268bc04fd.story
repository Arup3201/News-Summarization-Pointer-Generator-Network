On Raheem Sterling’s left wrist there is a tattoo of a young boy wearing a No 10 shirt and looking longingly at Wembley Stadium.

Sterling grew up on the mean streets of the notorious Stone-bridge Park estate and used to ride his bike with his mates to Wembley market on a Sunday morning.

In the shadow of the new stadium they would play football in the car parks and dream of growing up to represent their country at a World Cup. Last Saturday, in Manaus, Sterling slipped on the shirt for real.

Dreamer: Raheem Sterling's fantasy has now become a reality as he prepares to lead England's charge

‘I’ve got a tattoo of the stadium, a young boy with a football in his hands looking at the stadium and saying it’s a dream.

‘The stadium was literally round the corner and I’ve always wanted to play for England and be the best I can be.

‘I grew up five minutes away from the stadium. I used to ride my bike around this little car park and I used to say to myself, “One day, when this stadium is built, I’d like to play in there”. I am really  grateful to be given that opportunity.’ 

Sterling impressed against Italy after he was thrust into the role just behind Daniel Sturridge during England’s opening group game. It was Sterling’s pass out to Wayne Rooney on the left that began the move which led to Sturridge’s 37th-minute equaliser in the Arena Amazonia. Sterling showed no fear.

‘Every time I had the ball there were about three players around me,’ he said. Italy recognised his qualities from the off.

Raheem Sterling made an impressive start to his World Cup against Italy. The youngster had four shots at goal, more than any other England player.

As his confidence grew in the  second half, he even sprinted back nearly 40 yards to cheekily  dispossess the great Andrea Pirlo when he was idling on the ball just outside England’s penalty area.

‘I knew it was him on the ball and I will do anything for my team if it is something that I need to do,’ he added matter-of-factly. ‘To take it off such a good player is something I needed to do, but in the first half there was no point pressing him because he is so good he would just bounce around the corner.’

Sterling shows no inhibitions and this streetwise kid is ready for the next phase of his international career against Uruguay on Thursday in Sao Paulo.  

The England forward can make things happen and he has come a long way since his Anfield manager Brendan Rodgers barked out ‘Sterling - if you say "steady" one more time you’ll be on the first flight home’ in the Channel 5 documentary Being: Liverpool in the summer of 2012.

Two years on, after a brilliant second half of the season alongside Sturridge and Luis Suarez, he knows the qualities required to stay at the top of his game.

Pace: Raheem Sterling put in a lively performance during England's defeat against Italy

Sterling takes defeat personally and was so distraught after the game with Italy that he could not even respond to his mum’s text message.

‘Before the game she told me to relax and not to put too much  pressure on myself, or beat myself up,’ he added. ‘After the game, she dropped me a text and knew I wouldn’t reply until the next day because we lost, but she told me to get over it as quickly as possible.

‘She said I had to make everyone in the country proud, not just my  family.’ 

He did that with an enterprising and energetic performance in his first full England start. Now the stage is set. Sterling has no inhibitions, playing fearlessly and enjoying the experience of life at a World Cup as an England international.

‘I’m young and I’m learning, but I’ve got a lot to learn and I’ve got to grow up,’ he added. ‘I do worry about stuff, but I’m learning every day and have people around me guiding me in the right way,’ he added.

On Tuesday his England team-mate Frank Lampard, who has been acting as his chaperone, spoke highly of the young Liverpool forward.

Lampard turns 36 on Friday and has seen it all as an international, good and bad, during his distinguished career.

‘Raheem is instinctive, he can think on the pitch at the last  second because of his ability and pace,’ claimed Lampard. ‘Raheem is not the sort of kid walking around now as if he runs the hotel behind the scenes just because he’s been playing well.

‘It is such a goldfish bowl, but he has to live his own life. It sounds like his mother’s very strong with him and that will always help. He won’t want to upset her too much. We all need one of those.’

Lampard was particularly close to his late mother, Pat, and his advice to Sterling on Tuesday was striking. The youngster, to his credit, listened intently.

As he did when captain Steven Gerrard put an arm round him after the red card Sterling received against Ecuador during the build-up game in Miami, for a reckless challenge on Antonio Valencia.

That indiscretion is all in the past, Uruguay is all that counts now. England face Suarez and his pals in a game Roy Hodgson simply cannot afford to lose.

England’s head coach gambled by shifting Rooney out to the left against the Italians to accommodate Sterling in a central role after his eye- catching performances on the training ground.

‘The manager thought at the time that playing me in the middle was the best thing to do,’ explained Sterling.

‘But I don’t think the team was built around me. I don’t think he changed anything for me.’ 

It was a modest response, but this World Cup is made for players like Raheem Sterling.
