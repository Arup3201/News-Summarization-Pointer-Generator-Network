School officials in Denver are looking into an incident in which an autistic boy was allegedly tied down onto a seat by his bus driver.

The 3-year-old boy's grandmother, Kathy Griffin, told KMGH 'The supervisor told me [on the phone] that it was very disturbing. So I can only imagine what the footage was.'

A camera on the school bus captured the incident and the driver in question is currently on administrative leave, the ABC affiliate reported.

Incident: The 3-year-old boy's grandmother, Kathy Griffin has said 'The supervisor told me that it was very disturbing. So I can only imagine what the footage was'

Guardian: Griffin has said her three-year-old autistic grandson was tied down onto his seat 

Griffin is a guardian to the boy, as well as her four-year-old granddaughter, KMGH explained.

Co-guardian LaKesha Rouse told the affiliate station 'He suffers from autism. She has learning disabilities. We do everything we can to give them a good life.'

KMGH reported that the two young children use harnesses for their safety seats on their way to preschool.

The three-year-old figured out how to unfasten his and an assistant is meant to be on the bus and assist in that case, Rouse explained to KMGH.

Griffin told the news outlet 'Instead, what they had been doing to him was tying him down on the bus with ropes and putting belts onto the thing because he comes out of the harness.

'I know it's not safe to tie a child down anywhere, especially a vehicle.'

Passengers: The boy, along with Griffin's 4-year-old granddaughter, use harnesses for their safety seats on their way to preschool 

A representative for Denver Public Schools has said 'a bus driver was using an unapproved seatbelt-like device to keep a student in their safety seat'

A representative for Denver Public Schools told KMGH 'a bus driver was using an unapproved seatbelt-like device to keep a student in their safety seat.' 

The representative also said the bus driver may be fired in punishment.

KMGH reported that 'DPS is not releasing the video to the public, citing the ongoing investigation and student privacy.'

Rouse told KMGH 'We don't feel like it's enough. We feel they owe us an explanation because obviously with that happening, what else did he do?

'I would like to see the video, in fact, because what if they're not disclosing everything to us because they're so afraid of how upset we're going to get? Like I feel like they're hiding something.'
