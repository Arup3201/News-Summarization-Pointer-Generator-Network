Manuel Pellegrini’s demeanour is changing almost by the day. Usually so measured and mild mannered, he has begun to cut a very prickly figure. The pressure, it seems, is beginning to get too much.

One win in six will do that to you. Already eight points behind Chelsea and staring at an early Champions League exit, the prospects for Manchester City’s season appear bleak.

This is his toughest spell since taking over from Roberto Mancini and he looks under severe stress. 

He is third favourite to be the next manager to lose his job — behind Harry Redknapp and Paul Lambert — and was visibly agitated here as the champions offered little yet again, indebted to the brilliance of Sergio Aguero in bailing them out.

Pellegrini looks strained during the second half of his side's game against QPR

City are delighted the international break has arrived — Pellegrini hopped on a plane straight after leaving Loftus Road — and will try to regroup before the clash with Swansea a week on Saturday.

But problems remain all over the pitch, with a lack of invention in midfield and the softest of centres in defence. 

Martin Demichelis and the £32million Eliaquim Mangala aren’t up to it as a pairing. Where City would be without Aguero doesn’t bear thinking about. His goals have directly contributed eight league points from 11 games.

The slump has become so worrying that Bacary Sagna called this point ‘a good one’. Curious talk from players defending a title.

The City boss was very cagey during his post-match press conference 

‘There is a reason we play for City,’ the Frenchman said. ‘We want to show we can play for this team and succeed. Defensively we can do better, they created a lot of chances. 

Clear holding was evident with Bobby Zamora and whoever was marking him. Dean saw this and warned the players to stop.

'It is difficult to play a team in good form like QPR but we want to think positively. We lost a few games recently and it was important not to lose.’

Pellegrini is irked. He will not engage in debate surrounding his side’s dip, using the same rhetoric after each poor display.

‘I am sure we will continue to work in the same way we are doing,’ he said. ‘We’ll continue to play the style of play we always do. The team continues fighting, continues working until the end.’

What he will not entertain is criticism of the back four. Pellegrini snapped that Matija Nastasic, who hasn’t played a league game since February, has a ‘problem in his calf’ and that ‘we are the third best defence in the league, with one more goal than Chelsea. So be careful, we’re not so bad’.

Mike Dean was correct to disallow Austin’s goal after Hart kicked the ball twice from a free-kick. Had Hart taken the kick from outside his area then an indirect free-kick would have been awarded to QPR. On the other hand, Aguero was well offside for his first goal. I felt the subsequent handball was accidental. 

Joey Barton, who came on at half-time for his first appearance in six weeks, inferred that last season’s title win will not buy Pellegrini any time should City’s board think about change. 

The QPR midfielder said: ‘It sounds crazy to say this out loud but winning the league is almost not good enough. Everyone is aware they are struggling.

‘You have to show progress in the Champions League. They have the squad to compete on all fronts. They are one of Europe’s super-clubs with the spending ability they have.

'They are not going to judge themselves against the likes of little old us. It’s going to be against the likes of Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid.’

Only Newcastle's Les Ferdinand (13 in 1995-96), has scored more goals in the first 11 matches of a season than Aguero's 12.

Premier League survival may not be as daunting as Rangers had imagined thanks to the goals of Charlie Austin, who now has four in his last three. He might have added more than his one against City and Barton thinks he could be in the England squad.

‘It sounds like I am going to slag Rickie Lambert off but I am not,’ he said. ‘I just think if you can’t get a game for Liverpool, who can’t really hit a cow’s a**e with a banjo at the minute in terms of their frontline, how do you get in the England squad?’ 

YAYA IS A BIG HIT WITH CHLOE

Young Queens Park Rangers fan Chloe Power never saw it coming — neither Yaya Toure’s wayward shot nor his generosity. TV showed five-year-old Chloe, a season ticket holder along with her dad, being struck full in the face by Toure’s piledriver.

She was unhurt but Toure rang her to apologise and arranged for a signed City shirt to be sent to her.

QPR offered the five-year old girl a signed shirt and added that she was fine after speaking to her

1.‘We’ve just spoken to the young girl who was hit by @YayaToure shot – she’s fine & will enjoy these shirts!’ @QPRFC

2.‘Just spoke to the lovely Chloe and her dad on the phone. So glad she is OK’ @YayaToure

3. ‘Relieved to hear the girl my shot hit is ok. I was very worried. Also want to thank the City fans who traveled to support us today’ @YayaToure
