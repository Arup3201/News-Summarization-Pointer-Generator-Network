Thieves ransacked a vicar's house and stole his family's Christmas presents while he was out leading a Christmas carol service.

Simon Patterson, who leads Parkstone Evangelical Free Church in Poole, Dorset, returned home to find his front door ajar and his young children's Christmas presents missing from inside a wardrobe.

The father-of-four said a garden spade had been left next to the door and a tablet computer had been taken along with a woman's handbag containing a phone, purse and a digital camera.

He said members of the church had helped to replace the stolen items so Christmas could continue as normal for his children - a four-year-old, a two-year-old and 11-month-old twins.

'They took everything which was wrapped for Christmas, but not everything we own,' he said.

'Fortunately it was just a few small toys and a colouring books, which aren't of massive resale value, along with the tablet and handbag.

'Our family, friends and members of the church have replaced the things that we have lost.

'We were out at the time as we had a Christmas carol service and when my wife and I returned, we saw that we had been broken into.'

He  urged members of the public not to donate anything as they had already received presents from friends and family.

'We've had lots of generosity and gifts from other people,' he said.

A Dorset Police spokeswoman said: 'We were called to reports of a burglary on Ringwood Road which occurred sometime between 3.40pm and 5.50pm on December 21.

'Offenders gained access to the secured premises by forcing the front door and stole an unknown quantity of children's Christmas presents and jewellery.'
