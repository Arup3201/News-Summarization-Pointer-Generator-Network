A man who spent months sleeping in a lakeside trailer and days attempting to build the tallest ice sculpture in the world watched his roughly 60-foot creation come crashing down on Tuesday morning in Wisconsin.

A video of the Lake Superior Ice Project collapsing at 10:06 a.m. this morning was posted to the Minnesota artist Iceman Roger Hanson's Facebook Page.

Hanson was giving an interview about his project to the New York Times when the structure fell due to what Hanson believes is due to weeks of unseasonably warm weather.

Standing tall: This roughly 60-foot ice sculpture collapsed at 10:06 a.m. this morning

Toppling down: One of the icy pillars in the sculpture’s 17 foot base caved in and the rest of the structure came tumbling down with it

Bye, bye, sculpture: It hasn't been confirmed but the Superior Ice Sculpture was nearly 60-feet tall which would break the record for the world's tallest ice sculpture currently held by China

Since December, Hanson spent hours every day spraying lake water onto a cable strung between two poles. The water would freeze and create shapes that continued to grow higher and higher.

The Star Tribune reports that one of the icy pillars in the sculpture’s 17 foot base caved in and the rest of the structure came tumbling down with it.

It hasn't been confirmed but the Superior Ice Sculpture was nearly 60-feet tall which would break the record for the world's tallest ice sculpture currently held by China.

Yichun, China holds the record for tallest ice sculpture at 53 feet.

Superior officials gave Hanson $30,000 to try to break the record and he was aiming for building it up to 70 feet.

'The weather just wasn't with us this year,' said Superior Parks Director Mary Morgan to the Star Tribune.

Winter wonderland: The ice sculpture was meant to be a centerpiece for community gatherings starting on Valentine’s Day and wasn't expected to collapse until mid March 

On January 24 the weather was as high as 44 degrees. 

Morgan told reporters that city officials will discuss whether or not they will be able to save the project.

The ice sculpture was meant to be a centerpiece for community gatherings starting on Valentine’s Day.

The collapse wasn't expected sometime until mid-March.

'[I]ts collapse, expected sometime in mid-March, may also prove to be an exciting part of the process, the Superior-Douglas County Chamber of Commerce wrote on its site.

'Just think of the over 6 million pound ice crashing spectacle!'

The city planned events around the sculpture such as light shows, family activities, and bonfires.
