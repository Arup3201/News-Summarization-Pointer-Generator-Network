Actress Jacqueline Bisset says she has never married because she would not be able to put up with bad habits in a long-term relationship.

The 69-year-old actress recently won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series for her portrayal as Lady Cremone in the BBC's Dancing on the Edge. 

Bisset made headlines at the ceremony because of her bizarre, rambling acceptance speech. 

Now she has revealed that she has never married because she believes she is too independent.

Speaking to The Independent she said there had been many interesting men in her life. 

They include Michael Sarrazin, the ballet dancer Alexander Godunov and actor Vincent Pérez.

She said: 'I've been in seven-year relationships three times and one 14-year relationship.

'It's funny how it's always seven. 

'Sometimes you get too much information when you spend time with people. You start to see things – bad habits.

'You start to discover them and then you have to marry bad habits and I'm not sure I can cope with them.

'I don't ever have bad relationships.' 

Following her comeback at the Golden Globes this year, Bisset has just finished filming Welcome to New York - a film reported to be about the disgraced former head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

During the 1970s she appeared in François Truffaut's Day for Night, Murder on the Orient Express and The Deep.

Last month she joined Jane Seymour, 63, on U.S. TV where they both agree they would not succumb to the surgeon’s scalpel. 

In the past, Miss Seymour has admitted to minor eye surgery, breast augmentation and trying Botox just once, but she said these days she prefers the natural look. 

Miss Seymour told The Today Show: ‘I made a choice a while ago that I wanted to age gracefully. I stay away from Botox and all these things because [as an actress] I need my wrinkles. 

‘If I smile, I look younger. Smiling is the answer. Everything lifts when you do that.’

Her views were echoed by the glamorous Miss Bisset. 

During her speech at the Golden Globes she said: ‘I believe, if you want to look good, you’ve got to forgive everybody. It’s the best beauty treatment.’ 

And on TV she said she had ‘lots of complexes’ about her looks in her youth but she was still not tempted to go under the knife. ‘I don’t think it makes you look younger,’ she said. ‘It makes you different.’
