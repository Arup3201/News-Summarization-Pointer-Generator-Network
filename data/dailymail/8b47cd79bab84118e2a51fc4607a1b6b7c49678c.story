Common sense might tell you that taking a staycation will help save a few pounds compared to travelling of to foreign destinations.

But with decent weather, more people have opted to stay in the UK and hotels have been cashing in on extra visitors, making a quick weekend break at home much more expensive than last year.

Last year's best-value city was Birmingham where the total-stay package was £139.54 - more than £25 cheaper than this year's lowest-priced city, Nottingham.

The distinctive Edinburgh skyline is attracting many staycationers - but hotels have pushed up their prices

A stay in Birmingham was estimated at £183.82 this year, sixth cheapest among the 20 cities surveyed.

The recent spell of hot weather is one of the reasons hotels are cashing in while travel agents are tearing their hair out - as consumers ditch their holiday plans and instead enjoy the hot weather at home.

The predicted lengthy heatwave means that many have opted to save cash by transferring their holiday plans from exotic trips abroad to their local parks and pools.

TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: 
'With the great summer we've been enjoying, staycations are sure to be a
popular choice for UK travellers over the August bank holiday, but 
where you go will have a big impact on how much you're likely to spend.

Nottingham proves the least-expensive of 20 UK cities for an August 2013 overnight break including a hotel stay, pre-dinner Martinis, an evening meal out and taxi rides

'Generally, the further north you go the less you'll need to fork out for hotels and dinner, but there are some notable exceptions to that rule, so make sure you plan ahead.'

Those looking for cheaper city breaks should consider nights out in Nottingham rather than expensive evenings in Edinburgh.

Nottingham proves the least-expensive of 20 UK cities for an August 2013 overnight break including a hotel stay, pre-dinner Martinis, an evening meal out and taxi rides, the survey by TripAdvisor found.

The two-person break in Nottingham is £164.73 compared with £298.46 in Edinburgh - the most expensive of the 20 cities.

A four-star hotel in Nottingham averages £73.21 compared with £207.51 in Edinburgh.

The next-cheapest city when all the criteria are included is Cardiff (£167.51) followed by Sheffield (£175.81) and Leeds (£179.59).

Apart from Edinburgh the most expensive cities are Cambridge (£275.32), London (£264.41) and Brighton (£261.41).

London, though, does provide the least-expensive evening meal for two - averaging £54.47. The most-expensive meals are to be had in Cambridge (£69.92).
