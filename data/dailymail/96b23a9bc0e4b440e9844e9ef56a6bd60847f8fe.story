The missing plane MH370 could have been 'cyber-hijacked' using advanced electronic warfare technology, a new book co-written by a former lead Law and Order: SVU actor suggests.

The controversial theory is one among several canvassed in the new 257-page essay Someone Is Hiding Something, which also asks whether UFOs could be responsible for its disappearance.

The book was co-written by actor Richard Belzer - better known as detective John Munch in the syndicated fictional crime drama - radio host George Noory and author David Wayne. 

It's the latest in a series of publications and documentaries published since the plane went missing, with some aviation experts writing off the 'cyberhijacking' theory as 'far fetched'.

No wreckage of the missing plane has been located by official search parties. The Boeing 770-300 vanished on March 8 2014

But Perth widow Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on board, said that while she has been 'bombarded' with theories brought about by a slew of books, she has now become 'numb' to them.

'Someone's got to be right,' she said. 'I myself can't explain how such a sophisticated plane can just disappear.'

The current phase of the MH370 search will conclude in May, with the head of Australian Transport Safety Bureau saying he is hopeful the wreckage will hopefully be found in the next few months.

'POSSIBLE THEORIES' PUBLISHED IN THE BOOK 

'CYBERJACKING'

The authors believe the idea the plane was downed by 'cyberjackers' is among the more credible possibilities.

'Cyber hijacking is about the only possibility that fits the above circumstances insofar as the known evidence regarding the actions of the plane,' the book said. 

'We’re not saying that’s what happened. The evidence, at this juncture, is inconclusive. 

'We are saying that the official version of “We lost the plane and it may never be found” is an obvious ruse and a very weak one at that. 

'What we keep hearing as the official explanation of this case has got more holes in it than Swiss cheese—and a pretty “holey” batch of Swiss cheese.' 

Investigators searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 say they could finish scouring the priority zone by May, more than a year after it vanished, if there are no delays

'LANDED AT A MILITARY BASE'

One of the most popular theories circulated online is that the flight was diverted to a U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean, on the island of Diego Garcia.

It's a theory that still 'cannot be ruled out', the authors contend. 

'All in all, the evidence indicates that diverting Flight 370 to Diego Garcia, by whatever means, for whatever reasons, cannot be ruled out as a possibility.

'And we’re not saying that we know what those reasons are, or that that is definitively what happened to Flight 370. 

'But we are saying that diversion to Diego Garcia cannot currently be eliminated as a possibility,' they write.

The initial international search effort involved more than a dozen planes and at least nine ships

'MISSILE SHOOT DOWN' 

An 'accidental or intentional' strike followed by 'surreptitious debris retrieval' is highlighted as another theory by the authors. 

Given the widespread debris that would such an attack would cause, the authors suggest that the enormous search afterwards was 'actually part of a larger plan to discreetly recover and destroy what little evidence of the aircraft remained after the strike'.

'ALIEN CONTACT'

Co-author George Noory, who runs a US radio show that examines 'unexplained phenomena', told the Nine Network on Wednesday the possibility of alien intervention was 'fantastic, but possible'. 

In the book itself, the authors admit the eyebrow-raising possibility is rather unlikely, noting there is 'no evidence' so far. But the truth is out there, they write.   

'So, how does the possibility of alien life relate to Malaysia Flight 370, one might ask? That’s a damn good question. We have no idea.

'It’s just that it’s something that a discernible percentage of the population actually believes in and - if it is true - it’s an unknown that some apparently believe could possibly explain many otherwise unexplainable things, including the bizarre circumstances of Flight 370.

USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

The book posits that an advanced kind of electronic warfare technology could be deployed to 'hide' the missing plane. 

'Today’s electronic warfare (EW) capability includes weaponry that can hide planes,' the authors write in one passage.

Despite the lack of any evidence indicating sabotage, the book concludes the use of a 'cloaking technique' 'remains possible'.

Someone Is Hiding Something: What Happened to Flight MH370 by Richard Belzer, David Wayne and George Noory is published by Nero and on sale now.
