Twisted: Alberto Sierra, 28, has confessed to the murder of his wife and two stepdaughters in Florida

A husband confessed today to suffocating his wife and two stepdaughters, authorities said.

Alberto Sierra, 28, also admitted that he had raped eight-year-old Julia Padrino and her mother Gladys Sierra, 29.

He then murdered them along with the youngest girl Daniela Padrino, four, at their Miami home.

Sierra had gotten into a fight with his estranged wife on November 10 while they were driving to a Florida mall with the two girls. 

Alberto Sierra pulled out a knife and 'harmed' Mrs Sierra, according to a police report.

Miami-Dade Police did not describe her injuries from the argument.

Sierra then took the woman and her daughters back to the house in a Miami suburb, where he locked the girls in a bedroom and forced Gladys into the master bedroom.

He then suffocated her with a plastic bag and sexually assaulted her.

Sierra later suffocated the young sisters with a plastic bag and sexually assaulted the eldest.

Police said one of the girls was sleeping when she was suffocated.

The girls are not the defendant's biological children. Police say Mrs Sierra's six-year-old son was safe with his grandmother.

Sierra was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and sexual battery on an adult and on a child under 12. It is unclear if he had retained a lawyer.

A neighbor found the bodies of Mrs Machado and her daughters last Tuesday afternoon at their home after smelling a foul odor.

After searching the premises, the neighbor found the three bodies inside the master bedroom closet.

Sierra, a convicted felon who was recently released, turned himself in to Miami police the following night.

Little princesses: The 29-year-old had Julia, left, and Daniela, with her ex-boyfriend, Michael Padrino, who is also the father of her six-year-old son. The boy was not present during the murders

In October 2011, Sierra was 
investigated after one of his stepdaughters said that her 
stepfather had bitten her arm, the Miami Herald reported.

‘I do believe their lives are in danger,’ the girls’ biological father Michael Padrino wrote at the time.

Padrino asked a judge to award him sole custody of the children, but his request was denied.

Records show that Sierra was 
accused of domestic battery of his wife in October 2010.

According to an arrest report, the 
two had a ‘heated argument,’ and Sierra bit his then-girlfriend on the left forearm, stole her gun and drove off.

‘The only way you’re getting this gun
back is to shoot me,’ he told her before escaping, according to the 
report cited by the Herald.

Mystery: Gladys, pictured with her daughter Daniela, wrote a cryptic message on Facebook on Friday night

Two months later Sierra, who described himself as a marble worker, was arrested
for drug and weapon possession. The man admitted to police that he had 
stolen a 9-mm Smith & Wesson pistol and ammo during a burglary.

In June 2011, Sierra was sentenced to
a year of probation, but within two months he was re-arrested for 
driving, even though he was listed as a ‘habitual traffic offender'.

Machado
and Sierra were married in October 2011. The following month, police 
investigating a burglary came to the couple’s Flagami home, where 
they found two guns.

Sierra
was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and his 
probation was revoked. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 364 
days in jail. He was released on June 22.

Danger: Mrs Sierra had a violent fight in her car with her estranged husband before her death, a police report said

Doomed: Gladys worked as an administrative assistant for the Beauty Schools of America

A neighbor told Local10 that the family's two dogs were barking a lot last week, but other 
than that, nothing seemed amiss.

Hours before Sierra turned himself in
to police, Gladys Sierra's sister, Odalys, posted a message on her 
Facebook page along with her brother-in-law's picture which read: 'Help 
us find him my sister and my girls deserve him in prison please help.'

Last Tuesday, friends and relatives, 
including the father of Mrs Sierra's three children, Michael Padrino, 
gathered outside the house where the young woman was killed.

The man, who separated from Gladys in
February 2010 after a long court battle, told the paper that their 
other child, six-year-old Michael, was safe with his grandmother. The 
boy was not present during the murders.
