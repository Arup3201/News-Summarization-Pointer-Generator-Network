Life is full of scenes that you wish you could remember forever. Invariably though, even with the fastest responding digital cameras, cherished moments often pass before they can be pictured.

That said, it is questionable whether you would want a camera attached to you snapping virtually every moment of your life and transmitting the pictures to the internet where they will be stored forever.

In case you do, however, a Swedish tech startup has developed just such a device, and the service to go with it.

Good idea or bad idea? The tiny Memoto camera clips to your clothes and takes pictures every 30 seconds - capturing moments of your life that would otherwise be lost to fading memories

Discreet: Though it is just the size of a postage stamp, the Memoto incorporates a five-megapixel camera and GPS unit that geotags all the pictures it takes

Roughly the size of a postage stamp, the Memoto camera attaches discreetly to your clothes and automatically snaps geo-tagged photos - so no memory of your daily life is ever forgotten.

It has no buttons, but automatically captures the scene - and records the user's location - every 30 seconds before uploading the tagged images to the internet for review later.

Potentially the device gives users the chance to rediscover photos they never even knew were taken, capturing the moment, for example, when you first saw your future love or your baby flash a gummy grin.

Measuring just 26 x 26 x 9mm, the Memoto still manages to incorporate a five-megapixel camera and a battery that will keep snapping for about two days before needing a recharge.

Jogging memories: The Memoto will automatically snap every dog and tree you pass

Ping pong memories: Never again will an epic rally be lost to misty memories

Privacy concerns: The team behind Memoto promise that pictures uploaded to their servers will be encrypted and visible only the the user

To replenish the camera's power, users need simply to connect it to their computer; at the same time the device automatically uploads the pictures to Memoto's servers where they are catalogued accoring to date, time, location and even lighting conditions.

Photos can then be searched and shared through the company's web service or with the aid of a Memoto app which is scheduled for release on both iPhone and Android platforms.

Though some may be uncomfortable with loading images of their entire life to the cloud, with the camera generating 4GB of data a day - a phenomenal 1.5 terabytes a year - there really is no other practical storage option.

To assuage privacy concerns Memoto's team promises they will remain private by default, encypted and only visible to the user.

The team behind the Memoto are looking for funding to realise their project through Kickstarter. So far they have received about half their hoped for $150,000 dollars to bring the product to market and hope to put it on sale by 2013.

'Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp,' they say.

'We at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.'
