He spent more than half a century teaching the nation about the night's sky as the presenter of one of world's longest running television series.

Now Sir Patrick Moore's own private collection of manuscripts and observation logs, which chart nearly 60 years of staring at the stars,  are to be made available to the public to continue his legacy.

The Science Museum in London has acquired the astronomer's extensive personal archive, which he collected at Farthings, his home in Selsey, West Sussex.

Among the documents are notes that illustrate his contribution to our understanding of the heavens thanks to his prolific work as an amateur astronomer.

Draft scripts and memorabilia from The Sky at Night, which holds the record for the longest running television programmes with the same original presenter.

The collection also includes 70 of Sir Patrick's observation books, featuring detailed drawings and records of the night skies, alongside manuscripts for novels and astronomy books.

The Science Museum has also acquired a 12.5 inch reflecting telescope, nicknamed Oscar by Sir Patrick. He had used the telescope for mapping the Moon.

The collection also features rare photographs of Sir Patrick, who died two years ago today, at work in his study and showing his softer side while holding his cat Jeannie, taken by Brain May, the former Queen guitarist and astrophysicist.

The drawings were made on British Astronomical Association cards, an organisation he joined at the age of 11 years old and eventually became President of during his long career as an astronomer

May, who was a close friend of Sir Patrick, said: 'Patrick's friends and executors, have worked for a year to try to find the most fitting home for his core astronomical and personal archive.

'We're thrilled that the Science Museum has now agreed to give this precious resource a home.

'We're sure Patrick would be honoured that his legacy, a national treasure, will be in the perfect place - safe in Britain's top Scientific Museum, with plans for the material to be accessible to future generations.

'We feel there is no more fitting resting place for Patrick's legendary life's work.'

The collection consists of several hundred items, will be kept at the Science Museum's library and archives  at Wroughton, Wiltshire, where it will be catalogued before being made available to the public.

Alison Boyle, deputy keeper of science and medicine at the Science Museum, said: "Sir Patrick Moore was a towering figure in astronomy and broadcasting during a remarkable career spanning most of the 20th century. 

'This archive will help to inform the museum's future astronomy and space displays, and will become an important resource for all historians of popular astronomy.' 

Patrick Moore was probably one of the most eccentric yet instantly recognisable characters on British television after an onscreen career that spanned more than half a century.

However, despite his public profile, he kept a secret heartache through his life that shaped many of his views, that at times seemed abrasive.

Aged just 16, he joined the RAF as a Bomber Command Navigator at the start of the World War II after lying about his age. He turned down a place at Cambridge University to join up.

During the way he met a nurse called Lorna and the pair fell deeply in love before getting engaged.

However, just three years after they met, Lorna was killed during a German air-raid on London.

It was a loss that left the astronomer heartbroken and sparked a life long loathing for the Germans.

Sir Patrick remained a bachelor for the rest of his life and revealed in an interview shortly before his death that barely a moment went past where he did not think of her.

In an interview with the Daily Mail he said: ‘It’s a long time back now. She was in London when one of Hitler’s bombs fell. That was it for me. It went too deep. 

'There couldn’t be anybody else. She wasn’t there and there was no one else for me, so you make the best of a bad job.

‘We didn’t have enough time. And now we’re making friends with the Germans. If I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I’d push it down.

'There may be good, courteous, friendly Germans, but I haven’t met them.’

Sir Patrick spent much of the war working in intelligence against the Nazis but rarely spoke about what he did. 

The death of his father, Captain Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore, in 1947 from the gas he had inhaled back in the trenches of the Great War, also fuelled his hatred.

Through his long career after the war as an astronomer, he found he was unable to heal from the emotional wounds he had suffered.

He said: ‘I’ve had to visit Germany a few times during my career and as soon as I get there I’m in enemy territory. It’s absurd because I don’t feel the same about Japan.’
