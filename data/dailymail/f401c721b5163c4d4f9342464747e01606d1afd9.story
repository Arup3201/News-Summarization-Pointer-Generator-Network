BBC bosses hope to generate an audience of millions with Wolf Hall but it could also mean a shot in the arm for the Tudor souvenir industry.

Historic Royal Palaces has a large range of Henry VIII knick-knacks at its shops – including a 'divorced, beheaded, died' charm bracelet commemorating the fate of Henry's six wives at £24.99.

Other popular items include a hand-crafted Henry VIII doll for £250, a £200 Tudor Court pendant and a Tudor Court ring for £160.

A spokesman for Historic Royal Palaces, which covers Kensington Palace, Hampton Court, Tower of London and Kew Palace, said: 'We go in for all things Tudor, always have and always will do, so the interest in Wolf Hall is great for us.

'We always hope people will visit the palaces – we're a charity, so we fund everything we do by visitors.

'We always see the profile of the palaces being raised and more people coming down [after previous historical dramas such as The Tudors]. 

'We always hope people will visit the palaces, we're a charity, so we fund everything we do by visitors, so it's always good for us to get more interest and fingers crossed Wolf Hall will help us do that.'
