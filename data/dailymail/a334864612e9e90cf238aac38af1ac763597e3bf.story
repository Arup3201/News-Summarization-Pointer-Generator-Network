Britain could face another house price boom, fuelled by the ageing population and the rising number of immigrants, a Bank of England expert said yesterday.

In a research paper, Professor David Miles predicted ‘a rising trajectory for real house prices’.His report comes as the average asking price in one exclusive corner of London, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, hit £2million for the first time.

A decade ago, the average asking price in the area was £650,600, which means it has trebled in ten years.

House prices have recorded their biggest 'spring bounce' in eight years, fuelling hopes that the property market will be more robust in 2012 than last year

Professor Miles, who sits on the Bank’s 
interest rate-setting monetary policy  committee, also warned that 
changes to the mortgage industry since the credit crunch meant that 
young people will have to wait longer before they can afford to  buy a 
home because they will be saving  for a larger deposit.

House prices have dropped since the last boom, but Professor Miles said:
‘The trend of rising real incomes and the likelihood of rising 
population density means we should anticipate a rising trajectory for 
real house prices over the longer term.

‘This is particularly likely in a country like the UK where population density looks set to rise relatively fast.’

He singled out the ageing population, with one in six people currently 
alive in the UK expected to celebrate their 100th birthday, as well as 
the growing number of immigrants.

London asking prices reached a new high of £455,159, up 7.3 per cent year-on-year and all 10 regions in England and Wales recorded monthly price rises this month

At present, 62.2million people live in Britain, but the Office for 
National Statistics expects this number to balloon. By 2020, it is 
expected to hit 67.2million, rising again to 71.4million by 2030, 
according to the ONS’s latest population estimates.

The prospect of a further rise in house prices will be a cause for 
celebration for millions of homeowners, but a blow for an equal number 
trying to get onto the housing ladder.

Over the past 25 years, house prices have reached levels which leave 
many people unable to afford to buy their own home. In 1986, the average
home in a British city cost £35,209. Today the same property would cost
around £170,000.

In his report on population growth, house prices and mortgages, 
Professor Miles also painted a dramatic picture of how fundamental 
changes to the mortgage industry since the credit crunch will affect 
young people.

He said the mortgage market has changed in a ‘permanent’ and ‘very 
abrupt’ way which has been ‘stark, particularly for new buyers’. 
Professor Miles said: ‘The first effect is likely to be prospective 
buyers postpone their purchase, while they save more to accumulate a 
larger deposit.

‘As a result, the average age at which people would buy their first home
will rise, and the  share of owner-occupied houses will fall.’

The average age of a first-time buyer is currently 29, but this is 
heavily skewed by the fact that many only managed to buy after getting 
help from their parents. Professor Miles said the change in the mortgage
market is not a bad thing.

He said the fact that banks and building societies insist on large 
deposits to get the best loan deals is not the sign of a damaged market,
or one which is not functioning properly.

He singled out the 100 per cent mortgage deals, prevalent during the 
last boom, which allowed people to buy without saving a penny for a 
deposit.

Professor Miles said: ‘It probably never made sense for there to be 100 per cent mortgages.

‘There may be no price at which it makes commercial sense for such a loan to be available.’

The report comes at a time when soaring numbers of families are being 
forced to rent because they cannot afford to buy. The Government’s 
English Housing Survey shows 16.5 per cent of households in England are 
renting their home privately, the highest number since the 1970s.

Meanwhile, the number of homeowners is falling. Of the 21.9million 
households in England, 66 per cent own their home, compared with 70.9 
per cent in 2003, the year that it peaked.

By comparison, the number of private rents has jumped from two million in 2000 to 3.6million in 2010.

Matt Griffiths, from the first-time buyer campaign group Priced Out, 
warns: ‘A new  generation of families will be growing up in insecure 
rented accommodation.

‘They will face the possibility of eviction at short notice, making it 
much harder to settle down and have stability in where your children go 
to school or nursery.’
