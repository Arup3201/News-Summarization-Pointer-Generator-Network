David Simpson, the young British pilot who faced a death sentence while imprisoned in Central Africa, yesterday returned to his relieved family in North Yorkshire after a five-month ordeal.

In an emotional reunion with his parents, pheasant farmer Peter Simpson and his wife Vicky, David said he was 'terribly sad' to have caused them distress and anguish.

His mother, close to tears as she hugged him, said she always believed her son would return home safely.

'It's been unreal, months of sleepless nights and worrying sick,' she said. 'But I always believed I would get David back. We prayed and the whole village prayed, even people I don't know. I'm so thankful and happy to have him safe.

I'm home: David Simpson returns to the Yorkshire village of Gillamoor with a suitcase full of washing

'He's brought a suitcase full of washing with him, and he's already demanding my home cooking. We're going to have a proper family tea and watch the football results.'

David, 24, was working with a safari company in the tropical forests of the Central African Republic in March, clearing a track for four-wheel-drive vehicles, when he and his African employees discovered 13 mutilated corpses.

When he reported the deaths to local authorities in the eastern town of Bakouma, David and 13 staff members were arrested and accused of mass murder.

Corrupt officials had used him as a scapegoat, intending to force him to pay compensation to the dead men's families.

The assassinations were almost certainly carried out by the rebel group the Lord's Resistance Army.

For five months, David languished in a primitive rat-infested prison cell with 34 other men.

He suffered three malaria attacks and was told he could be executed if found guilty of the murders. He received release papers last week, clearing him of all charges.

Yesterday he shared a pint with his father at The Royal Oak Inn, the Simpsons' local pub in the village of Gillamoor on the Yorkshire moors.

David, travel-weary and 'overwhelmed' by his welcome home, said: 'I need to spend some quiet time with my family now. They can't really believe I'm home. I feel so bad for them. Most ofÂ  the time they had no idea what would happen to me and when we talked on the phone I couldn't tell them the true hell of it.

'I didn't want them to know I was sick. I didn't want them to know I could be killed by firing squad.'

Hellhole: David Simpson was held in dire conditions in a Central African Republic jail for five months

As general manager and safari pilot for Central Africa Wildlife Adventures, a Swedish-owned company, David intends to return to work in the inhospitable savannah and forests, some of the remotest on Earth, after a month's rest.

'I've made a life there,' he said. 'This year has been very bad for me but I feel I can cope with Africa and I feel I can do some good.'

He has started setting up an organisation to provide anti-poaching patrols for the Central African Republic. His mother now wants to visit him in this unlikely environment.

'I'm planning to go right out to the wild places where he spends his days,' she said. 'You need to know where your kids are, don't you?'
