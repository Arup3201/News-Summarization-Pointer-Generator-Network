First home buyer activity has hit a new low with recent research showing August recorded the lowest levels in 15 years.

There were 6,054 first home buyers committed to housing finance over the month, according to RP Data research which used housing finance data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

This is the lowest month reading since June 2000, outside of the seasonally low months of January and February.

The dramatic decline since then was caused by rising property prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, and the changes made to the availability of First Home Buyer grants.

Recent RP Data research shows 6,054 first home buyers were committed to housing finance in August - the lowest since June 2000

Lavish properties like this Mediterranean-style home in Sydney's most expensive street in Point Piper - in the eastern suburb - seem well out of reach for first home buyers

The palatial home, which boasts 270 degree views of Sydney Habour, is on Wolseley Road and sold for more than $37 million earlier in the month

The price set a nationwide record for a non waterfront home and was the highest priced sale recorded so far in 2014

RP Data research director Tim Lawless found the ABS housing finance data underlined a severe lack of first home buyer participation in the market.

He says that the broad slowdown in first home buyer demand can probably be attributed to a few factors.

'With dwelling values rising at a time when average wages aren't rising anywhere near the same pace, affordability constraints are dampening first home buyer demand,' he said.

'This is particularly the case in Sydney and Melbourne where dwelling values have risen substantially.'

Mr Lawless adds that The First Home Buyer Grant has had a huge impact on the market over the years.

He says the grant boost of $14,000 in 2009 increased the number of active first timers in the housing market, reaching a record high of 18,744 in May.

'When the "boost" to the First Home Buyers Grant was scaled back in October 2009 and then removed in January 2010 we saw first home buyer numbers virtually fall off a cliff,' Mr Lawless said.

This trend has followed suit over the years with changes to either stamp duty concessions or eligibility to first home buyer grants.

A director of the research says affordability constraints are dampening first home buyer demand and changes to the availability of First Home Buyer grants also caused the record low

Mr Lawless says more first time buyers are purchasing investment properties, which doesn't include them in the Bureau of Statistics first home buyer figures.

'Where a first home buyer isn't eligible for a grant or concession they may simply be flying under the radar and not being counted,' Mr Lawless said.

'For many first home buyers, the areas where they would like to live are simply too expensive for them to buy into, so they purchase an investment property while renting in an area closer to where they work and play.' 

The states and territories showing the most severe first home buyer trends are NSW, Victoria, Queensland and the ACT.

While stronger first home buyer trends and conditions were recorded in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.

However that trend has remained stagnant since mid-2013 in South Australia and Western Australia but has remained quite active in Tasmania, Mr Lawless says is reportedly the most affordable state for housing.
