Team news

Liverpool

Misfiring striker Mario Balotelli is likely to keep his place for the visit of Hull as manager Brendan Rodgers has limited options up front.

The 24-year-old has scored just once in 10 appearances but with Daniel Sturridge still sidelined by a calf problem the Italy international will probably start ahead of Rickie Lambert.

Midfielder Adam Lallana is pushing for a starting place after impressing as a substitute in the midweek defeat to Real Madrid.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Skrtel, Moreno, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Lallana, Balotelli, Sterling, Jones, Manquillo, Toure, Enrique, Can, Markovic, Lucas, Coutinho, Lambert.

Hull

Injuries have hit Hull hard in the past week, meaning big changes for the trip to Liverpool on Saturday.

Third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic is in line for only his second Barclays Premier League start with Allan McGregor (shoulder) and Steve Harper (bicep) both out, while striker Nikica Jelavic (knee) and centre-back Michael Dawson (ankle) are both missing for at least a month.

Left-back Andy Robertson has a knock that is set to keep him out too, but Tom Huddlestone should be fine to play through discomfort for the third game in a row.

Team (provisional): Jakupovic, Watson, Davies, Rosenior, Chester, Bruce, McShane, Elmohamady, Meyler, Diame, Huddlestone, Livermore, Brady, Ramirez, Aluko, Quinn, Hernandez, Ben Arfa, Aluko, Ince.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Liverpool have scored 10 goals in three Premier League home games against Hull City.

The Tigers have only won one of their 18 meetings with the Reds in all competitions (D4 L13), with that win coming on home soil last season.

Neither of Liverpool’s scorers in this fixture last season (Agger, Suarez) remain at the club.

Steven Gerrard has three goals in two starts against Hull at Anfield.

Hull (along with Chelsea and Everton) are one of only three teams to score in every Premier League game this season.

Mario Balotelli has put more clear cut chances off target than any other Premier League player this season (3).

After winning 11 Premier League games in a row between February and April, Liverpool have won just five of the subsequent 11 matches.

The Reds have kept just one clean sheet in their last 14 Premier League matches.

Liverpool have conceded exactly one goal in each of their last five Premier League games at Anfield.

Hull’s last two away games have ended 2-2. Only two teams in Premier League history have recorded three successive 2-2s away from home (Man Utd in 1994 and Newcastle in 2003).

Liverpool have both taken (129) and scored (98 – level with Chelsea) the most penalties in Premier League history.
