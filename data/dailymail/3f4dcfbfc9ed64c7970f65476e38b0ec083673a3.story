BT Sport have made an approach to BBC’s Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker to host their Champions League football starting next season.

The inquiry about using Lineker in midweek to anchor BT’s marquee sports property will come as a shock to BT’s main football presenter, Jake Humphrey, who was poached from the BBC and is the face of their Premier League coverage.

Approach: BT Sport wanted BBC presenter Gary Lineker to host midweek Champions League coverage

However, Lineker turned down the BT offer because terms and conditions couldn’t be agreed. And working for the subscription channel would have meant renegotiating his BBC contract that gives the Corporation exclusivity on Lineker’s services to an UK audience.

But Lineker, now established as one of the top TV sports presenters and ranked in the pantheon alongside David Coleman and Des Lynam in the 50th anniversary MOTD documentary to be screened next Friday, also has a Premier League football deal with American network NBC and has done Walkers Crisps commercials for approaching 20 years.

Meanwhile, BT are taking a big risk having new pundit Paul Scholes pitchside at Old Trafford before the game against Swansea when fans chanting his name might make it difficult for his short, sharp comments to be heard.

Risk: Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes will be pitchside at Old Trafford on Saturday

It didn't go unnoticed between Liverpool and Manchester United players as they queued at an airport departure gate in the United States during pre-season tours that the United 767 jet was a whole lot bigger than the 747 carrying Liverpool. No wonder, when United took 130 personnel to the USA — substantially more even than the top-heavy 88-strong England party at the World Cup.

It showed how much the stature of BBC TV football commentators has diminished that the celebrity guests for the first showing of the Match of the Day 50th anniversary documentary included Barry Davies and John Motson, who have a combined age of 145. 

But the pair are still far more synonymous with MOTD than the current crop of anonymous Beeb football commentators, although Guy Mowbray did feature in the programme.

Jacqui Oatley, the first female commentator on Match of the Day, was given the platform to moan about Press comment on her unfortunate debut. But since Oatley rightly decided to concentrate on presenting and reporting on radio, no female has emerged as a genuine football commentator in the way the excellent Alison Mitchell has in cricket.

It wouldn't fit in with many sports scientists’ idea of the best post-match recovery meal, but it is understood that Middlesbrough contacted Leeds to request six stone-baked pizzas — three chicken, three vegetarian — to be delivered to the away dressing room at Elland Road straight after Saturday’s Championship game.

Gould awaits ECB call

After Lancashire’s drainage debacle at Old Trafford, which won’t help their slim chances of being awarded an Ashes Test in 2019, Surrey chief executive Richard Gould is especially keen that nothing should go wrong at The Oval during the fifth Test.

The ground is already assured of another Ashes Test in its staging agreement, but Gould is the current favourite from inside cricket to succeed David Collier as ECB chief executive, although the headhunters are looking outside the game as well.

With rather less ballyhoo than their self-celebration — Sky’s pundits were ordered to send out anniversary tweets — at covering 200 England Test matches, Sky have closed down their online Sports News Radio service that was once seen as a long-term competitor to Radio 5 Live and talkSPORT. A Sky spokesman said: ‘Customers’ habits evolve over time and a standalone sports radio service is sadly no longer viable. We are in the process of consulting with affected staff.’ And Sky’s multi-million-pound experiment with 3D football is heading straight for the knacker’s yard as well.
