James Milner may be able to laugh at the Twitter account set up to highlight his boringness, but is @boringmilner the most accurate parody account around?

The England star joked on Monday that he wished his Foundation's account @JM7Foundation had as many followers as the parody account - around 15,000 compared with more than 250,000 - but aside from that Milner was hardly riveting.

So, can you guess which of the below quotes are actually from the Manchester City man in his press conference on Monday and which belong to the parody account?

Speaking out: James Milner was centre of attention during Monday's press conference

1. Against different teams we obviously are going to have to play in different ways and we've got the players to do that.

2. Football injuries happen unfortunately and if it happens it happens.

3. Just asked Lallana if he enjoyed his debut. He said that he did. I said it's good that you enjoyed it. He said yes it is.

4. The weather's been pretty similair to back home in Manchester - pretty wet.

All smiles: Milner was in high spirits as he joked about his Twitter parody account

5. I've just taken my shoes off and realised
 I've been wearing one sock inside out all day. I told Gary Cahill and 
he said it was really funny.

6. The manager picks the best team he thinks will win the game.

7. When we were 2-0 down I thought we might lose but we scored three times and won 3-2 instead.

8. We had a jog and things and got the legs going in the gym. 

9. We have won the Premier League. I am really happy about this!

10. The manager has picked a squad where every base is covered. He's got a lot of different players in there that can do everything.

11. I sent Yaya a birthday message but he said It's not his birthday. It was so funny, I bet he hasn't stopped laughing.

12. Everybody is giving 100 per cent in training and going into the games everybody wants to have their name on the team-sheet.

13. When I stepped off the plane in Miami I thought it was really warm and I was right because when I checked the temperature it was 27°c.

Brothers in arms: Milner is good friends with Manchester and England team-mate Joe Hart

14. I told Baines I liked his boots. He said Thanks. I said Did you buy them in a sports shop? He nodded. I said I got mine in a sports shop too

15. All three games are equally as important and we need to concentrate on all of them the same.

16. I just went to text Joe Hart but I accidentally text David Silva instead. It was so funny.

Full of running: Milner against Peru

  Q: What was it like at training today in terms of weather conditions? Pretty similar to back home in Manchester really - pretty wet. But there was no change (to our plans). Everything we were going to do on the pitch we did in the gym anyway. Obviously after a long flight most of the session which we were told we were going to do was gym based. We had a jog and things and got the legs going in the gym and it didn't affect us in anyway to be honest.

We've done the preparation up to this point the best we can using the methods, and no stone has been left unturned so we are more than ready. Obviously now we are here (in Miami) it is mimicking the conditions that we are going to have out in Brazil so it is the perfect preparations and come that first game I don't think we will be able to be anymore prepared than we are.

There's a real professional feel around the squad, everybody knows exactly what is expected of them and, like I said, the preparation has been second to none. We covered every base and the lads are raring to go with two more games to go and it is the perfect lead in in these condition to go over to Brazil.

Obviously you want to contribute as much as you can and be in that starting line-up, but the manager picks the team he thinks is the best to win that game and as long as England win the game that's the most important thing and hopefully I can be a part of that. But any team that does well at a World Cup takes a full squad and the players that aren't playing - even if you are injured and still in the squad - still have a massive part to play, and help as much as you can off the field and be part of that dressing room and in training.

The manager has picked a squad where every base is covered and he's got all different players in there who can do everything and however the manager wants to set up and play the game he has got the players to do that. There's great versatility there however he wants to set up. Obviously against different teams you obviously need to play in different ways, and I think he has the players to do that. Q: With the latest rush of injuries, how does it affect you as a player knowing the World Cup is not far away but there are a few games left?

You can't really worry about injuries at this stage. You go out there and are preparing for a major tournament. Everybody is giving 100 per cent in training and going into the games, everybody wants to have their name on the team-sheet so injuries don't really come into your mindset. The preparation is done, we do all the pre-activation stuff before training and games and the strength work in the gym. Football injuries happen unfortunately and if it happens it happens. But as a squad of players and a group of staff everything is done to reduce the risk of injury. Q: Do you think you need to focus on Uruguay and Costa Rica to go through the group? All three games are equally important and we need to concentrate on them the same. The first one we concentrate on more because we are going to take it a game at a time. Obviously we play more games against European opposition in club and international football so it was more important in the warm-up games to get used to playing against Latin American teams and get that experience. I think the way the games have been set up for us and with the full preparation, it has been a really good build up for us and hopefully we can continue the form we showed in the last game through these next few games and go into that first game (against Italy) with a bit of momentum and confidence.
