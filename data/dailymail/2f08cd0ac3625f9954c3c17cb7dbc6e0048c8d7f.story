Did Vice President Joe Biden call a former congressman his 'butt buddy' during a speech in Iowa this afternoon?

Biden, known for making inappropriate slips of the tongue, appeared on Thursday to refer to a former Iowa lawmaker Neal Smith his 'butt buddy' while making remarks at Drake University.

Butt buddy is a term that can mean two close friends who are considered inseparable. But it also has homosexual connotations.  

Oh, Joe: Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here on Wednesday at a White House event, appeared on Thursday to refer to a former Iowa congressman as his 'butt budy'

In video posted to YouTube of the event, the gaffe-prone VP can be heard asking if his 'old butt buddy' Smith was in the crowd.

'Neal, I miss you man,' he added emphatically. 'I miss you.'

A fellow Democrat, Smith served in the House while Biden was in the Senate. 

Smith, 94, is the longest serving member of the House of Representatives in Iowa's history, holding his seat from 1959 to 1995. 

Despite his self-proclaimed interest in seeking the presidency in 2016, Biden has stayed largely stayed away from media opportunities in the last several months after making a string of embarrassing verbal mistakes while on the campaign trail during the midterm elections.

At another Iowa event, this one in September, Biden referred to the former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as 'the wisest man in the Orient.'

That followed an incident the day before in which Biden, while telling a story about money lenders who take advantage of armed service men and women, called the financiers 'Shylocks.'

The term Shylock is often associated with a Shakespearean play about greedy Jewish lender of the same name and is considered an anti-Semetic slur.

Biden immediately apologized for comment calling it a 'poor choice of words' 

The VP was at Drake this morning to push the White House's free tuition plan for community college students.
