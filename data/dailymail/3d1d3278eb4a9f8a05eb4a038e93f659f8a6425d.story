A mother from Connecticut is demanding an investigation take place into how her five-year-old son was picked up by another boy's great-grandfather.

The mix-up was only spotted after the man's wife discovered that he had brought home the wrong child.

The grandpa claimed that he had 
mistakenly picked up the wrong kid because he was wearing a similar hat 
and had it pulled down over his head!

Now the parents of the first grader, 
Everett Stone from Sterling, are demanding action by local officials and
 that disciplinary action be taken against the staff at the school.

Mixup: Angela and Derek Stone said their 5-year-old son was waiting for the bus at Sterling Community School on Friday when a man walked up to him and mistook the little boy for his own great-grandson and brought the boy to his house

Fuming: A great-grandfather brought the wrong boy home from a Connecticut school. Now, the boy's parents, Derek and Angela Stone are calling the administrators incompetent and demand the school take action

The grandfather picked up what he thought was his five-year-old grandson and ushered him into the car.

The
 duo clearly did not speak a word during the car journey, because it 
wasn't until they arrived home that the error was noticed by the 
eagle-eyed grandma.

Angela Stone says her son refused to get out of the man's car at his home, and the man's wife noticed the mistake. He then drove the boy back to the school.

'Once the grand great-grandmother sees the boy and removes his hat, she realizes it's not her great-grandson and calls the school to say the great-grandfather has taken the wrong kid,' Stone said during an emergency Board of Education meeting held in Sterling on Tuesday night.

Up until that point, the school had been unaware that little Everett was missing. Stone said her son arrived home in a state of shock and refused to talk about what had happened.

'This unbelievable and terrifying incident has placed a spotlight on the school's lack of security, particularly at bus pick-up and drop-off time,' she said.

Stone called school officials incompetent and says they should be disciplined.

The boy's uncle, Paul Stone, told NBC News he was upset with how the school handled the incident.

'The school asked him to bring the child back,' Paul Stone explained. 'That was a totally inappropriate response. They should have, at that point, called authorities and had them go handle the child.'

Her anxiety and fear turned into rage when that didn't happen. She said police and the Department of Children and Families only investigated at her request.

'Ms. Klebart and Mr. Musumeci have proven themselves incompetent leaders of our school,' said Stone.

Joseph Musumeci is the principal of the Sterling Community School. Rena Klebart is the superintendent of the district.

Stone told the Board of Education Tuesday night that she has no confidence in school leaders because school pickup has always been a problem.

School Superintendent Rena Klebart, 63, acknowledges mistakes were made and says officials are making changes to prevent it from happening again.

'I do understand how upsetting this is,' said Sterling Superintendent. Rena Klebart. 'I understand how upset our staff is because we take our responsibility very seriously.'

Klebart said the grandfather followed the school's policy by showing ID and signing out the correct student.

Superintendent Rena Klebart: She says that student safety is a priority. 'We are very concerned with their safety and we want to be sure parents feel secure, students feel secure,' Klebart said

Policy: New rules have come into force that require parents to show ID and for the child to have a note stating who is picking them up at the end of the school day

Sterling School: The school has now changed its pickup policies to ensure a mixup like this is prevented from happening again

School staff members should have watched him retrieve the child, Klebart said, and that part of the incident is under investigation.

'Of course it's concerning. We are responsible for the safety of our children,' she said. 'Weâ€™ve increased the number of staff members who are on-duty during dismissal.'

The superintendent met Monday with the parents of the students involved and have updated their pickup policy.

Students must now have a note naming the adult picking them up. The adult must show identification prior to pickup.

Ms Stone said this isn't the first time school security concerns have been brought to light.

'We all expressed that dismissal was a disaster waiting to happen,' she said. 'This past Friday, that disaster became my family's reality.'
