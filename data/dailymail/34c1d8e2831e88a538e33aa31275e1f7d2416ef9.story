A father who claims he and his family suffered food poisoning after eating at a curry house is facing jail after campaigning to stop other diners going there.

Nick Diver-Legge, 48, became ill after a chicken tikka and salad meal at the B26 restaurant in Birmingham.

He spent the following weeks determined to spread his views about the restaurant – writing a scathing online review and posting flyers warning that 'the B26 should be avoided at all costs if you value your health'.

His campaign was so successful the restaurant suffered a 30 per cent fall in trade, leading the owner to contact police, who charged Diver-Legge with harassment.

At Birmingham Magistrates' Court, district judge Robert Zara said the father, of Hall Green, Birmingham, had gone beyond what was 'justified'.

He faces up to six months in prison when he is sentenced later this month. However, he plans to appeal against his conviction.

The plumber, who claims he lost thousands of pounds while off work ill, said the court's decision was a breach of his freedom of speech, adding: 'I am the innocent party.'

He said he and his 18-month-old son were sick for a week and his wife Jennifer for two weeks.

B26 owner Mitt Balli described the campaign as 'very upsetting' and said he had had to lay off staff as a result of the fall in takings.

Guilty: Nick Diver-Legg stuck up hundreds of 'public health warning' flyers, and wrote a damning online review, a court was told

Diver-Legg, his wife and two other members of his family had gone for a meal at the restaurant last November, Andrew Crump, prosecuting, said

They had subsequently suffered from food poisoning and just over a week later the defendant went to the premises and demanded compensation.

Diver-Legg also told the manager, Mitt Balli, that he was going to hold a protest barbecue outside the restaurant and invite friends and the police.

Two weeks after visiting the restaurant, he posted a review on a website complaining of what had happened to him and his family.

It warned readers that if they wanted to suffer from projectile vomiting and the ‘worst diarrhoea they could imagine’ then B26 was ‘ideal’.

In addition he handed out leaflets and stuck up hundreds of flyers on a bus stop, a bank and other buildings, warning people not to eat there.

Mr Crump said Diver-Legg made numerous phone calls and when he visited the restaurant refused to leave until the manager called the police.

'Basically what he has said you don’t have the right to public protest or freedom of speech. It has been really stressful. I just wanted to have a meal without it resulting in me and my family becoming seriously ill'

Mr Balli told the court he had felt ‘very down’ and said what had happened was ‘very upsetting’.

Diver-Legg was convicted of harassment in court but said he would appeal.

He said outside court: ‘Basically (the judge) has said you don’t have the right to public protest or freedom of speech. It has been really stressful.

‘I just wanted to have a meal without it resulting in me and my family becoming seriously ill. I feel it should be the restaurant that should be convicted.’

He told the court he was targeting a ‘business entity’ and not the manager.

But District Judge Robert Zara said he had gone beyond what was ‘proportionate and justified’ and adjourned sentencing until September 28.
