Nicolas Anelka is likely to receive a lengthy ban today over his quenelle goal celebration against West Ham last month.

The news comes after West Bromwich Albion’s sponsors Zoopla on Monday pulled the plug on their £3million partnership with the club over the affair.

Mid-air: All eyes were on Anelka at the Hawthorns after recent events off the pitch

The French striker, who new manager 
Pepe Mel insisted on picking for Monday night's 1-1 draw with Everton at
 the Hawthorns, is set to become the first player charged by the FA 
under guidelines to combat racial discrimination brought in after the 
Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra affair.

Anelka
 is likely to be given a ban similar to Suarez’s eight games after the 
Liverpool striker was found guilty of using racially abusive language 
towards Manchester United’s French defender Evra in 2011.

Anelka
 showed no signs of being affected by the controversy last night and he 
enjoyed the backing of the West Bromwich fans, who cheered his first 
touch and chanted his name just four minutes into manager Mel’s first 
game.

Statement: West Bromwich Albion supporters cover the name of their sponsor Zoopla with duct tape

Gesture: Anelka is to discover his fate after an FA investigation into his goal celebration at West Ham

He was given a 
standing ovation by the crowd when he was substituted after 76 minutes. 
Mel said he had not considered  dropping the striker.

‘We needed to win,’ said the Spaniard. ‘Nicolas is a very good player, a very good professional and I am only the head coach.

‘If he is suspended I will not be able to play him, but all we can think of is football matches.

‘I
 spoke to him yesterday and asked if he was ready to play. He said he 
was and it is my obligation to West Bromwich to pick the best team.’

No more: West Brom announced the that Zoopla would not extend their contract with the club

Represent: Anelka was named in the starting XI and wore the club's sponsor Zoopla at the Hawthorns

However,
 Anelka’s actions have led to Zoopla announcing they will not renew 
their backing when their £3million, two-year deal expires at the end of 
the campaign.

Zoopla.co.uk 
is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a 
privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division 
of DMGT plc, the company who own the Daily Mail and MailOnline.

A
 statement from the property company read: ‘Zoopla have been reviewing 
their position over the past few weeks in light of the actions of 
striker Nicolas Anelka during the match against West Ham over the 
Christmas period and have decided to focus their attention on other 
marketing activities after this season.’

'Zoopla
 pay £3million to sponsor West Bromwich Albion. That gives them the 
right to spoil the famous striped shirts a little, but not to pick the 
team.'

The
 quenelle is similar to a Nazi salute with the arm pointing downward. 
Placing fingers on the opposite shoulder has also been described as a 
lesser-known Nazi salute.

Anelka
 denied he was  being anti-Semitic or racist by celebrating with the 
quenelle, which he claimed he did in support of his friend Dieudonne 
M’Bala M’Bala, an anti-establishment comedian. But the  34-year-old did 
promise not to repeat the gesture.

Following
 Zoopla’s announcement, Albion said in a statement: ‘West Bromwich 
Albion have been fully aware since the sponsorship agreement came into 
force in June 2012 that their partnership with Zoopla could expire this 
summer and therefore have been planning accordingly.

Friends: The then-West Brom acting head coach Keith 
Downing says that the gesture was a dedication from Anelka (right) to 
his French comedian friend Dieudonne (left), which Anelka reiterated on 
Twitter

‘Zoopla have today informed the club in writing that they do not wish to extend their sponsorship deal.

‘The club will now actively seek a new official sponsor for next season.’

Lawrence
 Hall, Zoopla’s head of communications, said: ‘Through our sponsorship 
of West Bromwich Albion, we are pleased to have supported the local 
community and charities.However, we have  decided to re-evaluate this 
sponsorship.’

The FA have made no  comment about their investigation other than to state an independent expert has been used during the probe.

Anelka’s gesture sparked a furore, particularly in France, where it has been declared anti-Semitic and racist.

It was described by France’s sports minister Valerie Fourneyron as ‘disgusting’.

After
 scoring in West Brom’s 3-3 draw at West Ham, striker Nicolas Anelka 
celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted Nazi salute created by 
his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala — 
which has anti-Semitic connotations.

The
 gesture is relatively unknown in the UK but there is an angry reaction 
in France with the country’s sports minister calling Anelka’s actions 
‘disgusting’.

Headline: Martin Samuel called for Anelka to be kicked out for the gesture

December 29

Anelka
 says on Twitter: ‘I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic. The meaning of 
quenelle is anti-system. I do not know what religion has to do with this
 story. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations 
of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion.’

The
 FA begins investigating the incident while Sportsmail’s Martin Samuel 
calls for Anelka to be banned for knowingly bringing an anti-Semitic gesture to a wider audience.

January 10, 2014

The FA reveal that they are working with an ‘appointed expert’ as part of their investigations into  Anelka’s quenelle. But the delay in making a decision is widely criticised.

January 17

West
 Brom’s shirt sponsors Zoopla threaten to end their £3million deal 
unless Anelka is axed. They say they will remove the Zoopla name from 
the home shirts if he is picked for the next match.

January 20

Just hours before Monday’s
 kick-off against Everton, Zoopla, who have sponsored West Brom since 
2012, announce that they will not renew their deal with the club at the 
end of the season as a result of Anelka’s gesture.

When
 West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in 
Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a
 gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But
 the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a 
fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and
 stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here,
 we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of 
its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political 
activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
