it is the stuff of nightmare for some, but one three-year-old dog managed to survive a night at the bottom of a water-filled 80-foot mine shaft.

Maddie, the seven-stone Rottweiler, vanished as owner Nick Lake took her for a walk in Camborne, Cornwall.

He frantically searched bushes and undergrowth in vain unaware she had fallen into the disused shaft.

Seven stone Maddie was rescued from a 25-metre mine shaft after treading water for 24 hours

Nick, a pub landlord, spent a sleepless night worrying and returned to the scene the following morning.

When he heard Maddie's faint whimpering from the hole he realised that the exhausted dog had been swimming in the water for 24 hours.

He raised the alarm and a 19-strong rescue team of firefighters swung into action and lowered a cargo net to reach her.

It took two men to lift the hefty 45kg dog and the crew were amazed she had managed to keep herself afloat for an entire day.

Nick, 67, who runs the nearby Countryman Inn, said: 'She just went into the undergrowth, as she normally does, and did not come back.

'I searched the area but couldn't find her. It was so windy I couldn't really hear anything.

'I set out early the following morning, I hadn't really slept because I was so worried.

'I was calling her name for ages and eventually I head Maddie's whimper in the distance.

'I kept calling her and eventually came across an open mine shaft. It was too far down to see, but I heard her respond to my call.'

Nick has praised the firemen after the ordeal, saying that they had worked quickly and efficiently

Maddie was cold and numb after her ordeal but otherwise unscathed and was taken home to the pub after her 45-minute rescue to warm up in front of the fire.

Nick added: 'All of the firefighters had a role, they were very efficient. I cannot praise them enough. They gathered quickly, analysed the situation and cracked on.

'I urge dog owners just to be aware of the mine shafts. I am going to speak to various people to try and get some barriers put up to stop this happening again.

'Maddie's a lucky dog. I certainly don't think I could have kept swimming for 24 hours'.
