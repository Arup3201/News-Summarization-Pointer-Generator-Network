Gennady Golovkin is one of the most dangerous men in boxing, possessing fists of steel, a granite and the aura of a master.

Ahead of his WBA middleweight title fight with Britain's Martin Murray on Saturday, Sportsmail takes a look at the anatomy of the man who has 28 knockouts from 31 fights.

Heads he wins

Golovkin is a fine strategist. He has an excellent sense of when to maintain distance and when to press. Only weakness is having no experience of going the distance.

Eyes and vision

Excellent connection-rate and brilliant timing of punches shows his co-ordination. Opponents frquently speak of his impeccable distanc control.

Gennady Golovkin has the anatomy of a God of War with 31 wins featuring 28 knockouts 

Date of birth: April 8, 1982, Kazakhstan

Nicknames: Golden Boy, God of War

Height: 5ft 10½inches

Weight: (11st 11lb) 75kg

Reach: 5ft 10ins

Amateur record:

345 wins, five losses. Amateur World champion 2003, Olympic silver medal 2004

Professional record:

31 fights, 31 wins, 28 KOs (90 per cent KO rate)

Granite chin

Never been knocked down or out in 381 fights as an amateur or professional. Showed against big-hitting curtis Stevens in 2013 that he can take a punch.

Fists of steel

Knockout in each hand. Powerful jab but left hook to the body is the best in boxing. In last four fights his final blow was an overhand left, a right to jaw, a left to jaw and a left to body.

A body for fighting

No lifting of big weights. Training is geared around sparring and running, five miles at 7am each morning and sprint sessions three times a week. Trainer Abel Sanchez adds: 'No diet - just no sugars, fats or sodas.'

Punch power

His punches are not strictly conventional, blows coming from wide angles, many looping around the guard. Generates his power from this extra leverage.

Dancing feet

Excellent footwork. Fast and almost always balanced. Balance is also why he can ride some hefty blows when coming in. Expert at walking opponents into corners.

Aura of a master

Matthew Macklin, stopped in three in 2013, says: 'A master at getting you to burn nervous energy. He was bowling forward in second gear, I was darting backwards in fifth.'
