France's socialists were at the centre of a bitter anti-semitism row last night as a party grandee accused the Prime Minister of being 'under Jewish influence'.

Roland Dumas, the 92-year-old former foreign minister, said Prime Minister Manuel Valls was pushing a Jewish agenda because of family ties, especially when using terms such as 'Islamo-fascism.'

Mr Valls, who is married to a Jewish businesswoman, has been constantly speaking out against anti-semitism since terrorist attacks in January left 17 people dead, including four Jews.

But Mr Dumas said Mr Valls 'has personal alliances that mean he has prejudices. Everyone knows he is married to someone really good but who has an influence on him.'

Anne Gravoin, 49, Mr Valls's wife, is a high-profile entrepreneur, and also an accomplished violinist. 

Pressed to clarify his position on BFM TV, Mr Dumas was asked directly if Mr Valls was 'under Jewish influence', and Mr Dumas responded: 'Probably, I would think so'.

Such a claim fits in with dark conspiracy theories about a Jewish establishment controlling politicians and the media.

Distancing himself from such a view, a French Socialist party spokesman said Mr Dumas's statements were 'unworthy of a Socialist decorated by the Republic'.

Mr Valls, in turn, said he would be 'sullied' if he was to reply, adding that Mr Dumas was 'a man with a known past and his remarks which have done no credit to the Republic for a long time.'

Mr Dumas has, in the past, poured scorn on the official account of the terrorist attacks against America on 9/11 – September 11, 2001.

French President Francois Hollande has said the rise in anti-Jewish and Muslim acts threatens the country's very foundations.

He spoke today at a cemetery in Sarre-Union where more than 300 Jewish graves were desecrated over the weekend.

Mr Hollande noted anti-semitism and acts against Muslims are both on the rise in France.

He said anti-semitic acts doubled in 2014 compared with 2013, and acts against Muslims in just the month after the Charlie Hebdo attacks totalled the same for the entire previous year.

The president called on French Jews to remain in France and not follow Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's call for their mass emigration to his country.

It came as five youths were arrested in Sarre-Union, in the Bas-Rhin department of eastern France, under suspicion of desecrating more than 300 Jewish graves. 

The grave stones were vandalised by being kicked over, or had Nazi Swastikas daubed on them in red paint.

Mr Valls and French President Francois Hollande have been trying to reassure France's half a million Jews that the country is still their home after Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu issued a call for European Jews to move to Israel in the wake of Islamist attacks in Copenhagen and Paris.

Tensions are still high in France after a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris on January 9 in which four Jewish men died. 

It came two days after jihadist gunmen stormed the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the French capital, killing 12.
