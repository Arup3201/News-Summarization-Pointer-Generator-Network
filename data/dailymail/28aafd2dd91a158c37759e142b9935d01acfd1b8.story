Everton 

Midfielder Gareth Barry and full-back Seamus Coleman will undergo fitness tests ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.

Barry has an ankle problem which he suffered in Thursday's 3-0 Europa League win over Lille, while Coleman was absent from the squad for that match after suffering a cut to his Achilles tendon in last Saturday's 0-0 league draw with Swansea.

Kevin Mirallas (hamstring), Bryan Oviedo, Arouna Kone (both match fitness), Antolin Alcaraz (shoulder) and John Stones (ankle) remain unavailable for first-team selection.

Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Coleman, Baines, Hibbert, Browning, Jagielka, Distin, Gibson, McCarthy, Barry, Besic, Barkley, Osman, Pienaar, Atsu, McGeady, Lukaku, Eto'o, Naismith.
