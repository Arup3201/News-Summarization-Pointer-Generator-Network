A new report has found that young Australians are travelling farther, taking more trips abroad and receiving their passports at an earlier age than ever before.

Expedia's State of the Nation study has found that young Aussies, in the 18-24-year-old age bracket, are more likely than any other age group to have taken an international or domestic holiday in the last two years. 

The report questioned 2,567 Australians aged 18 and older and found that a massive 83% of them plan to take an international holiday in the next 12 months.

The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age.

This is a stark contrast to the average adult, who received their first passport at 17-years-old. 

Expedia 's State of the Nation study has found that young Aussies, in the 18-24-year-old age bracket, are more likely than any other age group to have taken an international or domestic holiday in the last two years

Currently more than half of the nation's youngsters aged 17 and under own a passport.  

'More than any generation before them, young Australians are seizing every opportunity to see the world, explore new destinations, enrich themselves with cultural experiences and meet locals in different lands, said Georg Ruebensal, Managing Director Expedia Australia and New Zealand. 

'They're travelling more and spending more than ever,' he said. 

Interestingly, metropolitan travellers have taken nearly one more international holiday in the past two years, than those living in the countryside.

The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age

They are 20% more likely to take an international holiday in the next year, and 30% more likely to travel overseas at least once a year, than their country counterparts.  

'Our data shows international air ticket prices have been declining by approximately 20% over the last three years, driven by low cost carriers and increased competition.

'Combine this with the rise in mobile device use, there is now more flexibility and choice than ever when planning and booking travel, and younger travellers are really taking advantage of this.' Mr Ruebensal said.

The study also reveals that Aussie parents rate beach holidays as the number one choice for a family holiday.

The Gold Coast has been rated as the number one domestic holiday destination in Australia for families with kids.

The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age. 

Parents travelling with kids are more likely to include an overnight stopover when travelling abroad.

When it comes to stopover destinations, Hawaii has been ranked as the place parents would most like to stay.
