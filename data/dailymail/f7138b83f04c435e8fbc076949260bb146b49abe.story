We've all been the victim of a delayed or cancelled flight, or had to desperately track down lost luggage, and it appears the stars as well are no strangers to airport woes. 

Actor John Barrowman had a miserable flying experience when dealing with Canadian airline, WestJet, yesterday and took to twitter to publicly vent his frustration.

If the vague message, 'how did you screw things up sooo badly?' was not clear enough, Barrowman included a unhappy thumbs-down selfie to express his displeasure to his 351,000 fans. 

The actor took to twitter to publicly express his frustration at the Canadian low-cost airline 

The low-cost carrier tweeted back enquiring about the problem, but Barrowman vaguely replied that the issue was too long to explain over Twitter and he did not get the service he paid for. 

WestJet Airlines replied asking for his number so someone could ring him to resolve the issue.

The Dr Who and Torchwood star said he was about to board the flight and he would be in touch after filming the next day. 

Barrowman, 48, is currently filming for US TV series Arrow, a modern retelling of the DC Comic character Green Arrow, where he plays crazed killer, Malcolm Merlyn.

A WestJet representative got in touch with Barrowman via twitter to resolve the matter but was told he would be in contact the next day 

Mysterious! Barrowman did not say what had occurred but said he would explain in more detail away from the public eye over the phone

The star could not resist a cheeky hashtag plug for his current US TV series role along with his complaint

Several people tweeted in defence of WestJet, including one woman who said that she is a frequent flyer and the airline has been close to perfection.

Barrowman replied saying he was 'not hating' and the matter was 'about principle and money'. 

Despite slamming the airline he stated he would use them again. 

MailOnline has contacted WestJet Airlines and Barrowman's representative for further comment.

Defenders of WestJet Airlines contacted Arrowman to sing their praises of the service, and the actor assured them he would still use them to fly

John Barrowman is best known for his roles in TV series Dr Who and Torchwood. Born in Glasgow, Scotland, he emigrated to the United States with his family in 1975
