A budget hotel is being used to accommodate patients at a leading London hospital in a bid to free up beds.

The Premier Inn in Hampstead is being used to house patients at the Royal Free Hospital - at a cost of £500,00 over the last two years.

Figures have revealed that the hospital’s use of the hotel as a makeshift ward has increased dramatically in less than three years.

The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead is putting patients up in a local Premier Inn, new figures have revealed

Due to pressure on beds, doctors at the Royal Free are being asked to assess whether patients need hospital-level care or whether they are well enough to stay in the hotel, the Ham&High reports.

Figures made available to the local paper revealed that in 2010 262 patients stayed at the Premier Inn.

In 2012 and 2013 the total figure was 1,900.

As a result, the cost of hotel rooms has risen from just over £40,000 in 2010 to more than £500,000 in 2012 and 2013 combined.

The hotel has confirmed that it has seen a ‘significant’ rise in the number of patients the hospital is sending to them.

Managers at the hotel, in Haverstock Hill, also explained that the rooms the hospital uses have no extra access to emergency equipment than any other room does.

Despite this, the Royal Free argues that the strategy does not affect the quality of care received by patients.

They say they offer hotel rooms purely for the convenience of patients who live a long way from the hospital so are not able to easily go home for the night.

A spokesperson said: ‘The Royal Free offers a range of specialist services and our patients travel from all over the UK to receive treatment.

'Some of the treatment will last more than one day, but overnight medical care is not required.

'For those patients living far from London, rather than ask them to travel home or have them stay in hospital overnight, we offer them a room in a nearby hotel.

'Patients might also be offered a room in a hotel if they have an operation scheduled very early in the morning.

The hotel, which Lenny Henry is the face of, said the rooms used for patients are no different to any other rooms. It said they contain no special equipment for patients

The hospital says only patients who are well enough not to need overnight care are offered a hotel room and that it means they get have a more comfortable night than they would in a hospital bed

'Only patients who do not need overnight 
care will be offered a room in a hotel and our staff always carefully 
assess patients before making this decision. This ensures patient safety
 is never compromised.

'The rise in patient hotel stays is due to a
 new approach we took, which included looking carefully at how and where
 patients were cared for to ensure they were receiving care in the most 
appropriate setting.

'We found that there were many patients who did not 
need to stay in hospital, for the reasons outlined above, and so we 
implemented new guidelines to ensure only patients in need of 24/7 
nursing care stay in wards overnight to free up hospital beds for those 
who need them.

'In addition, it means a more comfortable stay for 
patients who don’t need to be in hospital overnight.'
