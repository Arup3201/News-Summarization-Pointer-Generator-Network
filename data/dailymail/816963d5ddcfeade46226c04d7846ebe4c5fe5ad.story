A Scottish mountaineer who lost his hands and feet after developing severe frostbite while stranded in a blizzard which claimed the life of his friend has attempted to climb one of the most dangerous peaks in the Alps.

Jamie Andrew, of Edinburgh, had his limbs amputated after he and his climbing partner Jamie Fisher became stranded in a violent blizzard at the top of a mountain in the French Alps 15 years ago.

The pair were exposed to the elements for five days as they remained stuck on an icy ledge with no food or water.

Attempt: Jamie Andrews (pictured training for the initial attempt to climb the Matterhorn in 2011) has attempted to climb one of the most dangerous peaks in the Alps

Mountaineer: Mr Andrew (pictured during his attempt to climb the Matterhorn in August 2013) had his limbs amputated after he and his climbing partner became stranded in a violent blizzard at the top of a mountain in the French Alps 15 years ago

Mr Andrew was eventually rescued by helicopter but Mr Fisher had tragically frozen to death by the time they were found by the rescue services.

Mr Andrew was rushed to hospital with hypothermia where surgeons amputated his limbs due to the severe frostbite.

However, with the help of his prosthetics and physiotherapy, the 44-year-old learned to walk again and has since taken part in triathlons and marathons.

He has now taken on his biggest challenge by returning to the Alps region to attempt to climb the 14,692ft high Matterhorn mountain.

He said: 'The Matterhorn is actually just the wrong kind of climbing for me. If it was a bit steeper I could get my arms on to the rock and climb quickly.  If it was less steep I could use my trekking poles and walk upright. 

'As it is, I have to stumble from rock to rock, balancing as best I can, lunging with my arms to stop myself teetering back on my prosthetic legs.

Incredible journey: Mr Andrew learned to walk again with the help of his prosthetics and physiotherapy. He has since taken part in marathons and triathlons before he returned to mountaineering

Challenge: Jamie Andrews and Steve Jones, attempting to climb the Matterhorn in August 2013. The journey will be shown by Channel 5 next month in their film The Limbless Mountaineer

Ordeal: Mr Andrew (pictured training for the 2011 attempt) had his limbs amputated after he and his climbing partner became stranded in a violent blizzard at the top of a mountain in the French Alps 15 years ago

Difficult climb: Mr Andrew (pictured during his attempt to climb the Matterhorn last year) said: 'Hopefully I have done my part to push back the boundaries of what disabled people can achieve'

Preparation: Mr Andrew and his climbing partner Steve Jones plan their strategy for climbing the Matterhorn

'It’s back-breaking work. The terrain is incredibly broken and it is impossible for me to keep up any pace.

'But if there’s one thing I’ve learned in life it’s that bravery is not always about taking tough challenges, but about taking tough decisions.'

Mr Andrew was initially due to take on the challenge before last year, but the attempt had to be cancelled after his partner Roger Payne, one of Britain’s leading climbers, was killed in an avalanche in 2012.

Mr Andrews' journey will be shown by Channel 5 next month in their film The Limbless Mountaineer.

He said: 'Hopefully I have done my part to push back the boundaries of what disabled people can achieve, and Channel 5’s The Limbless Mountaineer is an edifying documentary about the journey.'

Brave: Mr Andrew (pictured training for the earlier attempt) was rushed to hospital after he was rescued from the blizzard in 1999, but doctors were forced to amputate his limbs

Climb: Mr Andrew described the Matterhorn as 'the wrong kind of climbing for me' as it was too steep to use trekking poles but too flat to allow him to climb quickly

Impressive: Mr Andrew described the climb as 'back-breaking work'. He said: 'The terrain is incredibly broken and it is impossible for me to keep up any pace'

Paul Crompton, executive produce for 5Production, said: 'Working with Jamie was nothing but inspirational.

'He's not just a man on a mission he's also a true gent. It was a delight to spend almost two years with him making this film.'

Jason Wells, Channel 5 Commissioning Executive: Factual and Factual Entertainment, said: 'I think Jamie’s unbelievable tenacity in the face of crippling injury is an inspiration to us all and shows how the human spirit can overcome the most challenging obstacles life throws at it. 

'His positive outlook, wife and children have kept him reaching for bigger and bigger goals, and the 5Production team have captured the spirit of his steadfastness to not be stopped by his disabilities.'
