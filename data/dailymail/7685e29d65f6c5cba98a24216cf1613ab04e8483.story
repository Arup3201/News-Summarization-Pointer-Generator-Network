Rio Ferdinand is being considered as the FA’s candidate for British vice-president on FIFA’s executive, which would make him the first playing member of world football’s most important committee.

QPR defender Ferdinand is one of four past and present footballers — the others being David James, Graeme Le Saux and Paul Elliott — who are in the FA’s thoughts for the post.

This is because UEFA executive member David Gill, the most obvious successor when Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce steps down next year, does not want to work with a regime led by Sepp Blatter, who is certain to be re-elected for a fifth term as FIFA president in 2015.

The FA have no plan B in place for another contender from the other Home Nations to face competition for the British vice-presidency in a vote at the UEFA Congress in Vienna in March.

So FA general secretary Alex Horne, who rules out himself and FA chairman Greg Dyke from standing due to their current commitments, is sensibly examining other options. And putting forward such a big-name player as Ferdinand would go down well with UEFA president Michel Platini, who wants to see more players on committees.

Meanwhile, another problem to be faced is that FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes believes there is a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ in place for Wales to fill the next British VP seat at FIFA as they are the only Home Nation never to have done so before.

But the FA claim any such contract — and Wales say they have a signed paper — is now null and void following recent reforms in which the four Home Nations preserve their law-making roles on the international FA Board, while all 54 European countries will vote in future on Britain’s FIFA vice-presidency.

There are six broadcast and newspaper journalists being interviewed this week for the job of BBC sports editor, which the Beeb have yet to get anywhere near right. A strong set of candidates come from BBC, Sky, ITV and national newspapers. The interview panel were split between wanting a talking head or a news-getter, but the make-up of the shortlist suggests the preference will be for finding stories rather than waffling across outlets.

Paul's expensive taste

Following FIFA’s fuss over the gifts of ultra-expensive watches at the World Cup, there’s never been any questions asked about each member of the European Ryder Cup team receiving a pricey, specially engraved Rolex watch chosen by the captain. This time Paul McGinley has gone for a steel GMT-2 priced at around £7,500.

Football powerbrokers Greg ‘six-watch’ Dyke and Michel Platini both gave the impression at the Euro 2020 venue summit in Geneva that everyone on the sports circuit — including the media — get expensive gifts all the time.

It should be noted the press freebies at the Ryder Cup this week consist of a tartan credit card holder, a notebook and a box of chocolates, as opposed to the £16,400 Parmigianis in Dyke and Platini’s goodie bags at the FIFA Congress.

The Ryder Cup schedule details just one hour and 10 minutes from the estimated end of play next Sunday before the winning team appears in the media centre for interviews. This should at least ensure the triumphant players are rather less tired and emotional than they were at Medinah in 2012. It was three hours after the winning putt before they arrived and they were far more concerned about carrying on celebrating than facing the press.

Both Ryder Cup captains, Tom Watson and Paul McGinley, whose love-in on Monday hopefully won’t continue all week, are leaving it to their players to decide when it is appropriate to tweet from Gleneagles — a high-risk tactic when such a savvy tweeter as Gary Lineker caused controversy for using the F-word when his club Leicester beat Manchester United.

Meanwhile, McGinley says he has measures in place to ensure none of his team arrive on the course 11 minutes before their tee-off time, as Rory McIlroy did at Medinah. But fortunately for Rory, it would take about that time to reach the first tee on the Centenary Course from his Gleneagles Hotel bed.
