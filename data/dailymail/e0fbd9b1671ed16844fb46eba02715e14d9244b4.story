The images we're used to seeing present a much more austere country, with the rare displays of bright colours, fanfare and celebration  reserved for extolling Dear Leader.

But a new set of photographs reveals the fun and optimism of a day at the Kaeson Youth Amusement Park in the North Korean capital. 

Perched on psychedelic spinning rides, the city's residents appear fancy-free with wide smiles and heads flung back.

It's a very different picture to what we've seen before. 

Few foreign tourists visit the regimented country and there are tough restrictions to what can and can't be photographed. 

In fact, Kim Jong-un this week accused a planned UK television series about a British scientist who's kidnapped by Pyongyang of 'malignantly slandering the DPRK'.

The North Korean government demanded the British government axe the project 'without delay and punish the chief culprits'.

'This would help prevent any hurt to the image of the UK and preserve the hard-won diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Britain,' a statement warned.

But as these images show, there is more to the country than meets the eye.

The Kaeson Youth Park is an Amusement Park, which opened in 1984, is located near the Kim II Sung Stadium and Moran Hill. 

It contains a carousel, fun house, and rides such as a Ferris wheel, bumper cars, teacups, a swing ride and a vertical drop slide.
