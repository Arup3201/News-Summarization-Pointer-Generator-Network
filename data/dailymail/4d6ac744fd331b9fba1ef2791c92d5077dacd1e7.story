Young Polish refugee Michael Marks opened the stall at Leeds Kirkgate market in 1884

It's a brand that has become synonymous with luxury - but Marks & Spencer is going back to basics by opening a stall on the market where it was founded almost 130 years ago.

The retailer will set up a heritage 
and coffee shop in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, in March, the city council 
said today.

It will display the heritage of the brand since its start as
a penny bazaar in a similar stall and will sell coffee, M&S branded
gifts and merchandise.

The new stall will coincide with the 
one-year anniversary of the opening of the Marks in Time Exhibition at 
the M&S Company Archive.

The collection details the history and development of the retail chain from its roots in the market to the present day.

The stall will be set up in the same spot as the one young Polish refugee Michael Marks claimed at Leeds Kirkgate market in 1884.

Marks arrived in the North East of England in 1882. In 1884, as a travelling pedlar, he borrowed  £5 from Isaac Dewhirst to buy stock for his tray and by the end of the year he had a stall at Leeds Kirkgate open market.

This is not the first time M&S have looked to their roots for marketing ideas.

Back in May and November 2009 celebrated
125 years in business by holding Penny Bazaars in 350 stores across the
country where they sold a selection of 15 items for just a penny with 
proceeds going to charity.

Alison Houston, head of the M&S 
company archive, said: 'The new stall will give visitors the chance to 
experience the origins and history of Marks & Spencer right inside 
its original setting at Kirkgate Market.

'This
is a unique opportunity for people in Leeds to learn more about the 
heritage of a world-famous company born within the city 128 years ago 
and its links with various parts of the city centre from 1884 through to
the present day.'

Work has started preparing the unit for the launch of the stall.

Councillor Richard Lewis, of Leeds 
City Council, said: 'We are really pleased to have a Marks & Spencer
stall back in Kirkgate market where Michael Marks opened the famous 
penny bazaar.

'The brand has its heritage based in Leeds, and it is a fantastic example of the retail capability of Leeds as a city.'

Kirkgate Market claims to be one of the biggest in Europe.

It opened in the 1820s as an open-air market, with roofed sections being built in stages in the late 1800s.

The ornate, neo-Gothic 1904 Hall - arguably the grandest part of the market - will house the new Marks & Spencer stall.

The full range of Christmas Penny 
Bazaar products in November 2009 included two kinds of festive socks, card 
games, children's puzzles, two kinds of handkerchiefs, money boxes, 
tea-towels, mugs, notebooks, ties, knickers, key-rings, Christmas 
chocolates and Yule logs.

Customers were restricted to just five items each and every penny raised
went to local charities nominated by each of the more than 350 
participating stores.

In May the Penny Bazaar initiative raised over 
£200,000 for charity.
