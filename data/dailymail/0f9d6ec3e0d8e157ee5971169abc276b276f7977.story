As fearless boys do back-flips near their village of Nghiem Xuyen in Vietnam, novice Buddhist monks in Myanmar show their balancing skills on what is dubbed the 'perfect playground', Hsinbyume Pagoda. 

Meanwhile, daredevil boys climb the main minaret of the Grand Mosque in Bani, Burkina Faso, seemingly oblivious to what could happen if they slip.

These incredible scenes of youthful frolicking from around the globe feature among incredible wildlife, serene landscapes and natural wonders that make up the finalists in Smithsonian's 12th Annual Photo Contest.
