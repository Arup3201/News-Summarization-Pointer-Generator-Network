So the trademark white collar might be long gone, but the new All Blacks strip appears to be a hit with the players. 

After two years in the making the new outfit was revealed on Tuesday night and will be worn for the first time as they stride out against England at Twickenham this weekend.

Team captain Richie McCaw said the new strip was a hit with the players, who were also involved at various stages during the kit's development to assist in measuring player movement and shape.

 'The boys love it,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 

'I think it looks awesome. I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to a rugby jersey, but it looks like a rugby jersey, and it's black, the blackest we've ever had in fact, and it feels pretty good on.'

But that is not all. Due to the differing requirements of both forwards and backs, adidas created specific shirts for each position, which was a popular decision.

'The big boys need to be able to grip in the scrums, then you've got the backs who don't need to do that, so they want it as tight as possible so the other team can't get hold of it.'

'The team have always said that fit is what's most important to the players, so it's great to have two different jerseys for the forwards and backs.'
