Five year-old Amelia Abbott can’t stop dancing and with very good reason – she has just been declared cancer free and finally returned home after three and a half months in hospital battling leukemia.

Amelia's mum Michelle told Daily Mail Australia that there were no words to express how she was feeling.

'It has been a magical journey and the strength and joy I have enabled to embrace with my children has been priceless.' 

The most exciting part of returning to the Gold Coast in Queensland on Friday was seeing her three-year-old brother, Lachy, who saved her life by donating his identical bone marrow match to his eternally grateful sister.

The inseparable pair were over the moon to be back together again after only being able to catch up on weekends when Lachy would visit Amelia in Brisbane where she was in isolation for 100 days.

'It has been a magical journey and the strength and joy I have enabled to embrace with my children has been priceless,' said Amelia's mum Michelle

Their mother Michelle Abbott said it was the perfect welcome home gift after such a long and rough journey.

‘He didn’t know she was coming home when he walking in the door and saw her and just ran up and embraced her,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘He just loves his sister so much.’ 

Amelia and her mother were elated when they received the good news that she was cancer free and could finally return home.

'Amelia just looked up with the biggest grin on her face and I said “did you hear that baby?” And she said “I heard!” – she just got so excited,’ Ms Abbott said.

‘We are both just dancing to the moon and back – she does this little dance and she yells “I’m so excited! I’m so excited!”.’ 

There was a 25 per cent chance of Lachy being a bone marrow match for Amelia who was in desperate need of a helping hand after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a type of blood cancer which particularly hits children.

So when Lachy provided a very rare 'ten out ten match' with his sibling it was a moment his mum Michelle described as nothing short of 'magical'.

‘It was just awesome – we were just ecstatic to know Lachy was able to help her to heal and be a part of her journey,’ she said.

Amelia fell in the low risk category when she was diagnosed in December but after three months of chemotherapy, she rapidly escalated to extremely high risk with just a 40 per cent chance of recovery.

‘I was glad I was sitting down when I got the news – I was absolutely beside myself,’ she said.

But the best possible news was delivered to the family in March when Lachy had an unusual 10 out of 10 bone marrow match with his sister. 

'I did have a mother's instinct that he would be a match, but it was amazing when the news came,' Michelle said.

‘It was just awesome – we were just ecstatic to know Lachy was able to help her to heal and be a part of her journey.' 

The way Michelle and her husband Chris explained to their three-year-old son that he was going to be the unique gift to Amelia was by reading him a book.

'We sat down and explained to him with a superhero story, and he thought it was an awesome story, she said.  

Lachy had 280ml of barrow marrow removed, which was transplanted into Amelia just a few hours later on July 9. Amazingly, his young body has replaced this marrow within a few weeks.

‘He woke and all he wanted to do was see Amelia, but she was in isolation so he waved at her through the window,’ she said.

When the pair reunited five weeks later, Michelle was glad to have her camera on hand to capture the heart-warming moment.

The huge grin on Amelia’s face spoke a million words when she held her little brother.

‘He ran into the room and they just embraced,’ she said. ‘They don’t go well when they don’t see each other for a while.’

Only 17 months apart in age, Amelia and Lachy have always had a close relationship which has significantly strengthened since the beginning of this special journey.

Michelle says her son and daughter have a bond as strong as twins

‘She has always been like his little mother since he was born and he’s her strength – they are more like twins,’ she said.

‘And now they have a bond that will never be broken – it has been magical to watch it grow.’ 

When Michelle and her husband, Chris, had to tell Amelia who was only four at the time, that she was sick, they decided to break it down in a way she would easily understand.

‘I told her that the chemo was Pacman, who had to eat the nasties inside her,’ she said.

There are currently about 175,000 bone marrow donors registered and the majority are categorised as North West European Caucasian.

Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry operations manager Garth Healey said there is a desperate need for more ethnic diversity from people who register - with 70 per cent of possible donors fitting this genetic mould across the world.

‘We don’t have many Indonesian, Malaysian or Sri Lankan donors because they don’t have registries in their countries,’ he said. ‘We would also love to get more Indigenous Australians.’

Of the people known to have needed a bone marrow transplant about 30 per cent do not find a donor from either their family or from an unrelated donor.

The registry only takes unrelated donors aged between 18 and 45-years-old and they are taken off the registry once the person turns 60.

‘Evidence shows the younger the donor - the better the outcome for patients,’ Mr Healey said. ‘We are always looking for people in their 20s.’

Since 2003, the amount of Australian patients searching the registry for an unrelated bone marrow donor has risen from 310 to 660.

‘This is mainly due to there being more unrelated transplant hospitals in Australia since 2003 and the increase of people needing a transplant,’ Mr Healey said.

Amelia has a very sound understanding of the incredible gift she has been given by her brother Lachy

But when the chemotherapy wasn't successful, they had another chat with their daughter about her brother helping out.

Her instant response proved her extraordinary understanding of a complex situation for a child who had not yet turned five.

‘Pacman is not doing a good enough job so Lachy’s super cells are going in to help. But Pacman is still on guard to help kill them off if they come back,’ Amelia told her parents.

'She’s an intelligent young girl,’ her mother said. ‘She’s my strength and always has positivity.’

‘She says “I’ll get those nasties” – it’s been an amazing journey.’

Six weeks after her transplant, Amelia was given the all clear for the first time.

She had her 100-day test on Thursday and expects to receive the results early next week.

Amelia’s family and friends participated in the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland’s Light the Night 2014 at Broadwater Parklands, Marine Pde in Southland, Queensland on Wednesday.
