The widening gap between
America's wealthiest and its middle and lower classes is
'unsustainable', but is unlikely to improve any time soon,
according to a Harvard Business School study released on Monday.

American companies, especially big ones, were showing some signs of recovering their competitive edge on the world stage since the financial crisis, but workers are continuing to struggle to demand better pay and benefits, according to the study, titled, 'An Economy Doing Half its Job'.

The report focuses on this 'troubling divergence' between the rally at large and mid-size firms and the challenge smaller companies and middle- and working-class Americans are having keeping up.

This graph from the Harvard study shows almost half of respondents to its survey forecast falling competitiveness over the coming three years

Although a plurality of respondents remain pessimistic about the US' prospects, the percentage has dropped significantly from recent surveys

Overall the survey showed improvement in every measure of the US business environment from prior years

'We argue that such a divergence is unsustainable,' lead authors Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin write in the report, which was based on a survey of 1,947 of
Harvard Business School alumni around the globe, and which
highlighted problems with the US education system, transport
infrastructure and the effectiveness of the political system.

'How can we create a US economy in which firms both thrive in global competition and lift the living standards of the average America?' the study's authors ask in the executive summary. 

Some 47 per cent of respondents in the survey said that overthe next three years they expected US companies to be bothless competitive internationally and less able to pay higherwages and benefits, versus 33 per cent who thought the opposite. 

That contrasts with the more troubling trends in the labor market and among middle- and working-class Americans

The job market for younger Americans is particularly troubled, with the share of 'mal-employed' college graduates soaring in recent years

The results marked an improvement from a 2012 Harvard
Business School survey of its alumni showing 58 per cent of
respondents expecting a decline in US competitiveness,
according to the survey.

In K-12 education, business is mostly involved in fragmented, subscale efforts that alleviate weaknesses in the system without strengthening it for the long run.

In workplace skills, firms tend to hire in ways that discourage skills investments; information flows poorly along the 'supply chain' for talent; and there is inadequate collaboration among companies, educational institutions and government.

In transportation infrastructure, there is no national strategy for increasing both the nation's mobility and the opportunity that accompanies it.  

The change from 2011 was even more stark, when 71 per cent forecast a decline.  

Respondents were more favorable in every element of the US business environment, reflecting the cyclical rebound of the economy, the authors said.

Smaller gains were seen in areas that pose 'some of the nation's toughest challenges', including the tax code, the education system, the political system and regulations.

But the authors of the Harvard survey noted that respondents of the 2014 survey 'were much
more hopeful about the future competitive success of America's
firms than they were about the future pay of America's workers'.

Alumni reported weakness in areas that drive the prospects of middle- and working-class Americans, such as in education, the quality of workplace skills and the effectiveness of the political system.

Household incomes in the lower and middle classes have remained stagnant in inflation-adjusted terms for decades, while private sector job growth rates are subdued, the authors said.

This chart shows the areas where the US is seen as improving relative to other advanced economies and areas where its standing is deteriorating, and how it's changed from prior surveys

They called on corporate leaders to help solve America's
wealth gap by working to buttress the kindergarten-to-12th-grade
 education system, skills-training programs, and transportation
infrastructure, among other things.

'Shortsighted executives may be satisfied with an American
economy whose firms win in global markets without lifting US living standards. But any leader with a long view understands
that business has a profound stake in the prosperity of the
average American,' according to the report.

'Thriving citizens become more productive employees, more
willing consumers, and stronger supporters of pro-business
policies,' it said. 'Struggling citizens are disgruntled at
work, frugal at the cash register, and anti-business at the
ballot box.'

The study highlights the US economy's slow recovery, record corporate profits and the growing confidence among business leaders. 

The authors noted, however, that American's international competitiveness is linked to high and rising living standards among average citizens. If they fall, then so too will the US' place in the world. 

'But oddly, the recovery makes this a decisive moment, and potentially a dangerous one,' the authors said. 'Will we as a society now sigh in relief and continue business as usual, grateful for calmer waters? Or will we seize the opportunity to repair the structural weaknesses in our economy that the storms revealed and that, arguably, brought on recent troubles and may bring them on again?'
