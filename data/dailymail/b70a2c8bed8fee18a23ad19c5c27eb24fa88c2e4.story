A naked man led police on a two-hour game of cat and mouse around a city lake yesterday after he attacked two teenagers.

The heavily-bearded man approached Daniel Gonzalez, 19, and his 16-year-old sister from behind and wrestled them to the ground in Green Lake Park in Seattle, Washington, police said.

Onlookers said the 32-year-old man, who was then clothed, shouted 'Don't do that!' as he ran towards them.

Cat and mouse: A naked man evades police during a two-hour chase around a lake in Seattle, Washington, yesterday after he 'attacked' two teenagers

Unwilling: The heavily-bearded man approached Daniel Gonzalez, 19, and his 16-year-old sister from behind and wrestled them to the ground in Green Lake Park, police said

Pursuit: Two police boats follow the man as the try and coax him out of the water

Bettye Atkinson, 61, was walking behind the teenagers when the incident happened.

She told the Seattle Times: 'The guy 
came out of the trees like a linebacker. There was no warning 
whatsoever. He could sprint like you wouldn't believe.'

One witness to the alleged assault, 
which saw Gonzalez sustain a broken finger and his sister minor 
injuries, dialled 911 and monitored the man until police arrived.

But when he saw the responding 
officers approach, the man threw his sleeping bag at them, jumped into 
Green Lake and removed his clothes.

He then swam to the centre of the lake, held onto a buoy and refused to come out.

Delicate operation: The man swam to Duck Island (top), where he might have got out of the water for a time

The man eventually climbed aboard a boat and was wrapped in a blanket as he was taken back to shore

Taking no chances: Police throw a lifebuoy to the man, which he held onto for a while before discarding it

Police in two small boats spent 
almost two hours trying to talk him into giving himself up. The 
operation included a crisis intervention officer, divers and Harbor 
Patrol.

The man swam to Duck Island, where he
might have got out of the water for a short time, and even swam under 
his pursuers' boats to evade arrest.

At one point, he pushed a police boat
away while an officer was in the water beside him. He also discarded a 
lifebuoy that officers had thrown at him.

Victim: Daniel Gonzalez said that he and his sister were assaulted in an unprovoked attack

Wounded: Mr Gonzalez sustained a broken finger and facial injuries during the attack

Eventually, the man climbed aboard a boat and was wrapped in a blanket as he was taken back to shore.

There, an ambulance took him to Harborview Medical Center for evaluation.

The victims were taken by their father, Jesus Gonzalez, to the same hospital.

He said: 'You don't expect to see 
that here. You see women, children and families around usually, but not a
guy like that. He was a creepy creature.'
