Turkish newspaper Bugun has mocked  Arsene Wenger's for his post-match rage after his Arsenal side drew 0-0 away at Besiktas in the Champions League qualifier.

The paper described Wenger as 'livid' after midfielder Aaron Ramsey was sent off, and showed him frowning with a blue face. 

The Spanish papers have focused on last night's Super Cup clash between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid, which ended 1-1 and saw James Rodriguez score his first goal for Real.
