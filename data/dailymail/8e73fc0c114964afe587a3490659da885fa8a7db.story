Great Britain's women capped a record-breaking European Championships by securing the 4x100 metres crown with a new national record.

The British team will return home with 23 medals - four better than the previous best set in Barcelona four years ago - and a remarkable 12 golds.

That haul blew away the previous record of nine set in Budapest in 1998 and came thanks to a golden last day in Zurich.

The men's 4x400m relay team got the ball rolling, before London 2012 stars Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford triumphed either side of the men's 4x100m team.

Asha Philip, Ashleigh Nelson, Jodie Williams and Desiree Henry added a fifth gold of a wonderful Sunday for the British team by romping to victory in the women's 100m relay.

In the last event on the Stadion Letzigrund track, they crossed the line in a European-leading time of 42.24 seconds, breaking the national record in the process.

All smiles: The women's triumph completed a golden Sunday for Britain, with five wins achieved 

'I'm so happy,' Philip said. 'We've been talking about the record for so long and wanted it so badly.

'I am so proud of these girls because we worked so hard for it. We deserve this, we fought for it.'

Team-mate Jodie Williams, fresh from winning 200m gold in Zurich, echoed those sentiments.

'We've been looking for this national record this whole Championships,' she told the BBC.

'Everyone has been talking about how British sprinting has come on in the last year and I think we've proved that in the relays with the medals we've got.'
