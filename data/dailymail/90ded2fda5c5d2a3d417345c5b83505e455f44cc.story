With its white spiderweb design and 18 rotors humming gently, it looks like it was plucked straight from a science fiction book.

This is the world's first electric two-seater helicopter, which could soon be flying over your house after online investors raised £1 million in just three days.

Instead of a traditional combustion engine, it uses an battery pack on the back of the aircraft to power the 18 rotors arranged on top.

Sci-fi: With its 18 rotors and spiderweb pattern, the Volocopter looks like it was plucked from fiction

Eco-friendly: It is the world's first two-seater helicopter to be powered purely by electricity, and much quieter

Lift-off! The inventors celebrated last month as it made its maiden flight. Since then they have raised £1m

Technology: When completed the Volocopter will be able to fly up to 6,500ft weighing not more than 450kg

Flight of fancy: Although the maiden flight was unmanned, the inventors hope to get people on board soon

Its inventors say it will be the most environmentally-friendly helicopter ever created.

They also claim it will be the world's safest because it is unlikely to crash if a rotor fails.

The design is so unusual that authorities in Germany, where it is being developed, have had to invent a new class of aircraft for it to get a license to fly.

When the Volocopter VC200 is completed, it will be able to fly at 6,500ft for up to an hour weighing a maximum of 450kg including crew and kit, about half the weight of a Nissan Micra.

After the successful test flight last month, inventors Thomas Senkel, Alexander Zosel and Stephan Wolf put out
 an online plea before Christmas for money from internet investors.

Their 'crowdfunding' attempt on the website seedmatch.de was so successful it smashed all records in Germany - earning them 500,000 Euros in just two and a half hours.

By the time they reached their total of 1.2 million Euros (£1m) in three days, nine hours and 52 minutes, they had been handed money by 750 different investors ranging from 250 to 10,000 Euros.

Coming to Britain? Anyone with a pilot's license can fly the craft, which is being primed for mass production

Mr Zosel, the managing director of E-Volo, the firm behind the aircraft, said: 'There are already numerous requests for the Volocopter 
from around the world.

'The money raised will now serve to 
optimize the first prototype of the VC200 and, as part of the testing 
scheme, conclude a comprehensive test flight program for this new 
aviation category.

'After that, we will build a weight-optimized 
prototype of the VC200 [to prepare for mass production].

'With
 multiple flights lasting several minutes reaching the nearly 22m [72ft] high 
ceiling, including a number of smooth takeoffs and landings, the 
Volocopter concept exceeded all expectations.

'The result of the first flight created a euphoria among the entire project team.'

The idea has been several years in the planning and previously won a 2 million Euro (£1.7m) grant from Germany's federal ministry of economics and technology.

Test flights were conducted in Karlsruhe, Germany, including of a 16-rotor prototype last year with room for just one brave pilot.

Prototype: A test version of the helicopter last year had room for just one precariously-placed pilot

For the test version, the VC1, the pilot had to sit in the open air on top of a metal ball containing the batteries

Soaring success: The Volocopter's inventors celebrate after their prototype made its maiden flight

Weighing just 80kg including the batteries, it was so small that the helmet-wearing pilot had to sit in the open air between the blades strapped into a tiny chair.

Anyone with a private pilot's licence in Germany will be able to fly the revolutionary aircraft once it hits the mass market.

Its inventors claim it is also simpler to fly than a traditional helicopter, with just one joystick controlling almost every aspect of flight.

The project has been handed a provisional airworthiness certificate and its inventors hope it will get the sign-off from aviation authorities in the near future.

A statement by the firm said: 'The Volocopter is an absolutely novel aircraft which cannot be assigned to any existing aviation category.

'The greatest challenge after 
technical realisation is to be able to place such an aircraft on the 
market.'
