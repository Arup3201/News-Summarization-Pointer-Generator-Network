For Ally McCoist, a brief period when football dominated the agenda at Rangers came to an abrupt halt on Friday.

Two hours before the Ibrox manager conducted a 9am press briefing at Murray Park, a statement to the Stock Exchange spelled out the precarious financial position at the club.

The launch of a new share issue is intended to raise £4million to provide a stop-gap injection of funds. An uptake of at least £3m is required for it to go ahead.

Concern: Ally McCoist is worried about the club's perilous finances and the prospect of administration

Should that fail to happen, said the release from the board, then ‘the company will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the company will be uncertain. The directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available’.

Those were words to chill supporters. 

Ibrox sources discount the possibility of a second administration, pointing out that the only two creditors are shareholders Sandy Easdale and George Letham, who provided £1.5m in loans last season.

In the event of non-repayment, they would be granted security over the Albion car park and Edmiston House facilities at Ibrox.

Others, though, are not so certain. Having bubbled away in the background while the fluctuating form of McCoist’s team drew attention, monetary worries are once again front and centre at Rangers.

McCoist has been down this particular road many times. 

Ever since the cracks began to appear in Craig Whyte’s scandalous tenure almost three years ago, he has been confronted by a variety of looming off-field crises.

It was with a certain weariness, therefore, that he insisted he would only answer questions relating to football matters.

But even those issues are far from immune from the wider situation. With the transfer window closing on Monday night, Rangers look decidedly vulnerable to offers for any of their key players.

Could the board reject an even half-decent offer for stalwart left-back Lee Wallace or precocious midfielder Lewis Macleod?

McCoist hopes there will be no need to learn the answer to that question as he expressed his desire to keep together a squad seeking to gain promotion from the Championship at the first attempt.

Asked if he was confident bids could be turned down, the Ibrox boss said: ‘I would obviously hope so as a manager. If I’m happy with my squad then you don’t want to see it being depleted.

‘But I do know what’s involved in football and I know that sometimes people make decisions that can alter your squad. That’s part and parcel of football.

‘I would hope that no bids come in for any of the players. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens.

‘If we did lose someone we’d just have to regroup and get on with it. As I say, I’m not expecting to lose anyone. I’m expecting to go with the squad we’ve got and hopefully that’s the case.’

McCoist said he had not been informed by chief executive Graham Wallace of a need to sell during their discussions. He had previously hoped some squad movement might allow him to augment his midfield options but that now appears a non-starter.

Saturday's home game against Queen of the South, unbeaten so far in the Championship, will restore football to prominence for 90 minutes or so. It will be interesting to see whether further supporter dissent is aired against the board, but McCoist doesn’t expect an impact on his players.

‘Our supporters have been fantastic in handling everything that has been thrown at them,’ he said.

‘We’ve sold 23,000 season tickets and, say what you like, that is fantastic support for us. As long as the team continue to give them everything that they can in terms of their effort and attempt to play in the right manner and win games, then the fans will stick by the team 100 per cent.’

The concern felt among many supporters was made clear, however, by a stinging retort from the Union of Fans to the Stock Exchange statement.

They attacked the lack of investment progress since last December’s AGM and questioned why more had not been done to facilitate Dave King’s involvement.

The South African-based businessman rejected an approach to underwrite the £4m share issue, apparently through unhappiness about the conditions.

He has previously expressed a desire to invest up to £30m in Rangers in return for significant boardroom influence. Such a move would, though, require shareholder approval and dilute the existing power base.

‘The board’s inaction and incompetence over the past nine months has led the club once again into an extremely precarious financial position which could easily have been avoided,’ said the Union of Fans.

‘Graham Wallace and the other board members have known for at least nine months that significant levels of investment were required not only to see out the current season but also to invest properly in the club. 

'They have also been, or should have been, well aware that this level of investment would not be raised from current shareholders and that only those with a genuine love for the club were willing to put such sums in.

‘They have continually refused to take the necessary steps to allow those outside the existing shareholder base to invest the funds required. Indeed, they have continued to pursue every option to keep those people out.

‘They now hang the threat of a second administration over the heads of both fans and shareholders when they remain fully aware that funding can be brought in from outside. For the avoidance of doubt, if this board would finally start to do their job properly, there can be absolutely no threat of administration. A £30m funding package has been available for at least the past seven months and remains available.’

The statement added: ‘Fans and shareholders should not be blackmailed into servicing this board.

‘They are doing everything in their power to keep those who care about the club from having any control over its destiny.

‘We ask them to finally do the right thing, stop putting their own positions and salaries ahead of the welfare of the club, gain shareholder approval for significant, much-needed investment and allow those who care about Rangers to take it back to where it belongs.’
