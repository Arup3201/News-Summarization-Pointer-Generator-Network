Arguably the performance of the night came from Jazz Carlin of Wales, who produced a brilliant swim to win the 800m freestyle and cement her place as the natural British heir to double Olympic gold-winner Becky Adlington over that distance.

Carlin won in a time of 8min 18.11sec, which would have been good enough for a silver medal in the same event at London 2012, which she missed out on. The winner there was the American prodigy Katie Ledecky, 15 at the time, with Adlington in third.

Carlin beat Lauren Boyle of New Zealand on to the silver step of the podium last night with Brittany MacLean of  Canada third. Most importantly, this was the first Games gold for a Welsh woman in 40 years — and only their second ever.

In full flow: Carlin broke her own Commonwealth Games record on her way to victory

In attendance to see her win it, and then collect her medal, were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry. The Duke was formerly known as William Wales when at university in Scotland and he sang every single word of the Welsh anthem, Land of My Fathers, here in Scotland last night.

Carlin wept tears of joy on the podium at her third Commonwealth Games at the age of 23. Her struggles on the route to her triumph included missing London 2012, and then discovering in January her long-time American coach, Bud McAllister, was leaving Britain.

Near-misses at big events, including fourth place in the 400m at the world championships in Barcelona last year due to an ill-timed finish, have also spurred her on.

‘I missed out on the London Olympics, I was really ill,’ she said. ‘I had glandular fever and it was a really tough time.

‘When you have failures and tough times, it makes the highs so much better.

‘Obviously I got pipped to fourth place at the world championships, got pipped in the last 50m, so this year, every race I’ve competed in I’ve made sure that I’ve got the strongest last 50m in the pool.

‘I knew in that race tonight that nobody was going to come back as hard and as fast as me. It was something I’ve been working on.’
