A park ranger known for his dancing has been fired after a video emerged of him performing an 'R-rated' version of the Macarena.

Deryl Nelson from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was captured holding his crouch during the routine, causing parents to cover their childrens' eyes.

The 51-year-old had worked at Coolidge Park in North Shore for seven years and was known for being the 'dancing ranger', but city officials accused him of neglecting his duties and 'unbecoming conduct' after they noticed the video online.

Routine: Deryl Nelson, 51, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, has been fired from his job as a park ranger after the 'R-rated' dance was caught on camera

Career: He has been working at Coolidge Park for seven years, but officials removed him from his post after accusing him of neglecting his duties and 'unbecoming conduct'

A visitor to the park did not see the funny side of his antics, complained, and posted the video online

The mother who recorded the footage, Melissa Parsons, told WTVC: 'As a parent and seeing all the parents that were covering their kids’ eyes and turning their heads away, it wasn't something that you would expect to see in Coolidge Park or anywhere from a grown man, especially a man in uniform.'

His records show that he was disciplined for making an 'unwelcome comment' to an employee and hitting a car, but has never been flagged up for dancing.

'It's all about enjoying what you do and that's the way I feel,' he said. 

'Clean fun. It's nothing like doing any bumping and grinding. People just have nothing else to do but bash people. No twerks, no jerking, no nothing.'

He added that he dances in front of people to bring a smile to their face.

Deeanna Demian, a park patron, said: 'Sad. I mean somebody's trying to have fun and entertain people and they get fired for doing that. I don't understand.'

An online petition set up in a bid to reinstate the park ranger has already reached 1,000 signatures.

Officials, who saw the video when it was posted online, said they do not comment on 'personal matters'.
