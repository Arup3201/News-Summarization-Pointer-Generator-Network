Sean Roberts, 14, has been suspended from classes at Wellington Academy, Wiltshire, and told he must attend the school¿s ¿department for naughty kids¿

A boy has been suspended from classes for five days after he called a teacher by his Christian name outside of school hours.

Sean Roberts, 14, has been banned from Wellington Academy in the mornings and in the afternoons he must attend the school’s ‘department for naughty kids’.

The school in Tidworth, Wiltshire, is sponsored by Wellington College and its executive head is political historian Dr Anthony Seldon. Yesterday, Sean’s mother Julie Roberts, 42, demanded her son be allowed back in class ‘as the punishment is over the top’.

She claimed the Academy was ‘making an example' of her son.

Hairdresser Mrs Roberts - who has already lost 106 pounds in wages staying at home to look after him - said she was only told about the punishment in an evening phone call from the teacher Head of Department Barry Seymour

'This happened in the village where we live - it was outside of school. My son was walking home and my son shouted out to him Hi Barry. Barry followed him and challenged him at school the next day and my son said he did it.

'Then I had a phone call telling me my son was not allowed in school for five days but I have had nothing in writing and no official meeting. The night he called the punishment was due to start the next day.

'The teacher involved said to me your son shouted my name in a way that made me feel small and undermined. I said to him because I know this guy ‘come on Barry he is a 14 year old kid - you should not be intimidated by a 14 year old. Is that all he said and he said yes.

'I would have thought if they were sanctioning something so serious then I would have been called in for a meeting and laid out on the table what was going to happen - a structured plan. But I have had nothing - just a phone call from the teacher involved. I have had nothing in writing.

'I said to the guy on the phone that night when does this start and he said tomorrow. I said to him why are you phoning me? Why is the Principle not phoning me? You have a partial view you are the victim. You should not be phoning me.

'I said I have clients booked in and I am a single parent with a mortgage and three kids. I just cannot afford to cut clients. I have lost about 106 pounds.

Ben Bond - who is Vice Principal of the Academy, pictured - confirmed the boy was now subject to ¿five days alternative learning¿ following the incident

'I stayed at home the first morning to look after him but then I had to leave him in the house on his own but I did not want too. I had to go to work.'

Principle Michael Milner was yesterday unavailable for comment.

But Ben Bond - who is Vice Principal of the Academy - admitted the boy was now subject to ‘five days alternative learning’ which was a ‘relatively new sanction’ for what he had done.

And he admitted the comment may have been made ‘on the High Street’ outside of school hours.

But he stressed: 'He has been sanctioned for an accumulation of incidents. It was not a one off - it was a tipping point. Over a period of time there are a number of young people and Sean is one of them who have been involved in repeated and systematic undermining of staff by shouting things behind backs and under breath.

'The five days alternative learning is not simply because he said Barry to a member of staff in the street. Shouting someone’s name however jovial it might be in a group situation it is it not as abstract from the parents point of view

'We acted proportionately. But I do take that procedurally things need to be improved.There was an error - we should have made contract with mum.'

A recent OFSTED report says it required improvement.
