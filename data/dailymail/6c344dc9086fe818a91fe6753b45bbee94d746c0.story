A school superintendent has come under fire for reportedly telling her students they were dressed like 'skanks' before making them bend over so she could check the length of their skirts.

Ronda Bass insists she did nothing wrong and was simply trying to protect the girls of Noble High School in Oklahoma after noticing they were not following the dress code on the first day of school.

When she addressed the issue in assembly, she left many of the girls humiliated, students said. 

'As I was greeting the children coming in I knew we had a major, major problem on our hands,' she told KFOR.

'The first question I asked was, "How many of you in here believe that there are female students on the campus today that are dressed completely inappropriate?" Most of their hands went up.'

But students said that is not the language she used.

Student Katelynn Hill told KOCO the teacher actually said: 'Have any of you guys seen anybody around here dressed like a skank? If you can feel your skin on the bleachers then you’re showing your a**. And I don’t want to see anybody's a** hanging out of their shorts.'

Another student, Sophie Stephens, said that Bass singled her out even though she believed her shorts and long-sleeved shirt were appropriate for school.

She explained that Bass walked into her classroom and told the girls to stand while she checked their clothes.

'She told us to go out into the hallway and I actually watched her ask one of my classmates to bend over so she could see how short her shorts are,' Sophie told KOCO.

Humiliated: Students, including Katelynn Hill, said they did not believe the situation was handled well

Bass, who calls herself Momma Bear of the district, denied calling the girls 'skanks' but said she was strict about the clothing because she had heard her students were being ridiculed by other schools.

'I wouldn't have chosen this job unless I was willing to take on some of the stresses of it,' she said. 'I want us to be known as the classy lady Bears.'

She said she also sent an email to teachers saying the girls were 'pushing the limits' and wanted their help establishing modesty throughout the school. 

Despite her comments, students said that some of the girls were humiliated and do not believe Bass approached the issue in an appropriate way.

Some parents are petitioning for her resignation - while Bass said she has also received calls from parents applauding what she did.
