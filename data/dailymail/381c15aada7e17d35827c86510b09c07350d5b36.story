Emile Heskey is in contention to play for Bolton against Blackburn on Boxing Day after signing on a short-term contract.

The 36-year-old has been training with the club and made an appearance for their U21 side on Monday.

Heskey, who scored seven goals in 62 England games, was released by Australian A-League side Newcastle Jets in April.

'He will make us better, so for me it was a no-brainer,' Bolton manager Neil Lennon said. 'He's got real qualities - his physical presence, his touch, his awareness is still of a very high calibre. 

'These kind of players, they still have the quality. Their legs might go a little bit but he's still in very good condition for his age.

'It's a short-term deal so financially it won't hurt the club.'
