A couple who captured the heart of the nation after they were  injured in the Boston Marathon bombings has separated after just 10 months of marriage, a report claims.

Rebekah Gregory, 27, lost half her left leg after 30 operations, and Pete DiMartino, 30, suffered a shattered ankle, a ruptured eardrum, and lost his right Achilles tendon in the blast on April 15, 2013.

They had known each other for a year when they joined the crowd to watch DiMartino's mother finish the race.

Despite getting married and staying together as Gregory had her leg amputated, the couple have decided to part ways citing irreparable strain, The People reported.

Horrific: Gregory lost half her left leg after 30 operations, and DiMartino suffered a shattered ankle, a ruptured eardrum, and lost his right Achilles tendon in the blast

Gregory, who struggled her way down the aisle after learning to walk again following the amputation, told The People: 'After the decision was made to amputate my leg in November, I found myself having to make an even more painful choice – to separate from my husband Pete. 

'Over the last several months I've come to realize that going through such a horrific event together put a fast-forward on our relationship that we each handled differently.

'While my heart is beyond broken, I have a certain peace knowing from day one, I truly gave it my all, and have been fully invested in keeping this marriage, and my commitment before God. 

Decision: Gregory decided to amputate her left leg to release herself after 30 failed operations

Proposal: The couple had only known each other a year before the attack and married a year later

Fairytale: Gregory hobbled down the aisle in North Carolina and the couple relocated to Texas

Family: DiMartino became a stepfather to Gregory's seven-year-old son Noah

Difficult: Gregory said she and DiMartino reacted differently to a series of horrific events in their lives

'I still love Pete with all of my heart and ask that everyone respect our privacy as we try to figure out our next steps. 

'As for now, I am focused on doing what I feel is best for my son and I, and will concentrate my time on healing, both physically and emotionally.'

The couple had a fairytale wedding, documented on the season finale of TLC's popular reality show, Say Yes To The Dress.

They wed in Asheville, North Carolina, in April last year then moved to Houston, Texas.

When Gregory lost half her leg in November 2014, she said: 'I am thrilled because I am moving on with my life. I am taking away the old and bringing in the new and I just can't wait to see what it brings.'
