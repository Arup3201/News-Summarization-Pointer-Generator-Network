A new exhibition explores how fashion and ballet have been sources of inspiration for one another over the past two centuries.

Dance & Fashion, which has just opened at the Museum at FIT in New York City, features iconic stage costumes as well as photos and videos of various performances.

In recent times, it has not been uncommon for top fashion designers to create costumes for the ballet; among those represented in the exhibition are Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Lacroix, Jean Paul Gaultier and Prabal Gurung.

Tip toes: A pair of Comme des Garcons shoes from the spring 2005 collection demonstrate how dance influences fashion and vice versa

The show is created by the museum's director and lead historian, who told Elle: 'Dance and fashion are the two embodied arts forms all about the body. You couldn't have [either] without the body.'

One of the costumes on show is a flouncy red dress accented with a black leather strap. 

The look was created by Prabal Gurung for Capricious Maneuvers, a show that debuted in New York City in fall 2013.

A rather striking costume in the exhibition is a man's 'tattoo costume' designed by Stella McCartney, a nude body suit adorned with black designs giving the illusion of tattooed skin.

Seeing red: A pair of Tartan outfits were created by designer Isaac Mizrahi for Brief Fling, a 1990 performance with a distinctly Scottish theme

Flouncy: This Valentino gown was created for 2012 performance Bal de Couture

The costume - which came complete with a spiked headpiece - was worn by a male dancer in Ocean's Kingdom, a 2011 ballet that was set to music by Stella's father Paul McCartney.

A set of Tartan style outfits - a pair of trousers for a male dancer and a kilt-inspired dress for a female dancer - were created by designer Isaac Mizrahi for Brief Fling, a 1990 performance with a distinctly Scottish theme.

The costumes were donated to the museum by the American Ballet Theatre.

Costumed couture: The lead female dancer in Sophisticated Lady - a 2012 ballet set to Duke Ellington's songs - wore this Valentino gown

Yes pleats: Both the male and female dancers wore a yellow and black Versace skirt created for Herman Scherman, which debuted in 1992 

It's not just ballet costumes on display; the show will also feature a selection of flamenco dress and ensembles inspired by flamenco - including those designed by Cristobal Balenciaga, Oscar de la Renta and Ralph Lauren.

The show will include nearly 100 dance costumes and designs inspired by dance and ballet over the past two centuries, including many that have never been exhibited.
