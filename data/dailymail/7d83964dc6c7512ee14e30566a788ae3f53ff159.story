Everyone approaching retirement will be told when they are expected to die, ministers have said.

Life expectancy is measured by linking factors such as smoking, eating habits and socio-economic background.

The Government-backed guidance came as figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed a growing life expectancy gap between North and South.

Everyone approaching retirement will be told when they are expected to die, ministers have said. The Government-backed guidance came as figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed a growing life expectancy gap between North and South

Life expectancy at age 65 was highest for men in Harrow, where they could expect to live for a further 20.9 years compared with only 14.9 years for men in Glasgow City.

For women at age 65, life expectancy was highest in Camden (23.8 years) and lowest in Glasgow City (18.3 years).

Average male life expectancy in the UK is now 78.9 years.

The coast of Dorset is the longevity capital of Britain, with girls born in the Purbeck area expected to live to 86.6 years.

The neighbouring district of East Dorset has the highest male life expectancy at 82.9 years.

Mr Webb said insurance companies already had some of the mechanisms to calculate the figure using information such as postcodes, lifestyle choices like smoking and hereditary factors

The guidance is designed to help pensioners plan how much to spend and save.

Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, 
said retirees need to gain a sense of how long they might live to help 
make such financial decisions.

He
 said many people underestimate how long they will live. ‘If you are 
thinking about this, what do you do? For best guidance you probably 
think about how long your grandparents lived. But that is two 
generations out of date.’

The
 minister is asking pension providers to give people an estimate as part
 of guidance which will be rolled out in April next year.

The
 advice is linked to major pension reforms, announced in the Budget, 
which will allow people to draw down their money at any time, instead of
 seeing it tied up in annuities.

That
 led to warnings that people might be reckless, blowing their pension 
pots on expensive items instead of saving sensibly to last them 
throughout retirement.

At 
the time Mr Webb hit back, saying he was ‘relaxed’ if people wanted to 
buy Italian Lamborghini sports cars because that was their ‘choice’.

Mr Webb said for most people, their life expectancy will be 'much longer than they think'

But the Government also admitted that ‘consumers need to be able to make informed decisions’.

It
 is therefore guaranteeing ‘free, impartial face-to-face guidance’ for 
individuals reaching retirement through a new ‘duty’ on pension 
providers to deliver the advice.

Mr Webb said the type of questions that would be covered included asking people about their household, such as whether they have a spouse, what might happen if they died and if they had thought about residential care.

But life expectancy also had to be part of that consultation.

Mr Webb said insurance companies already had some of the mechanisms to calculate the figure using information such as postcodes, lifestyle choices like smoking and hereditary factors.

‘It is an average,’ added Mr Webb. ‘But for most people it will probably be longer than they think.’

Figures from the ONS show the North-South divide in life expectancy is widening because of the migration of young people with healthy lifestyles to the south-east.

Ambitious young and fit people are increasingly being drawn away from northern areas in search of higher paid jobs around London, according to the ONS.

Overall life expectancy is rising steadily across Britain – with women now projected to live to 82.7 years – a year longer than they were only four years ago.

Although men are still behind women, they are narrowing the gap rapidly, gaining almost 17 months in the last four years alone.

Noting how death rates are higher in northern England than the south, the ONS report said: ‘A number of factors have been identified as plausibly being responsible for the excess mortality in the northern regions of England.

‘These include socioeconomic, environmental, educational, lifestyle factors, which may act over the whole life course, and possibly over generations.’

It added: ‘One factor that has received less attention is the selective migration of healthy individuals from poorer health areas into better health areas or vice versa.’

Neil Duncan-Jordan of the National Pensioners Convention told The Mirror: 'I think people will either laugh at this idea or be very upset by it. It’s crude, blunt and a bit gimmicky.

'If you were told you were going to live to 98, you’d probably think, ‘That’s all right’, but if you only made it to 78, you’d be upset.”
