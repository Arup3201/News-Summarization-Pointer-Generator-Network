Stephen Farrington, 54, denied abusing the 15-year-old girl and said he had passed out after taking cocaine and Viagra

A paedophile jailed for fathering a baby with a 15-year-old girl has had his appeal rejected after claiming she raped him.

Stephen Farrington, 54, said he had passed out after taking cocaine and Viagra and denied abusing the underage teenager at a party.

He said the girl had taken advantage of him after he collapsed, and insisted he had been an 'unconscious participant'.

Farrington was jailed for four and a half years last July when a jury at Cambridge Crown Court refused to believe his story.

He appealed against his conviction but last week the Appeal Court kicked out his case and said his claims that he did not get a fair trial had 'no merit'.

The girl went on to have a baby girl which has been taken into care.

Lord Justice Pitchford said: ‘He accepted he was the father but claimed he had done nothing wrong because the girl had raped him.’

Farrington had earlier told police he had no memory of the event and only found out the next morning, when the girl explained what had happened.

The story was rejected by the jury, and he was jailed for four and a half years.

His laywers had argued that the jury was given an 'unfair' summing up at the end of the trial.

Applying to appeal, his lawyers argued that Judge Gareth Hawkesworth gave the jury an 'unbalanced and unfair' summing up at the end of the trial.

But Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting with Mr Justice Sweeney and Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, said he was 'doing nothing more than was required' and they dismissed the appeal.
