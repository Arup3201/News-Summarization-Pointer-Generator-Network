Nadine Dorries returned to Heathrow yesterday sporting her jungle hat from I'm A Celebrity

Nadine Dorries will not be reinstated as a Tory MP unless she apologises for taking part in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here, it emerged today.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP was summoned to a meeting with Conservative Chief Whip Sir George Young where she was expected to explain her decision to abandon Parliament for the Australian jungle.

She has been told to ‘rebuild bridges’ with angry colleagues, but party insiders say there is little prospect of her returning to the Conservative benches any time soon.

After the 15-minute chat, Ms Dorries said she was confident of having the Tory whip restored, and claimed being an MP was not a job but a 'life choice.

She also criticised a Labour MP who had only attended two thirds of Commons votes, despite him undergoing heart surgery.

David Cameron is understood to be backing Sir George in insisting that if she fails to show any remorse for taking part in the reality TV she will not have the party whip restored.

The Prime Minister has made clear his unhappiness with her decision to swap Parliament for the jungle, and Ms Dorries has used TV interviews since being kicked out of the reality show to claim she has been a victim of Downing Street briefings against her.

She has also claimed she would ‘do it again tomorrow’ and used Twitter to attack ‘the snobs’ who have criticised her.

A spokesman for Sir George said today: 'The whip has not been restored and nor will it be until she proves that she can rebuild bridges with her constituents, her association and her parliamentary colleagues.'

But it is not thought likely that Ms Dorries will be able to persuade Sir George to reistate her.

‘There is nothing to suggest she is going to get the whip back,’ said a senior Conservative source. ‘She has been told to rebuild bridges, but she has not got brilliant history on that.

'You would think that with everything that has gone on, she would be contrite but on the contrary she is saying she would do it again. I don’t think anyone in their right mind would look at Nadine’s response since she came back and not be quite flabbergasted.'

Ms Dorries had claimed she wanted to reach out to voters through the TV series, but she became the first celebrity to be dumped out of the jungle

The Mid Bedfordshire MP used Twitter to express her alarm at the media scrum as she arrived back in Britain, and defended taking time off from Westminster

Ms Dorries was suspended from the Tory party after flying to Australia earlier this month. She claims to have had permission to take time off from Westminster from then-Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell but admits she did not tell him it was to take part in the show.

She claims that other MPs have also taken long spells away from Westminster. She attacked Labour MP Stephen McCabe on 
Twitter for reporting her to the standards commissioner, telling him his
own attendance rate was just 63 per cent.

But he responded, pointing out that he had taken time off to recover from having open heart surgery.

Mr McCabe wrote on Twitter: 'Imagine equating time off for open heart surgery with a paid for holiday on a reality TV show. Says all we need to know.'

But Ms Dorries was unrepentant, replying: 'I think with your 63% attendance record, you should be quiet. Obvioulsy been taking a few holidays of your own!'

Speaking after the meeting with Sir George, Ms Dorries said she was confident that the party whip would be restored.

Sir George Young arrived at Number 10 Downing Street for this morning's Cabinet meeting before his meeting with Ms Dorries

'I think we will be fine with the 
whip,' she told BBC Three Counties Radio. 'We had a very good-natured, a
very happy meeting. We have adjourned the meeting and we are 
reconvening this time next week, if not before.'

Ms Dorries insisted that she wanted to
carry on in Parliament. 'Of course I want to be an MP.

'An MP is not 
doing a job, it is a life choice. If I didn't want to make that life 
choice I wouldn't be doing it, I can assure you.'

This week Ms Dorries claimed to have missed only three parliamentary days, despite the Commons sitting 11 times while she was away.

She insisted she would 'do it again tomorrow' as she was confronted by paparazzi photographers at Heathrow yesterday after viewers made her the first contestant to be booted of the show.

It is thought a major factor in deciding her fate will be the response from people in Mid Bedfordshire.

A poll in her constituency carried out while she was still in the jungle revealed almost 60 per cent of Conservatives ‘disapprove’ of her decision to abandon Parliament.

Asked to rate how they feel about Miss Dorries, ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘extremely negative’, she scored just 2.82, while 58 per cent said David Cameron was right to suspend her.Just 8 per cent said they were now more likely to vote for her.

Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, who commissioned the survey, said: ‘Nadine said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge audience about important questions, at a time when nobody pays attention to politicians. Unfortunately, her constituents are not buying this.’

However, Ms Dorries says she has received hundreds of supportive emails and messages on Twitter, claiming the media reaction to her absence has been 'slightly hysterical'.

Ms Dorries said: 'I think my constituents have been fed a huge line. This how I have chosen to spend my holiday and this is what I've chosen to do. When MPs go on holiday they switch their phones off.

'I think there has been a slightly hysterical reaction. 'I think that some of the attention that I am receiving is to do with people thinking I'm going to go to another party, but I'm not. Just because I'm critical of Cameron it doesn't mean I'm about to defect,' she told the Bedford Times & Citizen.

'What the time in the jungle has meant is that no-one doesn't know who Nadine Dorries is in terms of being an MP,' she added.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political issues in front of a TV audience of millions

Tory strategists were appalled at pictures of Mr Dorries sunbathing at a time when constituents are struggling to make ends meet back home in Britain

'When I speak out about subjects in 
the future, people will know who it is that is talking about it, and I 
will have more of an audience. My colleagues in Parliament say that I am
now the best-known MP in Britain.'

Ms Dorries confirmed she will donate 
her MP's salary for a month to local play schemes for children in her 
constituency, and insisted that reports of her fee from I'm A Celebrity -
widely estimated at £40,000 - are 'massively exaggerated'.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she 
wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political 
issues, including lowering the abortion limit, in front of a TV audience
of millions.

But none of the political conversations were aired.

Instead she was seen eating an ostrich anus and camel toe in a Bushtucker Trial and performing a series of bad jokes with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather.

Budge Wells, deputy chairman of the Mid-Beds Conservative Association, said a meeting about 'how to move on' from the row will be held next week.

He said: 'We will, of course, invite Nadine Dorries to the meeting and we will listen to what she has to say. Hopefully we can come to a conclusion as to how to move on.

'She needs to establish a rapport with the constituency. I don’t want to pre-empt anything until we have listened to her.'

He said the local party office had received several emails about Ms Dorries’ TV appearance.

'Most of the emails are not praising her for what she has done,' he added. 'It’s been a very difficult time for everybody.'

Mr Cameron is understood to be determined to send a clear message to other Tory MPs his unhappiness at her decision to swap Parliament for the Australian jungle.

Before flying home, she took a swipe at critics in her own party, claiming female MPs who condemned her for abandoning her constituents were fuelled by ‘jealousy’.

Last Thursday, when the Commons was debating women bishops, giving prisoners the vote and welfare reform, Ms Dorries was pictured going down a slide with Linda Robson, Charlie Brooks and Ashley Roberts

Instead of taking part in Commons debates, the Mid Bedfordshire MP was seen chatting with former darts champion Eric Bristow

In an interview before flying home, Ms Dorries was unrepentant when asked if she thought she would be frozen out on her return to Westminster.

‘Do I care? Why would I know? Why would I be interested in that? The word jealousy springs to mind actually,’ she told Iain Dale on LBC 97.3.

‘I know what’s happened. A lot of MPs including the female MPs, and the female MPs I’ve been told are the critical ones are the jobless and the more ambitious.’
