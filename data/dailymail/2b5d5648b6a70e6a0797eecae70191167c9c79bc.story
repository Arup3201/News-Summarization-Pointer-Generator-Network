Famous family: Michael Thatcher, 24, the grandson of Baroness Thatcher, lives in America

His birth was famously announced
when the Prime Minster proudly stood on the 
steps of 10 Downing Street holding him in her arms and declared 'We 
have become a grandmother.'

And with politics running in the family blood, Michael Thatcher, 24, once hailed a rising American 
football star, now looks set to follow his grandmother's career path.

The news of Baroness Thatcher's death this week is said to have been devastating for Michael and his sister Amanda, 19.

Although they now live in America following the divorce of their father Sir Mark Thatcher and his first wife Diane Beckett, a source told the Telegraph they had seen their grandmother recently.

They are now preparing to fly over to London for her funeral on Wednesday with their mother.

Michael was last publicly photographed with his grandmother as he looked at her with concern etched on his young face as she wept outside the memorial service of her late husband, Sir Denis Thatcher.

Sir Mark, Micheal's father and Lady Thatcher's son, married Diane Beckett, the Texan-born daughter of a wealthy U.S. car dealer in 1987.

Two years later Lady Thatcher's first and only grandson arrived, following by his sister - the pair are her only grandchildren.

The family moved to South Africa, but that is where their life fell apart and the couple split up.

In 2005, Sir Mark received a 
four-year suspended jail term and a £265,000 fine in South Africa, for 
his involvement in a plot to overthrow the president of the oil-rich 
African state of Equatorial Guinea.

The conviction means that Sir Mark can not enter the U.S. to visit his children, whose mother was given custody in the divorce.

Diane Beckett moved the children back to her native America after the marriage of 20 years ended.

She went on to marry James 
Beckett, a multi-millionaire sports publisher a year after divorcing the
former Prime Minster's son. 

After graduating from high school Michael went on to study at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas.

Inheriting his grandmother’s passion for conservative politics, Michael recently worked for a 
Republican-aligned political organisation that aims to 'educate and 
empower the Hispanic community with conservative values'.

New arrival: Lady Thatcher proudly holding her first grandchild

Adryana Boyne, director of the organisation, called VOCES (Voices Offering Conservative Empowering Solutions) wrote a blog tribute to the Iron Lady, reported The Times.

In the post she said 'Michael Thatcher has always been so 
discreet, and prudent about his relationship with Lady Thatcher.'

She said that both Michael and his sister made sure they did not use her name 'with arrogance and pride.'

'Not only those grandchildren have not 
used her name to try to exalt themselves, but all the opposite they have
always been humble and kind.

'The Thatcher grandchildren have 
demonstrated their own successes as young people on their own for whom 
they are, not because their last name and personal relationship with one
of the most the most extraordinary woman in this century.

Ms Boyne
added: 'Amanda Margaret Thatcher, a college girl, is an extraordinary 
woman of faith with a melodious voice and a kind heart (and as my son 
Samuel says, she bakes good chocolate lava cakes).

Amanda is said to be 
an excellent runner, and most closely resembles her father, enjoys 
baking and horse-riding and singing.

Ms Boyne
noted the pair had 'been successful in their studies, sports and personal goals.'

She may have been particularly referring to Micheal's success as an American football player.

Michael started playing the sport when he moved to Dallas in 2004 and in 2007 he helped his high 
school American football team into the Texas state finals.

Aged 18, he took a brilliant diving catch from a looping 48-yard pass in front of 10,000 fans last week.

The dramatic moment was broadcast 
live on TV and one excited commentator exclaimed: 'Wow! Can the guy run,
can he catch, can he do everything?'

He admitted to being in 'a state of shock' about his catch.

'I'm the kind of guy who gets pretty nervous coming out,' he said.

'But as soon as we start running the ball, I'll come into a rhythm and I'm sure the rest of the team is the same way.'

Randy Allen, coach of the Scots, the 
Highland Park high school team in Dallas, praised the teenager's 'hard 
work, dedication and discipline'.

Mr Allen said: 'He could be one of the best running backs in the state.'

Although Lady Thatcher, appeared to
have little interest in sport, her late husband, Denis, was a rugby 
referee and a keen golfer.

On news of Lady Thatcher's death Mrs Beckett told The Telegraph: 'She led an incredible life, and she will be dearly missed.

'My children and I are of course heartbroken, but we also have some wonderful memories.'

It is believed Mrs Beckett had remained friends with Baroness Thatcher after her and Sir Mark's marriage broke down.
