David Cameron accused Argentina of 
‘colonialism’ for threatening the Falkland Islands yesterday after being
 warned the regime in Buenos Aires is plotting a mock ‘fishermen’s 
invasion’.

He dramatically raised the diplomatic stakes during an exchange at Prime Minister’s Questions. 

The accusation by the Prime Minister came as it emerged that the Ministry of Defence has 'contingency plans' in place enabling troops to be deployed swiftly in an emergency to the Falklands via Ascension Island.

Last night Argentina’s interior 
minister Florencio Randazzo hit back after Mr Cameron approved the MoD plans, saying: ‘It is absolutely 
offensive especially in the case of Britain. History clearly shows what its attitude to the world was.’

The war of words is fresh evidence of
 the increasing tension between the two countries in the run-up to the 
30th anniversary of the invasion of the islands by Argentina in April 
1982 and their liberation by British forces.

Pledge: David Cameron said Britain should urge the international community to step up sanctions against Syria

Days ago, the Prime Minister hosted a
 National Security Council summit which was devoted to the defence of 
the islands, which are claimed by Argentina as Las Malvinas.

Ministers were shown plans drawn up 
to combat a campaign of intimidation planned by Argentina to mark the 
anniversary.

Mr Cameron was warned at the meeting of intelligence 
showing that Argentine fishermen could be sent to land on the Falklands 
and the neighbouring island of South Georgia to plant an Argentine flag 
this spring.

The mock invasion fears have echoes 
of the 1982 conflict which began when an Argentine force landed on South
 Georgia, which was defended by a small company of Royal Marines.

Chief of the Defence Staff General 
Sir David Richards has already outlined Britain’s contingency plans and 
reassured Mr Cameron that Britain can defend the islands.

But ministers 
and spy chiefs warned the Prime Minister that Argentine president 
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will use the anniversary as the pretext 
to ‘raise the temperature’.

At the NSC summit, Mr Cameron led a 
series of war game discussions about how to respond to a series of 
provocations by Argentina.

The NSC agreed that the Falklands 
police – rather than the Armed Forces – would be used to combat a 
flag-planting stunt by the Argentines.

But Mr Cameron went public with 
details of the meeting yesterday to deliver a ‘strong message’ to Buenos
 Aires that the UK will respond militarily if Argentina tries to reclaim
 the islands.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to send a 'strong message' about the islands which the Argentinians refer to as the Malvinas, following months of escalating rhetoric from Buenos Aires

The Prime Minister told the Commons that the islanders can
 remain British as long as they want.

‘What the Argentinians have been 
saying recently, I would argue, is far more like colonialism because 
these people want to remain British and the Argentinians want them to do
 something else,’ he said.

A Royal Navy ship caused outrage in South America earlier this month after docking in Uruguay as tensions build ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.

HMS Protector's presence in the port of Montevideo on January 5 came days after the Mercosur bloc, made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, agreed a pact to close ports to Falklands vessels.

It had made a 'routine stop' on its way to the islands.

A photo of the Portsmouth-based ice patrol ship appeared on the front page of Uruguayan national newspaper El Observador with the headline 'English boat in the port'.

The article was critical of Uruguayan port authorities for allowing Protector to stop over ahead of going on to the Falklands.

It was the Uruguayan government - in an act of solidarity with Argentina - which proposed the move to close ports to vessels carrying the 'illegal' Falklands flag at a summit in Montevideo on December 21.

But Uruguayan port authorities claim there was nothing to stop HMS Protector coming into Montevideo on December 30 because she sails under the Royal Navy's White Ensign.

Commentators say the new row exposes cracks in Uruguay's support for Argentina.

Mr Cameron said he ordered the NSC discussion so he could ‘make sure our defences and everything else is in order’.

He added: ‘It is important for 
Britain to send a clear message that as long as people in the Falklands 
want to remain British, we respect that right of self-determination.

‘The reason for holding a National Security Council is to make sure nobody is in any doubt that Britain supports that right of 
self-determination, and we will go on doing so for as long as people in 
the Falklands want to continue in that way. I think it is important that
 everyone understands that.’

The NSC also heard that Prince 
William will go ahead with a posting to the Falklands as a search and 
rescue pilot next month. Argentina has called the posting a 
‘provocation’.

General Richards detailed the military assets defending the islands and made clear that reinforcements could be sent quickly.

Forces based on the islands include 
four Eurofighter Typhoons and 150 troops, while the surrounding seas are
 patrolled by the frigate Montrose, the offshore patrol vessel Clyde and
 survey ship Protector.

A Government source said: ‘Kirchner 
is highly unpredictable. The meeting was designed to make sure we are 
totally plugged into where the threats might come from.

'We think there 
will be a further push at interfering efforts from Argentina.’

Mr Cameron also outlined plans for a 
series of events to honour the 255 British servicemen and three 
islanders who died in the 1982 war.
