Every year, the month of November brings out the best - and worst - of sportsmen's moustaches.

All for a good cause, raising money for men's health, stars from the world of football, rugby, cricket, and more, leave their facial hair alone for an entire month.

Here, Sportsmail's Movember picture special takes you through the 20 best of the bunch.

To donate, or for further information, visit the Movember website.  

Joe Hart - Manchester City and England footballer

Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is head and shoulders above his team-mates when it comes to his Movember effort. Needless to say, he's got a fair amount of growth - a good effort from England's number one

Gary Lineker - Match of the Day presenter and ex-footballer 

Movember stalwart Gary Lineker's moustache/goatee is making him look more and more like previous Match of the Day presenter Jimmy Hill every day... we're not sure whether wife Danielle is a fan, though

Ugo Monye - Rugby union player for Harlequins and England

Rugby Union's Ugo Monye has gone for a more sophisticated look with his Movember 'tache. Unlike some of his sporting counterparts, the Harlequins winger has styled his effort, even using a 'Monye Mo Wax'

Michael Nelson - Cambridge United defender, formerly of Norwich

Cambridge defender Michael Nelson has been scaring League Two defenders for the month of November with this stern effort. The U's have won three of their five matches this month, so it seems to have done the trick

Eric Lichaj - Footballer for Nottingham Forest and the USA

Eric Lichaj's effort doesn't appear to have had the same effect though... Nottingham Forest's form reads two wins and three losses. A 3-0 away win at Wolves (pictured) has to be a highlight though

Greg Rutherford - Long Jump Olympic Gold Medallist 

Greg Rutherford has really embraced the spirit of Movember, regularly posting pictures on social media of his growth. Not only is he a record-breaking, medal-winning long jumper, we reckon he'd get a gold for this too!

Christian Atsu - Chelsea winger, on loan at Everton 

Okay, so on-loan Everton winger Christian Atsu is technically cheating with this effort, but we thought it fair to include it as he's gone to some trouble to post this photo. Hopefully it raised some money for charity

Dan Hanford - Carlisle United goalkeeper, formerly of Floriana 

Earlier in the month, Carlisle goalkeeper Dan Hanford said of his growth: 'It’s going quite well at the moment. I’m a fair haired lad so it isn’t showing up as much as it could be.'

Danny Care - Rugby Union scrum-half for Harlequins and England

Danny Care's moustache has an Italian feel about it. The Harlequins scrum-half looks to have taken some tips from team-mate Ugo Monye, with a Movember effort styled very carefully

Jonny Bairstow - Cricketer for Yorkshire and England

The epitome of cool. Lounging by the pool with a coffee, Yorkshire and England cricketer Jonny Bairstow has produced a fantastic effort for this year's Movember. Potentially the best of the lot.

George North - Rugby Union winger for Northampton and Wales

Simple but effective. Pictured last Saturday during Wales' national anthem before their match against New Zealand, George North is standing proud with an impressive moustache to match.

Tom Wood - Rugby Union flanker for Northampton and England

Yet another rugby player on our list of top Movember 'taches. England flanker Tom Wood is pictured (right) with another moustachioed man - a Movember raffle prize winner. Wood has really got into the spirit

James Haskell - Rugby Union flanker for Wasps and England

Anything his England team-mates can do, James Haskell can do better. Pictured during England training this week, the fair-haired Wasps captain has grown an impressively long moustache 

Liam Williams - Rugby Union fullback for Scarlets and Wales 

Sticking with rugby - after all, they do seem to produce the best moustaches - we have Liam Williams of Wales. It's a slightly more subtle effort, and to be honest, it actually suits him

Richie McCaw - Rugby union flanker and captain for New Zealand

Richie McCaw is the final rugby player to make our list, and what a way to finish. He's the leader of New Zealand's impressive rugby side... and, well, leaders look better with facial hair, don't they?

Joey Barton - Queens Park Rangers midfielder

Joey Barton is next, and the QPR midfielder has gone for the unkempt look. He was all smiles before Rangers' game against Leicester on Saturday (pictured) and we're pretty sure he was smiling at full-time as well

Justin Fontaine - NHL Ice Hockey player for Minnesota Wild 

Justin Fontaine isn't particularly well-known on this side of the Atlantic, but the 27-year-old Canadian NHL player's moustache was too good to ignore when compiling this list

Keith Lowe - York City defender, formerly of Cheltenham  

York City defender Keith Lowe, formerly of Burnley, QPR and Swansea, looks as though he's just caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. A frightening, but brilliant, 'tache

Steve Claridge - Football League Show pundit and ex-footballer 

BBC pundit and ex-footballer Steve Claridge looks as if he's grown a small animal above his top lip. The less said about this one, the better

James Taylor - Cricketer for Nottinghamshire 

Last, but by no means least, is Nottinghamshire cricketer James Taylor. His county side tweeted this week that they weren't convinced the 'tache wasn't stuck on... don't worry James, we believe you!
