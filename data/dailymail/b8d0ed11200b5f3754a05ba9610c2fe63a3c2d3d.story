One of the suspected killers of British soldier Lee Rigby wrote and starred in a school play about gang violence in which his character was arrested by police for carrying a gun, a former classmate has claimed.

Michael Adebowale played a young man who gets in with a bad crowd in the play for his GCSE drama exam while a student at Kidbrooke School in Greenwich.

A classmate, who was in the same year as Adebowale, 22, and was one of around four other students who co-wrote the play, described him as 'weird' and 'easily influenced.

The classmate, who did not want to be named, told the Daily Telegraph: 'I always got the feeling there was something wrong with him.

'He used to do weird things but I used to think that was part of his personality. I used to laugh it off. I never knew I was laughing off something this big.'

Adebowale, who is currently in hospital, was shot by armed police after allegedly hacking to death 25-year-old Lee Rigby on Wednesday last week.

He was one of around five pupils who co-wrote and performed the gang violence play for a GCSE drama exam.

The classmate said that in the play, 
Adebowale's character was thrown a gun by another boy and the police 
turned up and arrested him.

He
explained: 'It had to be something that showed a clear message, so 
obviously our message there was "don't get mixed up with the wrong 
crow".

'It seems Ironic now looking back at it.'

Adebowale was born in 1991. His Nigerian-born mother Juliet Obasuyi was a 
probation officer and a ‘hard-working’ Christian woman who had raised 
him as a single parent after separating from his father.

Known to his schoolmates as Tobi from his middle name Oluwatobi, started at Kidbrooke in 2002. The classmate described him as a joker who was one to follow the crowd.

He was apparently a keen, but not particularly skilled, footballer whose friends used to joke about him having two left feet.

He left school at 16 after which he converted to Islam.

Another
schoolmate Luqman Ciise said on Twitter: ‘I knew him personally, he was
normal, smiling all the time. His name was Toby. Still can’t believe 
this . . . How did he get radicalised?’

Adebowale
was said to have converted to Islam at 19, while studying at Greenwich 
University, where he met the other Woolwich suspect, Michael Adebolajo.

Family
friend Madeleine Edwards, 49, said Adebowale had been in ‘some serious 
gangland trouble’ in 2010 and that his mother had told her he ‘had to 
disappear for a while’.

She said Adebowale’s father was a ‘typical African gentleman’ but his mother had struggled to control her wayward son.

A friend who has known Adebowale since he was 11 spoke of his shock at seeing the video of the Woolwich atrocity.

The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That wasn’t the same person.

‘He wasn’t someone monstrous, that was not the same person.

‘He converted to Islam, preaching Islam, preaching peace. Not preaching anything bad or anything negative. Just literally the ways of Islam.

‘I would see him going to mosque and coming back from mosque.

‘He was completely normal . . . He was one of us at school. Nothing evil about him at all.’
