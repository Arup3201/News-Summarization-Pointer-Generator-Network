Tory grandee: Lord Tebbit (pictured in April) said  ragwort was a big problem in his part of East Anglia

Young unemployed people should be made to pull up ragwort from roadside verges in return for benefits, a Tory grandee has said.

Former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Tebbit, 83, made the proposal to combat the rampant weed in a letter to an insect charity.

He wrote to Matt Shardlow, chief executive of a charity called Buglife, which is concerned about the effect of declining ragwort on bees and rare insects.

Tebbit said ragwort was a major problem in his part of East Anglia and proposed it could be weeded out by ‘Neets’ - young people who are not in education, work or training - and ‘low level criminals’.

Ragwort, also known as Jacobaea vulgaris, is a common wildflower which is poisonous to cattle and horses.

He wrote: ‘I suggest you come to the Norfolk/Suffolk border areas of East Anglia. Landowners who wish to control ragwort face an impossible task when roadside verges are dominated by it to an extent I cannot remember in the past.

‘There would be little cost to bring that under control if Neets and low level criminals were required as part of their contribution to the society which finances them, or which they have abused… to uproot this weed.’

Tebbit later told the Guardian: ‘Given a bit of organisation, they would be happy doing something constructive. That’s something constructive for them.

‘It’s appealing, it gets rid of a weed which is a danger to some animals and helps landowners in the cultivation of their land.

Criticism: Chris Bryant (above), the shadow welfare reform minister, said the comments reflected the 'values of the Victorian workhouse' in which out-of-work people were forced to perform demeaning, unpaid labour

‘That was my thought that caused me to suggest the idea… in a way it’s a form of national service, of doing something for society in a way in which anyone unless they are physically disabled can participate.’

Asked whether he acknowledged some might find the idea of forced labour in return for benefits controversial, he said: ‘It’s workfare but I think there are some powerful arguments for workfare and so does [Labour MP] Frank Field for example. It’s not a way-out idea in that sense.

‘If you go back to the Beveridge report on which the whole welfare state has been based, you’ll find he took the view that youngsters who had never worked should not receive benefits because they have not contributed anything.’

Previous comments: Lord Tebbit, who was a minister under Margaret Thatcher (together in 1982), was famous for telling the jobless to get on their bikes and look for work - as his father had in the 1930s

He added: ‘I am much more modest about this than Beveridge was and I suspect Ernie Bevan might have been on my side in it. I just think a lot of those youngsters want something to do which is constructive.’

However, Labour MP Chris Bryant, the shadow welfare reform minister, said the comments reflected the ‘values of the Victorian workhouse’ in which out-of-work people were forced to perform demeaning, unpaid labour.

He told the Guardian: ‘There’s one weed that I would like to uproot: it’s sitting in the House of Lords. 

'Lord Tebbit’s proposal, which effectively equates being out of work with being a criminal, is both offensive and ludicrous.’
