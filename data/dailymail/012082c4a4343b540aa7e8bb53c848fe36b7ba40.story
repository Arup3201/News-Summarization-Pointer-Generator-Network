Manuel Pellegrini wants Frank Lampard to put his American ambitions on hold and see out the rest of the season with Manchester City.

Midfielder Lampard, 36, is due to leave City at the end of the month to join New York City - the champions’ new sister club in the USA.

The MLS season starts in mid-March but Pellegrini wants Lampard to stay in Manchester and help his side’s title charge.

Pellegrini believes Lampard has become a 'very important' player for the Premier League champions

Asked if he would like Lampard to remain at the Etihad Stadium, the City manager replied: ‘Of course - he’s a very important player for us and we need him in this moment.

‘He couldn’t start in the US until January or February, so he prefers to stay here until December. If he can finish the year here, better.

‘Frank is a very important player for us and I hope we will not have any problems for him to stay here. But I cannot say just from one side what will happen with him.

‘He has a loan just until the end of December and there is another club involved, the MLS is involved also, there’s a lot of parties with an arrangement. It’s not just depending on one opinion.’

A run of six straight wins has helped City close the gap on league leaders Chelsea and they head to Leicester on Saturday just three points behind Jose Mourinho’s team.

Pellegrini’s men are faced with keeping the pressure on the pace-setters without their leading scorer Sergio Aguero. The Argentina striker has scored 19 goals in 21 games this season but faces at least a month out with a knee injury.

And Pellegrini says he would not rule out a move for a new forward in January.

‘I never close any window about anything we can do to give us an advantage,’ the Chilean said.

‘If all the teams can do it, we can do it also. If we are thinking about that — at this moment we’re not — we will analyse in the moment what we are going to do.

‘Now we are in that moment we are going to make the best decision for the club.’

Pellegrini said Aguero, 26, would not be allowed to return to his native Argentina for Christmas and would continue his rehabilitation with the club in Manchester.

In Aguero’s absence, Edin Dzeko will lead City’s attack and Pellegrini says he has every confidence in the Bosnia striker.

‘We trust a lot in Edin,’ Pellegrini said. ‘He had a very good season last season with us. He just renewed his contract, he did that because we trust in him, now it is his moment to try to score goals and try to return to the performance level he had before he was injured.’

Pellgrini also confirmed that Joe Hart and James Milner are both close to signing new long-term contracts. Goalkeeper Hart, 27, is poised to agree a five-year contract, while midfielder Milner, 28, will get a four-year deal.

‘It’s very close,’ Pellegrini said. ‘Joe wants to stay here. We also want him to be our goalkeeper so I hope it will be ready as soon as possible. I don’t think that we are going to have any problems.

‘Milner, I hope that he will sign also. We will see, same as Joe in the next days. I don’t know how many days we can have this as official news.

‘He will sign and continue here because he also wants to stay.’
