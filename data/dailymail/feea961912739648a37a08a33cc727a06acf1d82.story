Food Standards Australia New Zealand is considering allowing electrolyte drinks 'to carry health claims related to their respective purposes'

A bottle of sports drink has nine teaspoons of sugar and should be on the shelves next to soft drinks such as Coke and Lemonade rather than being allowed to carry claims of health benefits on their bottles, a consumer advocacy group has warned.

Consumer group Choice claims most people receive no health benefits from drinking sports drinks, which contained a similar amount of sugar to a can of coke. 

Choice has also revealed that a 600mL bottle of Gatorade has 36 grams of sugar - or nine teaspoons - while a standard 375ml can of Coca Cola has 40 grams, or one extra teaspoon. 

The group said the drinks should be in soft drink isles of supermarkets rather then next to health foods.

The comments follows a submission by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand asking for electrolyte drinks 'to carry health claims related to their respective purposes'.

Drinks are currently required to have a certain level of energy, sugar and sodium before they can say that they 'improve hydration'.

'Rules about health claims were introduced last year to stop situations where you had clearly unhealthy products like sweets and chocolates making claims that they were 99 per cent fat free,' a spokesperson for CHOICE, Tom Godfrey, said.

'There's extensive research showing that any specific health claim gives a product a "halo effect" and people believe the product is healthier overall.' 

Consumer group CHOICE, has opposed the proposal claiming it would mislead consumers

'Sports drinks can help elite athlete but they aren't designed for everyday use,' Mr Godfrey said

'Yet drinks like Gatorade and Powerade are marketed and sold to everyone.

'Most people will receive no health benefit from a bright blue sugar drink. Sports drinks belong on the shelves next to Coke and Lemonade, not in the health food aisle and the claims on the label need to reflect this.'

The advocacy group claims that the drinks are already well overused by consumers who drink the product when playing sport, when they are simply spending time outdoors or as hangover cures.

'There's extensive research showing that any specific health claim gives a product a "halo effect" and people believe the product is healthier overall,' CHOICE spokesperson, Tom Godfrey, said

However, Geoff Parker from the Australian Beverages Council said the labelling would allow product supplier to share research about the benefits of hydrating through sports drinks with consumers, rather than misleading them.

'What manufacturers wanted to do was to tap into a whole lot of internationally recognised research and scientific studies which are out there, which start to flesh out some of the more detailed, functional benefits that electrolytes and sports drinks can actually make,' he told the ABC.

'So some of their claims might be ... that sports drinks hydrate better than water for intensive exercise, for example, or [that] sports drinks hydrate twice as fast as water for intensive exercise.'
