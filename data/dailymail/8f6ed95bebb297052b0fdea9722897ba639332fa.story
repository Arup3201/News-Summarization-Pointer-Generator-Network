When someone emerges unscathed after their 8,000bhp race car becomes a fireball at 260mph, you might expect them to be relieved.

But for drag racer Matt Hagan - who has now survived three such explosions in as many years - his dramatic exit from a qualifying race was simply cause for a sulk.

Spectators at the Four-Wide Nationals, in Charlotte, North Carolina, were stunned when the uninjured driver climbed from the smoking wreckage, tossed a scrap of bodywork to the tarmac and stomped off to the pits.

Fireball: The carbon fibre bodywork swells as flames erupt from the engine

Just seconds before, the carbon fibre shell of his 'funny car' - a class of drag racing vehicle - had rippled like cloth as flames erupted from the engine and tore backwards through the driver's cabin.

Everything but the bonnet was ripped off and strewn across the track as a parachute deployed to bring the charred framework to a halt.

According to Top Gear, the explosion took place after an intake valve dropped into one of the engine cylinders, leaving three of the four race lanes scattered with debris.

While Hagan faced his third consecutive frustration in the qualifying rounds, rival Robert Hight claimed his fourth Funny Car victory in a row on Sunday.

His victory at ZMAX Dragway, in Concord, North Carolina, marked four wins in five races as he lifted the trophy at the National Hot Rod Association event, Rushlane reports.

Other winners in the Full Throttle Drag Racing series included Spencer Massey in the Top Fuel class and Greg Anderson in Pro Stock.

Unbelievable: Matt Hagan walks away from what's left of his 8,000bhp car, seeming more concerned about dropping out of the tournament than his incredible escape
