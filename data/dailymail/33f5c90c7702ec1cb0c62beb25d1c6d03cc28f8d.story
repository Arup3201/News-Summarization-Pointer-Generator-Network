A baker who lost a discrimination case for turning away a gay couple has revealed he will stop making wedding cakes completely.

Jack Phillips, 57, refused to bake a wedding cake for Denver residents David Mullins, 29, and Charlie Craig, 34 - despite it being claimed he was happy to make one for two dogs.

The couple sued him and won in a landmark case, which saw the Colorado Civil Rights Commission unanimously declare free speech and business should be separate.

Rising anger: Baker Jack Phillips, from Denver, Colorado, said he will stop baking wedding cakes completely after a landmark ruling declared he was wrong to refuse an order from a gay couple on the grounds of belief

Court battle: Charlie Craig, 34 (left) and his husband David Mullins, 29 (right) have fought the decision for almost two years after the American Civil Liberties Union took up their case. Mr Mullins said he was 'thrilled'

Now Mr Phillips has revealed he will stop baking wedding cakes altogether so he will not be 'forced to participate' in a same-sex ceremony.

He told CBS 4 Denver: 'We would close down the bakery before we would complicate our beliefs.

'If it's just a birthday, I have no problem with that. My issue is that I don't want to be forced to participate in a same-sex wedding'.

But the Masterpiece Cakeshop, which also employs his sister and 87-year-old mother, is unlikely to go out of business.

He claimed had been so 
overwhelmed by supporters eager to buy cookies and brownies that he does
 not need to make wedding cakes any more.

It has been illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation since 2008 in Colorado, which legalised same-sex 'beneficiary agreements' the following year. Last year the state legalised same-sex civil unions.

However, gay marriage remains illegal in Colorado and the couple's ceremony in September 2012 was held in Massachusetts, followed by the reception at their Denver home.

Loving: The couple at their home in Denver, Colorado, where they had the reception. Gay marriage is still illegal in Colorado so they had to hold the ceremony itself in Massachusetts, where it was legalised in 2004

Home life: The couple playing cards. In the ruling, Colorado Civil Rights Commissioner Raju Jaram said: 'I can believe anything I want, but if I'm going to do business here, I'd ought to not discriminate against people'

Ordinary: The couple said they never intended to become the focus of a global campaign, but were just angry

The panel this week ordered Phillips to stop discriminating against gay people and to report
 quarterly for two years on staff anti-discrimination training and any 
customers he refuses to serve.

Commissioner Raju Jaram said: 'I can believe 
anything I want, but if I'm going to do business here, I'd ought to not 
discriminate against people.'

Mr Mullins said he was 'thrilled'.

'The next time a gay couple wanders in there asking for a wedding cake, they won’t have the experience we had,' he said. 'They will have a responsible experience and leave feeling respected.'

The Christian baker has said he may appeal the ruling.

This commission's decision confirmed a lower court's finding in December that Phillips had violated 
civil rights law.

It was the end of a two-year battle which began after a furious Mr Mullins wrote a report of his encounter on Facebook.

Support: The baker said he had been inundated with people wanting to buy cupcakes and brownies from him

Christian Mr Phillips had refused service to gay couples before because he claimed it was against the Bible

The baker said: 'In everything I do, I think about how people will perceive Christ through me, by what I sell'

'Today, Charlie and I went to cake shop to get a wedding cake and were turned away and informed they did not serve gay weddings,' he wrote.

'I AM FURIOUS! But, I'm also not going to take this lying down.'

He posted the address and phone number of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Denver, Colorado, on Facebook and the reaction soon spiralled into a full-blown campaign.

Ceremony: The couple wed in 2012. The 'equals' symbol stands for equal marriage

Mr Mullins and Mr Craig campaigned outside the shop with placards declaring 'Let them eat cake' and it was inundated with phone calls.

The couple said they never intended to become the focus of a global campaign, but were just angry.

The baker had insisted after the encounter, which lasted less than a minute, that he was just sticking to his Christian beliefs.

But the American Civil Liberties Union - which took the case to court - then claimed a lesbian couple found out Mr Phillips was happy to bake a wedding cake for two dogs.

An ACLU spokesman said: 'They wanted to order some cupcakes to celebrate their commitment ceremony... but the store refused to take their order, informing the couple that they have a strict policy against selling cakes for same-sex weddings and ceremonies.

'Then Stephanie tried a little experiment. She called the bakery and told the owner, Jack Phillips, that she was planning to host a wedding celebration for two dogs.

'She told him that the dog wedding cake would need to feed 20 people and should be decorated with the names "Roscoe" and "Buffy."

'Without hesitation, Phillips quoted her a price and asked how soon she needed it.'

The incident was one of several which inspired legislation in at least 11 states that would have allowed business owners to cite their religious beliefs in denying service to patrons.

Most of the proposed laws, however, were knocked dead amid a national outcry that they would legalise discrimination.

Mr Phillips previously said he loved his work because it improves people's lives, and 'that's what Christ does'.

He added: 'In everything I do, I think about how 
people will perceive Christ through me, by what I sell, what I make'. One of his display cakes depicted a trio of crosses on a hill, with the words 'He Has Risen.'

He had not been deeply religious until after he fathered two children, when he was driving one day and had an epiphany. 'The Holy Spirit convicted me of my sin', he said.

The baker said he once employed a gay man 
in his shop and insisted he makes regular birthday cakes for a lesbian couple.

How it all began: The battle started almost two years ago when Mr Mullins posted this photo on Facebook

Campaign: The couple then stood in the streets with placards and the shop was inundated with calls

When Mr Craig and Mr Mullins were growing up, meanwhile, gay marriage was a foreign concept.

Mr Craig graduated from high school in Wyoming the same year Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, was killed because of his orientation.

He said he still feels awkward holding hands in public, adding: 'I feel like something bad could happen to us.'

An ACLU spokesman said: 'The Masterpiece owners have claimed their policy is based on their "reading of the Word of God."

'But their business is not a house of worship. Colorado law allows members of the clergy to decide whom they will join in a marriage or civil union – and that's consistent with the principles of religious liberty our nation was founded on.

'While bakery owners are free to practice their faith and to personally oppose same-sex marriage, they cannot use those beliefs as an excuse to disrespect and discriminate against customers.

'The store has no more right to turn away a gay couple than to turn away an interracial couple.'
