Wayne Rooney might have missed a few chances at one end of the pitch for Manchester United on Sunday but he was lucky not to give away a penalty at the other.

From a Tottenham corner late in the second half, Rooney grabbed hold of Harry Kane and hauled him to the ground, but referee Jonathan Moss did not award a penalty.

'I don't know what guidelines are going to make it any better,' said former Fulham captain Danny Murphy on Match of the Day on Sunday night.

'It is a penalty, he's not looking at the ball and he's denied him an opportunity to get on the end of the corner.'
