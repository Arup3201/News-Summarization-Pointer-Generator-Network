Manchester United's Anderson returned from a lunch date to find a £60 parking ticket on the front of £200,000 white Mercedes SLS on Wednesday afternoon.

The Brazilian had been out with a female friend to Wings Chinese in Manchester city centre and discovered the ticket when he arrived back at his car.

The former Porto man appeared unfazed by the ticket as he got into his top-of-the-range car.

Anderson has seen only 20 minutes of action this season under new United boss Louis van Gaal and it seems unlikely that he'll break into the starting 11.

The 26-year-old has started only six games in the past three seasons and it's believed that United are willing to listen to offers for him. 

His team mates travel to Loftus Road on Saturday to face Harry Redknapp's Queens Park Rangers and it remains to be seen if Anderson will be involved.

The Red Devils are just a point ahead of Arsenal in the Champions League places and know that they can't afford to slip up at the weekend.
