When the days get shorter and the weather colder, many of us no doubt envy those who have headed for a new life in the sun.

However, making such a move can actually leave us more miserable, according to research. A study of those who moved to a Mediterranean country found their levels of happiness were lower than those who had headed in the opposite direction.

And official figures from Spanish authorities show how 90,000 Brits packed up and left last year, fleeing the eurozone crisis, high unemployment and a crash in house prices.

Big changes: This couple may look happy, but scientists have found that those who move to the Mediterranean can end up more miserable than if they had stayed at home. Tom Utley agrees

Data from the National Institute of Statistics reveals how almost a quarter of Britons registered with local councils in Spain went home last year.

In all, 87,880 left Spain behind after a life in sun failed to live up to the dream.

In a separate study, University of Leicester researchers 
looked at 256 migrants from Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, 
France, and 73 from the UK, who relocated to Spain, Portugal, Greece and
 Cyprus in search of a new life.

The migrants were asked how happy they 
were on a scale of one to 10 compared with 56,000 people who stayed in 
the northern countries.

It was revealed that the migrants were less happy, scoring 7.3 out of ten, compared with the average of 7.5.

And the gap was even higher for Brits with migrants four per cent less happy than those back in Blighty.

Dr David Bartram analysed the data to take account of differences between migrants and those who stayed in terms of age, health, income, education, employment and religious beliefs, to make sure these factors did not distort the results.

Report: On average migrants were found to have higher incomes than the average in their new country

He said: 'The key finding from the analysis is that people from northern Europe who migrated to southern Europe are less happy than the stayers in northern Europe.'

On average the migrants were found to have higher incomes than the average in their new country, due to higher education levels.

Many previous studies suggest that these factors would result in a higher social status and levels of happiness.

However the paper, which will be presented at the British Sociological Association's annual conference in Leeds on Wednesday revealed that migration can disrupt social ties and make people less happy.

'Migration itself can be disruptive to other dimensions of people's lives- social ties, sense of belonging- possibly with consequences for their happiness,' said Dr Bartram.

'Perhaps any positive subjective consequences were outweighed by negative consequences arising from the more general disruptive effects of international migration on one's life.

'Within the European Union opportunities for such migration are abundant, and migration flows in this mode have reached significant dimensions.

'The analysis in this paper, however, raises doubts about whether migration in this mode will result in greater happiness for the migrants.'
