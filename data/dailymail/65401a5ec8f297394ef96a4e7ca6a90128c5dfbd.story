From dangling  on a broken zip wire to clumsily peddling himself around on a namesake bike, there's little Boris Johnson won't do for a good photograph.

But the Mayor seemed to have bitten off more than he could chew today when photographed gracelessly sampling local delicacies at a school in Yarm, North Yorkshire.  

With a plate piled high with Parmo and chips, the politician posed for cameras in a scene reminiscent of Ed Miliband's disastrous devouring of a bacon sandwich.

Elsewhere leader Nigel Farage was spotted bashfully tucking in to a Cornish pasty while campaigning in one of Ukip's target seats.

Boris Johnson was captured clumsily tasting local delicacies at a school in North Yorkshire in the latest of a string of bizarre photographs which show politicians eating awkwardly

An appetite for life: The London mayor looked quizzical as he made his way through the Middlesbrough dish 

Struggling: Nigel Farage fell into the same camp of awkward eaters after being snapped trying to tuck in to a Cornish pasty during a break from the campaign trail 

Like his Labour counterpart, the Tory Mayor of London may have been well advised to take smaller, fewer bites as he tried the Middlesbrough dish. 

Having shovelled fork fulls of chicken and cheese into his mouth Mr Johnson, who previously confessed to loving 'all food', summed up the meal as 'delicious', seemingly disappointed not to be able to finish it. 

In Redruth, Ukip leader Nigel Farage made his way through a flaky Cornish pasty while taking a break from the campaign trail. 

Keeping the paper bag it came in close to his chin to catch any crumbs, Mr Farage stretched his mouth around the snack to the delight of a passing photographer. 

Theirs are the latest in a bizarre string of awkward eating stunts carried out by British politicians sparked by Ed Miliband's encounter with a stubborn bacon buttie. 

Nestled in at a steel dining set Mr Miliband in New Covent Garden Market last May, the Labour leader wrestled with the sandwich to the amusement of assembled photographers. 

Parmo is flattened chicken breast smothered in bread crumbs and topped with bechamel sauce and cheddar cheese. 

Originally referred to as Chicken Parmesan, it is a favourite in takeaways across the North East.

It typically consists of chicken but pork is sometimes used instead. 

The dish is thought to have originated in a Middlesbrough takeaway around 40 years ago. 

His face contorted and mouth full, the photographs saw him accused of being further out of touch with ordinary people than ever before. 

In 2012 David Cameron was caught in a similarly embarrassing pose while enjoying a hot dog with President Obama. 

The Prime Minister was watching a basketball game with his American counterpart when the pair were snapped shoving mustard-glazed sausages into their mouths. 

During his visit to Yarm today Boris Johnson canvassed a group of teenagers for their support in the forthcoming election. 

He had travelled to the area to back MP James Wharton in his campaign for the seat of Stockton South.

Addressing a class of students he said: 'There's a dense umbilical connection between the two parts of the economy, that's why I have come all the way to Conyers School to tell you about this incredible link between London and Stockton.'

Disastrous: Ed Miliband wrestled with a bacon sandwich during a catastrophic photo opportunity last May which saw him accused of being further out of touch with voters than ever before
