Health risk: A reveller in casualty after drinking too much

Almost 900 more drinkers are admitted to hospital every day than five years ago, according to  shocking figures.

Official statistics show 1.1million people in England ended up in hospital through drink in 2009/10 – a 25 per cent rise in half a decade.

Liverpool is revealed as the nation’s  worst spot for drinkers ending up in casualty or on the wards.

Last year, there were 3,114 alcohol-related admissions per 100,000 people in the city – compared with just 850 per 100,000 on the Isle of Wight, the lowest level.

Shockingly, in many cases it is women ending up in hospital after having harmed their health through drink. Liverpool’s rate of alcohol-related hospital admission for women (517 per 100,000) was almost eight times the level in Wokingham, Berkshire.

Experts blame the ladette culture of binge drinking, the easy availability of cheap alcohol and 24-hour drinking for the frightening extent of drink-related problems on our streets and hospitals.

Other figures in the report show 7.6 per cent of drinkers are now considered at serious risk of jeopardising their health – rising to 16.1 per cent in the London borough of Hounslow.

That comes against a backdrop of increasing numbers suffering and dying from chronic liver disease.

Earlier this week the Daily Mail revealed £2.1billion will be spent on liver disease within five years – 2 per cent of the entire NHS budget.

The latest report, from the North West Public Health Observatory at Liverpool John Moores University, reveals Blackpool is the national liver disease capital, while West Somerset saw no deaths at all.

The study also contains new estimates on the number of people in England who drink nothing.

There are thought to be six million people over 16 who do not drink, with those from certain ethnic or religious backgrounds far more likely to abstain.

Almost half the population – 48 per cent – of the ethnically diverse east London borough of Newham are teetotallers, compared with just 6.3 per cent in the Isles of Scilly.

However, the Isles of Scilly also had the lowest rates of alcohol-related crime with just 1.15 per 1,000 residents. Official crime statistics show there were 392,787 crimes attributable to alcohol in 2010/11 – 7.6 crimes per 1,000 people.

The highest rates of crime linked to drinking by region occurred in London (11.7 crimes per 1,000 residents) while the North East had the lowest rate (5.7 per 1,000).

The city with the highest rate was Southampton, with 13.1, while the rate was nine in Leeds, nine in Liverpool and 7.4 in Newcastle.

Professor Mark Bellis, director of the North West Public Health Observatory, said: ‘The scale of damage revealed by these profiles shows alcohol is a problem for everyone in England. Cheap alcohol is no longer a commodity this country can afford.’

The report also estimated how many high-risk drinkers there are in each area. Excluding teetotallers, the rates range from 16.1 per cent in Hounslow to just 2.5 per cent in Peterborough.

Don Shenker, from charity Alcohol Concern, said: ‘It is clear this Government needs to do far more to tackle the problems all communities face in dealing with alcohol harms.’
