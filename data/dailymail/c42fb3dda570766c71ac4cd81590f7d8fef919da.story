A mother-of-two has been left with bald spots all over her head after her hair extensions were fitted with super glue.

Alexis Stanton, 38, from Linden in Beacon Lough, Gateshead was left in agony with a bleeding scalp and says she was left with no choice but to shave her all hair off.

Northumbria Police and Gateshead Council's trading standards officer John Herron is now investigating the incident involving a mobile beautician.

Alexis Stanton was left in agony with a bleeding scalp after she had her hair extensions fitted with superglue

She was in so much pain she decided to shave the extensions off and has been left with bald spots

Alexis said: 'I'm gobsmacked this has happened and I really wouldn't want this to happen to anybody else.

'I'm still in pain in my head. It's damaged my scalp. I've cried so much since it happened I don't think I've got any more tears left.'

She said she asked a mobile beautician who had previously done spray tans for her to fit the extensions believing that she knew what she was doing.

Halfway through the session - which was done in Alexis' kitchen - she said her scalp became really sore and by the evening the pain was unbearable.

She said she was told the new hair would 'slacken off' and the pain would ease the next day but 24 hours later she was still suffering.

It was only after a trip to a local hairdressers to get them removed was Alexis told they had in fact been fitted with super glue.

'You're meant to use keratin based glue which should dissolve under acetone,' said Alexis, who is mother to Elana, three, and Kalan, five.

'I'd had the hair plaited in and then the glue placed on top. It was really tight to my head to the point I was in tears. The hairdresser asked me to ring the person who had put them in, who told me it was superglue.

'It was so painful I ended up going to A&E and the doctors gave me steroid cream for my scalp. Immediately I knew there was something wrong. It's still red raw now.'

Alexis decided to get the extensions as a 38th birthday present to herself and said she bought fibre hair from a website recommended by the beautician.

Northumbria Police is now investigating the incident and is carrying out enquiries to establish what happened.

The
 beautician who fitted them claimed in a text message sent to the 
Newcastle Chronicle, who originally reported the incident, that she is 
not a hairdresser and that Alexis knew that.

She also said that the incident had been 'grossly exaggerated'.

Anneliese Hutchinson, Head of Development and Public Protection at Gateshead Council, said: 'Gateshead Trading Standards has received a complaint from Ms Stanton and we are investigating.'

Julie Tompkins, 44, a hairdresser at Brens Hair Beauty and Tanning, said in 14 years experience she had never seen hair extensions fitted with glue.

She said: 'Alexis came in last Tuesday and asked me to take them out and I just said it couldn't have been keratin-based glue because acetone normally breaks it down and it wouldn't.

'You would never, ever use superglue. She has been left with bald spots and was in so much pain she decided to shave them off.

'My advice would always be to use an experienced salon.'
