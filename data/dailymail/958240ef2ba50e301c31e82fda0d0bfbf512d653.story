This giant of the sea cracks a killer smile as he has a whale of a time catching his lunch in the wild.

The false killer whale may be 'saying cheese' for the photographer swimming alongside him or putting on the friendly face so he does not to scare away his prey.

The marine mammal has been given its name because of its striking resemblance to the killer whale.

Reasons not to be cheerful: The false killer whale population around Hawaii has been in sharp decline

But any similarities with the ferocious beast are quickly forgotten once you catch sight of the cute creature grinning from ear to ear.

The beaming cetacean was pictured hunting off the coast of Hawaii by American photographer Doug Perrine, 60.

He has been named Smiley and was seen in action close to Kona on the west of the Pacific island.

Like their namesakes, false killer whales are actually dolphins and not whales. But their friendly looks are deceiving, as they attack and eat other cetaceans.

Growing boy: Adult males can grow to nearly 20ft long, weigh up to two tonnes and live for around 60 years

False killer whales typically grow between 16 and 22 large, conical teeth on each jaw. They measure around 0.75ins in diameter from the gum line.

But the population living in waters around Hawaii has plenty of reason not to be so cheerful, having suffered signifant decline over the past 25 years.

According to the U.S. based National Marine Fisheries Service, around 400 false killer whales were seen in aerial surveys in 1989 but more recent studies estimate only 150 remain.

False killer whales usually prefer deep, open water, making the Hawaii population unique as it is the only one known to make it home close to land.

The decline is partially blamed on tuna and swordfish fishing, with false killer whales being caught unintentionally as by-catch.

Back on land, a bashful bear has been showing the happy go lucky false killer whale a thing or two about modesty.

The coy cub tried to hide from the camera after a hard day posing for pictures in  Kamchatka, Russia.

Gone fishing: The striking animal showed that he is as good a hunter in water as he is on dry land

Photographer Yury Sorokin, 30, from Moscow, who spent the day watching the playful bear, was just metres away when the camera shy bear closed his eyes and covered his face with his paw.

He said: 'The bear was fishing for red salmon in the lake and after eating a substantial dinner decided to have a rest in the sun.

'I think it was at that point that he decided enough was enough. He'd hardly paid any attention to me all day but once he'd exhausted himself and filled his belly I guess he just wanted to relax on his own without me taking pictures.

'I was overwhelmed with different emotions at the time, when I first spotted him I feared for my life but by the end of the day we had become quite close.

What's so funny? This chuckling cheetah looks like he was having a laugh in the hot Kenyan sun

'All of the time I was looking through my viewfinder because I didn't want to miss a shot. I guess he just got tired of posing in the end.'

In Masai Mara, Kenya, a cheeky cheetah grabbed photographer Callie De Wet's attention as the big cat was spotted chuckling to himself.

Such laughable behaviour, which Mr De Wet spied through his lens, is more fitting of a hyena then a cheetah

He said: 'I was snapping away at a family of cheetahs basking in the sun, when I spotted this one laughing away to himself.'
