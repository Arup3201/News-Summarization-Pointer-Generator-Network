The Bangladeshi factory where 112 workers were killed in a horrific fire was being used by major Western brands including Disney and Sears, it has been reported.

Documents and clothing in the charred remains of the factory link it with a range of brands who are alleged to have placed orders there.

Account books in the factory revealed that its management had taken orders from both Disney and Sears, as reported by AP.

Supermarket giant Wal-Mart and rap star Sean 'Diddy' Combs have also been linked to the Tazreen Fashions Ltd factory, prompting campaigners to call for better safety standards in Bangladesh's garment industry.

Blue and off-white shorts from Combs' ENYCE label were found stacked in containers and piled on the floor, while similar piles of clothing from Wal-Mart's Faded Glory brand were discovered among the remains.

Photographs have also emerged showing how some of the West's biggest firms had their garments made at the factory, located just outside Dhaka, with campaigners holding up the clothing.

Workers who survived the atrocity accused their bosses of locking the doors after fire alarms began to ring.

They said bosses demanded that staff should not leave the factory and alleged that fire extinguishers did not work within the factory.

Fire service officials said workers, who 
were mostly women, were unable to escape because there were not enough 
emergency exits. Some leapt to their deaths from windows.

Bangladesh is renowned for its textile industry that supplies major Western brands, however safety records at many factories are questionable.

Wal-Mart denied any knowledge of current dealings with the Tazreen factory.

The American store received an audit deeming the factory 'high-risk' last year and said that it had decided to stop doing business with the factory.

It said that a supplier had subcontracted to the factory nonetheless. Wal-Mart said that it has now stopped working with the subcontractor.

Local police said that three factory officials have been arrested at their homes in Savar, nearby the factory.

Police did not identify the factory officials or give their job status. They have not ruled out sabotage.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Interior Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir have said arson is suspected.

Saturday's fire has put a spotlight on global retailers that source clothes from Bangladesh, where the cost of labour is low - as little as $37 a month for some workers - and rights groups have called on firms to sign up to a fire safety program.

Bangladesh has around 4,500 garment 
factories that make clothes for brands including Tesco, Walmart, JC 
Penney, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour. Few of the 
factories take proper safety precautions.

Around 3,000 garment workers carried out protests for the third day running last night, blocking roads and hurling stones at factories, according to local television reports.

Officers dispersed the rioters using batons after the demonstrators forced most local factories to close their doors in order to avoid violence.

Dickies, a popular brand which sells work clothes and is based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it had concluded its production schedule with the factory earlier this year.

C&A, a European discount clothing retailer, confirmed the destroyed factory was producing an order of 220,000 sweaters for its operations in Brazil. One of its brands is called ACE.

It said in a statement it feels a deep sense of solidarity with the families who lost relatives in the fire.

US retailer Sears Holdings Corp said its clothing was not meant to be made in that textile factory, and was investigating reports that one of its brands had been found in the charred debris.

Other brands, such as Esprit Holdings Ltd , continued to deny any connection and distanced themselves from the disaster.

Two further incidents outside Dhaka - a fire at a factory on Monday morning and an explosion at a factory on Tuesday evening - had local manufacturers worried that their industry was being deliberately targeted.

Annisul Huq, former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the series of incidents naturally raises questions.

A workers' rights group claimed that staff in the factory were working overtime

Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker 
Rights Consortium, an American group working to improve conditions at 
factories abroad that make clothes for U.S. companies, said: ''The industry and parent brands in the U.S. have been warned again and 
again about the extreme danger to workers in Bangladesh and they have 
not taken action.'

Nova said the 
fire was the most deadly in the history of the Bangladesh apparel 
industry, and 'one of the worst in any country.'

'There's no question that Walmart and the other customers at this factory bear some blame for what happened in this factory,' Nova said.

Nova also said that Walmart 'knew exactly what's going on at these facilities. They have staff on site in Bangladesh.'

Walmart actually warned of dangerous conditions at the Tazreen factory last year, in a letter posted online by the factory owner.

In a statement, Walmart told ABC News, 
'Our thoughts are with the families of the victims of this tragedy. ... 
[F]ire safety is a critically important area of Wal-Mart's factory audit
program and we have been working across the apparel industry to improve
fire safety education and training in Bangladesh.

'As part of this effort, we partnered
with several independent organizations to develop and roll out fire 
safety training tools for factory management and workers. Continued 
engagement is critical to ensure that reliable, proactive measures are 
in place to reduce the chance of factory fires.'

According to reports, the death toll 
is still rising. By Sunday morning, firefighters had recovered 100 
bodies, fire department Operations Director Maj. Mohammad Mahbub said, though the death toll could rise as crews search the charred debris.

Another further 12 people who had suffered injuries after jumping from the building to escape the fire later died at hospitals.

The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear. Mr Mahbub said the fire broke out on the ground floor, which is used as a warehouse, and spread quickly to the upper floors.

'The factory had three staircases, 
and all of them were down through the ground floor,' he said. 'So the 
workers could not come out when the fire engulfed the building.

'Had there been at least one emergency exit through outside the factory, the casualties would have been much lower.'

Mr Mahbub said firefighters recovered 69 bodies from the second floor of the factory alone. He said most of the victims had been trapped inside the factory with no emergency exits leading outside the building.

Many workers who had taken shelter on
the roof of the factory were rescued, but firefighters were unable to 
save those who were trapped within.

Army
soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed to help police 
keep the situation under control as thousands of onlookers and anxious 
relatives of the factory workers gathered at the scene, Mahbub said.

He would not say how many people were still missing.

The
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the apex 
body of the garment sector, said the association would stand by the 
victims' families.
