A daughter poured a cup of lighter fluid over her sex offender dad and set him on fire before leaving his house while he burned to death, police said.

Nina Holbrook, 30, allegedly set alight dad Carl Holbrook, 50, of Wayne County, Indiana, before passing a neighbour and giving him a ‘thumbs-up’.

She allegedly told him to come inside his house and set about the horrific attack before telling her uncle what she had just done outside.

Mr Holbrook has been convicted of two sex crimes in 1995 and 2007, when he was jailed for criminal deviate behaviour, reported True Crime Report.

He was waiting outside his home last Friday for a visitor when Ms Holbrook asked him to come inside to discuss something.

But inside a bedroom she poured lighter fluid over his head and ignited it with a candle before he began to burn to death, police said.

She allegedly calmly left the house while he screamed, and bumped into her uncle Harvey Holbrook, whom Mr Holbrook had been waiting for.

She told her uncle: 'I torched him', reported the Palladium-Item.

He found Mr Holbrook with most of his clothes singed, before he was taken to a local hospital and died from his injuries soon after.

Ms Holbrook then bumped into her neighbour Kyle Carpenter and allegedly told him she had set her father on fire while smiling.

He is said to have asked her: 'Are you alright?' She allegedly smiled and replied: 'No sir, I'm fine. Thank you very much.'

Mr Carpenter claimed she then gave him a thumbs-up sign.

Police are yet to establish a motive in the killing. Ms Holbrook has been charged with felony murder and arson. She is being held without bond.

The exact nature of Mr Holbrook’s past sex crimes is not yet known but he was not a registered sex offender, according to Sheriff's Office records.
