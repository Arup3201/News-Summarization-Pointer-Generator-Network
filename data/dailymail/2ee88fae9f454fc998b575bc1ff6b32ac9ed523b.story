A white sports columnist is facing outrage after he compared the tattooed quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers to the residents of San Quentin state prison.

Sporting News writer David Whitley has been labeled a racist by some for his sweeping generalisations after he penned an article that bemoaned the amount of tattoos that 25-year-old Colin Kaepernick had on his body.

Claiming that the position of quarterback is hallowed and Kaepernick's body art brings it down in tone, Whitley said that because of his tattoos, the 49ers player can never be a legitimate hero.

But he later defended himself against accusations of racism, saying: 'If they were old enough to read, my two adopted African-American 
daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out I'm a racist.'

“It didn’t occur to me that admitting I’m not a fan of body art would be admitting I don’t like African-Americans.'

It is the extensive body art of Colin Kaepernick - the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers that has so upset sports columnist David Whitely

The furious response overwhelmed Whitley, who had to fend off accusations of racial profiling, prompting his editor-in-chief to take the unusual step of writing a defence of the opinion piece in which he admitted Whitley could have finessed certain points.

Whitley, who is the father of two adopted African-American daughters, was even criticised by Kaepernick's parents - who revealed that his tattoos are in fact verses from the Bible.

The column which was published on Wednesday, seems to take aim at the new tattoed breed of sporting stars and declare that it is inappropriate for someone in his position on the team to possess them.

'San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick is going to be a big-time NFL quarterback. That must make the guys in San Quentin happy,' wrote Whitley in AOL FanHouse.

'Approximately 98.7 per cent of the inmates at California's state prison have tattoos. I don't know that as fact, but I've watched enough Lockup to know it's close to accurate.'

He continued: 'NFL quarterback is the ultimate position of influence and responsibility. He is the CEO of a high profile organisation, and you don't want your CEO to look like he just got paroled.'

Warming to his theme, Whitley argues that quarterbacks are different from the rest of professional athletes and should be 'the last line of defence against the raging sea of ink'.

'For dinosaurs like me,' continues Whitley, 'NFL quarterbacks were our little Dutch boys. The original hero stuck his finger in the dyke to save Holland.

'Pro QBs were the last line of defense against the raging sea of ink. When our kids said they wanted a tattoo, we could always point to the Manning brothers.'

Condemnation of the columnists comments was swift, with Kaepernick's adoptive parents expressing their anger to USA Today.

'It annoyed me,' said his mother Teresa Kaepernick.

'You are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos? Really? Saying other guys are role models because they don't have them? Really?

Some of these other guys don't have crystal clear reputations. That's how you're going to define this kid? It's pretty irritating is what it is.'

Responding to the fury, Sporting News editor-in-chief Garry D. Howard wrote a story explaining his employees column.

'Whitley’s message was somewhat lost in his flurry of one-liners, but his intention was sincere and honest,' wrote Howard.

'As a sports editor who also happens to be African-American, it is my job to vet each and every opinion piece to ensure that the message does not get lost and I certainly could have done more, in retrospect, to make sure it did not.'

Indeed in his column, Whitley attempts to preemptively refute any racist overtones.

'It's not just a white thing, I hope,' wrote Whitley as publisher AOL added a disclaimer to the bottom of the column, saying the piece did not necessarily reflect the company's position.

Responding to the criticism he received, Whitley refuted any suggestions that he was racist.

'It didn’t occur to me that admitting I’m not a fan of body art would be admitting I don’t like African-Americans,' he told his website.

'I’m pretty sure the middle-aged women at the gym with barbed-wire tats that I referenced are white.

'If they were old enough to read, my two adopted African-American daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out I’m a racist.'

Expressing his rage at the author, Rick Kaepernick, Colin's father said that Whitley should have focused on his son's charity work and not his body art.

'This guy has probably never talked to Colin,' Rick said. 'Instead of saying that Colin does all these great things and donates his time to children, this guy is going to make him out like a gangster. Really? I guess you just have to roll with the punches.'

'Somebody asked me if I got mad about that. I said no. It's just a guy and his opinion. I could have an opinion about him, but I've never met the guy, so I don't know if my opinion would be right.'
