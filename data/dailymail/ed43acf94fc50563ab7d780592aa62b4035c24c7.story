PSV's Jetro Willems received the fastest red card in Dutch league history after he was dismissed with just 29 seconds on the clock against NAC Breda.

20-year-old Willems lunged in rashly on Gill Swerts inside the first minute, but didn't appear to touch the midfielder before being sent off.

But the Eredivisie leaders went on to win 2-0 and extend their lead to 12 points over Ajax after Memphis Depay and captain Georginio Wijnaldum struck in the second half.

The leaders' night at the Rat Verlegh Stadium got off to a dreadful start as Willems, returning after missing the last game with flu, was harshly sent off for a challenge on Swerts.

Willems was rash in his challenge on Swerts, seconds after being dispossessed by the Breda midfielder, but actually made no contact with his opponent.

The game struggled to gain momentum after that incident and it was not until the 48th minute that Breda's Adnane Tighadouini had the first shot on target for either side.

PSV went ahead in the 53rd minute as Adam Maher seized possession and drove a long crossfield ball into the box. Breda goalkeeper Jelle ten Rouwelaar was slow to react at Depay turned in from six yards.

Georginio Wijnaldum then put the Eredivisie leaders 2-0 up in the 74th minute

Guyon Fernandez had a chance to level but shot straight at Jeroen Zoet and Wijnaldum made the game safe for PSV after 74 minutes, driving into the box and smashing a shot into the roof of the net.

Depay might have made victory more comfortable but missed his kick in front of goal after Abel Tamata stretched the home defence and whipped in a dangerous cross.
