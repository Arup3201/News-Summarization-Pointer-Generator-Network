Police should mount patrols at polling stations in 16 towns and cities to combat vote-rigging, Britain’s elections watchdog warns today.

The Electoral Commission has identified a list of areas considered ‘vulnerable’ to voting fraud. 

The at-risk areas include Britain’s second city Birmingham, the scene of a notorious ballot-rigging case in 2004 which the presiding judge said would ‘disgrace a banana republic’.

Many of the areas identified have large south Asian communities, but the watchdog says it would be a ‘mistake’ to think electoral fraud only takes place within them.

It warns, however, there is particular concern at the ‘vulnerability of some South Asian communities, specifically those with roots in parts of Pakistan or Bangladesh, to electoral fraud’.

It goes on: ‘The evidence and views we have heard raise significant questions about whether individuals within these communities are able effectively to exercise their right to vote, and whether they are able to participate in elections on the same basis as other electors across the UK.’ 

The watchdog says it is also commissioning more work into voting fraud within the South Asian community. Concerns include whether men pressure their wives and children to vote in a particular way.

Today’s report calls for increased police involvement in elections in 16 parts of England. As well as Birmingham, they include: Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford, Burnley, Calderdale, Coventry, Derby, Hyndburn, Kirklees, Oldham, Pendle, Peterborough, Slough, Tower Hamlets, Walsall, and Woking.

All 16 areas have a history of alleged voting fraud. At one point the Electoral Commission considered a total ban on postal voting in these areas in order to combat fraud. But, following a public consultation, it decided this would unfairly hit many ordinary people who need to vote by post.

Instead it has urged the police to mount patrols at polling stations during future elections in the 16 named areas and target more resources at investigating allegations of electoral fraud, which critics complain have been a low priority for the police.

Returning officers have also been urged to take ‘sustained action’ to identify suspect patterns of voting and voter registration.

The report also calls for voters to be required to show photo ID at polling stations.

And it calls for political parties to be banned from handling postal ballots under any circumstances.

The watchdog says it will call for a change in the law to ban political activists from handling postal ballots if they refuse to comply with a new code of conduct.

Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who has campaigned for action to tackle vote-rigging, welcomed the report but said further action was needed.

‘Greater involvement of the police would be welcome because intimidation is an issue – I am aware of incidents of polling clerks being intimidated into handing over ballot papers to party representatives. 

‘The whole issue of what happens in polling stations needs more attention. I would like to see filming inside polling stations, not of how people vote, but of what else goes on.’

Overall, the commission found electoral fraud was ‘not widespread’, but added: ‘Despite this, a significant proportion of the public remain concerned that it is taking place.’
