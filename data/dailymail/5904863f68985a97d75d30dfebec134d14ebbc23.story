Millions of people were cramming themselves aboard trains on Bangladesh's huge rail network yesterday, desperate to make it home in time for the Eid holiday.

With most boats and trains full to overflowing, there were serious safety fears. These were realised in at least one spot where a man was killed after falling under a train.

Horrified onlookers, including several children, crowded around the victim's remains, which were scattered in at least two places along the tracks near Airport Railway Station in Dhaka, the capital.

But the tragedy did not seem to scare anyone off their perilous journeys, with most passengers perched atop speeding railway carriages taking them from work in the cities to rural hometowns.

With nearly Muslims comprising 90 per cent of Bangladesh's 160million people and a population density higher than the tiny island of Jersey, the scale of the exodus is beyond biblical.

Eid al-Adha, Islam's 'Festival of the sacrifice', commemorates's Abraham's willingness to kill his own son in submission to God's command. It begins tonight and lasts for four days.

This year the preparations for the holiday have been thrown into controversy after officials warned millions of cows set for slaughter have been fattened up with banned steroids.

Industry officials told the AFP news agency at least ten million cows and goats are expected to be slaughtered during the festival. But experts fear many have been fattened with cancer-causing steroids in a bid to cash in on the surging demand for meat.

'In our estimate some 20 per cent of the cattle to be sold during Eid are being fattened with banned steroids such as dexamethasone,' said Muzaffar Hossain, a professor of animal science at the Bangladesh Agriculture University.

Cows fattened with such steroids can help farmers earn an extra $400-$1,000 per animal but can cause serious health problems for consumers, he said.

'As a result, the use of steroids and other harmful drugs has become rampant all over the country,' he told AFP.

Ali Noor, joint secretary at the livestock ministry, said only a small number of farmers were using the steroids, with the vast majority using a government-prescribed natural cow fattening formula.

But he said authorities have deployed 20 medical teams in Dhaka's cattle markets to try to detect sick animals and more teams were being sent to major markets across the country.

'We are also asking the authorities to deploy magistrates to act against the use of steroids to fatten cows. These magistrates will set up mobile courts to hand out sentences against the perpetrators,' he told AFP.

On Monday the mass-circulation Daily Star ran an investigative report that said almost every farm in the country's northwest, the main cattle region, was using the banned steroids.

'If someone consumes the meat of the cattle fattened with such steroids, it may cause cancer and kidney failure,' Abdus Samad, a professor of Bangladesh Agriculture University, told the paper.

Acting on a petition, the High Court on Monday asked the government to investigate the racket and prepare guidelines for its control.

Eid al-Adha is the second of Islam's two Eid holidays, after Eid al-Fitr, and marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

Like Eid al-Fitr, the holiday involves special religious observances, charitable donations, social and family get-togethers, gift giving and traditional South Asian feasting.

But, reflecting its scriptural basis, there is also the added element of sacrifice, with many families offering up a sheep, goat or even a cow - with one third of the meat given to the poor and the needy.
