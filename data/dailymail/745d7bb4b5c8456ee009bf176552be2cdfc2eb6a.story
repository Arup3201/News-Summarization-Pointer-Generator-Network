There's a bitter battle being fought on the High Street between retail titans Marks & Spencer and John Lewis. What are they fighting over? Well, that would be you, Mrs Middle England. It seems that every move M&S makes, John Lewis quickly copies it.

Take the surprising similarities between John Lewis's spring/summer own-brand catalogue for the industry, released late last month, and M&S's, which came out in November. The pictures of models in little stripy dresses, floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable.

Femail put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist ANNE HAMLYN, founder of fashion consultancy company DressMe, to give her verdict...

John Lewis: Somerset by Alice Temperley wide-leg trousers, £99, and silk jacket, £140

M&S: Jacket, £69, and Per Una trousers, £55

Wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers, which are an on-trend look this season. The John Lewis print is lovely. The Alice Temperley trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire John Lewis collection.

Yes, they're a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes, but definitely worth it.  You could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work.  And thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg, you could dress them up for a sexier look at night.

These trousers would be  flattering whatever your size. Sadly, M&S misses the mark. Its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you'd sell in a Christmas party range, not put in a spring collection.  I'm not a fan of the trousers either, particularly after seeing the excellent John Lewis version.

These are creased even on the hanger and they're cut very straight at the hip, which is going to be a problem for pear-shaped women.  One good thing is that they're properly lined, so at least your knickers won't show through the white fabric. Personally, I'd spend the extra money and buy the Temperley trousers at John Lewis.

WINNER: John Lewis

John Lewis: Cashmere jumper, £69, and Collection pink trousers, £59

M&S: Pink cashmere jumper, £65, and Per Una pink trousers, £59

Both retailers have gone for acid brights, with varying degrees of success.  The John Lewis sweater is dull and dated - it's limp on the hanger, so it's going to look awful after a bit of wear. The rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap.

On the other hand, the trousers are well-cut, with ample room round the bottom. They've designed them with women's curves in mind. Knitwear is one of M&S's strong suits and this jumper is lovely. The longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive.  The cashmere is much heavier than the John Lewis version, despite the fact they're almost the same price.

However, the trousers, are not good. The crotch is too low and there's too much fabric in the waistband. And why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side?

WINNER: M&S for cashmere, JOHN LEWIS for trousers

John Lewis: Dress, £89

M&S: Navy and ivory dress, £35 

The John Lewis dress would suit any age. It's beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape.  The nautical look isn't overdone (no sailor collars or brass buttons), so it could work in the office or at a wedding. The fabric is a little bit retro, which again will appeal to an older woman.

Nautical stripes aren't a particular trend for 2014, but they're a spring/summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and I think John Lewis have executed this look well.

Oh dear - then we come to M&S. I wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this? It's too floppy and girly to wear to work, but too prim to be sexy.  The scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively, particularly at the seams.  Yes, it's cheap, but I just can't see many people looking good in it.

WINNER: John Lewis

John Lewis: Collection white dress, £79, johnlewis.com

M&S: Per Una dress with leather panels, £199, marksandspencer.com

At first glance, these dresses are similar - until you put them on.  Though a fitted, white dress isn't the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim, John Lewis has made their cotton version as flattering as possible.

The waist seam curves upwards slightly, drawing the eye away from the tummy. And the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette.  Then there's the M&S version, which I really don't like.  Yes, they've picked fashion- forward snakeskin-esque fabric (which feels rather cheap to me), but it's clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps.  Then there's that high neckline, which makes even our model look broad-shouldered.

I'm surprised this is from Per Una, which is where I often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20.  I can't for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress, or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it.  And the final blow is that it's more than double the price of John Lewis's version. My advice is to steer clear.

WINNER: John Lewis

John Lewis: Floral print top, £49, and trousers, £59

M&S: Autograph floral top, £65, and trousers, £75

The John Lewis shirt is just about OK if you want to get this on-trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong, but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team? Look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it's even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line.

It's a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person. If I were a betting woman, I'd say these will be on the sale rail before long. I'm also not convinced by the M&S boxy floral top.

I don't think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy. But the M&S trousers are brilliant. Despite being a critic of the store's normal range, there's often much better tailoring in the Autograph collection than in Per Una.

The M&S designers have really thought about this print. It's not so huge that it will dwarf a little person, but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider. I'd wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse. The designers have made a very good job of this fashion-forward look.

WINNER: M&S
