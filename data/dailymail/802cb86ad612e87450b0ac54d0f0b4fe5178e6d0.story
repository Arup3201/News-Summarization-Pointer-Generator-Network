Probe: All French ministers have to open their accounts to the Government after former French Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac admitted having offshore assets

France has ordered all government ministers to publicly declare their assets in the wake of revelations that an ex-cabinet member hid up to £12million from the tax-man in a Swiss bank.

The confession by former budget minister Jerome Cahuzac that he 'lied to the president' about dodging tax has sent shockwaves through the deeply unpopular socialist administration.

Foreign minister Laurent Fabius was also forced to deny rumours on Monday that he also had a secret Swiss bank account.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has now given all ministers until April 15 to publish details of their assets in a desperate bid to restore credibility to the government.

A law on financial transparency among ministers and other top officials will also be adopted by the summer, he said in a statement.

Measures would also be taken to 'more severely punish breaches of the financial law, ethics and integrity', Mr Ayrault said.

Critics have accused Hollande and his ministers of knowing about and covering up Cahuzac's tax dodging and of mismanagement for having believed his denials.

A poll this week also revealed three out of five French people want a government re-shuffle - a move that President Hollande has rejected.

The Cahuzac scandal and the latest accusations targeting Fabius have come as a massive new blow to Hollande, who made a key manifesto pledge to crack down on tax dodging.

The damaging revelations have also erupted as Hollande's popularity is plunging faster and lower than any other modern French president to 22 per cent.

He is facing attacks from all sides that he has failed to keep his manifesto promises to reduce the ballooning public deficit and cut 10.6 per cent unemployment - the highest level since 1997.

And his main election pledge to tax all earnings over one million euros (£850,000) at 75 per cent has been thrown out by the Constitutional Court.

But even that hasn't stopped a flood of high profile millionaires, including actor Gerard Depardieu and France's richest man Bernard Arnault, fleeing abroad to 'wealth-friendly' countries.

His presidency has also been blighted by the massive unpopularity of his girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, who has been accused of abandoning her socialist principles for a life of 'luxury and frivolity'.

The First Lady was 'indifferent' to the plight of millions of struggling families as she cavorted with the nation's wealthy elite, weekly news magazine VSD said.

But the president does still have one fervent hotbed of supporters - three thousand miles away in Mali, where he is being hailed as hero after successfully sending in French troops to crush a takeover by extremist Islamist rebels.
