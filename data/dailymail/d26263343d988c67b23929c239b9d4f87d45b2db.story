The easy thing to do would have been to let someone else step up. With time ticking by and a game slipping away, Adam Lallana knew exactly what was at stake when Liverpool won a corner.

This was their last chance to salvage a point against Arsenal and the wrong delivery would have been greeted with a mix of derision and exasperation by the Kop.

Those without sufficient mental strength would have been inclined to pass on such responsibility.

Lallana, however, did not flinch. He ended up delivering the perfect set-piece, inviting Martin Skrtel to thunder in a header and secure a 2-2 draw. If the centre back’s goal on Sunday has the potential to change Liverpool’s season, the assist could be vital for the man who provided it.

Things have not been straight-forward for Lallana since his £23.7million summer switch from Southampton. 

He has sat out big games, nursed injuries and struggled for form but his persistence and determination cannot be questioned. The evidence was there for all to see last Sunday when it mattered.

‘When you’re not playing well and results aren’t going well, it’s easy to hide and not want the ball,’ said Lallana. ‘But that’s where you have to work through because eventually it will click. Something good will happen, you will gain confidence and you’ll have a good impact.’

Few would dispute that Lallana, who has been playing with broken ribs, would benefit from a change of fortune; they would also find it difficult to argue with the fact he has looked a different player since Brendan Rodgers reverted to a 3-4-3 formation and let Liverpool attack once more.

There have been signs over the past fortnight that, perhaps, Liverpool are about to leave behind the form that made their autumn so wretched. The atmosphere at Anfield was certainly lifted by the manner in which they attacked Arsenal from the start.

A shortage of confidence, undoubtedly, had been an issue for Liverpool’s players — not just Lallana — but they now have a prime opportunity to start building momentum, given their festive fixture list begins on Boxing Day against Burnley at Turf Moor and includes home dates with Swansea and Leicester.

‘I think we’re getting a bit of confidence and rhythm in our game,’ said the 26-year-old, who celebrated his first wedding anniversary on Christmas Eve.

It has been a difficult start to life at Anfield for Lallana, but he is beginning to show why he cost so much

‘We’re causing teams problems, so we can gain belief from that. The lads were lacking a bit of confidence.

‘That comes with disappointing results. Anyone in the game will tell you that you have these points in your career when you have got to show a bit of bottle, where you’ve got to go looking for the ball. We’ve had that and it’s about keeping on going into work, wanting to come back strong.

‘There’s been a lot of talk in-house that we have to stick together as a squad. When you’re not playing well, everyone will be up against you, wanting you to slip up. So it has been about us sticking together. We know we have character and a great dressing room.’

What Lallana says also works in Liverpool’s favour is the presence of Rodgers, the manager who was so desperate to sign him. Liverpool’s group may have been stung by criticism but Rodgers has ensured they have not lost focus.

‘He’s been fantastic with me and the group as a whole,’ Lallana explained. ‘I’m sure he’s found it difficult as well. You cannot always ignore what people write and say. But it’s about sticking together and that’s what he’s mentioned — we stick together no matter how many people have their opinions.

‘There are reasons (Liverpool are not fighting for the title like last year) and people might not like the reasons but it’s up to us, step by step, to gradually get back to where the lads were last year. Over the last couple of games I think we have found a system to suit and that’s credit to the manager.’

In Rodgers' new 3-4-3 formation Lallana is starting to rediscover his superb form from Southampton

Will 3-4-3 be the key to Liverpool staging a revival in the new year? Lallana will not make any bold declarations but he is quick to point out that the season, come May, might yet be judged as a triumph, given the avenues that are open.

‘We’re in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup (against Chelsea) — I can’t wait for that,’ said Lallana. 

‘We’ve also got a good run of games coming up in the league, where, if we put in performances like we did against Arsenal, we’ll have a strong chance of picking up points.’
