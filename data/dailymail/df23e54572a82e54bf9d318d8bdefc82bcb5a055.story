A 16-year-old West Virginia girl who disappeared last summer has been found dead, less than 30 miles from her home.

The remains of Syklar Neese were found on January 16 in rural Wayne Township in Greene County, Pennsylvania, but they were only recently positively identified.

The teen, from
Star City, West Virginia, was last seen on July 7 when she was spotted 
on surveillance footage getting into a friend's car at midnight.

Where did she go? Last time she was seen Skylar returned from shift at Wendy's and hugged parents before saying she was going to bed

Police initially labeled her a runaway and never issued an Amber Alert, despite her parents believe she was in danger.

Authorities have released no details about how her body was found or its condition.

The last sighting of the brunette teen was when she returned home from her job at Wendy's and hugged her parents before going to bed saying she was tired.

Footage from the James Place apartments showed that Skylar climbed out of a window at midnight and got into a waiting car, which police later found out belonged to one of her friends.

Skylar's cousin Rikki Woodall, told The Huffington Post: 'The police interviewed the friend and she admitted she picked Skylar up
that night but swears she dropped her off an hour later.

The girl said 
Skylar was insistent that she be dropped off down the street so her 
friend's car did not wake anyone.'

Publicity: Skyar's parents have led a very public hunt for their beloved daughter with posters and T-shirts

According to police, there is no surveillance footage of Skyler returning to the apartment complex.

'We
know she left voluntarily from the surveillance tape, but we have not 
been able to account for her whereabouts since then,' Star City Police 
Chief Vic Propst told Huffington Post.

The last message on her Twitter account was posted on July 5.

The message reads, 'You doing s*** like that is why I will NEVER completely trust you.'

Skylar's family have led a publicity drive to find the missing teen.

A
few weeks after her disappearance, her friends and family gathered 
outside of the Wal-Mart in the University Town Center in Granville to 
sell T-shirts with her name and picture.

The money raised by the sale was used as a reward to for anyone with information of her whereabouts - so far it totals $3,100. Â 

Skylar is described as a white female, 5'4" tall, 135 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.
