Mothers of the bride and groom will be added to marriage registers for the first time, David Cameron announced today.

The Prime Minister said the change – the first in 150 years – addressed ‘another inequality in marriage’.

The current system, which dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign, only records the fathers’ names. But Mr Cameron said this did not reflect modern Britain.

David Cameron, speaking at the Relationships Alliance Summit at the Royal College of GP's in central London this morning, said mothers should be included on the marriage register

Marriage certificates in England and Wales only record the names of  couples fathers  - not mothers

He said Britain had recently sent a ‘powerful message’ by legalising gay marriage but needed to go further.

It comes after tens of thousands of campaigners signed a petition calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates.

There is space for the name of the father of the bride and the father of the groom and their occupations

Today, Mr Cameron said: 'We're going to address another inequality in marriage too.

'The content of marriage registers in England and Wales has not changed since the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign.

'At the moment, they require details of the couples' fathers but not their mothers.

'This clearly doesn't reflect modern Britain – and it's high time the system was updated. So I have asked the Home Office to look at how we can address this too.'

The petition calling for mothers’ names to be included on the certificate, published on the campaigning website change.org, appeals for a move away from the view in which marriage is seen as ‘a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom’.

The last change to the marriage register rules took place during the reign of Queen Victoria, the Prime Minister said today

Currently, in England and Wales, marriage certificates include space for the name of the Father of the Bride and the Father of the Groom, with separate boxes allocated to each of their occupations.

The mothers of the happy couple are excluded from this official documentation.

Civil partnership certificates, as well as Scottish and Northern Irish marriage certificates, do supply room for the names of the bride and groom's mothers.

According to the petitioner, the lack of mothers' names on marriage certificates in England and Wales ‘is part of a much wider pattern of inequality. Women are routinely silenced and written out of history.’

The format of the English and Welsh marriage certificate has remained unchanged since the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1837.

Mr Cameron’s announcement that mothers’ names would be added to the marriage certificate came in a speech in central London this morning in which he called for more to be done to help families.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the speech, he insisted he was not judging single parents and couples who split up by praising traditional families.

He said single parents did ‘an absolutely brilliant job in bringing up children’.

He added: ‘There are some cases where it is better for parents to split up.

‘I wouldn't for one minute want to stop that. But where you can help people come together and stay together, then surely the government should play its part.’

Government figures also show Britain has 500,000 ‘troubled families’, costing the state more than £30billion a year.

He announced there would be a new ‘family friendly test’, to ensure every new policy does not damage family life.
