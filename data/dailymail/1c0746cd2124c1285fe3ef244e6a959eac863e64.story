Celtic have vowed to help John Guidetti contest an SFA charge after the compliance officer cited the striker for allegedly making an offensive comment on Dutch TV.

Interviewed by a TV station in Holland, the former Feyenoord striker is said to have made a slur against Rangers while relating the words of a song Parkhead supporters sing in his honour.

The Swede, who is on loan from Manchester City, is alleged to have breached disciplinary rule 73. He has until next Monday to reply to the charge with a principal hearing date scheduled for April 9.

Celtic, however, voiced their astonishment that the matter had got this far, spokesperson saying: ‘We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel. John Guidetti will be defending this charge.’

Meanwhile, the club has been hit with a combined £9,460 fine for two UEFA charges of misconduct during the second leg of last month’s Europa League showdown with Inter Milan in Italy.

A penalty of £5,860 was imposed for ‘improper conduct’ on the field as well as a £3,600 punishment for flares set off by fans at the San Siro.

Defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off for two bookable offences, while five other players were booked in the 1-0 loss which saw Ronny Deila’s men eliminated 4-3 on aggregate.

It’s the seventh time the club has been in hot water with the governing body in four years.

Inter were also fined £3600 for their supporters letting off fireworks.

Celtic responded to the latest fine in a statement which read: ‘Clearly, Celtic Football Club is disappointed by today’s decisions.

‘It should be noted that Celtic players have an excellent disciplinary record in European football over many years and in Scotland, Celtic has been top of the league’s disciplinary table for the last three years, something which we are rightly proud of.

‘Again, it is disappointing that the actions of one or two individuals within a support of well over 3,000, have let the club down by using flares at this match.’
