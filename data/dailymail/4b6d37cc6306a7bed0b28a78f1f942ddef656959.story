ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has says that his comment to women that 'you can do your part' not to incite domestic violence from men was the 'most egregious error' of his career during a prerecorded apology aired on First Take today.

ESPN issued a statement shortly after Smith's apology saying that it demonstrates that 'he recognizes his mistakes and has a deeper appreciation of our company values.'

Smith explains that when discussing Ray Rice's two-game suspension last Friday for knocking his fiancee unconscious, 'my words came across that it was somehow a woman's fault.'

Tape talk: Stephen A. Smith apologized to ESPN viewers for insinuating that women 'provoke' domestic abuse from men

'This was not my intent. It is not what I was trying to say,' he adds.

Cohost
 Cari Champion added that 'provoke' can be a trigger word for abuse victims.

The ESPN2 program then quickly cut to a live on-air roundtable about LeBron James and there was 
no further discussion about Smith's comments.

Smith made the 'provoke' comments during a discussion of the NFL being too lenient
 on Rice, the Baltimore Ravens player who was captured on camera 
knocking out his 
then-fiancee (now wife) at an Atlantic City casino and 
dragging her limp body from the elevator.

Smith stated that no man 
should ever hit a woman, but added that women, for their part, can take responsibility for avoiding that abuse.

'Let's make sure we don’t do anything to provoke wrong actions,' he said.

Smith has spoken about abuse before when
 Bengals player Chad Johnson was arrested for domestic battery, saying 
that Johnson 'put himself in this situation' because of 'who he 
married.'

The
 harshest criticism of Smith came from within the ESPN organization, 
with SportsNation cohost Michelle Beadle expressing her disgust last 
Friday.

Scathing: Beadle didn't hold back in her condemnation of Smith's comments

Victim-blaming: Beadle alluded to the victim-blaming culture surrounding rape

In another tweet, Beadle said, 'I'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend...I'd hate to think what I'd be asking for by doing so @stephenasmith. #dontprovoke.'

She went on: 'Violence isn't the victim's issue. It's the abuser's. To insinuate otherwise is irresponsible and disgusting. Walk. Away.'

Smith reacted to criticism with a long Twitter rant that has since been deleted.

Lenient punishment: Ray Rice was caught on camera knocking his then-fiancee out cold and dragging her body from a casino elevator and was given a two-game suspension

'Enough is enough,' he wrote. 'I simply asked: now what about the other side … what about addressing women on how they can help prevent the obvious wrong being done upon them?'

In subsequent tweets, he essentially reiterated the comments he made on-air.

The recent taped segment echoes a statement that was issued on Friday after Smith's tweets, in which he said that he does 'not believe a woman provokes the horrible domestic abuses that are sadly such a major problem in our society.'

He also apologized if his comments were taken to convey anything other than his condemnation of violence against women.
