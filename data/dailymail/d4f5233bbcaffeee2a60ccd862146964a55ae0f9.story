Labour junket king Barry Gardiner faced new flak last night over plans to defy Ed Miliband and go on another all-expenses-paid trip to Mexico, funded by a climate change lobby group.

Mr Gardiner, Labour’s environment spokesman who is responsible for the party’s floods policy, issued a grovelling apology last week after The Mail on Sunday revealed how he left the deluged UK to spend a week in Mexico with his wife Caroline.

But party insiders say he is threatening to refuse to scrap plans to visit the country again in June on another free trip. That could even lead to him being fired from Labour’s front bench.

Much of Mr Gardiner's travel has been funded by a lobbying group, Globe International

Mr Gardiner was carpeted by Labour Chief Whip Rosie Winterton on Monday after this newspaper revealed how flights and a week-long stay at a £325-a-night hotel for the MP and his wife were paid for by a pharmaceuticals firm run by a Labour donor.

We also disclosed how Brent North MP Mr Gardiner, who is Labour’s ‘climate change envoy’, has spent 157 days on foreign jaunts at a cost of more than £100,000.

Most of it was bankrolled by Globe International, a climate change organisation.

In a severe dressing-down, Ms Winterton told Mr Gardiner he was banned from going on more junkets.

He subsequently pulled out of a two-day Globe-funded trip to Washington DC scheduled for Thursday and Friday.

But he is said to have dug in his heels over his plan to return to Mexico for a meeting between June 6 and 8, with the estimated £1,500 cost met once again by Globe.

The visit will take to 101 his total number of days of Globe-sponsored foreign travel, at a cost approaching £60,000.

After The Mail on Sunday revealed the MP’s trip to the  Mayan Riviera last week, Mr Gardiner said he had made an ‘error of judgment’ and apologised for ‘any hurt’ his actions caused to victims of the floods.

He said: ‘I honoured a commitment to speak to a pharmacy industry conference about waste. After three days attending the conference I remained on holiday for two further days with my wife before flying back to the UK.

‘At a time when parts of the UK were still recovering from the floods, I am conscious in retrospect that it would have been  better to have cancelled my participation in the conference, and I regret any hurt this has caused to those still coping with the aftermath of flood damage to their homes and property.’

Mr Gardiner refused to comment yesterday.
