It has become a craze with humans, and even pets have been getting in on the act.

And now, it seems, even wild fish have been infected with photobombing, judging from these pictures of Gavin, who has become the main attraction for divers near Green Island, off Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

The bright yellow and blue parrotfish loves nothing better than getting his toothy grin in people's pictures as tourists pose with him in his underwater world.

Photobombing is genuinely considered to ruin people's pictures but, as these snaps reveal, tourists are delighted when he becomes part of their holiday memories.

Karl Kuhle, general manager for Seawalker Australia, said grinning Gavin had become something of a celebrity.

He said: 'Gavin's been around for a couple of years now, and he looks forward to coming over and grinning his lovely little head off at all our guests.

'He does seem to actually swim up for his photo, and with a free feed on offer and gorgeous females for company, who wouldn't be smiling?

'Seriously though, in some photos he seems to have less of a grin than others, but I reckon he's still having a ball.'

Centre of attention: Gavin loves stealing the limelight but is equally happy playing with his mates once the tours have packed up for the day

Karl said the diving tours operate within the guidelines of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure conservation.

Bluebarred parrotfish like Gavin grow up to 1m-long and to 6.5kg in weight. Their teeth in both jaws are fused into a parrot-like peak.

Adults normally swim alone and feed by scraping algae from the reef and coral.

Gavin and his species are vital to the reef-building process because they crush rubble and dead coral into sand as they feed.

He said: 'We feed less than 1kg of approved fish food per day to the hundreds of fish that like Gavin, enjoy meeting Seawalker guests.

'Our staff do the feeding, not the guests, but they get to enjoy watching him come up and grin into their faces as he swipes a little feed.

'I would realistically expect that from a conservation viewpoint there is little difference , regulations help ensure this, by our presence in the water.

'We operate for less than six hours a day, so Gav and his mates are off elsewhere or just hanging around for the other 18 or so hours.'
