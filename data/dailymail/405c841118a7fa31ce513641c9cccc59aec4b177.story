President Obama has canceled his Moscow summit with President Vladimir Putin, making his anger at the Russian leader clear amid heightened tensions over their decision to allow whistle-blower Edward Snowden remain in their country.

The decision, announced on Wednesday, reflects both U.S. anger over their the Snowden decision and growing frustration within the Obama administration over what it sees as Moscow's stubbornness on other key issues, including missile defense and human rights.

The night before the meeting was cancelled, President Obama also talked about how the Russian stance against homosexuals - which will likely become a major issue when they host the winter Olympic games - is another addition to the growing list of concerns.

Tense: Presidents Obama and Putin have always had a frosty relationship (as seen here at a conference in Northern Ireland in June) but now his decision to cancel on the Russian leader is a major sign of trouble

‘Given our lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control, trade and commercial relations, global security issues, and human rights and civil society in the last twelve months, we have informed the Russian Government that we believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared agenda,’ the president said through a press statement released Wednesday.

Issue: Russia's decision to grant Edward Snowden (center) temporary asylum was part of the reason for the cancellation

‘Russia’s disappointing decision to grant Edward Snowden temporary asylum was also a factor that we considered in assessing the current state of our bilateral relationship.’

The president's announcement drew 
scorn from some Republicans - not for the decision itself, but for what GOP 
insiders said it reflected about the White House's ability to control 
U.S.-Russian relations.

'It is Presidential amateur hour,' 
Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley wrote on Twitter shortly after the
announcement, because 'Obama doesn't counter Putin granting asylum to 
Snowden.'

'The Obama "reset" w Russia needs a reset,' he said.

Rep. John Fleming, a Republican from Louisiana, said Obama is 'figuring out now that appeasement toward potential adversaries doesn't work.'

But New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte acknowledged that Obama 'made [the] right call in canceling' the bilateral summit with Putin. She cited 'Russia's actions on [Edwards] Snowden, Syria and human rights issues.'

Obama will still attend the Group of 20 economic summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, but a top White House official said the president had no plans to hold one-on-one talks with Putin while there. Instead of visiting Putin in Moscow, the president will add a stop in Sweden to his early September travel itinerary.

Obama, who is traveling in California, said that the frosty relationship between the U.S. and Russia has come as a result of their actions,  or lack thereof.

'There have been times where they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality,' Obama said in an interview with Jay Leno on The Tonight Show.

‘I was disappointed because even though we don’t have an extradition treaty with them, traditionally we have tried to respect if there’s a law-breaker or an alleged law-breaker in their country, we evaluate it and we try to work with them. They didn’t do that with us. And in some ways it’s reflective of some underlying challenges that we’ve had with Russia lately.

Making a statement: President Obama said that he was 'disappointed' with Russia and their decisions on a host of issues

‘A lot of what’s been going on hasn’t been major breaks in the relationship, and they still help us on supplying our troops in Afghanistan; they’re still helping us on counterterrorism work; they were helpful after the Boston bombing in that investigation.  And so there’s still a lot of business that we can do with them.’

Obama's decision to scrap talks with Putin is also likely to deepen the chill in the already cold relationship between the two leaders.

They have frequently found themselves at odds on pressing international issues, most recently in Syria, where the U.S. accuses Putin of helping President Bashar al-Assad fund a civil war.

The U.S. has also been a vocal critic of Russia's crackdown on Kremlin critics and recently sanctioned 18 Russians for human rights violations.

Moscow has accused the U.S. of installing a missile shield in Eastern Europe as a deterrent against Russia, despite American assurances that the shield is not aimed at its former Cold War foe.

Putin also signed a law last year banning U.S. adoptions of Russian children, a move that was seen as retaliation for the U.S. measure that cleared the way for the human rights sanctions.

Obama and Putin last met in June on the sidelines of the Group of 8 summit in Northern Ireland.

Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that 'Putin doesn't deserve the respect after what he's done with Snowden.'

'I know what he's doing. He's trying to make Russia a big power again,' Schumer said on CNN.

'To show him the respect at the bilateral talks doesn't make sense.'
