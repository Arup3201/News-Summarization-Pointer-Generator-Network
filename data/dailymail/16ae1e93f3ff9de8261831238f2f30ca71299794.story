Tennis star Venus Williams has stripped down to pose naked for a magazine photo shoot.

The five-time Wimbledon champion also revealed intimate details about her struggles with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that causes white blood cells to attack a person's moisture-producing glands.

'At my worst point, I wasn't able to play tennis at all,' the 34-year-old Florida native told ESPN Magazine.

Stripped down: The tennis star posed naked for ESPN Magazine's Body Issue, and also revealed new details about her health strugglesÂ 

'Just the whole quality of my life was compromised. You are so tired it hurts. You have to accept that you're never going to be 100 percent.'

Ms Williams is featured in the magazine's Body Issue along with 2013 Wimbledon quarter-finalist Tomas Berdych, who posed wearing only a racquet and a smile.

In 2012, Ms Williams and her sister Serena made history when they became the first tennis players to claim four Olympic gold medals.

The dynamic duo triumphed in women's doubles against Czech fourth seeds Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka.

But she was forced to stop playing for more than six months in 2011-12 because of her illness - and fought hard to work her way back up the rankings.

Currently, she is ranked 31st in singles play and 88th in doubles.

She explained that the key to her rehabilitation has been learning to pace herself, admitting that there were days when she would fall asleep in her car after training too hard.

Ms Williams is currently in London for Wimbledon, where she faces off today against Maria Teresa Torro-Flor.
