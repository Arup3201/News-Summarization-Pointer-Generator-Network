Each September, the Park at the Legoland Windsor Resort closes down for two days for their post-summer season spruce up.

To prepare for the Brick or Treat Halloween extravaganza, the Model Making and Landscaping team rolled up their sleeves and got to work.

Using suitably mini cleaning tools, they tackled the dust and grime on hundreds of intricate models of some of the world's most iconic landscapes.

Model maker, Marco Mirano, jumped into Miniland's 3ft deep Rive Thames to clean the incredibly intricate Tower Bridge recreation, comprised of over 135,000 bricks.

Meanwhile, model maker Katrina James used a tiny 3cm feature duster to dust off Downing Street, while fellow model maker Paula Laughton used a toothbrush to give Big Ben's famous clock face a once over.

Legoland's landscape gardener opted for garden shears to trim the Buckingham Palace lawn and a leaf blower to blast away the autumnal leaves from a miniature Edinburgh Castle.

The intricate scale model of the Eiffel Tower - which stands 4m tall - required staff to use a cherry picker to get to the top. 

Legoland's Windsor Resort re-opens on 25 September for their Brick and Treat Halloween exhibition. 

The Resort's world famous Miniland will also host the Lego Legends of Chima Fire and Ice Fireworks throughout October and November.
