The Spanish matador who lost his left eye in a horrific goring made a remarkable return to the ring yesterday.

Juan José Padilla, dubbed The Pirate because of the eye-patch he now wears, was given one of the highest accolades when his fellow bullfighters carried him out from the arena following the fight.

Despite not having two-eyed stereoscopic vision to judge distances and the speed of approaching objects accurately, he showed little trouble killing his first bull in front of a crowd of 5,400.

Daring: Despite not having two-eyed stereoscopic vision to judge distances and the speed of approaching objects accurately, he showed little trouble killing his first bull in front of a crowd of 5,400

He then dedicated the second 1,100lb beast to his tearful father, fulfilling what he described as an 'unquenchable desire to face a fighting bull with the aid of only a cape and a sword'.

He said: 'This is like a dream come true after so many months. I am fully aware that nobody thought I would be back.

'But I am not a hero, just someone who has been given the chance to stay alive and continue his passion.'

The 38-year-old, known professionally as the Cyclone of Jerez, was the star attraction at the south-western town of Olivenza's annual taurine festival.

He had previously said he was returning to the ring because of a need 'to win, to triumph, to be a better man'.

Yesterday's bullfight was the first time Padilla had professionally fought since October, when he was seen hobbling from a Zaragoza ring covered in blood screaming 'I can't see'.

He was wounded in October after he slipped on the sand, a bull's horn pierced his jaw and it came out through his eye.

The crowds at the Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar bullfight at the Misericordia ring were left stunned.

He
 then underwent a life-saving five-hour operation to repair severe 
damage to his eye, bone, muscle and skin - his face reconstructed with 
titanium plates and mesh.

It was not the first time Padilla, a 
popular matador who has won many fans for his courage and willingness to
 face the toughest bulls, had been gored.

In 2001 the Jerez native suffered serious injuries to his neck during a fight in Pamplona.

His
 return to the ring came as the intense debate over bullfighting in 
Spain continues - with supporters saying it is a key part of its culture
 and critics claiming it is animal cruelty.

The
 'spectacle' has come under pressure since the 2007 start of the 
economic crisis, as public funds to promote fights are cut, and the 
region of Catalonia banned it in 2011.

But
 Spain's new conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is an avid fan 
and recently inspired the national television networks to start showing 
fights again.

Coverage had been abandoned in 2006 under the previous Socialist administration.

Gored: The bull's horn pierced Padilla's jaw and emerged through his left eye socket after his fight went horribly wrong in the northeastern city of Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar

Fateful fall: Mr Padilla slips as he turns around from the ball and falls to the floor, giving the bull the chance to strike

Pierced: The bull takes its revenge on Mr Padilla by goring him through his jaw as he lies helplessly on the ground

After: With blood gushing from his face, and his assistants distracting the bull, Mr Padilla is helped from the ring
