The bodies of her three victims were found in fields near to Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in March and April last
 year.

Despite killing the three, Dennehy 
remained unsatisfied and fled to Hereford in search of more victims, a 
jury heard.

She cruised the city and selected two other men at random, stabbing Robin Bereza, 64, and John 
Rogers, 56, who survived the cold-blooded attacks.

Alleged conspirators Gary 'Stretch' Richards, 47, and Leslie Layton, 37, who are now on trial at Cambridge Crown Court, deny helping to cover up the 'terrible truth' of the murders.

Pictures of Dennehy and Richards were shown to the court as Mark Lloyd, an associate of the man, gave evidence. Georgina Page, a friend of Dennehy’s, also gave evidence today.

The shocking images include one of Dennehy jovially sticking her tongue out as she brandishes a jagged knife with handcuffs attached to her trousers.

In another the killer is pictured revealing her underwear and standing in a provocative sexual position in the days after committing her crimes. It shows a series of horrendous scars caused by the mother’s relentless self-harming.

In the very next picture, Richards is seen glaring at the camera while pulling his jumper up and standing in another sexual pose.

And in another two pictures the defendant and Mr Lloyd are seen sticking their middle fingers up.

A final image shows the pair casually leaning on a fence just minutes before Dennehy tried to stab another two men to death.

Dennehy,
 of Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, pleaded guilty to the 
three murders and two attempted murders at the Old Bailey in November. 
She also admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of all three 
victims and is in custody awaiting sentencing.

Her victims were her lover Kevin Lee, 48, his friend Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, and housemate John Chapman, 56.

Richards of Orton Goldhay, 
Peterborough, denies three counts of preventing the lawful and decent 
burial of a body and two counts of attempted murder.

Leslie
 Layton, 37, of Orton Goldhay, denies two counts of preventing the 
lawful and decent burial of a body and one count of perverting the 
course of justice.

A third man Robert Moore, 56, of Peterborough, has admitted assisting an offender and is awaiting sentence.

As the pictures were showed to the jury today, Mr Lloyd revealed he had been forced to watch on helplessly as Dennehy tried to kill two strangers in Hereford.

Mr Lloyd, who met Dennehy at a friend’s flat in Kington, Herefordshire, on April 1, shortly before the attempted murders, told the court she stank of blood.

He said she told him: ‘I’ve killed three people, Gary helped dispose of them and I want to do some more. I want some fun.’

Richards swears at the camera and sticks his tongue out

Mr Lloyd said Dennehy became flirtatious with him before asking him to come in the car when she carried out the attacks.

He said: ‘She was caressing my backside and running her hand down my neck. It was like being touched by a rattlesnake.’

Mr Lloyd said he watched helplessly as Dennehy was driven around Hereford looking for people to kill.

He
 described the two attacks on random dogwalkers as like a scene from the
 film Psycho: ‘It was frenzied. She just went absolutely mad.

'She takes a knife out of her
 left pocket with her right hand. She strikes him like in the film 
Psycho, just like that. Thrusting and putting her whole weight behind 
it.

'I just kept saying "what the f*ck is going on, I haven’t signed up for this."

'Gary is seeing exactly what I’m seeing and there’s just no emotion from him at all.'

Mr Lloyd said Dennehy returned to the car and kissed Stretch on the cheek 'as if to say thanks'.

He said the second attack was a 'brutal re-run' of the stabbing just moments earlier.

John Chapman was also stabbed to death by the 31-year-old

After the second knife attack Mr Lloyd said Dennehy returned with the victim’s dog in her arms and declared it was her new pet.

Mr Lloyd said: 'It was terrified of her. It was physically shaking on her lap. She wanted to take the dog for a walk.'

He
 added that Dennehy treated 7ft 3in Stretch 'like a puppy' and said the 
giant would be dead if the killer hadn’t needed him to drive her around.

Georgina Page then told the court how she and Dennehy became friends while serving jail sentences together.

She said she next saw her former cell mate when she and Stretch turned up on her doorstep in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, following the murders.

She said: 'When I was inside with her she wasn’t a murderer or nothing. At first I didn’t believe her.

'I was very shocked. I was scared, I didn’t know what to do.'

The court also heard that during the pair’s stay at Ms Page’s house Dennehy was 'jumping around' in delight at seeing her face on the news.

Ms Page said the killer downed whisky and ate a ham sandwich while bragging about her violent acts.

She said: 'I was terrified. Stretch turned round and said that if anyone grassed on them he would get his dad to sort them out.

'Joanna was talking about something and saying "you know we’re going to get caught and sent to jail for a long time".'

She also said Dennehy compared herself and Stretch to 'Bonnie and Clyde' whose gang killed nine policeman in 1930s America.

Killer: Joanna Dennehy stabbed three men in a 10-day spree of violence

And
 when she asked her why she had killed, Dennehy responded: 'They 
shouldn’t have pissed me off, they shouldn’t have flirted with me'

A picture of the knife believed to be used in all five attacks was also shown to court and described as a nine-inch fold knife.

Mr Lloyd said he saw the same knife in Dennehy’s hands at a flat in Hereford occupied by his friend Moby.

It was there that Dennehy took pictures of herself and Stretch as they prepared to drive round the city in a bid to kill again.

Mr Lloyd told the jury that the blade 'was as black as the handle' because of all the congealed blood and that it 'smelt like copper'.

He said Dennehy than told him: 'I’ve killed three people, Gary’s helped dispose of them and I want to do some more. You’ve had your fun Gary, I want my fun.'

Mr Lloyd also revealed that Dennehy flirted with him and 'caressed' his neck and backside.

He told the court she said: 'I wish I could have met you last year, your my type of guy'

He said that Stretch 'was not liking it one bit' before the three of them got into the green Vauxhall Astra that the killer had travelled in from Peterborough.

Mr Lloyd then said he tried to call the police while Stretch drove around Hereford looking for victims for Dennehy.

But he failed to do so and told a court that 'Gary was the taxi driver, she went around killing people'.

The trial continues.
