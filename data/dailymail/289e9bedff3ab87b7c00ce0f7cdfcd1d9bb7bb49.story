Shocking tornado footage shows how a Nebraska home was lifted completely off its foundations, spun in the air and then placed right back where it came from.

Only the Pilger home was facing the wrong direction as a terrified father and his two young children survived the ordeal just inches below in the basement.

It may be the most bizarre and fascinating tale to emerge from the horrific afternoon on June 16 when twin twisters all but destroyed the prairie town of 350 people and took the lives of two.

Nature's fury: Many experts believe this shocking footage shows a home being picked up and spun in the air be one of the twin twisters that ravaged the town of Pilger, Nebraska on June 16

Unbelievable: The home landed back on its original foundations, but it was turned 180 degrees. A father and his two young children managed to survive in its basement

Relief: Corey Savage (pictured kissing his wife Julia) thought all was lost in the moments after the twister blew through his home. The father was with his 4-year-old daughter and toddler son at the time

Experts agree, the structure seen being sucked into the sky in footage taken by storm chaser Dick McGowan and first published on TVNWeather.com could well be a home.

'There’s so many surprising things that have been documented in tornadoes,' Accuweather meteorologist Jack Boston told Omaha.com. 'Driving straw into a wall, sucking all the water out of a swimming pool. So who can say?'

The occupants of the Pilger home may be able to attest that the house was indeed turned 180 degrees during the twister, but they were busy taking cover in the basement and praying for their lives to say for sure how it got that way.

Corey Savage thought all was lost in the moments after the twister blew through his home.

The father was with his 4-year-old daughter and toddler son when he ran for safety with just a blanket to protect them.

But the powerful storm sucked away the blanket and when it passed, Savage didn't know if his kids had survived.

He found 
his son nearby with a concrete block in his lap. Savage lifted the the 
debris away and the boy was miraculously uninjured.

He dug his daughter's limp form out from beneath a water heater and door that weren't even from his home.

Not a total loss: The home was a total loss, as was about 80 percent of the town of 350, but all the young Savage family managed to survive

Overcome: Juliana Savage was overcome with emotion as she discussed her family's brush with death

Miraculous: Pictures of the Pilger home before it was bulldozed show just how close to death the Savages came. Note the precarious positioning of the home atop the basement where Corey Savage and children hid

'Then she stood up,' 25-year-old Savage told Omaha.com. 'She cried, and I cried. I was so happy. I thought she was going to be paralyzed.'

They fled the basement as sewage and gas poured in.

'The entire house collapsed down on top of them,' Juliana Savage, who was not with her husband and children during the storm, told Samaritan's Purse. 'I don't know how they made it out alive.'

While the Savages' world has been turned upside down, their house appears to only have been turned 180 degrees, though it has--along with about 80 percent of the town of Pilger--now been totally raised.

Dual destruction: Twisters approach Pilger on June 16, 2014.  The National Weather Service said at least two twisters touched down within roughly a mile of each other in northeaster Nebraska before barreling toward the town of 350

Corey Savage told Omaha.com he's been too busy picking up the pieces to watch the startling video that many say depicts the very moment his home became a UFO.

Photographer Krista Giese, who took pictures of the Savages' home following the tornado, neatly sums up what will likely forever remain a mystery in Pilger.

'It’s one of those things I don’t think we’ll ever know the answer to, no matter how much video we watch,' she said. 'It’s an amazing possibility.'
