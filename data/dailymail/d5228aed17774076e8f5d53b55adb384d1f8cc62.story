The Los Angeles rapper who sliced off his own genitalia before jumping out of a window has broken his silence about the ugly incident last month, saying depression drove him to do it.

Andre Johnson - who performs under the stage name Christ Bearer with the Wu-Tang affiliated group Northstar - was reported to have been high on dangerous psychedelic PCP when he cut off his penis and leaped from a two-storey baclony in North Hollywood.

But the 40-year-old, also known as C.B., has now told TMZ that he was smoking weed and reading a book about monks and vasectomies right before the self-castration.

He said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third child on the way.

Self-castrated: Andre Johnson - who goes by his rap name Christ Bearer or C.B. - said he chopped off his own penis because he was depressed about not being able to see his two daughters. He was reported to be under the influence of the psychedelic PCP, which is known for its dissociative effects

TMZ also reported that Johnson's member was able to be reattached by doctors.

While he claims he will be able to regain full functionality, having more children will likely not be possible.

The incident occurred at an apartment compex about 1am on Wednesday April 16.

Police classified the case as an attempted suicide.

Friends within the building said Johnson managed the mutilation quickly before running and jumping over the ledge.

However E! Online reported that the rapper cut off the tip of his penis first, then removed his testicles and the remainder of his genitalia.

E! also said Johnson was under the influence of PCP at the time, which also goes by names Phencyclidine or Angel Dust.

When people from the building ran downstairs to see if Johnson had survived the fall, they said he was already on his feet screaming.

He was found in critical condition before he was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

The organs were recovered upstairs.

Neighbors initially said Johnson did not seem to be under the effect of hard drugs.

It was also reported that doctors were unable to reattach his penis.

Northstar is described on the Wu-Tang website as a duo from the north side of Long Beach who have produced songs warning of the dangers of drugs and saluting their own Muslim beliefs.

In 1998, they were discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA, who produced some of their albums.

As Johnson's unfortunate incident hit headlines, RAZA moved to distance himself for the rap duo, releasing a statement he has had nothing to do with them for 10 years.

PCP is a 'dissociative drug' meaning that it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. 

First introduced as a street drug in the 1960s, PCP - which comes in crystal form but is often smoked with a herb like mint or marijuana -  quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. 

However, some abusers continue to use PCP due to the feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind that PCP can induce.
