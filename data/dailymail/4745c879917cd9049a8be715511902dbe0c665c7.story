Ronnie O'Sullivan showed his annoyance at a photographer capturing the action as he was bundled out of the Wales open in the third round by Matthew Stevens.

The defending champion had already stated his disapproval at the change of venue for the tournament, from the Newport Centre to Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena, saying it was 'like playing in a shopping mall', and his frustration boiled over again on Wednesday.

O'Sullivan cast a photographer a glare after knocking the brown ball almost the length of the table and into the corner pocket.

A stern stare and an open-handed wave indicating 'no more' in the direction the ball had travelled was followed by more shakes of the head and more imposing looks from the five-time world champion. 

The incident didn't impact O'Sullivan's game in the immediate aftermath, after he added to his first frame victory to take a 2-0 lead. 

But Stevens managed to come from behind twice to defeat 'The Rocket' for the first time in 12 years.

O'Sullivan took an early 2-0 lead before the 37-year-old nicknamed The Welsh Dragon took a tight third frame and then delivered an 80 break  to square up the match.

After O'Sullivan regained the lead with a 57-point clearance, Stevens came over the top of the current world No 2 and showed great composure to clinch the deciding frame for a 4-3 victory.
