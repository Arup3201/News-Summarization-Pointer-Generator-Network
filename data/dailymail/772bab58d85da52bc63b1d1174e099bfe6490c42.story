A Christmas sunshine holiday in the Canary Islands ended in tragedy for a British family when a one-year-old baby choked to death.

Little Alfie Brown choked at the hotel where he was staying with his mother and grandparents in Playa de las Americas.

He had been taken by his mother, Stephanie Balentine, 19, of Halesowen, West Midlands, to see a Spanish doctor after he became ill.

He appeared to respond to treatment but was found dead in bed the next day, December 28, after returning to the hotel.

Before he died, Stephanie posted a picture of her son dressed as an elf, with the message: 'Santa's Little Helper, love him so much'.

Yesterday a family member who answered the door at the grandparents end terrace house in Halesowen, said: 'We are too upset to talk. Everybody is absolutely shattered.'

An elderly woman looking after Stephanie's semi-detached family home nearby added: 'I am just looking after the home while they are away - I don't want to get involved in it. It is a family matter and an absolute tragedy.'

One neighbour, Bill Wicks, 50, said: 'They are a very close family and there's been an endless stream of well-wishers going around to over their condolences.

'Everybody in the street is deeply saddened. You wouldn't wish this on anybody - its absolutely heart-breaking.'

Lynsey Evetts posted on Facebook: 'My thoughts are with you and your family.'

Alfie's grandmother Jane Brown posted: 'As you can imagine, we're all devastated and it's really hard to talk about.'

His father had remained in Britain over the Christmas period and later travelled to Tenerife.

Little Alfie was taken to hospital in Playa de las Americas the day before he died. He was discharged after responding well to treatment
