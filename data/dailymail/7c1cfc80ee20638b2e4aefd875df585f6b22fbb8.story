A Sydney childcare worker felt 'contentment' when he reached up the skirt of a young girl and carried out actions that would destroy her life, a court has heard.

Nikki Stoupe says that initial feeling was replaced by feelings of shame, shock and disgust when he realised what he had done to the young girl at an after-school care centre in Sydney's north-west.

Stoupe has pleaded guilty to the aggravated indecent assault of the girl in 2012.

He has also pleaded guilty to filming the girl on his mobile phone over a toilet door.

The 29-year-old, who was employed by The Cubby House for six years, told the Parramatta District Court he developed inappropriate feelings for the victim in 2012.

He said the victim, now 10, sometimes called him 'Daddy', which he grew to enjoy.

In April 2012, he said he went to check on the victim - who was in the bathroom - and took out his mobile phone, put it over the door and started filming.

He later accessed the footage once or twice.

Three months later he picked up the victim and placed her on his knee as he sat behind his supervisor's desk.

Stoupe said he put his hand up her skirt and touched her.

'At the time it was a sense of contentment ... it's a horrible thing to say,' he told a sentencing hearing.

'But I've since learned that was part of my mental state.' 

Despite feeling ashamed, he put the victim on his knee and assaulted her again in September 2012.

A parent walked in on him and raised concerns with management which gave him a formal warning.

The 29-year-old also filmed the girl while she was in the bathroom at The Cubby House in Sydney's north-west

Two weeks later, Stoupe assaulted her again in a storage room.

Less than a week later, he was fired.

Stoupe, who has obesity, said he was suicidal after the ordeal but has since accepted what he did.

He was supported by his mother and siblings in court on Tuesday.

'I have destroyed her life,' he said.

'I have destroyed her family's life. I will never understand the sheer amount of damage I've done.'

Asked about a report deeming he had a low-medium risk of re-offending, Stoupe said it would be inappropriate to say there would be no risk of re-offending.

The hearing continues.
