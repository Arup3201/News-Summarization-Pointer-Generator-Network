A father broke his leg in six places as he was catapulted out of a waterslide into the  wall of a swimming pool at a Turkish resort.

Des Jarvis, 46, needed five major operations to save his leg, and doctors say he will never work again.

Surgeons had to break the limb in another three places before fitting 18 metal pins and rods.

Bone-crunching: Des Jarvis (circled) broke his right leg in six places when he skidded off the end of this waterslide with a dangerously short plunge pool in a Turkish holiday resort

Impact: Mr Jarvis was on holiday when he went down the chute and was hurled into the wall of this plunge pool

Injured: After the accident, which was captured on camera, medics were forced to operate to save his leg after Mr Jarvis contracted a potentially fatal bone infection

Injury: Mr Jarvis needed five major operations to save his limb from a bone infection, and doctors were then forced to break his leg in another three places before fitting eighteen metal pins and rods

They removed part of his right tibia, leaving him with a limp as one leg is two inches shorter than the other.

Now, there are claims that the slide is too high and steep for the pool, and there is not enough space for an adult to slow down fully after being shot out of the end of the chute.

Unbelievably, the slide is still thought to be in use, and five other tourists are now believed to have  been injured.

Yesterday, former window fitter Mr Jarvis said: ‘I have no life any more, I can’t go out, get dressed, socialise, nothing.

And to add insult to injury, I have been told that I will never be able to go back and do the job I love. It’s all I have known for 24 years and now it’s over.’

Mr Jarvis was on a £5,500 holiday with girlfriend Nikki, 42, and their four children when he suffered the horrific accident at Didim Beach Resort in Altinkum, Turkey, in  summer 2012.

Trip of a lifetime: Mr Jarvis had splashed out £5,500 to take girlfriend Nikki, 42, and their four children to Turkey

As a result of the crash, which was captured on camera, he contracted a potentially fatal bone infection. Only five painful operations saved him from an amputation.

Two years on, he is in constant pain – and could still lose his limb. Last October, he had a metal cage fitted around the open wound, which limits his mobility even further.

Mr Jarvis said: ‘I have lost two inches of my height off my right leg as they had to cut all the infected bone away. And now my leg is in three pieces. 

‘My life is a constant battle. My girlfriend has to work as my virtual carer, administering antibiotics and washing me. I can’t go and play football with my son, take [my children] on days out, or go to parents’ evenings.

‘I have to live in my pyjamas every minute of every day because I can’t put any trousers over the cage.’

Mr Jarvis, from Peterborough, said he still has not received compensation from holiday firm First Choice. 

He said: ‘The holiday company have robbed me of my kids’ childhoods.

‘First Choice have washed their hands of me. I can’t sleep, go out or do anything, and I am in constant pain. But all they want to do is sweep it under the carpet.

'I don’t want anyone else to go through this hell.’

A new video has recently emerged of another tourist having a near miss on the same slide.

Mr Jarvis’s solicitor Nick Harris said: ‘It’s bordering on madness that despite Des’s accident the slide remains in use. It’s almost as though someone must be killed before anything will be done.’

The case is being featured on BBC1’s show Holiday Hit Squad tonight, with experts claiming it flouts local safety standards.

A spokesman for First Choice said it could not comment for legal reasons, adding: ‘We are sorry to hear about the injuries sustained by Mr Jarvis.

'Incidents of this type are very rare, the health and safety of our customers is of paramount importance to First Choice.’
