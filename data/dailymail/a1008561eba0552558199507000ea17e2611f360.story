The owners of a rescue cat who was born without a nose bone are hoping that their pet will serve as proof to the world that appearances aren’t everything. 

Monty, who was rescued from a Copenhagen, Denmark, shelter a year ago , was born without a nasal bridge, or a nose bone. But while the 'chromosomal abnormality' causes him to sneeze a lot, he is still healthy and can breathe normally.

'We wish for Monty to be an ambassador for "crooked" cat or cats that may not look perfect in everyone's eyes!' said his owners in a recent Facebook post. 'We also want to raise attention to the fact that looking different doesn't mean you can't be fantastic.'

So much love! Monty's owners say they want their little boy to be living proof that you can still look different and be fantastic 

Monty, who is approximately four years old, loves to be carried around and sleep in laps, according to his owners, who say that they knew he was special the moment they spotted him.

'The first time we met Monty, there were no doubt in our minds that he was to come live with us,' they said. 'His special appearance makes him look so incredibly cute, but his personality is rare as a diamond!' 

During his time at the shelter, Monty shared a room with a group of unruly cats, but he stayed calm and quiet even when they were aggressive toward him. His friendly and gentle nature struck a chord with his owners, who knew that he would fit in nicely in their home, where they already had two cats, Mikkel 'the three-legged cat' and Malle 'the gentle giant'.

'When it comes to love, nothing reaches the love he's got for Malle and Mikkel,' they said. 'A great match indeed!'

Monty already has nearly 50,000 fans on Facebook - and is quickly getting lots more. He can also be found on Instagram at monty_happiness. 

His little face is so popular, in fact, that his owners have started selling Monty merchandise. At Rageon.com, you can get a Monty sweatshirt that says 'I'm not perfect but PAWsome!' or a sweatshirt or T-shirt that say 'Purrfect!'. All the items have a huge  version of Monty's face as the focal point.

The T-shirts cost $49.84 and the sweatshirts are both $59.84.

Get some sleep! Monty takes a big yawn before inevitably taking another nap

Though Monty's abnormality does make him cute, his owners advise against breeding cats with similar problems just to get a 'different look'.

'No, we think that is an incredibly bad idea!' they said in a Facebook Q&A. 'We want to get the message out that appearance does not matter.

'All animals deserve to be loved and treated with respect.'
