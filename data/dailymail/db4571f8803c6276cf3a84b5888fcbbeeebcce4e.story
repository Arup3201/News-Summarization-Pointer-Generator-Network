A truck fire that 
forced workers to evacuate the southeastern New Mexico site where the 
federal government seals away its low-grade nuclear waste, including 
plutonium-contaminated clothing and tools, was no longer burning by late
 Wednesday.

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant's 
mine rescue team went into the underground site near Carlsbad and 
confirmed that the fire in a truck hauling salt was out, a news release 
and a spokeswoman answering an emergency line said late Wednesday. The 
team also reported that the air was clear and safe to breathe.

Joint
 Information Center member Susan Scott says a second mine rescue team 
was heading down to survey the extent of the damage. She said there was 
no information on what caused the blaze or when the site would reopen.

All
 employees were evacuated from the underground site after the fire broke
 out about 11 a.m. Wednesday, and none of the radioactive waste was 
affected, plant officials said. Six people were treated for smoke 
inhalation and released a short while later.

At
 an afternoon news conference, officials said the fire occurred on a 
truck in the facility's north mine, the Carlsbad Current-Argus reported.
 Nuclear waste is stored in the south mine, officials said.

Fire
 suppression systems and rescue teams were immediately activated, and 
all waste handling operations were suspended, officials said.

Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., issued a statement characterizing the event as a 'minor fire.'

'It
 is critically important to note that at no point did the fire threaten 
the waste disposed of at the WIPP, nor was the community or public ever 
at risk,' he said.

The Waste Isolation Pilot 
Plant is the nation's first and only deep geological nuclear repository.
 It takes plutonium-contaminated waste from Los Alamos National 
Laboratory and defense projects, and buries it in rooms cut from 
underground salt beds.

Nevada's Yucca Mountain
 is another underground site built as a potential repository for used 
nuclear fuel, but it is not operational, said Rod McCullum, the director
 of used-fuels programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute.

The
 New Mexico facility receives 17 to 19 shipments each week from sites 
around the country, including Los Alamos and installations in Idaho, 
Illinois and South Carolina.

The repository is licensed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency every five years, McCullum said.

The staff was evacuated and no radioactive material was affected
