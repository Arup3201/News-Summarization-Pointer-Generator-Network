An Upstate New York mom diagnosed with a rare pregnancy-related 
cancer following the premature birth of her twins daughters died Monday.

'Jenna fought this disease with everything she had and we are so proud 
of her amazing courage and for blessing the world with two precious 
little angels,' read a note from friends who operated a 'Prayers for Jenna' Facebook page.

'Until we meet again, we love you, gorgeous girl.'

Jenna Hinman, 26, from upstate N.Y., passed away Monday two months after the premature birth of her twin daughters revealed she had a rare pregnancy-related cancer

Emergency: After Jenna struggled to breathe, doctors delivered her daughters, pictured, by emergency C-section. They were nine weeks early and weighed just 3 pounds each

Two months ago, Jenna
 Hinman, 26, was rushed to hospital on when all of a sudden she 
couldn't breathe and her husband, US Army Sgt. Brandon Hinman, called 
911.

Doctors
 quickly decided she needed an emergency C-section to deliver the girls,
 Kinleigh and Azlynn, who were nine weeks early and weighed just 3 
pounds each.

Because of their health, Jenna was 
able to get just a quick glimpse of her newborns before they were 
whisked away to NICU at Crouse Hospital in Syracuse where they'd all 
been transferred. But that was the only time she saw them.

Soon after delivery, the young mom began coughing up blood and her breathing troubles got worse.

On March 6, Jenna, pictured left and right, was placed in a medically induced coma and Brandon, who is based at Fort Drum, spent the remaining months of her life at her bedside

A GoFundMe to help cover the family's enormous medical expenses has raised more than $169,000 so far

Doctors
 initially thought she had pneumonia, but she was later diagnosed with a
 rare cancer called choriocarcinoma, which has filled her body with 
tumors and lesions.

On
 March 6, she was placed in a medically induced coma and Brandon, who is
 based at Fort Drum, is supporting her tirelessly as a team of local and
 international doctors try to save her life.

Her Facebook, which has attracted more than 266,000 'likes,' was covered in condolences as news of her death spread, the Daily News reported.

'Our prayers continue for Brandon and the twins,' one user wrote. 'RIP Jenna, you fought the fight and now it is time to rest.'

A GoFundMe page established to help the family cover medical expenses has raised more than $169,000.

'Her lungs are so involved with tumor that they don't work. And right now they're not working at all,' Crouse Hospital oncologist Dr. Wiley Bunn told cnycentral.com as she struggled for life.

She is received heavy doses of chemotherapy and an ECMO machine, which costs around $100,000 a day to run, was removing blood from her body, oxygenating it and pumping it back through her veins.

Jenna left behind two beautiful daughters who've thrived after their premature birth

'Jenna fought this disease with everything she had and we are so proud of her amazing courage and for blessing the world with two precious little angels,' read a note from friends who operated a 'Prayers for Jenna' Facebook page.

The cancer forms in the placenta but spreads quickly. It is seen in fewer than one in 160,000 cases, Bunn said.

Jenna's condition was touch and go from the start but she was able to speak to Brandon briefly during a moment of conciousness.

'I walked up to her bed and grabbed her hand and said 'honey it's me. I love you, you're doing great.' And as I was talking she shook her head yes,' Brandon told cnycentral two months before her passing..

'That could be the last time I talk to my wife,' he said at the time.
