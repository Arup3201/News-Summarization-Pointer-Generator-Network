A graduate ended up with a 'cat' drawn on her photo cake instead of a 'cap' after an amusing mix-up at a bakery.

When Laura Gambrel, 22, of Zionsville, Ind., graduated from Indiana University in May, her mother ordered a picture of her face, a scroll and the school's colours - red and white

She instructed the local baker to draw a graduation cap on her daughter's head, but the worker must have misheard the request and instead drew on a cat.

Hysterical mistake: A graduate ended up with a 'cat' drawn on her photo cake instead of a 'cap' after an amusing mix-up at a bakery

'I can only image them doing it and thinking I was going to vet school or something,' Laura Gambrel told GoodMorningAmerica.com.

'My mom thought it would be funny to get a
face cake. She got it and she asked them to draw a little cap on. But 
when she went to pick it up later, she saw that there was a cat on it, 
and started laughing hysterically and said, 'No, that's not what I meant
at all.'

The family were so amused by the mix-up that they decided to keep the cake.

Carol Gambrel, 59, admitted that the boy at the baker's shop had given her a 'look' when she ordered the cake, but did not realise he had misheard her.

'It was one of those young kids behind the counter and he
seemed a little distracted with someone else ordering a cake a foot 
away from us. We went through the school colors and everything, and I 
said, 'Oh, could you draw a cap on her head?, she explained.Â 

The story surfaced after a user Bluesberry posted on Reddit: 'My mom ordered a graduation cake with a cap drawn on. I guess they misheard.'

'When my mom got to the store and started laughing they tried to wipe off the cat and put on a plastic cap, but she told them to keep it.'

The results proved to be popular on the website, with more than 29,000 up votes.
