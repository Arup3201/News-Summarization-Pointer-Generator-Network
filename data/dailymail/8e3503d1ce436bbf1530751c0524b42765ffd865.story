Ed Miliband is facing a Labour revolt over secret plans for a ‘nanny state’ crackdown on drinking, smoking and junk food.

Leaked documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday show the Labour leader is proposing sweeping new laws to force people to live healthier lives if he wins next year’s General Election. They include banning cheap beer and wine, flying in the face of Mr Miliband’s campaign to cut the cost of living.

And it will mean tough new curbs on food and drinks firms, television and sport – which would lose £300 million from the outlawing of alcohol sponsorship.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is working on the the plan which will dramatically change society by restricting what can be sold in shops

The Labour leader believes his policies will be a vote-winner in an increasingly health-conscious nation. But they have sparked a backlash from Labour moderates led by Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, tipped as Mr Miliband’s successor.

Supporters of Blairite Mr Umunna say the plans risk being seen as ‘anti business and interventionist’ – and reinforce Mr Miliband’s Left wing ‘Red Ed’ image.

The row follows a similar internal Labour dispute over plans by Mr Miliband to cap energy prices and rents.

‘Issuing diktats on eating and drinking and strangling supermarkets and drinks companies with more regulations is a return to the failed Old Labour approach,’ said one Labour MP. ‘It is no more realistic than thinking you can control people’s gas and electricity bills or how much rent they pay.

‘We need to show business we are on their side – and stop meddling in every aspect of people’s lives.’

The Labour health blueprint includes:

The plans were drawn up by Andy Burnham. Sources close to the health spokesman say Mr Miliband has vowed to make them a key part of Labour’s manifesto.  Meanwhile, Mr Burnham is said to regard it as a vital way of advancing his own Labour leadership ambitions.

The proposals were backed by Mr Miliband at a meeting with senior Shadow Cabinet Ministers, including Ed Balls, Harriet Harman, Douglas Alexander and Tristram Hunt.

They are members of one of three secret policy-making groups set up by Mr Miliband to bypass the Party’s official National Policy Forum, which includes union leaders, activists and MPs.

Details of the legally enforced health shake-up are revealed in a report to the ‘society’ sub group of the Shadow Cabinet. To stop union leaders and activists finding out about the plans, Mr Miliband gave orders that no minutes were kept. But a copy of the proposals obtained by this newspaper show they would lead to one of the most radical attempts in history to use the law to change lifestyles.

Among the most far-reaching aspect of the Labour plans is a legal crusade to cut ‘boozing’.

The Labour document says: ‘Up to  35 per cent of all A&E attendances and ambulance costs may be alcohol related and up to 70 per cent at weekend peak times.’ Sports fans and participants would be the first to feel the effects. It declares: ‘The promotion of alcohol through the sponsorship of sport should be phased out during the course of the [five year] Parliament.’

A ban on all sponsorship by drinks companies would cost the sporting world £300 million a year, of which £50 million goes to grassroots activities. A total of 11 Premiership teams receive money from drinks companies. The Labour plan would also spell the end for Budweiser’s sponsorship of the FA Cup, Heineken’s branding  of the European Cup rugby tournament and Crabbie’s support of the Grand National.

The plan is being opposed moderates in Mr Miliband's shadow cabinet such as Chuka Umunna, who is afraid Red Ed's left-wing image will hurt the party in the election

David Cameron scrapped plans last year for a 40p minimum unit price for alcohol after claims that it would hit the poor hardest. But Mr Miliband will force it through if he becomes Prime Minister.

The leaked Labour paper says ‘minimum unit pricing or an alternative’ is needed ‘to reduce the availability of high alcohol, low price “booze” used for “pre-loading’’’– or drinking cheap store-bought alcohol at home before a night on the town.

Mr Miliband will also decide which shelves are used to display certain products at the supermarket, with discounted alcohol moved to the back of stores.

‘The positioning of alcohol retail space in supermarkets should be regulated, for example, being  limited to a single defined area physically distant from the doors,’  it says.

Town hall and police chiefs would be given new powers to force pubs to pay a levy to cover the cost of policing town centres where there is disorder caused by drunks.

They would also get extra powers to remove licences from landlords accused of running unruly pubs.

Similar sweeping measures, backed by law, are planned to make Britain ‘smoke free’, with a target or reducing the number of adults who smoke to one in ten of the population in  a decade.

Currently about 22 per cent of adult men and 19 per cent of women are smokers.

‘Helping them quit is not only good for their health but their finances too: if they smoke 20 a day quitting puts over £2,000 back in their pockets each year,’ the document states

Mr Miliband’s ‘goal is that children born in 2015 will become the first smoke-free generation for hundreds of years.’

To make Britain ‘smoke free’ he would ban smoking in cars with children and introduce plain standardised cigarette packets. And Mr Miliband would treat the tobacco industry as a pariah, refusing to have any contact with it.

‘Labour should become the country’s first “tobacco-free” political party, rejecting sponsorship or donations from the tobacco industry or their front organisations,’ says the document.

Mr Miliband’s plan to tackle the rise in obesity, in particular among the young, could lead to some well-known products, including breakfast cereals with a high sugar content, being banned, with further  curbs on television adverts.

Labour’s anti-obesity plan states: ‘In England, 62 per cent of adults and 28 per cent of children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese, costing the NHS more than £5 billion a year.’ 

It calls 
for ‘regulations to limit the levels of fat, salt and sugar in products 
marketed substantially to  children. Food marketed to children via 
television should also be curbed by a 9pm watershed [for such  
products].’

And Mr Miliband would stop supermarkets displaying sweets near tills to stop children pestering their parents into buying them.

‘They should not be permitted to stock confectionery and other unhealthy foods adjacent to checkout tills,’ says the document.

And
 Mr Miliband would lead a new drive to force millions of people to get 
off their backsides and get fit, stating ‘lack of physical activity and 
sedentary lifestyles are associated with a wide range of physical and 
mental health conditions’.

However, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham believes the plan should be central to Labour's election manifesto

He wants ‘daily physical activity’ with ‘an ambition to get half the population physically active by 2025.’

The document adds: ‘We are currently looking at the best definition of physically active for this purpose’.

His get fit plan includes a lottery fund to ‘finance the construction of skateboard parks, BMX tracks, netball and basketball courts. All school pupils will be taught to swim and ride a bike safely.’ Labour will aim to ensure all children do a minimum of two hours of PE a week.
