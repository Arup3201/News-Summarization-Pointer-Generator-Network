Paul Scholes believes Diego Costa should be admired for his patience on the football pitch rather than criticised for his tough tackling attitude.

The Spain international is facing an immediate three-match ban for his apparent stamp on the Liverpool's Emre Can during Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge.

Costa was later involved in a second stamping furore involving Liverpool's Slovakian defender Martin Skrtel, but the FA said they would not take any action over that incident.

Despite Costa's fiery temper, Manchester United legend Scholes claims the Blues striker should be shown more respect after 'extreme provocation' from Skrtel.

Writing in his column for the Independent, Scholes said: 'As for Diego Costa, I see it differently to the rest. 

'I thought his actions were at the lower end of the scale of dangerous and that he was under extreme provocation from Martin Skrtel, who has wound him up before this season.

'My view of it was that Costa gets kicked a lot and actually his patience is to be admired in many, if not all, situations.'

Costa is contesting the FA's charge for violent conduct, but will miss crucial Premier League clashes against Manchester City, Aston Villa and Everton should the charge stand.

The disciplinary case is now set to be heard by an independent regulatory commission on Friday, which will make a final ruling over whether Costa must serve the suspension for his charge.
