Cannabis compensation: WPC Karry Ann Taylor successfully sued her own force for £5,000 for cutting her thumb

A policewoman sued her own force for nearly £5,000 after cutting her thumb while cleaning up a cannabis factory.

Kerry Ann Taylor, 34, won £4,837 by successfully arguing
Hampshire Police breached its duty as an employer by exposing her to 
fumes and failing to provide thick gloves.

The WPC injured herself when she  tried to open a window and put her hand through it.

Fumes from cannabis plants in the property had made her feel ill and she wanted to let in some fresh air.

It cost the force £145,000 in legal 
costs to take the case to London’s Court of Appeal this week in a battle
to ­overturn the ruling, the Sunday Mirror reported today.

WPC
Taylor’s lawyer Andrew Roy, urged the court to uphold the 2008 verdict 
because the flat-turned-drug factory in Southsea, Hampshire, was 
'dangerous premises' with a foreseeable risk of injury.

He
told the appeal judges: 'The only protective equipment provided was 
thin latex gloves.

'There was limited ventilation and her case, accepted 
by the judge, was she was suffering the effects of inhaling ­cannabis 
fumes.

'There was cannabis drying out and the place was a nest of wires.'

Geoffrey
Weddell, for the police force, told the judges: 'WPC Taylor had simply 
not been ­allocated any task that required the provision of thick 
gloves.

'It is absurd to suggest the Chief Constable ought to have 
provided such gloves.'

And Lord Justice Elias said: 'She was
pulling out cannabis plants. There were no sharp edges involved at that
time. There is no obligation on the Chief Constable (to provide thick 
gloves) at that point.'

Mr
Roy argued that Hampshire Police’s own guidance at the time said 
officers entering cannabis factories should in fact be ­provided with 
body armour.

Heading force: Hampshire Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh

But Judge Elias said officers 'don’t need body armour' for going in to clean up a cannabis factory.

Judge David Blunt QC made the original ruling against then Chief Constable Alex Marshall at ­Winchester Crown Court in 2008.

The court reserved judgement until a later date in the case of WPC Taylor who is still with Hampshire Police.

A Police Federation spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that the matter is with the Court of Appeal.

'Whilst we await the judgement it would not be appropriate to comment further.'

The appeal came as it was revealed last week that a police officer was paid £10,000 compensation after falling off a chair on London Underground premises.

Details of the award to the British Transport Police officer were released after it emerged Norfolk Police officer Kelly Jones is suing a petrol station owner for £50,000 because she allegedly tripped while responding to a 999 call.
