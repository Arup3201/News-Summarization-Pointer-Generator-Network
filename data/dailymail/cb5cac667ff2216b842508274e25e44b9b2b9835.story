Politicians do it, barristers do it, even comedians do it – but for others, being able to speak fluently on a subject can leave them flustered and tongue-tied.

Now scientists are trying to find out just what it is that allows some of us to speak without hesitation, deviation or repetition.

The study – which is modelled on the long-running Radio 4 series Just a Minute, in which contestants ad lib for 60 seconds – is comparing the brains of comics, barristers and TV personalities with those of ‘normal’ people.

Differences in the scans could reveal why some people are silver-tongued in situations that leave others mumbling. 

Researcher Joe Nercus, of University College London, said: ‘We assume we are all experts in speech but some just seem more natural and fluent than others. 

'How come some are born raconteurs while others struggle?’

During the experiment, volunteers must speak as fluently as they can on ten topics while lying in an MRI scanner. 

Unlike on Just a Minute, they only have 30 seconds to fill – as a minute was deemed too tricky – but they do have to lie perfectly still and put up with the noise of the machine.

A second activity – counting out loud – shows how the brain reacts during a task that does not involve improvisation.

While this may seem simple, some of the comedians actually found it harder than talking about a topic. 

The study might show that those with the gift of the gab use the same part of the brain as everyone else, but just put it to better use. Or there may be structural differences in the brain.

Two Just a Minute contestants, comedians Richard Herring and Robin Ince, were put through their paces by the scientists.

Describing what it was like to have his brain scanned for ‘jolly but still deeply scientific reasons’, Mr Herring said: ‘I was secretly hoping they would discover that my grey matter was special in some way or had some additional little bend or section which enabled me to be so very funny.

‘I don’t want to say that I am the next step in human evolution, that is for science to decide.’ 

Writing on his blog, he also describes how while he struggled with the counting test, some of the non-professional speakers struggled when asked to talk non-stop on a surprise topic. 

Mr Herring said: ‘It’s amazing what things can seem simple to one people are so difficult to another.’

Several other unnamed comedians have also signed up. 

However, the UCL team is particularly keen to see inside the head of Paul Merton, who regularly outshines the other panel members on the Radio 4 show. 

The researchers hope unlocking the secret of eloquence could help in the treatment of speech problems and Alzheimer’s.
