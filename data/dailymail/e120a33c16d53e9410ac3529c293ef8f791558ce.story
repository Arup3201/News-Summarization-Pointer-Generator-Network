Izet Hajrovic scored to give Bosnia-Herzegovina a 1-0 win over Mexico in Chicago.

The Galatasaray winger finished clinically from around nine yards in the 42nd minute, after a cut-back from the left by Sejad Salihovic.

Edin Dzeko had spurned earlier chances for the World Cup debutants, while Mexico striker Javier Hernandez hit the left post before the goal arrived.
