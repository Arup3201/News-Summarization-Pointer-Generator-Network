Outrage: Abdul Al-Faisal, 19, was given a caution after breaking into his school to retrieve his hat

Police have wiped the record of a teenager with Down's Syndrome who visited his school on a bank holiday to find his favourite hat after 120,000 people signed an online petition.

Abdul Al-Faisal, 19, set off an alarm in May by climbing through a window at Haringey Sixth Form Centre in Tottenham, north London, where he had left his basketball cap in a classroom.

His panicked mother Roshina, who reported him missing, then discovered to her horror that he had been arrested and was in a cell 'confused and in tears... without shoes'.

She said he remained at Wood Green police station for nine hours before signing a formal caution for burglary.

This was an admission of guilt which remained on the record of the teenager, who his mother said has a mental age of between 10 and 12.

Ms Al-Faisal promptly complained to the Metropolitan Police, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and her local MP David Lammy.

But it was an online petition which drew headlines as 120,000 people expressed their outrage over how Abdul was treated.

The petition, started by the teenager's mother, said: 'He left the house without us realising, and he walked to his school.

'We called police to report him missing after searching streets near our home for two hours, and we were horrified to learn he had been arrested.

'I went to the police station and found my son confused and in tears in a cell without his shoes or coat.

'His fingerprints had been taken, he had been swabbed for DNA and his details had been put on record.  

The Met Police have now wiped the teenager's caution and DNA from their database, Ms Al-Faisal said.

Police have now also offered an appointment for Abdul to meet police officers because he has been 'terrified' of them since the incident, she added.

Abdul's mother wrote: 'We are very happy with this result!

'We are grateful to all those who took time out to sign our petition and support us and Abdulkarriem, in other ways. It made a massive difference, we know that for a fact.'

An IPCC spokesman said the incident was referred to the watchdog, but it was decided an independent probe was not needed and the Met Police would carry out an internal review instead.

Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down’s Syndrome Association, said: 'The Down’s Syndrome Association is delighted to hear that Abdul Al-Faisal has had his police record wiped. We would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to Police Forces across the country to take advantage of our extensive training programme.'

MailOnline has contacted the Met Police for comment.
