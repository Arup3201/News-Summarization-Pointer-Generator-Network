Hand transplants are being denied to English patients because of a bureaucratic NHS row, Britain’s leading expert said last night.

In the meantime, Scottish patients can jump the queue and be treated in England while the dispute drags on.

Professor Simon Kay performed the UK’s first hand transplant a year ago on former pub landlord Mark Cahill, 52.

Potential hand transplant patients are being denied surgery because of a funding row, says the surgeon who performed the first transplant surgery on Mark Cahill (pictured) last year. Mr Cahill is progressing well

Success: Mr Cahilll's doctors say they are very pleased with his progress. He is gaining improved movement and feeling in his new hand

Professor Kay and his team at Leeds 
General Infirmary performed the pioneering operation on Mark Cahill, who
 is gradually regaining feeling in his hand.

But no further operations have since been carried out - despite two patients being assessed as suitable for the procedure.

It may not be until 2015 until these patients can undergo surgery and the delays follow the biggest-ever reconfiguration of the NHS. 

Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), which have been given charge of the bulk of NHS spending - including hand transplant surgery - are refusing to finance the operations, claiming it is the responsibility of NHS England which pays for specialised care.

The funding dispute is believed to be among a number due to the complex shake-up in April.

Internationally-renowned specialist Professor Kay, who heads the transplant team in Leeds, said he was frustrated at the delay.

Both patients, one from the East of England and another from London, could be operated on 'immediately' if funding of £66,000 for the first year was available, with further life-time costs mainly for anti-rejection drugs running into several thousand pounds a year.

Frustrated: Because of the funding row, Professor Kay says he will most likely operate on a Scottish patient next - in England

'We are saying this is clearly the responsibility of the CCGs,' said Professor Kay, 'If they want to say no to it, they have to give a good clinical reason and there isn't one.

'Surgery would be life transforming for both patients. We could go ahead now - we are up and ready to go.

'NHS England have been very constructive. The people who haven't got up to speed are the CCGs in this respect. We certainly hope it can be resolved. They really do need to understand the value for their patients and move quickly.'

Instead, a patient from Scotland is likely to be the next to undergo a transplant in the summer as funding north of the border - which has had no re-organisation - is still available.

Professor Kay added: 'It will mean a Scottish patient will have treatment in England when an English patient can't at the moment. It really does need to be sorted out.'

The team say they are very pleased with the progress of Mr Cahill, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, who is gaining improved movement and feeling in his new hand.

Mr Cahill, 52, a former pub landlord, said: 'It's something I've been very proud to have. I think it's super.'

He left the infirmary three weeks after the transplant but regularly attends the hospital for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology, as well as checks from the team.

NHS England said: 'The specialised services that are the responsibility of NHS England are set out in regulations and are determined by Ministers. Other hospital services are the responsibility of CCGs, including, at present, hand transplant.

"Ministers are looking at whether, during the next phase of deciding which services will be specialised, this service should become a prescribed service. 

'In the meantime it remains the responsibility of CCGs to decide whether this surgery should be funded or not.'
