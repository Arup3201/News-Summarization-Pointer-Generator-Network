Around 42,500 Kenmore oscillating heaters sold at Sears and Kmart stores last fall are being recalled as of yesterday due to the fact that they may overheat and cause a fire.

Since Kmart and Walmart sold the heaters across the United States between September and November 2013, they received notice of seven of them catching fire and two injuries.

The U.S. Consumer Product safety 
Commission said that a broken motor mount can cause the heating units 
to  burst into flames and then ignite nearby objects.

According to Recall Owl, injuries include one report of smoke inhalation and one report of a blister to a consumer's finger.

The heaters cost around $35 to $40, are gray and white and measure 12 inches tall by 9 inches wide, reports The Chicago Tribune.

Officials have instructed customers to turn off the units as soon as possible, unplug them, then return them for a full refund.

Customers can call Sears and Kmart toll-free at (888) 820-3341 from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday.

They can also visit the firms' websites at www.sears.com and www.kmart.com and click on Product Recall for more information.
