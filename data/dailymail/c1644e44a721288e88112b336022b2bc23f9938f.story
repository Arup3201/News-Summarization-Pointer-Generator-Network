Jonathan Cheban was in a Brooklyn courtroom Tuesday following an incident that happened this past summer in a Brooklyn restaurant.

Cheban was out enjoying a night of sushi in Brooklyn with some pals and his bodyguard, Saverio 'Sal the Contractor' Carollo, on June 1 when a man started heckling the group.

Denis Volchkin, 28, claims he approached the group to speak with a friend he knew and was then told by Cheban to get on his way.

Trouble: Sal (left) was charged with assault following a June incident in which he punched a man who was bad mouthing Cheban (right)

Odd turn: The man who Sal punched, Denis Volchkin, was shot dead by police in October after lunging at two officers with a knife

'He said, 'Get away, you don’t see a scene here, get away from the table',' Volchkin told the New York Post.

Then, towards the end of the evening, Cheban overheard Volchkin bad mouthing him to someone over the phone, and a heated argument began.

A manager tried to break it up, and then, as can be seen in the surveillance  video, Sal the Contractor punches Volchkin in the eye.

He reportedly suffered multiple facial fractures and needed several stitches.

All set: The District Attorney moved to dismiss the charges against Sal on Tuesday

BFF: Cheban and his bud Kim Kardashian in Cannes this May

Volchkin then sued the restaurant, sushi miKasa by Kevin, which Cheban is a partial owner of, for leaking a tape of the incident to TMZ.

Then, in August, Sal the Contractor was arrested for the incident by police and identified in a lineup by Volchkin.

He was charged with assault, which is why he and Cheban appeared in court on Tuesday along with Cheban's lawyer, Igor Vaysberg.

The District Attorney ultimately moved to dismiss all charges on Tuesday. 

This is no doubt partially because of the tragic turn this all took on October 3 when Volckin was shot dead in his mother's Brooklyn home after charging at two police officers with a knife.

They had been called to the house, in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, by his mother, Liliya Pilipenko, after he barged in and began choking her following an argument.

On his way: There is more drama on the horizon for Cheban, who gets into a big fight with pal Kim Kardashian on this week's episode of Khloe and Kourtney Take the Hamptons 

Letting her have it: Cheban tells Kim to 'go fu*k herself' after she accuses him of leaking tabloid stories

In other Cheban drama, the former publicist will be going toe-to-toe with best friend Kim Kardashian on this week's episode of Khloe and Kourtney Take the Hamptons after the girls all accuse him of leaking private information about them to the tabloids.

And while no fists will be flying, Cheban does tell Kim at one point, 'go f--k yourself.' 

Cheban has been palling around New York with Kim's mother Kris Jenner all week though, so it seems that everyone made up in the end.
