Republican lawmakers are holding their ground and refusing to fund the proposals President Barack Obama  laid out in his State of the Union address.

Having already panned his pitches as 'unserious' and 'dead on arrival,' Republicans are now threatening to shred most of Obama's budget, due for release on Tuesday, the moment it lands on their desks.

'He is the most liberal, fiscally irresponsible president we’ve had in history,' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told the Washington Post after seeing a preview of the president's spending requests. 'I don’t know why he doesn’t see it.'

The White House on Thursday admitted that it doesn't expect the president's budget to pass 'in its current form.' Rather, it considers the document 'a way that we can codify our values and our priorities.'

Obama told Democrats on Thursday he would ask for a $74 billion in 2015 above the ceiling mandated by a bipartisan agreement. The White House confirmed that Obama will ask Congress to trash the sequester. 

'No way,' Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said in response to the news.

'Initial peak at Pres budget shows same wonderland mentality that Washington can tax and spend its way to prosperity Am ppl can't be fooled,' Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted. 

Hatch told the Post the U.S. is 'facing a debt crisis not because Americans are taxed too little but because the government spends too much.'

In his State of the Union address Obama presented an ambitious framework of revenue increases that place even higher tax burdens on financial institutions and wealthy Americans and would raise $320 billion over 10 years to pay for his favored programs. 

But Republicans have firmly dismissed any attempt to increase revenues through those means.

'I don’t know any Republican, myself included, that would support any of that,' Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters last week, using the 'dead on arrival' refrain.

'I think it's pretty clear that that’s a non-starter, and I think the president knows that,' Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock told Daily Mail Online.

'Those kind of tax increases would just be devastating to the economy. And you know we still have a very fragile economy.' 

Republican after Republican has slammed the new measures as bad for the same Americans it purports to help - the middle class - since his joint appearance before Congress last week.

'President Obama stayed the course of tax, spend, borrow, regulate, and add to the debt. This policy has hammered working families,' Alabama's other senator, Jeff Sessions, also a Republican, said in a statement.

'Instead of trying to manipulate our tax code to punish success, President Obama should work with Congress to fundamentally reform our tax code in ways that will grow our entire economy and provide relief to all families,' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz contended that Obama was tone-deaf and did not 'hear' the American peoples' message in November when they ousted his party from power in the upper chamber.

'He intends to do precisely the opposite' of what they voted for, Cruz said. 'He intends to double down on the failed policies of the last six years. He intends to have yet more and more government spending and taxes and debt and all of the policies that are hurting hardworking Americans.'

House Speaker John Boehner accused Obama of 'more of the same approach that has failed middle-class families.' 

'Unnserious proposals may make for good political theater, he said, but 'they will not distract this new American Congress from our focus on the people's priorities.'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that in digging in his heels Obama 'missed' and opportunity for 'bipartisan, constructive engagement.'

'We know the president may not be wild about the people’s choice of a Congress. But he owes it to the American people to find a serious way to work with the representatives they elected,' the GOP leader said.

Moderate Democrats are waiting until Obama's budget is unveiled to determine whether Obama and the White House 'have really gone too far left,' Matt Bennett, co-founder of left-aligned group Third Way indicated to Politico.

'We are big believers in dealing with the long-term mandatory spending crisis and driving economic growth for the middle class,' he said of his organization, 'and we hope to see some of that when the whole budget comes out.'

Obama has already had to strike one of his changes to the tax code from his budget in the last week after he faced blow back from Republicans and Democrats alike, including the top Democrat in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin.

The president wanted to amend the rules pertaining to popular college savings accounts often referred to as 529s as part of his plan to reform the tax code. Used most often by the wealthy, the White House wanted to begin taxing withdraws from the investment accounts. 

Democrats argued that too many middle income Americans use the accounts, though, for that to be a smart source of revenue for Obama's free community college tuition plan that's been promoted as a boon for average American families. 

Building on the State of the Union, Obama offered a preview of his budget on Thursday in an op-ed for the Huffington Post.

'We have to build on the bipartisan budget agreement I signed in 2013 that helped us end some of the arbitrary, across-the-board budget cuts known as "sequestration," ' the president wrote.

'In order to get wages and incomes rising faster, we need to take the next step. That's why my Budget will fully reverse the sequestration cuts for domestic priorities in 2016.'

Not only does the president intend to give the Department of Defense back the money it would lose next fiscal year if the sequester were allowed to take effect, he will propose 'equal dollar increases for defense funding.'

'If Congress rejects my plan and refuses to undo these arbitrary cuts, it will threaten our economy and our military,' he said in his op-ed. 'Investments in key areas will fall to their lowest level in ten years, adjusted for inflation, putting American research, education, infrastructure, and national security at risk. 

'But if Congress joins me, we can make sure that ending sequestration is fully paid for by cutting inefficient spending and closing tax loopholes.'

The White House said Thursday that the president's budget is based on his belief that is possible to 'make our tax code fairer and more simple, and do it all in a way that’s fiscally responsible.' 

Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest said, the White House believes 'there is a better way that we could have succeeded in reducing the deficit' than sequestration - and that would have been to raise tax rates on Wall Street.

'But in some ways, those are debates for the past. What we want to talk about now is the future. And I do think that the strategy that the President has laid out - focusing on middle-class families - is one that certainly deserves strong bipartisan support in the Congress,' he said.

Earnest contended that 'no President has ever put forward a budget with the expectation that Congress is going to pass it in its current form,' he said, even when the executive and legislative branches of government were controlled by the same party. 

Still, President Obama's budget is 'important,' he said, because it 'codifies the President’s values and vision for the country.'

'But Republicans in Congress will certainly have their say and we look forward to seeing what they put forward,' he noted.

Looming cuts to defense spending is a problem that Obama and Republicans who favor a robust military agree must be resolved.

At a Senate Armed Forces hearing on the sequester on Wednesday the committee's chair, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said the U.S. is en route to shaving $1 trillion off of its  defense budget by they year 2021.

'If we in Congress do not act,' McCain said, and the sequester goes into effect next year, Congress will be 'setting our military on a far more dangerous course.'

'Why would we do this to ourselves now?' he said, recalling the global crises of late, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ISIS' violent rampage across Iraq and Syria.

McCain said the Army and Marine Corps won't have enough forces if the sequester kicks in and the Air Force won't have enough planes. The aircraft the Air Force will in many cases 'be too old,' he said.

Continuing, he warned, 'Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will not get the training or equipment they need. And it will become increasingly difficult for them to respond to any number of contingencies that could threaten our national interests around the world.'

Quoting retired United States Marine Corps General James Mattis, who spoke to the committee on Tuesday, McCain said: ‘No foe in the field can wreck such havoc on our security that mindless sequestration is achieving.’ 

McCain ally, Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina told Fox News he'd even consider tax increases to stop sequestration.

'Whatever it takes within reason to get this problem fixed is what I'm willing to do,' he said, adding that he'd do what it takes 'just to get the damn thing done.'

Graham's eagerness to raise revenues to save the military is not shared by the entire Republican Party.

'A lot of this gets down to whether or not the president is willing to work through tax reform and entitlement reform, or decide he wants to raise taxes,' Republican Rep. Tom Cole told the Post.

'I don’t believe Republicans are willing to raise taxes.'
