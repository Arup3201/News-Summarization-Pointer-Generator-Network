Crystal Palace ended their pre-season tour of the United States unbeaten with a resounding 3-0 defeat of the Richmond Kickers at City Stadium in Richmond, Virginia.

The Kickers, who play in the lower leagues of US soccer, were no match for a strong Palace side that will now head back to England to prepare for the Premier League season.

After a lacklustre start to the game that saw neither keeper tested, the Eagles opened the scoring on 35 minutes when Peter Ramage headed home from a Jason Puncheon corner.

Dwight Gayle thought he had doubled their lead shortly after when he prodded home from Joe Ledley's low cross only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.

Tony Pulis made no changes to the side after the interval, although Marouane Chamakh and Ramage switched shirt numbers to 6 and 23 respectively.

Glen Murray doubled the lead with another headed goal coming from a corner ten minutes after the restart.

Pulis decided to ring the changes shortly after the second goal, bringing on the likes of Barry Bannan, Stuart O'Keefe, Adlene Guedioura and Jerome Thomas.

And it was Bannan who provided the cross for yet another headed goal, this time from former Arsenal striker Chamakh, who was substituted for Boateng immediately after.

In their previous two games, Palace drew 2-2 with Columbus on 24 July and defeated Philadelphia 1-0 on 26 July.

The Eagles begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal at the Emirates on 16 August.
