Wearing only loincloths and with their arms stretched in the air, these men look like they are begging for a set of clothes.

But they are, in fact, trying to grab a pair of lucky sticks being thrown by a priest at a temple in Okayama, Japan.

The sacred batons - measuring 4cm in diameter and 20cm in length - are believed to bring good luck for an entire year to whoever catches them.

Unusual sight: More than 9,000 Japanese men can be seen trying to grab a pair of lucky sticks thrown by a priest during the Hadaka Matsuri at Saidaiji Temple today

More than 9,000 men took part in the Hadaka Matsuri - known as the Naked Festival - at Saidaiji Temple today.

They donned white Japanese loincloths with the help of their peers, before stepping into cold fountains, where they purified their bodies with water.

They then battled fiercely with each other in a bid to grab the pair of lucky sticks - known as the shingi - which were thrown into the crowd by a priest from a four-metre high window.

According to Japanese tradition, anyone who gets catches the items and thrusts them in a wooden measuring box, called the masu, is blessed with 12 months of luck and happiness.

The unusual event - one of the most vibrant festivals in Japan - dates back 500 years when worshippers used to compete to receive paper talismans thrown by the priest.Â 

Over the years, an increasing number of people receiving these talismans possessed good fortune - encouraging more worshippers to turn up.

However, the talismans were later changed to wooden sticks due to the fragile nature of paper.

The Hadaka Matsuri is not the only festival in Japan which requires participants to bare all.

Last month, around 100 men took part in the ancient Shinto festival of Kanchu Misogi - a winter purification ritual that is supposed to cleanse the body and soul and bring worshippers closer to mystical spirits, which they believe can bring them success.

In temperatures of just 40F (6C), the participants stripped down to loincloths and headbands before taking a dip in the pool at Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine.

They then crouched down in the freezing water to pray - before hugging large blocks of ice.
