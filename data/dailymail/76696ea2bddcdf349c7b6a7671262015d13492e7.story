Penny-pinching pensioner: Glynne Evans, 71, has become Britain's oldest community service workers after being handed 100 hours for benefit fraud

A retired nanny aged 71 has become the oldest defendant known to have been given community service.

Glynne Evans was given 100 hours at Teesside Crown Court for an £18,000 benefit fraud. But she won’t be clearing ditches and is likely to have to work in a hospice or charity shop.

A Probation Service source said: 'We’ve never had one quite so old, but I’m sure we’ll find something suitable.'

Evans, of Eaglescliffe, near Stockton, claimed pension credits as a single person while living with her partner.

In
an interview with a probation worker, she seemed to regard it as a 
victimless crime committed by accident.

But Judge Howard Crowson told 
her: 'There is £18,000 missing as a result. This can’t be brushed under 
the carpet.

'It seems you are someone who is public-spirited and you can pay off your debt to society by working for it.'

Peter Wishlade, mitigating, told Teesside Crown Court that Evans looked after her 93-year-old neighbour.

'She might be 71, but she’s a fit 71,' said Mr Wishlade, who suggested a curfew if it meant avoiding prison.

Judge Crowson said: 'I’m not sure it will be a great punishment, having to stay in her home in the winter.'

Evans admitted fraud by false 
representation at an earlier hearing.

The court heard how she made bogus
claims for pension credits between 2006 and 2012 as a single person.

Mr
Wishlade said the claims were made 'at a time of great stress' and said
the benefits system was 'complex'.

Since her arrest last year, Evans 
has been repaying £150 a month from her private and state pensions.

Judge
Crowson said: 'I am asked to consider this as a victimless crime, 
committed by someone by accident. It’s £18,000. Do you think the public 
think that’s a drop in the ocean?

'I’m pleased to see it’s being repaid.'
