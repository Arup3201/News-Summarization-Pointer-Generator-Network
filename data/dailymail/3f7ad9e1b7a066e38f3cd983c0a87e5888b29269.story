Hillary Rodham Clinton has told a German magazine that she will work to make sure the United States is led by a woman â€” even if it's not her.

Clinton told weekly Stern that the U.S. lags behind countries such as Germany, Chile and Brazil because it's never had a woman as head of state or government.

'We are way behind you in Germany on this,' she said in excerpts obtained by Reuters.

Who, me? Hillary Clinton, seen here on June 13, has told a German magazine she will do 'all that she can' to make sure the US is led by a woman

'Of course I want the U.S.A. to have a woman leader soon as well and I will do all I can for that to happen, though I don't know yet if it will be me.'

Though the former secretary of state hasn't yet announced whether she will run for president in 2016, she has been busy promoting her new book, 'Hard Choices.'

On Monday Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor dropped by Clinton's book signing at a Costco warehouse in suburban Virginia, and surprised the former secretary of state.

Who knows? Clinton has not yet publicly announced if she will run for the presidency in 2016

Clinton shouted that she couldn't believe it.

Sotomayor told reporters she was 'just shopping' and decided to get a signed copy of Clinton's new book.

The Saturday morning book event attracted more than 1,000 people, including Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal and a few former Clinton aides and relatives.

The potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate autographed copies for nearly three hours.The former first lady kicked off her book tour this week, with stops in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.
