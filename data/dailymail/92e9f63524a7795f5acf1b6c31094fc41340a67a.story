A newly-wed Philadelphia couple on their honeymoon dreamed of one day having a family, little imagining that around eight months later they would be parents to identical triplets.

Allison and Wes Rhoa welcomed Ava, Avery and Alissa into the world by cesearean section earlier this month at Abingdon Memorial Hospital.

The chance of having naturally conceived identical triplets without any fertility aid is about one in a million.

Three sisters: The babies can't feed by themselves yet but within three weeks they'll be ready to go home

'She got pregnant when we were in Mexico on our honeymoon,' Wes told CBS Philadelphia.

The couple, while elated, are still in shock at their newly-expanded family.

'I still can’t believe it that it happened.  So it was definitely something we weren’t expecting, but we couldn’t be happier now that they’re here,' said Allison.

Deep end: The new parents are now adjusting for caring for three newborns

The babies were born when Allison was 33 weeks along and each tiny bundle weighed about four pounds.

Unusually for premature babies, they were all able to breath for themselves.

They're still in hospital because they can't feed on their own yet, but the couple expect to take them home within two or three weeks.

Little angels: The Rhoas chose three names starting with A and the middle names Hope, Faith and Grace

'As soon as you’re done feeding all three and the other ones are rested you’ve got to start all over again.  So it’s non-stop,' Wes told CBS Philadelphia.

They've got their work cut out for the once the little ones come home.

'We did Grace, Faith and Hope as the middle names,' Wes Rhoa told CBS Philadelphia.
