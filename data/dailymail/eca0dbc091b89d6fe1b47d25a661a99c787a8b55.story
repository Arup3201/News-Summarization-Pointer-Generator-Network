A businessman given a life sentence after being found guilty of murdering his wife and seven-year-old daughter in New Zealand has won an appeal after challenging his conviction in a British court.

New Zealander Mark Lundy asked the judicial committee of the Privy Council - which sits in London - to analyse his case more than a decade after his conviction.

A New Zealand jury concluded in 2002 that he had attacked wife Christine and daughter Amber with a 'tomahawk-like weapon' at the family home in Palmerston North, north of Wellington, New Zealand.

Five judges - four from the UK Supreme Court plus a senior New Zealand judge - heard Lundy’s appeal at a hearing in the Supreme Court building in central London in June. They delivered a ruling today.

The judicial committee of the Privy Council was the highest court of appeal for the British Empire and can hear appeals from cases originating in Commonwealth - or former Commonwealth - countries.

Legal experts said the judicial committee of the Privy Council was effectively sitting as a New Zealand Supreme Court. They said New Zealand now has a Supreme Court but did not have one when Lundy was convicted.

Judges unanimously allowed Lundy’s appeal and said another trial should be held.

The judges said new evidence had emerged which cast doubt on the methods prosecutors used to establish the times of death.

They said that, in the light of that, Lundy’s conviction could not be considered safe.

Lundy, who is now in his mid-50s, was convicted of the killings in a 2002 trial in New Zealand and lost his initial appeal there.

The council said he should remain in prison in New Zealand until his bail request can be heard there.
