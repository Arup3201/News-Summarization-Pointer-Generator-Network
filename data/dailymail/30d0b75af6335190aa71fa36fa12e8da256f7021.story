Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus is out of Arsenal's Champions League visit to the Westfalenstadion after partially tearing his ankle ligaments against Scotland.

The Germany star has been ruled out for four weeks after a tackle by Charlie Mulgrew left him on the floor. 

Arsenal travel to Germany on September 16 to face Dortmund in the Champions League group stage - the third time in four years that the clubs have been drawn together - and Reus will not return until early October at the earliest.

Absent: Reus' club Borussia Dortmund broke the news of his injury on Twitter

His club tweeted that he had a partial lateral ligament tear on his left ankle, which would keep him out for approximately four weeks, along with the message 'get well soon'.

Reus has struggled with injuries in the last year, missing his country's World Cup triumph with a similar injury.

He returned to the Dortmund side early this season, providing a goal and an assist in his second game back against Augsburg. 

But the player will now be sidelined again, leading Germany's goalscorer on the night Thomas Muller to call his luck 'unbelievable'.

'Unbelievable how much bad luck someone can have in their national team shirt - I hope he's not out for too long,' said Muller.
