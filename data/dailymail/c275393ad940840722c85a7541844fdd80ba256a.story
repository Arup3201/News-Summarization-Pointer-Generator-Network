The body of the fourth victim of a North Sea helicopter crash was recovered from the aircraft wreckage today, as all Super Puma flights to and from British oil rigs were suspended.

Helicopter operator CHC said it has grounded the AS332 L2 aircraft which ditched without warning into the North Sea off Shetland while carrying 18 workers on Friday evening, killing four people.

The company has also suspended all UK commercial flights of three other Super Puma models following a recommendation from an aviation safety association.

Investigation: The wreckage of the Super Puma L2 helicopter which went down in the North Sea with the loss of four lives at 6.20pm on Friday, around two miles west of Sumburgh Airport on Shetland

Response: The wreckage floats on the surface as the operation to recover the helicopter and the last of the four bodies was completed today

The offshore industry's Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) urged the precautionary measure until there is ‘sufficient factual information’ to resume flights.

Rescuers have now recovered the final body from the site of the crash around two miles west of Sumburgh Airport. The cause of the accident is not yet known.

Those who died have been named as Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham; George Allison, 57, from Winchester, Hampshire; Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin in the Highlands and 59-year-old Gary McCrossan, from Inverness.

The helicopter was being operated by CHC for oil company Total and was transporting workers from the Borgsten Dolphin platform when it is believed to have experienced a ‘catastrophic’ loss of power as it approached the airport on the southern tip of Shetland's main island.

The HSSG is made up of representatives from oil and gas firms, contractors, helicopter operators, offshore unions, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

The group met in Aberdeen yesterday and recommended the temporary suspension of all Super Puma commercial passenger flights to and from the UK's oil and gas installations. This includes the AS332 L, L1, L2 and EC225 models.

CHC said it was ‘devastated’ by the accident and would follow the recommendation, which allows for the operation of emergency rescue flights.

Fellow operators Bond Offshore Helicopters and Bristow have also enforced a temporary suspension of Super Puma flights.

Bristow said three flights scheduled for today had been cancelled and further updates would be issued in due course.

The HSSG will meet again on Wednesday to review the suspension unless ‘any significant information come to light before this date’.

Industry body Oil & Gas UK has meanwhile arranged a meeting of operators and major contractors tomorrow to discuss ways of minimising the impact of the grounding of flights on the offshore workforce.

Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said the government did not anticipate that the temporary suspension would have any immediate impact on the production of oil and gas in the North Sea but that the situation would be closely monitored.

‘My thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives and I hope those who were injured make a good recovery,’ he said.

Of the 14 survivors, two remain in hospital on Shetland and 12 returned to Aberdeen yesterday.

One Total employee was on board and the remainder worked for contract companies, including those killed. Mr Munro leaves behind wife Penny and 12-year-old daughter Katie.

His family said in a statement: ‘He will be sadly missed by everyone that knew him and his death will leave a large void in a lot of people's lives.’

Ms Darnley's family paid tribute to a ‘fun-loving, free spirit’ who was brought up in Elgin and moved to Aberdeen aged 19.

The offshore worker is survived by parents Anne and Edmund Darnley, her sister Angela and nephew Nicholas.

Confirmed dead:  Duncan 
Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and 59-year-old Gary McCrossan, from 
Inverness

Tragedy: George Allison, 57, from Winchester, and Sarah Darnley, 45, 
from Elgin

Her mother Anne said: ‘We are shocked by the sudden loss of Sarah, who was a fun-loving free spirit who will be sorely missed.

‘Sarah lived life to the full, she was easy going and a one-off. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.’

Mr
McCrossan worked for Stork Technical Services. Mike Mann, a senior vice
president at the firm, said: ‘Our heartfelt condolences go out to 
Gary's family and to all of those affected by this tragedy.’

Victim: Mr Allison was an 'Offshore Safety Adviser, husband, father and best BBQist ever'

Mr
Allison had been working at the Offshore Dunbar Platform as a project 
safety supervisor for just over a year when he was killed, according to 
his LinkedIn profile.

He 
described himself as a ‘highly qualified, experienced and competent 
Safety Advisor’ who has worked in the offshore industry for 27 years.

A team from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch has travelled to Aberdeen to carry out initial inquiries into the incident.

There
have been five North Sea incidents involving Super Pumas since 2009. In
April that year an AS332 L2, this time operated by Bond, went down 
north east of Peterhead on its return from a BP Platform, killing all 14
passengers and two crew on board.

Pat
Rafferty, Scottish secretary of the Unite union, said: ‘This is the 
fifth major incident in the last four years involving Super Puma 
helicopters in the UK offshore industry and the second resulting in 
fatalities. It's unacceptable and it can't go on.’

Super Puma manufacturers Eurocopter said the company was ‘supporting CHC and relevant authorities with their investigations’.

A
Bond spokesman said: ‘At this time, and until further information 
becomes available, Bond Offshore Helicopters will not be operating any 
of its Super Puma aircraft fleet, with the exception of our Jigsaw 
rescue aircraft which will be available for life-at-risk missions.

The
crash came just a fortnight after global company CHC re-introduced the 
controversial Super Puma model to its stable a year after the helicopter
type was grounded due to two unexplained ditchings last year

Big operation: Lifeboats from Aith and Lerwick raced to the scene of the crash on Friday night and a ferry travelling between Shetland and Aberdeen carrying 201 passengers turned around to help with the rescue

Risky work: RNLI volunteers use an inflatable dinghy to inspect the ditched helicopter

‘All other flight operations continue as scheduled.’

Volunteer
lifeboat crews from Aith and Lerwick yesterday assisted coastguard in 
their attempt to recover the remaining body at sea and collect debris 
from the crash site.

The 
RNLI said it had not been possible to recover the remains from the 
wreckage during the operation and the crews were last night stood down.

A
spokesman said: ‘I don't anticipate we will be involved any further, 
but obviously we were happy to assist as much as we could.

‘One
cannot imagine the turmoil that families and loved ones of those who 
died must be going through, and they are at the forefront of our minds 
at this very distressing time.’

Representatives
from the oil and gas industry have set up a fundraising page in aid of 
the RNLI following its rescue effort on Friday.

The crash happened on Friday night two miles off Shetland, when the 
aircraft ‘fell like a stone’ into stormy seas while approaching the 
airport.

The helicopter flipped upside down after hitting the water, 
but 14 of those on board were able to free themselves from the wreckage.
