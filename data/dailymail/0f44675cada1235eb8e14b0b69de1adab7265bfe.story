Scientists are spending £500,000 of taxpayer’s money to see whether children’s opinions on war and the armed forces are affected by playing with dolls wearing military clothing.

Researchers from the Universities of Portsmouth, Exeter, and Royal Holloway University of London will spend three years looking in to whether dolls like Action Man help children understand the military.

They also aim to determine how action figures shape young people's views on conflict and the armed forces.

Warfare: Scientists are spending almost £500,000 on a study to see whether children's views on conflict are affected by dolls - such as these Her Majesty's Armed Forces dolls - in military clothing

The study will focus on top-selling Her Majesty’s Armed Forces (HMAF) dolls - licensed by the Ministry of Defence.

HMAF dolls are based on current British armed forces and come with an assault rifle, radio, flak jacket, body armour, helmet and goggles.

The £492,508 project is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

Researchers are expected to report their findings in 2016, shortly after the withdrawal of British troops from Afghanistan.

Research: Scientists will use a variety of dolls, such as these Action Men, to gauge how they shape young people's perception of the military

Research collaborator Professor Klaus 
Dodds said: 'We are not examining whether war toys are good or bad, or 
the psychology of such play.

Findings: The results of the study - which will use dolls like GI Joe, pictured - will be published in 2016

'We will be examining how such toys 
help shape British attitudes to our armed forces and what ideas children
are incorporating from outside sources, such as television news 
footage.

'The war on terror 
is being played out everywhere and since 9/11, our security and 
surveillance has come under intense examination.

'Understanding war, conflict and security in modern life is an urgent task for social scientists.'

The current best-seller in the doll range is a ten-inch high infantry soldier in desert combats - an image that is often seen on television news about Afghanistan.

Principal investigator Dr Tara Woodyer added: 'Play has frequently been overlooked as irrelevant to how people come to understand the world.

'Yet it is precisely this apparent banality, the taken for granted nature of play, that allows its role to go unchallenged.

'Toys, and how children play with them, are not just a response to the world, they help shape our culture.

'The role of action figure dolls has been unduly neglected, especially given the enormous academic attention focused on their female equivalent, Barbie.'

The action figure toy arrived in the UK as a repackaged American GI Joe toy in 1966 and was then re-branded as Action Man, which ceased to be made in 2006.
