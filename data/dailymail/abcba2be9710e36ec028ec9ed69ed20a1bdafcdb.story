Education Secretary Michael Gove is said to be delighted at his daughter securing a place at a state school

Michael Gove has chosen a state secondary school for his daughter.

Beatrice,
 10, has secured a place at a popular Church of England girls’ 
comprehensive at the heart of Westminster - her first choice school.

Mr Gove is believed to be the first Conservative education secretary to choose a state secondary for his child.

The
 minister and his wife, Sarah Vine, a Daily Mail columnist, are said to 
be ‘delighted’ their daughter will go to the Grey Coat Hospital School.

Founded
 in 1698, the school specialises in the teaching of languages and 
encourages first year pupils to learn at least two, with the option of 
studying Latin and Greek.

Judged
 ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in 2009, the school, which has strong links 
with Westminster Abbey, is typically at least five times oversubscribed 
for its 150 places.

It places pupils in ability bands to allocate places as well as prioritising church-going families.

The uniform at the school includes a grey coat, as the name suggests, costing between £65 and £85.

According
 to the 2009 report, two-thirds of pupils are from ethnic minority 
backgrounds and one third speak English as a second language.

Unlike
 his predecessors as Education Secretary and several other leading 
Tories, Mr Gove was determined to send his children to a state school.

Brian
 Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College 
Leaders, said: 'We would suggest that all cabinet ministers follow Mr 
Gove's example and send their children to one of the country's many fine
 state schools.'

Writing in 
her column today, Miss Vine said: 'I want to support the state sector 
not just because, as a UK taxpayer and a tight-wad, I would resent 
paying twice for my children’s education.

'Or
 because, having watched my friends go through the hell of trying to get
 their offspring into high-flying private schools, I decided to spare 
mine the anguish.

“But 
mostly because I believe that at state school Beatrice will receive a 
far more comprehensive education - in every sense of the phrase - than 
at any private establishment.”.

In a speech earlier this year at the 
London Academy of Excellence, he lauded a ‘renaissance’ in state 
education, insisting many schools state schools were as good as, if not 
better than, some in the private sector.

While the Gove's were successful in securing their first choice school, others were not so lucky.

More than four in ten children in some areas were denied their preferred secondary school amid mounting competition for places

Tens of thousands of ten and 
11-year-olds found they had  missed out as allocations were announced by
 councils across the country.

Many
 areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding 
decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice 
schools.

The allocations to more than half a million families are likely to see a surge in appeals.

Law firm Maxwell Gillott warned the system can be a ‘minefield’ for parents.

Research by the Mail shows a booming population in many towns and cities is fuelling rising demand for secondary places.

In
 London, where the demand for secondary school places rose 5 per cent in
 a year, 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice 
school – up slightly on last year.

This rose to 42 per cent in the boroughs of Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham and 41 per cent in Wandsworth.

In
 Bristol, the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 
per cent, leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice 
school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013.

‘The
 rise in reception pupil numbers seen in 2007/08 is starting to filter 
through to secondary schools.

'There has also been general population 
growth in the area,’ said a spokesman.

In
 Birmingham, where applications also rose, 30 per cent were rejected by 
their first choice – up from 26 per cent.

Buckinghamshire, meanwhile, 
was unable to offer places to 22 per cent.

Around one in seven youngsters are expected to miss out on first choice schools.

Under
 the admissions system, parents list their school  preferences.

They are
 then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria, 
which are mainly based on a family’s proximity.

Other
 factors can include random lotteries or ability banding – measures 
aimed at preventing middle-class parents playing the system by moving 
into catchment areas.

Banding involves all pupils being tested, with a 
set number of bright, average and low ability children admitted.

Competition
 is particularly intense for places at grammar and faith schools, as 
well as flagship free schools and academies, which are funded by the 
taxpayer but free from local government interference.

Tiffin
 School in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, saw 1,863 boys sitting the 
11-plus test, competing for 160 places.

The West London Free School, in Hammersmith, had nearly 10 applicants for each of its 120 places

The West London Free School, 
founded by journalist Toby Young, had 1,124 applications for 120 places.

Matt
 Richards, senior director of www.schoolappeals.com, said: ‘Most people 
are happy with a good school, they don’t necessarily want an outstanding
 school, but if there isn’t one in your area then you have a problem.

‘There are areas where schools are still failing.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Every parent deserves the chance to send their child to a good school.

‘The number of children in failing secondary schools has already fallen by a quarter of a million since 2010.’

Parents
 apply to a local authority for a place for their child each year, and 
those wanting a place at a secondary school for September 2014 had to 
apply by 31 October last year.

Depending on where they live, families will either find out today or tomorrow where their child has been allocated a place.

The schools set their own admissions criteria and admissions are dealt with by the local authority.

For
 example, faith schools give preference to children who practise the 
religion of the school, while others may prioritise those with siblings 
already at the school or those who do well in an entrance exam.

For some, study alone will not be enough - and their parents will have to appeal the school's decision (file image)

Parents may list up to a
 certain number of schools in order of preference on their application 
form - in London boroughs with larger numbers of schools that can mean 
up to six schools, while in other areas they may be allowed to list a 
smaller number - for example, parents in Bristol can list a maximum of 
three.

Unlike with primary 
schools, where catchment areas are all-important and house prices go up 
as a result, where you live is not usually as important a factor in most
 secondary applications.

There
 is no guarantee that children will be offered a place at their first or
 even third choice school - some will be offered a place at a school 
they did not apply to and have no wish to go to.

There
 is a deadline date of 17 March (in most local authority areas) for 
parents to respond to the offer they are given, either to accept the 
school place offered or to appeal a decision or place a child on a 
waiting list.  Places become available at schools when parents decide to
 send their child to a private school, look elsewhere for schools or to 
home-educate their children instead. 

Parents
 who have appealed a school's decision not to offer their child a place 
will have their appeal heard by an independent panel.  They will first 
check your child meets all the school's admissions criteria, and should 
come back to you with a decision within a week.
