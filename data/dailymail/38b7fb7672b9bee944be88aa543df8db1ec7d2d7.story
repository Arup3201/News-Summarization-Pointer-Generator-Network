The original manuscript for Don McLean's iconic hit 'American Pie' is set to fetch $1.5million when it is sold at auction later this year.

The 16-page handwritten and typed draft, which includes notes and deletions is to go under the hammer at Christie's in New York in April.

The song was released in 1971 and was named Song of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Mr McLean, who is now 69, says he decided to sell the manuscript for the song, which he wrote in Cold Springs, New York and Philadelphia, on a whim.

He has previously admitted that the beginning of the eight-minute tune is about the death of singer Buddy Holly, who died in a plane crash with Ritchie Valens and JP Richardson in 1959.

However, he has been elusive about the meaning behind most of the lyrics, which has heightened interest and led to countless interpretations.

Mr McLean said: 'I wanted to capture, probably before it was ever formulated, a rock-and-roll American dream.

Mr McLean, pictured in 1972, has been elusive about the meaning behind many of the lyrics in the song 

'The writing and the lyrics will divulge everything there is to divulge.'

Francis Wahlgren, the international director of printed books and manuscripts at Christie's, said American Pie holds an important place in the history of music.

He added: 'The fact that the drafts, the working process of it, are all being offered as this lot makes it a remarkable insight into the mind of Don McLean and into this incredible song that has touched so many people.

'There is something about this song that captures the era of that period and there is a kind of innocence to it, a loss of innocence in America.'

However, the lot is not expected to break the record for a hand-written script after the original Bob Dylan lyrics for 'Like A Rolling Stone' sold for just over $2million at auction last year.

It shattered the previous record of $1.2million for John Lennon's lyrics for 'A Day in the Life'.

Mr Wahlgreen added: 'We've seen records double or triple for manuscripts in a matter of years because there has been a heightened interest in those very rare and truly significant manuscripts that come on the market.'
