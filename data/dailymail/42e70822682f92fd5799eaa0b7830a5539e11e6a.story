While many people will have their sights set on losing the extra pounds gained over Christmas in 2015, Sportsmail's reporters have an entirely different list of New Year's resolutions.

Instead of letting us in on their personal plans, our experts have revealed what they'd like to see happen in sport over the next 12 months.

From moving the FA Cup semi-finals away from Wembley to tougher laws on drug abuse, here's some interesting ways to improve the sports we love.

MATT BARLOW

The usual wishes: 

1) A little less diving and play-acting from the grown men who still insist on cheating their fellow professionals.

2) More opportunities for British players and coaches at the highest level.

3) Move the FA Cup semi-finals away from Wembley and give them their own day, with no other football.

I'm proud supporters at my club Liverpool are leading the fight against the totally absurd cost of attending football matches - and I truly hope they win. The game is in grave danger of completely losing touch with its working-class base.

Can we stop writing off boxers if they are defeated once? As Oscar De La Hoya says, with half an eye on Floyd Mayweather: 'There is no shame in losing as long as you give it your all. The pity is when the best don't fight each other. Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sugar Ray Leonard and Julio Cesar Chavez were all beaten but are still honoured as all-time greats in the Hall of Fame.'

JONATHAN MCEVOY 

Administrators to get serious about drug abuse in sport. A brilliant start would be to disband or reconfigure the World Anti-Doping Agency – a weedy organisation masquerading as a crusader. Same goes for a number of governing bodies, who are long on lip-service and short on action.

MIKE DICKSON

Tennis needs to get up to speed with modern demands and habits this coming year by making a decisive effort to cut out the amount of dead time in matches. 

Some or all of the following areas need to be addressed and the recent IPTL showed the way: time between points, net cords on serve, spurious toilet breaks, spurious call-ons for the physio, unnecessary warm-ups. 

Separately, I would also like to see more money allocated to drug testing. I am more optimistic on both counts than for some time but will not be holding my breath.

ROB DRAPER 

My one wish for football – Sepp Blatter to stand down as FIFA president followed by a resignation of the entire FIFA executive committee and an invitation to an organisation such as Transparency International to make proposals on how football governance should be restructured. 

FIFA is a corrupt 20th century institution staggering on in the 21st century. The game is sick to its core – but the glitz and glamour is so beguiling we scarcely notice.

PAUL NEWMAN

Let's see an end to nasty, mindless sledging on the pitch in the wake of the Phillip Hughes tragedy. Play hard, yes, and certainly don't hold back on bowling bouncers. But do we need to see so much of the snarling and foul-mouthed abuse which is on the increase in the game, which was even seen in the first Test in Adelaide between Australia and India immediately after the terrible accident involving Hughes. The greatest cricketing theatre comes when a fast bowler stares at a batsman after a bouncer, like Curtly Ambrose used to, not aims mindless abuse at him.

Paul Newman hopes there is no more foul-mouthed abuse on cricket pitches around the world next year

MARCUS TOWNEND 

For the BHA to prune the fixture list. The equation is simple – too many races, too few runners. The result has been a spate of poorly patronised meetings which have particularly blighted jump racing in the final few weeks of the year.

The focus will be on AW Flat meetings in the opening days of the New Year to see how well they are supported. The chances of my wish coming true? On a par with Father Christmas coming down my chimney!

Footballers to stop diving and start acting like grown men would be good

More opportunities for British players and coaches would also be welcome

It is hoped Liverpool fans can win their fight against rising ticket prices
