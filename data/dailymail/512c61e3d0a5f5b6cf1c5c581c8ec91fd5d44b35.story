UEFA's opposition to the Premier League staging fixtures overseas is not likely to change, according to the governing body's general secretary Gianni Infantino.

Plans for a '39th game' to be played as far away as Asia, America and Australia were scrapped in 2008 following widespread opposition, including from FIFA and UEFA.

The issue reared its head again, however, after Premier League clubs' chairmen discussed the proposal at a recent meeting but Infantino believes UEFA's stance will remain the same.

'We already have some associations who play games abroad so it is part of this wish to export national football overseas,' Infantino said at the Leaders in Sport conference in London.

'We have to bear in mind though that there is a pyramid in place and that whenever these kind of things are discussed we have to act in a responsible way within the rules we've all agreed together.

'Let's see what the decision of UEFA is on this. I don't think it will change, it would have to be discussed, but I don't think it will change.'

Any fixtures played overseas would need the approval of the host nation, the relevant confederation and FIFA.

UEFA would only have jurisdiction over a fixture staged outside England if it was played elsewhere in Europe.

Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert insists such a proposal would never get off the ground in Germany and suspects FIFA would have objections too.

'I think it's a creative idea, I'm not sure it would work with FIFA,' Seifert said. ''We have a completely different approach about our idea of German football.

'For the financial side it would be maybe a good idea to play a match all over the world, but for the supporters who are visiting 34 games of that club, no matter if it's snow or rain or wind or whatever and they're travelling.

'And on that game that has the impact that the team is going to be relegated and they cannot be there, because it's in Thailand - I think this would not be an approach for the Bundesliga.'

The Premier League is not alone in looking to hold games abroad.

Italy's Serie A chief confirmed on Tuesday the Italian Super Cup match between Juventus and Napoli will be played in Doha, Qatar on December 22, while the French Super Cup fixture has taken place abroad for the last six years.
