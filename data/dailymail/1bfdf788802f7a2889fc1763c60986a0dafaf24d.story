Two drunken women PCs were arrested after allegedly abusing a train guard who would not let them get a free ride home.

Passengers watched the off-duty pair grapple with the uniformed official on a packed platform at Euston Station, in Central London.

Bystanders said they were waving their warrant cards at him but he refused to let them board the mid-evening service because they were so drunk.

The Midlands-bound train was held up for 10 minutes as officers from British Transport Police (BTP) were called and took the women away.

One witness, a 46-year-old company managing director, said: ‘I was at the barrier getting my ticket checked when two women came along who were completely paralytic.

‘One collapsed on the floor and her friend pulled her up. I could see them flashing their warrant cards and saying they were police officers.

‘The guard said they could not get on and they started screaming and shouting at him. He tried to walk away and they grabbed him by the shoulders and arms and shook him.

‘They grappled with him and stopped him getting away. Everyone watching from the first class carriage could not believe it.

‘Most people thought he was assaulted by members of the public, but I knew they were police officers.

‘It just seems ridiculous that police are so keen on jumping on other people when they are drunk but they cannot behave themselves in such a public place.’

The incident took place on platform one at Euston Station last Wednesday before the departure of the 9.43pm Wolverhampton service.

One of the women, Islington PC Debra Mackrell, 37, of Milton Keynes, was later charged with common assault.

She was commended by her borough commander last year for catching a suicidal woman after she jumped from a window.

Her friend, a 27-year-old PC from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly and has been released on bail.

All Metropolitan Police officers receive free rail travel on London Tube trains and buses whether they are on or off duty.

Officers get free travel to destinations within 70 miles of the capital if they pay the monthly tax liability of either £48 or £96, depending on their salary.

Virgin Trains said the train guard was shaken but not injured by the incident and was able to continue working.

The Metropolitan Police said both officers have been placed on restricted duties away from the frontline.

British Transport Police (BTP) said Mackrell will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday July 20.

Following an adjournment, the CPS have now withdrawn the charges against Ms Mackrell.
