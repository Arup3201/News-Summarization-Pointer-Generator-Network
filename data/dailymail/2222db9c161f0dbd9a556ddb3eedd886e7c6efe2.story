We bargain-hunting Brits are happy to scrimp on staycations and budget for our weekly shop - but when it comes to weddings, we are less skilful at saving our pennies.

According to a new study, the average Brit spends an eye-watering £440 for every wedding we attend - that amounts to an entire week's salary every time someone ties the knot.

And with most of us attending five weddings per year, our matrimonial attendance is costing us a total of £2,180 every year.

Hey big spender: The average Brit spends a whole week's wages being a wedding guest and most attend five a year, which tots up to £2,180!

Not surprisingly, the British women 
surveyed saw their outfit as being the most important part of being a 
wedding guest.

With so many cameras flashing and potential Facebook tags awaiting, it comes as no surprise that a staggering 70 per cent of women choose to spend more on their outfit 
than they do on their accommodation.

Accommodation came in second place when it came to costs, with 61 per cent shelling out over £150 for an evening of celebration.

When it comes to a wedding gift, over half of those generous wedding guests surveyed said they spend over £100 on a present for the happy couple.

The least amount of money gets spent on alcohol, with 44 per cent spending over £50 on tipples on the big day.

Helen North, Head of Marketing for fashion brand Kaleidoscope who commissioned the survey said: 'We all know that weddings are a billion pound industry in the UK, and that they can be a very costly affair for the bride and groom. But what about the guests? 

Splashing the cash: 70 per cent of women choose to spend more on their outfit than accommodation, with the least amount of money being spent on alcohol

'We commissioned this survey as we wanted to reveal the expenditure the average guest faces attending the nuptials of our nearest and dearest.

'The cost of weddings is always considered from the perspective of the bride and groom, but just how much does it cost the guests and where do they see the need to spend money to ensure they are the very best wedding guest.

'It’s wonderful to see from our survey results that despite the current economic climate, it is still important for British men and women to celebrate weddings in style.'
