Campaign: Sir Roger Moore last week called for a boycott of Fortnum & Mason until it stops selling foie gras. Plans to build a foie gras factory farm in China have now been withdrawn

Plans to build a massive foie gras factory farm in China have been withdrawn after a campaign backed by James Bond actor Roger Moore, it was claimed today.

British company Creek Projects Investments was to have funded the £10million project to build one of the world’s biggest facilities producing the liver pate, made by force-feeding ducks and geese.

Animal welfare campaigners said they had received confirmation from China that the construction will not go ahead.

The decision is said to have been taken after months of appeals and petitions in Britain and China.

In April, Creek Projects posted a note on its website saying the foie gras operation had been suspended as a result of 'concerns from the public'.

The company’s directors called for a review 'to include input from animal welfare and environmental experts to address any issues which may or may not exist'.

A spokesperson for Humane Society International (HSI), one of the animal welfare charities involved, said the project was 'definitely not going ahead'.

The facility in China’s Jiangxi Province would have slaughtered eight million ducks and two million geese a year to produce 1,000 tonnes of foie gras.

The news comes a week after Sir Roger, 84, 
who played James Bond in seven movies, accused upmarket department store Fortnum & Mason of 
selling 'torture in a tin' at its London store.

He also claimed the retailer was trying to 'hoodwink' shoppers into believing that foie gras is ethically sourced.

Sir Roger's comments followed an 
investigation by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of
 Animals (PETA), which he said found that some birds were unable to 
stand because they were so 'desperately ill'.

The actor said in a petition letter: 'For years, Fortnum & 
Mason – one of the few remaining shops that still sell the vile product 
foie gras – have been attempting to hoodwink the public into believing 
that the foie gras it sells in its food hall and restaurants is 
"ethical".

'Now, thanks only to PETA, we know that company’s claims are a sham.'

Controversial: Concerns have been raised about foie gras because its production involves force-feeding grain and fat to geese or ducks

The actor said that PETA's film 
showed terrible conditions at farms which supply the company that 
provides foie gras to Fortnum & Mason.

The
 retailer said it would investigate PETA's allegations, but said some of
 the footage was not taken at farms it used as suppliers.

A
 spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'We have instructed the appropriate
 individuals within the business to look into the allegations.'

Making
 the delicacy typically involves force-feeding birds by placing a tube 
down their throats and pumping large amounts of food directly into their
 stomachs. This causes the liver to become enlarged by up to ten times 
its normal size.

Foie gras force-feeding is banned in Britain, but the product is still available from fine food specialists and in restaurants.

The campaign against the factory farm was backed by HSI, Compassion in World Farming, and the RSPCA, among others.

It received strong celebrity support, including from Sir Roger.

HSI said its representatives in China had learned that the Creek Projects facility had been abandoned.

Confirmation came in a radio broadcast on China’s Central People’s Broadcasting Station, quoting a local government official.

Investigation: Fortnum & Mason last week said it maintained 'rigorous quality control procedures'

Mark
 Jones, the charity’s director, said: 'The abandoning of plans to 
construct this massive foie gras production facility in China is a great
 example of animal protection groups across the world using their 
collective reach to challenge animal cruelty.

'The
 forced feeding of birds for foie gras production is illegal in our own 
country, and the British public will not tolerate investments in such 
cruel practices by British companies overseas.'

A
 man answering the phone at a contact number listed on Creek Projects’ 
website, who said he was authorised to handle press inquiries, refused 
to discuss the fate of the foie gras facility. He said: 'Any 
announcements will be made to the market.'

In
 June, campaigners sent a petition letter to local officials in Jianxi 
Province in China, co-signed by a number of organisations and including a
 message from Sir Roger.

Appeals were also sent to the Chinese embassy in London, and the headquarters of Creek Projects Investments in Huntingdon.

Joyce
 D’Silva, ambassador for Compassion in World Farming, said: 'This is a 
triumph for animal welfare and campaigners across the globe. Just as 
cruelty knows no geographical boundaries, neither does compassion and 
concern for the welfare of animals.'

More
 than a dozen countries have banned foie gras production including 
Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, 
Norway, Poland, Turkey and Israel. The practice is also outlawed in 
California and most Austrian provinces.
