In addition to helping the first lady keep track of engagements, field phone calls and interface with fashion designers, Paredes also helped Onassis practice her Spanish in advance of speeches in Latin American countries and before Hispanic communities.

Paredes described his mother as 'a woman of immense will, passion, curiosity and a zest for life.' 

His Facebook profile includes a photo of him as a boy with the Kennedy family at Christmastime. 

Providencia Paredes told Fox News Latino in 2013 she couldn't make the trip to Dallas with the Kennedys in November 1963.

However, she picked the first lady's pink ensemble after receiving a phone call from President Kennedy, in which he requested Paredes select a weather-appropriate outfit for his wife, Fox News Latino reported.

After President Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, Paredes told Fox News Latino the first lady called her with a request for a different ensemble.

'I got a blue outfit and sent it to her right away,' Paredes told the news outlet. 'I had just found out earlier about what happened to the President.'

Upon seeing Onassis at the White House, Paredes told Fox News Latino 'We went into a room, just she and I, and she broke down. She said "They could have killed me too." She said she was very afraid.'

Paredes went on to work for Onassis in New York City before she became Sen. Robert Kennedy's employee, Fox News Latino reported.

She told the news outlet regarding his 1968 assassination 'I was getting dressed [in my Ambassador Hotel room], ready to go down, when I got the news.'

The New York Times reported that Paredes and son Gustavo attended Onassis' burial service.

After she died, Onassis left $50,000 to Paredes, Fox News reported.
