This is the shocking moment fireworks stored in a shed exploded at a wedding reception in Cumbria, killing two people.

Guests at the reception on the shores of Lake Windermere fled in terror when they heard the explosion and saw smoke and fireworks, shortly after the bride and groom had posed for photographs on Saturday afternoon.

Around 70 guests were mingling in the marquee of the countryside wedding venue when there was an ‘enormous explosion’ as fireworks went off in a nearby outbuilding, sparking a huge fire, witnesses said.

Fire rampaged through outbuildings at the wedding reception in Windermere, Cumbria, on Saturday afternoon

The area was evacuated and the celebration had to be cancelled as firemen rushed to the reception, being held at a beauty spot yards from Windermere in Cumbria.

Emergency services later recovered the bodies of a man and a woman. Their identities have not been released.

None of the wedding party guests are thought to be missing, but police refused to confirm whether or not the victims had been working at the event.

Insurance firm boss John Simpson, 61, married Nicole Rothwell, 44, and were holding the reception in the grounds of their lakeside home when the first started at 3.35pm on Saturday.

They are believed to have had a register office ceremony earlier in the week and held the party to celebrate it with family and friends on Saturday.

One of the musicians, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was a beautiful day and we were playing on the terrace just after the photographs were taken.

‘The bride was in her gown in the garden with the groom and the fireworks just started going off. The flaming debris was falling all around.

‘The firework display was spectacular, but we were wondering why it was being held in the bright daylight.

‘Then we realised something shocking had happened. We grabbed our instruments and ran.’

He said ‘everyone was in complete shock’ and the bride was ‘obviously extremely upset.’

Neighbour Enid Battersby said: ‘All of a sudden there was an enormous explosion. I have never heard anything like it since the blitz in Manchester.’

There then followed loud ‘booms and pops’ and thick smoke could be seen.

It is understood there was going to be a big fireworks display later in the evening as the grand finale of the wedding celebration.

Tourist Anthony Middleton was at the nearby Brockhole Visitor Centre with his family when they saw fireworks shooting into the sky.

He said: ‘We heard this almighty explosion and the best way to describe that would be a series of earth-shaking cannons going off. 

'The ground was shaking. We looked up and saw exhibition fireworks illuminating the daytime sky. That was followed by thick grey smoke and we obviously realised there was a fire nearby.

‘Explosions were going off all the time, we could see the fireworks coming out from behind the trees. It appeared to us the fireworks had been stored in this wooden building that was on fire.

‘We realised something disastrous was taking place. I could almost feel the heat of the fire.’

Another witness from the visitor centre said: ‘There was an explosion that sounded like thunder and then lots of fireworks went off. There were clouds of black smoke, we had no idea what happened.’

The national park visitor centre at Brockhole was packed with hundreds of tourists enjoying the last weekend of the summer holidays.

Stuart Halliwell, the manager at the Treetop Trek Woodland Adventures on the site, said one of his staff helped evacuate wedding reception guests away from the fire scene.

He said: ‘It must have been awful for the couple on their special day. It is obviously a tragedy but we could have been even worse than it was.’

The fire was in the grounds of the couple’s home Larch Cottage, at Ecclerigg. A fire service spokesman said four fire engines were sent to the scene to tackle a ‘well developed fire involving the two outbuildings.’

A Cumbria Police spokesman said they were called after a ‘shed containing fireworks was on fire.’ A vehicle nearby was also damaged by the blaze.

‘Two bodies, believed to be a male and a female, were found. Police and the fire service are investigating the circumstances that led to the fire.’

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Brown said: ‘We are still trying to examine the circumstances and the cause of the fire.’

Mr Simpson was a partner in a local insurance company which he co-founded 30 years ago. 

Crime scene investigators were still at the scene yesterday and the bride and groom were not available for comment.
