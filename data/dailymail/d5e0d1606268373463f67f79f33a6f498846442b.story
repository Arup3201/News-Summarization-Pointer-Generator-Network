There's no denying it, the array of Miss Universe costumes being created every year have been a little... well interesting, to say the least.

Known for usually raising a few eyebrows or two, and not always in the good sense, the national costume portion of the competition has always copped plenty of criticism and Aussie creations are no exception.

And so the reason for a different direction, again this year, opting to let the Australian public vote for their favourite design.

The winning design by emerging Victorian designer Caitlin Holstock is a Dream Time sunset-inspired gown, Team Australia, worn by Tegan Martin when she graces the international stage next year.

The 22 year old designer is aware there is some out there that aren't so keen on the design but welcomes the criticism.

'I love to take on criticism for the future, but the truth is you can't please everyone,' she said.

'You have to do your best to produce what everyone likes.'

'I was told by a lady at Channel 10 that my costume was the most popular to the public compared with previous year's, so I'm pretty happy.'

The budding designer who has just graduated with a bachelor of applied science and fashion technology said she was ecstatic after knowing she had won and the Australian public had voted for her design.

'Words cannot describe how I'm feeling, so exciting, such an amazing opportunity.'

Caitlin said she drew her inspiration back to Australia's indigenous heritage, Australia's oldest heritage to create something with earth colours and blue skies.

She also used an indigenous print on the skirt which derived from a King William Barak painting in the 1800s after seeking permission from his brother, an aboriginal elder and close family friend.

Caitlin says in previous years some of the costumes have been a little crazy but has relished the idea that the public has been allowed to vote saying it just shows Aussies are behind the design that won.

The Steve Irwin inspired costume was another finalist by designer Fred Diak

The Dream time design received mixed reactions on social media, despite being voted the best of the finalists

'This looks ridiculous!' said one comment. There was a range of different opinions on the design on social media

'I love the idea, it is about Australia, encapsulating and showing to the world. You want Australia to be behind it,' she said.

'Giving the public the chance to vote just means they are behind the idea, more accepting of it.'

The Miss Universe Australia facebook page has definitely shown some of the mixed reactions to the widely colourful ensemble.

One user made a comment clearly stating here disgust at the design.

'This costume made me spit my coffee all over the tv laughing so hard.. This costume is more suited to Mardi Gras rather than a Miss Universe pagent. Why do we as Australians have to be so tacky when designing these things..??'

Another stated 'No Yuck' while some didn't really understand what the creation was about, saying if she didn't understand, how would the rest of the world.

Another facebook post said it 'looked ridiculous, I wish there was an unlike button.'

Despite some 'haters' the Dream time sunset design by Caitlin Holstock received plenty of support

This facebook user loved the design saying 'it totally represents Australia'

But with all the 'haters' there has been plenty of supporters.

'I liked all of this year's designs. They all looked the part and captured Australia,' wrote one user.

While another labelled it inspiring, another picked it as her own favourite design, 'the huge sunset and aboriginal skirt stood out!'

And while it seems to have topped the list in the voting stakes, a recent poll by the Sydney Morning Herald has shown not all Aussies were so thrilled about the creation.

How do you rate the winning Miss Universe national costume? 60 per cent said 'hate it' while only 40 per cent said 'love it'.

But Caitlin has brushed off some opinions and says it won't be to everyone's taste.

'People have to remember that it's a costume, not a gown, it does have to be out there in order to compete in internationals, it has to be extreme,' she said.

'I researched looks in the past decade of the countries that won and I drew inspiration from there as I wanted to compete on an international level.'

The aspiring fashion designer is also pretty chuffed that Miss Australia herself, Tegan Martin loves the design and can't wait to wear it.

'She loved it, she wanted to be sexy and very Australian, very out there, she loved the idea of the Victoria Secret looking wings.'

While Australia hasn't come close to winning the national costume section in the past, Caitlin is optimistic she's in with a chance.

'I hope it's up there with the top designs, I feel I've given myself a chance from the research.'

And if she had to pick another winner if her design wasn't voted as the top pick, she's still sitting on the fence.

'I could not pick a favourite, voting was really nerve wracking and had such high stands, they were all great,' she said.

The winning costume was chosen by a public vote from four finalists in the competition that was run by Elucent Skincare.

The three other top designs also featured Australian icons like the Sydney Opera House, national flowers and corrugated iron.

Christopher Ditas created the corrugated iron inspired design, a floral draping number with shiny blue material.

While Fred Diak's was ode to Steve Irwin.... crocodile Dundee eat your heart out.  

Tegan Martin will wear the ensemble at the international final in Miami in January.
