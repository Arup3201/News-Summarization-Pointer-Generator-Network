With temperatures currently hovering around 2F (-17C), it's fair to say that it's pretty chilly in Ithaca, New York, right now.

It's so cold, in fact, that the local tourist bureau has issued a hilarious ad on its website urging potential visitors to forgo a trip to the Upstate New York city and head to the Florida Keys instead.

Visitithaca.com added the pop-up window to their website under the banner, 'That's it. We surrender. Winter, you win. Key West anyone?'

The hilarious ad from Ithaca tourist board - complete with a gorgous image of bathers enjoying the azure water in Key West - advises potential visitors to go to sunny Florida until the weather warms up

The ad goes on to say that 'due to this ridiculously stupid weather' visitors should reconsider their travel plans, and to 'come back when things thaw out. Seriously, it's for the birds here now.'

'On behalf of 100 million Northeasterners, we're saying that we're done with cold and snow.'

Speaking to the Ithaca Journal, Bruce Stoff, director of the Ithaca Convention & Visitors Bureau, defended the tongue-in-cheek message: 'This is a way for us to stay engaged with our customers at a time when Upstate New York isn't exactly top of mind.'

But it appears that the reverse psychology tactics may have paid off. The quirky ad has caused a flurry of interest on social media with hundreds of Twitter users commenting and re-tweeting it to their followers.

Twitter was awash with people re-tweeting the ad and praising the tourist board's keen sense of humour

Many Twitter users praised the tourist board for its honesty and sense of humour, while user MikeMongo is among a number of people on the site who claim the amusing ad may actually persuade them to visit the city.

If you are considering a visit once the snow finally thaws and temperatures reach double figures, they're plenty of attractions waiting for potential visitors.

According to the tourist bureau's website, the city is blessed with stunning natural scenery, including abundant waterfalls and gorges. 

If you do get around to visiting Ithaca when it thaws out, there are plenty of attractions to keep visitors happy

'In our corner of the Finger Lakes Region of New York, we've become a destination known for cultural events, activities and outstanding outdoor recreation. 

'Our population is infused with the constant energy of youth from the bright students and faculty of Ithaca College and Cornell University making it a unique and dynamic vacation destination that is charming, intelligent and varied.'

Well, they say no publicity is bad publicity...
