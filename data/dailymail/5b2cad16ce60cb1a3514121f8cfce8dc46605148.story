Referee Jon Moss 'wilted' under pressure from Chelsea players and sent off Gareth Barry, according to Everton captain Phil Jagielka.

The Toffees were  level when Barry received his marching orders for a second yellow card late on for a tackle on Willian following an earlier booking for bringing down Juan Cuadrado. 

Jose Mourinho's men appeared quick to surround Moss and Jagielka believes the referee was influenced to show the red card before Willian scored a last-minute winner for the home side.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Jagielka said: 'I'm not sure the tackle warranted a second yellow but the ref is surrounded by five or six of their players and is put under tremendous pressure and, unfortunately for us, wilted and sent Gaz off.'

Tim Howard replaced Joel Robles in goal after returning to fitness and looked like keeping a clean sheet until Willian's late strike after Chelsea had a goal ruled out just minutes earlier.

'Tim's made some pretty good saves and (Petr) Cech has made a couple as well but you think your luck is in when the deflected goal is ruled out for offside,' explained Jagielka.

'Then there is a mad two or three minutes. Then to compound the misery, the ball deflected two or three times and went in the bottom corner.'
