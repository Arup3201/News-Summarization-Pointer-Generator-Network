A man from Hunan Province in southern China has been imprisoned by his own mother in a chicken shed for an astonishing 13 years, according to the People's Daily Online.

Tang Shuangqiang's mother claimed he suffered from mental problems and was called the 'crazy fighter' by their neighbours.

She said the family was poor and locking him up in the outhouse was the best solution she had.

A resident of the Yang Liu village in Shaoyang City, Mr Tang, 46, started suffering from split personality in 1991 due to various emotional setbacks, including love failures, his mother claimed.

Mr Tang's plight was only discovered when old schoolmate Ms Xiao went to visit him, hoping for a happy reunion after 28 years.

Instead, Ms Xiao was shocked to see that her old friend being chained with rusty shackles in a former chicken shed no larger than six square metres.

The space has no furniture or bed and is filled with hundreds of red plastic bags, which Mr Tang's mother uses to serve him meals.

His mother said her only income is  an annual subsidiary of 3,000 yuan (£323) from the local authority and she cannot afford proper medical care for son.
