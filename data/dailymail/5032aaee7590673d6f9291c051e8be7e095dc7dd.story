Tragic: Little Isabella Mia Tolentino, died of complications from appendicitis in July 2012

A grief-stricken Texan mother is to sue her health insurance provider because she claims they were negligent and too cheap to fly her little girl back home for treatment after she fell ill with appendicitis.

University of Texas Medical nurse Marissett Tolentino is seeking unspecified damages from Blue Cross Blue Shield - blaming them for the tragic death of her six-year-old child Isabella last year while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.

Needing immediate surgery, Tolentino says that the insurance company told her that Isabella's condition was not an emergency and she was forced to undergo an operation on the Caribbean island during which her child fell into a coma from which she never woke up.

The lawsuit was filed last week in a Galveston court last week and alleges that the insurance firm actively worked with the Dominican Republic hospital to keep Marissett Tolentino and her husband in the dark about their daughters condition and hiding paperwork before getting her home.

The Tolentino's allege that the decisions made by Blue Cross Blue Shield cost their daughter her life and that they were kept in the dark about any potential complications.

'Blue Cross Blue Shield was aware of the severity of Isabella's condition, yet they knowingly delayed the process and placed administrative prerequisites above the urgency required to save Isabella's life,' says the lawsuit according to the Houston Chronicle.

A spokesman for the provider said that they would not comment on the pending litigation.

According to the lawsuit, the Tolentino's were wary of traveling to the Caribbean for their vacation but did so knowing the health facilities provided at their resort as well as the nearby hospital were part of their insurance.

'I did my homework," Marissett Tolentino said. 'I was scared to travel out of the country.'

At their resort Isabella began to experience serious abdominal pains on Jul5th and was diagnosed with appendicitis by doctors at Hospiten Bavaro.

'We strongly urged them that we didn't want her to have her surgery in the Dominican Republic,' Tolentino said.

'I was willing to put her on a commercial airplane - that was how scared I was of putting her in surgery over there.'

However, upon consultation with their pediatrician in the United States, Tolentino decided her best mode of action was to ask for a private medical jet - costing $18,000.

This was denied by the insurance company and the Tolentino's were told that appendicitis was not an emergency.

'I just thought, I've been paying all these premiums all these years and then when I really needed them, they wouldn't pay for an $18,000 flight,' Tolentino said.

I have to deal with the daily struggles of losing my child over something so stupid - them flying her home.'

Having allowed against their wishes to have their daughter operated on in the Dominican Republic, under anesthesia, Isabella's breathing tube became clogged with vomit and blood and she fell into a coma.

There were alleged complications with the surgery according to the lawsuit including an intubation tube that was too small for the girl.

Eventually Isabella was transported from the Dominincan Republic to Miami where doctors declared her brain dead from lack of oxygen.

She was taken off life support on July 18.

'The brain is an organ that we don't fully understand,' Tolentino said. 'There are always these miracles - that's what I was hoping for.'
