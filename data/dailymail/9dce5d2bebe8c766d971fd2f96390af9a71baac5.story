Storm-force winds forced this huge 30ft fibreglass storage tank two miles before it crashed into a young family's home.

A terrified mother and three children were in the house when the tank steamrollered over the family's car and into the porch. Thankfully, no one was hurt.

After renovating the property for two years, David and Catriona Soudan had moved into the house just six weeks before the incident, which forced them to move into temporary accommodation while it is repaired.

This fibreglass storage tank rolled two miles in storm-force winds into this family home in Scotland

It is thought the tank was a storage vessel from a distillery which was blown from a distillery in Dhurrie - around two miles from the house, in Campbeltown in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

Mrs Soudan, 41, said: ‘I heard an almighty crash and looked out and thought it was a wind turbine – I was shaking and the children were terrified.’

Mr Soudan, also 41, was at work at the time and his wife couldn’t reach him because of bad phone signal.

The farm manager said: ‘It couldn't have happened at a worse time of year with Christmas around the corner.

‘Catriona and the kids are still pretty shaken by what happened. There was no warning, the tank just came crashing through the porch.’

'Devastated' Mr Soudan said he couldn’t believe what he was seeing when he got home from work.

Mr Soudan added: ‘The porch will need to be totally rebuilt and there are some minor cracks in the main building. The tank has hit it with an amazing force.

‘But, it's only bricks and should be grateful no one was injured. If someone had got in the way of this, they wouldn't have stood a chance.’

Local firm McFadyens Contractors has since broken up the tank and removed it from the Soudans’ property.

Police confirmed they are no longer involved and an insurance investigation is underway to determine exactly what happened.

Mr Soudan said: 'It's even more devastating as we've spent the last two years doing the house up'

David, Catriona and their children Claire, 12, Erin, nine, and Matthew, five, have all taken refuge in a local guest house and fear it could be some time before they are able to move back in.

Mr Soudan added: ‘Someone is coming out to inspect the property but we are hopeful it will be covered. The early indications are we should be okay.

‘At the moment it's not clear what happened. We think the tube was tethered down and broke free, but we aren't totally sure.

‘It's pretty much destroyed the car as well. I don't think anyone is to blame, it's just a freak accident.’

A spokesman for the police confirmed they had attended the incident in the immediate aftermath.

He said: ‘We got a call about the fibreglass tube having been blown by the wind and striking a house.

‘We attended to establish if there were any injuries and upon ascertaining there weren't officers were stood down.’
