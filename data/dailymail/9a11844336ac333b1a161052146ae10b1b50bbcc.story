A Sydney woman is preparing to face court in Kuala Lumpur where her lawyers say she was caught unknowingly carrying drugs.

Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 51, will on Friday face charges of carrying 1.5kg of crystal meth into Malaysia, and a mandatory death sentence if she's convicted.

Her lawyers say the mum from suburban southwest Sydney is a 'naive and innocent mule' who was deceived.

Lawyer Tania Scivetti said her client had not yet come to terms with how grave her predicament is. 'I don't think it has really hit her yet,' she told AAP ahead of the appearance.

Exposto was intercepted while transiting through Kuala Lumpur airport on December 7.

She mistakenly followed the other passengers off her flight from Shanghai and had to return back through customs and immigration to join her planned flight to Melbourne.

There, say customs authorities, she volunteered her bag for scanning.

The ice, worth the equivalent of $A100,000, was found in a stitched secret compartment.

A relative of Mrs Exposto revealed the family's shock at hearing the news she had been arrested.

Joao Noronha said the grandmother is his wife's auntie, and he and his family lived in her Cabramatta West home, in Sydney's south-west, in  for a year with their children.

Mr Noronha refuses to believe Mrs Exposto willingly smuggled any drugs, echoing her lawyer's sentiments that she had fallen into a trap or been otherwise misled.

'It's not like her, the Maria that we have known for more than 20 years is not a drug user and not a drug dealer,' he told Daily Mail Australia from his home in Dili, East Timor earlier this month.

She was travelling on Malaysian Airlines flight 387 when she was arrested last week at Kuala Lumpur airport

Exposto is accused of having 1.5kg of the drug ice in a backpack, an offence that could see her hanged

'I believe that my auntie is just a victim in this case.

'I believe that she does not even know types of drugs at this time like the 'ice',' he continued adding that he had never heard of the methamphetamine either.

Mrs Exposto has a 'nice, quiet' husband and four sons, who Mr Noronha described as 'good boys'.

He described her as 'easy going, very friendly' and someone with many friends who enjoys making jokes. 

The grandmother-of-two stays with Mr Noronha and his wife Ladhy in their East Timor home when she comes to visit, and is very close to their family. 

'Maria is very close to us in Timor, every time she comes to Timor she lives with us.'

The family of Exposto said they don't believe she knowingly tried to smuggle drugs out of Malaysia

On the reports that Mrs Exposto was carrying documents for another man,  her nephew said he knew nothing of that.

'I know nothing about that honestly, and I was surprised that I read the news.'

Mr Noronha reinforced that the woman he knows so well had nothing to do with what she was accused of.

'We worry about the news, we worry about the laws and law enforcement in Malaysia especially in relation to drugs,' he said.

'It makes us worry so much about her, we can only pray and we believe that Maria is not that Maria.' 

The woman, from Cabramatta in Sydney's west, told her lawyers she was not guilty and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  

Defence lawyer Muhammed Shafee Abdullah said Ms Pinto had been 'used by unscrupulous people' and would likely be able to prove she was not guilty of the charge.

Mr Noronha also said he doesn't think the grandmother even knows what the methamphetamine 'ice' is

The woman, from Liverpool in Sydney's west, told her lawyers that she was innocent and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs

'There is a very strong chance that she is one of those naive and innocent mules that has been used by some unscrupulous people,' he told reporters at the court.   

After her appearance at a Kuala Lumpur court earlier this month, Mr Shafee told reporters Ms Pinto was told by the soldier that he needed documents inside the bag to be taken to Melbourne in order to organise his discharge.

Ms Exposto's children said they have been concerned about their mother.

'We all love our mum,' the family told the Nine Network. 'We are all worried for her and all praying for the best.'

The mother - who could face the death penalty - was told she would then hand over the bag to another person at Melbourne airport. 

But before Ms Pinto was able to board the next leg of her flight, she was stopped by airport customs while she was en route to the Victorian capital from Shanghai.

Customs director Chik Omar Chik Lim said the Liverpool woman was about to board about 5pm when the scanner picked up the methamphetamines 'wrapped in plastic and stashed inside a secret compartment in her travel bag'.

She was then questioned by police about the drugs that were detected, which are worth $93,000 in Malaysia.

Since 1960, more than 440 people have been hanged in the south-east Asian country.

The mother, 51, said she was carrying the bag on behalf of a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan who told her she was going to pass it on to someone at Melbourne airport (above)

Hanging is inevitable for people who are found guilty of smuggling more than 50 grams of methamphetamines.   

The arrest follows the release of 22-year-old Australian Kalynda Davis who was arrested in China on drug smuggling charges earlier in December.

Ms Davis faced execution by firing squad along with New Zealander Peter Gardner for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Australia from China.

While Miss Davis returned home to Sydney earlier this week, Mr Gardner remains in Chinese custody.
