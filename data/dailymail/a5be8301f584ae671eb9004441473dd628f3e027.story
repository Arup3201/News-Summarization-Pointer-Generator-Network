The heartbreaking video shows Andrew Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail

The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said.

'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives.

'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.'

On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java.

Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day. 

Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby.

Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling

Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance?

'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.'

Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars.

At the same time, Sukuraman - under the tutelage of Ben Quilty - has become an artist, even teaching inmates how to paint.

This turnaround in the pair has led many to believe they have been rehabilitated. 

Sunday Night also revealed fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman knew the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the group - but did not want to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family.

Sukuraman told the news program he had tried to trade this information to avoid the death penalty, but Indonesian police refused the offer.

'We tried with the police to get some sort of co-operation thing but there weren't really like that was our only card that we had to play,' he said.

'They wouldn't and then the lawyers advised us not to go that way.'

While Chan said he did not know the identity of the mystery ringleader.

Sukuraman also admitted he had thought about hanging himself or getting someone else to shoot him.

'I don't really think I'll enjoy the process of being dragged in front of a firing squad,' he said.

The pair are being held on Nusakambangan where inmates are held before they executed

The duo have been on Nusakambangan since Wednesday.

The pair were transferred just after 5am in heavily armoured vehicles to Denpasar airport, where they flew to Cilacap - the port nearest to Nusakambangan - where they were ferried over to the island.

Their executions have been delayed indefinitely as a number of inmates await the outcome of court proceedings.

Chan and Sukuraman's second challenge for clemency was rejected in January but their lawyers hope Thursday's hearing in a Jakarta court.

This latest action hopes to see the president reconsider their execution as Joko Widodo did not have documents charting the pair's rehabilitation in prison, according their lawyers.
