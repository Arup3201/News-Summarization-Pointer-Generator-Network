Maps showing the loneliest places in the UK are to be created in a bid to tackle the 'fastest growing health problem' in Britain today.

Hundreds of thousands of elderly people across the country live out their lives in almost complete isolation - many of whom admit the only person they regularly speak to is 'the boy in the shop when I pick up my paper', according to recent research.

Experts say that loneliness 
increases the risk of heart disease, puts people at greater risk of 
blood clots and dementia, makes sufferers less likely to exercise and more 
likely to drink more.

Alone: One in five elderly people is in contact with family, friends and neighbours less than once a week, and 11 per cent see them less than once a month

One in five elderly people is in contact 
with family, friends and neighbours less than once a week, and 11 per 
cent see them less than once a month.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is launching the initiative, claims the move will lead to better care for people feeling social isolation and he will ask local authorities to identify areas where older people suffer most acutely from loneliness.

Mr Hunt said: 'Tackling loneliness, by
giving people better care and improved services, is another step 
towards making the UK one of the best places to live in Europe for older
people.

'We need a measure of loneliness to shine a light on this problem and to know what we are dealing with.

Incapacitating: Esther Rantzen, who chairs The Silver Line, a helpline and befriending service for over-65s, said loneliness can make the front door 'feel like a brick wall'

'Once
we have this solid evidence, local communities will have new tools to 
come up with the right, targeted solutions to the problem.'

Mr Hunt is also announcing a £20 million fund to help older people stay warm over the winter months.

Council projects to help vulnerable people keep warm will receive a share of the money.

Esther Rantzen, who chairs The Silver
Line, a helpline and befriending service for over-65s, told The Times: 
'Loneliness creates a loss of confidence, an erosion of self-esteem, so 
that the front door becomes as solid as a brick wall and as impossible 
to break through.'

A report published by think tank Demos earlier this year found that Britain's elderly are lonelier than other similar European countries.

The researchers looked at the general
standards of living of the over-65s in Britain, the Netherlands, 
Germany and Sweden, and found a third of British pensioners did not see 
their close family or friends even once a month for a drink or meal.

And
last year a similar study by the Centre for Social Justice found that 
370,000 of Britain’s elderly spent no time with other people.

Some
pensioners in the research admitted the only person they regularly 
spoke to was ‘the boy in the shop when I pick up my paper’.

elderly get a poorer deal in Britain than in similar European countries, a damning report has found.

They are more likely to suffer ageism in health care and in their daily lives than in either Germany, Sweden or the Netherlands.

They are also far lonelier, with many going weeks without seeing family and friends.
