Music industry giants have won a record $6.6m payout from an internet entrepreneur whose website published song lyrics without permission.

The copyright infringement lawsuit was brought by companies including Warner/Chappell Music, Peermusic and Bug Music against MySpace co-founder Brad Greenspan's LiveUniverse.com.

A district court in California awarded $12,500 in damages for each of the 528 songs listed in the case - which included China Girl by David Bowie and Van Morrison's Moondance.

Licence: LiveUniverse.com published song lyrics without permission

The unlicensed website was taken down at the end of 2010.

The music publishers were represented by Arent Fox, which argued that the companies were starting to see 'real revenue' from online businesses that have obtained licences.

Solicitor Ross Charap told technology website Ars Technica: 'This is an important new stream of revenue for publishers.

'They got nothing from it five or six years ago, and now they get tens of millions of dollars.'

He added that the lawsuit was also aimed at persuading companies not to advertise on unlicensed sites.

Charap said a typical licence for a 
lyrics website involved around 50 per cent of revenue being paid to 
music publishers and songwriters.

He
continued: 'These sites are making hundreds of thousands, if not 
millions of dollars a year, on the backs of people who write this music 
and own this music.'

Greenspan
- who owned a significant chunk of MySpace when it was was sold to News
Corp. in 2005 for $580 million - was also ordered by the Los 
Angeles court to pay the plaintiffs' legal costs.
