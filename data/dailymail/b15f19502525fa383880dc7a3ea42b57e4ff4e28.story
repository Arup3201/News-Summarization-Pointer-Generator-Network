An 'incredibly unusual' fossil fish with fins behind its anus could have implications for human evolution, researchers say.

Dr Robert Sansom at The University of Manchester identified the paired fins of Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago.

They say the unusual positioning of the fins show an important evolutionary shift.

The Euphanerops fish were 3.9 inches (10 centimeters) long and looked somewhat like modern-day eels.

The specimens in the latest study were unearthed in a fossil bed in Miguasha, Quebec, decades ago, and were stored in collections in the Natural History Museum in London and the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Miguasha, in Quebec.

'Euphanerops is unique because its anal fin is paired meaning there is one fin on each side of the fish,' said Dr Sansom.

'Up until now anal fins have only been seen on jawed fish where they are unpaired and this is true of both extinct and modern fish.

'The age of Euphanerops is important as it dates from the time of a deep evolutionary split between jawed and jawless fish, the two main divisions of vertebrates alive today. '

As such, it represents an important stage in the evolution of paired appendages.'

Dr Sansom came across the paired fins as part of a study of Euphanerops fossils in Quebec, Canada.

3D surface scans of fossils and 
comparison of specimens preserved in different conditions revealed that 
there were two fan-shaped fins, a left and a right.

'It’s not clear why the fins are positioned so far back on the fish, or what advantage they might have provided.

'However, they do show that our early vertebrate ancestors tried out lots of different body plans before settling on two arms and two legs.

'If they hadn’t then our bodies would have looked very different!'

Dr Sansom’s research on the paired fins followed on from a 2009 study of early vertebrate evolution and fossil preservation with colleagues from The University of Leicester.

Their findings have been published in the Royal Society’s journal Biology Letters.

Dr Sansom says it was an exciting find: 'The unusual paired anal fin of Euphanerops lends support to the idea that there was some degree of developmental and evolutionary experimentation in some fish.

'After the Devonian period and the extinction of a lot of species, the jawed vertebrate body exhibits fewer deviations from the formula of paired pectoral, paired pelvic, unpaired dorsal and unpaired anal appendages.

'The discovery of new anatomical conditions will hopefully shed more light on the timing and sequence of the events underlying the origin and diversification of vertebrate appendages.'
