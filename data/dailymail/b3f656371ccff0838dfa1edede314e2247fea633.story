Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward will have two special arrivals to contend with during the January transfer window. 

Woodward’s wife Isobel is expecting twins that month but Ed says it will be business as usual. 

Woodward received a lot of stick for his first transfer window in overall charge of Old Trafford in August 2013 when David Moyes had just joined as manager.

Channel 4’s sports chief Jamie Aitchison is surprisingly leaving the station to join London media agency Aurora, set up two years ago, in the newly created role of commercial and development director. 

C4 insist Aitchison, who has overseen the station’s botched revamp of their racing coverage and was responsible for the hapless Ortis Deley fronting the 2011 athletics World Championships, is leaving by choice rather than being pushed.

It is understood that Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey and Manchester United’s Adnan Januzaj will be the two big boot signings when kit suppliers Warrior rebrand as New Balance, the American parent company. 

Ramsey, whose adidas deal has expired, has been photographed wearing an all-white shoe that could be a prototype for New Balance’s entry into the football boot market.

Qatar, who have told FIFA they will stage the 2022 World Cup whenever required, seem to be leaning towards a winter tournament. 

The Qataris’ presentation to a FIFA task force stressed the advantages to tourism in the Middle East of a World Cup in November and December, when training camps could be held in neighbouring countries. 

The Professional Game Match Officials’ strange protocol, which saw Mark Clattenburg dropped for one game for not leaving a match in the official transport, does allow Chris Foy and other officials to be dropped off at Tube stations after London matches. 

The PGMO, who are under extra scrutiny following the Clattenburg fuss, will not comment on the ‘injury’ that has kept assistant referee John Flynn off the match list since last March.

It’s understood Flynn was sidelined after a five-a-side training incident with an elite referee that led to blows.

William Hill, one of the FA’s major sponsorship partners, produce a crass survey asking punters to decide the football effigy they would most like to burn on a bonfire.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter was the first choice, followed by Adrian Chiles, in a poll that was taken despite the FA having investigated alleged racist chanting about the Ferdinand brothers by England fans during the World Cup qualifier against San Marino last year. They were heard singing: ‘Build a bonfire, then burn the f****** lot.’
