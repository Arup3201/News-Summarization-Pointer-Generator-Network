An exhausted – and soaked - owl takes a breather on a canoe’s deck after it was rescued from a freezing Finnish lake by a local adventurer.

The Northern Hawk Owl was found in the cold waters of Lake Tuusula, just north of Helsinki.

Once the owl had been transported ashore and dried off, it was able to fly off to the safety of the forest.

Northern Hawk Owl, or Surnia ulula, differs from a majority of owls as it is not nocturnal, i.e. it is active during the day.

Like many owls, it feeds on small rodents and mammals as well as other birds.

Its name hails from a similarity in appearance and behaviour to hawks and can be found in North America and across Siberia and northern Scandinavia.

Lucky bird: Canoeist Pentti Taskinen found the owl floating in the water and rescued it from a sure death in the icy temperatures

Phew: Once safely ashore, the owl was dried off and returned to the forest
