The second public housing property with Sydney harbour views to be sold has gone under the hammer for $2.56 million, more than $1 million over its reserve.

The five-bedroom Colonial Regency style townhouse at 29 Lower Forte Street at Millers Point, in Sydney's CBD, was last sold over a century ago, and has been used as cheap public housing.

The sale was significantly larger than expected, with buyers given an estimate $1.5 million selling price earlier this month, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Real estate agents Di Jones were unable to comment on the sale of the property, with the Government Property NSW placing a gag order on all agents involved.

The sale is the second of 293 state-owned houses to go under the hammer in a government plan to relocate 600 public housing tenants.

Government Property NSW has now made $4.47 million from the project.

The government has justified the plan by promising that for every house sold in Millers Point, three houses could be built in more suburban Sydney areas, where there is a 58,000-strong waiting list.

But the mass relocation been vastly unpopular with residents and the broader community alike.

Several protesters attended the auction for the Kent St property last week, despite being held in a secret location.

It's expected the impending sales will attract similar resistance.
