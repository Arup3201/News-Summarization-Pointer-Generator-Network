A Missouri judge has decided who will get custody of the orphaned daughter of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher six months after the NFL star killed the child's mother before taking his own life.

Jackson County Probate Commissioner Daniel Wheeler issued an order Thursday granting custody of 9-month-old Zoey Perkins to her cousin Sophie Perkins, of Pflugerville, Texas, saying she was more suited than Belcher's mother to be the baby's guardian.

Zoey lost both her parents on the morning of December 1, 2012, when her father, Belcher, fatally shot her mother, Kasandra Perkins, in the couple's Kansas City home.

The football player then drove to 
Arrowhead Stadium and killed himself in front of coaches and the team's 
general manager as they pleaded with him to put the gun down.

During a three-day hearing last week, 
Sophie Perkins, 35, and Belcher's mother, 54-year-old Cheryl Shepherd of
West Babylon, New York, each argued that she would be the best guardian
for the girl.

Perkins' lawyers attacked Shepherd's 
smoking habit and the number of police calls to her home over the years,
while Shepherd's attorneys criticized Perkins for putting the girl in 
day care 45 hours a week while she worked.

Perkins, who was Kasandra Perkins' 
first cousin, is the sister of Whitney Golden Charles, whose husband is 
Chiefs All-Pro running back Jamaal Charles.

The Kansas City Star reported that she graduated from Texas 
Tech University in 1999 and has worked for Dell Computer for 13 years.

‘Out of these bad circumstances, this 
was the best result for Zoey,’ said Mark Roberts, Perkins' attorney. 
‘Both sides love Zoey; both sides were operating with her best interest 
in mind. The court had a difficult decision to make, but we think it was
the right decision.’

Other than some trips to New York to 
spend time with Shepherd, Zoey has mostly stayed with Perkins in Texas 
since the shooting. The time the girl spent bonding with Perkins played a
role in Wheeler's decision, he wrote, as did the police calls to 
Shepherd's home.

‘There have been numerous police reports made from Ms. Cheryl Shepherd's home during the past twenty years,’ wrote Wheeler.

‘While not controlling, and while not 
making Ms. Shepherd's home inappropriate to raise Minor, the Court 
concludes that this is evidence of Ms. Sophie Perkins' home being more 
stable than Ms. Shepherd's home, and this favors the appointment of Ms. 
Perkins as guardian.’

Zoey is to receive more than $1million
under the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, including $108,000 
annually over the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and $52,000
each year until she turns 18. She will continue to receive that amount 
until she turns 23 if she attends college.

Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players

The girl’s total inheritance has been estimated at $3million, including $1.2million from a life insurance policy.

A trust funded with money from the Chiefs owners, coaches, players, employees and the public will also help care for the child.

Commerce Trust Co. has been appointed as conservator of Zoey's estate and will handle her finances.

Cheryl Shepherd's family previously had been granted 'temporary guardianship' of Zoey, but legal experts said in January that the agreement severely damaged Shepherd's chance of winning back custody of her granddaughter.

Zoey was orphaned on Dec. 1 when her father killed her mother, Kasandra Perkins, at the couple’s home in suburban Kansas City.

Belcher's mother had 
been living with the couple for about two weeks and was in the home when
her son killed Perkins before taking his own life at the Chief's Arrowhead Stadium.

Ms Shepherd received temporary custody 
of Belcher's daughter soon after the shootings and filed a 
petition in mid-December asking to be appointed as Zoey's guardian and 
conservator of her estate, which is worth about $3million.

In January, judges in Texas and Missouri determined that the custody dispute would be handled in Missouri’s Jackson County, where the baby was living at the time of her parents’ deaths and where her paternal grandmother filed a custody petition.

In addition to the well-being of the child, millions of dollars are at stake in the custody battle.

A trust funded by the Hunt family, 
which owns the Chiefs, along with team coaches, players, employees and 
contributions from the public, will help care for the child.

Also, Belcher's beneficiary will 
receive $600,000 in life insurance, plus $200,000 for each credited 
season – Belcher was in his fourth season at the time of his death – and
$100,000 in a retirement account.

Zoey's maternal grandparents, Rebecca
Anne Gonzalez and Darryl Perkins, and other Texas relatives have filed a
lawsuit seeking temporary custody of the girl, that her residence be in
Tarrant County, Texas, and that a guardian ad litem be appointed.

The other woman: Brittni Glass spent the night with Belcher before he murdered his girlfriend but has since denied the two had a sexual relationship

It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a fight about whether or not Belcher was Zoey's father.

His suicide was witnessed by coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli.

A source told the New York Post:
'[Cheryl] believed that there was an issue over whether [Belcher] was
the father. She said he believed he wasn’t necessarily the father of 
the child.'

A Kansas City law-enforcement source confirmed: 'She told police there was a question about the paternity.'

The
source added: 'The implication was that paternity was what the two of 
them were fighting about — that the baby might not have been his.'

The couple had been receiving counseling for relationship and financial problems, police said.

A spokeswoman said she would not comment on the doubts raised over baby Zoey's paternity.

It also emerged last month that the NFL player 
had a secret girlfriend - Brittni Glass - who he allegedly told he would shoot Perkins 'if
she didn't leave him alone'.

Belcher is also believed to have had 
drinks and dinner with her before he arrived home, shot his 
girlfriend after a blazing row, and then ended his own life.

Details of the Belcher case are contained in police reports submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor, who has ruled the event a murder-suicide. They include dozens of interviews with witnesses.

Glass has denied the two were in a relationship.

Glass, also 22, told police that Belcher complained about Perkins threatening to take all his money and the baby if they broke up.

He said Perkins 'knew exactly how to press his buttons and make him angry,' according to a summary of the woman's interview with police.

Belcher had been with the woman and some of her friends at a downtown Kansas City entertainment district the night before the shooting, the woman said.

He spent part of the night in her apartment and part of it sleeping in his car before going home early in the morning, the report said.

He and Perkins were arguing before he shot her, his mother, Cheryl Shepherd, told police. Shepherd had moved in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. Shepherd heard Belcher say 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a thump and gunshots.

Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police.

Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said.

Belcher drove off in his Bentley to 
the practice facility at Arrowhead several miles away, where he pulled 
into the parking lot and saw Pioli, the report said.

Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I 
did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a handgun to his own head. 'I got to
go, can't be here, and take care of my daughter,' Pioli recalled 
Belcher saying.

He had asked to speak with Crennel 
and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the report said. Crennel told police he
pleaded with Belcher to put down the gun. One witness said she heard 
Crennel say, 'you're taking the easy way out'.

Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the gun into his temple, the report said.
