Drunken sailor: Don Earl pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding Kenneth Cook

A drunk sailor who kicked a shipmate three times in the head after his victim complained about his 'awful' jokes has been spared jail.

Don Earl, 48, kicked Kenneth Cook, also 48, once square in the face and twice more in the head, while the two were working as civilian merchant sailors on a vessel in the fleet which supports the Royal Navy.

Mr Cook lost a tooth, suffered a deep cut to his nose and was left with a black eye, while Earl was so drunk he was left with no memory of the attack.

Earl was given a 10-month suspended sentence at 200 hours of unpaid work at Southwark Crown Court today, and wept in the dock as the judgement was handed down for his 'stupid, stupid' actions.

The attack took place in July last year, at a time when the two men were working aboard Fort Rosalie, a ship in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, which was stationed in Bermuda.

Both men were working as stores assistants in the supply and transport office of the naval department on board the vessel, which was described by the prosecution as a 'pressure cooker' environment.

The court heard that tensions had been brewing between the two for 'a considerable period of time' on board the vessel, and that many other shipmates in fact found Earl 'annoying'.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner told the court: 'Mr Cook and Mr Earl were both employed by the Ministry of Defence as civilian seamen on Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship, Fort Rosalie.

'Both men were working as stores assistants in the supply and transport office of the naval department on board the vessel.

‘There was a personality clash due to being in a confined space and they took a dislike to each other.'

‘It seems the victim was sitting on a jetty on a raised curb when he was approached on his blind side by Mr Earl.

‘He then kicked him full force in the face, before that was followed by a second and third kick in the head.’

The Court was told that Mr Cook's injuries would have been much worse had Earl not been wearing soft canvas shoes at the time.

Earl has since been sacked and was arrested on his return to Britain. He pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding.

He told police he had been provoked by Mr Cook for a ‘considerable period of time’ but couldn’t remember the attack due to being intoxicated.

In a statement, Mr Cook said: ‘When Don Earl first joined Fort Rosalie, we got on OK but as time progress he started to annoy me because he was so loud and he used to tell awful jokes.

‘He just got on everyone’s nerves, including mine.

‘As time went on, I didn’t like him and he didn’t like me.’

Earl has found himself in severe financial difficulties as a result of the brawl, which also contributed to the breakdown of his marriage.

Sentencing Earl to 10 months in prison, suspended for a year, and 200 hours unpaid work, Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘I want to make it absolutely plain that nothing I say to you should be taken to be a criticism of Mr Cook in the sense that he was asking for it or deserved what happened to him.

‘You used a weapon - your foot with a shoe on it - and that’s the equivalent of a weapon.

‘The fact that you had been taking drink when you did this explains it but does not excuse it, on the contrary it makes it worse.

‘But there is another side to this and there are many indications suggesting that you are a man of positive good character.

‘I accept that there was a background between you and Mr Cook.

‘I recognise that it was a stupid, stupid moment of loss of control on your part.

‘You attacked him and you must take responsibility for it, but the loss of your job has punished you to some extent already.’

Robert Newbould, defending Earl, told how he had an ‘antagonistic’ relationship with Mr Cook, adding that his actions were ‘very much out of character’.

‘The two men were on the same vessel, it’s the same working and living quarters and from Mr Earl’s point of view, there was no means of escape from what he felt was on-going torment.

‘His pride was dented by numerous comments being bandied about.

‘He makes no secret of the fact he can’t remember the incident but he accepts the witness’ account and he is absolutely dismayed by his behaviour.

‘There is no getting away from the fact this has had a significant impact on his personal circumstances.'
