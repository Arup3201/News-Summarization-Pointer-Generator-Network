A French woman has been convicted by jurors in Dallas, Texas, of holding her son under water in a bathtub until he drowned.

Chloe Menager, 27, pleaded guilty to killing one-year-old Elijahu Perez and now faces up to life in prison.

In September 2012, the child's father Pablo Perez flagged down officers for help and they followed him to the couple’s home where they found the child's body.

Chloe Menager, 27, has been convicted by jurors in Dallas, Texas, of holding her son, one-year-old Elijahu Perez, under water in a bathtub until he drowned in September 2012

Court records show that when police arrived, Menager was in wet, bloodstained clothes, ‘talking on the cellphone, crying and screaming, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, my baby.’”

Elijahu was found dead and still wet on a bed inside the apartment. Records show that she told Dallas Fire-Rescue personnel ‘that she killed her baby.’ 

She told police that she held Elijahu underwater in the bathtub. She also tried to kill herself by slashing her left wrist with a dull knife.

In a jailhouse interview shortly after her arrest, she gave religiously critic interviews to FOX4 and the Dallas Morning News in which she spoke of how she was tormented by ‘demons’ and that she had been depressed. Although she stopped short of saying they made her kill her child.

‘I was a good mother,’ she told FOX4. ‘But they don’t see it that way.’

Neither prosecutors or defense attorneys made opening statements or closing arguments. There was no testimony.

Menager moved to Dallas from France 12 years ago, and she said she met her husband three years ago before the death of her son when she saw him play guitar in a band.

Along with her husband, Menager had been attending a small Messianic Jewish Church in Oak Cliff, Am-Segulah Linaje Escogido. (The name is a mixture of Hebrew and Spanish, meaning, roughly, ‘Treasured Nation Chosen Lineage.’)
