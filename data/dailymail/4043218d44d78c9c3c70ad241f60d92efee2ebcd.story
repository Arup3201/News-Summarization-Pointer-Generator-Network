England finished third in the opening round of the HSBC Sevens World Series on the Gold Coast after losing to eventual winners Fiji in the semi-finals.

Simon Amor's men began the final day with a stunning 31-7 rout of defending champions New Zealand, with captain Phil Burgess scoring two tries and others coming from Alex Gray, Christian Lewis-Pratt and Dan Norton.

It was England's biggest win over the All Blacks since 2003 and set up a semi-final meeting with Ben Ryan's Fiji.

Fiji took just 30 seconds to open the scoring but England bounced back immediately, with Dan Bibby making the initial break for Lewis-Pratt to race away and level the scores.

However, that was as good as it got for England as the Pacific Islanders ran in three unanswered tries, two from Osea Kolinisau and one from Jerry Tuwai, to lead 26-7 at half-time.

England began the second half with plenty of possession in the middle of the park but Fiji struck in quick succession through Savenaca Rawaca and Isake Katonibau to stretch their lead before Apisai Naqalevu and Apisalome Waqatabu added others late on as Fiji ran out 48-7 winners.

Fiji went on to beat Samoa 31-24 in the final while England recovered to gain a 19-0 win over South African in the third-place play-off, with Norton scoring two tries to take his world series career tally to 170.

Amor said: 'They team played a really good game against New Zealand and I was really pleased for them.

'The team had fought hard on day one and they responded well today. The way Fiji played with their off-loading game it was so difficult to beat which was disappointing.

'But mentally for the team to pick themselves back up and to beat a very good South African side, it showed a lot about the mental toughness of the group, so overall I am pleased.'
