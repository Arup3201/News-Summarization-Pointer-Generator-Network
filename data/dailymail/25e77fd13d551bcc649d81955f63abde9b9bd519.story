Police are searching for a woman who allegedly tried to abduct a baby in a stroller from his nanny in Manhattan Thursday afternoon.

The NYPD has identified the woman as Tara Anne McDonald, 46, who has several prior arrests for similar crimes.

Police say the nanny was pushing the eight-month-old baby boy in a stroller down Eighth Avenue near 17th Street in the Chelsea neighborhood when she was approached by McDonald.

McDonald reportedly began mumbling at the nanny and then tried to pull the stroller away from her. McDOnald acted as though the baby was hers, witnesses said, screaming and yelling at the nanny to give her the baby.

A UPS driver, William Marte, witnessed the ensuing struggle and ran to the aid of the nanny.

'She grabbed the stroller by the handle, and without no reason, starts saying "Give me my baby,"' Marte told ABC. 'I told the lady, "Leave her alone, get off, are you out of your mind?"'

McDonald eventually fled the scene, disappearing south on Eighth Avenue.

The baby, said Marte, was unhurt in the struggle and slept through the entire ordeal.

Police have released a photograph of the suspect and say she has 12 prior arrests for similar crimes. She served more than a year in prison for an attempted kidnapping in 1998.

Other charges include five attempted kidnappings, two actual kidnappings, robbery, disorderly conduct, felony asault, petit larceny and DWI, reports CBS.

On Friday afternoon, police distributed flyers of McDonald's mugshot around Chelsea.

Some locals recognized her from the shot.

'She's a local crazy. I seen her on the corner here a couple of times, not recently but maybe a month ago,' Chelsea worker Yancy Matson told ABC.

Tara Anne McDonald is described as about five-foot eight-inches tall with salt-and-pepper hair. She was wearing blue jeans and a beige hat and coat.
