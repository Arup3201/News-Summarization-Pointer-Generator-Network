Their golden arches have become a familiar sight on Britain's high streets.

But now it seems that even McDonald's is losing faith in the ability to make money from French fries and burgers in some places.

The fast-food chain has closed its only store in Rochdale town centre after trading there for 28 years.

The recession-hit part of Lancashire is now among the few major towns without a McDonalds.

Deprived: Rochdale town centre has seen a string of big-name stores leave the area after the credit crunch in 2009 caused revenue to fall

The move has been seen as the 'death knell' for the high street, which has struggled after the credit crunch in 2009.

Just 11 months ago both Arcadia's Dorothy Perkins store and Burton  pulled out of the once-thriving Yorkshire Street in the town centre.

Some have seen McDonald's withdrawal as a worrying barometer for retail nationwide, with Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green announcing this week that 260 of his stores are at risk of closure.

McDonalds is the latest in a string of high-profile causalities in Rochdale. TJ Hughes pulled out of the town's Whetsheaf shopping centre two months ago.

While the building next to the former McDonald's store had been occupied by the Body Shop but they left last year. Clothing chain Ethel Austin and Littlewoods have also closed.

The town has been the third worst-hit town in the wake of the recession and 29 per cent of its buildings in the town centre stand empty.

Charity shops, pawn brokers and discount stores such as Poundland have moved into some of the empty units. But residents still believe the area is becoming a 'ghost town'.

Iconic: The 'golden arches' of a McDonald's are recognised globally

Rochdale is the 29th most deprived authority out of 326 in England with 7,741 people - almost six per cent of its population - on jobseeker's allowance.

'When even Ronald McDonald's no longer believes there's a cat in hell's chance of making a fast buck from burgers and Coke here, know that Rochdale Town Centre is finished,' resident  Abbie Hoffman wrote online.

The council have made some attempts to regenerate the region with a planned tram link to Manchester and Oldham.

'That's supposed to bring people in. I'd say it makes it easier for them to leave,' former bus driver Anthony Smith, 65, told the Guardian. 'It's a dump.'

Wife Liz, 59, added: 'Here it's just charity shops and pound shops.'

Another pensioner agreed, saying she now goes elswhere to do her shopping.

Andy Zuntz, the council's executive director, said that new libraries and retail units could encourage rejuvenation.

But it is unlikely to tempt McDonald's back to the town centre where some shopkeepers compain that footfall and turnover have plummeted over the last 12 months.

A McDonald's spokesman said that it has closed three other restaurants in Hemel Hempstead, Kirkcaldy and Bridlington.

They said that the chain still has two outlets in Rochdale based in out-of-town retail parks and has opened nine others nationwide.

'The high street environment continues to change and opening, closing or relocation restaurants enables us to take an integrated, focused and strategic approach to future growth.'
