It was meant to be a Diamond Jubilee celebration for the Queen who has been on the throne for 60 years, but one guest turned up with their own version of a regal tiara on.

Model Lily Cole, arrived at the Royal Academy of Arts in central London, wearing a striking deep blue silk dress and a silver sparking tiara.

Hundreds of celebrities from the worlds of music, dance and art gathered to pay tribute to the Queen.

Bono, Joan Collins and Sir Paul McCartney led the praise as she attended a Diamond Jubilee celebration of the arts.

Sir Paul, who attended with his wife Nancy Shevell, declared that he was a 'huge fan' of the Queen.

The former Beatle said: 'It is always wonderful meeting her, she's great.

'It is always a great pleasure meeting her, I'm a big fan.'

Addressing the Queen, Bono said: 'I wanted to take this opportunity to acknowledge the extraordinary magic that you made on your trip to Ireland last year.'

He joked: 'And the Queen spoke Gaelic, I can't even speak Gaelic.'

In another room the Queen met Dame Shirley Bassey and Joan Collins.

As Hollywood royalty, Joan Collins is not used to having to bow down to anyone.

So it’s little wonder that the usually poised Joan Collins looked uncharacteristically awkward as she attempted to curtsey to the Queen last night.

The actress, who was celebrating her 79th birthday spoke to the Queen next to her Dynasty co-star Kate O’Mara, who wore an elegant purple gown.

Fortunately, Mrs Collins didn’t falter when it came to her sense of style, appearing as glamorous as ever in a pale ruched dress with matching heels.

Celebrations: The event was just one of a series of engagements the Queen is attending to mark her 60 years on the throne

'There will never be anyone like her again.

'I always want to know what she keeps in the handbag.'

The Queen also met singer Jamie Cullum and his wife Sophie Dahl - the pair both arrived in black outfits.

Actor Michael Sheen, a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, spoke to the Queen.

He said: 'I told her that I'm really having a surreal day today because I spent all day training for the Soccer Aid match. On that I'm captain for the Rest of The World team so I have been with all the ex-pro footballers today and now I've come here with all the artists, so I've basically covered all bases.

'She wished me luck and hoped I survive the match which is basically my thoughts as well.'

As the Queen toured the gallery she spotted a landscape painting by her niece Lady Sarah Chatto.

'I know where it is at least,' she said pointing at the picture.

Afterwards she met Downton Abbey actress Penelope Wilton and told her about the piece of art.
