The eurozone will unravel unless its leaders agree to 'shell out' to Greece, Boris Johnson said last night.

The London Mayor, speaking during a tour of the US, risked undermining efforts to persuade Athens to make concessions – insisting it was in a 'strong position'.

'They will shell out in one way or the other,' Mr Johnson said of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other eurozone leaders.

'Everybody in power in Europe basically reckons … they have got to try and keep this thing together so I think they will try to do a deal with [Greek prime minister] Tsipras.'

He also predicted to Bloomberg TV that there would be 'a huge amount of fudge all over the floor'.

Mr Johnson joined David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne in urging an end to the 'stand-off' between Athens and the eurozone leaders, warning of the 'huge contagious impact' of Greece crashing out of the single currency.

The Prime Minister used his first meeting with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels to urge him to reach a compromise over demands that the conditions of his country's vast bailout are torn up, ending years of austerity. He also suggested eurozone leaders should give some ground. 

Syriza, the most Left-wing party ever to take power in Europe, is threatening to turn to Russia for help if the eurozone cuts it adrift. Mr Cameron said: 'The British economy is growing but we are affected by the situation on the European continent and the longer this stand-off goes on the worse potentially that could be for Britain.'

German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has sent shockwaves through Europe by declaring that if Athens does not sign up to continue its aid and austerity programme 'then that's it'.

The European Central Bank is upping pressure on Greece to extend its bailout deal when its current one expires at the end of this month, or risk a bank collapse.

Mr Tsipras insists he has no intention of extending the €240billion EU/IMF package. Yesterday, ECB officials were said to be discussing how long they could continue to keep Greek banks afloat.

Mrs Merkel said: 'Europe always aims to find a compromise, and that is the success of Europe. Germany is ready for that.

'However, it must also be said that Europe's credibility naturally depends on us respecting rules and being reliable with each other.'
