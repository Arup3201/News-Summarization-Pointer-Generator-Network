In what looks like a scene from post-apocalyptic film, a Swedish developer has transformed towns and cities around the world into urban jungles.

Using Google images, Einar Oberg built his jungle version of Street View to lets users virtually travel anywhere in the world, and see what that location would look like covered in trees, vines, and bushes. 

Oberg has even redesigned Google’s iconic Pegman so he’s holding a fire torch and wearing an Indiana Jones-style fedora.

Urban Jungle Street View was built by Stockholm-based developer Einar Oberg. It uses depth data taken from Google's existing maps to plot 3D plants and tress over the top. Users then cover a location, such as Trafalgar Square in London pictured, with plants, trees and bushes

Search for a location, famous landmark or city.

Click on the Pegman and drop him on areas which light up in blue.

Not all areas within a location will be accessible.

Move the view around by clicking the mouse and moving it up, down, left and right.

Move forward by clicking the stone-like arrow.

To change location, click Back To Map in the top left-hand corner.

And when users drop the Pegman onto a location, a speech bubble appears saying: ‘I hope there are no snakes.’

Only areas accessible on Google Street View can be accessed on Oberg’s Urban Jungle version, for example, users can’t get inside the grounds of Buckingham Palace or The White House. 

The site images render slowly, and work better on the Chrome browser, although the service is also available on Firefox.

It has limited controls and users can only move around when clicking the stone-like arrow that appears on the screen.

Oberg said his Urban Jungle experiment uses an 'undocumented part of Street View' called depth data. Once depth maps are combined with traditional maps, Oberg said he is able to plot the position of 3D flora and fauna. This urban image is of 7th Avenue in New York

Oberg said: ‘Visit any place available in Street View by entering a location, drag the map to browse around and drop the little guy on a road. 

'It works best in environment with large buildings surrounding the streets. Some locations need a little more imagination than others.’

He continued the experiment uses an ‘undocumented part of Street View’ called depth data.

This means they appear to grow out of the map, or on the sides of buildings, as realistically as possible.

There have been similar projects in the past, namely the 2011 Streetview Zombie Apocalypse game.

It used Google Street View images as the base of the game and as players move around, they have to escape zombies placed over the top of the maps. 

The scenes created on Urban Jungle Street View are similar to those seen in the 2007 post-apocalyptic film I Am Legend, starring Will Smith, pictured

To turn a street into a jungle, users search for an exact location or for famous landmarks around the globe
