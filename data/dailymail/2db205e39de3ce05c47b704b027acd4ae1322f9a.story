Vodafone has made a multi-million pound settlement with HM Revenue & Customs in the wake of a dispute over the tax it had paid in Britain, it emerged last night.

The information was revealed after it was reported that the company ran an Irish subsidiary from a satellite office in Dublin for tax purposes.

Employing no staff for five years, the telecoms giant took advantage of Ireland’s generous corporate tax rate to record a £324million annual turnover collecting royalty payments for the use of its brand.

The UK-based group used the Irish subsidiary, which employed no staff between 2002 and 2007, to collect royalty payments from operating companies and joint ventures around the world.

During a four-year period, it emerged these royalty payments helped Vodafone Ireland Marketing Ltd send more than £850million worth of dividends to the low-tax jurisdiction of Luxembourg from their Dublin base. 

The dividends, which include a final payment of £121million due to be delivered this year, came from profits made after taking advantage of Ireland’s tax rates.

The disclosure comes as the British mobile phone group came under fire for its minimal corporation tax payments in the UK.

It also emerged that it is the largest
supplier of mobile phones to the UK government, with more than 30 
departments and public bodies, including the prime minister’s office, 
having contracts worth £14million a year with Vodafone.

The
Guardian newspaper reported that the accountancy structure struck by 
the multinational was similar to the one used by Apple in Ireland.

The website reported that Vodafone moved senior marketing managers to Dublin to protect global royalty revenues from UK taxation, and trigger a lower Irish corporation tax bill from 25 per cent to 12.5 per cent of profits.

This was significantly lower than the UK rate, which was 28 per cent of profits between 2008 and 2010.

A series of lively hearings of the Public Accounts Committee saw MPs savage companies such as Google for aggressively avoiding tax by exploiting legal loopholes.

Recently released figures show Google paid a paltry £10.6million in tax between 2006 and 2011 on revenue of £12 billion in the UK. 

The firm's boss Eric Schmidt appeared before the Committee in May, where chairman Margaret Hodge branded Google ‘devious’, ‘unethical’ and ‘evil’.

And Starbucks was revealed to have paid nothing in corporation tax in the last three years despite sales of £400million in 2011 and had only paid £8.6million since it began trading in the UK 14 years ago.

In June the coffee chain paid £5million of a £10million tax bill agreed with the Government for this year. It will pay a further £10million in tax next year.

Accounts filed in Dublin show that in 2009, the British taxman settled a dispute with Vodafone over its Irish tax returns, the website reported yesterday.

The overall size of the settlement has not been revealed, but it involved Vodafone reclaiming £57million from the Irish Government in tax that should have been paid in the UK, it reports.

Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile phone company by revenue, has paid no corporation tax in Britain for two successive years, despite paying £2.6billion in international taxes in 2012.

The company confirmed to the Guardian that its settlement had never been separately disclosed in its annual reports, and was not connected to a £1.25billion payment to the British revenue in 2010, to settle a much-publicised dispute over the use of a Luxembourg subsidiary.

A spokesman for HMRC refused to confirm whether any settlement over Vodafone’s Irish tax affairs had been made, saying it was prevented by law from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers.

Vodafone strongly rejected any suggestion of tax avoidance and said there have been no allegations of wrongdoing.

The company said its disputes with the UK taxman over its tax arrangements in Ireland and Luxembourg would not block it from government contracts under current rules.

A spokesman for Vodafone Ireland last night told the Irish Daily Mail she had ‘no comment to make’.

The matter concerns the tax issue of the Vodafone Group, which is a separate company for revenue and reporting structures.

Vodafone Group issued the following statement in response
to the story:

'Vodafone conducts itself in full compliance with the law and
always operates under a policy of full transparency with the tax authorities in
all countries in which we operate.

'Vodafone's relationship with tax authorities is based on
complete disclosure and a rigorous adherence to due process at all times.

'Vodafone's Group brand and marketing function was
established during a period of significant international expansion and as a
global business it is feasible to locate centralised Group functions in a
number of different locations depending on a range of factors.

'In 2001, Dublin was identified as a location for this
activity on a number of grounds including the commercial, regulatory and tax
environment in Ireland at that time and Vodafone began to use a Dublin-based
subsidiary to collect royalties and brand management fees from operating
companies and partners to fund the development of the Vodafone brand around the
world.

'Vodafone's relationship with tax authorities is based on
complete disclosure and a rigorous adherence to due process at all times'

'The royalty payments that were made were done so under
domestic and international transfer pricing rules which are set up by
governments to allocate appropriate taxable profits from one country to
another.

'The company’s local UK and Italy operating companies
continued to pay fees to Vodafone Group in the UK and no royalties have ever
been paid from the UK to Ireland or elsewhere.

'The settlement with HMRC related to a number of technical
factors regarding inter-Group transfer pricing arrangements. Notably,
throughout the period covered by the settlement, the profits of VIML had been
taxed by the Irish authorities at the rate of 25 per cent.

'In accordance with the Treaty between the UK and Ireland
which prevents double taxation on the same income, the Irish government
credited taxes previously paid by Vodafone and these were then paid to the UK
Treasury as part of the overall settlement.

'This was disclosed in Vodafone's annual report and accounts.

'In 2011, the Vodafone Group revisited the decision to locate
its brand activities in Ireland and decided instead to consolidate the global
brand and marketing function within the UK from October.'
