The father of a five-year-old girl who was killed in Nebraska's tornadoes on Monday is heading to the state to plan her funeral - while her mother remains in a coma unaware of her child's death.

Elijah Dixon, who lives in Athens, Alabama, learned about the death of his daughter, Calista Dixon, while he was bartending at an Applebee's in Madison on Monday, his manager told AL.com.

'This is the most 
heartbreaking thing I have ever been through,' he in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

His other daughter, four-year-old Robin, and her brother, 21-year-old Cody Murphree, were unhurt when the rare dual tornadoes barreled through their mobile home in Pilger.

But their sister and mother, 42-year-old 
Kandi Murphree, were found surrounded by debris and lying in a road 
nearby and rushed to hospital.

Murphree sustained a brain and leg injury when the twister
 struck and has been put in a medically-induced coma, meaning she does not know her daughter has passed away.

The tragedy comes just four months after she moved her family to Pilger from Huntsville, 
Alabama when her elderly parents asked if she would help them.

Her mother Kay Labenz, 69, told the Omaha World-Herald that she had asked her daughter to move to help her as she underwent surgery and her father, Les, who has a muscular problem.

After 
initially staying with her parents, Murphree moved her children into 
their own home and found a job as a cashier and was grateful for her 
parents' help looking after her brood, the World-Herald reported.

On Monday,
 Murphree finished her shift at Prime Stop in Wayne, picked up her girls
 from her mother's home and took them to their place down the street.

Her son, Cody, was at work installing shingles when he got the news that tornadoes were heading towards his new hometown. He called his mother and told her to seek shelter immediately.

After the tornado hit, Labenz frantically
 tried to contact her daughter and sent Cody to Faith Regional Medical 
Center in Norfolk, where most victims had been sent.

There he found that his little sister Calista had passed away.

'From
 what I hear, they were trying to make it to across the street to either
 the bank or the gas station, but by that time it was just too late and 
everything hit,' Murphree said.

After calling other Omaha hospitals, 
the family learned that Murphree was at Creighton University Medical 
Center in critical condition.

Cody added that his sister was a beautiful girl who dreamed of becoming a doctor when she grew up.

The
 twister destroyed scores of homes as it barreled through Pilger, 
killing Calista and 74-year-old David A. Herout. At least 19 others were
 taken to hospitals with injuries.

Mr Herout, of Clarkson, was killed after his vehicle left a county road east of Pilger, and he was ejected from the car.

Up to 75 per cent of the buildings in Pilger were heavily damaged or destroyed. The tornado crushed much of the small downtown, leaving piles of bricks that had been storefronts in the street.

Between 45 and 50 homes in Pilger were demolished, about a dozen others were damaged beyond repair in Dixon County.

Cody 
Murphee's coworkers have established a fund to help temporarily feed and
 clothe him and Robin, who lost their belongings in the storm.

Donations can be made to First Nebraska Bank, PO Box 10, Wayne, NE 68787.
