A Nottinghamshire town believed to be the most ‘seismically active’ area in the UK has experienced more than 30 small earthquakes in the last 50 days.

Geologists have said that mining in the area is likely to explain New Ollerton’s large number of tremors, which have had recorded magnitudes of up to 1.7.

There have been 36 tremors recorded in New Ollerton since December 10, 2013. In this period, there have been a total of 49 around the British isles.

New Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, has been the setting for 36 out of 49 tremors recorded across the British Isles in the last 50 days. The latest was recorded yesterday at 3am, with a magnitude of 1.5

In the last week alone, there have been five small earthquakes in the area, the last of which was recorded yesterday at 3am with a magnitude of 1.5.

According to the BBC, UK Coal said the recent earthquakes could have been the result of mining at Thoresby Colliery. But the body said residents should not be concerned.

The British Geological Survey said it is possible that all of the tremors in the area have originated from the same location.

It also said that many of the tremors have been felt by local residents.

The BGS said: ‘Earthquakes of this size are not likely to cause any damage and the hazard from mining-induced seismicity in the UK is typically low.’

The body added that there have been no reports of structural damage from mining-induced earthquakes in the UK for 40 years and the maximum observed has had a magnitude of around three.

Although the BGS said the tremors are not always detectable, one New Ollerton resident has complained of the damage they are causing.

Yvonne Allwood has told how earthquakes in the New Ollerton area have caused damage in her home

Yvonne Allwood, who runs butcher ship S. Allwood & Son in the town, claims the tremors regularly send plant pots and pictures in her kitchen crashing to the floor.

‘I was baking in the kitchen and the next thing, everything fell off the shelf and I thought, “I bet that's been another earthquake”.’

However, she said she doesn't find the earthquakes scary: ‘I don't mind [them] at all. They're tiny things. 

'I'm not about to be sucked into a hole. It's no big deal really.’

Earthquakes are usually the result of a slip along per-existing faults in the earth.

According to the British Geological Survey, human activities, including mining, can change the state of stress near faults.

Likely causes of changing stress are the ‘removal of sub-surface rock', or it can also be caused 'by the collapse of old mine workings, which can move the faults closer to failure and result in induced earthquakes’.

The body says: ‘This process is only likely to affect faults within relatively small distances of the stress perturbation and mining induced earthquakes generally within of a few kilometres of the mining activity.

‘Similarly, sometimes the induced events occur shortly after the mining activity begins, but in other cases they happen long after it has ceased.’
