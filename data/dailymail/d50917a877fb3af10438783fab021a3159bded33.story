Michelle Obama doesn't want jewelry or chocolates for her 50th birthday later this month. She wants to be alone. 

President Barack Obama returned to Washington Saturday after two weeks of vacationing with his family in Hawaii. He left with daughters Sasha and Malia. Michelle stayed behind.

'As part of her birthday gift from the president, the first lady will remain in Hawaii to spend time with friends ahead of her upcoming 50th birthday,' the White House explained in a statement.

The First Lady turns the big 5 - 0 on January 17.

The White House did not say how much longer Michelle would stay in Hawaii or when she would rejoin her family in Washington.

Michelle's alone time follows a family Christmas vacation filled with golf outings and dinner out.

The four Obamas - including daughters Sasha, 12, and Malia, 15 - were seen around the northern end of the island of Oahu.

On Sunday morning, President Obama and his daughters landed in Washington following an overnight flight on Air Force One - ending 15 days of vacation.

The president played one last round of golf at Marine Corps Base Hawaii - one of several rounds he got in over his vacation.

Then, the family of four ate dinner at Buzz's Lanikai - a favorite steakhouse and seafood restaurant that the Obamas have visited on past vacations.

The Obama girls return to school at Sidwell Friends on Monday.
