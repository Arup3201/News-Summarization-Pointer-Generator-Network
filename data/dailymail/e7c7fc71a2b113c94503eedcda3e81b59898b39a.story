Whether you are an established author or an aspiring one, there is plenty on offer for you this year at The London Book Fair in Author HQ, LBF's home for writers and aspiring writers.

There is a fantastic line-up of speakers, publishers, writers and agents at this year's fair

Author HQ is one of the most popular features of the fair, with three days of seminars providing writers with the knowledge and tools they need to help them publish their work.

A fantastic line-up of speakers — publishers, writers and agents — will share their secrets and expertise, and a series of fascinating seminars will cover topics such as the roles of publisher and literary agent, jacket design and the varied ways publishers and agents now discover new talent. Booksellers will give advice on how to sell your book, and journalists will talk about what they are looking for when deciding which books to cover.

There will also be seminars on the allimportant topics of PR and marketing and, with social media giving authors the power to connect directly with their readers, the Successful Social Media Strategies seminar will look at ways authors can make the best of this powerful new opportunity.

The London Book Fair, one of the most important events in the publishing calendar, takes place from April 14 to 16 at Olympia, West London. Entry to all Author HQ events is free with the purchase of a three-day LBF pass (£35 if booked in advance). Seminars are first come, first served. Visit londonbookfair.co.uk/authors
