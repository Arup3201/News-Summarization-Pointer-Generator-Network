In an effort to decrease a growing wave of iPhone thefts known as 'Apple picking', the tech company unveiled a 'kill switch'-style update to make the expensive gadgets less appealing to would-be robbers.

New iPhones will be equipped with a 'kill switch' to make them useless if stolen, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developer's Conference last week according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 

The tech-giant is the first to respond to calls from law enforcement agencies frustrated by an increase in violent cell phone thefts known as 'Apple picking'—though Microsoft, Samsung and other manufacturers are not immune to the problem.

'Kill Switch': As part of an update to the operating system and the 'Find My Phone' application, iPhone users will be able to deactivate their devices online

As part of the latest operating system update to the iPhone this fall, users will be able to deactivate their stolen smartphone online through what Apple calls an activation lock—effectively a 'kill switch'. Even if the owner's SIM card is removed, a thief can't erase the phone's data without a username and password.

An Apple ID and password are also required to turn off the new 'Find My Phone' application--which tracks a stolen or lost phone's GPS location. A custom message, such as 'This iPhone is lost. Please call me' will be continuously displayed even if thieves manage to erase the phone.

'We think this is going to be a really powerful theft deterrent,' Apple's senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said at the developer's conference on June  10.

Kill switches will be added to all Apple mobile devices, the Chronicle reported. 

Law enforcement agencies and advocates have been battling a spike in 'Apple picking' for several years, as mobile electronic gadgets become even more popular. One poll showed nearly 10 per cent of cell users said they've had their phone stolen at some point, according to Time.

Some 'Apple picking' crimes have been particularly violent.

In February, three people were stabbed on a New York City subway platform in a fight over an iPhone. This month, a woman was mugged at gunpoint in the city for her Android device. In three incidents last September, women were attacked for Apple and Samsung gadgets, according to a statement by  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. 

Theft of Apple products alone has increased so much in New York City that the city's police established a unit to work with the company to retrieve stolen products, according to the New York Post.

'We’re looking for ways to find individuals who have stolen Apple products and return the products to their original owners,' NYPD spokesman Paul Browne told the Post. 'It is being done to learn the pattern who is stealing.'

Overall crime in the city would have decreased had it not been for stolen mobile devices, CNN reported. The city saw an 40 per cent increase in mobile thefts in 2012.

Apple's announcement came just three days before Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón launched a nationwide 'Secure Our Smartphone' Initiative to find a 'meaningful' solution to smartphone thefts. 

'The epidemic of violent street crime involving the theft and resale of mobile devices is a very real and growing threat in communities all across America,' Schneiderman said in a statement when the initiative was launched Thursday.

'Smartphones have become a part of our everyday lives. Over half of the U.S. population owns a smartphone, creating an environment ripe for violent street crimes,' added Gascón.

Cell phone thefts make up 30 to 40 per cent of all robberies in America, according to a Consumer Reports statistic noted in their statement.

Representatives from Apple, Google/Motorola, Samsung and Microsoft also participated in a smartphone summit at Schneiderman’s office in New York on Thursday.

When the new 'kill switch' feature was announced, Schneiderman and Gascón said in a joint statement they 'are appreciative of the gesture' but said they 'reserve judgment on the activation lock feature until we can understand its actual functionality'.

The activation lock feature only works when a device is connected to WiFi or is turned on with its data plan activated.

'We are hopeful that the cell phone industry will imbed persistent technology that is free to consumers that will make a phone inoperable once stolen, even if the device is off, the SIM card is removed, or the phone is modified by a thief to avoid detection,' the joint statement added.
