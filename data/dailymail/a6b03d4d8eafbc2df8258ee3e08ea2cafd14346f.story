These birds, butterflies, beasts and bugs are among hundreds of species which have become extinct in England over the last 200 years.

Wildlife experts have today launched the largest ever online portal of information about the incredible 421 species which have disappeared from our country since 1814.

The Species Recovery Trust, which is behind the Lost Life Project, hopes that by publicising this issue they can help prevent a further loss of biodiversity.

The Scottish Wildcat is much bulkier than a domestic cat, with thick fur and a non-tapered tail. They once roamed the forests and grasslands of Europe, but are now extinct in England, Wales and Scandinavia and numbers in Scotland are critically low with less than 100 remaining

'It’s so easy to think of species 
extinction as something that happened decades ago in England, but year 
upon year we continue to lose species, at a rate which is far higher 
than would occur naturally,' said Dominic Price, director of the Trust.

'Sometimes the list of extinct species names can seem rather dry and scientific so this project aimed to find as many pictures as still existed of these species, to give a fitting testament to the role they played in lighting up our countryside, and highlighting the tragedy that these lights have now gone out.'

The Red-backed shrike became extinct in 1988 due to habitat loss, agricultural intensification and egg collecting. These birds, butterflies, beasts and bugs are among hundreds of species which have become extinct in England over the last 200 years

The black-backed meadow ant became extinct in 1988 due to urban development and inappropriate land management

The world is currently experiencing the sixth mass extinction event, with species disappearing as a result of habitat loss, intensification of agriculture and pollution, as well as other human activities.

England’s lost species include ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, dragonflies, fish, fleas, fungi, mammals, moths, shrimps, spiders and wasps.

The plant Davall’s Sedge was once found at a site in Somerset, but in the 19th Century it was drained for development and has never again been seen in this country.

Ivell’s Sea Anemone, which was only ever found in England, has become globally extinct following changes in water quality as its one known site.

The Trachea atriplicis or orache moth  became extinct in 1905 due to the drainage of fens. The Species Recovery Trust aims to remove 50 species from the edge of extinction in the UK by 2050 through effective conservation strategies.

The Gomphus clavatus or pig's ear fungus became extinct in 1927 due to habitat loss and degradation

In Victorian times the large tortoiseshell butterfly was widespread in southern England, but it became extinct in 1953 due to Dutch elm disease, which eradicated the main larval food source.

The great auk (left) was a flightless bird which grew up to 85cm tall and became globally extinct in the mid-19th century. The dainty damselfly (right), which has a blue body, was once found in Essex but severe flooding in 1953 destroyed its breeding sites

In Victorian times the Large tortoiseshell butterfly was common in woods in the south of England. But the beautiful insect has since suffered a severe decline and is now extinct in the British Isles. Causes of decline include climate change and Dutch Elm disease which eradicated its main larval food source. It is now found in mainland Europe, northern Africa and western Asia

The Species Recovery Trust has now launched an online database with information and images of England’s lost species.

'If we continue to allow these extinctions to occur, this country will soon be bereft of the biodiversity that remains,' added Dominic.

'We hope the website will raise awareness and knowledge about conservation issues in this country, and inspire people to become more involved in protecting their local biodiversity.

Cladonia peziziformis became extinct in 1968 due to human disturbance, inappropriate use of burning for land management, the natural succession of heathland vegetation and high grazing levels

The Great yellow bumblebee (left) was once found across Great Britain, but habitat loss and agricultural intensification have caused its range to contract, and it became extinct in England in 1981. Chlorochroa juniperina(right), a type of beetle, became extinct in 1925 due to a decline of juniper, its host

Meloe variegatus became extinct in 1882 due to changes in land management. The Species Recovery Trust, which is behind the Lost Life Project, hopes that by publicising this issue they can help prevent a further loss of biodiversity

The Saxifraga rosacea (left)  became extinct in 1960 due to overgrazing and pollution. Lixus angustatus nec algirus became extinct in 1928

'One of the primary aims of the Species Recovery Trust is to prevent this list from getting any longer.

'We believe that by both raising awareness about the tragic extinctions that have already occurred and focusing our work on the very rarest species in the UK, we can prevent further losses from occurring.'

The Species Recovery Trust aims to remove 50 species from the edge of extinction in the UK by 2050 through effective conservation strategies.
