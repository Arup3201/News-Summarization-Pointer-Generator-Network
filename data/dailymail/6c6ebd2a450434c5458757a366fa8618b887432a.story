The life of Marilyn Monroe will once again be brought to the screen, but this time the small screen as Lifetime has announced it will be making a miniseries about the iconic actress, starring a woman who has had a storied career herself - Susan Sarandon.

The Oscar winner, who took home a golden statue for her work in Dead Man Walking, is set to star as Monroe's mother Gladys Baker in the new series, appropriately titled Marilyn.

It should be a very juicy role for the actress, as Baker was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose own life may have been even more traumatic than that of her tragic daughter.

Complicated woman: Baker (above with a young Marilyn) was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose own mother committed suicide and whose father died of syphilitic insanity

Legend: Monroe (above) would go on to become one of the most famous actors of the twentieth century

Baker watched as her mother killed herself and her father died of syphilitic insanity, eventually becoming a devout Christian after a wild youth, and raising her daughter to believe that sex should be avoided at all costs. 

Monroe of course would go on to have numerous tumultuous relationships in her lifetime, most famously with two of the men she married, baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the role of Monroe has not yet been cast.

This news comes as rumors of yet another big screen movie about Monroe, this one titled Blonde, continue to swirl, with reports stating earlier this year that Jessica Chastain would play the blonde bombshell after Naomi Watts dropped out of the project.

Perfect: Michelle Williams (above) gave perhaps the most definitive portrayal of the actress in the 2011 film My Week With Marilyn, earning an Oscar nomination for her work

No doubt making the task of playing Monroe that much more daunting is the critical praise that was heaped upon the last actress to portray her, Michelle Williams, who went on to earn an Academy Award nomination for her pitch perfect performance in the 2011 film My Week With Marilyn.

Said Roger Ebert of Williams' work on the film, 'She evokes so many Marilyns, public and private, real and make-believe. We didn't know Monroe, but we believe she must have been something like his

Of course an obvious choice for the role could be Sarandon's own daughter, actress Eva Amurri.

Ideal casting?: The role of Monroe has yet to be cast, but sarandon's own daughter Eva Amurri (above) would be a natural choice

The two have shared the screen in films like The Banger Sisters and Middle of Nowhere, in which they played mother and daughter, as well as That's My Boy, in which they played the younger and older version of the same woman. 

The four hour miniseries, based on J. Randy Taraborrelli's book, The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe, is set to start filming later this year.

It will air in 2015.
