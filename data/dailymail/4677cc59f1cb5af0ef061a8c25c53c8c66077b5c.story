Ander Herrera says he 'can't wait to play for Louis van Gaal' in his first interview since joining Manchester United for £29million, and feels lucky to get his chance at Old Trafford.

The midfielder, who settled into life in England by visiting Wimbledon's Centre Court on Saturday, joined from Athletic Bilbao after a medical at Carrington HQ on Thursday.

And the 24-year-old, speaking in broken English, was more than complimentary for his new boss, who is currently managing Holland at the World Cup.

'I cant wait to play for Van Gaal, with my teammates and for Manchester United.'

Herrera was the first of two signings in as many days, as United welcomed Southampton left-back Luke Shaw to the red side of Manchester for £31.5m.

Shaw, 18, became the most expensive teenage signing in history and brought United's summer spending up to £60.5m.
