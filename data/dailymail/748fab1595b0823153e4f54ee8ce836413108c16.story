British jihadists fighting in Syria for the Islamic State have posted sickening online messages joking about the beheading of James Foley.

Two friends from Cardiff, who appeared in a chilling recruitment video for the terror group in June, have continued to post vile comments, defying attempts to censor them.

Last week Reyaad Khan, 20, mocked the horrific murder on Twitter, saying: ‘The brother that executed James Foley should be the new Batman.’

He also glorified a recent raid by IS on the Al-Tabqa air base in Syria, which led to the cold-blooded execution of more than 200 soldiers belonging to the Assad regime, tweeting ‘Heavy clashes in tabqa, fireworks on the agenda tonight!’

His friend Nasser Muthana, also 20 and from Cardiff, has posted a video showing a building at the air base being detonated by a bomb he claims to have devised.

Khan – like many British jihadis – is a frequent user of Twitter with almost 1,500 followers. His previous account appears to have been closed down, but he had a new one within days.

His first tweet was: ‘New account lol spread the word “these terrorists keep coming back”. ’

Execution: Khan praised Mr Foley’s executioner and suggested he has been part of a group carrying out a beheading, saying 'Took 4 of us to do it'. Above, Mr Foley is seen in a sickening video that captured his murder

He also praised Mr Foley’s executioner, and suggests he has been part of a group carrying out a beheading: ‘Crazy man. Brothers like 6’4 and hench [strong] lol took 4 of us to do it.’

Muthana boasted that IS was trading the Yazidi women captured by IS militants earlier this month for £1,200 each. He also bragged about having his own concubines.

Khan, Muthana and his brother Aseel, 17, all left Cardiff last year to join IS.
