It may be more used to world leaders than beginner readers - but the White House this week played host to a class of schoolkids and the Cat In The Hate thanks to Michelle Obama.

The First Lady hosted a reception in the stately East Room of the Presidential residence, and danced, jumped and did the limbo with an audience of 40 pupils from schools around Washington, D.C.

As well as bouncing up and down and hopping on one leg, the esteem visitors were also treated to a public rendition of the President's new favorite reading material - a Dr Seuss-style guide to staying healthy as a kid.

Before launching into her reading, Mrs Obama revealed that she had looked through the picture book with her husband before he left that day on Marine One - and that Dr Seuss rhymes are a family favorite.

However, while most Seuss tales are whimsical romps just meant to delight children, the latest product had the joint purpose of plugging the First Lady's Let's Move initiative to fighting childhood obesity.

Entitled Oh, the Things You Can Do That Are Good For You, Mrs Obama's book included government-approved public health advice, such as instructions for kids to exercise for an hour every day, remember to brush their teeth, and eat pumpkin seeds.

Listening: The versified public health pamphlet included advice for the young children, which Mrs Obama later had them repeat back to her

The First Lady's reading, complete with big pictures and actions from a Cat In The Hat and Thing #1 and Thing #2 brought in for the event, also covered how to sneeze properly and a reminder to wear a helmet when you cycle.

One of the points made was Mrs Obama's oft-repeated dictum that half of a meal should consist of fruit and vegetables, which was translated into Seuss rhyming couplets.

At one point The First Lady read: 'Now it's time to step up to my rainbow buffet, Filled with colorful foods we should eat every day.

'There are lots to choose from and their power is great - Veggies and fruit should fill half of your plate.'

After the rendition - which also included instruction to sleep 10 hours a day - Mrs Obama had the children repeat her lessons back to her, before striking up a demonstration exercise session.

Children were told to stand up, jump around and pretend to ride their bicycle through their august surroundings. For a time, the children even struck up a limbo competition.

They were later fed healthy snacks mentioned in the book by the White House kitchen. 

The meeting was tied to the First Lady's public health ambitions - which includes a commitment to eliminating child obesity within a generation.
