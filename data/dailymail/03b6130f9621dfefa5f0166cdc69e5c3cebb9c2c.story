The friend has been exchanging text messages with the 28-year-old Ferguson officer and said: 'I can tell that this is really hard on him.'

A woman called Josie called a St Louis radio station this weekend in defense of Michael Brown shoot Darren Wilson (pictured). She said that Brown had rushed at the officer after trying to grab his gun and punching him 

A male friend of Michael Brown shooter, Officer Darren Wilson, spoke out to defend his friend on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety

The friend also said that he had played hockey with Wilson for years and had never seen him get into a fight. 

The show of support for Officer Wilson came after a female friend told a radio station this weekend that the cop shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, because the teen tried to grab his gun, punched him in the face and then charged at him on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. 

A woman calling herself 'Josie' called The Dana Show last Friday to say Wilson had told her Brown had 'bum-rushed' him prior to the shooting.  

'Josie', who would only give her first name but said she was friends with the cop's girlfriend, had her account corroborated by a source who said it matched what Wilson told investigators,CNN reported on Monday. 

The woman said most friends and family were too afraid to speak out but she wanted the public to know Wilson's side of the story.

Josie said that on August 9, Wilson came across Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of a street in the St Louis suburb and pulled up to tell them to get on to the sidewalk.  

'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' she told KFTK.

'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them.

Michael Brown was shot dead on August 9 by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri 

'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up.

'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip.

'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off.

'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. 

'So, he stands up and yells, ''Freeze!'' Michael and his friend turn around.

'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bum-rushing him. He just started coming at him full speed.

So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something, because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable.

'And so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two to three feet in front of the officer.'  

The friend's report, which has not been verified, added to the growing number of different versions of events from the day of the fatal shooting.

According to St Louis Post-Dispatch crime reporter Christine Byers on Monday, more than a dozen witnesses had backed up Officer Wilson's report of what happened on August 9.

The reporter later admitted she was on maternity leave and her post was 'personal'.

Gilbert Bailon, editor for the St Louis Post-Dispatch, issued a statement which read: 'Christine Byers is a police reporter for the St Louis Post-Dispatch who has been on FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) since March. She is not involved in the Ferguson coverage while she is on leave. Her tweets are personal.

'She has tweeted today in regards to her tweet Monday: "On FMLA from papaer. Earlier tweets did not meet standards for publication."'

Wilson is on paid administrative leave following the shooting and pending the outcome of the investigation.

The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February  this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.' 

Assistant pathologist Shawn Parcells told CNN on Monday afternoon that it cannot be proved from the initial autopsy whether Brown was rushing the officer or simply standing at a distance.

Earlier on Monday, an eye-witness to the shooting released a video of Brown in the street with Wilson pacing back and forth beside his lifeless body in the street.

Piaget Crenshaw lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street where the 18-year-old was killed.  She said today that she waited until now to release the video as she feared for her safety and the officer's name had not been released. 

She told CNN today that she had recorded the incident because she believed that something was wrong. 

Officer Darren Wilson looks at the body of teenager Michael Brown lying dead in a Missouri street last Saturday after he fired multiple shots  

'From it all initially happening, I knew this was not right,' Miss Crenshaw said. 'I knew the police shouldn't have been chasing this boy and firing at the same time. 

'And the fact he got shot in his face, something clicked in me and I thought someone else should see this so I recorded.'

The radio caller's version of events also contradicted the statement of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson who said at press conference on Friday that Officer Wilson was unaware of the store robbery when he stopped Brown.

Chief Jackson released the name of Officer Wilson last Friday after mounting public pressure. He had waited after saying that the officer received death threats on social media.  

The Brown family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said on Monday that the teenager had been 'executed in broad daylight' as the results of their independent autopsy were revealed. 

Professor Shawn Parcells points on Monday to one of the shots that hit teen Michael Brown during a preliminary autopsy report conducted on behalf of the family 

Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, medical examiner Dr Michael Baden revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds.

Dr Baden told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday that he had reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son did not suffer.

The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by Wilson. 

Eye-witnesses have also claimed that Brown had his hands up to signal that he was surrendering. 

The shooting of the unarmed black teenager has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet Missouri suburb. 

Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am. 

Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order.

He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'.   

Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol.
