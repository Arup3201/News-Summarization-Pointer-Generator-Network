Wesley Sneijder is delighted to be linked with a move to Manchester United - but would not leave Galatasaray for Louis van Gaal’s flagging side.

The Dutch playmaker has been on United’s radar for several years but looked closer than ever to an Old Trafford move when compatriot Van Gaal - who Sneijder says is a footballing genius - took the helm.

With United having an embarrassment of riches in attacking midfield, Sneijder said he wouldn’t be tempted to leave the Turkish giants.

‘It is great to hear that Van Gaal is interested in me, he is a footballing genius,’ Sneijder told Turkish station AMK.

‘However I doubt Manchester United could tempt me to leave Galatasaray right now, I don’t see it happening.

‘Everything is going well for me in Istanbul and I have settled into life in Turkey and feel at home. I don’t even know why we keep talking about this.

‘Galatasaray will not be letting me go for a cheap price. It is very unlikely that any deal will happen.’ 

Sneijder says he's settled and happy with life and football in Istanbul, and his club won't let him go lightly
