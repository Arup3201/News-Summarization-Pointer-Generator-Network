Last week’s Powerball jackpot winner never intended to buy the $400 million golden ticket. The South Carolina man was actually just at the store to buy hot dog buns.

The lucky guy has chosen to remain anonymous, but lottery officials say the newly minted millionaire was sent out to bye the buns by his wife and when the Lexington gas station didn’t have what he wanted, he bought $20 worth of lottery tickets instead.

It was only the man’s second time ever playing the lottery. And the first person he told as he danced around his kitchen: the family dog.

Frenzy: Reporters swarmed the Murphy Express gas stationi n Lexington, South Carolina Thursday after it was revealed to be the point of sale of the fourth largest winning Powerball ticket in history

The winner cashed in South Carolina’s biggest jackpot ticket ever on Monday and has told lottery officials that he wants to remain anonymous, something a handful of states allow.

The lottery released a few details about last week's winner, who lives in Columbia.

He stopped to get gas at a Murphy Express gas station outside Columbia in Lexington, South Carolina the day of the drawing last Wednesday.

His wife had sent him out to buy some hot dog buns, but the store didn't sell buns. After seeing the $400 million prize advertised, he bought lottery tickets instead.

Cha-ching! The Murphy Express is the second of the chain to sell a giant Powerball jackpot ticket. The other one was across town on the other side of Columbia, South Carolina where a reverend bought a ticket worth $260M in 2009

Just make it out to cash: The unnamed South Carolina winner who will pocket $400M from Wednesday's Powerball jackpot bought the winning ticket only after the store was out of hot dog buns

It was only his second time playing the lottery.

The winner checked his ticket Thursday at his home and realized he was a winner. He told the only creature around, his dog.

His dog, his wife and lottery officials may be the only people who know the winner for certain. South Carolina is one of only six Powerball states that allow winners to refuse to let their identities to be released. The others are Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota and Ohio.

Lottery officials aren't saying whether the man took the $399.4 million payout over 30 years or the direct cash option of $233 million.

The jackpot was the fourth largest in the history of the game and the South Carolina man was the only winner.

Meanwhile, the jackpots have grown 
exponentially since the ticket price doubled from $1 to $2 in January 
and after California, America’s most populous state, joined the fray in 
April.

Lucky dog: The man claims it was only his second time ever playing the lottery and that he told his dog before anyone else

An 84-year-old 
Florida woman became the winner of the largest Powerball jackpot ever in
May. Gloria C. MacKenzie hit all the numbers for a $590 million 
jackpot.

In August, the 
so-called Ocean’s 16—a group of Ocean County, New Jersey government 
workers—won a third of that month’s $449 million jackpot.

One
of the other August jackpot tickets was also sold in South Brunswick, 
New Jersey—to a man named Mario Scarnici. The other winner, Paul White, 
bought his ticket in his home state of Minnesota.

The man was all alone when he read the
winning numbers: 7-10-22-32-35, with the Powerball of 19. They were 
selected by the computer as a ‘quick-pick.’

ODDS

Miracles happen: Balloons and a sign announcing a winner of the Powerball drawing are set up in front of Murphy Express store on Thursday. The winner eventually came forward, though anonymously

A person's odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175 million.

Your odds of picking the winning numbers remain the same regardless of how many people play or how big the jackpot gets.

And with so many number combinations, your odds pretty much remain the same whether you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets.

BIG JACKPOTS

In January 2012, Powerball tickets went from $1 to $2, which led to larger jackpots in smaller amounts of time.

Of the top 10 Powerball jackpots of all time, nearly half have been recorded since the game change.

CONSOLATION PRIZE

Since the revamp, a secondary $1 million prize has made for some happy losers. More than 730 people have won $1 million, and more than 120 people have won $2 million through the Power Play option.

SOMEONE IS GOING TO WIN - BUT PROBABLY NOT YOU

A six-number combination will always be chosen, so even though the odds of your combination winning are astronomically low, the chances are high that someone, somewhere, will win.

It's math: Don't plan on winning. It's hard for people to grasp how small their chances actually are, since no one can really see 175 million of anything.

If you lined up 175 dollar bills, the line would twice stretch along the edges of the continental United States. Or cover 380 football fields. Yet only one of those bills would have the winning numbers.

The
winning ticket was bought at a Murphy Express just off Interstate 20 
west of Columbia, the state capital. The store will get a $50,000 bonus 
for selling the winning ticket.

State officials said the winner will pay South Carolina about $15 million in taxes.

‘I
can't tell you what it feels like to know someone has been that 
fortunate and that lucky,’ said Paula Harper Bethea, executive director 
of the South Carolina Educational Lottery. She told ABC News the 
windfall is  ‘wonderful shot in the arm for our state.’

The
last big Powerball winner in South Carolina also bought his winning 
ticket at a Murphy Express, but on the other side of Columbia.

The
Reverend Solomon Jackson Jr. won nearly $260 million in 2009. He has 
been active in the community, giving millions of dollars for education 
around the state. Two days after last week's big jackpot drawing, 
Jackson gave $500,000 to purchase two new 56-seat luxury coach buses for
Benedict College in Columbia.

Jubilant: Unlike the South Carolina winner, Paul White (here with partner Kim VanReese) of Minnesota all but ran to a press conference following his $150M Powerball win in August

The winner is the only Powerball player in the country who hit all the numbers and will thus claim the entire prize

He told lottery officials he was alone when he realized he'd won, so he danced around the kitchen and celebrated with his dog
