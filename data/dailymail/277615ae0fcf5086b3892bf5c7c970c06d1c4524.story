The Olympic North Korean flag blunder which sparked a diplomatic row has been blamed on a video producer in London, it was reported today.

North Korea's women footballers walked off in protest before their match with Colombia yesterday when the flag of bitter rivals South Korea was mistakenly shown on the big screen in Scotland's Hampden Park.

The North Koreans were only persuaded to play the match an hour later once the foul-up had been rectified.

It emerged today that the blunder has 
been blamed on an Olympic official who sent the big screen video package
introducing players from London to Hampden.

Hampden Park organisers had no input 
in the video, which introduced North Korea's side by showing a South 
Korean player and flag, according to BBC Scotland.

Locog has refused to name the person 
responsible, but the official in question has since offered their 
resignation, according to the Telegraph.

Games organisers have issued an 
apology over the incident, while Prime Minster David Cameron today said 
it was an 'honest mistake'.

Speaking on a visit to the Olympic 
Park, Mr Cameron said: 'This was an honest mistake, honestly made, an 
apology has been made and I'm sure every step will be taken to make sure
these things don't happen again.

'We shouldn't over-inflate this episode. It was unfortunate, it shouldn't have happened and I think we can leave it at that.'

North Korea went on to win the warm-up
match 2-0, but coach Gun Sin Ui stressed the gravity of the incident 
and said he planned to take up the matter with Games organisers Locog 
and FIFA.

Mr Ui said: 'The national flag 
difference is a big problem.Our team was not going to participate unless
the problem was solved properly.

'Unfortunately it took some time later
for the broadcast to be done again properly and we made the decision to
go on with the match.'

Asked whether he believed the wrong 
flag had deliberately been used, Mr Ui said: 'That was the question I 
was going to ask Locog and Fifa.'

Locog said: ‘The South Korean flag was shown on a big screen video package instead of the North Korean flag.

'Clearly this is a mistake. We will 
apologise to the team and the National Olympic Committee and steps will 
be taken to ensure this does not happen again.’

North are South Korea are neighbours but have a far from harmonious relationship.

The countries were formally 
established as separate entities in 1948, and the Korean War began in 
1950. The animosity continues today and the two countries share the 
world's most heavily fortified border.

Team GB celebrate first win after women's footballers beat NZ

Victory cheer: Winning goal scorer Stephanie Houghton of Great Britain celebrates victory on the final whistle as Amber Hearn of New Zealand looks dejected

There was a much better atmosphere 
down in Wales, where a crowd of 24,545 saw Team GB’s women footballers 
chalk up the country’s first victory of the Games yesterday with a 1-0 
win over New Zealand.

The first Olympic action on British 
soil since 1948 began at 4pm with a blast of the referee’s whistle at 
the 74,500-capacity Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

The winning goal that
took Team GB one step along their way to Wembley came in the 63rd 
minute from a free kick from Arsenal’s Stephanie Houghton, 27.

This was the first time a women’s team has represented Britain at any Olympics, even though the fairer sex has been playing the beautiful game since 1895.

One day a future Equality Act may insist on calling it simply football, but right now the women are still the underdogs.

That was effectively underlined 
yesterday when George Lineker, whose father Gary is the face of football
on the BBC, referred on Twitter to the triumphant side as ‘birds trying
to play football’.

He told 
his followers the opening event was making him ‘lose the will to live’. 
Blokishly, he added that he was heading off down the pub.

But here in Cardiff it was a dramatically different atmosphere, in which patriotism overwhelmed sexism.

Team GB's men football team face Senegal tonight at 7.45pm in a first-round Group A match.

The game will take place at Manchester United's home ground, Old Trafford.

Players including Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy and Micah Richards will be hoping to make up for being beaten 2-0 by pre-tournament favourites Brazil in their final warm-up match last Friday.

The only other events today are the other first-round men's football matches, including Egypt vs Brazil at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.

Gill
Hocquard-Drake, 47, who coaches youth teams at her home in Warminster, 
Wiltshire, and is a big fan of the women’s game, said: ‘They’re 
technically better than the men, probably because the pace is a bit 
slower.

‘They’re not such 
big drama queens either. If they get caught they just get back up and 
get back on with it.’ The crowd wasn’t the biggest women’s football has 
ever seen but it carried a distinct buzz.

There were chants of ‘Gee Bee, Gee Bee!’ No one ate all the pies. No one questioned whether the referee knew both her parents. There were only two yellow cards and no red ones.

As far as I could detect, no one felt the need to spit, swear, or aggressively challenge decisions that went against them. So there are clearly a few things the blokes can learn from these young women.

Newcomers to the sport might be surprised to see that they are not strapping great lasses. Some are barely over 5ft tall. Nor are they big money-earners.

Top players command only around £30,000 a year – it would take Chelsea and former England captain John Terry less than 36 hours to top that.

But now there’s some glory in which to bask. Team coach Hope Powell said: ‘We wanted them just to go out there and have fun. But they made history today, and that will never change now.’

Clearly, she needs some coaching in footy-speak at this level. What she meant, of course, is that the girls done well.
