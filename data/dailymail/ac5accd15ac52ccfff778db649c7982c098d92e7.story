'It absolutely must be defended': Tine Fey responded to the shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo today, saying it's a reminder of the importance of defending free speech 

Funny woman Tina Fey turned serious this morning when she was asked to weigh in on the tragic shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.

The attack, which has left a dozen dead so far, is believed to have been carried out by Muslim radicals furious with the publication's parody of the prophet Mohammed.

'Obviously, that news is terrible and tragic and upsetting,' Fey said Wednesday morning, at a television press event in Pasadena, California.

'You look at that and you look at the controversy surrounding The Interview, it makes you think about how important free speech is and how it absolutely must be defended.

'[We] cannot back down on free speech in any way. We all have to stand firm on the issue of free speech,' she said.

Both Charlie Hebdo's cartoons and The Interview have been criticized for their base humor, which some have argued is not worth the controversy they sparked.

But Fey says it doesn't matter the quality or type of humor, all speech should be defended no matter what.

'We’re Americans,and even if it’s dumb jokes in The Interview, we have the right to make them,' Fey said.

A reporter went on to ask Fey if she had ever felt pressure to censor herself when dealing with controversial topics.

She responded that she often dealt with such topics anchoring Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live.

'But even that was a different era, because in a social media era where you make a joke on American TV and it can go worldwide, it’s a different environment,' Fey detailed.

During her time writing and starring on long-running comedy 30 Rock, Fey also parodied the North Korean regime by casting actress Margaret Cho to play Kim Jong-il, current DPRK leader Kim Jong-un's father and ppredecessor

Fey spoke on the first day of the Television Critics Association winter tour in order to promote her new series on Netflix, Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt.
