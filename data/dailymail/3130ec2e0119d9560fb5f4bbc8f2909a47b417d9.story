A Lancashire supermarket chain has been forced to clear its shelves of monkey nuts - because the label doesn't state that the packet contains nuts.

Booths Food, Wine and Grocery has withdrawn its Whole Hearted Roasted Monkey Nuts and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued an Allergy Alert.

The company is concerned the label doesn't state the packet contains peanuts, putting those allergic to them at risk.

Booths Food, Wine and Grocery has withdrawn its Whole Hearted Roasted Monkey Nuts, because the presence of peanuts is not declared on the label

The withdrawn product is Booths Whole Hearted Roasted Monkey Nuts, 350g, best before July 12, 2013.

A spokesperson for the FSA said: 
'The reason for the withdrawal is that the packaging does not state the 
product contains peanuts, which is a specific allergen that’s listed in 
legislation.

'People who are allergic to peanuts 
may not be allergic to other types of nuts. The product’s packaging is 
transparent, but the nuts are still in the shells i.e. sold as monkey 
nuts rather than specifically as peanuts.

The FSA added: ‘EH Booths has withdrawn the product with the above date code from sale.

‘Customer notices will be displayed in stores, alerting customers to the reason for the withdrawal.

‘The company will also contact the relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members of the withdrawal.

‘Customers with an allergy to peanuts are advised not to eat this product but to return it to the nearest EH Booths store for a full refund.

‘No other EH Booths products are known to be affected.’

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued an Allergy Alert - as the nuts pose a health risk to people allergic to peanuts

'Without the correct information on the packaging, people with an allergy to peanuts - who might not know or make the connection between peanuts and monkey nuts, for example children - might eat the product and experience an adverse reaction.'

Booths said it takes the accurate labelling very seriously.

Technical manager, Waheed Hassan, alerted the FSA to this error immediately as well as posting notices in all Booths stores.

‘It is our responsibility as retailers to accurately record allergy advice, and in this instance, we felt a responsibility to recall the product and issue a notice to our customers who might suffer from a specific peanut allergy,’ he said.

It is the second product the company has had to withdraw within weeks.

Last month, the store withdrew some of its Edamame Bean Stir Fry because it contained soya.

The news comes just two weeks after the Food Standards Agency announced that Thorntons had been forced to withdrawn three varieties of its jars containing chocolate Smiles after pieces of glass were found inside them.

The confectioners said small pieces of glass had been found in the 135g and 350g milk chocolate jars and the 135g pink chocolate jar.
