The chances are you know a friend or family member who has moved abroad.

But if you make the effort to stay in touch regularly, then apparently you are in the minority.

A new study has revealed that although more than half of British people have close family or friends living in other countries around the world, only 34 percent say they keep in regular contact with them.

British parents revealed their top three favourite ways of staying in touch with their sons and daughters, which are online VOIP services

The research, carried out by international calling app ringo.co, showed that on average Britons have 13 close family or friends abroad.

The top five destinations for British emigrates are Australia, accounting for 22 percent, followed by America with 19 per cent, Canada with 13 percent and New Zealand with nine percent.

The top reason stated for not keeping in contact with parents, children, cousins, aunts and uncles, grandparents and best friends was the difficulty negotiating different time zones.

A total of 26 per cent of the 2,006 people questioned in the survey said this was the main reason for not keeping up regular contact.

The high cost of calling abroad was a factor for 18 per cent of people, while family and friends simply not being available to scheduled calls accounted for 14 per cent of people.

British parents also revealed their top three favourite ways of staying in touch with their children.

Online VOIP services was the most popular method, favoured by 35 per cent of people.

A traditional landline closely followed, with 34 percent of people preferring picking up the phone.

Texting was the top method of contacting relatives and friends for 32 percent of those questioned.

Surprisingly, 14 percent of Britons said they still post letters abroad, making old-fashioned mail more popular than social networking site Twitter which was used by just eight percent.

Even more surprisingly, younger Brits aged between 18-34 were found to be almost twice as likely to send  mail than the over-55s.

There were 21 per cent of children living abroad who say they speak to their parents every week.  

The study was commissioned after a United Nations report released in July this year showed that number of Britons living abroad has soared in the last decade to top five million for the first time.

Official data revealed where people born in the UK have chosen to settle, with a quarter emigrants jetting halfway around the world to live in Australia and four settling in San Marino.

Cheap flights, more open borders and the need to find work in the wake of the financial crash mean more people live outside the country they were born in than ever before.

In 1990 the figure was only 4.1m, meaning an increase of 23 per cent.

Australia was the most popular destination, with 1.277million expats, well ahead of the US where 758,919 Britons live and Canada, home to 674,371.

Spain remains the most popular European country to live in for Brits, followed by Ireland, Germany and Italy.

'With more than half of Brits now having friends and family living abroad, there is huge demand for a low-cost and effective way of keeping in touch,' said a spokesman for ringo.co.

'However, a lot of us worry about whether or not we'll be calling our loved ones at an unpleasant hour and about the unknown expense of making long-distance calls.

'With the introduction of our live time zone and billing information, Ringo.co hopes to eliminate these worries and encourage people to keep in touch with friends and family as much as they'd like.'
