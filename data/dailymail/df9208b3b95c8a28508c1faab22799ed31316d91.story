Great Britain won its first women's Olympic hockey medal in 20 years this afternoon, beating New Zealand 3-1 in the bronze medal match before a packed and partisan crowd at the Riverbank Arena.

The Duchess of Cambridge was in the stands to applaud the three goals, all of which came from penalty corners in the second-half.

The bronze matched Britain's only previous medal, won at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and also achieved the minimum target for the team prior to the Games.

The team had to quickly lift themselves following the disappointment of defeat to Argentina in Wednesday's semi-final and controlled the first-half without converting any of their chances.

The Kiwis struck a post a minute into the second-half but fell behind in the 45th minute when Reading striker Alex Danson deflected in a pass from captain Kate Walsh for her fifth goal of the tournament.

Walsh's presence in the team was remarkable in itself, after she had a plate inserted in a fractured jaw sustained in GB's opening match with Japan. The Reading defender continued to play through the tournament.

Walsh's defensive partner Crista Cullen doubled the lead with a well-placed drag-flick penalty corner in the 59th minute and Sarah Thomas deflected another corner into the goal four minutes later.

The Kiwis, whose previous best Olympic placing was sixth, pulled back a goal from Stacey Michelsen with a penalty corner deflection with just two minutes left.

But GB's victory was never in doubt and the squad soaked up the appreciation of the crowd on a lap of honour at the end.

The bronze medal took Britain's medal tally to 56 - 25 golds, 15 silvers and 16 bronzes.

Speaking afterwards, Cullen believed the team's success will leave a lasting legacy.

'We want this to be a legacy,' she said.

'We want it to encourage more people to play hockey. We don't get much TV coverage or opportunities for people to see us so we hope this will change things.'

A few hours later the Netherlands retained their women's Olympic field hockey title with a 2-0 win over world champion Argentina at Riverbank Arena.

The Dutch scored off two second-half penalty corners to join Australia as the only three-time Olympic champions.

The final was riveting until Carlien Dirkse van den Heuvel scored from a rebound of Eva de Goede's corner in the 40th minute.

Then the Dutch turned rampant, and after captain Maartje Paumen had a corner saved, she didn't miss the next chance a minute later in the 54th.

Her 14th Olympic goal and third in London gave her sole possession of the overall record.

The two goals took the air out of the Argentines, who were seeking their first gold medal.
