Yankees manager Brian Cashman has been accused of leading a 'triple life', conducting an affair with at least two different women while he was still married and bragging to one of them during a drunken tryst: 'The Yankees control the universe and I control the Yankees.'

Caroline Meanwell, the mother of Louise Neathway - one of Cashman's alleged mistresses - filed an explosive lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday accusing the baseball manager of being a 'manchild' who conspired to have his former lover committed so the 
affair would never be revealed.

The explosive suit also accuses Cashman of using scare tactics to force Meanwell into helping him, his lawyer and her daughter's therapist - who are referred to as 'The Gang' - and to turn against Neathway with the sole purpose of discrediting her.

'The Gang’s plan, while shocking and 
outrageous, seemed to be concocted and executed by the Three Stooges 
rather than a physician, a law firm and a sports executive,' the suit 
claims.

Brian Cashman, left, got her pregnant and made her have an abortion. He tried to discredit her by having her committed, a lawsuit says

Cashman's attorney Eric Creizman told 
Meanwell that the only three options left for her daughter were that, 'She 
will be committed, she will be arrested' or 'she will commit suicide and end
up dead.'

The suit alleges that Creizman put the
emphasis on 'and end up dead' as an ominous warning so that Meanwell 
would cooperate with them.

They are then accused of giving her a script to read to a 911 dispatcher so police would be 
sent to Neathway’s Tribeca apartment to institutionalize her.

The call was deemed unnecessary by all first responders.

The suit also claims that Cashman was 
at one stage leading a 'triple life', and Louise Neathway, 36, ended her months-long
affair with him when she learned there was at least one other woman and that he had 
no intention of divorcing his wife.

The suit says: 'When it became 
apparent Louise no longer wished to continue in a relationship with him,
Cashman started on a quest to destroy her reputation.'

Cashman’s wife, Mary, filed for divorce soon after Neathway was arrested in February 2011. They came to an amicable agreement and settlement last year.

The suit charges: 'His adulterous behavior turned his 
whole world upside-down. In the United Kingdom, 
such behavior of Cashman would fall under the old English term of 
"Manchild" - a male adult who in a child-like way attempts to skirt 
responsibility for his own malfeasance while blaming others.'

During the alleged affair, 
British native Neathway was having trouble in the family court system 
after losing custody of her daughter.

On a drunken night together at the
36-year-old's apartment, Cashman bragged to her that he could use his 
power as Yankee's manager to help her, according to the suit.

'One evening Cashman, after several 
glasses of wine, nuzzled up to Louise on her rooftop and in a seductive 
manner, whispered in her ear...that the Yankees control the universe and
that he controls the Yankees and that he would help her custody 
battle.'

Lawyer: Eric Creizman ominously warned Caroline Meanwell that Louise would 'end up dead', according to the suit

On 
January 27, 2012, during a predawn call to Meanwell, Cashman - who is described in the suit as 'petulant 
and frenzied' - allegedly admitted he had hacked into his former lover's 
email account and tried to convince the mother he had nothing more than a 
'one-night stand' with Louise

It was only after this call - which left Meanwell a 'nervous wreck' - she agreed to go to the office of Eric Creizman to meet 'The Gang'.

While there, Cashman admitted he had spoken with Louise's psychiatrist Charlotte Murphy numerous 
times, who agreed she was a danger to herself.

Murphy allegedly verified 
this on the phone during that meeting.

It was then that they, and another lawyer Caroline Polosi, provided Meanwell with a pre-written script to recite to the 911 operator.

When first responders found Louise to 
be no danger to herself or others, Creizman changed tactics and tried to
persuade Meanwell to involuntarily institutionalize her daughter, 
according to the suit.

When this failed, the Yankee's boss allegedly turned his attention towards having Neathway arrested.

'Cashman was not pleased with Creizman's unsuccessful stewardship in the attempted "take down" of Louise.

'He upped the ante and now was seeking to have her incarcerated', the suit says.

Louise was then arrested in February of last year and charged with grand larceny, stalking and harassment.

Prosecutors accused her of harassing Cashman with hundreds of 
text messages, and demanding he give her $15,000 to pay for an 
unspecified medical procedure.

Neathway later claimed that she was pregnant with his child and that he told her to have an abortion.

Cashman, Creizman and Charlotte Murphy did not respond to requests by MailOnline for comment.

Meanwell's lawyer: Peter Gleason, who filed the suit, said Cashman wanted to discredit his former lover before the affair was revealed  

Around the time of her arrest, the 
New York Daily News also obtained a reference letter Cashman wrote for 
Neathway on Yankees letterhead.

In
the letter dated July 15, 2011, Cashman said that he had known her for 
six years through charity work and described her as 'tireless' 
contributor who had the 'respect and admiration' of her colleagues.

In court, Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a 
married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a 
medical sales worker, and he
turned on her when it ended badly'.

She
is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that 
she had a year-long affair with the Yankees boss, which she ended after he did not
fulfill the promise to leave his wife and when she found out there were other women.

Louise was subsequently released from Rikers Island prison in July after her mother paid the $300,000 bond package.

Under the terms of her release, she must wear an ankle monitor and live at her mother’s home in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

Caroline Meanwell's lawyer Peter Gleason said of the case: 'I am shocked and outraged how the system has twisted and maligned Miss Neathway, when the biggest issue here is an adulterous act at the hands of a very powerful sports executive.'
