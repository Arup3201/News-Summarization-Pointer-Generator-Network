The star Ukip candidate accusing her party’s general secretary of being a sex pest was last night exposed as a fantasist.

Natasha Bolter’s claim of a top degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University unravelled when the institution took the rare step of denying she had ever attended.

And the Mail has learnt she even misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39.

Natasha Bolter, middle, the star Ukip candidate accusing her party’s general secretary, Roger Bird, of being a sex pest was last night exposed as a fantasist.

It casts doubt on her story that she was sexually harassed by Roger Bird, one of Nigel Farage’s key lieutenants.

Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’

But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’

Yesterday it emerged she sent him flirty text messages two days after the harassment claims were made. One said: ‘Love or infatuation made me lose my brain.’

She was a dream candidate for male-dominated Ukip because she is female, the daughter of immigrants and a former Labour supporter. But she exploded a grenade in the party by claiming in The Times that Mr Bird had propositioned her at his club.

On Monday, Ukip said Mr Bird had been suspended while it looked at claims of ‘impropriety’.

At Ukip’s September conference, Mr Bird introduced Mrs Bolter, saying: ‘She got five A grades at A-levels and went on to read PPE at Wadham College, Oxford.’

Roger Bird said he was in a relationship with Mrs Bolter, who denied she had slept with him. 

She repeated the Oxford claims in an unpublished interview with The Times, it is understood. But the university said it could find no evidence Mrs Bolter – then Natasha Ahmed – was a student. It said: ‘Oxford University has no record of a Natasha Ahmed with a birthday of 12 July 1975.’

Last night a friend said she did study in Oxford – on a teaching course at the now-defunct Westminster Institute of Education at Oxford Brookes University.

The discrepancy echoes the case of Jeffrey Archer, who once claimed to be an Oxford graduate when in fact he attended an education college linked to the main university.

On Newsnight, Mrs Bolter said she quit Ukip and walked away from a winnable seat to speak out about Mr Bird, adding that doing so ‘ruined my life’.

In her first television interview since the row, the single mother of five said she never ‘felt scared’ of Mr Bird because ‘he was a gentleman’, but spoke out because he was ‘looking at me as a sex object’. She added: ‘I just felt pressured that if I did the right thing my career would go further and faster. If I had slept with him I would probably have had an easier time in Ukip.’

At a subsequent meeting, he asked her to go for dinner – and insisted on buying her a £169 Ted Baker dress because she was not dressed smartly, she said.

Mr Bird responded by saying the pair were in a relationship for seven weeks. He revealed a string of text messages he claimed she sent him – including one which read: ‘I love you and miss you and think you are sort of perfect.’

He has told friends he wants to be reinstated in his £75,000-a-year job and as Ukip candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster. His supporters claim Mrs Bolter’s ‘rambling’ appearance on Newsnight on Tuesday has vindicated him.

One said: ‘She didn’t do herself any favours . . . She claimed to have lodged a complaint about Roger on November 5, but some of the affectionate messages she sent him were sent after that – what does that say about her claims?

‘Roger just wants this dealt with so he can get on with his job. He recognises there is a process that has to be gone through, but it is important for everyone that it is dealt with quickly.’

Mr Bird is due to face a disciplinary hearing tomorrow, when he will be able to make his case.

Senior party figures have been ordered to keep quiet about the row in public. But parliamentary candidate Helena Windsor broke cover yesterday to support Mr Bird. She tweeted: ‘I can’t imagine a more unlikely sex pest.’

Mrs Bolter was unavailable for comment yesterday.

Ukip deputy chairman Neil Hamilton, who stepped in as candidate for Basildon South as Mrs Bolter quit, has withdrawn after a party committee queried his expenses claims for travel and accommodation in his wife’s flat. The shamed former Tory MP, who was involved in the cash for questions scandal, could not be reached last night.
