Killed: A body found in a wooded area has been positively identified as Michaela Shunick, 21

Police have confirmed that decomposed remains found in a remote wooded area earlier this week belong to  Louisiana student Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, who vanished three months ago.

The Louisiana State University Faces Lab used medical and dental records to confirmed the body belonged to the missing girl.

Lafayette Police had said they 'strongly believed' the remains belonged to Shunick after they were found, alongside some clothing and jewelley, this week.

'Investigators have identified the body 
discovered in Evangeline Parish as that of Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick,' they confirmed in a statement on Friday. 'There will be no further comment on the Shunick 
investigation at this time.'

Police revealed they were led to her body by a tip, but would not say where it came from.

They followed a private road past a small cemetery of about 30 headstones and into a wooded area to the spot where the body was buried,Â ABC News reported.

Shunick's family told WBRZ that they can now begin the healing process, three months after the girl vanished as she cycled home from a friend's house.

They added that Shunick 'deserved a long and happy life filled with love and laughter'.

Scene: The badly decomposed body was found earlier this week next to jewellery and clothing

Grim discovery: Investigators were led to the wooded area in Lafayette by a detailed tip

Shunick, a student at the University of 
Louisiana-Lafayette, disappeared May 19, just days before she turned 22.

She 
was last seen riding away from a friend's house on black Schwinn 
bicycle, which was found in a swampy area at a highway exchange 25 miles
away.

Brandon Lavergne, a 33-year-old 
registered sex offender from Swords, has been charged with both her 
kidnapping and murder and with the 1999 death of Lisa Ann Pate.

Prosecutors said in court filings 
last week that Lavergne may have moved both bodies and that 'continued 
tampering' with Shunick's body was meant to hamper the investigation.

Last seen: The University of Louisiana at Lafayette student had left a friend's house to ride her bicycle home

St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby 
Guidroz said Lavergne's arrest came as his department helped Lafayette 
police search the sex offender's residence for evidence.

The search has been ongoing since July, but the sheriff had no details on what was
found.

The
rural St. Landry address where the search was conducted is listed as 
the address of Lavergne on the state's sex offender website.

The website says Lavergne was convicted in 2000 of aggravated oral sexual battery. He was released in 2008.

He
was reportedly on probation until 2010, and is listed as a Tier 3 sex 
offender, the most serious classification. Tier 3 offenders must 
register with the national sex offender registry for life, according to 
the sex offender website.

The University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette student had left a friend's house to ride her bicycle home on 
the day of her disappearance on May 19.

Her bicycle was found eight days 
later in a remote, swampy area under a highway bridge in Iberville 
Parish, about 25 miles from the spot where she was last seen.

Soon after her disappearance, 
Lafayette police released video taken about the time she went missing. 
It showed her cycling on a Lafayette street around 1.45am on May 19.

Investigators said at the time that they were seeking information about a pickup truck seen on the video.

The sex offender website shows a white 2011 Chevrolet Silverado under vehicles linked to Lavergne.

Reward: Her friends issued a 
$25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to her 
whereabouts

Best friends: Mickey and her sister, pictured in happier times before she went missing

Volunteers at the Find Mickey Shunick headquarters in the nearby South College Shopping Centre were told of the news last night.

Co-ordinator
Margaret Bearb said: 'It's almost like we all took a deep breath. This 
is the first time since this happened that the family has been able to 
take a breath.'

'I think it's more of a shock than anything else. We're on our 47th day, and here we are.'

And Shunick's sister, Charlie, told thetowntalk.com via text message that: 'We are relieved that the police have made an arrest.

'The
circumstances are pretty distressing. If she is gone, it is a void in 
the fabric of the world and a devastating blow to our family.'

Shine
a light: Friends and fellow students gathered to support Mickey's family in the search for her

According
to Louisiana law, first-degree murder includes 'the killing of a human 
being - when the offender has specific intent to kill or to inflict 
great bodily harm and is engaged in the perpetration of aggravated 
kidnapping'.

The law 
defines aggravated kidnapping as 'the forcible seizing and carrying of 
any person from one place to another; or the enticing or persuading of 
any person to go from one place to another; or the imprisoning or 
forcible secreting of any person.'

If
a district attorney seeks a capital verdict in a first-degree murder 
case, the crime can come with a sentence of death or life in prison.
