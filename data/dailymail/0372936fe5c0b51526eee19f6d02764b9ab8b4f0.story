Manchester United go to the Etihad hunting for three points as they take on Manuel Pellegrini's dishevelled Premier League champions. 

Here, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp gives his take on where the game could be won and lost.

ANGEL DI MARIA v PABLO ZABALETA

I’ll be covering the game for Sky and this is the battle I am most looking forward to watching. 

It’s an all-Argentine affair and whoever comes out on top will probably end up on the winning side. Di Maria has had two quiet games – Branislav Ivanovic and Andre Wisdom were very physical and frustrated him. 

Zabaleta will offer that but will want to take him the other way - he’s one of the best raiding right backs we’ve seen in the Premier League. This will be a brilliant contest and absolutely key in deciding the game.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE v MARTIN DEMICHELIS/ELIAQUIM MANGALA

That goal against Chelsea will give Van Persie confidence and he got good opportunities against one of the meanest defences in the league. 

He still has a lot to offer but if he gets involved in a physical battle with Vincent Kompany, there will be only one winner. Van Persie needs to target Demichelis/Mangala instead because that’s where he’ll get his success.

SERGIO AGUERO v CHRIS SMALLING

Manuel Pellegrini may go with one up front to get more numbers in midfield, but if that one is Sergio Aguero, United are in for a tough afternoon. 

Aguero played alone at Barcelona last season and as the lone striker against Tottenham two weeks ago he was sensational. United need to get numbers around him because he preys on weak links. 

Smalling had one of his best ever games for United against Chelsea last week. He’ll need another one on Sunday.
