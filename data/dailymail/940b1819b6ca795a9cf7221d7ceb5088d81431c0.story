A Florida man and his girlfriend allegedly broke into his parents' house and stole an iPad before killing a four-year-old Labrador while his child sat in the car.

Daniel Adams, 34, and Lauren Curran, 28, from Dundein, Florida, allegedly burgled the house as a 'cover-up' so they could poison the dog - because they believed it was a threat to their child and their own dog.

They were arrested after a devastated Alan and Laura Adams returned home to discover the animal, called Daisy, dead.

According to WPTV the pair admitted to killing the dog by using an 'intravenous needle filled with an unknown medication' when questioned. 

They added they took the iPad in a bid to make police believe someone else committed the crime.  

A spokesman for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office told the station there was no evidence that Daisy was dangerous. 

Adams and Curran were arrested Wednesday and charged with burglary, animal cruelty and child neglect.
