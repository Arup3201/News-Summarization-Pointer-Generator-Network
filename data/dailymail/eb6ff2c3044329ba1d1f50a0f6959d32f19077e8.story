Security staffing and reports of suspicious packages have increased across transportation and tourist sites across America while jittery travelers are changing travel plans as terror fears pervade the country.

Authorities, particularly in major 
cities, are operating on heightened alert in the wake of the Boston 
marathon bombings - with a rash of suspicious packages being reported.

Longer airport security lines were reported by travelers across the 
country today who said increased screening and luggage checks were in force.

Individual airports were not reporting major delays but told passengers to arrive early 'given the circumstances.'

Evacuated: Oklahoma City's City Hall and the surrounding six blocks were evacuated today

Security: Police presence has increased at public landmarks and on transport systems across the country. Police officers patrolled the Yankee stadium before the game with the Arizona Diamondbacks yesterday

Delays: Tourists reported delays and increased screening in major airports across the country today

A spokesman for the New York Port Authority which oversees city's airports as well as Newark Airport said: 
'I've not been told of any unusual delays today but we recommend 
passengers arrive with extra time given everything that is going on.

'There is no specific guideline but given such circumstances get there a 
little early.'

The TSA were referring all questions on additional 
security procedures in place to the Department for Homeland Security who were 
unavailable for comment. 

All security and major public agencies are feeling the pressure given Monday's events.

Public awareness of the heightened security situation means a higher than normal reporting rate of suspicious packages and behavior, while authorities work under a high security protocol. 

Downtown Seattle was closed due to a 
backpack abandoned on a sidewalk and New York City Police Department 
fielded 77 reports of suspicious packages in less than 24 hours.

Some tourists decided to change their U.S. travel plans over fears.

DialaFlight said they were working with customers.

'We are also going through every airline policy regarding refunds or 
alterations to their routes, and are actively contacting airlines who 
have yet to release a policy to find out what can be done for our 
clients,' they said.

Delta, American  and British Airways all announced they would waive cancellation fees this week.

Virgin Atlantic said it would not do so as it has received no cancellation requests, according to Skift.com.

An American Airlines spokesman told Mail Online that the airline had received no increase in cancellations but were offering the fee waiver as a good will gesture.

Kimberly Bolduc, marketing manager for Boston's main coach operator Peter Pan said two groups cancelled bus charter trips planned to arrive in the city tomorrow, according to MassLive.com.

Hotels in major U.S. cities also reported increased security while visitors said they were repeatedly being asked for evidence they were customers.

'Very large man in shiny black suit ostentatiously checking card keys before allowing access to room elevators,' one business traveler in Chicago told Business Journals. 'Wasn't there last night. Effective security theater.'

The owner of the Doubletree by Hilton
hotel in Times Square which also operate the Boston Marriott Long Wharf
also said they were taking additional precautions.

'We
are taking all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure the safety of 
our guests across our portfolio,' Ken Cruse, CEO of Sunstone Hotel 
Investors said.

Subway
systems in major cities were also introducing tougher security checks 
with authorities warning of increased bag searches and requesting 
greater vigilance from the public to report suspicious behavior.

In New York, authorities deployed 
so-called critical response teams - highly visible patrol units that move
in packs with lights and sirens - along with more than 1,000 counter terrorism officers.

Highly trafficked areas like the 
Empire State building, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, the 
United Nations and the World Trade Center site were being especially 
monitored.

At
New York's JFK airport and Seattle airport long lines were reported this morning with 
travelers saying officials were double checking boarding passes.

Meanwhile passengers took to Twitter.

Brian Stelter wrote: 'Noticeably tougher security at JFK this morning. Long lines, double-checks of boarding passes. No gripes from passengers while I was there.'

Daniel
Cohen wrote: 'Longest security lines at the airport since just after 
9/11. Glad to see TSA tightening up, but why did that ever stop.'

Jen
Spall wrote on Twitter: 'Not surprisingly TSA on alert this am but not 
singled out today. Very long lines at Sea-Tac. Mu flight continues to 
Maui without me.'

Others traveling into the U.S. reported similar issues.

Sofia Hellstrom said: 'Crazy security checks at Geneva Airport to New York flight.'

Dervla Kelly wrote: 'Nervous moment at Ottawa airport as bags abandoned in seat beside me and bomb dog brought in.'

The complaints came after security scares were reported across the country.

Six blocks of Oklahoma City were evacuated this morning after a stolen U-Haul truck was discovered outside City Hall. The
vehicle was found to be empty.

A terminal at New York's LaGuardia 
Airport was evacuated following the report of two bottles 
full of a suspicious liquid yesterday.

And a U.S. Airways flight flying into 
Boston from Philadelphia was pulled off the runway
and its luggage searched after security realized a suitcase had not 
been checked.

In a worrying sign for racial tension following the attacks - whose perpetrators are yet to be identified -  a plane scheduled
to depart Logan airport was evacuated after a man alerted authorities 
of two passengers speaking Arabic.

The American
Airlines flight was flying out of Boston to Chicago.

The horrific reminder of the terror danger facing the U.S. will no doubt increase scrutiny over the TSA's already 
controversial plan to allow some pocket knives on flights.

However, politicians wanted to reinforce the message was of vigilance but also a refusal to be cowed by terrorists.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said: 'We are 
asking all New Yorkers to remain vigilant in the days ahead.'

'If you see 
something that looks strange, just pick up the phone and say something. 
But at the same time, we refuse to let cowardly acts of violence stop us
from living in our city, the city that we love.'
