Two junior hockey league players were arrested this week on child pornography charges stemming from an illicit meeting with a 15-year-old girl in a Minnesota hotel room.

On Monday, Lincoln Stars players Thomas Ryan Carey and Brandon Nicholas Smith, both 19, were charged with use of a minor in a sexual performance as well as possession and dissemination of child pornography.

A 15-year-old girl from Moorhead has accused the two men of videotaping her having sex, and then sending the video to several friends.

The unidentified victim says she connected with Carey, who attended her school, on Facebook about a week before he played a hockey game in town.

On Valentine's Day, the victim and a girlfriend met with Carey and his hockey friends at the local Days Inn motel after a game against the Fargo Force.

The victim told police detectives that she had sex with Carey in one of the motel rooms, while Smith was present.

Two days later, she started receiving text messages from other hockey players and girls saying 'nice video'.

She suspected Smith took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video.

Carey subsequently sent the victim the footage which showed her nude and a male body part.

Detectives subsequently interviewed both men in Nebraska. Smith stuck by his story and said it was Carey who took the video of his liaison with the victim.

But Carey said it was his friend who did the videotaping during his interview.

Carey told investigators that both he and Smith had sex with the girl and that she was agreed to the film.

Smith at first denied sending the video to anyone other than Carey, but later admitted he sent it to one Moorhead High School student.

The victim's female friend, who accompanied her to the motel that night, also talked with investigators and says she too received the video.

A hockey player in Pennsylvania said he received an image of Smith and the victim and told her the photo was 'going around'

Both were handed the felony charges on Monday and will return to Clay County District Court on July 10.

Carey's defense attorney Jade Rosenfeldt says they plan to fight the allegations.

'This is not the type of case for which the child pornography statues were intended, and as more information comes to light it will be apparent that this is a case involving consensual behavior and consent to photos and videos being involved,' she said in a statement.

Both young men have been suspended from their team pending the legal investigation for violating the U.S. Hockey League code of conduct.

Their status on the team will be decided once the legal process is over.
