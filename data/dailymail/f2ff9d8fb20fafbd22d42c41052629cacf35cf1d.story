Cider is fast becoming the drink of choice as traditional lager drinkers change their tipple.

The fact was long ago predicted by master brewer Jean-Pierre Stassen who claims his brewery in Aubel, Belgium, was first to produce flavoured ciders, adding peach in 1987, later cherry, lychee and raspberry.

'At the time, other companies said it was crazy, it was sacrilege ... but people bought it'.

Trips to the pub are becoming less 
frequent, but consumers are willing to pay more for premium products, 
such as independent craft beer and ciders such as Strongbow Gold when they do 
venture out.

Retail analysts Mintel said forty-seven
per cent of drinkers said they regularly enjoy a glass of cider compared
with 46 per cent who describe themselves as lager fans

'Mass-produced beers have suffered due to the surge of craft beers, Spiros Malandrakis, senior drinks analyst at market 
research group Euromonitor, told Reuters.

'Big brewers feel the threat. Cider could be the 
escape hatch.'

Cider's
rebirth in Britain has been going strong since C&C Magners took off
in 2005, and 
resold the drink's image as a refreshing summer beverage poured over ice.

As proof of the threat felt by traditonal lager producers, Stella Artois now sells its own cider, Cidre.

New
flavours such as pear and elderberry have widened its appeal to the 
point where it's considered an ideal all-year-round drink.

Retail analysts Mintel said forty-seven
per cent of drinkers said they regularly enjoy a glass of cider compared
with 46 per cent who describe themselves as lager fans.

The
fact it is sweeter – more like fizzy soft drinks – means it appeals to 
young adults who might have bought alcopops in the past, said Mintel

Its surveys of drinkers 
found 58 per cent thought cider more refreshing than lager.

The
fact it is sweeter – more like fizzy soft drinks – means it appeals to 
young adults who might have bought alcopops in the past, said Mintel. 
Cider also has ‘a strong appeal to women’.

Mintel
said: ‘Half say it has a fresher taste, 44per cent prefer its sweeter 
taste, 27per cent drink it for a change and one in five claim its less 
gassy than lager - something which appeals to women especially. 

‘Revealingly,
one in six consumers say that they like that it tastes less alcoholic 
than lager, which reflects the desire among younger consumers, new to 
drinking, to have a more palatable drinking option.

‘While cider is drunk mainly by men, 
it also has a strong appeal to women and this gives it a considerable 
advantage in the in-home-focused alcohol market where ‘shareability’ 
between the genders has become a key benefit.

‘Refreshment
and freshness in cider are especially popular among over-35 drinkers, 
whereas under-35s have been most attracted by cider’s variety of sweet 
flavours.’

While
Britain represents almost half of the 1.8 billion litres of cider drunk
globally last year, the United States is virtually untouched territory. In a country with five times more people, the U.S. drank 15 times less 
cider but this is rapidly changing.

Cider is being marketed as a healthier alternative - made from apples and free from 
gluten - and appealing to the sweet-toothed of young America.

'Ten years ago, no one would have expected craft beer to have risen so 
much. We think in cider similar things can happen,' said Joris Brams, 
director of C&C's international operations.

Cider was a mainstream drink in the United States before German 
immigrants established large-scale lager production in the mid-19th 
century, but it fell away after the prohibition era.
