Almost 60 families have been left without school places for their children after a council scrapped a new primary school just six weeks before it was due to open.

Furious families blasted ‘shambolic’ Bromley Council after offering them places at the brand new Harris Primary Academy in Beckenham, south-east London, in April - only for councillors to block the school from opening last week.

The school, which was hoped to meet the strong demand for primary places in the area, was due to be built on the site of an existing senior school in an exclusive residential street where the average house price is nearly £2million.

Two temporary classrooms were to be placed on the site for September, allowing reception classes for children aged four and five, who would enter a newly-built permanent school constructed on the site the following year.

But local residents had complained the school’s temporary single-storey classrooms, which would be situated behind high hedges and at least 65ft (20m) from the nearest house, would create ‘light pollution’.

One parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The situation is shambolic. Peter Dean, one of the councillors who denied planning permission, has already admitted to parents in an email that he didn’t know the council had offered us places there. And this man is vice-chairman of the committee.

‘And despite admitting he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he’s still deemed able to make a decision that has ruined these kids’ start in life.’

Mother Polly Sell added: ‘It was Bromley Council that offered us the places, there was no caveat that the school would not go ahead on the admissions form - which there were for some schools.

'How can the council give with one hand and take away with another? At the very least it makes Bromley Council look - for want of a much stronger word – disjointed'

‘How can the council give with one hand and take away with another? At the very least it makes Bromley Council look - for want of a much stronger word - disjointed.’

Another parent said: ‘I would like to know why councillors feel the interests of a few wealthy residents are more important than the education of the children of 60 families who they also have a responsibility towards.’

The families, many of whom had already spent almost £100 on new Harris Academy uniforms, including official school bags and coats, have been told they will not find out where their children will be placed until September – days before the new term begins.

Councillor Richard Scoates, Chairman of the Planning Sub-Committee said: ‘As permission was being sought for 120 pupils and over 80 additional parking spaces, the Committee noted that the application would have represented a cramped and substantial intensification of use of the site. 

'The Committee rejected the application because of this and the increased traffic generation and parking pressure.’

A Bromley Council spokeswoman said they would be looking to relocate all of the children, but admitted there were no spaces left in any Beckenham schools.

The councillors who voted against the school – Russell Mellor, Michael Turner, Simon Fawthrop, Peter Dean, Samaris Huntington-Thresher, Melanie Stevens and Vanessa Allen – all declined to respond to a MailOnline request for comment.
