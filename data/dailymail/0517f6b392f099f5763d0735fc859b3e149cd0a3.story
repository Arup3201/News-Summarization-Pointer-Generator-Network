A piece of memorabilia from the historic Apollo 15 mission to the moon in 1971 has sold for more than half a million dollars, fetching the highest price ever for a piece of NASA equipment at a public auction.

The joystick controller used by astronaut David Scott to land the spacecraft 43 years ago sold for for $610,064 to an unidentified online bidder on Thursday night, space history website Collect Space reported.

The hand-controlled joystick was one of more than 600 aeronautic and space exploration relics listed at the 7th Space and Aviation Autograph and Artifact Auction online sale by RR Auction of Boston.

Record: This hand controller used by the Apollo 15 crew to land on the Moon's surface in 1971 was sold to an unknown bidder on Thursday by RR Auction in Boston for $610,064, which is believed to be the highest price a NASA item has gone for

Apollo 15 was the ninth manned mission in the United States' Apollo program, the fourth to land on the Moon, and the eighth successful manned mission. It began on July 26, 1971, and ended on August 7

The Apollo 15 crewman optical alignment sight (COAS) was the second-biggest sale at the auction.

The rare COAS piece used for rendezvous, docking and star sightings was picked up for $126,180.

While the lunar module Falcon was intentionally crashed into the lunar surface following the moon landing, both pieces of equipment were removed beforehand, which is likely to have driven their prices up.

Scott, the seventh out of just 12 men to walk on the moon, personally saved the devices.

They had been part of his private collection up until the sale.

He and his crewmates, Jim Irwin and Al Worden, returned to Earth aboard the command module Endeavour.

'In many cases, items such as these were
 abandoned by the crew after use, or lost forever to history as 
disposable equipment when sent tumbling back to the lunar surface in the
 spent lunar module to be vaporized upon impact with the surface,' Bobby
 Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, said in a statement to Collect Space prior to the sale.

Scott wrote a two-page report confirming the authenticity of the equipment and explaining how they were used.

The report came went with the items for sale.

'Demand far outstrips supply for truly rare, and unique, lunar surface artifacts from the Apollo lunar landings, and these represent the pinnacle of Apollo-era flown material,' Richard Jurek, co-author of Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program, told Collect Space.

A law passed in 2012 confirmed the Apollo-era astronauts' title to the spacecraft equipment that they had brought back to Earth.

Mementos from other missions also garnered large sums at the auction.

A right-hand nylon 'comfort' glove that Buzz Aldrin flew to Tranquility Base on the first ever moon landing, Apollo 11 sold for $61,212.

The item was among 70 other pieces made available from the 1969 mission.

A checklist page Aldrin used on the lunar surface sold for $31,409.

A strap that held up the life support backpack that Charles 'Pete' Conrad wore on Apollo 12 sold for $52,649.

'These items represent the pinnacle of Apollo-era flown material,' Mr Jurek told CNN.

'While risking their lives during the most critical and historic phases of their mission, these are the items that the astronauts personally selected to retain as mementos from arguably the greatest technological and engineering achievement of the 20th century'

Much of the equipment used on NASA missions was either left on the moon or sent drifting into space

Many others have been donated to museums, making the value of those that were up for auction all the more higher.
