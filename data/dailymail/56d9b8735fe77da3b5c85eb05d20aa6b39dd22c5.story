Jim Davidson launched into a foul-mouthed rant at Bruce Forsyth, as well as saying Terry Wogan and Paul Daniels looked like silhouettes used in newspapers to illustrate suspected sex offenders

Controversial comic Jim Davidson launched into a foul-mouthed rant at Sir Bruce Forsyth and a string of other celebrities during a performance of his show about his Operation Yewtree arrest.

Davidson told his audience that Sir Terry Wogan and magician Paul Daniels reminded him of silhouettes used in newspapers to illustrate suspected paedophiles.

The former Generation Game and Big Break host continued his tirade of abuse, saying that veteran television host Bruce Forsyth was 'a f******* old b******' and asked: 'Is he dead yet?'

Davidson, 60, began the show by talking about his Operation Yewtree arrest in January last year for alleged historic sex offences against women.

He was not charged with any offence because of a lack of evidence. 

During his new stage show, called No Further Action, he claimed Yewtree detectives had gone 'a bit f******* bonkers' pursuing 'paedophiles and perverts', the Sunday Mirror reported. 

He then shocked theatre-goers by saying that the silhouettes used in newspapers all 'looked like Terry Wogan to me.'

He added: 'I can't bear him so I wanted it to be him. And Paul Daniels as well.'

Turning his attention to Sir Bruce, 86, Davidson said: 'I only used to watch Strictly in case he f****** dropped dead. When I took over the Generation Game he never even sent me a card.'

Davidson had earlier blasted the Doncaster Dome venue, refusing to use the dressing room and getting ready for the show in his car.

Before the performance, he tweeted: 'The dome is a dump it looks derelict. Dirty and awful. What shall i do?

'The show must go on ... Tweeting from dressing room.... My car,' he added. 

Chris Hone, from Doncaster Dome, said: 'We apologise to any customers who were offended by the disparaging tweets about the venue by the act who performed on Saturday.

'A number of issues were raised by the act with a member of the team, who then did everything in his power to ensure the visiting comedian was happy.'
