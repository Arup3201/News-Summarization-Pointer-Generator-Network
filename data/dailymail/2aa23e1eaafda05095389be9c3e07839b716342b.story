We were just getting over her steamy Burberry campaign alongside boyfriend Tom Sturridge earlier this year, but never one to take a break, Sienna Miller is back.

The actress and model is the star of Ford Mustang's latest campaign, which was shot by fashion industry heavyweight Rankin.

The 31-year-old looks toned in a cross-over black dress as she poses against the iconic red car.

Leaving her trademark boho style behind, she rocks a slicked back hair and minimal make-up as she poses behind the wheel and checks out her reflection in the mirror.

Sienna also stars in a short film to celebrate the arrival of the first Ford Mustang to ever be available in Europe.

Speaking about her latest work, she said: 'Every time I am in America I’ve always rented a 
Mustang to drive so I’m very excited it’s coming to Europe.

'It’s a 
completely iconic car and it’s beautiful in real life.'

Renowned photographer Rankin, who created the imagery and film to welcome the new car, said: 'The Ford Mustang is the ultimate boys car, growing up my dream was to get one. Now it’s in Europe I may have to make that a reality.'

The
 global reveal includes Mustang fastback and convertible models, which 
promise world-class levels of performance and refinement as well as a 
sleek design that retains the classic Mustang key design elements - 
Sienna not included.
