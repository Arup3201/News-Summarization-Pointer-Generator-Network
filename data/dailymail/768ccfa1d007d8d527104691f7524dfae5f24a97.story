They live together, play together and now they work together, too.

Supermodels Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse have joined forces to help unveil Burberry's AW14 collection.

The two British models, who are long-standing members of the Burberry family - Cara first featured in the SS11 ad campaign and Suki was last year's face of Brit Rhythm fragrance - are the luxury British brand's latest campaign stars.

The housemates are also joined by the likes of Malaika Firth, Callum Ball, Tarun Nijjer and Oli Green, making up the young British cast.

Work hard, play hard: Party loving models Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse are helping showcase the AW14 Burberry range (and newcomer Oli Green is repping the men)

Shot by Mario Testino (who else?), the campaign aims to reflect the artistic spirit of the collection, which features hand-painted techniques, monogrammed ponchos and the iconic Heritage trench coat.Â 

Speaking about the new campaign, Christopher Bailey, Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer of Burberry, said: 'A dynamic British cast brings the artistic spirit of the campaign to life with the iconic Burberry trench coat at its heart.'

Bailey first showcased the range at London Fashion Week in February when he sent out all his models - including Cara and Suki - wearing wool blanket 
ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, complete with the models' monogrammed initials.

Elsewhere,
 bold nature-inspired prints were emblazoned on dresses and silk 
scarves, silk cotton organdy dresses were hand painted, while flowers were painted on buttersoft shoes and bags.

The
 show, called The Bloomsbury Girls, took inspiration from the Bloomsbury set and Charleston, the country home 
and meeting place for the writers, painters and intellectuals who formed
 the group.

It was an 
explosion of rich, yet natural, colour: elderberry, cameo pink, 
blackcurrant, slate blue, antique rose, russet red ink blue, bottle 
green, burnt amber, olive, amethyst, larch yellow, camel, black 
amethyst... the list goes on. And soon, you'll be able to get your hands on it.

Cara, 21, and 22-year-old Suki were last seen together
cavorting in the lobby of their hotel in Cannes during the recent film 
festival.

There was no sign of
their respective partners; Suki is attached to Hollywood actor Bradley 
Cooper, 39, while Cara is reportedly still dating actress Michelle 
Rodriguez, 35.

Cara
 and Suki have been spending a lot of time together lately and carried 
on their party-loving lifestyle as they headed back to London over the 
weekend where they had a girls' night out with some of their other 
famous pals.

Making it a night to remember, Cara posted a photo of herself 
with Suki, model pal Mary Charteris, Selena Gomez, Georgia May Jagger and 
Katy Perry.

Earlier before the concert had started Cara posted another photo of the famous five with the caption 'Loving ladies night'.

Meanwhile, Suki has continued making her move from model to actress by landing a role in in the sci-fi sequel Insurgent.

The 22-year-old has joined the follow-up to the box-office hit Divergent.

The
 film series features Shailene Woodley, 22, and English actor Theo 
James, 29, in lead roles based on the young adult novels by 25-year-old 
writer Veronica Roth.
