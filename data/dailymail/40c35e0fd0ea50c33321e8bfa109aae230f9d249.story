They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks - but you can teach a sea lion to dance, scientists in California have proved.

Not only is Ronan the sea lion thought to be the first non-human mammal capable of keeping a beat, she has also turned out to be something of a Backstreet Boys fan.

Marine scientists successfully taught Ronan to bob her head in time to music - a skill previously thought to exist only in animals capable of vocal mimicry, such as cockatoos, and parrots - including the boy band's smash hit Everybody (Backstreet's Back).

She's got rhythm: Scientists have taught Ronan the sea lion to bob her head in time to music

Earth, Wind and Fire: Video footage shows Ronan enjoying the hits of the Backstreet Boys and classic disco tracks from the 1970s

Incredible - and comical - video footage shows Ronan bobbing her head in perfect time with the track. She has also displayed a fondness for 1970s disco classics, particularly Boogie Wonderland by Earth, Wind and Fire.

Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, trained the three-year-old sea lion to move in time to a hand signal, which was later replaced by a simple, non-musical sound signal. Ronan was rewarded with a fish everytime she bobbed her head to the varying rhythmic sounds.

The team varied the type and speed of the sounds they used to confirm that Ronan was actually following the beat.

Researchers used two computer-generated ticks - similar to a metronome - to establish that Ronan wasn't simply bobbing her head in response to the previous beat. Ronan followed the beat even when a continuous metronome was replaced with one that skipped a beat, scientists said.

The team then introduced Ronan to 
musical 'dance' lessons, starting her off with a simplified section of Down On The Corner by Creedence Clearwater Revival, before introducing some pop into the 
mix with the Backstreet Boys and Earth, Wind and Fire.

Without any prior exposure to the 
tracks, Ronan stunned scientists by bobbing to the beat of all of the 
songs over the course of multiple trials.

The musically-inclined mammal could 
also keep time with five different tempos of Boogie Wonderland, 
according to the study, which was published yesterday in the American 
Psychological Association's Journal of Comparitive Pyschology.

Not only did Ronan's bobbing skills 
improve markedly over the course of the trials, they have lasted beyond 
the experiment, with the sea lion passing follow-up tests a few weeks 
after the final session with flying colours.

Peter Cook, a doctoral candidate at the Long Marine Lab at UCSC, said: 'Dancing is universal among humans, 
and until recently, it was thought to be unique to humans as well.

'When some species of birds were found to have a similar 
capability for rhythmic movement, it was linked to their ability to 
mimic sound. Now we're seeing that even mammals with limited vocal 
ability can move in time with a beat over a broad range of sounds and 
tempos.'

Study co-author Colleen Reichmuth, 
PhD, who is based at the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC, said: 
'Understanding the cognitive capabilities of animals requires carefully 
controlled, well-designed experiments.

'This study is particularly rigorous 
because it examines, step-by-step, the learning conditions that 
supported the emergence of this complex behaviour.'

Fan: The Backstreet Boys' track Everybody (Backstreet's Back) is among Ronan the sea lion's favourites

In 2011 footage of Snowball the cockatoo bobbing up and down and shaking its feet to pop music swept the internet.

The antics of the then 13-year-old bird - which was seen grooving to tracks by the likes of Queen, Lady Gaga, and - just like Ronan - the Backstreet Boys - was hailed by scientists as proof that humans are not the only creatures with a sense of rhythm.

While many animals had been known to respond to music, Snowball was the first documented case of an animal with the ability to keep to a rhythm.

Ronan the sea lion was rescued from Highway 1 in San Luis Obispo, and now calls the university's Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory home.
