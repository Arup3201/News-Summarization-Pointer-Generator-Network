It seems that sex and rock 'n' roll really are kindred spirits as new research reveals that rock music fans are most likely to pursue an affair.

Researchers questioned people who admitted to being adulterous on their music preferences and 41 per cent choose rock 'n' roll as their favourite genre.

The survey found that pop music came second with 16 per cent of cheating Brits citing it as their favourite music, country music received 11 per cent, classical music got 7 per cent, and rap and hip-hop received 2 per cent.

The research also found that 70 per cent of Brits wouldn't date someone who has 
vastly different music tastes to their own.

The rule doesn't apply if you're Irish though. Unlike England, Scotland and 
Wales, Irish affair seekers seem to favour country music (33per cent).

A spokesperson for IllicitEncounter.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'I am not surprised that rock 'n' roll music came out on top.

'Rock music has a long been associated with sexual appeal, risk taking and living life on the edge.

'Many of our members would have grown up under the influence of bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac and it is very possible that these songs have had an influence on their lifestyle.'
