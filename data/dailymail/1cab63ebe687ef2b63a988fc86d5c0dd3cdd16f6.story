The Duchess of Cambridge was as elegant as ever today in a claret LK Bennett coat while meeting military supporters, servicemen and women, as part of London Poppy Day.

However, the glossy mane that inspired a million Chelsea blow-dries looked rather different: silver roots were clearly visible along the parting of her normally chestnut hair. She's also gone for a less bouncy 'do than usual, parted in the middle, rather than at the side.

In fact, the flat, middle-parted style she's chosen highlights the silvery strands coming through at her hairline. Hairdresser Daniel Galvin Jr comments: 'If you are going grey, it is important to part your hair where the grey does not show.'

Rebelling: However, Professor Beard said the Duchess occasionally rebels against her public image - as can be seen in this photograph taken last year, which shows streaks of grey in Kate's usually immaculate tresses.

However, it appears Kate doesn't care who spots the silvers. And why should she? She's probably got more important things on her mind.

Many new mothers, like Kate, find that their hair changes after they give birth.

Greying hair is not normally directly associated with pregnancy, however, any form of stress can encourage it and can be a side effect of being pregnant or giving birth.

'If, when pregnant, you use an anaesthetic grey hairs may develop. It’s a huge shock to the system sometimes sends the hair bulb to sleep causing the hair to loose its natural pigmentation,' explains Galvin Jr.

'In my experience many pregnant women whose hair turns grey will start seeing their natural pigmentation come through within a few months.'

Sources say that the Duchess had, to her horror, started finding the odd 
grey hair (‘stress highlights’, her friends joke) before her pregnancy

However, it seems more likely that 
Kate's has been getting lighter for the last few years - common among 
those with dark hair - and has simply decided not to cover it up.

Indeed, impeccably placed sources have whispered that the Duchess had, to her then horror, started finding the odd 
stray grey (‘stress highlights’, her friends joke) before her pregnancy.

To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during 
regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair And Metrospa in 
Chelsea.

Evidently, Kate 
has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers, even royal ones, can
 spare four hours at the salon when they've got a four-month-old to look 
after.

'Going grey marks nature’s way of softening the hair colour
giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says Galvin Jr. 'I always
recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend
the grey hair and tone it down slightly.'

However, Kate may want to 
avoid any unnecessary chemicals: it could be that she's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant 
or breastfeeding.

Many women stop colouring their hair 
during pregnancy, with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of
 their baby to begin again. This is for fear of the
 chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through
breast-feeding.

This time last year, pictured above, Kate's hair was noticeably darker, and parted at the side

However, the NHS says new mothers needn't avoid the salon:
'The chemicals in permanent and semi-permanent hair dyes are not highly 
toxic. Most research, although limited, shows that it’s safe to colour 
your hair while pregnant.

'Some studies have found that very high doses of the chemicals in hair dyes may cause harm. However, these doses are massive compared to the very low amount of chemicals a woman is exposed to when colouring her hair.'

Celebrity hair stylist Errol Douglas said: 'I recommend vegetable dye and colour glosses to my clients when they're expecting. They're safe and take them through those months with a gentle solution to keeping roots at bay.'

Often, women find their hair looks 
thicker and shinier during pregnancy but hormonal changes kick in after 
having a baby, as dermatologist Justine Hextall explains.

'Hair has three phases; growth, resting and shedding,' she says.

'Normally,
 hair grows at the same rate that it falls out. But under the influence 
of pregnancy hormones, more hairs remain in the growing phase, 
particularly during the second and third trimester, which is why women 
often notice hair becoming thicker as their pregnancy goes on.

'Usually, losing your hair after birth is just your hair going back to normal.'
