Surrounded by barbed-wire fencing and with police on guard 24-hours a day, this homeless Roma gypsy has found the safest place to set up camp in London.

These extraordinary pictures taken at Belgravia police station yesterday, appear to show a homeless man's tent pitched up right under the noses of the Met police.

It is not known how long the man has been living there, but no doubt officers have been left feeling red-faced by the revelation.

Safe as houses: A tent, believed to belong to a homeless gypsy man, has been spotted in the grounds of Belgravia police station

Cheeky: Under the cover of a large tree and behind metal fencing, the homeless man has found a prime location

Pitched up: It is not known how long the homeless man has been camping in the grounds of the station

Nestled against the wall of the station, the homeless man is away from traffic and sheltered beneath a large tree in the heart of SW1.

Police and council officials have faced an endless battle to keep Roma gypsies off the streets of central London in recent years.

Home sweet home: Police say the tent has since disappeared, but officers will be checking the spot regularly from now on

For the last two summers, nearby Park Lane has been inundated with unwanted visitors who have been blamed for a surge in begging, pickpocketing, shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.

Large
areas of grass are left strewn with rubbish, from suitcases to soiled 
blankets and half-eaten food, and bushes have been transformed into 
stinking open cesspools.

Nearby businesses, which include the Dorchester Hotel and a string of luxury car dealerships, are furious at the mess.

Last month, twenty-one Romanians were given a free flight home on the condition that they went straight to Heathrow.

The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline the tent outside Belgravia police station has since disappeared.

But
a spokesman said in light of these pictures, officers will be keeping a sharp 
lookout to see if the homeless man returns from now on.

He added: 'There is no tent outside Belgravia police station.

'Anyone seen 
camping in the location would be swiftly moved on by police and offered 
suitable accommodation with our partner, Westminster City Council. If 
any offences were identified, appropriate action would be taken.'

Battle: Police and council officials have been trying to evict Roma gypsies from central London all summer

Desperate: Police have even put Roma gypsies on free flights home in a bid to keep them out of the capital
