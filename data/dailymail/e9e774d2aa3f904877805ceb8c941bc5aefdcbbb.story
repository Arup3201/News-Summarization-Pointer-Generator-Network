Joe Biden considers himself to be part of America’s middle class, despite his $379,000 income.

Speaking to the National Council of La Raza in Las Vegas about home ownership, the vice president said that the upper class ‘doesn’t get it – for middle class folks like me and you, owning a home is the single most consequential element to our existence.’

President Obama has been heavily campaigning his $250,000 threshold that would cause income taxes to rise for the wealthy.

Critical: Biden was quick to criticize Mitt Romney for lacking sound judgement

Mr and Dr Jill Biden, according to his 2011 tax return, made a little more than $307,000 in salary, has several trusts and annuities, and more than $24,000 in social security benefits. 

Dr Biden teaches English at Northern Virginia Community College, earning around $82,000 for classes taught at the Alexandria campus.

Much of the Obama administration’s re-election has been centred around making presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney appear aloof and out of touch with the struggles of middle-class Americans.

However, the median household income for Americans was $51,000, according to a February 2012 study by Sentier Research.

But as the White House Dossier notes, ‘If Biden feels he is middle class, it may be due to his apparent inability to manage his finances.’

The Dossier cites a December 2011 report by the Center for Responsive Politics, which claims that the vice president is a liability to Mr Obama’s cabinet, financially speaking, and could have negative assets.

Mr Biden makes $225,521 with his vice presidential salary, which combined with his wife’s salary and their combined assets equal $379,035, but has mortgages and home equity loans, as well as two lines of credit and a loan taken from his life insurance policy.

In his speech, Mr Biden slammed Mr Romney’s time at Bain Capital, saying the former Massachusetts governor lacked ‘sound judgment.’

Speaking on the housing crisis, he had said: ‘So many people, through no fault in their own, caught up in this crisis, because three neighbours in their development had a sub-prime mortgage, they went belly-up and all of a sudden they find their house, they are upside down.

'They did nothing wrong, they missed no payment. These guys don’t get it. For middle class folks like me and you, owning a home is maybe the single most consequential element to our existence.’
