The husband of a Chicago actress who was killed after being struck by a falling tree branch is suing the park where the accident occurred.

Molly Glynn, 46, a veteran of the Chicago stage who also appeared in notable television dramas, died in September after being struck by a tree while cycling on a forest preserve trail. 

She was caught in a storm along with husband and fellow actor Joe Foust.

Joe Foust is now suing the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.

Killed: Molly Glynn, a veteran of the Chicago stage and actress appearing in notable television dramas, died in September after being struck by a tree while cycling a forest preserve trail

Accident: Police arrived on scene to find actress Molly Glynn injured by the falling tree. She was pronounced dead the next day

Mr Foust filed the suit in Cook County Circuit Court on Thursday, alleging that the district was negligent in keeping 'diseased, defective, weakened' trees, which 'presented a risk of harm to persons using the bike path.'  

Mr Foust claims Cook County were negligent, alleging that the district failed to inspect, prune and maintain the trees and failed to warn people using the bike path that the trees were not safe. 

The suit also alleges that such a failure to inspect the trees was done 'with an utter indifference and conscious disregard for the safety of the public and Molly Anne Glynn.'

At the time of the accident, Mr Foust called 911 and police responded to the scene. Glynn died the following day in hospital. 

'She's gone,' Foust wrote on Facebook. 'I couldn't save her.' 

Stage star: Glynn, seen here with husband Joe Foust, regularly appeared in prestigious Chicago theater productions. Her husband is now suing the park where she died

Besides recognition across the Chicago theater community for her regular appearances on prestigious stages such as Steppenwolf, Writers, Next, Chicago Shakespeare, and Northlight, she gained national attention with television credits on shows like 'Boss' and 'Chicago Fire.'

'A beautiful woman and one would think that she would only be a leading 
lady, but the truth is she also had great skill and breadth and scope as
 an actress,' said Northlight Theater artistic director BJ Jones in a statement.  

Friends and family of the actress managed to raise $164,000 for her husband to pay for medical and funeral expenses, along with a support and trust fund for their two children.

Glynn was especially known for playing strong women.

One of her most impressive roles was as a wife dealing with her husband's infidelity in the 2003 Steppenwolf Garage production of 'Orange Flower Water.'

Theater critic Chris Jones singled Glynn out in a review of the 2012 production of 'Homecoming 1972' in which she played a waitress.

'Much of the acting is strong. Glynn, for example, takes that diner waitress, a tricky assignment indeed, and fleshes her out in all 
kinds of unexpected ways, layering the character with levels of pain, 
desire and resilience.'

Actor Jeff Still wrote a touching tribute to her on Facebook.

'Chicago, and the world, has lost one sassy, lovely, talented redhead. I
 can't pretend I knew her better than I did, but anyone who is or has 
been a part of the great theater community of Chicago knows it's a very 
tight-knit group, and we all swim in the same pool,' he wrote.

'My heart goes out to Joe, and all of their family, and all of my 
brothers and sisters in the Chicago theater community, especially those 
who knew Molly well. And my heart goes out to all of us, as this kind of
 death is always a sobering, shattering reminder of how fragile all our 
lives are.'
