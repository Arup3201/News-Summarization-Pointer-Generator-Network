Wine and dine: Sweets such as wine gums are good for a quick energy boost

I am 73 and running in my first half marathon. Can you advise me on diet, both before the event and on the day?

Firstly, congratulations on stepping up to the challenge! 

In the US last year, only four per cent of marathon-runners were  over the age of 65, so you’re part of a fitness elite.

Your nutritional needs before and during the event won’t differ significantly from your fellow runners, but your age does mean there are a few things to consider when it comes to your recovery.

During training, it’s common wisdom that you should significantly increase your carb intake because the body’s preferred fuel for running (or any endurance sport) is glycogen, which is how the body stores carbohydrate.

Aim for 60 to 70 per cent of your daily calories to come from carbs, which can be in the form of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products.

Endurance runners also need  50 per cent more protein than sedentary adults (about 12 to 15 per cent of your daily calories), as it’s essential for muscle growth and repair.

To figure out the right amount, multiply your weight in kilograms by 1.3, or your weight in pounds by 0.6, to calculate the number of grams of protein you should consume per day.

On race day, seasoned marathon-runners refuel regularly – before the tank runs out – with concentrated energy sources. There are specific products for this, like sports drinks, chews and gels, but wine gums and other sweets are popular.

Another trick is to drink beetroot juice before the race, as it helps blood vessels dilate and increases blood flow to muscles during exercise. Which brings us to recovery nutrition.

Older runners are more susceptible to muscle damage – upping your intake of Vitamin C, omega-3, sulphur-containing amino acids, bioflavonoids and antioxidants in the weeks after your race will help rebuild and maintain muscle tone and strength. Good luck!

My husband and I really need to slim down, but it’s hard to know where to start. When our daughters were younger, we got lots of exercise running around after them or going on healthy walks, but they’ve long since left home.

I don’t think we eat badly, we don’t eat ready meals or junk food and I don’t have a sweet tooth, except for a few sugars in my tea.

But clearing out a cupboard recently, I found a favourite old dress – size 10, and I’m now squeezing into a 16. I’m worried for my husband’s health as he’s bigger than his father was when he died of a heart attack. There’s a trendy local gym but it’s not for us – we’re both mid-50s. My daughter got me down to a Zumba class but I hated it. What else can we do to lose weight?

Self control: Ruby advices a woman to start eating smaller portions and cut out the daily sugar in her tea

You’re right to address this issue now. The earlier you can get down to a healthy weight, the better – especially with your husband’s family history of heart disease. About 75 per cent of weight loss is down to what you eat and it’s great that you cook your own meals, because it should be easy for you to start planning lighter options.

Simply eating less – aka portion control– is the first place to start! My friend Robyn bought smaller plates to stop her overeating. As a visual guide, each meal should be able to fit comfortably into your two cupped hands.

Be really honest with yourselves about how much you snack between meals; try sticking to a solid three meals a day.

Keeping a food diary will help you keep track. Those sugars in your tea all add up, too. There are roughly 30 calories in two teaspoons of sugar, so at four cups a day that’s 120 calories – the equivalent of a small packet of crisps. Time to cut it out.

Have you ever thought about trying a vegan diet? Following the guidelines in the hit book Forks Over Knives, which recommends a plant-based, wholefood diet as a way to combat all kinds of health issues, helped Bill Clinton, also a high-risk candidate for heart disease, drop more than two stone.

And who says your healthy walks have to stop just because your daughters have left home?

If you’re lucky enough to live somewhere you can get out and go rambling, make the most of it. It sounds as if long walks with your husband are something you’ll  both enjoy.

Gwyn way or the highway: Gwyneth Paltrow likes to keep herself - and her men - in shape

On the subject of exercise  for couples, I love the story about Gwyneth Paltrow sending her new squeeze  Brad Falchuk (the co-creator of Glee) off to train with scary Tracey Anderson.

Fitness fanatic Gwyneth is rumoured to work out two hours a day, six days a week to maintain her trim physique, and obviously wants her man showing the same commitment.

While we can’t  all be expected to maintain an A-list exercise regime like theirs, working out with your other half can be a great motivator in achieving your fitness goals.

A word of caution though, Gwynnie – Tracy Anderson’s method involves eating a lot of puree, and I’m pretty sure the way to a man’s heart isn’t through feeding him baby food...

Festival season is a distant memory – but one ‘did I dream that’ moment that keeps coming back to me was Conservative MP David Tredinnick’s talk on astrology for health with Daily Mail star-gazer Jonathan Cainer.

As vice-chairman of the Government’s herbals working group, to say Mr Tredinnick – who openly champions complimentary medicine – is outspoken would be an understatement. He now seems to be giving David Icke a run for his money by admitting he believes studying your astrological chart can give vital clues into an individual’s health and wellbeing. Well, David, I salute you!

I find astrology fascinating, and  in the Indian Ayurvedic medical system, used by millions of people, working with the planets is often  key to diagnosing the right course of treatment. The idea is that the horoscope is a blueprint of the whole being, reflecting the complex interaction of body, mind and spirit.

I take the odd painkiller, rarely,  and am lucky never to get ill. I was raised with homeopathy as the family go-to for many everyday ailments. I know a lot of people out there think its all crackpot stuff, but tell me this: is exploring alternatives more or less foolish than the constant antibiotic overuse that has left us on the brink of these life-saving drugs becoming useless?

Leaky Gut Syndrome  is the latest digestive ailment for neurotic New Yorkers. The unappetising ‘condition’ is blamed for everything from food allergies, low energy levels and joint pain to thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions and  a slow metabolism.

It refers  to a weakened gut wall developing holes that allow undigested food particles, bacteria and toxins to pass into the blood stream. IBS  and bloating can be early symptoms, while multiple  food sensitivities are another giveaway.

Common causes are said to be stress, poor diet and eating unsprouted grains, sugar, genetically modified crops and dairy products.
