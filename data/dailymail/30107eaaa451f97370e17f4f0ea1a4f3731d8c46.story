Darren Cave has admitted it is time to ‘stop complaining and start playing well’ after being parachuted into the Ireland side to face Georgia on Saturday.

The Ulster centre spent last week holidaying in New York while Ireland saw off South Africa 29-15 in Dublin, only to be called into the squad on Sunday night.

Two weeks ago boss Joe Schmidt told Cave he was omitted from Ireland’s 37-man autumn squad, but has brought the 27-year-old quickly back in from the cold.

Cave spoke out over his limited Test chances last year, claiming his ‘face doesn’t fit’ in the Ireland set-up, but is now keen to put his controversial past to bed. ‘It’s important not to feel sorry for yourself, just keep improving, improving and improving,’ said Cave.

‘It was only two or three weeks ago I was on the phone to Joe, talking about how I wasn’t going to be involved in the camp week.

‘Then I got a phone call from him on Sunday saying come on in to camp and I’m thrown in to play there. I’m delighted.

‘I’ve never been capped in Ireland before, and growing up since I was knee-high watching games at Lansdowne Road, this is a big day for me and my family.’
