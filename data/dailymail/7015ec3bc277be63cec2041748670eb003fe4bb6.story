A state trooper in Des Moines, Iowa, had a lucky escape on Friday morning after an out of control truck became airborne, leaving Interstate 80 and narrowly avoided crushing him.

Trooper Jesse Hernandez was sitting in his unmarked patrol car speaking with two Johnson County Sheriff’s Department deputies near a crash site on I-80.

The dramatic footage – captured on the 
dashboard camera of one of the vehicles - looks more like the chase 
sequence of an action movie rather than routine police work.

Lucky escape: Trooper Jesse Hernandez was sitting in his unmarked patrol car speaking with two Johnson County Sheriff¿s Department deputies when the crash occurred

Out of nowhere, a vehicle careers into view, clipping the back of Hernandez's vehicle and narrowly missing
 Johnson County Sheriff's Deputy Hammes and Reserve Deputy Pearson, who 
were standing by Hernandez's passenger door.

According to the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office, a truck driver got distracted by the flashing lights at the crash scene and drove his rig into the back of a pickup truck driven by Dana Miller of Eldridge, Iowa.

The impact sent the pickup across the westbound lanes and flying into the shoulder, where it clipped the unmarked patrol car and narrowly avoided seriously injuring Hernandez or the other officers.

The pickup then hit the ditch and a mile-marker sign post before it stopped, reports WQAD.

‘This is just a glaring example of how 
close we came to losing Trooper Hernandez, Deputy Hammes, along with 
Reserve Deputy Pearson,’ Sheriff Lonny Pulkrabek told KGAN News in Cedar
 Rapids, Iowa.

‘All because a driver of a semi chose not to slow down when approaching a crash scene full of vehicles and emergency lights.’

Miller was wearing a seat belt and he was not hurt.

Trooper Hernandez was taken by another state police vehicle to an area hospital where he was treated and released. Neither of the deputies were hurt.

Police said the semi driver, 49-year-old Michael Smith of Arlington, Iowa, was also not hurt. 

Smith was cited for failure to maintain control of his vehicle.
