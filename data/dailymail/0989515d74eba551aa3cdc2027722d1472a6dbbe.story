No one forgets their first job, and for one woman that will always be especially true.

Cathy Calhoun's first job was as a bank teller at The National Bank of Spring City in Spring City, Pennsylvania, and when she learned in 1989 that the bank was closing and up for sale, she decided she would purchase the property.

What's more, she decided to turn the bank into her new home.

Calhoun paid $52,000 for about 5,200 square-feet of living space when she bought the bank, which was built in 1872, and soon after went about deciding how to make the interior like a home.

According to CNN Money, the clipping room of the bank, where individuals would clip coupons from their bonds, became a powder room, the upstairs vault became a bar, and the downstairs vault, which had no ventilation, became a steam room.

Calhoun also restored the clock that used to be in front of the bank, and emptied many of the safety deposit boxes, finding money that had been printed at the bank, old ledgers and books, and even spectacles.

Calhoun had the ceilings painted with pink and blue clouds

The bank is on the National Register of Historic Places

She also put new lettering outside, labeling the building Calhoun Federal.

The boardroom meanwhile became her master bedroom, one of three bedrooms in the building, and there is still one area left to explore in the basement.

It seems that when the bank stopped printing money, the machine was concreted in rather than being carried out, and for her next project, Calhoun just might see what's back there in that basement.

And it seems she may not be alone in the home either, and after a 1921 robbery left one man dead after he suffocated in the vault, some have claimed to see his ghost wandering the stairs.

Not to worry though, Calhoun says if he is there, he is very friendly.
