Manchester City continued their 100 per cent record in the UEFA Youth League as second-half strikes from Olivier Ntcham and Thierry Ambrose saw them come from behind to beat Roma.

Francesco Di Mariano had fired the visitors into a 54th-minute lead at Ewen Fields in Hyde but City soon turned the game on its head to follow up their 4-1 win over Bayern Munich a fortnight ago.

French midfielder Ntcham equalised with a long-range effort just nine minutes later before setting up his compatriot Ambrose to complete the turnaround on 72 minutes.

Roma searched desperately for an equaliser but City goalkeeper Angus Gunn kept them at bay with a fantastic series of saves at close quarters.

Patrick Vieira's City side then had to endure a nervy six minutes of stoppage time before victory was confirmed.

With back-to-back matches against CSKA Moscow to come, City are now strong favourites to advance from the group.
