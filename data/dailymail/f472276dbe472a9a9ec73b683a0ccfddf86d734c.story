A newlywed from Maryland has revealed how watching her boyfriend momentarily die in her arms confirmed how much she loved him, and inspired her to change career.

Erica Koogle had been studying English at university when an undiagnosed heart defect nearly took the life of her then-boyfriend Cody in January last year.

The shock of nearly losing the man she loved spurred Erica on to not only get married, but also to change her career plans and become a nurse.

Devoted: Erica and Cody have their first dance a year after a heart defect nearly killed Cody

On the day of the heart attack Erica, then 19, had been getting up early to work on a paper for university.

'Normally when I get up early Cody
tries to keep me in bed, and would wrap his arms around me as I tried to get up. But his arms were stiff and 
then he started flailing them,' she told Mail Online.

'I thought it was a joke at first. It was very unexpected. It took me about 10 seconds to realize what was happening and to dial 911.'

Unbeknown to the couple, who had been dating for a couple of years, Cody had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome which means that an extra electrical current runs through his heart.

Before the heart attack Cody had been a program director at a martial arts studio, and the couple were both fit and healthy.

'We just woke up and he was dying,' Erica said. 'We both do martial arts, and were in good health so it really came out of the blue.'

Worrying times: Cody, pictured as he recovers from having a defibrillator fitted. He was unconscious for a couple of days after the heart attack

After calling 911, Erica pulled Cody to the floor and started to perform CPR until paramedics arrived and shocked his heart back to life. 

'He was very 
heavy. I don't know how I managed to get him off the bed without 
whacking his head,' she said.

'When I got home from the hospital later that day I 
was so sore and didn't know why. Then I remembered, I'd lifted a 200lb man.'

After being unconscious for three days, and undergoing several procedures including having a defibrillator fitted, Cody is slowly getting back to his former self.

The heart attack was a life-changing 
moment for the couple, who decided to get engaged about eight months 
later. They celebrated their wedding earlier this year.

On Friday, Erica posted a picture of the couple having their first dance at their wedding on the Blaze Best Moments Facebook page.

'In January 2013, my boyfriend died in my arms,' she wrote under the picture. The picture is of our first dance at our wedding just over a year later.

Commitment: Cody and Erica had been dating for about two years when he had a heart attack. The experience made their relationship stronger

Life changing: After nearly losing Cody, Erica decided to retrain to become a nurse

'That day was the best day I could ever hope to imagine. He is mine, he is healthy and he is not stuck in a bed anymore!'

The experience changed Erica's life professionally as well as personally. Before Cody's heart attack, she had been studying English and sociology, but the medical emergency made her rethink her career plans. 

'We'd been
 dating about two years. I already knew I wanted to marry 
him but seeing him like that and realizing he may not be there any more 
made me realize I couldn't be without him,' she said.

After suffering panic attacks, Erica decided to take a semester off to help her come to terms with what had happened.

During this time she decided to retrain as a nurse, and is due to start her training in Towson University this August. 

For Cody, who had been working as a project director for a martial arts studio, he remembers very little about the heart attack or the days that 
followed.

Remarkably, he returned to sports 
training just two weeks after leaving hospital. Although martial art 
remains his passion, he changed career, and gone into the restaurant 
business.

Unexpected: The heart attack came as a shock to the couple, who both do martial arts and thought they were fit and healthy

Erica
 said that on the day he regained consciousness she was at home and had 
missed a call at 5.30am from the hospital, which had panicked her.

'I
 was really stressed, thinking "Did he die again?". Then his mother came 
to the top of the stairs and called out, "Cody's on the phone, he's 
bored".

'He wanted to know what's going on and when I was going to visit,' Erica laughed.

The couple, now aged 21 and 23, said they still talk about the shocking experience, saying it has become part of their lives. Erica even mentioned it in their vows.

Fortunately, since his diagnosis, Cody has suffered no further problems.
