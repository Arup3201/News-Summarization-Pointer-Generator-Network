Everyone loves a relaxing trip to the hair salon, and two-year-old Miles is clearly no exception.

His appointment must have been booked in close to nap time, as the tired toddler took chilling out to the next level, nodding off while the stylist trimmed his hair.

Despite her trying to distract him when his eyes become heavy, Miles is intent on getting forty winks while he gets the chop and continues to drift off.

Even the whirring noise of hairdryers is no match for Miles' keenness for a kip and he keeps on snoozing as they blow at full volume. 

The boy's mother, who holds his chin up as he drops off, to prevent a wonky haircut, says he's never fallen asleep at the hairdressers like this before.

It seems like this was more of a power nap than a lengthy sleep for young Miles though.

'As soon as the stylist was finished, he woke up', his mother said. 

'He smiled his shy smile and off we went'.

Catching Zs: even the noisy hairdryers don't ruin Miles' mid-salon snooze
