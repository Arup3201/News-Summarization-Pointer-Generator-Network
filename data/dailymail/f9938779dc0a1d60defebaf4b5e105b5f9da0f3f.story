A symbol of the Australian outback and a traditional shield against the harsh beating sun, the Akubra hat has been Australian made and owned for more than 130 years.

But as Australia’s rabbit numbers continue to shrink and domestic suppliers dwindle, the brand has been forced to import 65-70 per cent of its materials from sources overseas - predominately Ukraine.

Each hat is made from about 12 rabbit skins, an easy feat back in the early 20th century for the factory based in Kempsey, NSW, when rabbits plagued the countryside.

Iconic: The Akubra hat is a symbol of the Australian outback and has recently seen huge demand from China and also Tibet

With rabbit skins used to make the hats, as the animals' numbers have steadily decline in Australia, Akubra has had to find overseas suppliers, including Ukraine

Akubra's Managing director Stephen Keir, told the ABC that the iconic brand had a long and proud history.

'Rabbit fur is the best fur to make our hats out of, and the rabbit industry in the '40s and '50s was absolutely enormous, wild rabbits that is, there was no farmed rabbits in those days,' Mr Keir said.

'It started off in Tasmania as a fur-cutting business and we moved up to Sydney and started making hats. My great-grandfather married the boss's daughter and generations later I'm here now.'

Still vastly popular from its onset, Akubra hats still sell like wild fire with the biggest buyers outside of the consistent rural community including the Australian Defence Force with which the company holds a five-year contract.

But the biggest and most recent fan of the Australian hats is China, which Mr Keir described as 'going gangbusters' with the product.

Akubra started in Tasmania and eventually moved to Sydney. Today, its factory is located in Kempsey, on NSW north coast

He said Tibet was expected to buy about 12,000 hats from the little company this year alone, easily becoming Akubra's biggest importer.

But producing the hats has become more and more problematic over the last decade due to the great success of the Calicivirus.

Introduced to rabbits in the 1990s to control the pest's numbers and protect native wildlife, the solution has reduced rabbit numbers by about 90 per cent.

Consequently, rabbit farms have dwindled as vaccines for farmers prove expensive, with three large companies closing in the last year or so.

Mr Keir is left with no choice but to look towards overseas suppliers for his company, with his biggest source coming from Ukraine.

'We just can't get it here. And what we can get is expensive and not of very good quality so we have to supplement that with stuff from overseas. Basically I can import fur from France and put it on a plane and have it here within a week.'

Despite the challenges, Mr Keir confirmed the production process will remain in Australia.
