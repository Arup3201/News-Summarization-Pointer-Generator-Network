Rizwan Arshad, who has been jailed for 21 years

A blind man has been jailed for 21 years after he was described as the 'mastermind' of two plots to flood the streets with more than £300,000-worth of Class A drugs.

Despite his disability, Rizwan Arshad was the ringleader of an operation involving the distribution of heroin and cocaine and massive amounts of cutting agents in the Bradford and Huddersfield areas - the first in 2012 and the second while on bail last year.

Arshad, 33, from Bradford, was one of six people jailed by Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC for their parts in the 'sophisticated and planned enterprise'.

The judge told Arshad that his barrister had asked for a discount because of the difficulties he will face in prison through his blindness, but said: 'That has not prevented you in the past committing offences of deception, it has not prevented you achieving degree status at university and it did not prevent your role in these conspiracies.

'It is an indication of your sheer intelligence being at the heart of the essence of these matters.

'It may be incredible to the observer that someone of your undoubted disability was managing to run and managing to co-ordinate and fulfil the needs of such a conspiracy.'

Police observations showed Arshad, of Lower Rushton Road, Thornbury, had a BMW which he had gained through the Motability scheme and would rely on other drivers 'and lieutenants' to help him with his activities. 

Huge amounts of drugs and cash were seized from the group by police, including £264,000-worth of cocaine, £50,000-worth of heroin and 33 kilograms of bulking agents. 

Police surveillance also revealed regular meetings in Bradford, Huddersfield and South Yorkshire.

'The object was to supply in the streets of this area a mass of cocaine or heroin with the aim of enriching you, Arshad, and those around you,' said Judge Durham Hall

Detective Insp Philip Little added: 'The investigations of Arshad and his associates showed him to be the head of an established organised crime group whose criminal activities in trafficking controlled drugs and cutting agents stretched across West Yorkshire and beyond. He will now spend a lengthy period in prison.'

Andrew Kershaw, prosecuting, suggested Arshad had a second home in Salford Quays.

He made at least one trip to Dubai and another to Amsterdam that year while also enjoying a holiday with his wife in Mauritius.

Ramunas Venckus, who has been jailed for five years

The first case occurred between January and October 2012, and culminated in caffeine, Paracetamol and benzocaine - all of which were being used as cutting agents - being seized.

In July that year he was found in a taxi with £108,000 of drug contaminated notes in bundles.

He was arrested and granted bail, but continued to operate while being covertly watched by police.

He was seen meeting with his 'lieutenant' Aftab Basharat, 25, and 36-year-old Matthew Francois - who headed up the Huddersfield side of the operation.

Arshad also played a part in a third conspiracy in Burnley. 

He was found guilty by a jury at Bradford Crown Court of one conspiracy to supply class A drugs and pleaded guilty to two others.

Francois, from Benny Park Close, Batley, was jailed for 10 years after admitting one charge of conspiracy.

Basharat, of Derby Road, Thornbury, admitted two charges of conspiracy and was jailed for eight years.

Lithuanian Ramunas Venckus, 43, of Watling Street, Dartford, Kent was jailed for five years after the judge linked him to the incoming drug supply.

Samantha Colquhoun, 28, of Horse Bank Drive, Lockwood, who admitted permitting the use of premises for supplying Class A drugs, was given 18 months in prison suspended for two years with a 30 day activity requirement.
