A mentally-ill woman in a coma is allegedly being pursued by government workers to assess her fitness to work.

Sheila Holt, who is bipolar, had been receiving income support - but was sectioned under the Mental Health Act last month after becoming terrified when the payments were removed, her family claim.

Now, the 47-year-old woman from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has been sent a letter by government-contracted healthcare company ATOS to find out whether she can gain employment.

Her family claim Ms Holt became terrified and suffered a breakdown when her benefits were withdrawn, before having a heart attack. They say she has been in a coma for more than a month.

But ATOS - which is used by the Department for Work and Pensions to assess those suitable for work under a benefits provision shake-up - now wants to assess her fitness to work.

Her family said a long-standing mental health disorder has meant she has never worked. Her case has now been taken up by Labour’s Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who has visited her in hospital.

He said the Government’s welfare reforms and the controversial Work Capability Assessment handled by ATOS were being ‘bulldozed through in an incompetent and insensitive way’.

Mr Danczuk added that Ms Holt had recently come off psychiatric treatment and been pushed onto the work programme, despite her family arguing that she could not work because of her mental illness.

He said: ‘From day one the approach by the Department of Work and Pensions has been clumsy and horribly misguided.

'I accept reform is not easy. But there has to be a smarter and more compassionate way of differentiating between those that cannot work and those that do not want to work.

'I am in favour of welfare reform but trying to bulldoze through changes in a reckless and insensitive way is not the right way to go about it.’

The MP said he feared Ms Holt’s experience was being repeated elsewhere in the country.

Ms Holt’s father Kenneth, who released the photograph published by MailOnline of his daughter in a coma, said her prognosis ‘was not good’ - but vowed that he would not give up hope of her regaining consciousness.

He said: ‘We feel the coalition’s changes to the welfare system are grossly unfair to a section of the community with mental health issues.’

Atos Healthcare spokesperson said: 'Our thoughts are with the family of Ms Holt at this difficult time and we are sorry for any further distress caused.

'When an application for benefit is made we receive a referral from the Department for Work and Pensions will automatically issue the standardised ESA50 claim form so that a claim for benefit can be made.

'Where we know of a change in circumstances either through the DWP or the family we will return the referral to the Department and not send any correspondence.'

Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants are expected to actively look for employment and attend an assessment after 13 weeks out of work.

If the claimants are struggling with their search, they should  develop skills and experience to help them find work, and are expected to 'work for their benefits', even if it means working for free. Otherwise, their benefits might stop.

However, it may be possible to get hardship payments whilst their Jobseeker’s Allowance is stopped. Claimants should ask their Jobcentre to find out.
