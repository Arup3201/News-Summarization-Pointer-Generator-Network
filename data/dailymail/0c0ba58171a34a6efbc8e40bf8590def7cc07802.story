Bigfoot is the real deal and he's developed a taste for takeaway pizza, a Michigan man has claimed.

Anthony Padilla, from Midland County, says he's been leaving boxes of pepperoni-topped pizza pies out for the mythical beast who's been gobbling them up near his home.

Mr Padilla, who insists he's not crazy, claims he's seen the Sasquatch several times roaming the woods in central Michigan looking for food.

'Not mad': Anthony Padilla, from Midland County, Michigan, says he's been leaving boxes of pepperoni-topped pizza pies out for a Bigfoot

The Michigan State Police are refusing to investigate the sightings, but his local TV network TV5 decided to take a look.

Mr Padilla told the station: 'At first, I just thought it was a huge man in a Ghillie suit [camouflage clothing]. So then, I look into his face, right dead in his eyes, and they were so red they looked like they were full of blood, like a man on his deathbed.'

Mr Padillo says he's been trying to prove that Bigfoot exists for years. He cities his collection of evidence; items like footprints, broken branches, and even droppings.

Mr Padilla said he's trying to catch the Sasquatch by putting food into pizza boxes.

He says in the morning he finds the boxes folded or rolled. He added Bigfoot likes also to eat Mexican or Chinese. Â 

Bigfoot researcher Matthew Smith Jr said: 'We look into investigations very carefully because sometimes people could be trying to pull a prank.

'Many people have claimed [that] a big hairy creature [ran] across the road, so there's [something] going on up there. Whether it's Bigfoot, I can't say.'

'I believe I can "out-Bigfoot" anyone on this Earth! It's like, I don't even have to try, he just gives it to me.'
