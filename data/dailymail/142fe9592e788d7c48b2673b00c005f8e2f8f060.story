Long illness: Peter Gilmore as James Onedin in the BBC drama The Onedin Line

But he will be best remembered for his portrayal of the mutton-chopped James Onedin in 91 episodes of the BBC1 series The Onedin Line.

The saga - with its theme tune familiar to a generation - followed the fortunes of a family shipping line in the second half of the 19th century.

His co-star Jessica Benton, who also appeared in other BBC period dramas The Duchess Of Duke Street and Upstairs, Downstairs, said: 'The Onedin Line was a very happy, long-running series to be involved in and that was all credit to Peter because he made it so.

'We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun.

'Peter was a gentle man and a gentleman and we sorely miss him.'

Born in Leipzig, he came to the UK at six and was raised in Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire, leaving school at 14 to pursue an acting career.

His big break was in the TV series Ivanhoe in 1958 and he went on to appear in West End musical stage successes such as Lock Up Your Daughters and The Beggar's Opera.

Gilmore's penultimate appearance was as the flirtatious but dangerous King Francis in Carry On Henry which was his biggest and best role in a Carry On

Among his many films, he appeared in popular comedies such as Carry On Up The Khyber and Carry On Henry as well as the ghoulish British horror film The Abominable Doctor Phibes.

Gilmore, who died on Sunday, was married to actress Una Stubbs for more than a decade and went on to marry Anne Stallybrass, who also played his wife in the first two series of The Onedin Line.

His agent Primie Carey said: 'On behalf of his wife Anne and Peter's family I would like to thank those who have sent their kind thoughts and condolences and would request their privacy is respected at this sad time.'

James Onedin's name derived from a sea nymph after the programme's creator, Cyril Abraham, read about the mythological figure Ondine. 

In 1978 he starred opposite Doug McLure in the film Warlords Of Atlantis and regretted becoming too typecast as Onedin in his pursuit for other lead roles. 

During the 1950s and 60s he became known for his performances in British stage musicals, appearing in Hooray For Daisy, and met actress Una Stubbs while working on the programme Cool For Cats.

The couple married in 1958 but separated after 11 years.

Gilmore would also become a familiar face in the Carry On films and appeared in 11 of the well-loved British movies. 

In 1970 he married stage actress Jan Waters but the couple divorced six years later and Gilmore began living with Anne Stallybrass who played his wife in The Onedin Line.

The pair went on to marry in 1987. 

In his later years he played a security chief called Brazen in the Doctor Who series, who died while trying to help the doctor escape.

He is survived by his wife Anne and a son, Jason, from his first marriage.
