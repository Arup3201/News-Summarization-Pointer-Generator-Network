A Christian pastor has pledged to love his children regardless of their sexuality.

Father-of-two John Pavlovitz had led his congregation at North Wake House Church, North Carolina, for 18 years.

Now, in a controversial move that has shocked many Christians, he has outlined a four-part promise to embrace his children - Noah and Selah - if they come out.

Pledge: John Pavlovitz, pictured with his wife Jennifer, daughter Selah and son Noah, is a pastor of 18 years from North Carolina and vows to love both his children whether they are gay or straight 

In the blog post that has gone viral, he stipulates four promises: to be open about it, to pray for them, to love them, and to accept them as they are.

He writes: 'If I have gay children, you'll all know it', adding that they won't be 'the best kept secret' in his family.

In the second promise, to 'pray for them', he explains: 'I won't pray that God will heal or change or fix them. 

'I will pray for God to protect them; from the ignorance and hatred and violence that the world will throw at them, simply because of who they are.'

'Above all,' he adds, 'I'll pray to God that my children won't allow the unGodly treatment they might receive from some of His misguided children, to keep them from pursuing Him.'

Thirdly, he will love them - clarifying that he will not love them despite their sexuality or because of it.

'I don't mean some token, distant, tolerant love that stays at a safe arm's length. It will be an extravagant, open-hearted, unapologetic, lavish, embarrassing-them-in-the-school cafeteria, kind of love.

Acceptance: He says if one or both children come out to him, he won't pray that God will 'fix' them

Love: Pavlovitz, pictured with his son Noah, says he will not love them because of or despite their sexuality

'If they're gay, they are already': Pavlovitz, pictured with his daughter Selah, has divided opinion among his readers with his analysis of Psalm 139 which says God 'stitched them together in their mother's womb'

'They'll never doubt for a second whether or not their Daddy is over-the-moon crazy about them.'

He ends by explaining that he will accept them as they are because 'if my kids are going to be gay, well they pretty much already are.'

He quotes Psalm 139, which says that God 'stitched them together in their mother's womb', by way of explaining: 'I don't believe there's some magical expiration date approaching, by which time she and I need to somehow do, or say, or pray just the right things to get them to "turn straight", or forever lose them to the other side.

'They are today, simply a younger version of who they will be -- and today they're pretty darn great.'

Pre-empting backlash, Pavlovitz, who is pictured with his wife Jennifer and two children, concludes his blog with a message to his religious readers.

Protective: He said Noah and Selah may doubt many things but they will never doubt his love for them

He writes: 'Many of you may be offended by all of this, I fully realize. I know this may be especially true if you are a religious person -- one who finds the whole topic disgusting or unpleasant.

'If you're a parent, I don't know how you'll respond if you find out your children are gay, but I pray you consider it. 

'If that day should ever come for me -- if my children should ever come out to me -- this is the Dad I hope I'll be to them.' 

The post amassed more than 2,000 comments in just a few days, with both gushing praise and damning abuse.

One reader wrote: 'This is beautiful! I was smiling as I read the entire post.'

However, another said: 'I find this extremely sad. How can a supposed pastor glorify sinful behavior?'
