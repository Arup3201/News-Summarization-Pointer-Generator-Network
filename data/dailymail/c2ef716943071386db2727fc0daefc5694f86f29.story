Actor Vince Vaughn and pop star Lady Gaga mustered up the courage to dive into freezing cold water for the Special Olympics charity the day after cities across the country broke cold records for last month.

The Chicago-native Wedding Crashers star was the celebrity guest of honor at his hometown's annual Polar Plunge, in which brave swimmers raise money for athletes with special needs by plunging into Lake Michigan.

Vaughn, wearing a Blackhawks hockey jersey and jeans, led the way into a patch of frigid, slushy 33 degree water near Lincoln Park that had been cleared of snow, which has accumulated in the city and much of the US.

The star of upcoming movie Unfinished Business  first went in up to his knees before lowering himself into the water backwards.

Gaga attended the event with shirtless fiance Taylor Kinney, who was wearing a baseball cap and shorts, and his costars from the show Chicago Fire.

The singer rode piggyback-style with Kinney into the water before they fully immersed themselves into the lake.

The couple then played with each other in the frozen surf and retreated to the warmth of the shore.

'Taylor gave me his hat I thought my wig was gonna freeze into and become one with the lake,' said the songstress, who will take different sort of plunge with her beau after becoming engaged last month..

Lake Michigan was estimated to be right at freezing when the event began at 10.30am Central Time.

Organizers say that 5,000 people were expected to attend the plunge, and that they had already made more than $1million during the morning, according to ABC7.

The plunge came at the end of a February that had seen cold records shattered across much of the US, which has seen snow in almost every state this winter. 

Chicago, which has seen weeks of freezing temperatures in the past month, tied a 140-year-old record for its coldest February with an average temperature of 14.6.

Temperatures at O'Hare Airport hit minus 10 degrees Saturday morning, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The Windy City also received a combined 27 inches of snow in February, the city's third highest level ever for the month. 

New York City had its coldest February in 81 years with an average of 19.9.

The last time February was this cold in the metropolis was 1934, according to The New York Times.

That month it averaged 19.9 and saw a reading of 15 degrees below zero on February 9, the coldest day ever seen in the city.

The only other February on record that was cold than this past month was in 1885 - when the average daily temperature was 22.7 degrees  

Coast Guard icebreakers are being used to break up East Coast rivers such as the Hudson and Delaware. 

Cities in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Maine also broke records for their coldest Februaries. 

And meteorologists say that the winter weather isn't quite over yet. 

Many already knew in their bones it was true - but official figures have now confirmed that for some parts of the country, February was the coldest month in history.

In New York, the cities of Buffalo, Syracuse, Binghamton and Ithaca all scored their lowest ever averages in more than a lifetime.

In Buffalo the February average was 10.9°F, beating the 1934 record of 11.4°F. Syracuse was colder still, with an average of just 9°F.

Hartford, Connecitcut, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Portland, Maine also set records. Caribou in Maine had an average of just 2.5°F.

While Boston has been colder in February before, it has never been snowier. Its 64.8 inches in February smashed the old record of 41.6. If it managers just another 5.6 inches, the winter will officially be the snowiest ever.

Total snowfall for the season is way above normal across the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. As of Febreuary 26, Worcester, Massachusetts had 108.6 inches, compared to a normal snowfall of 49.9 inches.

However, meteorologists at the Northeast Regional Climate Center said the record winter is just down to luck. One said: 'We can't point to anything specific... It's just the way the jet stream bulged and set up. It's random, like a deal of cards. Sometimes you're dealt a royal flush, sometimes you get nothing.' 

Duties continue: The tug Arabian Sea pushes a barge through the ice on the Hudson River on Friday. The Coast Guard has been busy clearing shipping lanes during the long stretch of winter weather

Record-breaking: Ice chunks form underneath the snow-covered Brooklyn Bridge in New York City at the end of the coldest February in more than 80 years - and two more snow storms are expected to hit the region over the next few days

Texas has already seen six inches of snow as a result of the most recent storm, with Oklahoma - seven inches - and New Mexico - one foot - also receiving additional portions of the fluffy white stuff.

Weather forecasters in Colorado issued blizzard and avalanche warnings as Pacific moisture continued to bring snow and strong winds to the Continental Divide on Sunday. 

The storm was expected to last through Monday, with another storm expected Tuesday. 

Snow, sleet and ice from Winter Storm Sparta spread  eastward across the Plains, Midwest and Northeast, and Illinois and Indiana each got 8 inches or more of snow Sunday.

Heartland states have already seen tragic weather-related deaths and hospitalizations as cold continues to blow across the middle of the country.

Two people were killed when a driver lost control on a snow-covered highway in Lebanon, Missouri, on Saturday when the car skidded into a tractor-trailer stopped because of an earlier crash on Interstate 44.

In Nevada, Missouri, a boy died after falling through an ice-covered farm pond. Two other boys who fell in were able to be rescued.

A 3-year-old Lansing, Michigan, girl was hospitalized in critical condition after getting stuck overnight outside her family's apartment during frigid weather that marked the end of one of the coldest Februaries on record in Michigan.

The storm reached the East Coast on Sunday, with up to three inches of snow possible in New York.

Winter storm warnings have been issued for Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia through Monday morning, with up to quarter-inch ice accumulations from northern Virginia through central New Jersey.

After cold and snow that set February records, southern New England is entering March with another round that could push Boston over its 20-year-old snowfall record.

With 102 inches, Boston needs 5.7 more to break the 1995-1996 record of 107.6.

Snowfall of 4 to 6 inches was expected by early Monday across the area, with up to 8 inches in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

'We have come this far, we might as well break the record,' said William Babcock, National Weather Service meteorologist in the Taunton, Massachusetts office. 

'We have a couple of storms to push us over the record. Once that is done we won't complain if we don't get any more snow.' 

Less snow is expected in northern Massachusetts and New York state, and on Cape Cod.

Winter Storm Thor, which began forming in California on Saturday, is expected to follow Sparta across the continent, according to the Weather Channel.
