Her books are stuffed full of delicious recipes for meat, game and fish dishes.

But Mary Berry has revealed there is one animal – horse – she will absolutely not cook or eat because it reminds her of a treasured childhood friend.

When she was a girl, the Great British Bake Off judge had a pony called Kerry Lass. The pair were so close that when Mary was struck down by polio at the age of 13, her father walked Kerry Lass four miles to see her at the hospital.

When Mary was better, she went on to win rosettes with Kerry Lass at pony shows.

So when Mary was first served horsemeat, it reduced her to tears.

She explained: ‘At 17 I went away to Pau in the South of France for a few months to study domestic science, including cleaning windows with newspaper and water, while living with a Catholic family with ten children.

‘I’d left my pony at home and on the journey I kept seeing horses’ heads in villages, then the first night the family served me horsemeat and I cried and I cried. Tears poured down throughout the meal but they took little notice. I just hated it.

‘I wasn’t allowed in their kitchen during the day and didn’t go in there at night because there were rats.’

The TV chef had only been introduced to domestic science the year before. In an interview with the Observer Food Monthly magazine, she recalled: ‘My parents went to the head teacher at Bath Grammar when I was 16 and said, “What could Mary do?” and she replied, “I don’t know, very little. Perhaps she could be a child’s nurse.”

In an interview the 79-year-old said she first took up baking at school when domestic science was offered as a subject

‘And my father said, “I’d pity the child.” But I was in the first bunch of pupils who could choose between Latin and maths and domestic science... and there was a brand new domestic science department.

‘I’d never baked with Mother but when I brought home a treacle pudding, Father said it was as good as Mother made.’

Miss Berry, 79, also said that she struggled with her weight in her younger years. ‘I got chubby as a teen, and then, when my children were young, I was half at home and half at work and there were all their crusts available at home and all my cooking and testing at work, and it all went on my bottom, as it may.

‘But I’ve had my bottom under control for the last few years!’

And the wine-loving presenter revealed that she hasn’t touched a drop of alcohol following her knee-replacement surgery in January.

‘Each night since, my husband has said, “A glass of wine, Mary?” and I’ve said no. But... I think I’d better get back to normal!’
