A petition calling on a company to reinstate a sacked disabled groundsman - who hasn’t missed a day’s work in 27 years - has attracted support from around the world.

Daniel White, 44, who has learning difficulties, has spruced up Collett Park in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, since being hired by the council at the age of 17.

He has worked full time for the minimum wage, cutting the grass in the huge municipal park and clearing the paths - and has never had a day off or arrived late.

But a new company took over the council’s contract and made Daniel redundant - despite keeping all his workmates in their jobs.

Landscape Group said staff would now have to work across different sites including roadside and Daniel could not safely carry on.

Daniel’s devastated family launched an online petition - which clocked up 6,000 signatures in one week world-wide - calling on the Coventry-based company to keep Daniel on.

His mother Rachel Williams said: 'I just think it is absolutely cruel. They are discriminating against him.

'He has done that job for 27 years and they can’t even be bothered to give him the time of day or negotiate.

'I can’t stand by and see him lose this job. It’s all he knows and he absolutely loves it.

'Everyone says how hardworking he is. He does all the hand-cutting of the grass, keeps the children’s play areas clear, and does the litter picking.

'The men that he works with have been wonderful and they say they stand by him.

'He has worked with so many people over the years and he has been there the longest.

'He said to me the other day, "mum, I don’t think I’m ever going to get over this," and it broke my heart.'

Hardworking Daniel was hired by Shepton Mallet Town Council as an assistant in the park in 1986 and when private company Quadron took over in 2002 they kept him on.

But last November Landscape Group won the council’s contract to look after the park in a joint bid with Mendip District Council.

Now, instead of a park ranger and an assistant looking after individual parks, workers will be part of larger teams covering a wider area.

Daniel - who finds communication extremely difficult - cannot drive and support workers said it would not be safe for him to work in some locations.

Daniel’s mum has been told he will have to leave his job in around 11 weeks time.

Well-wishers around the world are urged Landscape Group to change their mind.

The dedicated groundsman works full time for minimum wage

An online petition, launched by Daniel’s sister-in-law Hannah Sumption has attracted 5,800 signatures in just a week from as far afield as Florida, Italy and Australia.

Marissa Cavaliere, from Australia, wrote: 'We need to support people with disabilities by enabling them to continue working and supporting themselves.

'No doubt this job gave this man a lot of satisfaction having been there for such a substantial number of years and to now for him to be made redundant is awful.'

Sophia Ahmed, from Glasgow, added: 'With all this commitment and hard work, this should be credited.

'As a man with learning difficulties, he is able to get up and ready every day to work without time off or late comings.

'This should be commendable. Not redundancy! This has to be rethought!'

Rachel, who is Daniel’s carer, added: 'It’s so overwhelming. It is amazing to know we have such support. It really helps.

'I couldn’t put him in a factory or a production line. Daniel loves being outside and even on his weekends he loves going for a walk. He couldn’t be indoors, he just couldn’t.'

Landscape Group Ltd said it spent 12 months trying to find a place for Daniel 'Within the contract and beyond which could offer a safe working environment in line with this employee’s needs.'

The company said Daniel’s job no longer exists now the neighbourhood teams have been introduced.

A spokesman said: 'At every step of the process, the employee’s health, safety and happiness was prioritised and we engaged with specialist services as well as the employee’s family to ensure everyone was fully involved.

'We regret that we have had to lose this employee and wish them all the best in their future employment.'
