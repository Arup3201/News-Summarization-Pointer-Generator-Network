Millions of online shoppers will log on today as the traditional Boxing Day sales start two days early.

The clamour for the best deals began as early as 6am when the first major retailer started to slash its prices.

Other stores were joining in during the day with deals of up to 70 per cent off in a battle for sales after an unexpected slowdown in spending.

The frenzy will continue through Christmas Day, when cyber-shoppers are expected to spend a record £636million – or £441,000 a minute – in the hunt for online bargains.

The number of visits to internet stores tomorrow will soar to 142million, a 25 per cent jump from last year, Britain’s online retailer association the IMRG predicts. But industry experts warned the vicious discounting war could be bad news for struggling retailers as their profits fall.

Debenhams’ sale went live from 6am, with John Lewis, Next, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and many more launching theirs throughout today.

There are hundreds of half-price deals on everything from lingerie to furniture. Some shops are so desperate to shift winter stock, particularly coats, woollen clothes, hats and boots, that they are cutting prices by as much as 70 per cent.

The Black Friday and Cyber Monday events did not encourage customers to spend more but simply brought forward much of the shopping normally done closer to Christmas, analysts said

The biggest bargains include a Krups coffee machine worth £149.99 sold for half price at House of Fraser; a £1,499 LG television reduced by 47 per cent to £799 at Currys PC World; and a £200 ten-piece stainless steel pan set on sale for just £60, or 70 per cent less, at Debenhams.

Stores have been shifting their bargains earlier each year and this year’s pre-Christmas discounts come as panicking high street shops try to bump up profits and shift stock after a disappointing December for many.

The Black Friday and Cyber Monday events at the end of November, when many stores slashed prices for a short time, did not encourage customers to spend more but simply brought forward much of the shopping normally done closer to Christmas, analysts said.

This means there have been fewer shoppers on the high street in recent weeks than this time last year.

John Lewis revealed yesterday that its sales over the last week – normally a particularly lucrative time – were down by 2.4 per cent from the 2013 figures. It said a big fall in sales of home electricals, such as TVs, was a direct reflection of the impact of Black Friday.

And chocolate chain Thorntons has issued a profit warning following a slump in orders of its products from supermarkets.

Industry analysts Ipsos Retail Performance said there has been a total fall of 1.8 per cent in shoppers at non-food stores in the past week compared with last year.

Julie Palmer, of business consultants Begbies Traynor, said: ‘This negative trend spells bad tidings for retailers large and small who don’t have John Lewis’s brand and promotional budget to fall back on.

‘As Christmas shoppers move online for the best deals and appear to be buying less for less, all UK retailers have been drawn into a vicious discounting war, slashing prices and therefore profit margins in a bid to compete.

‘With John Lewis dampening down expectations and Thorntons announcing the sector’s first profit warning before Christmas trading has even concluded, I think it’s safe to say we can expect to see some high-profile casualties come 2015.’

John Lewis saw an annual increase in sales of fashion, homeware and small electricals such as Nespresso coffee machines, but it is banking on a last-minute rush to hit its Christmas sales targets.

Retail director Andrew Murphy said: ‘We have seen a building trend of customers leaving their gift purchases right up until the last minute … Our partners are standing ready for a very busy final trading day before the festive break.’ The IMRG’s Tina Spooner said: ‘Some 70 per cent of e-retailers offered discounts and promotions over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend and we are likely to see a higher number launching sales over Christmas and Boxing Day.’
