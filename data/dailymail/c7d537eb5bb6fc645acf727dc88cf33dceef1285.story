An autistic 11-year-old boy is dead and his parents burned after the 46-foot sailboat they called home ignited into an horrific blaze of unimaginable consequence Sunday morning.

Brian Birely, 59, and Karen Laake, 53, were unable to pull their son--and youngest child--Charlie from the inferno started by an unknown source and made far worse when a propane tank ignited.

The explosion could be heard all the way to the Stuart, Florida shore. Police rushed to the scene, but were unable to get close because of intense heat. 

Tragic inferno: A couple managed to scramble to safety as this 46-foot sailboat they call home was engulfed by flames. Their 11-year-old autistic son was not as lucky

Horrible: Brian Birely, 59, and Karen Laake, 53, were unable to pull their son--and youngest child--Charlie from the inferno started by an unknown source and made far worse when a propane tank ignited.

'Officers approached the engulfed sailboat from the Stuart Police Boat and attempted to rescue anyone that may have been on board. Due to the extreme heat coming from the fire, officers were unable to go aboard and attempt a rescue,' police spokesman Officer Brian Bossio said in a prepared statement. 

Birely and Laake managed to make it to a small dinghy and then to shore with the help of a nearby boat.

The couple was taken to a Miami hospital for treatment. 

Frank Pagnini lives on the land in Stuart near where the couple were often anchor in the St. Lucie River estuary and says he knew the family and routinely saw them plying the waters.

'Thrown debris a good distance probably. A full size propane tank exploding, people heard it down at the park,' a neighbor said. 'It was fully engulfed, front to back, the mast had already melted off'
