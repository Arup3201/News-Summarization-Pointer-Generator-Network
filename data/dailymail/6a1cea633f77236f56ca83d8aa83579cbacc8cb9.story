A British husband and father has been killed on the Caribbean island of St Lucia after he was hit by a car while crossing the road.

Quinton Garrathy, 38, a Virgin Atlantic crew member of 15 years, was crossing the road near the island's Rodney Bay Marina when he was hit by a Black Hyundai about 1.30am on Sunday morning.

Mr Garrathy, who was originally from 
Southampton, had been out eating and drinking with friends before making
 the trip back to his hotel when he was killed.

Mr and Mrs Garrathy were both crew members for Virgin Atlantic and married in July last year

He leaves behind his wife Naomi, who is also a Virgin Atlantic crew member, and their three-month-old daughter.

The couple married in July last year and only recently celebrated their one year anniversary together.

Today Mr Garrathy's Facebook page was inundated with messages from friends, expressing their sadness at the news of his death.

He was described as a 'top bloke', 'legend' and 'a star'.

One wrote: 'So saddened to hear the news. R.I.P. Quinton. My thoughts go out to your family. Another start taken too soon. You will be sorely missed by everybody who knew you.'

Another added: 'RIP Quin. You will be missed, my heart goes out to your family Naomi and beautiful little girl.'

Mr Garrathy was making his way back to his hotel after a night out with colleagues when he was hit

A Virgin Atlantic crew member told the St Lucia News Mr Garrathy and other crew members had been eating and drinking at the Royal St. Lucia resort in Rodney Bay, Gros Islet.

The source suggested he may have missed his bus stop and was crossing the road to get back to his hotel when he was hit, or had visited one of the nearby food vans.

Eighteen-year-old Sebastien King, who is the son of the island's lead pathologist, was taken into 
police custody in relation to the accident where he gave a statement before being released.
