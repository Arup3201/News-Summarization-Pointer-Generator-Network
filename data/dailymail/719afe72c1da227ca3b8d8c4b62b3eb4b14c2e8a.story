A Texas nanny was busy changing a little girl's diaper Monday when she was shocked to hear a stranger's voice come over the baby monitor.

As professional baby sitter Ashley Stanley, of Houston, quickly discovered, someone had hacked into the surveillance system installed inside her employers' home and was now spying on the woman and her 1-year-old charge, Samantha.

Stanley said at first she heard a strange noise in Samantha's room, but initially she could not identify its source.

Peeping Tom: Someone had hacked into the surveillance system installed inside her employers' home and was now spying on Stanley and her 1-year-old charge, Samantha

Idle chatter: The hacker made some comments about the toddler and her 'poopy diaper,' and even urged Stanley to password-protect the camera  

A short time later, the unsuspecting nanny was startled by a man's disembodied voice talking to her and making comments about her actions.

Stanley's first thought was that her employers were playing a prank on her, but she quickly realized that was not the case.

'They kept telling me that it's a cute baby and 'wow, that is a poopy diaper,' Stanley told the station KPRC. 'I was like, 'My goodness, are they watching me like right now?'

The nanny said the brazen intruder went so far as to tell her that she should password-protect the camera. 

The security system manufactured by a company called Foscam was installed by Samantha's parents so they could remotely keep an eye on their toddler at work via their smartphones.

The small round camera is trained on Samantha's crib and can be manipulated to survey the entire room and even the hallway.

The family were under the impression that the camera could only be accessed on a mobile app when the owners' phones were on the network, but apparently it was not so.

Foscam COO Chase Rhymes told the station KHOU their customers are always urged to change the default password and username upon purchasing a camera.

It appears that the person who snooped on Ashley Stanley and little Samantha Monday hacked into the surveillance system, which may constitute a federal crime.

Since the incident , Stanley and the toddler's parents have unplugged the camera to make sure no one spies on their child.

Creepy: The website insecam.com is running footage from more than 73,000 cameras round the world including this kitchen

Disturbing: Security experts say members of the internet need to beware of the pitfalls of the internet. This camera is positioned over a baby's crib but the adults bed can be clearly seen

Webcam snooping made headlines in November when it was revealed that the website Insecam has collected streaming footage from more than 73,000 cameras around the world that are connected to the Internet, and whose owners have not had their default passwords changed.

The Peeping Tom-esque site claims to feature feeds from IP cameras all over the world with more than 11,000 in the U.S. and 2,400 in the UK alone, among them nannycams.

It makes it easy to peek into hundreds of strangers' homes at the click of a button.
