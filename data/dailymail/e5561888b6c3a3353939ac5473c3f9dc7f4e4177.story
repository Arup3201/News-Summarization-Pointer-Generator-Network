Kate Moss may be in recovery mode after the epic celebration that marked her 40th birthday - which started last Thursday and only concluded last night – but that doesn’t mean her career is on a break too.

The mother-of-one shows off her lean legs and a fresh face as she models in the newly-released pre-Spring/Summer 2014 campaign for Liu Jo.

In the behind-the-scenes video Kate can be seen posing as her hair and clothes are positioned to perfect the look.

This is the supermodel's third year as the face of Italian fashion brand Liu Jo and she looks as beautiful as ever in the shots

This is the third year Kate has modelled for the Italian fashion brand, most recently fronting their Fall/Winter 2013-14 campaign, shot by Solve Sundsbo in a London loft, with against the capital’s skyline acting as the backdrop.

The supermodel celebrated her milestone birthday with cocktails and champagne at the exclusive 34 restaurant in London's Mayfair alongside Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Nick Grimshaw, fashion designer John Galliano, and photographer Mario Testino.

Kate then moved the party out of London, speeding away from the capital with her husband Jamie Hince in the £20,000 vintage Porsche Carrera that had been given to the model as a 40th birthday present by billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green.

Guests arrived at the model’s £2m, 
ten-bedroom Cotswold home on Saturday, to continue the celebrations that
 had started on Thursday afternoon at 4pm.

The last survivors of her mammoth four-day party left the star’s country home last night, following a Glastonbury-themed bash that was expected to have cost the star more than £100,000.
