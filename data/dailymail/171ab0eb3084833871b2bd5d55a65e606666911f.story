Rescuers have called off the search for the small private plane that passed its Florida destination and traveled on a ghostly journey before crashing into the sea off Jamaica.

Yesterday, both the Jamaican military and the U.S. Coast Guard decided to suspend air-and-sea searches for the single-engine plane carrying New York couple Larry and Jane Glazer.

The plane flew on its own for 1,700 miles last Friday - after Mr Glazer apparently lost consciousness at the controls - before running out of fuel and crashing into deep waters some 14 miles off Port Antonio on Jamaica's northeast coast.

U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Todd Coggeshall, chief of response management, said the agency called off search-and-rescue operations with 'extremely great care and deliberation'. 

He said a decision is made to suspend a search only after the 'area is saturated several times with a maximum number of assets, resources and crew effort, and persons in distress are still not located'. 

Later Sunday, Major Basil Jarrett said the Jamaica Defense Force ended its sea search after reassessing the diminishing probability of having any success. 

But he stressed that the Caribbean country's military 'will be vigilant along the coastline to see if any debris washes up' in coming days. 

After scouring an expanse of  waters off Jamaica, early Saturday morning Jamaican officials said a search and rescue team had spotted and photographed 'what is believed to be debris' from the wreckage of the crashed aircraft. 

But the floating material had apparently sunk before search and rescue team were able to recover the debris, and it was no longer visible later that day.

The plane, which took off from New York on Friday morning, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida

The plane, which took off from New York on Friday morning, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida.

It continued flying south for several hours at an altitude of 25,000 feet before entering Cuban airspace - triggering a U.S. security alert - and heading towards the Caribbean.

Larry Glazer, a real estate developer in Rochester, New York, was seen slumped over the controls by a fighter jet sent to escort the plane. He and his entrepreneur wife Jane, both 68, were experienced pilots.

The single-engine plane, which was traveling from New York to Florida, failed to land, entered Cuban airspace and headed towards the Caribbean. It crashed just off Jamaica on Friday after running out of fuel

One of the fighter jet pilots said he could see the pilot of the small plane, a SOCATA TBM 700, which has a pressurized cabin, was still alive.

'I can see his chest rising and falling,' he said in a recording of his dispatch. 'Right before I left... we could see that he was actually breathing.'

The plane also had 'frosted windows', an indication of a sudden loss of cabin pressure and officials said they suspected hypoxia - a deprivation of oxygen - could have caused them to pass out.

The single-engine plane eventually went down in the water 14 miles North East of Port Antonio in Portland

According to ABC, the pilot requested to fly lower during two calls to air traffic control, however when they asked if he wanted to declare himself in a state of emergency, he said no.

The plane was flying at 28,000ft at 10 am when Glazer asked to descend to 18,000ft because of an issue with the plane. He was cleared to drop to 25,000ft but then asked to go lower.

The unresponsive plane flown by Larry Glazer was a SOCATA TBM 700, a single-engine turbo-prop with a pressurized cabin that is used as a light business and utility aircraft.

Seats: Seven including pilot and co-pilot

Max cruising speed: 345mph (300 knots)

Max certificated altitude: 30,000ft

Wing span: 41 feet, 6 inches

Length: 34 feet, 9 inches

History: Built by American and French engineers. Been in production since 1988 but periodic upgrades have boosted its horsepower and speed

Production: More than 125 worldwide 

Air traffic control denied the second request because of the traffic traveling below Glazer. They said if he made a left turn he could bypass the traffic and descend. He made the turn, but then stopped responding. 

Experts say cases of pilots becoming unresponsive while their planes wander the sky are unusual, with probably not much more than a handful of such incidents over the last decade. 

Jamaican rescuers yesterday shut down an emergency operation center in Port Antonio, an off-the-beaten-track place with a smattering of luxury villas.

The next steps for locating the New York couple's remains or wreckage from their single-engine turboprop Socata TBM700 were not immediately clear. The Caribbean waters where the high-performance plane went down has depths of roughly 6,560 feet.

Jamaica Coast Guard Commander Antonette Wemyss-Gorman said it was 'beyond our capacities locally' to recover wreckage at such depths.

But Leroy Lindsay, director general of Jamaica's civil aviation authority, said that French authorities have volunteered equipment and expertise is raising wreckage of the French-made plane if it is ever located on the sea floor.

The plane, a Socata TBM-700 light business and utility aircraft, was registered to a development, Buckingham Properties, which is owned by Glazer.

A company bio for Glazer notes: 'Larry spends some of his spare time on the ground - gardening around his house with his wife, Jane; and some in the sky - flying his plane.'

An article about Glazer in the Rochester City Newspaper called him 'downtown's patron saint'.

His company 'owns, co-owns, or manages nearly 13 million square feet of real estate space', it says.

Jane Glazer was herself an entrepreneur, setting up and running QCI Direct, which delivers home care items through catalogs and websites.

The couple, who met at camp at Seneca Lake when they were both counselors in 1964, had been married for more than 45 years and were considered stalwarts of the community.

'The City of Rochester has lost two heroes,' Mayor Lovely Warren and City Council President Loretta Scott said in a statement.

'It is difficult to put into words how much Larry Glazer has meant to our community. Larry worked hard to return a sense of vitality and excitement to our Center City.

'His efforts helped to lift our spirits and restore our sense of optimism. He has been a treasured friend and partner.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Glazer family, the partners and employees of Buckingham Properties, and all of Larry's many friends.'
