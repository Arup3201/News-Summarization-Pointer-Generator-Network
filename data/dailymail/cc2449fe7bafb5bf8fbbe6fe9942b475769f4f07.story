Music really is the food of love, scientists have found.

A woman's musical taste changes when she is at her most fertile, making her more responsive to men who are able to produce more complex music.

The study, carried out at the University of Sussex, suggest that women only preferred better musicians as short-term lovers - not as long-term partners.

The research support naturalist Charles Darwin's theory that music's primary function is in sexual courtship.

The study, published today by the Royal Society, might suggest why creative individuals are considered so desirable for short-term sexual relationships.

Benjamin Charlton, the paper's author, said: 'The findings of this study provide the first support for Darwin's original contention that music evolved via sexual selection.

'These results suggest that women may acquire genetic benefits for offspring by selecting musicians able to create more complex music as sexual partners.'

Dr Charlton's study of nearly 1,500 women, with an average age of 28 years, who were not breastfeeding, pregnant or using hormonal contraception, involved two experiments.

Women were asked to choose which of four thematically similar piano compositions, played by music software, was the most complex. The melodies progressed from a few chords and a simple rhythm to a greater variety of chords and a syncopated, off-beat rhythm.

Another group of women were asked whether they would prefer the composer of the first simple or second more complex melody, either as a short-term sexual partner, or a longer-term partner in a committed relationship.

Nature: Charles Darwin argued that birdsong and human music, having no other clear role in survival, must have had a role in sexual selection

The results showed that women only preferred composers of more complex music as short-term sexual partners at the point in their menstrual cycle when the chance of conception was at its highest.

No preference was shown when women chose which composer they would prefer as a long-term partner in a committed relationship, the results revealed.

The role of music in human evolution has long been a mystery to scientists.

Charles Darwin argued that birdsong and human music, having no other clear role in survival, must have had a role in sexual selection.

Whereas the role of music in the natural world has been accepted by zoologists, this is the first study that supports Darwin's views of music in human reproduction.

Dr Charlton said: 'The ability to create complex music could be indicative of advanced cognitive abilities.

'Consequently, women may acquire genetic benefits for offspring by selecting musicians able to create more complex music as sexual partners.' He said: 'I suggest that music may have manifested itself in courtship contexts by allowing both men and women to display specific adaptive qualities.

'For instance, the ability to play an instrument could reflect excellent physical condition and learning capacity.

'Men and women may also have sung to each other to show how they can improvise novel melodies and perhaps display their creativity and ability to innovate.'

But he added: 'Because women did not prefer composers of more complex music as long-term partners, however, it appears that the ability to produce complex musical sounds does not reflect skills valued in long-term mates, ie. increased ability to acquire material benefits such as food and shelter.'

Success: A separate study published last year found that playing music to an egg in a dish in an IVF lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent

A separate study published last year found that playing music to an egg in a dish in an IVF lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent.

Researchers from the Marques Institute fertility clinic in Barcelona said the tiny vibrations produced by the music helped fertilisation.

Pop, classical and heavy metal tracks were all equally good, the scientists found.
