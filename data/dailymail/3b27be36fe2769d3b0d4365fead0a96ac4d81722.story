Villagers from the birthplace of 19th century painter Gustave Courbet have clubbed together with the French government to raise €4million to buy back one of his paintings.

'The Oak of Flagey', unveiled at the Courbet Museum today, depicts a large oak tree that once stood in the eastern France village of Flagey.

Approximately 1,500 people contributed to the fund, with donations ranging from five euros to several thousand euros.

during the first day of its exhibition today after French villagers 
helped the government raise €4million

It
 succeeded in raising a total of 265,000 euros (£230,827) to which 
businesses, along with local and national-level government bodies 
contributed the remaining money which was given to a Japanese collector in exchange for the painting.

France’s ministry of culture classified 
the painting as 'a heritage work of major interest', and gave donors a 
tax break on their contributions.

Parallels have been drawn between the tree and the painter himself, who was said to be 'rooted' in the land.

Claude Jeannerot, a local socialist senator 
  behind the campaign to buy the painting told the Daily Telegraph:'There will always be scrooges who will say that in 
the current financial context it’s too expensive, but it’s an economic 
investment in the territory: the arrival of tourists brings life and 
therefore, jobs,” said Mr Jeannerot.

In
 the fourth quarter of last year unemployment in France climbed to a 
14-year high as businesses cut thousands of jobs in order to stay afloat
 during the stalled economic recovery.

Gustave Courbet is heralded as the artist who led the 19th century Realist movement and influenced greats such as Claude Monet

'This shows that in this 
world where things aren’t going well, where economic difficulties are a 
reality - culture must remain an important value,' he said.

Last month it emerged that an amateur art-lover stands to earn up
 to £35million after unearthing the missing head that goes with a 
woman’s naked body in another of Courbet's paintings.

The Origin Of The World, displayed in one of Paris’s most 
prestigious museums, the Musee d’Orsay, depicts female genitalia.

Until
 now it has only showed the body but experts believe the missing head 
has been uncovered after the anonymous art buff bought it for just 
£1,200 at a furniture shop.

He is said to have knocked down the asking price by a sixth.

French magazine Paris Match
 revealed that the collector made the accidental discovery of 
the head while looking through bric-a-brac back in 2010.

Gustave Courbet is heralded as artist who led the 19th century Realist movement and influenced greats such as Claude Monet. 

His
 work is displayed at some of the most prestigious galleries in the 
world, including the Musee d'Orsay, in Paris and Metropolitan Museum of 
Art.

Born to a wealthy 
farming family in 1819, Courbet learned to draw by using his sister's as
 subjects before moving to Paris in 1839.

There he developed his own style by observing the reality around him.

After
 winning national plaudits for his work such as After Dinner at Omans 
and Stone-Breakers, he gained notoriety for his detailed depictions of 
female genitalia in The Origin of the World. 

It was deemed so scandalous that it was not publicly displayed until 1988. 

Scandal
 also followed other paintings such as Young Ladies on the Banks of the 
Seine, which showed two prostitutes, and Sleep, which depicts two nude 
women in bed.  

He was an 
established artists in France but in 1871 he was jailed for his part in 
inciting the Paris Commune's dismantling of the Vendome Column. 

He spent six months in prison and was fined 500 francs. Courbet died in 1877, aged 58, in Switzerland.
