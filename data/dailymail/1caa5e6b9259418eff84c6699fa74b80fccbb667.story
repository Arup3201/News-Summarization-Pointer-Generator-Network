Homicide in paradise: Carl Yerger, 45, was found stabbed to death at a Bahamas resort early Friday morning and two fishing boat crew members are suspected of carrying out the crime

Two fishing boat workers are suspected of stabbing to death a 45-year-old father of two whose body was discovered at a Bahamas resort this weekend.

Carl Yerger of Ruscombmanor Township, Pennsylvania was in the Bahamas on a business trip when his body was discovered with several stab wounds on the grounds of the Bimini Big Game Club Resort & Marina early Friday morning.

Two men working on a boat docked at the resort's marina were arrested in connection with Yerger's death and arraigned on manslaughter charges Tuesday in Nassau, though those charges could be upgraded to murder after authorities finish their investigation.

Gaylordsville, Connecticut-native Robert Schwartz, 62, and 19-year-old Tyler Valles, of Key Largo, Florida, were 'subdued' and 'quiet' as they were lead into court handcuffed together, a journalist for ZNS-TV reported.

The attorney representing the two suspects said Yerger was killed in an accident, after the milling-company owner wandered drunk onto their boat.

Valles and Schwartz say Yerger came on the boat earlier that day and had been told to leave.

An intoxicated Yerger later returned to the boat and a 'struggle' ensued between the three men.

Initially four men were arrested in connection to Yerger's killing, but two were released pending the investigation.

Scene of the crime: Yerger's body was found at the Bimini Big Game Club Resort where he was staying and where the two suspects had their boat moored

Fisherman: A friend of Valles described him as a 'quiet' and 'popular' young man who stayed out of trouble and had a passion for fishing. Authorities say Schwartz and Valles worked on a fishing boat together

Police have not released a motive for Yerger's killing yet.

A friend of Valles was surprised to hear of the teen's arrest.

Valles graduated in 2013 from Coral Shores High School and was on the honor roll.

His friend told KeysInfoNet that Valles was a 'quiet' and 'popular' young man who stayed out of trouble and had a passion for fishing.

Family torn apart: Yerger leaves behind a wife and two young sons. His family have set up a college fund for the two boys

Valles has no arrest record in Monroe County.

Yerger leaves behind wife Rebecca and their sons Ty, 10, and Tate, 7.

'He was a wonderful man. He will be missed,' Yerger's wife of 16 years told Philly.com.

She says he was visitng the island for business but planned to do some fishing as well. He was staying at the same resort where his body was found.

Bimini is a popular destination for deep-sea fishing and is located approximately 50 miles off the Florida coast.

Piecing together the mystery: The manslaughter charges against Valles and Schwartz could be upgraded to murder pending the investigation. Above, another picture of Valles from his Facebook

In addition to running his milling business, Yerger volunteered as the president of the Oley Valley Youth Sports League.

The league issued a statement following news of Yerger's passing, saying he 'inspired everyone he met and energized the small but tight-knit sports community of Oley'.

Yerger's funeral is scheduled for March 26 and his family has set up a college fund for his two young sons.
