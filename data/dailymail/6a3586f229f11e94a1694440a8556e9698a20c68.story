A man from the NSW Hunter region who killed a litter of puppies by smashing them over the head with a rock has been slapped with an extra nine animal cruelty charges.

It comes amidst news that the sole pup to survive the attack, nicknamed 'Lucky', is 'stable'.

Earlier this month an advertisement was posted on website Gumtree selling a litter of bull terrier puppies.

When the 11 pups failed to sell in a week, the seller offered them for free, police said at the time.

The only pup to have survived the attack on a litter of bull terriers near New Castle last month -nicknamed 'Lucky' is doing well in RSPCA care

Police allege Nathan Thompson, 25, collected the animals on March 11 and took them to bushland at Kurri Kurri, near Newcastle.

It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock before throwing them into the bush.

The witness confronted the man, who drove away from the area.

An RSPCA inspector was called to the bushland and found five dead pups and another two still clinging to life.

'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia.

'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there.

'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.'

The only pup to survive the ordeal has since been named 'Lucky' and is being cared for by the RSPCA, who last week confirmed she was doing well.

'There are rumours flying around about Lucky, the sole survivor of the horrible animal cruelty case in Kurri Kurri last week, that she isn't doing well. We are happy to quell these rumours and let you know that she is still stable and under close veterinary surveillance,' the RSPCA wrote on their Facebook page.

'Her condition has not deteriorated. If her condition does change, we will let the community know.'

Thompson fronted court earlier this month and pleaded guilty to three animal cruelty charges and resisting arrest.

On Thursday he pleaded guilty to another nine animal cruelty offences.

He was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade.

Thompson will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail following his first charges, saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend.

'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said.

He added that he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated.
