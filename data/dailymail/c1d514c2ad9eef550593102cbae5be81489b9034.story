For many retired couples, paying the dreaded energy bill leaves little left-over at the end of the month.

But pensioners Dan and Jane Fish have managed to slash their bill to an incredible £3 a month after researching the latest ways to cut their usage.

A solar hot water system, a wood burner and solar panels have all helped the couple to cut their energy bills.

The real Good Life: Dan and Jane Fish have spent thousands of pounds renovating their bungalow in a bid to achieve the ultimate 'carbon-neutral' green lifestyle

The greenest couple in Britain? The couple have a garden full of fruit and vegetables

Mr Fish, 77, started looking into ways to save money on their energy bills when he and his wife started having money problems 37 years ago.

‘It was a time of economic uncertainty in my industry,’ said Mr Fish, a semi-retired naval architect.

‘I was a hovercraft engineer and there didn’t seem like there was a future in it at that time.

‘We had three children, and I thought things would be quite bleak with all of us and little money.’

In a bid to save money, the couple renovated their bungalow in the New Forest to include a solar hot water system, a wood burner and solar panels which produce more electricity than they use.

They also have a solar-powered car and grow their own fruit and vegetables - all their money-saving essentials have helped them reduce their bills to almost nothing.

The only gas they use is for their stove, and their amazing bill of around £3 a month includes the annexe they rent out as a holiday home.

Reminiscent of the TV series The Good Life, which hit the screens in 1975, the couple started their quest to become self-sufficient in the 1970s.

They decided to sell their home and buy a larger one in the New Forest where they could keep livestock and grow their own food.

But now, their innovations are no longer about saving pounds but saving the planet, and are part of a whole green lifestyle.

Dubbed ‘Britain’s greenest couple’, Mr and Mrs Fish never fly, and Mr Fish, even celebrated his 70th birthday with a cycling holiday from his home in Hampshire to Dundee, Scotland.

Mr Fish said: ‘We went in for self-sufficiency in a big way.’ 

‘We had a cow, pigs, chickens, sheep and grew masses of vegetables - it was hard work but great fun.’ 

Some of the self-sufficiency aspects have now gone - they found they didn’t have time to keep animals any longer.

Although their initial motivation was to save money, as the couple learnt more about global warming they became increasingly concerned about their own impact on the environment.

Mr Fish added: ‘The science is quite clear - for the world to halt climate change it needs a 100 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide by 2050.’ 

When he semi-retired around ten years ago the couple decided to step up their efforts to live a zero-carbon lifestyle.

They estimate they are somewhere between 90 and 99 per cent carbon-free.

On the couple’s decision to give up travelling by planes, Mrs Fish, 79, a retired music teacher, said: ‘We don’t want to feel we are killing people while we travel.’ 

‘Our last flight was to see family in Canada about ten years ago - we came back by cargo ship.

‘The return journey took us a week and it was expensive - it cost about three times as much as flying - but it was lovely.’ 

Since then their holidays have involved travelling by ferry, train, bus, cargo ship and bicycle - which is how they got to the Greek island of Crete.

The couple admit they are fortunate to be able to put their environmentally friendly methods in place, but hope to inspire others to reduce their carbon footprints.

Admittedly some of their projects have incurred costs, while others have been time-consuming, but for Britain’s greenest couple that’s not what is important.

Mr Fish added: ‘It gives one a nice feeling when you have a hot shower on a cold winter morning and know the water has been heated by the sun.

‘I claim that’s a completely different tingle!’
