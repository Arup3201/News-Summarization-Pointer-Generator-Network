The awkward interplay between 12 Years A Slaveâ€™s screenwriter and director at last nightâ€™s Oscars has sparked rumors of a rift at the heart of the movie that was the star of the night.

Director Steve McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley looked less than pleased to see each other do well, with a series of apparent snubs to each other as the statues were given out.

As Ridley was announced as the winner of best screenplay, McQueen gave a stilted slow hand clap as the rest of the room burst into applause.

And  in return, Ridley gave McQueen a very clear cold shoulder as he bypassed the film's director completely when he went towards the stage.

Moving right past: As John Ridley went on stage to collect his screenwriting Oscar, he did not stop and hug anyone related to the film who were all sitting in front of him, including director Steve McQueen (right)

Clear slight: Rather than hug anyone related to the film, including star Michael Fassbender of mega producer Harvey Weinstein, Ridley went across the aisle and gave American Hustle director David O. Russell a hug

Rather than give a brief hug or handshake
 to McQueen or anyone else related to the project who were all sitting 
directly in front of him, Ripley gave his only hug (aside from his wife 
Gayle) to American Hustle director David O. Russell who was sitting 
across the aisle.

He also gave Meryl Street a pat on the
 back as he headed up the steps but his warmth ended there as he did not
 mention McQueen in his acceptance speech.

He paid respects to the film's producers 'Mr Brad Pitt' and Jeremy Kleiner. 

McQueen
 should have taken acting cues from his cast as well, as the 
British-born director did an unenthusiastic palm clap and failed to even
 smile throughout the ordeal.

When it was his turn to speak as the film won Best Picture, McQueen did not mention Ridley either.

On the outside: Ridley stood at the back and didn't interact with any of the other members of the film's team during their Best Picture acceptance

Suggestions that a feud may be brewing between the two men were immediate.

Entertainment
 reporter Nikki Finke was the first to suggest a reason, hinting that 
McQueen may have been vying for a screenwriting credit of his own.

'My sources attributing John 
Ridley-Steve McQueen cold shoulder at Oscars tonight to dispute over 
screenplay credit,' she wrote on Twitter.

12 Years A Slave is McQueen's third feature film, after Hunger and Shame.

Walking right past: Ridley didn't acknowledge Lupita Nyong'o or producer Brad Pitt, but only giving Pitt a mention during his speech when he was on stage

Bizarre: Rather than smile, McQueen only gave Ridley an unenthusiastic open-palm clap, and it is now rumored that he wanted a credit as a co-writer for the film like he has received in his last two pictures

Stoic: McQueen was effusive when Lupita Nyong'o won Best Supporting Actress but showed no such love for Ridley, only giving this perfunctory clap as he walked towards the stage

Serious moment: While Ridley thanked the film's producers 'Mr Brad Pitt' and Jeremy Kleiner, he did not mention McQueen at all even though they had been working on the project together since 2008

He
 was credited as a co-writer and director in both of those films, and in
 this latest one he was only listed as the director and one of the 
producers.

As Ridley mentioned in his speech, he 
started his Hollywood career by writing for sitcoms including Martin 
Lawrence's eponymous show and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

His first film was the poorly-received Sean Penn thriller U Turn that he co-wrote with director Oliver Stone.

In
 1999, he wrote David O. Russell's film Three Kings, which may explain 
why he went out of his way to hug his former collaborator on Sunday 
night.

He then took a thematic turn, writing the 2002 comedy Undercover Brother.

At the back: Ridley was one of the last ones on stage when they won Best Picture and he hid behind the cast

Rolling his eyes? Photos show that he was not smiling nor enthused at what is widely considered the night's biggest award but may have even been making light of the win

Standing apart: Ridley physically removed himself from the group

Returning the favor: When McQueen gave a speech as the film won Best Picture, he did not mention Ridley at all either

More recently he co-wrote the World War II film Red Tails and then wrote and directed the Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is 
By My Side which was released at the Toronto Film Festival in September 
and will be on screens more widely this summer.

Career high: Ridley started out by writing for sitcoms like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

Ridley has told how he and McQueen started talking about doing a slave-era project together in 2008 and he told IndieWire that it was McQueen's wife who found the Solomon Northup story to use as the baseline.

'Steve said, "I really wanted to tell a 
story about that time and place and the slave era in America but I 
wanted to have a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade 
in slavery, someone who had artistic abilities and who had station but 
found themselves in a different geographical location. Something that 
has scope and scale emotionally,"' according to Ridley.

'Working with Steve was difficult only
 with the geography. He lives in Amsterdam and I live in Los Angeles and
 in that time period "Shame" came together for him and "All Is By My 
Side" came together for me but we both thought that this was something 
worth doing.'

In addition to
 taking home three of the biggest Oscars, 12 Years A Slave also had a 
successful night on Saturday at the Independent Spirit Awards winning 
Best Feature, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Female, and 
Cinematography.

Distancing himself: McQueen looked as if he was actively trying to avert his eyes so as not to look at Ridley

What a difference: When they won for Best Picture, however, he was literally jumping for joy

Mixed reactions: Ridley did not seem happy to greet Angelina Jolie, whose partner Brad Pitt produced his film, but was much more interested in talking to Sidney Poitier backstage

Ridley was said to have become emotional during his speech and even went so far as to mention McQueen in his speech at the event, calling the director 'fun'.

'As much as I thought the memoir in Solomon's words was special I had no idea what I was a part of until I saw the film in Toronto,' he said.

Ridley went on to give a shout out to Julie Deply, who was nominated as a co-writer for Before Midnight.

For his part, McQueen chose to highlight the talents of Michael Fassbender, who has been in every one of his three movies including 12 Years A Slave- but showed no such love for Ridley.
