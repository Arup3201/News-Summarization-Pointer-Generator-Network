With the World Cup coming to a close, excitement in building for the new Premier League season. Here, MailSport looks at the top targets for every top-flight club:

Nice goalkeeper David Ospina is a £4million target with Norwich’s John Ruddy an alternative. Sami Khedira's £23m move seems imminent, which may see a £23m move for Leverkusen’s Lars Bender put on the backburner. Southampton right back Calum Chambers is wanted.

Paul Lambert likes Troy Deeney at Watford but they want at least £7m. Free agent Esteban Cambiasso is a midfield option but has other interest too while Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles will cost £6m at least.

Two offers made for Deeney. Boss Sean Dyche has bid also £1.5m for Middlesbrough’s Lukas Jutkiewicz,  while West Brom defender Craig Dawson wants to join but Albion are reluctant to sell.

Jose Mourinho was confident of persuading Sami Khedira to join from Real Madrid for £20m but the player seems to favour Arsenal. Left back Filipe Luis should join from Atletico Madrid for £18m. Trump card could be the return of Didier Drogba on a free.

Tony Pulis hopes to snatch Steven Caulker of Cardiff from QPR’s grasp for £8m. Talks are ongoing with his clubmate Fraizer Campbell for £750,000. Pulis is a fan of Jonjo Shelvey but Swansea want at least £9m for the midfielder.

Roberto Martinez wants Romelu Lukaku to return from Chelsea but Wolfsburg are rivals. He may try for Demba Ba and Monaco’s Lacina Traore on loan again. He is in talks with Ferencvaros over midfielder Muhamed Besic.

Options: Everton like the look of two Chelsea strikers, Demba Ba and recent loanee Romelu Lukaku

Steve Bruce wants a centre back but Tottenham's Michael Dawson wants to stay in London. Bruce has bid for Dundee United’s much-coveted 20-year-old left back Andy Robertson. Chelsea's central defender Kenneth Omeruo, 20, is among many other options.

A striker is top of Nigel Pearson’s agenda. Leicester have offered up to £7m for Leonardo Ulloa but Brighton want £10m. Connor Wickham, revived at Sunderland, and QPR’s Charlie Austin are alternatives.

Jay Rodriguez of Southampton is fancied as Swansea’s price for Wilfried Bony is rated too high. Loic Remy of QPR is a possibility. Dejan Lovren of Southampton, Ben Davies (Swansea) and Ryan Bertrand (Chelsea) are targets.

Talks are ongoing with £32m Eliaquim Mangala of Porto but he may choose Chelsea or Manchester United, so Mehdi Benatia of Roma is an option. Yaya Toure worries may spark a bid for Paul Pogba of Juventus.

Louis van Gaal wants three defenders. Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen are targets.

They have signed Montpellier midfielder Remy Cabella for £12m. Feyenoord right back Daryl Janmaat has arrived on Tyneside for a medical ahead of a £5m move. Striker Emmanuel Riviere of Monaco will cost £6m

Rio Ferdinand is due for more talks this week ahead of a free transfer. A bid of £5m has been rejected by Ajax for striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson. If Steven Caulker joins Palace, QPR may try for Spurs’ Michael Dawson.

Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry could form part of the deal that takes Calum Chambers to the Emirates. Ronald Koeman also likes Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster, and Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall.

Bojan Krkic of Barcelona - who was on loan at Ajax last season - is the kind of marquee signing Mark Hughes is desperate to make. Norwich’s Nathan Redmond has been discussed but is expensive at £6m while Stuttgart striker Vedad Ibisevic is a possibility.

Gus Poyet wants Jack Rodwell but faces competition from half of the Premier League in wanting to loan the midfielder. Sunderland have asked about QPR’s Charlie Austin and bid for Marcos Alonso at Fiorentina.

Swansea have asked about Troy Deeney, agreed a £4m fee with Monarcas Morelia for Jefferson Montero and are keen to loan Nick Powell from Manchester United. Bosnian midfielder Anel Hadzic has also been discussed.

Tottenham want Wilfried Bony of Swansea for £19m after being rebuffed over Romelu Lukaku. They are also keen on Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton, Swansea’s Ben Davies and Toulouse full back Serge Aurier.

Target: Jack Rodwell is attracting the attention of a large group of clubs, including West Brom and Sunderland

Alan Irvine wants to take Jack Rodwell from Manchester City but only on loan. He has agreed to take Andre Wisdom on loan from Liverpool while, at £3m, Bournemouth striker Matt Ritchie is a cheaper option.

They want to agree a fee for Enner Valencia of Pachuca and have asked Young Boys about Michael Frey. Targets include Esteban Cambiasso, Jonathan Soriano of Red Bull Salzburg and Stuttgart’s Antonio Rudiger.
