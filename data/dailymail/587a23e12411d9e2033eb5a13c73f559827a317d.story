These Siberian tigers nuzzled each other contentedly after a hearty lunch at a Chinese sanctuary.

The affectionate pair were spotted rubbing their scent against a tree trunk in the Siberian Tiger Park in Harbin, China as they chilled out in the snow this week.

They joined some of the park's 800 Siberian tigers, who live in Heilongjiang province in the world's largest breeding centre for the species.

The park in Harbin is the world's largest breeding centre for the Siberian tigers

Food brings out the creatures' competitive sides so no wonder they needed to relax after eating

Outside of captivity the breed, also known as Amur or Manchurian tigers, is mainly found in east Russia, north east China and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula

The calm of the resting animals came after a feeding frenzy as they vied to get to the front of the queue while a park keeper dropped meat joints into the enclosure.

One tiger was seen tearing into a pheasant it had bagged in the clamour for food.

The park is known for offering visitors a menu of live animals that they can pay for and watch being fed to the tigers.

Prices start at 50yuan (£5.30)for a domestic chicken and 100yuan (£10.50) for a duck or pheasant.

The park lets visitors pay for live animals, including chickens, sheep and cows, to be fed to the tigers while they watch

Visitors can send a sheep to its death for 600yuan (£63.50) or watch a cow being devoured for 2,000yuan (£211).

The Siberian tiger, also known as the Amur tiger, is the largest of the world's big cats.

Thanks to conservation efforts, including the Harbin park, it is the only breed of tiger whose numbers are not in decline.
