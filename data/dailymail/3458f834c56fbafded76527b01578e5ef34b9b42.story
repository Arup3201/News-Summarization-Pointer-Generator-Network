Women soldiers could be allowed into frontline combat roles, it was  announced yesterday.

Signalling the historic change, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it was time for the Armed Forces to abandon the ‘macho’ image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough.

He said the US, Canadian and Australian armies allowed women to serve in combat roles – and so should Britain.

But
 last night some former soldiers criticised the ‘politically correct’ 
announcement, saying it should not be considered a ‘right’ for women to 
fight on the front line.

One said the mixture of men and women could undermine the cohesiveness of units – putting lives at risk.

Women
 can find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy 
while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, 
logisticians or signallers.

However,
 they remain barred from all infantry battalions and Royal Marine 
Commando units – including Special Forces – and from tank regiments and 
other armoured units.

Theoretically,
 women would be allowed to join the Special Forces, such as the SAS. But
 to do so they would be expected to pass the unit’s gruelling mental and
 physical selection process.

‘There
 is no way we are going to make the tests easier,’ said a defence 
source. The ban has not stopped women being killed in Iraq and 
Afghanistan where they are at risk from roadside bombs even away from 
the frontline.

Eight women have been killed in combat in the conflicts – 2 per cent of the total fatalities.

Among
 the women who have been killed serving in Iraq is a friend of Prince 
William. Joanna Dyer, 24, a Second Lieutenant attached to 2nd Battalion 
The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, trained alongside Prince William at 
the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.

Mr
 Hammond said yesterday that he had brought forward a planned review – 
to be carried out by the Chief of the General Staff – of whether women 
should be able to join the infantry and the armoured corps.

It
 will coincide with what could be the first year that British troops 
have not been engaged in fighting somewhere in the world since at least 
1914 following the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

By
 January next year there will be fewer than 500 troops in the warzone, 
mainly in mentoring or advisory roles.

When UK forces pull down the 
Union Flag at Camp Bastion, it is likely to signal the end of a century 
or more of unbroken warfare for British forces. If the review backs 
women on the front line, the Army would be expected to make the 
necessary changes – such as reforms to living quarters – as soon as 
possible. No timescale for the first women on the frontline has yet been
 set.

Mr Hammond said: ‘At a
 time when the Americans, the Australians, the Canadians, even the 
French – the Israelis of course for years – have women in their combat 
arms, this is something we have to look at again.’ He acknowledged that 
the demands of frontline combat may mean that only a limited number may 
meet the rigorous fitness requirements for some posts.

‘I
 am looking for a way forward that signals the Army’s openness to all 
who can meet the standards required, maintaining combat effectiveness 
and militarily necessary standards of fitness,’ he said.

But Colonel Richard Kemp, who led British troops in Afghanistan, said: ‘The infantry is very different from any other job.

‘The
 essence of infantry soldiering is to close with the enemy and kill him 
face to face with bullets, bayonets and grenades. Facing and killing a 
large and aggressive male enemy soldier – if necessary in hand to hand 
combat – requires a certain ferocity, aggression and killer instinct 
that is more characteristic of men than women.

‘Fighting
 and killing an enemy in close combat is not a right nor an 
“opportunity” as the Defence Secretary suggests. It is a dreadful, 
gut-churning, traumatic and incredibly tough job that must be done to 
defend the country.

‘The 
politically correct view that men and women are the same and equally 
capable of every human activity is a dangerous notion when applied to 
close infantry combat.’

Major
 Judith Webb, who retired from the Army in 1986, opposes close combat 
roles for women. ‘We have to accept that we are different 
physiologically,’ she said. ‘We don’t have the same upper-body 
strength.’
