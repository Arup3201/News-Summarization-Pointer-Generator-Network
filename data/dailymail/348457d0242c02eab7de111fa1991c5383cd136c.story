Jobcentre staff are to be sent into schools under Tory plans to stop children as young as 14 from descending into a life on the dole.

Iain Duncan Smith warns that too many children who leave school at 16 ‘bump around’ doing cash-in-hand work for years before they are offered help, and are left with a 'wage scar' on their backs for the rest of their lives.

The Work and Pensions Secretary told MailOnline a future Tory government would send advisers into every school to help those 'most at risk' of falling out of the jobs market and ending up on benefits.

Ministers argue that teenagers who pass through school gaining few, if any, good qualifications are not ‘picked up’ by the welfare state until they sign on at a jobcentre aged 18.

Mr Duncan Smith warns that school leavers who are unemployed until they are 18 have ‘a wage scar on their back which blights their prospects for decades to come’.

Youngsters who spend the intervening years not in education, employment or training (NEET) cost the taxpayer an extra £56,000 over their working lifetime.

Under the Conservative plans, children would be given lessons in the need to find a job before they even start stuffing for their GCSEs.

New figures show there are 30,000 children aged 16 and 17 who are unemployed and not in full-time education.

Long-standing rules meant jobcentres were not allowed to help the unemployed until they turned 18.

Trials are now being run for 16 and 17-year-olds, but Mr Duncan Smith said he wants to go further and give work advice to children aged 14 and 15 to break the cycle of welfare dependency.

The get-tough plan would form a key part of David Cameron’s pledge to end youth unemployment.

Mr Duncan Smith said he has ‘long been concerned ‘about young people who leave school before they are 18, ‘unsure what they want to do next’ and ending up as NEETs.

He told MailOnline: ‘Restricting Jobcentre support until young people reach the age of 18 isn't good enough, because if you've got someone who leaves school at 16 they've got two years where they will bump around, maybe doing a bit of cash in hand work, probably not doing very much at all.

‘Then, when they arrive at the door of the jobcentre, they have a 'wage scar' on their back which blights their prospects for decades to come.

‘That's a personal tragedy for each of those young people, but also a tragedy in terms of wasted potential.

‘And it has an additional cost too – estimated to be around £56,000 to the public finances over the working lifetime of each person who has been NEET at this age.’

Jobcentre staff will be sent into schools to work with children as young as 14, to prevent them become benefits claimants of the future

The Tories plan to make the eradication of youth unemployment a key part of their 2015 election campaign.

Jobseekers Allowance would become a 'training allowance' for 18 to 21-year-olds.

They would be given six months to find a job or training to prepare them for work.

After that their dole would be scrapped unless they agreed to take part in 'community projects', such as cleaning up parks.

The savings would be used to fund the creation of 3million apprenticeships. 

Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘I have long argued that that we should be getting Jobcentre staff into schools to work with young people - to make sure that the transition from school to their next pursuit is a smooth and positive one.’

There are currently 34 trials where jobcentre work coaches are supporting 16 and 17 year olds to get the skills and experience they need to prepare for the world of work.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘This should dramatically change their prospects. It is about social mobility, as well as about ensuring we give young people the best chance to get on in life.

‘And a future Conservative Government would go even further - with every jobcentre providing an adviser with a strong local knowledge of the labour market, employers, schools, colleges, and work experience opportunities.

‘This adviser will engage with young people from the age of 14 or 15 - targeting those most at risk of falling out of education, employment or training - and will work with them to secure a better, brighter future.

‘This move will radically improve the hope and aspirations of a generation that the last Government left behind.’

New figures from the Office for National Statistics show there were 489,258 people aged 16-24 who were unemployed and not in full-time education, down 27 per cent in a year

Figures published yesterday showed that in the three months to September there were 489,258 people aged 16-24 who were unemployed and not in full-time education.

The figure has fallen by 182,000 or 27 per cent in a year. Among 16 and 17 year-olds, the figure fell by 14 per cent to 32,000.

It means around 14 per cent of 16-24-year-olds are not studying and not working.

Mr Duncan Smith said the figures stand 'in stark contrast to the rest of Europe, where many countries are seeing youth unemployment at levels as worryingly high as 50 per cent'.
