Crunch time: Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou is facing fears his government will default on its debt

Britain will not fund a second EU bail out of Greece, a Government official in Brussels said today.

The spokesman said any help for the Mediterranean country - which is on the verge of defaulting on its debt - should be funded by eurozone countries only.

That was the case when the EU stepped in to prop up the Athens regime with a £95billion loan last year, but the crippled Greek economy had raised fears that other countries could be asked to help avert financial disaster.

Experts warn any default by Greece could trigger a Lehman Brothers-style credit crisis.

Germany and France have already signalled there is no reason for London to pay a share of any repeat bail-out.

And in Brussels a UK Government official commented: 'The UK is of the view that the Greek problem is to do with the eurozone.

'The original problem was resolved with bilateral loans, put together for Greece last May and it is appropriate that only those involved in the original bail-out should be involved - the UK will not be involved.'

There was a 'theoretical risk', he said, that if a second bail-out package were agreed, some may want to use a bail-out fund set up after the Greek crisis last year, which involves contributions from all EU countries.

But he added: 'We do not get the benefits of the euro, as we are not members, so we should not be involved (in a bail-out).'

And ahead of talks between EU finance
 ministers Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I 
don't want to speculate on what might happen.

'There is no proposition on the table on this and we are not part of those arrangements, those bilateral arrangements.'

EU eurozone finance ministers are due to agree next week on the latest payment from the 110 billion euro (£96.5 billion) Greek bail-out approved in May last year.

And they are also under pressure to settle the terms of a second bail-out, following the failure of existing Greek austerity measures to revive the economy and close the Greek national deficit gap.

Chancellor George Osborne will be attending the talks in Luxembourg, but he will expect Germany and France to stick to their public acknowledgement that the issue does not involve the UK.

On the eve of the talks, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou today reshuffled his cabinet and tried to calm public opposition to further austerity measures which he must push through his Parliament as the price of any further bail-out involving the eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund.

The stumbling block is a clash between Germany and France, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that any repeat bail-out must involve private bondholders taking a share of the financial risk of propping up the Greek economy.

France, backed by the European Central Bank, says that would amount to a 'selective default' by Greece - with dire consequences for market speculation about the longer-term consequences for the credibility of the euro currency.

A senior official at the bank yesterday warned the bailout fund could soar to 1.5trillion euros, equal to more than £1.1trillion. 

This week the IMF approved an emergency £10billion payment to the Greek government to enable it to pay its bills next month.

The warning came as world stock markets hit a three-month low and the euro tumbled amid growing fears a Greek default could force other struggling economies to follow, and spark a fresh global economic crisis.

Neil Mackinnon, an economist at VTB Capital in London and a former Treasury official, said: ‘The probability of a Eurozone Lehman moment is increasing.

‘The markets have moved from simply pricing in a high probability of a Greek debt default to looking at a scenario of it becoming disorderly and of contagion spreading to other economies like Portugal, like Ireland, and maybe Spain, Italy and Belgium.’

European's economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn has warned there must be decisions at a meeting of EU finance ministers on July 11, if not earlier - and in the meantime Mr Papandreou, if he holds on to power, must deliver Greek Parliament agreement on further austerity measures.

This afternoon European Commission 
President Jose Manuel Barroso urged Greece to play its part in creating 
conditions for another bail-out:'I
 hope the new Greek government can be approved rapidly so that the 
process for continuation of financial assistance to Greece may continue 
smoothly.

'I look to 
eurozone ministers on Sunday to resolve remaining differences and come 
to a responsible agreement on financial assistance to Greece.

'Greece
 must also do its part. I am confident that leaders in Greece and in 
Europe will rise to the challenge and act with responsibility.'

Last night former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said it was ‘double or quits time’ for Greece and the euro.

Carswell said that Greece should be allowed to default on its debts 
after warnings the bailout could cost £1trillion

He said France and Germany would 
either have to bail out the struggling economy, or allow Greece to leave
 the single currency and risk its collapse.

Mr
 Redwood said the ‘simple and best’ solution would be for Greece and 
other struggling countries to quit the euro. But he said that whatever 
solution was agreed, British taxpayers’ money should not be involved.

Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell said defaulting was now the ‘least worst thing’ for Greece to do.

He
 said it would be ‘totally unacceptable’ for more British money to be 
used in a vain attempt to prop up Greece or other struggling Eurozone 
countries.

Mr Carswell 
said membership of the euro was limiting Greece’s options and likened 
its situation to the Black Wednesday debacle in which Britain was forced
 to quit Europe’s Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992.

The Greeks are revolting, the euro is tumbling and the talk is of economic meltdown across Europe - it's Groundhog Day all over again...

Why are we in another Greek crisis over the euro?

- Actually it's the same crisis, exacerbated by the failure of national austerity measures to revive the Greek economy. That is why the Greek prime minister is trying to form a new government, win a vote of confidence and get his people to tighten their belts even more.

Wasn't this sorted out when the European Union and the International Monetary Fund first agreed a bail-out package last year?

- In theory, but the economic cuts Greece introduced as a condition for getting the bail-out have failed to deliver the necessary deficit reduction and now Europe is facing the prospect of another bail-out.

But in return for another bail-out won't Greece have to agree even more belt-tightening?

Exactly, which is why Greeks are revolting over the threat of more tax hikes, pay cuts and job losses, and why the euro is weakening again under speculative pressure.

Is there any point throwing more money at the Greeks?

Sadly, yes: it's not just a question of bailing out the Greeks but limiting "contagion" to other eurozone countries and restoring market confidence in the single currency.

Isn't that what everyone said last time?

Yes, and it's even more urgent now, but this time there's a rumpus among EU nations about how to do it. Germany, backed by the Finns and Austria, and the International Monetary Fund, wants Greece's private creditors to share some of the burden by extending their credit lines to Greece. But others, led by France, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary say that would amount to a dreaded "default" by Greece, and hit the euro really hard.

Who is right?

It depends which economic model you favour as the way to restore the fortunes of the Greek economy and the euro more widely. No-one has the perfect solution, and nobody has got it right in this economic crisis so far.

What happens next?

A lot: the next slice of the original 110 billion euro (£96.5 billion) Greek bail-out is due to be agreed by eurozone countries on Sunday, with the IMF (which contributes a share) wanting to see what new longer-term plans the EU has for propping up Greece. Then a second bail-out package for the Greeks should be agreed at more talks on July 11.

And what about Greece?

The Greek government - whatever government and whoever leads it - must get another economic reform programme through parliament in the face of mounting public opposition, preferably by the end of this month.

It's a tall order isn't it?

It always was, and as much hangs on market perceptions about the state of the eurozone as the reality. The fact is that gossip about Greece falling out of the euro and returning to the drachma is not being ridiculed as much as it was a year ago.
