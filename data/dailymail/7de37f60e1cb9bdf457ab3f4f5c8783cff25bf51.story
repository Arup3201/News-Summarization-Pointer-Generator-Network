The Duchess of Cambridge had to take it sneezy yesterday as she turned out for Trooping The Colour.

She struggled to control a tickly nose as she arrived in her carriage for the ceremony.

And her sneezing fit continued as she took her place next to Prince William for the family line-up on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

Maybe she was suffering from  yesterday’s high pollen count.

The couple stood next to Prince Harry when they appeared at the end of the parade that marks the Queen’s official birthday.

The turnout of younger Royals included Lady Helen Taylor’s daughters Eloise, 11, and Estella, nine – but there was no sign of Prince George.

More than 1,000 soldiers marched in unison for the ceremony, which has been an annual event since 1760.

This year, the colour trooped was the flag of Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards.

In a thrilling finale, 28 military aircraft flew over The Mall as the Royal family watched from the balcony.

The Queen wore a powder blue hat with a cobalt blue rim. On her matching powder blue coat was a silver Brigade of Guards brooch.
