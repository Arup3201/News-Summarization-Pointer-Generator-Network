A father 'flipped out' while allegedly doing drugs with his 14-year-old daughter in hotel room.

Charles James was arrested on Monday after an employee at a Baytown, Texas, hotel heard screams for help coming from a room.

Police were called to Palace Inn Hotel and found James in the room with his teenage daughter.

Detectives said James, 36, appeared to be under the influence of drugs.

They reported he had glossy eyes and slurred speech. 

The girl told officers they had been doing drugs and her dad 'flipped out,' reports Khou.com.

When police attempted to question James he was not coherent and unable to answer their questions.

He has now been charged with child endangerment. 

The girl was turned over to relatives.
