Heroin overdoses are tragic, and unfortunately they aren't restricted to human beings.

Police in Boulder, Colorado believe a young man's cat may have been killed by inhaling the powerful drug, after a neighbour allegedly blew heroin smoke in its face.

As Fox31 Denver reports, Boulder police arrested Danielle Blankenship, 21, on Tuesday morning on charges of cruelty to animals stemming from the mysterious death of a cat named Muffin.

Charged: Danielle Blankenship, 21, of Boulder, Colorado is accused of blowing heroin smoke in a cat's face. The animal died shortly after the alleged incident

Ms Blankenship is also charged with third degree assault and domestic violence.

Police say they arrested the young woman after responding to a domestic violence call in the 1100 block of 30th Street Tuesday morning.

They say Ms Blankenship's boyfriend had called them to report that she hit him in the face.

Officers say the woman admitted punching her boyfriend because he wouldn't let her use his phone to
call for a ride.

At that point, the alleged incident took a bizarre turn, after a female officer reportedly noticed the cat lying on the steps of the apartment building.

Officer Gregory Perry wrote in a statement: 'The
cat appeared to be unresponsive, and the cat did not move when the 
officer touched it.

Bizarre: Muffin, the cat who died, had lived at the same apartment building in Boulder as Ms Blankenship

Ms Blankenship could face felony charges if a necropsy shows the cat was indeed poisoned by heroin

'It 
could not seem to get up'.

Fox31 identified the cat as an animal named Muffin, and which reportedly belonged to a neighbour man, 24, who asked not to be named because he didn't want to be associated with an event that allegedly involved drugs.

According to police, Ms Blankenship’s boyfriend told them she had been smoking heroin and blew it in the cat’s face.

Ms Blankenship denies smoking heroin and denies that she blew smoke in Muffin's face.

When police asked Ms Blankenship if the lethargic cat had been struck, she reportedly told them she would never hurt a cat.

The police called animal control, who took the pet to the Humane Society of Boulder Valley.

Owner: A 24-year-old man who lives at the complex was reportedly Muffin's owner. He asked not to be named

Boulder's finest: Colorado police noticed that Muffin wasn't doing well, and started asking questions

Boulder Police Spokeswoman Kim Kobel told Fox31: 'The vet clinic called the Poison 
Control Center to try to find out if there were some specific things 
they could do to revive the cat.

'They gave it some IVs, and the cat 
rallied at one point.

'They 
thought it was going to make it, but then it crashed soon after that and
it died about 6:30 last night.

'Our
animal control officers have seen poisoning before. They have responded
to cases where animals get into household cleaners, bleaches, and 
things like that.

'This is an unusual case, if it actually is indeed a 
drug poisoning like this, a heroin poisoning', Ms Kobel said.

A necropsy is scheduled to be performed on the cat, to try to determine if it was killed from heroin.

If that turns out to be the case, Ms Blankenship could face felony charges.

She is currently being held in the Boulder County Jail on $1,500 bond.
