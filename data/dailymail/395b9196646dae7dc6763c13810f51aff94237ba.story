The man accused of murdering five-year-old April Jones in a sexually motivated attack today told a jury he put her body 'somewhere where it has not been found'.

Mark Bridger, 47, claims he cannot remember what he did with the schoolgirl after she died because he was suffering from memory loss.

Elwen Evans QC, prosecuting, told Mold 
Crown Court that after April’s disappearance police mounted the biggest 
search in British history for her.

She said police had 'looked everywhere', and asked Bridger: 'Where did you put the body?'

Bridger replied: 'I can’t recall. I still believe I have placed her somewhere.'

The former slaughterhouse worker claims April died when she was accidentally hit by his car. He said he cannot recall what happened to her afterwards because of the combined effects of alcohol and panic.

Victim: April Jones, five, who Bridger claims died when she was accidentally hit by his car

Miss Evans said April's body has not been found because Bridger was trying to cover up what he had done.

She said: 'Why has April’s body, not any a part of it, been found?'

The defendant replied: 'I have put her somewhere where it hasn’t been found.'

Bridger denied putting the body somewhere 'carefully chosen'.

Miss Evans said: 'It’s just one of those things? That wherever you have put her was just a search site that the police never looked? Is that what you are saying?'

Bridger replied: 'You are asking me to speculate here and I can’t do that.'

He said he told police at the time about the places he had been and walked, including caves and rivers.

Miss Evans said police had been 'up hill and down dale, down mine shafts and not found her anywhere'.

Bridger told the jury he had a recollection of 'holding' April and placing her on the floor in front of the fireplace in his living room at his cottage, Mount Pleasant.

Asked about the presence of saws, hacksaws and knives in his living room, which the prosecutor described as 'weaponry', Bridger told the court they were 'tools' for outdoor activities.

'I love my bushcraft,' he said: 'They are tools I have used - saws for cutting wood, hacksaws for making knife handles and walking stick handles - all of which I do in my living room.'

Earlier, Miss Evans asked Bridger whether he had been 'sexually frustrated' on the day April disappeared. He said: 'No, not at all.'

She asked if he had looked at indecent images of children on his laptop that day.

The defendant replied: 'I can’t remember if I looked at it, I clicked on a picture.'

Questioned about the indecent images 
of children which were found on his laptop, Miss Evans asked the 
defendant: 'Are you a paedophile?'

'No', Bridger said.

The barrister continued: 'Why do you have indecent images of children on your computer?'

Bridger replied: 'A lot of them were 
for looking into the development of my son and daughter. Some I didn’t 
even know were there. Others I put aside to complain.'

Miss Evans said that was 'absolute nonsense' adding: 'You deliberately saved each and every one of those pictures.'

Questioned about a search for, 
'naked five-year-old girls', he said: 'That’s a mistake I made on that 
one, it should have been 15.

'This was all to do with my daughter’s development.

'It was a mis-type.'

Bridger told the court that he would be 'happy' to show one of the pornographic images found on his laptop to his son or daughter when they were 'learning' about sex.

Miss Evans said: 'So you would be happy to show your children that image?'

He replied: 'At the right time. If my son came to me and asked me about sexual things. How things work. That would be a picture I would not be frightened to show him.'

Bridger also described another one of the images, which showed a picture of young girl, aged 10 or 12, with a snake as 'beautiful'.

He said the picture was from a 'non-sexual nudism' site.

The court was shown a picture of a clothed six year old girl that was saved in Bridger’s ZO file, which the prosecution say he saved his pornography on.

Miss Evans asked why he had a picture of the child in that folder.

Bridger said: 'I don’t know why. This is not a sexy pose. She’s a friend of my daughter’s. She’s six years old.'

The defendant, of Ceinws, mid-Wales, denies abduction, murder and intending to pervert the course of justice by disposing of, concealing or destroying April’s body. The schoolgirl disappeared on October 1 last year.

The prosecution say the defendant snatched and murdered her in a sexually motivated attack.

Bridger says he accidentally killed 
April when he ran her over and accepts he must have got rid of her body,
but cannot remember how.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
