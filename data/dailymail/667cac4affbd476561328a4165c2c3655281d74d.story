General Motors CEO Dan Akerson has announced that he will step down next month and be replaced by the first woman to run the storied car company.

Mary Barra, a GM 'lifer' and the current global product chief, has been named as his successor in the landmark appointment.

The new title bump for the married mother-of-two means that she will be the first woman to head a global car manufacturer.

To insiders, her new role as CEO comes as part of a steady climb, as her father is a long-time GM employee and Barra has spent her entire 33-year career at the company.

When she starts her new job on January
15, she will lead a company that's made nearly $20billion since 
emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, much of it from the cars and trucks 
she helped develop.

She 
still faces challenges of paring down GM's costs and winning over buyers
in international markets such as India and South America.

Akerson, 65, said he had planned to stay at least until spring, but his wife's advanced cancer diagnosis changed that.

He
said the board unanimously picked Barra from several internal 
candidates because of the breadth of her experience, her management 
record, her people skills and her understanding of GM's operations.

‘This is an executive who has a vision of where she wants to take the organization,’ he said.

Since
February 2011, Barra has held what many say is the most important job 
at GM. She joined the company in 1980 as an engineering student at 
Kettering - then known as General Motors Institute - and became a plant 
manager, executive director of engineering and head of human resources.

Along
the way, she earned a reputation as a manager who made tough decisions,
yet was able to get people to follow her lead and work as a team, 
according to current and former GM executives.

Noting her talent, GM sent her to Stanford University to get an MBA.

The
51-year-old executive has been in charge of design, engineering and 
quality for all GM vehicles and has shepherded most of the company's 
recent new vehicle introductions.

Under
her command, GM rolled out brawny new full-size pickup trucks, the 
Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, and the Chevrolet Impala full-size 
car, which earned the highest score for a sedan in testing by Consumer 
Reports magazine.

Akerson 
hinted at Barra's promotion earlier this year when he told a women's 
business group in Detroit that a ‘car gal’ would someday run one of the 
Detroit Three automakers but he made it clear Tuesday that she wasn't 
picked because she's a woman.

‘Mary's one of the most gifted executives I've met in my career,’ he said.

During
her tenure, GM's quality scores rose in surveys done by J.D. Power and 
Associates. She also streamlined the organization, eliminating positions
and putting one engineer in charge of each vehicle.

'She
is polished, soft-spoken, invariably polite, but firm and goal-focused.
She will have a learning curve, but will be an excellent CEO,' said Bob
Lutz, a retired GM vice chairman who once led product development.

Barra grew up near Pontiac, Michigan, in a car-oriented family. Her father was a die maker who retired from GM after 39 years.

GM's
previous two CEOs, Akerson and Whitacre, came from outside the auto 
industry and lacked the experience that Barra has, said Erik Gordon, a 
professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

'There's
nobody with more years of honest `car-guy' credentials than she has,' 
Gordon said. 'She's the one to do the breakthrough.'
