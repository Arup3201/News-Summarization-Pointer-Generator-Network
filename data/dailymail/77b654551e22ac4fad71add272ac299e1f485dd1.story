A 24-year-old man allegedly owed $3,000 to a married father-of-two he is suspected of killing in a drug dispute gone bad and told police the father threatened him and his family during a pool game.

Fireman and ex-Marine Iraq veteran Jerry Perdomo, 31, of Orange City, Florida, had driven 1,500 miles to see a friend and was last seen at a house in Jackson, Maine, last month on February 16.

But a police probe began three days ago after a woman described as Mr Perdomo's girlfriend told Maine police that she last saw him with a handgun, going to 'meet someone who owed him money'.

Body found: Jerry Perdomo, 31, left of Orange City, Florida, was last seen at a rural home in Jackson, Maine, on February 16. Daniel Porter, 24, right, was charged with the murder and faces a court appearance on Thursday

Now Daniel Porter, 24, the man whom 
police say Mr Perdomo was meeting, will make his first court appearance 
on Thursday in Waldo County Superior Court in Belfast, Maine, to face a 
murder charge.

He allegedly told police Mr Perdomo 
was dead but would not say where his body was - before Maine cops found 
it after a search with police dogs in woods owned by Porter's relatives 
in rural Newburgh.

Police told Fox News they found blood samples 
likely matching Mr Perdomo's DNA and what appears to be skull or bone pieces at a home where Porter was living in 
the nearby small town of Jackson.

Porter and Mr Perdomo were involved in
drugs and had exchanged death threats in January, police said. Porter 
told police that a man he believed was Mr Perdomo had thrown rocks at 
his house.

‘Perdomo stated that he observed 
Porter with a machine gun and that Porter threatened to shoot him and 
put him through a wood chipper,’ according to an affidavit. ‘Porter 
stated that Perdomo threatened to cut off his hands and kill him.’

Porter allegedly drove Mr Perdomo's 
rented car to a Wal-Mart store in Bangor, Maine, abandoned it, and threw a bag
with his wallet, mobile phones and keys into a rubbish bin behind
a supermarket.

Records also show Porter and his 
25-year-old girlfriend, Cheyanne Nowak, had purchased a handgun at a 
pawn shop on January 20.

‘This is a sad and extremely difficult
time for the family and his co-workers,’ Seminole County Fire Chief 
Leeanna Mims said, adding that the Florida department’s prayers were 
with the Perdomos.

Asked if state police had contacted 
drug-investigation agencies, Maine Lieutenant Christopher Coleman said, 
‘The investigation is very active and this is one of the pieces we are 
looking at.’

Earlier this week, speaking from her 
home in Orange City, Mr Perdomo's wife, Tonya, described the father of a
three-year-old and ten-year-old as ‘a dedicated dad’. ‘He helps people 
out a lot,’ she said.

‘I love him. He is my only love, he is
my only love,’ Mrs Perdomo said on Monday, reported Fox News. ‘I just 
want to talk to him. I just feel like I need to talk to him. I do.’

Mr Perdomo had left Florida in a 
rental car and told his wife he was going to see friends in Maine, which
she said was not unusual because the former serviceman had friends from
all over.

Investigators positively identified 
the body but did not say how he died and planned an autopsy for Friday. 
Christopher MacLean, Porter's attorney, did not immediately comment on 
Wednesday.
