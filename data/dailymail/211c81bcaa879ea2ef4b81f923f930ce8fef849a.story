The Liberal Democrats snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat yesterday after their most torrid week since coming to power.

But Nick Clegg had to rely on Labour voters to do it after polling suggested he had benefited from tactical switching to try to stop the Tories winning.

He hailed it a ‘stunning victory’, although the Lib Dems saw their majority cut in half.

It came as the seat’s disgraced former MP Chris Huhne faces jail, former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard is accused of molesting women and the party’s poll ratings nationally are their at lowest in years.

Scraped through: Mike Thornton, pictured with his wife Peta Thornton at the Eastleigh by-election count, won his seat by just 1,771 votes

But analysis of the Eastleigh poll showed Lib Dems relied heavily on a lacklustre campaign by Labour.

Twenty-three per cent of those who voted Labour at the last general election – around 1,800 voters – instead backed the Lib Dems, according to exit polling by Lord Ashcroft.

Tactical voting was not encouraged by Labour, unlike in 2010 when senior figures hinted that people in marginal southern seats should vote Lib Dem where Labour had little chance

But the Lib Dem candidate, tax specialist Mike Thornton, clearly found Labour voters’ support crucial as he scraped through only 1,771 votes ahead of UKIP.

All smiles: UKIP leader Nigel Farage emerged as one of the big winners of the night, claiming the result had 'stunned the establishment'

Lib Dem president Tim Farron admitted that defeat by any margin would have been an ‘unspeakable catastrophe’ and would have fuelled critics who said the party was ‘going down the plughole’.

He took the opportunity to attack claims that Lord Rennard made unwanted advances to a number of female activists as a ploy by the Press to derail the party’s chances.

Mr Clegg said it showed his party was still able to win elections, even in ‘exceptionally difficult circumstances’. Mr Thornton said he was ‘absolutely exuberant’.

Mr Farron said that up to 30 Tory seats were now vulnerable in the 2015 General Election.

Gloomy faces: David Cameron admitted the defeat of Tory candidate Maria Hutchings, pictured at an event during the campaign, was 'disappointing'

Against the odds: Mr Thornton's triumph came despite the resignation of ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who faces jail for perverting the course of justice, and the Lib Dems being caught up in sexual harassment claims against Lord Rennard
