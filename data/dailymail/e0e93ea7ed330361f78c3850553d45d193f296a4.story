It is meant to be the happiest day of your life.

So Alex Pelling, 32, and Lisa Grant, 30, must be having an extremely happy year.

The East Yorkshire couple have been travelling the world since last summer and celebrating their love for each other by having 22 wedding ceremonies in different countries - and they still have eight to go.

What's more, the pair say they are now more in love than ever.

So far they have been hitched among dolphins in Hawaii, dressed as vampires in LA, on an island in Honduras, in a crayfish-riddled lake in Michigan, in a vineyard in Quebec, on the beach in Mexico, on horseback in Banff and in 15 other locations around Central, South and North America.

Speaking to MailOnline, the 
couple - who have known each other for 11 years and been dating for six - said: 'The idea came as we looked for a place to get married 
before we left our lives behind to travel around the world for two 
years.

'The wedding 
opportunities offered to us in the UK did not suit what we wanted, so we
decided to look for the perfect place to wed while we travelled.

'After
a glass of wine or two the idea grew, and we made a decision to have a 
small ceremony in every country we visited, with the local cultures and 
traditions in mind.

'At the
end of our trip (which we have just extended to three years) we will 
choose our favourite place to officially "tie the knot"!'

Ever since their first wedding in Manchester (which Alex organised as a surprise for Lisa), the couple have kept 
an online blog about the travels, and professional photographers have 
helped document the trip. Anyone who wishes to attend one of their ceremonies can request an invitation on their blog.

To fund the trip Alex and Lisa and sold both the car repair shop Alex owned and their home. Sticking to a strict weekly budget they have been travelling and living in their 25-year-old Dodge campervan, called Peggy, which has cut out any costs for accommodation.

Alex said: 'The budget is very tight but we are
managing. Our biggest cost is 
fuel, obviously, and we do a weekly shop at local markets to reducing our living 
costs.

'And of course we could not even begin to afford to throw a wedding
every other week if it was not for the generosity of the photographers,
suppliers, families and people we meet on our journey.

'Everyone helps 
us for free or a minimal cost as they want to help us spread the love 
and to be a part of our adventure!'

When asked about any problems they 
have encountered along the way, the couple say making repairs to Peggy 
has been the biggest hurdle.

'Making repairs to Peggy has been our biggest hurdle,' they said. 'We bought her in Canada and have
covered over 55,000km so far. We have only had minimal problems but 
they have been difficult to solve with the language barriers!

'With regards to the wedding side of the journey, everyone has been so 
accommodating and we have had very few obstacles, only once were we 
turned away for a ceremony for not having commited to the same religious
beliefs as the local church.

'And even then the church invited us to 
attend mass and dedicated that evenings prayers to us and our travels 
and commitments to each other.'

The couple say their Peru wedding was
'the most emotional, touching and stunningly beautiful; and therefore 
probably their favourite, and that one of the trickiest to organise was 
in Belize, where they wanted to 
hold a ceremony in the 
Toledo district with help from local Mayan people, but where a week-long
torrential downpour and a photographer stuck 600km away hampered 
proceedings.

'We were about ready to give up when the 
sun came out just in time for the wedding! It was a beautiful day and we
learned such an important lesson about the things we take for granted!'

Luckily, the couple say the only unpleasant wedding guests they have had have been 'a
thousand banana spiders in Honduras on the island of Utila, and maybe a 
couple of smelly drunk fishermen in Chile'.

Even more luckily, they say they are still as much in love as they were when their adventure began.

'And
probably more so! We are together 24 hours a day, seven days a week and
live in a van. We arrange weddings, share the driving, split the blog 
workload and take it turns to make each other breakfast in bed every 
day.

'If there is anything 
that makes you know you are meant to be together it is surviving this 
trip without a single argument. We still get nervous before every single
ceremony!'

Alex and Lisa are running a competition with Zankyou and Unicef to fly two people out to their final destination wedding.
