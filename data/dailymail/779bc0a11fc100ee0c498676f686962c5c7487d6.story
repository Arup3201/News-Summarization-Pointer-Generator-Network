Pushing a pram carrying her new baby, Louise Woodward looks like she is getting used to her new role as a mother.

Sixteen years after she was convicted as a nanny of killing the little boy in her care, she was seen walking with her mother and daughter Holly.

Woodward, now 35, is said to have been 'delighted' at the prospect of motherhood with her businessman husband, Anthony Elkes.

She gave birth to their daughter at the turn of the New Year, and last week was seen sharing parenting duties with her mother Sue, near the young family's home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.

The grown-ups took turns to push the baby and walk the pet dog and also stopped to look in a toy shop in the high street.

The new mother was said to have been keen to start a family more than 16 years after she was convicted of shaking eight-month-old Matthew Eappen to death in Boston, Massachusetts.

At the time she was 19 and working for the Eappen family as a nanny on her gap year.

She was jailed for 15 years in 1997 after being found guilty of second degree murder.

But her conviction was later reduced to involuntary manslaughter on appeal and she served 279 days.

Woodward, originally from Wirral, Merseyside, has always maintained her innocence and her claims were backed by experts.

She kept quiet about her pregnancy but has previously spoken about people's reaction to any news she might be expecting.

She previously told the Daily Mail: 'I know there are some people waiting for me to have a baby so they can say nasty things.

'It upsets me but that is not going to stop me leading my life.

'I am innocent. I have done nothing wrong.

'I
 am entitled to enjoy my life. I am not going to apologise for being 
happy.' She married Mr Elkes in May last year at a church where she 
teaches jive and salsa classes to pensioners.

Now
 known as Mrs Elkes, she also stages occasional cake-making workshops, 
although the events are more of a hobby than a business.

After news of her pregnancy emerged, Matthew's aunt Mary Wong, 52, said the law graduate had a 'right to have a child', but suggested she take parenting classes and learn to control her temper.

She said: 'For the sake of her family I hope her parenting skills have come a long way.

'I think that she needs to have parenting skills and support for her baby.

'I hope no harm comes to the child.'
