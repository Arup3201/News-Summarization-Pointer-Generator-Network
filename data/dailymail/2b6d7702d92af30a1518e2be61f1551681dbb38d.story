The tragic deaths of a married couple hit by a freight train is now being treated as a murder-suicide with police telling MailOnline they believe the husband held his ill wife as the train sped towards them.

Earl and Mary Myatt – who had recently suffered a brain aneurism – were killed after walking onto the tracks together in upstate New York on Sunday.

It was initially thought it was a double suicide, but police now believe Mary Myatt’s condition meant she did not know what was going on and the whole event was planned by her husband.

Died together: Earl and Mary Myatt, both 59, had been married for 42 years. Police said they are now investigating the deaths as murder-suicide as it is believed that Mary was too disabled to make a decision to end her life

Mr Myatt, 59, had been struggling to cope with the stress of looking after his disabled wife, 59, who had apparently been ‘functioning like a toddler’ since the aneurism in January.

He left a suicide note in his car and called his heartbroken son, Brad, two minutes before the impact of the speeding train, telling him he loved him and he and he was sorry.

Devastated school teacher Brad said: ‘He called me at 1:35, and at 1:37, they were dead.'

Witnesses say they saw Mr Myatt driving up and down the road at the scene of the accident – in Verona, NY - up to 30 times before he parked his car and walked in front of the train with his wife.

State Trooper Jack Keller, told MailOnline: ‘We are still trying to piece everything together from that day, but it appears Mr Myatt brought his ill wife to that area and that it was a pre-planned event.

‘He had left a suicide note in the vehicle and contacted his son on the phone basically saying I am sorry for what I am about to do.

‘We are not sure if his wife knew about this, that is something we are trying to work out with the doctors, because we don’t know what her mental capacity was at the time, but it appears to be a murder-suicide.

‘It seems he had this planned, he waited for the train, he held onto her and as the train comes, they both get struck and killed by the train.

End scene: State police troopers said surveillance footage shows that Mr Myatt ignored a warning horn and looked to be purposefully waiting until the exact time that the train was approaching to get on the tracks

‘It is still something we are trying to determine, but at this point it certainly appears that she may not have known that this was the plan that day and that he might have planned to do this for whatever reason.

‘I am trying to be as discreet and respectful to the family as possible, but at the same time, the facts apparently show that this was more-or-less his plan. This is based on security footage and witnesses.

‘We interviewed the conductor and it seems that everything he told us was factual and true. The family have been notified of our findings, they are handling a tragedy of losing both parents.’

He added: ‘It appears from witnesses who live near the tracks that they had been driving around the area for some time, and it appeared to them that they had been waiting for the train to arrive.

‘At this point, there is obviously no one to prosecute, so the case would be closed and the family would be notified. I think that may happen this week. We try to wrap things up as quickly as possible for the family’s sake’.

Mr Keller said that it is not clear why Mr Myatt chose that particular point in the train's path, as Verona is about six miles away from their hometown of Oneida.

But it is clear that the stress of his wife’s deteriorating health was weighing down heavily on his shoulders since she was diagnosed with the brain aneurysm in late January.

She spent a month in intensive care and underwent several surgeries, the most recent only two weeks ago.

Her two sons, Brad and Brain, and husband visited her constantly but struggled to see her in pain as her motor functions and abilities were reduced to that of a toddler.

Brad explained to Syracuse.com that his mother wasn't the person she had been before the aneurysm, saying she would start a conversation and get lost, that she didn't always understand what was happening around her and she struggled to use the bathroom on her own.

Even in her final moments, when Mr Myatt put his wife on the phone with Brad, he said 'I'll see you soon' and he was unable to understand her response, which he said was common after the diagnosis.

Then Mr Myatt got on the phone. ‘He just said he loved me and he was sorry,’ Brad said. Brad knew something was wrong and begged his father to tell him where he was, but he hung up.

He also told the Syracuse.com that his father had become depressed as a result of his wife’s condition.

'He was saddened by what she had been reduced to... He missed his wife…. she was his world’, Brad, 30, added.

'We’re devastated... but I want everyone to know that my father was a good man, and my mother was an angel who would do anything for anybody.'

The couple – who had four grandchildren - met when they were 17-years-old and had been married for 42 years at the time of their death.

Mr Myatt rearranged his work schedule at the Mohawk Valley Community College bookstore so that he started at 3.30am and was able to finish earlier in the afternoon in order to spend more time with his ailing wife.

Mrs Myatt was apparently the perfect grandmother, loving nothing more than having tea parties or playing in the snow with her beloved grandchildren. Brad told Syracuse.com, ‘It was never about her.’

'We were spoiled in receiving two fantastic parents.’
