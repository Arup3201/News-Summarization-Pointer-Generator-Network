Luis Suarez is poised to start against England in Thursday's 'do or die' clash with Uruguay.

The Liverpool striker sat out Uruguay's opening game against Costa Rica to protect his knee and cut a frustrating figure on the bench as he watched them go down to a shock 3-1 defeat.

However, Uruguay's medical staff have convinced coach Oscar Tabarez that the 27-year-old talisman is not only fit to play but can start against England in the game that could decide both nations' World Cup fate.

On the mend: Luis Suarez (C) trains with his Uruguay teammates after recovering from knee surgery

Suarez underwent keyhole surgery on his knee last month but, speaking at the Uruguay training camp in Sete Lagoas, near Belo Horizonte, told Uruguay publication Ovación Digital: 'I have been training for a few days with the team and I am 100percent ready, I now only need time on the pitch and to play the game.

His Uruguay teammates have already been lifted by the news and senior players have been talking about a new buzz in the camp ahead of Thursday's game.

Suarez warned though: 'There is not one player that is going to be the saviour. We all have to work together to carry on.'

He also thanked Liverpool for not interfering and allowing Uruguay to take care of his recovery.

He added: 'There was never a moment when Liverpool said to me ''don't play''. The club have complete trust in Uruguay's team.

'I know all the English national-team players, both because they are team-mates or because they are rivals. They have defensive woes that we can take advantage of, but I won't tell the press how we have to play.'
