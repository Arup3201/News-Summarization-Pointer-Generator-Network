The UK's first-ever city centre zip wire has opened in Liverpool, whisking riders at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.

Flying 115 feet above shoppers and tourists below, the exhilarating ride last for one minute, depositing thrill-seekers safely at the end.

But for radio presenter, Leanne Campbell, the ride lasted just a little bit longer than planned.

Radio City,  a sponsor of the Liverpool Wire, sent one of their Breakfast Show hosts, Leanne, up to try it out - with some unforeseen results.

Leanne's ride started all well and good, but about 40 seconds in, she unexpectedly halted - dangling high above the pavement.

'Am I stuck?' she asks once she realises the zipline has stopped short of the end platform.

The zip wire ride started innocently enough with Leanne breezily whizzing along above Liverpool's centre

Thankfully, a ride operator came to get her a few minutes later.

The Liverpool Wire opened on August 9 and will offer rides through September 6.

Individuals can also sign up for Radio City's Cash for Kids to raise money for disadvantaged children.
