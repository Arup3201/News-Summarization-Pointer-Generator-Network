Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne appeared in a Perth Court on Friday on accusation of gaining passage on a flight under false identification.

The self-proclaimed sheik made a brief appearance in Perth Magistrates Court with two of his associates, Mostafa Shiddiquzzaman and Omer Abdirahman Issak, accused using fake identities to board domestic flights.

Thorne's bail terms include a personal undertaking, surrendering his passport, not applying for a new passport and staying at least 200m from international departure points.

The court heard Thorne, 25, had lost his old passport and it had been cancelled by authorities.  

Shiddiquzzaman and Issak each had their existing bail terms renewed with similar conditions, and were not required to enter pleas.

The trio, who had several supporters in the Perth court, are due back in court on April 24, but Thorne and Shiddiquzzaman will not have to appear in person because they are based in NSW.  

The court appearance follows a raid on Thorne's home in Bass Hill,  south-west of Sydney, in January, where the 25-year-old was subsequently informed of the court notice. 

The fundamentalist preacher first attracted the attention of authorities when he was deported in 2013 from Saudi Arabia, where he had lived for over a decade, after being detained for protesting his brother's imprisonment on terror-related charges. 

He has garnered a following on Facebook and Twitter, and is often outspoken on social media, posting online support for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris and defending slain Melbourne teenage terrorism suspect Numan Haider. 

Thorne sparked outrage in January when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' and were likely to 'simulate some kind of response' following the terror attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

His comments came just hours after 12 people were killed in the Paris massacre.

Thorne said staff at Charlie Hebdo had 'forbade to learn the lesson' of a firebombing in 2011, which took place a day after a caricature of the Prophet was published.  

'Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion,' Thorne tweeted.

'If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise "freedom of action".'  

Since flying from Sydney to Perth this week, the controversial Islamic preacher has tweeted about looking forward to seeing his mother and also detailed in several posts a run-in he had with police at a shopping centre. 

Authorities are cracking down on Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne after they ordered him to face charges in court following a suspected terror-related raid in Sydney in January

Thorne claimed on Thursday night that he was walking with a friend when they were approached by two officers who said hello to him and asked for his friend's name. 

He said the police kept pressuring his friend until he stepped in and explained that they were 'shopping like normal citizens'.

Thorne added that police warned him they would be watching him, despite claims that he had not been acting in a suspicious way. 

'We were being polite to the police while they were obviously harassing and trying to provoke us,' he wrote.

'I wonder if we're allowed to shop like normal Australian citizens without being harassed by police who use foul language for no reason?'

Thorne said he filmed some of the exchange on his phone but has not released the footage.    

'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' Thorne said in January said.   

Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them (on) certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.'

Over the past 12 months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. 

Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. 

After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. 

Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country.

Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. 

He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them (Islamic State), I would get in trouble,' he said.

'If I was to say that (I) don't support them at all, that would be untrue.

'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.
