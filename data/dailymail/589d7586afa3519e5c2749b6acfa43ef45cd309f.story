Labour of love: These stunning photos act as postcards for one photographer, who has traveled all over the globe, braving freezing temperatures to create the ultimate time-lapse video. Pictured: The Grand Canyon

Dedication: Photographer Dustin Farrell, 36, spent four years perfecting his technique and travelling all over the world in his quest to capture beautiful time lapses of nature. Pictured: A waterfall in Iceland

Creation: The dramatic photo shoots would take anywhere from 30 minutes through to a painstaking six hours. Pictured: Sand dunes

Dustin, who lives in Arizona, USA, merged almost a million pictures together to create the incredible timelapse video of scenes such as a lightning storm over the Grand Canyon and an explosive display of the Northern Lights in Iceland.

Dustin said: 'I was first attracted to time lapse photography because of the ability it gave me to create something that cannot be created with any normal video or film camera.

'The hardest part of time lapse is having the patience to get the footage. Finding a great location and setting up the right shot can also be very challenging.

Process: Time-lapse photography is a technique where photos are taken individually and then compiled together in a sequence, when played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and lapsing. Pictured: Horse shoe bend in Utah

Travel: 'I still have a few more places to travel to, I would love to visit New Zealand and I think a shoot in Las Vegas would show my versatility as a photographer,' said Mr Farrell

'My favourite shot was inside the cave with the Indian ruin in the foreground. Everything came together perfectly for that shot, which took a lot of planning and preparation that was followed by a long hike and difficult setup.

'I thought that we were going to get rained out by an incoming Summer storm. Instead, after an amazing one hour lightening show the storm cleared to reveal the Milky Way'.

Dustin has been a professional photographer for 14 years and currently runs his own production company in the USA.

Impressive: He manages to capture scenes which would otherwise be lost in normal photography. Pictured: The aurora in Iceland over ice

Creative: The photographer is so dedicated to his craft that he spends hours picking the right spot to set up his camera. Pictured: Cat rock and Oak creek

Remote: Time-lapse is an extreme version of the cinematography technique of undercranking, and sometimes time lapse photography can be confused with stop motion animation. Pictured: A weather station and the milky way
