Nottingham Forest are poised to announce a sponsorship deal with the Kuwaiti government which will see the name of the famous City Ground change to the Kuwait City Ground stadium.

Sportsmail understands Forest owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi has agreed the deal to rename to stadium the KCG Stadium.

And Stuart Pearce's players will also sport a Kuwait logo on their shirts this season as part of the agreement.

New name: Nottingham Forest's famous ground will take on the name of its new Kuwait sponsors

Fans backing: Kuwaiti Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi has agreed the deal, and his work at the club so far has been getting backing from fans last season

The 30,576 capacity ground, which has played host to Forest for 116 years, will be rebranded to fit its new name, as the Championship club's owners target promotion to the Premier League.

They finished 11th in the second tier last season but Al Hasawi has big ambitions to bring Forest back to the summit of English football - with this new deal the first step towards it.

Home soil: It isn't a huge name switch for Forest's famous home - and they will also have new kit sponsors

Psycho: Stuart Pearce begins his first full season as Forest boss and has the backing of the club's owners
