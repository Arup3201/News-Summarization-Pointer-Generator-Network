Following the news that an Australian aircraft was fired at delivering aid packages in northern Iraq last week, a Royal Australian Airforce plane has successfully handed a delivery of weapons to Kurdish forces in the region.

In a bid to arm residents against the advances of Islamic State militants, Defence said the latest operation was completed without incident before the plane returned to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. 

'The aircraft's crew has confirmed that no shots were fired at the aircraft and that their mission was carried out without incident,' Defence said in a statement early on Wednesday.

The C-17A Globemaster aircraft flew to Tirana in Albania over the weekend where it was loaded before delivering the ammunition to the Kurdish town of Erbil via Baghdad.

After an Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft was shot at by IS militants last week, an RAAF plane has successfully delivered supplies to Kurds in northern Iraq

Chief of Joint Operations, Vice Admiral David Johnston said further aid, stores and support flights may be planned to assist the people of northern Iraq, who remain under threat from extremist Islamic State fighters.

'The aircrew and support staff at Joint Task Force 633 have done a great job to successfully coordinate this mission to assist the people of northern Iraq,' he said.

'The cargo, in this case ammunition, was first inspected and cleared by Iraqi officials onboard the aircraft in Baghdad before the aircraft landed in Erbil.

Prime Minister Tony Abbot, seen here during a press conference on Sunday, warned of the risk involved in the operation

RAAF C130 Hercules aircraft have already made some aid drops to communities in northern Iraq as part of a US-led effort to fend off the IS militants, and on Tuesday received the support of UN chief Ban Ki-moon.

He said it was important that nations such as Australia help address the situation in Iraq.

'Without addressing this issue through certain means, including some military and counter-terrorist actions, we will just end up allowing these terrorist activities to continue,' he said speaking in Auckland.

Meantime, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned of further risks involved in the Iraq mission. 

Opposition leader Bill Shorten, seen here speaking at Parliament House last week, has reinstated his support for the airdrops

'Obviously, flying humanitarian air drops into combat zones are full of risk. But the risks are reasonable given the importance of the missions they're flying,' he said on Tuesday.

Labor leader Bill Shorten restated his support for the airdrops and weapons airlift but acknowledged there were easy options there.

'Providing the Kurds with light weapons, the opportunity to defend themselves against people who would kill their families, to me is the only logical choice here,' Mr Shorten said.
