Telling results: David Cameron is running a 'Government of chums' where 'who you know' matters more than 'what you know'

David Cameron is running a ‘Government of chums’ where ‘who you know’ matters more than ‘what you know’ – and he is becoming  dangerously out of touch with voters as a result.

That is the finding of a new poll in the wake of the longest run  of political and public-relations blunders by the Tories, many self-inflicted, since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister.

The hostile reaction to the ‘granny tax,’ the ‘pasty tax,’ the petrol panic and the Downing Street ‘donorgate’ scandal appears to have led to a growing feeling that Mr Cameron and his Ministers are elitist and remote.

The phrase ‘a Government of chums’ was first coined in a leader column in The Mail on Sunday last week, which asserted that ‘a small group of people from very similar backgrounds, who have known each other for years, are running the country mainly by talking to each other – and to nobody else’.

The idea was then taken up by former Tory Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit in The Times the following day.

Now, a poll by Survation for The Mail on Sunday provides convincing evidence that the public concurs.

More than six out of ten say Mr Cameron heads a ‘Government of chums’ – fewer than one in seven disagree.

Nearly two out of three say entry to Mr Cameron’s elite inner circle depends on ‘who you know’ against just one in five who say ‘what you know’ matters more.

Perhaps the most damning verdict came when voters were shown two photographs of Mr Cameron – one in his Oxford University Bullingdon Club days and a more recent one showing him dressed in jeans drinking a pint of beer in a pub – and then asked to identify the ‘real David Cameron’.

The Bullingdon Club emerged as the ‘real Cameron’ by a margin of 63 per cent to 37 per cent.

Nearly three-quarters of the population view the Conservatives as ‘out of touch’ and 61 per cent say the Tory leader is ‘more style than substance’.

The rest of the Cabinet fares little better when it comes to sharing the pain of the recession.

Nearly seven out of ten say that Ministers are not personally committed to their ‘we’re all in it together’ slogan.

Competiton: Three out of ten pin the same ‘snob’ label on George Osborne, left.  Yet the ratings of the Prime Minister’s fellow Old Etonian Boris Johnson, right, show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular

Four out of ten say Mr Cameron is a ‘snob’ and he polled a lowly average of 13 per cent for being ‘in touch’, ‘caring’, charismatic’, ‘sincere’ and ‘trustworthy’, while nearly one in four said he was ‘competent’.

Three out of ten pin the same ‘snob’ label on George Osborne. A dismal one in 25 say the Chancellor is ‘caring’.

Yet the ratings of  the Prime Minister’s fellow Old Etonian Boris Johnson show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular.

When asked who they would invite to dinner, the public put Mr Johnson way ahead with 22 per cent, followed by Mr Cameron on eight per cent.

Unpopular: Only one in ten regard state school-educated Ed Miliband, left, as a snob, yet a mere five per cent would want to sit next to him at dinner, making him a less popular guest than ex-Labour MP George Galloway, right

Only one in ten regard state school-educated Ed Miliband as a snob, yet a mere five per cent would want to sit next to him at dinner, making him a less popular guest than ex-Labour MP George Galloway.

Similarly, London Mayor Mr Johnson is seen as ‘most in touch’ by 14 per cent, followed by Mr Miliband on ten, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on nine and Mr Cameron on eight.

But the poll shows the Budget backlash is fading, with Labour’s lead down to five points from its eight-point margin two weeks ago. Labour now stands at 35 and the Tories 30.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s woes grow as anti-EU party UKIP has caught up with his Lib Dems on 11 per cent.

Mr Cameron will be relieved that despite the Budget backlash, he still beats Mr Miliband on economic trust by 34 per cent to 26. And Mr Miliband’s lack of flair remains a fatal flaw: only one in 33 say he has charisma, against 17 per cent for Mr Cameron.

Mr Osborne has edged back in front of Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on economic trust.

However, Mr Balls’ ‘man of the people’ image appears to have helped him achieve a notable victory when voters  were asked who would get the best bargain at a car boot sale.

More than one in four chose Mr Balls, with 13 per cent for Mr Osborne; Ed Miliband nine; Mr Cameron eight and Mr Clegg seven.

Survation interviewed 1,039 people online on Thursday  and Friday.
