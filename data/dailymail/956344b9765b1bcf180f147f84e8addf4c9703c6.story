The trend for celebrity-loved vitamin IV drips is being blamed for a critical shortage of medical supplies.

Many private clinics offering the trendy treatment use the same manufacturer of IV ingredients as hospitals, and now it is struggling to keep up with demand, the Washingtonian reports.

As a result, with no centralized database to direct the nutrients to people who need them most, the health system is said to be in jeopardy.

Not enough to go around: The health craze for receiving 'beautifying' vitamins via intravenous drip is being blamed for a critical shortage of medical supplies

Clinical pharmacist, Steve Plogsted said premature infants will be most affected as they need vitamin supplements to keep them alive and healthy.

'It's appalling that we are sacrificing the health of our babies for beauty, energy, and hangover relief,'  he said.

Hollywood stars, models, athletes and high-powered professionals often pay up to $1,000 for tube-fed concoctions which they believe will boost their energy levels and give them a youthful glow.

'We've got peoples' lives hanging in the balance while we're worried about getting through a hangover'

In Las Vegas, a company called Hangover Heaven apparently has buses equipped with as many as 14 IVs to help people get over alcohol-fueled nights.

Some of the bags contain calcium - which is also in 'absolute shortage,' according to the American Society of Health System Pharmacists.

Mr Plogsted added: 'We’ve got [peoples’] lives hanging in the balance while we’re worried about getting through a hangover.'

However, Dr. Sue Decotiis who runs a medical practice in New York told MailOnline that blaming depleting stocks 'designer therapies does not seem plausible.'

She said that there are a myriad of reasons why supplies could be down including distribution problems, local increased demand and decreased production.

She said that if demand for vitamins and supplements remains consistent suppliers should think about increasing production to meet public need.

Originally a craze among the A-list crowd, vitamin IV shots have become increasingly available.

Most patients tend to check in for quick hits on lunch breaks or post work, though some spend up to three hours in the chair.

MailOnline spoke to cardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell who discredited the use of vitamin drips saying:

'There has never been any randomized controlled clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit to these IV infusions whatsoever.

'As a cardiologist I would not recommend 
these types of treatments. Our time can be better spent on preventative 
activities such as diet and exercise and modification of risk factors.'

Though they are not FDA-approved as 
medical treatments IVs, which are typically inserted for 30 to 60 
minutes, are on offer at the offices of even prominent physicians.

Indeed, Dr Marcia Harris, a gynecologist, gives IVs at Patients Medical in New York.

This year alone she has seen a 33per cent increase in requests for the treatment.

She said celebrities such as Simon Cowell, who apparently enjoys weekly IV drips of B12, magnesium and vitamin C to keep his liver in check, are fueling the craze.

Though doctors in a large range of specialties are now offering the IVs, critics say there's little evidence the practice has any health benefits.

Dr Kevin Campbell told MailOnline: 'There has never been any randomized controlled clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit to these IV infusions whatsoever.

'Although I think that certain groups of people may benefit (those with documented deficiencies of a particular vitamin or mineral) widespread use of this technique is unfounded and expensive.

Dr Campbell also believes that the benefits people feel from the infusion may simply be due to the placebo effect.

He added: 'As a cardiologist I would not recommend these types of treatments. Our time can be better spent on preventative activities such as diet and exercise and modification of risk factors.'
