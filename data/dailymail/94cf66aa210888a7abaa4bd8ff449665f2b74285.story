It's an argument that has plagued most households at least once, but now the age-old question of whether toilet paper should sit under or over the roll has finally been solved.

How? By a 124-year-old patent from 22 December 1891 which clearly illustrates an 'over' arrangement for toilet paper.

Writer Owen Williams discovered the toilet paper patent online, and wasted no time in sharing his new-found information with his 8,000 followers on Twitter. 

The in-depth patent created by New York businessman Seth Wheeler clearly shows an 'over' arrangement

The patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets, New York business man Seth Wheeler. 

Wheeler, who was also the owner of the Albany Perforated Wrapping Sheet Company, undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way.

Included in the patent, are Seth's declarations on his new product: 'Be it known that I, SETH WHEELER, of the city and county of Albany, and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Toilet-Paper Rolls.'

Although there's no specific mention of the 'over' arrangement of the toilet paper, the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use.

And it's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated; it's the state of the entire bathroom. 

Other key things to consider? Cleanliness. 

Etiquette expert William Hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit 'over', other bathroom tidiness is important: ‘I very much judge a house, and the house owner, by the state of their guest bathroom.

‘I would question the hygiene of the person's kitchen if the loo wasn’t spotless upon arrival.

Finally, the age-old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved 

‘My own facilities for guests are half bathroom, half temple.

‘There’s no streaky chrome, or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven-knows what germs to fester.

‘If a guest doesn’t come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then I feel I have failed as a host; so many over-worry about their food, spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack, tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint, when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the Harpic.’
