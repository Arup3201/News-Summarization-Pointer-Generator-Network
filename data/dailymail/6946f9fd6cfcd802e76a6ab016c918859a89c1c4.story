The Scotland supporter who caused a huge stir on social media after being spotted in the Uruguay end celebrating their winner against England has been named as Mark McConville from Glasgow.

McConville, 41, was seen cheering with Uruguay fans following Luis Suarez's dramatic winner, waving a Saltire, wearing a Scotland shirt and donning a traditional tartan hat and ginger wig.

He was identified by his brother, Damien McConville, who took to Facebook to share a picture of him.

Time of his life: The 41-year-old was reportedly in Brazil donating footbal shirts to children

'The Tartan Army Fan partying with the Uruguayans is Mark McConville who brought lots of fitba strips for weans in the Amazon region,' he said.

Many England fans may have been less amused, however. The phrase 'insult to injury' certainly comes to mind.

Suarez scored twice to give Uruguay a 2-1 victory, leaving England on the verge of their first exit from the World Cup group stage since 1958.
