Financial strain: A family of three was found dead in a burning Flushing, New York apartment early Tuesday morning, in what is believed to be a murder-suicide caused by money troubles

After containing the blaze, firefighters found the bodies of the Lee family, with the mother and son's throats slashed. It appears Joon Lee then set them on top of a blanket which he lit on fire, before cutting his wrists in a desperate suicide. 

'There are knife wounds, so many we can’t tell how many because of the fire,' a source told the New York Post.  

Authorities also found a suicide note left by the dad, in which he describes how he was struggling to find work. Public records show Joon filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005, listing $100,000 in debt.

At the time of his death, Joon was working for Kearny, New Jersey trucking company Pig Tainer. 

Dispatcher Ruth Markes was shocked to hear of the driver's death.

'We're very surprised that it might be a murder-suicide,' she said. 'He was taking home good money ... He never talked about his family or any problems at home.'

However, a family friend told the police that Joon had been acting erratically recently. 

'He told us the last time they were together the father was drinking and banging his head against a wall,' a law enforcement source told the Post. 'He said the father would go a little nuts sometimes.'

Wife Sung worked in a nail salon while son Brian was a student, studying electromechanics, at Brooklyn Technical High School. 

The two reportedly went back-to school clothes shopping on Monday at Abercrombie & Fitch, according to the New York Daily News. 

Police say they have received no other domestic calls at the apartment.
