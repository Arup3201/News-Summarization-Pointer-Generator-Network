For many, Thanksgiving means relaxing and spending time with loved ones. Employees at megaretailer Macy's, however, may find themselves working Thanksgiving night.

The move would end the department store chain's 155-year tradition of staying closed on Thanksgiving Day.

Macy's stores in several major cities are expected to be affected. The Chicago Sun-Times reports five employees at the Chicago store said their bosses told them to expect to work Thanksgiving night.

Macy's holiday shoppers, like the ones seen in this file photo, may be able to shop as early as 8pm Thanksgiving night

One employee, the paper adds, said she also received a memo stating the store would open on 8pm that night.

The New York store at Herald Square, famed for its role in Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, will also open, according to Women's Wear Daily.

In preparation for the opening, Macy's allegedly sent out a 
survey to its employees at an unidentified store, asking about shift availability. An anonymous source passed the information on to Consumerist.

'The
 Thanksgiving Holiday is also a critical time and we are counting on you
 to help make it successful. Your store will open at 8pm on Thursday, 
November 28th. We would like to know if you are able to work an opening 
shift beginning at 7.30pm on Thursday, November 28th,' the survey reads.

The Chicago Macy's, seen here in this file photo, is expected to have an early opening, according to employees. One said she received a memo warning of an 8m opening on Thanksgiving night

After
 employees stated their availability, they were allegedly taken to 
another page that said they may not have a say in the matter.

'We
 will do our best to honor your preferences,' it reads. 'Based on the 
needs of the business we may still need you to work an opening shift. 
Please be sure to review your schedule for any assigned shifts.'

Chicago employee Sharay Johnson told the Sun-Times she 
expected to work from 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving night to 5 a.m. Friday and 
then again from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday -- but was excited to work 
those hours.

'I love it,' she said. 'It will give me an extra 20 hours of work.'

For the last two years, Macy's opened its 800 nationwide stores at midnight for 'Black Friday,' in efforts to get holiday shoppers looking for early-bird bargains.

Macy's CEO Ted Lundgren told reporters on October 4 thatÂ  he ' will never say "never"' in regards to an early opening, Newsday reports.

'I want to do whatever customers and associates want,' Lundgren said.

Newsday reports that Lundgren described the enthusiasm of employees to work at midnight on Thanksgiving Day.

'Our core associates want to be there early. They're excited, it's the start of the season,' he said.

A formal announcement of the company's plans is expected this week, the Sun-Times reports.
