Two Romanian gypsies face jail after smuggling a child dubbed 'Cinderella' into the UK and forcing her to work as a servant.

The seven-year-old girl was sent to Britain by her penniless mother in the hope of a better life.

But in the UK she was beaten, humiliated, and forced to sleep on the floor while carrying out domestic duties.

Aurel Zlate, 46, and his wife Alexandra Oaie, 43, beat
her 'like a carpet' and the abuse was so bad that when she was rescued 
by police she was dressed in filthy clothes, had scabs all over her head
and her teeth were so rotten they had to be removed.

Husband and wife Aurel Zlatea, 45, and Alexandra Oaie, 44, were responsible for trafficking a seven year old Romanian girl into the country where she was beaten and used as domestic servant

Her treatment at the hands of her 'carers' led to her being dubbed Cinderella, after the abused girl in the fairy-tale.

The little girl, who was stolen from her mother after her tormentors lied that she would get a better life, told police officers she 'hated' her female captor, adding: 'I can't stand her because she beats me all the time.

'She was always saying work, work, I was getting dirty, my hands and feet were getting dirty.

'I would tidy up and I would do all the rooms and they wouldn't do anything.'

A child psychologist who assessed the child when she was eventually taken into care found she couldn't count to ten in her own language and was unable to express even basic emotions.

The pair sobbed in the dock at Croydon Crown Court as the guilty verdicts were read out

And it emerged that her tormentors' children had also sexually abused another man who was trafficked over to the UK.

Romanians Zlate and Oaie, who is known by the nickname Ferma, were found guilty of trafficking the youngster in October 2010 with the intention of exploiting her.

They will be sentenced later today.

The pair, who have eight children of their own and are on benefits, were also convicted of neglecting and ill-treating her while she was in their care.

The jury were told the family had a 
string of convictions for offences including shoplifting, going equipped
to steal, attempted theft and common assault, dating back to 2003.

The
court heard that a 53-year-old man was also forced to come to
the UK, where he was sexually assaulted and forced to work for no pay.

He
was locked in a shed by the couples' two sons, raped, beaten and forced
to work as a driver and steal scrap metal for his captors.

Unable
to speak English, the man, who cannot be named, fled the home in Wood 
Green, north London, to a police station in March last year. He let officers know he was in trouble by scrawling SOS on a scrap of paper.

The couple and their son Marian Neamu, 25, were convicted of bringing him to the UK with the intention of exploiting him. Neamu
and his brother Florin Zlate, 23, were also found guilty of raping him 
as he dared to ask for food during a New Year's Eve party.

Neamu
was convicted of one count of trafficking, one count of ABH, one count 
of assault by penetration, one count of rape and one count of false 
imprisonment.

Florin Zlate was convicted of one 
count of ABH, one count of assault by penetration, one count of rape and
one count of false imprisonment. The sex charges relate to the 53-year-old man.

The pair, who ran an illegal scrap metal business from their three-bedroom terraced house in Wood Green while claiming thousands of pounds of benefits, were also found guilty of trafficking a 53-year-old man to the UK from Romania.

Both sobbed in the dock at Croydon Crown Court as the guilty verdicts were read out. The maximum sentence for trafficking is 14 years.

The sickening story only came to the attention of police authorities after a 53-year-old man - who was also trafficked and sexually abused by the family - escaped from their clutches and alerted police.

Himself beaten and mistreated, the man was so alarmed about the youngster's living conditions he named her Censusreasa, the Romanian name for Cinderella.

He told the jury: 'Ferma treated her badly. She hit her, and made her do things a girl of six or seven should not have to do.

'Sweeping the floor, carrying debris on the building site, she was like a little slave looking after the youngest children.

'She was changing nappies, feeding them and making up their bottles and feeding the animals.

'She would be hit on the head and shouted at and sworn at. The other children would beat her like she was a carpet.

'She was just like Cinderella, she was never allowed to do a day of school.'

When police went to the home they found the girl and put her in emergency care. Zlatea claimed he was the father, handing over a fake birth certificate and a court order giving him custody.

But a DNA test proved neither were the parents, and when police visited Romania they found the true mum - a cleaner working for the Zlatae family.

She said she had been approached by Oaie who wanted to adopt the child as she believed she could give her a better life and helped provide the fake documentation.

But in his evidence the male victim, who had worked as an electrician in Romania until he fell on hard times, described how her life was miserable from the moment she was taken from her mother.

He said that the little girl sat 'like a frightened animal' in the back of a van as she was brought to Britain.

She even vomited on herself during the journey to the UK but was too scared to make a sound.

The court heard Oaie was the 'boss' of the house, where 16 people including her own eight children lived and claimed benefits, while running a scrap metal business from the back garden.
