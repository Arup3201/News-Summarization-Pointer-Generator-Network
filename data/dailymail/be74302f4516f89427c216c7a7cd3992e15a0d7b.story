A bullying former police detective casually browsed for a knife in Sainsbury’s before using it to stab his estranged wife to death.

Yesterday Ivan Esack was found guilty of murdering Natalie, a petite 33-year-old, and faces life in jail.

A jury was shown CCTV pictures of his chilling shopping trip, showing him passing through a self-service till. He then marched into her hairdressing salon and stabbed her 11 times in front of a horrified assistant.

Esack, 38, had abused his wife for years and was a serial love cheat but was enraged when she left him and met a new boyfriend.

A mountain of evidence showed he had 
repeatedly threatened murder, telling her she had three choices: ‘Death,
death or death.’ Esack also sinisterly intoned: ‘You’re a walking dead 
woman...tick, tock, tick, tock.’

Yet Esack, an alcoholic, cocaine 
addict and bisexual serial adulterer, tried to escape justice by 
claiming he had  ‘narcissistic personality disorder’.

His lawyers said the former Kent 
Police officer never had to face up to his  failings because his wealthy
father showered him with money.

Esack also boasted of Conservative 
Party links, claiming Home Office minister and local MP Damian Green 
called him at home.

He said he was also courted to become a councillor 
and had the potential to become Prime Minister.

But the jury rejected his defence of ‘diminished responsibility’ and convicted him of murdering Mrs Esack last April.

He will be sentenced on Monday at 
Maidstone Crown Court.

As an ex-policeman, Esack may serve his term on a
segregation wing with child sex offenders.

Former colleagues at Kent Police face 
searching questions over missed opportunities to act in the months 
before the murder.

Four times, Mrs Esack or her boyfriend Justin 
Khadaroo, 34, tried to raise the alarm about his rages.

A month before she died, police were 
told that Esack had strangled his estranged wife until she was 
unconscious in the hairdressers where he later killed her.

In October 
2011, she told officers Esack had threatened to kill her with his 
shotgun. Weeks later, he voluntarily handed in the gun.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating why the force did not refer the case after Mrs Esack’s murder.

Esack was brought up in Middlesbrough 
by his English mother while his Trinidadian father, a civil engineer, 
worked in Abu Dhabi.

He moved to London and worked in Harrods, boasting of mixing with the rich and famous.

Esack did a drama course but failed dismally to make a career of it and his father bought him a new house in Ashford, Kent.

He met Natalie at a gym and, despite 
her family’s concern, they were married in 2006. His father funded the 
beauty and hair salon for her on Ashford High Street.

Esack joined the police in 2003. 
Defence psychiatrist Timothy Rogers told the court: ‘He probably very 
much enjoyed the power and prestige of being a police officer.’

But Esack had to sit a basic exam four
times before briefly becoming a detective. Then, he began snorting £500
worth of cocaine a month and drinking heavily. In 2009, he quit on the 
spot when asked to change from casual clothes into a shirt and tie.

Esack’s numerous affairs with men and 
women drove his wife to leave. But he bombarded her with aggressive and 
threatening texts and calls, and on Boxing Day 2011, she reluctantly 
went on a doomed ‘make or break’ holiday to Mexico.

Kent Police yesterday insisted their hands were tied because Mrs Esack refused to press charges.

But senior investigating officer DCI 
Paul Fotheringham admitted: ‘The fact Ivan Esack used to be a police 
officer – somebody whose role was to protect people – makes me extremely
embarrassed.’

Ashford Tories said Esack was a member
but there was no record of Mr Green speaking to him or that he had been
considered as a councillor.

Detectives knew Natalie Esack suffered domestic abuse from her estranged husband before he knifed her to death, it has emerged.

Hairdresser Mrs Esack, 33, spoke to officers on four separate occasions about ex-police detective Ivan Esack, from 2009 up until a month before her death.

But, according to police, Mrs Esack was unwilling for 38-year-old Esack to face prosecution and she refused to co-operate with their inquiries.

Tragic: Mrs Esack, 33, spoke to officers on four separate occasions about ex-police detective Ivan Esack, from 2009 up until a month before her death.

Weeks before he fatally stabbed her, Mrs Esack told police he tried to strangle her but she apparently refused to divulge further details.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said he could not say whether police could have prevented her from being killed as Esack was a 'determined' man.

But he said: 'Certainly, with the information that we found now, and if Natalie had given us evidence or a statement in relation to the abuse, we could have done something about it.'

Police said that 5ft 1in hairdresser Mrs Esack failed to return their phone calls or attend meetings to follow up the reports of abuse.

December
14, 2009: Police attended an abandoned 999 call at the Esacks’ home 
after Mrs Esack called asking for help following a bust-up. No offences 
were identified by police

October 25 2011 Following the breakdown
of their marriage, Mrs Esack visited Ashford police station to report a
series of abusive text messages and calls from her husband.

It was noted that Esack had access to a firearm and had made previous threats to shoot her and her father.

Mrs Esack received harassment advice from police. She sent Esack a text 
message telling him any further contact between them should be via a 
solicitor.

The following day police visited Esack and told him of Mrs Esack’s wish to have nothing more to do with him. A month later Esack voluntarily surrendered his firearms licence and gun to police.

February 11 2012: Mrs Esack contacted Kent Police after Esack told 
her he intended to kill himself. Officers visited and Esack was admitted
to hospital for assessment but later sent home

March 13 2012: A month before the killing, her new boyfriend, Justin Khadaroo, dialled 999. Police attended but Mrs Esack said she did not want to give a statement 
or support a prosecution. However, she did confirm that Esack had tried 
to strangle her the previous day.

In the background Mrs Esack could be heard telling Esack: 'You aren’t allowed to come in, you tried to kill me.'

They described her as a 'private' person keen to shield Esack from prosecution despite his behaviour towards her.

Mr
Fotheringham said: 'We did have reports in relation to Natalie 
suffering domestic abuse which we did follow up with Natalie but she 
didn’t want to support any prosecution against Ivan.

'Natalie
was a very private person and it’s clear that she knew that if she 
reported Ivan to us it would impact on him. Being the type of person she
was, she didn’t want that to happen.'

The detective said it was common for abused people not to want to support prosecutions of their abusers, and that he did not want Mrs Esack’s unwillingness to engage with police to be seen as a criticism of her.

He added: 'People suffering from domestic abuse, I think, certainly want it to stop but they don’t necessarily want anything to happen to the person perpetrating the abuse.

'In this case, certainly from what Natalie told her family and her friends, she was almost more interested in not harming Ivan than what was happening to her.'

Asked whether police could have prevented her death, Mr Fotheringham said: 'I don’t know. A determined individual as he was and with the marriage breakdown, I don’t know whether we could have done, to be honest.'

No referral was made to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, about the force’s previous contact and no disciplinary issues were found, he added.

An IPCC spokeswoman said: 'The IPCC did not receive a referral from Kent Police in connection with previous police contact with Natalie Esack before her death.

'We understand Kent considered it but felt it didn’t meet the referral criteria.

'Kent Police has provided us with further information regarding this decision, which we are considering.'
