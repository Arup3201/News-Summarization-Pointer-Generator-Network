Driver: Jack Hiscock, 24, above, admitted causing the death of his friend Jack Savage, 20, in a drink-fuelled car crash

A young driver who caused the death of his best friend in a drink-fuelled car crash has been jailed for 28 months.

Tragic Jack Savage, 20, was a passenger in a Ford Fiesta driven by his friend, 24-year-old Jack Hiscock, in the early hours of May 11, this year.

Hiscock, who had been drinking before getting behind the wheel, crashed the vehicle into an articulated lorry, leaving Mr Savage with fatal injuries.

Police arrested Hiscock following the crash in Swindon, Wiltshire, and he later admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol.

Mr Savage's family had pledged to stand by 
Hiscock despite his actions - stating that their son would not have 
wanted his best friend to suffer.

However, he was sentenced to 28 months in prison by Judge Douglas Field, sitting at Swindon Crown Court, and banned from driving for three years.Â 

Speaking after the hearing, Police constable Lucy Fair of Wiltshire Police's Serious Collision Investigation Team, said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a young man lost his life.

'Jack Savage and Jack Hiscock were best friends and Hiscock will have to live knowing that his actions on that day in May resulted in the death of his friend.

'This case highlights the importance of driving with due care and attention at all times of the night and day. A driving error made in a split second can have fatal consequences.

'It also highlights the dangers of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol impairs judgment and awareness.

'Our thoughts remain with the family of Jack Savage at this difficult time.'

Mr Savage's family previously said they were supporting Hiscock 'as one of our own', as their son would have wanted his friend to be treated with leniency.

His mother, Tanya, said that before his death, her son had known someone who was driving a car which crashed into a tree, and the passenger subsequently died.

She said Mr Savage had felt sorry for the driver having to live with the guilt - a conversation the Savage family had in their minds after his death.

'We do not see the need for him to suffer more than he already is, and we know that our Jack would have wanted this,' she told the Swindon Advertiser.

'Everyone is supporting him and we stand by him as one of our own. So, we have put in a plea for leniency for when it comes to sentencing.

'He has got this to live with for the rest of his life, and that is a sentence that will never go away.'

Mr Savage's father, Steve, told the BBC: 'Going to prison as he's expecting, whilst it serves a purpose to the public, it serves no purpose for him.'
