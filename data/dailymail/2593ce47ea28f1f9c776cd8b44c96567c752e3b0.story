Apple suffered a fall in profits in the last financial quarter despite selling a record-breaking 33.8 million iPhones, figures released by the technology giant have revealed.

The company also experienced a drop in sales of Mac computers in the three months to the end of September, while greater China revenue climbed just 6 
per cent even though two smartphone models hit the shelves there last month.

The firm's quarterly profit of $7.5 
billion (£4.3 billion) was down from $8.2 billion (£5 billion) in the 
same three months of 2012.

Disappointment: Apple released their colorful iPhone 5C models last month in an attempt to compete with cheaper phones made by Samsung and Google. But it was the iPhone 5S that proved the better seller

Samsung Electronics shipped a record
88.4million smartphones in the third quarter to take its global market 
share above 35 per cent, while rival Apple's slice thinned, research 
data showed today.

The 
figure marked a 55 per cent surge for Samsung over the same period last 
year, the independent research firm Strategy Analytics said.

The South Korean tech company's market share swelled to 35.2 per cent from 32.9 percent in the third quarter of 2012.

Apple's market share dipped from 15.6 per cent to 13.4 per cent.

Samsung
last week posted a 26 per cent increase in third-quarter net profit, 
bolstered by demand for smartphones and memory chips.

Gross profit margin fell to 37 per cent from 40 per cent in the same period last year.

Quarterly revenue was $37.5 billion 
(£23.3 billion), up from the same time last year when Apple announced 
revenue of $36 billion (£22.3 billion).

International sales made up 60 per cent of revenue for this quarter according to the California-based company.

Wall
Street had hoped for a stronger beat on quarterly sales after the 
company predicted in September that its revenue and margins would come 
in at the high end of its own forecasts.

Shares in Apple, which have gained 17 per cent since its upbeat forecast last month, slid as much as 5 per cent yesterday before recovering. 

'We would have expected higher gross margins, Morning start analyst Brian Colello told Reuters.

Keeping faith: Apple's CEO Tim Cook (pictured) remained optimistic on a conference call with analysts, saying he expected a 'really great' holiday shopping season

'With the higher price phones and clear preferences toward the 5S, we 
were all expecting more of a gross margin boost for the December 
quarter.'

Experts says consumers are more interested in buying a combinations of older and cheaper products.

But
Apple's CEO Tim Cook remained optimistic on a conference call with 
analysts, saying he expected a 'really great' holiday shopping season.

Apple
sold a total of 33.8million of its smartphones, a record for the final 
quarter, up from 26.9m in the same period last year.

It
was also a rise from the third financial quarter, when 31.2million of 
the devices were sold - but could not match the 37.4million sold in the 
second quarter, between January and March.

The latest results include the first few days that the newest iPhones, the iPhone 5c and 5s went on sale in September.

In
the past quarter, Apple sold 14.1million iPads, a slight rise from 
14million between July and September 2012. It sold 4.6million Macs, down
from 4.9million in the same period last year.

The
results come days after Apple announced the launch of the thinner and 
lighter iPad Air and a revamped iPad Mini, both of which go on sale in 
November.

Apple chief 
executive Tim Cook said: 'We're pleased to report a strong finish to an 
amazing year with record fourth quarter revenue, including sales of 
almost 34 million iPhones.

'We're
excited to go into the holidays with our new iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, 
iOS 7, the new iPad mini with Retina Display and the incredibly thin and
light iPad Air, new MacBook Pros, the radical new Mac Pro, OS X 
Mavericks and the next generation iWork and iLife apps for OS X and 
iOS.'

Apple is predicting revenue of between $55 billion (£34 billion) and $58 billion (£36 billion) in the first quarter of 2014.

Overall
for the year to the end of September, Apple's revenue was $171 billion 
(£105 billion) - up from 157 billion (£97 billion) the previous year.

End-of-year
profits fell from 41.7 billion (£26 billion) in 2012 to 37bn (£23 
billion) in the 12 months to the end of September.

In
a conference call to investors, analysts and journalists after 
announcing the results, Cook said he saw 'significant opportunities' in 
new product categories, as well as across the current Apple spectrum.

He did not give further details, but said that Apple's skills in hardware, software and services were 'very, very unique'.

'I
think no one has a set of skills like this,' added Cook.

'And we 
obviously believe we can use our skills in building other great products
that are in categories where we don't currently participate today, and 
we're pretty confident on that.'
