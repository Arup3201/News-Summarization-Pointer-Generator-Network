For most viewers, the last time they saw Michael Buerk on television, he was smartly dressed, calmly relaying the world’s news.

So they can be forgiven their shock at seeing the 68-year-old’s return to the screen last night on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here.

Face aghast and stretched by the wind, the 30-year veteran of BBC News looked anything but composed as he skydived from a helicopter.

And unfortunately for the self-declared hater of celebrity culture, this was not the only ordeal he had to endure on the first episode of the ITV show, as he was taught to twerk like a Playboy bunny and shake hands like a rap star.

He may have reported on horrors from around the world but, faced with the jump, Buerk told viewers: ‘I may cry like a child and have a nervous breakdown, this is the stuff of nightmares’.

Former Playboy bunny Kendra Wilkinson, 29, went even further, becoming a quivering wreck when confronted with the prospect of skydiving.

She admitted heights were here ‘number one fear’ and added: ‘I don’t know if I can do this, this is beyond anything I ever imagined doing, there is no greater dear in my life, and I’m so scared’. 

She could only be consoled when rapper Tinchy Stryder, 28, gave her a hug.

However, the musician didn’t fare much better, trying to pull out of the challenge at the last minute as the instructor jumped. On the ground he said it would be his ‘first and last time’ skydiving.

The jump was part of a challenge that saw them, along with the Melanie Sykes and Jimmy Bullard rescue fellow contestants – reality television star Gemma Collins, Coronation Street actor Craig Charles, motorcycle racer Carl Fogarty, model Nadia Forde and ‘Allo ‘Allo! star Vicki Michelle from the Jungle Slammer.

In a twist to the show’s normal format, this series has seen the celebrities split into two groups before arriving in the jungle. 

One group was given a final night of luxury, while the other was thrown into a makeshift jail from which they would have to be freed by the other contestants completing challenges.

When Buerk was first introduced to fellow contestants Strdyer and Miss Wilkinson, there was an immediate culture clash.

The Radio 4 presenter looked lost for words as the adult model tried to get him to twerk. She said: ‘We should do some shots and get this party going. Let’s twerk or something – pick up your pants Michael to loosen them’.

To which he said: ‘Oh right, it’s a bit similar to belly dancing’.

In an equally cringe-worthy moment, he was talked through a complicated hip-hop handshake by the Ghanaian-born Stryder.
