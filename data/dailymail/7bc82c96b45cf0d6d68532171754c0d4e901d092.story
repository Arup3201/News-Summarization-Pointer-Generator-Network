It's set to be a happier Easter for your wallet this year with many top-selling chocolate eggs costing less than last year.

Cadbury chocolate eggs are on average 4.4 per cent cheaper in supermarkets, while Nestlé ones – including Smarties and KitKat – are down by 4.2 per cent, an analysis by BrandView.com reveals.

Supermarkets' own-label eggs are also six per cent cheaper, according to industry experts.

No shelling out: Cadbury chocolate eggs are on average 4.4 per cent cheaper in supermarkets this year

Across the 'big four' supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons – the average price a kilo of Easter egg has fallen by 1.4 per cent.

However, Mars and Ferrero eggs are up by 4.2 and 4.1 per cent respectively. And Thorntons' have stayed the same price on average.

Trade magazine The Grocer, which reported the price drop, said: 'In terms of retailer activity, Morrisons has driven the decline by slashing the price of branded eggs by 7.3 per cent on average, while prices rose at Tesco and Sainsbury's - by 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent on average respectively - and dipped 0.4 per cent at Asda.

'Morrisons is selling some of the most popular branded medium eggs for £1 - in line with Asda - versus £1.50 at Morrisons last year. 

'But Tesco upped the competition on these core lines last week, slashing its price from £1.50 to 75p.'

The magazine says that looking at all Easter eggs - not only those for sale this year and last -suggests retailers are changing their product mix to offer lower prices.
