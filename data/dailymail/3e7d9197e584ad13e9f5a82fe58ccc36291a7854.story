Arsenal are interested in Paris St Germain forward Jean-Christophe Bahebeck.

The 21-year-old scored twice against Brazil in the final of the Toulon tournament at the weekend to finish top scorer with four goals.

PSG though are prepared to let him leave on a free transfer as long as they get 50 percent of any sell on.

His representative Willie McKay said: 'When you consider the prices being asked for English players of similar level it's a very good deal. We have a lot of interest from English clubs.'

Bahebeck had a spell on loan at Valenciennes last season.
