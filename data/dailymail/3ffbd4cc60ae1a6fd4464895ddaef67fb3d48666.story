From dressing the leading ladies to kitting out the England football team with their world cup suits, the M&S design team are on a roll this year.

And now the high street powerhouse has unveiled The Best of British Collection, which aims to offer quality and luxury pieces while supporting home grown talent and expertise.

The summer collection, the store's third range, is filled with classic tailoring and contemporary formal wear, as well as more casual jersey tops and dresses.

It's back! M&S has launched its second Best of British range (blouse, £69, skirt, £99, loafers, £165)

Of the collection, which is full of dove grey and soft peach pieces, M&S say: 'The Best of British collection is a true celebration of British craftsmanship and creativity.

'It combines our rich heritage with modern styling to create an edit of timeless pieces with an emphasis on true British craftsmanship and quality.

High street goes high end: The new range aims to offer luxurious and high quality garments (waistcoat, £149, shirt, £89, trousers, £129)

Fresh: The range is filled with classic tailoring and contemporary formal wear in fresh grey and peach hues, left, top, £79, skirt, £69, satchel, £299, right, blouse, £99, bomber, £199

Luxe: Speaking about the collection, M&S say: 'The Best of British collection is a true celebration of British craftsmanship and creativity' (top, £59, trousers, £99, brogue, £165)

'All garments are made in Britain in a selection of premium fabrics including luxury Scottish cashmere through to fine Yorkshire cloths and each piece is finished to the highest level of detail, a standard synonymous with British design.'

Whilst the
 collection aims to celebrate high quality design and luxurious fabrication, 
this season also sees the launch of four jersey dresses and two jersey 
tops from a supplier and manufacturer in Hinckley, aiming to add a more casual touch to the range.

The Best of British Collection is available online, internationally and in selected UK stores from May 2014.

Quality control: All garments are made in Britain in a selection of premium fabrics including luxury Scottish cashmere through to fine Yorkshire cloths (jacket, £199, dress, £159, brogue, £165)

Sizes range from 6-18 with prices starting from £19.50 for a leather cuff to £249 for a printed jacket.

M&S stalwart Oliver Cheshire modelled the menswear range last year, telling MailOnline: 'The collection is out of this world. It's all classic British cuts. Younger men can wear it.

'I've worn some of the pieces out already, Pixie [Lott - his popstar girlfriend] really loves them.'

Last week, England players including captain Steven Gerrard, Chelsea's Ashley Cole and 
Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana swapped their football boots 
for smart shoes to model the M&S Three Lions' official World Cup suits - and
 both football and fashion fans will be pleased to know they can emulate
 the soccer stars' look for £199.

Seasonal styles: The smart range is available in sizes 6-18 with prices starting from £19.50 for a leather cuff to £249 for a printed jacket (dress, £179, shirt, £89)

The suits, which will be worn
by England manager Roy Hodgson and his players, come in charcoal grey and are packed with special design features.

These include an embroidered World Cup winners' star on the inside envelope 
pocket, the England crest on the Autograph label and a red, white and 
blue sleeve and pocket lining.
