Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital spent almost an hour in surgery trying to reduce swelling on Australian cricketer Phil Hughes' brain after he was struck with a cricket ball. 

The hospital's spokesman David Faktor likened Hughes' condition to someone who had been 'king hit'.

Hughes was severely injured during day one of the Sheffield Shield at Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday.

'[The cricketer] is still in a very, very critical condition,' Mr Faktor said.

'The operation was quick, less than an hour to alleviate swelling on the brain.

'It's really similar to a king hit situation where you have bleeding on the brain, what's called a subdural haematoma. 

'In the case of a king hit, it's the pavement you often fall back and sustain a fracture on the skull.

'Depending on the damage that does or what it hits - a nerve or a vessel - there's a real range of injury severity.'

Mr Faktor said medical officers intubated Hughes at the scene and he was also placed in an induced coma.

Intubation involves a tube being inserted into a patient's trachea to help them breathe easier. 

'Now it's just a waiting game as surgeons wait for the swelling on his brain to go down,' Mr Faktor said. 

It could be 24 to 48 hours before the extent of Hughes' injuries are known.

Australasian College of Emergency Medicine president Anthony Cross said being hit by a cricket ball at high speeds could leave someone with a range of injuries, including those that ended in a concussion. 

He said injuries caused by a cricket ball were uncommon because of helmets like the one Hughes was wearing.

Dr Cross said the concern did not lie with a ball causing external injuries but with it fracturing the skull, which protects the brain inside and prevent internal injuries.

He said this could cause mild or severe injuries as well as bruising the brain and the sooner it was treated the better, saying 'time is of the essence'.

'At the other end of the spectrum the thing people will be worried about is bleeds on the brain,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

'If there is any major bleeding inside the brain you have the issue of the build-up of blood within the skull, and that blood causes pressure on the brain which can cause further injury.

'Basically you are squeezing the cells, but that increased pressure also prevents the oxygenated blood getting into the brain, and the venous blood from flowing out.'

Injuries of this nature are more commonly a result of road accidents or at times alcohol-related violence.
