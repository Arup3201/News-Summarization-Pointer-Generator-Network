A mother filmed the moment another woman tried to slam into her car while she was driving with her young daughter.

Sherri Norman was driving in Randleman, North Carolina when she claims another woman, who was speeding, tried repeatedly to pass her, ultimately succeeding.

It did not end there however, as video shows the woman repeatedly stopping short to get Norman's car to slam into her own vehicle, veering off the road to try and side slam her car, and then ultimately stopping and getting out to begin punching Hastings through an open window on the driver's side of the vehicle.

A woman was filmed flipping off another driver in a road rage incident on Saturday

This as the woman's daughter Destiny can be heard screaming out of fear and crying in the backseat.

That woman, 40-year-old Kristin Leigh Phillips, has now been charged with reckless driving to endanger, assault and battery, injury to personal property, driving left of center and two counts of communicating threats according to Fox 8. 

'I knew what was going to happen. I wanted it on tape. Twice the lady tried to pass me on a two-lane road with double lines on a hill,' said Norman. 

Only after the woman managed to role her window up did the other woman return to her car

'She about ran me off road first time. She got behind me a second time and then went to go around again. I let her have the road, called 911, reported her and her plate number… I started phone video which was in a holder on dashboard — hands free.'

She gave the video to the police on Saturday after the incident occurred and Phillips was arrested Monday.
