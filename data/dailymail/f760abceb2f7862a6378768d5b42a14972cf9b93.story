David Cameron was repeatedly put on the spot yesterday over how far somebody confronted by a raider would be allowed to go under a new ‘bash a burglar’ law unveiled by his party.

The Prime Minister – who recounted the ‘terrible’ experience of having his Skoda stolen in a burglary – said he believed intruders gave up their rights when they entered another person’s home.

When pressed as to what this meant in practice, he said that the new law would not permit, for example, the stabbing of a burglar who had been knocked unconscious in a struggle.

Crackdown: Chris Grayling wants to 'dispel doubts' over the right to fight off intruders

But the announcement raised questions over the precise boundaries that would apply.

Mr Cameron told ITV News: ‘People need
 the certainty to know that unless they did something grossly 
disproportionate, as we’re going to put it, then they are basically in 
the right.’

He added: ‘And frankly when a burglar 
crosses your threshold and enters your home, we should worry less about 
their rights and worry more about the rights of the household, the home,
 the family whose privacy and whose place they are invading.’

He recalled how raiders once burgled 
his home then escaped in his car, telling Sky: ‘I’ve been burgled a 
couple of times when I lived in London, in North Kensington. There was 
one occasion when I left the keys in my car and they loaded up my Skoda 
and drove off. It is a horrible feeling when your house has been 
invaded.’

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s 
announcement that he would change the law to allow the use of 
‘disproportionate force’ against burglars in the heat of the moment 
delighted MPs at the Tory conference yesterday. Only the use of ‘grossly
 disproportionate force’ will remain outlawed. Currently, householders 
are entitled to use only ‘reasonable’ force.

Plans: Theresa May tells the Tory conference that victims will have a greater say in the justice system

The plan was attacked by the civil 
liberties group Liberty, whose director Shami Chakrabarti said: 
‘Terrified householders defending themselves are already protected, so 
the irresponsible announcement can only be designed to make people 
afraid or actually encourage vigilante execution.’

Mr Grayling also pledged that sex attackers and killers would be jailed for life in a new ‘two strikes and you’re out’ policy.

Life terms will automatically go to 
anyone twice given jail terms of ten years or more for rape, sex crimes 
against children, serious GBH and terrorism offences, and ‘causing or 
allowing the death of a child’.

The Justice Secretary said: ‘Everyone 
deserves a second chance. But those who commit the most serious offences
 cannot be allowed to just go on and on causing harm, distress and 
injury.’

Home Secretary Theresa May also unveiled plans to allow crime victims to decide how the thug should be punished.

They will be offered a menu of sanctions – such as ordering offenders to pay compensation or fix the damage they have caused.

Any offender who refuses to comply 
will face stiff action by the police or courts.

Mr Grayling, who will 
also promise to toughen community punishments, will delight the Right 
with his new law on burglars.

It will mean someone who is confronted
 by a burglar and has reason to fear for their safety, or their family’s
 safety and in the heat of the moment uses force that later seems 
‘disproportionate’ will not be guilty of an offence.

Rights: Andy and Tracey Ferrie, pictured, were confronted in their home by burglars

This could include the use of lethal force. Only force which is ‘grossly’ disproportionate will not be permitted.

Mr
 Grayling said: ‘Being confronted by an intruder in your home is 
terrifying, and the public should be in no doubt that the law is on 
their side. That is why I am strengthening the current law.

‘Householders who act instinctively and honestly in self-defence are crime victims  and should be treated that way.

‘We
 need to dispel doubts in this area once and for all, and I am very 
pleased to be delivering on the pledge that we made in Opposition.’

The demands for change began when Mr 
Martin was imprisoned for killing one burglar and wounding another who 
entered his Norfolk farm.

No sympathy: Judge Michael Pert QC spoke out after a lawyer for one of the men who broke into the Ferries' remote farmhouse, pictured, asked for leniency

More
 recent cases suggest prosecutors and judges have been giving greater 
weight to the legal right of householders to use ‘reasonable force’ to 
defend themselves.

Last 
month Judge Michael Pert QC spoke out after a lawyer demanded leniency 
for a criminal who, he said, had been hit with a shotgun by Andy Ferrie 
at his home near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in ‘a form of summary 
justice’.

The judge replied:
 ‘If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a 
legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to 
court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.’

Mr
 Grayling’s move follows changes made by his predecessor Ken Clarke, 
which removed a legal requirement for householders to retreat.

Guilty: Burglars Joshua O'Gorman , left, and Daniel Mansell, who had a string of previous convictions, were both jailed after they were shot after breaking into the home of Andy Ferrie in Welby, near Melton Mowbray

Guidance for police has also been changed to encourage fewer arrests of those defending their home.

Mr Grayling will also introduce measures to make sure every community sentence contains a proper punishment.

They
 include a requirement to include a punitive element in every community 
order, a power to impose location monitoring  and the removal of the 
£5,000 cap on compensation in the magistrates courts

Mr
 Grayling said: ‘We inherited a weak, “soft-option” programme from 
Labour, which saw offenders working only minimal hours or simply not 
completing their sentences.

‘Yes, we should rehabilitate. But criminals also need to receive a proper punishment.'VIDEO: David Cameron says people need to be able to defend themselves...
