Convicted murderer Jodi Arias appeared in court today in her striped and crumpled prison jumpsuit as she waits to find out whether she will face the death penalty.

During a hearing on Tuesday in Phoenix, Judge Sherry Stephens gave attorneys additional time to file motions as Arias' lawyers want the jury's finding that made her eligible for the death penalty vacated.

Arias, 32, looked tired and worn with her hair knotted in a bun, compared to the dramatic performances she had often put on during her months-long trial.

A new hearing was set for August 26. Arias was convicted of murder on May 8 in the death of boyfriend Travis Alexander. He had been stabbed 27 times, his throat slit open and was shot in the head at his Arizona home in June 2008.

The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision in May on whether to sentence Arias to life in prison or death.

While
 her murder conviction stands, prosecutors must now decide whether to 
try again for a death sentence with a new jury or to settle for life in 
prison.

Arias, a former waitress from California, admitted she killed Alexander, but claimed self-defense.

In May, the eight-man, four-woman jury that convicted Arias of murder and quickly ruled her eligible for the death penalty subsequently failed to reach a consensus as to whether she should be executed, prompting a penalty-phase mistrial.

In court filings, prosecutors have asked the judge to begin new penalty-phase proceedings on July 30.

But defense attorneys asked that the proceedings be delayed until January because of scheduling conflicts and the possibility that Arias might want to call witnesses to speak on her behalf.

State prosecutors have the option of retrying the sentencing phase before a new jury, or could allow her to be sentenced to a mandatory life-term by the judge.

If there is another jury deadlock at retrial, a judge would sentence Arias to spend the rest of her life in prison, or to life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.

County Attorney Bill Montgomery has consistently maintained since the first jury deadlocked that he would ask the new jurors to put Arias to death.

After the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on May 23, Montgomery said that his office would assess its next steps, but was proceeding 'with the intent to retry the penalty phase'.

The trial began in January and become a staple for U.S. cable television viewers with its tale of a soft-spoken, young woman charged with such a brutal crime. The trial was punctuated with graphic testimony and bloody photographs.

Arias, 33, took the stand for a marathon 18 days and maintained throughout that the killing was in self-defense despite fierce cross-examination by prosecutors.
