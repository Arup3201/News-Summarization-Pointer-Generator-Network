A family lifted from a disabled sailboat hundreds of miles off the Mexican coast with their sick 1-year-old thanked rescuers and defended their 'maritime life' in their first public comments since returning to land.

Eric and Charlotte Kaufman said in a blog posting that their children have been sailing on boats for a long time and that the 'modern cruising family' dates back several decades.

The Kaufmans were on a round-the-world cruise with their 3- and 1-year-old daughters when the vomiting, feverish younger girl forced them to call for help.

Back on dry land: The Kaufman family are seen in this April 9 U.S. Navy photo deboarding the guided missile frigate USS Vandegrift after they were rescued with a sick baby nearly 2,000 miles out at sea in a sailboat

Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, with daughters, Lyra, 1, and Cora, 3, were rescued and returned to San Diego by a Navy warship

The couple asked critics to reserve 
judgment and wait for more details. Without elaborating, they said there
 were many inaccuracies reported in the news media about their 
daughter's health, their vessel's condition and the 'overall maritime 
situation.'

The Rebel 
Heart, the 36-foot sailboat that had been their home for seven years, is
 at the bottom of the ocean 900 miles off Mexico, sunk by rescuers 
because it was taking on water after losing its steering and most of its
 communications.

'We 
have been happy with the maritime life we have been able to share with 
our daughters. Even as we write this, several other boats are crossing 
the same stretch of water that Rebel Heart was on, with families who 
seek to show their children the world,' the couple wrote in a posting 
dated Thursday and titled, 'twenty four hours back in San Diego.'

The
 couple thanked the 129th Rescue Wing of the California Air National 
Guard and the crew aboard the USS Vandergrift, saying, 'We will remember
 them forever.'

In 
response to unsolicited offers of support, they asked that donations be 
sent instead to That Others May Live Foundation, a nonprofit group that 
assists families of Air Force rescuers who die on duty.

Sailors from the frigate USS Vandegrift assist in the rescue of the Kaufman family with a sick infant on the ship's small boat

A
 satellite phone ping from the sailboat on April 3 set off a huge rescue
 effort that involved skydiving National Guardsmen, three federal 
agencies, a plane, a frigate and scores of personnel.

When
 the family and their rescuers returned to California on Wednesday, 
sailors said poor visibility, winds of 10 knots and rough seas kept them
 from sending a rescue boat to the Kaufmans for hours.

When
 they reached the family's sailboat, 5- to 8-foot waves forced them to 
offload one person at a time. The effort took two hours.

The ocean rescue set off a serious debate
 over parenting, and the propriety of hitting the high seas with two 
kids young enough to be in diapers.

In
 a photo released by the Navy, the family looked like typical 
vacationers, with father Eric dressed in shorts and a baseball cap while
 lugging bags, and his wife, Charlotte, walking behind him, holding the 
toddler in a strap-on carrier and grasping the hand of her 3-year-old 
daughter.

The happy 
scene was a far cry from the miserable conditions described by Navy 
sailors who spoke to reporters after the ship moved to the San Diego 
mainland later in the day without the Kaufmans.

It
 was scheduled to move on to the San Diego mainland later in the day but
 without the Kaufmans, who said they want to tend to their 1-year-old 
daughter, Lyra, first and get some rest before talking publicly, 
Charlotte Kaufman's sister, Sariah English, said.

The
 Kaufmans' decision to sail around the world with Lyra and her 
3-year-old sister Cora drew accusations of reckless foolishness from 
some observers and praise from others for their courageous spirit.Â 

'They'll probably go on the 'Today' 
show to talk about this, and write a book about it, do a miniseries and 
get 15 minutes of fame because that's how our country tends to reward 
people who choose recklessly to put themselves and their children in 
danger,' said Margaret Dilloway, a San Diego novelist who has three children.

English doesn't question the decision of her sister's family. She said sailing is their passion. It's what defines them.

'Charlotte and Eric raise their children how they see fit,' English said. 'They
 are very concerned about child safety. That's their No. 1 concern, and 
they did not do this blindly. They are responsible, good parents.'

But
 they are aware of the criticism. Eric Kaufman, a Coast Guard-licensed 
captain, and his wife sent a statement from the ship defending their 
actions, saying 'when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, 
we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any 
sailing crew could.'

Others 
said children benefit in many intangible ways from parents who show them
 the world, even when they're too young to remember it.

Ivan Alba said the Kaufmans should be commended.

'I
 think it's a great thing, their decision to sail around the world, and 
just because their children are 1 and 3 years old doesn't mean they 
can't be on a boat,' said Alba, of San Diego, who is also planning a 
world trip with his wife and two daughters, 8 and 10. 'It's just too bad
 what happened, but that's also life. Anything can happen, anywhere.'

Four
 California Air National Guard members parachuted to the sailboat 
Thursday and stabilized Lyra, who responded well to medication for 
Salmonella-like symptoms until the warship arrived Sunday.

She
 had previously had salmonella in Mexico, where the family had stopped 
their voyage for her birth, but her pediatrician assured them she was 
recovered and could travel, English said.

But shortly into the trip, the child started showing symptoms and did not respond to antibiotics.
