The first picture of Facebook founding president Sean Parker with his new bride, singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas, has been released.

Photographed in the story-book forest surroundings of Big Sur, California, the $10 million wedding took place in front of 300 friends and family members and the theme has been compared by many to the HBO show, 'Game of Thrones'.

Looking every inch the happy couple, 
the Internet entrepreneur who is estimated to be worth $2 billion is now
 officially hitched to the mother of his young daughter after his 
wedding at the swanky Ventana Inn & Spa.

The ceremony and reception featured 
opulent decorations including a ruin, a waterfall and long feast style tables. 

'Forget
 what you heard about Sean Parker's wedding,' friend John Perry Barlow 
tweeted following the ceremony. 'It [was] elegant, tasteful, and 
magical.'

They 'have just been enormously generous to their friends. We are all very grateful', he wrote.

The bride, 24, wore a dress that appears similar to Daenerys Targaryen from the hit HBO show.

Parker, 33, is believed to have 
shelled out $10 million to turn a boutique hotel into what looks like a 
movie set, equipped with outfits for 
guests designed by the costume designer for the Lord of the Rings 
movies.

One source told the New York Post
 that guests 'entered down a long trail and came to a big gate and 
entered this other world in a forest there'... They made the forest come
 alive.'

The ceremony was officiated by Unitarian Universalist minister John A. Buehrens.

The extensive guest list included Sting and his wife Trudie,
 Allison Williams, Emma Watson, Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl, 
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, Perry and Etty Farrell and Lucian Grainge.

Jacqueline Laurita, from the Real Housewives of New Jersey, also attended the event and shared photographs of the lavish hotel on Twitter.

'Words can not even describe how beautiful the wedding I went to yesterday was,' she gushed. 'Nothing like I've ever seen. I felt like I was in a fairy [tale].'

The political world was represented by 
California Attorney General Kamela Harris, Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom and 
Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

Lenas' gown was by Elie Saab, while Parker, 33, the couple's infant 
daughter Winter Victoria and the guests were dressed by Academy 
Award-winning costume designer Ngila Dickson.

Designer Ken Fulk, caterer Paula 
LeDuc 
and designer Preston Bailey, who designed the flowers, all helped 
coordinate the massive affair. Mark Seliger was the photographer.

Guests enjoyed cake from Perfect Endings as well as music by Loreena McKennitt and The Good The Bad and The Ginger.

Parker
 had previously denied the Game of Thrones theme on his Twitter account,
 but admitted they would be instructing guests on what to wear.

'Just
 because we don't trust our guests to dress themselves properly doesn't 
mean we want them to look like #GoT characters,' he wrote in April.

'Academy
 award winning costume designer Ngila Dickson is creating gorgeous, 
inspiring, and unique designs that are both modern and whimsical.'

He hired a landscaping company to 
build fake ruins, waterfalls, man made ponds, bridges and a gated 
cottage in the surrounding woods at the hotel, sources told TMZ in 
April.

The venue included two terraces that 
are used for weddings, that offer 'privacy and an uninterrupted 50-mile 
view of the Big Sur coastline to the south,' according to its website. 

The Inn boasts its design is mean to 'complement nature and encourage guests to experience the essence of romance.'

Residents in the California community have been less than thrilled with the attention Parker's spectacle has attracted.

The California Coastal Commission 
reportedly was called in to investigate whether the inn had procured the
 proper permits for the wedding-related construction, the  San Jose Mercury News reported.

'We're
 pretty used to celebrities being in Big Sur. But for this one, they've 
basically built a movie set to have their wedding,' Stan Russell, head of the city's chamber of commerce, told the paper.

Russell said the construction will go
 away after the Saturday bash and expects the attention the town 
receives could actually help the wedding industry in the city.

'The
 wedding planners in Big Sur are planning ahead for 2014 already, 
because they're booked. People want to come and see what all of the 
excitement's about,' Russell said.

Guests were expected to enter through a $600,000 gate, 
dance on a $350,000 floor and walk past more than $1 million worth of 
plants and flowers, the gossip website site.

The New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls.

'There is a chance the wedding could end up looking like an episode of Game of Thrones,' an insider told the Post.

Game of Thrones is a popular Medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery.

Parker
 is worth an estimated $2 billion after becoming the founder of Napster 
and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark 
Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network.

The internet 
guru is most famous for his portrayal in the movie Social Network, which
 details the role he played in the beginnings of Facebook. Justin Timberlake played him in the Oscar-winning movie.

Parker proposed to Lenas, a 
singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's 
daughter, Winter Victoria Parker.
