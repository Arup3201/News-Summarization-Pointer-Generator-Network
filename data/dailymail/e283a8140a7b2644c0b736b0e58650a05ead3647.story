The body of a man presumed to be a flood victim was found Sunday on a sand bar in New Mexico may be an elderly Arizona man who went missing earlier this week.

Howard Bassett, 83, was the only person reported missing in the area around Mogollon, NM., and hasn't been seen since leaving the inn he was staying at with family despite dire flood warnings. He has not been seen or heard from since.

Authorities had held out hope after finding his Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck Wednesday in a creek bed not far from the Silver Creek Inn, it was reportedly covered in mud and silt, according to KASA.

Evacuated Sept 15 from the inn in the tiny, isolated town about 250 miles west of Albuquerque, Mr Bassett never returned to pick up his possessions, hotel staff told local media.

'We were notified by the inn that the flash flood warning went off Saturday at 11 p.m.' Mr Basset's granddaughter Katie Mead told KRQE. 'The innkeeper woke him up to let him know so he could get out.'

With the only road in or out of town completely washed out by the flooding, caused by over eight inches of rain in the area in only a few days, rescue teams were slow to arrive.

Authorities searched for from Tuesday using helicopters, foot patrols and cadaver dogs, according to KOAT.

Ms Mead noted to KRQE that family members have tried calling the octogenarian's  cell phone multiple times without luck.

'So we are not sure if he ever turned the phone on or if the phone was dead,' she said.

Authorities, feeling they had exhausted all resources, had called off 
the search and rescue operation as of Saturday.  Noting that her mother had joined the search for Mr Bassett, Ms Mead said her family 
held out hope of finding the family patriarch alive.

'She's definitely a strong person,' Mead said. 'She just wants to find her dad.'

The body has been sent to the Office of Medical Investigators for indentification, according to KOB. Authorities have not yet confirmed if the body found y a hiker was that of Mr Bassett.
