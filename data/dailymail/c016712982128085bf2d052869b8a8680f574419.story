Sharon Shoesmith, the council boss at the centre of the Baby P scandal, was in court yesterday to support two social workers who say they were unjustly fired after the child’s death.

Maria Ward and Gillie Christou say they were ‘hung out to dry’ by London’s Haringey Council after the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.

Mrs Shoesmith, the council’s then director of children’s services, won her unfair dismissal claim and is due £1million.

Peter was found dead in his bloodied cot in August 2007 after horrific abuse despite being on a council ‘at-risk’ list with 60 visits from social workers, police and health staff in eight months.

Hearing: (L-R) Gillie Christou, Sharon Shoesmith and Maria Ward were three of Baby P's social workers, and say they were unjustly fired

Tragic: Baby P was a 17-month old boy who died in London after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period

His death shocked Britain and led to 
huge reforms in children’s services. Peter’s mother Tracey Connelly, 31,
her sadistic boyfriend Steven Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 
40, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child’s death.

Support: Former children's services boss at Haringey, Sharon Shoesmith, was in the public gallery watching the proceedings

Mrs Shoesmith, 59, has said she 
considered suicide, lives in fear of revenge attacks and is 
‘unemployable’ after losing her £130,000-a-year job.

She sat in the public gallery at the 
Court of Appeal. Miss Ward was Peter’s social worker from February 2007 
until his death. Mrs Christou was her team leader and supervisor.

Karon Monaghan QC, representing both 
women, said Miss Ward had to move home after the scandal. She said: 
‘Miss Ward was advised to disguise herself with members of the public 
calling her a murderer.’

Lord Justice Laws, Lord Justice Elias
and Lord Justice McCombe heard both were ‘junior’ staff and were 
disciplined after the death as there was a period of 12 days when they 
did not know Peter’s whereabouts.

But ‘media and political pressure’ led to a second disciplinary hearing after which the pair were fired for the same reason.

Miss Monaghan said: ‘The fact it might be politically expedient to hang a person out to dry doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.’

The pair’s legal team claim they suffered ‘double jeopardy’ as they faced two misconduct panels for the same allegations.

Bruce Carr QC, for Haringey Council, 
said of the case: ‘A child subject to child protection plan is failed by
his social workers up to the point he died.’

A ruling will be given at a date yet to be fixed.

Mrs Shoesmith sat in the public 
gallery, directly behind her former staff, as the Court of 
Appeal was told they were sacked because of political and media pressure
called for 'heads to roll'.

allowing the little boy's death

Bruce Carr QC representing Haringey 
Council opposed the claim and said it was a case where: ‘A child subject
to child protection plan is failed by his social workers up to the 
point he died.’

He claimed the social workers had ‘ceded control of the child for 12 days and nobody knew where it was.’

A Watford employment tribunal 
concluded in 2010 that the local authority acted reasonably in 
dismissing the pair because of serious failings in their care of the 
toddler.

The women then challenged that ruling
at the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London, but their 
appeals were dismissed in May last year.

The EAT ruled that the employment 
tribunal did not ‘err in law or come to perverse conclusions’ in 
rejecting their claims for unfair dismissal.

The court later reserved its decision. Lord Justice Laws described it as an ‘important and in some ways anxious case’.
