Women will place their faith in all manner of weird and wonderful beauty buys in their quest for eternal youth, and a product that slows the effects of ageing without having to resort to surgery is the holy grail for the image conscious.

However the latest product to hit the market promising a youthful complexion may leave even the most dedicated beauty disciple at a loss for words.

In the same way that you can lift weights to tone up your sagging arms, you can now exercise your facial muscles using a ‘Face Trainer.’

The Face Trainer by no!no! by Radiancy is a new fitness device that applies the principles of resistance training to the muscles on your face

The Face Trainer works to reduce the signs of aging by toning the underlying muscles through a series of exercises

Claiming to offer ‘resistance training’ for facial muscles, the Face Trainer resembles a futuristic-looking balaclava that covers the head and neck.

Ten minutes a day of wearing the contraption while completing a range of ‘exercises’  including The Puppy Dog and The Frog is supposedly enough to tighten sagging skin and ease the signs of ageing.

Made by the company No!No! the Face Trainer fits firmly against the skin to provide resistance and helps muscles build and tone to all 44 bilaterally symmetrical muscles of the face and neck.

91 per cent of the participants who took part in the clinical trials said they would recommend the Face Trainer to a friend- though that may just be to see them pull the funny faces the exercises require

The device comes with detailed instructions of the exercises, which, if done for 10 minutes a day, are meant to help build up the muscles under the face and improve wrinkles

The Face Trainer is the only FDA registered product of its kind, and
the idea is that as the facial muscles become stronger and build they 
become larger, filling out under the skin and giving a fuller look to 
the face.

In clinical trials 71 per cent of users saw an reduction in sagging while 91 per cent of participants said they would recommend the product to a friend.

Just under half of participants (42 per cent) also reported a reduction in both fine and course lines.
