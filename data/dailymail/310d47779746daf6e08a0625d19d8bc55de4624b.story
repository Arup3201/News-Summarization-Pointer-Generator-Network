The shambolic UK Border Agency wrote off £100million in a catalogue of waste during the three years before ministers moved to shut it down, it emerged today.

Home Secretary Theresa May killed the agency off earlier this year, condemning it as a ‘troubled’ organisation dogged by years of catastrophic failure.

Analysis of the UKBA’s accounts reveal it squandered millions on empty buildings, giving money to asylum seekers who were not entitled to it and booking flights for people who were not deported.

The UK Border Agency was broken up after it emerged the backlog of immigration cases would take 24 years to clear

The agency was repeatedly criticised for its failure to get a grip on Britain’s immigration backlog.

Mrs May lost patience in March after it emerged there were 321,726 outstanding cases involving immigrants, which would take until 2037 to clear.

But behind the scenes a string of blunders meant the agency was wasting millions on buildings, plane tickets and compensation.

The agency’s accounts reveal how the money was written off under the heading of 'losses and special payments'.

In 2012-13 the agency wrote off £42.9million, a significant increase on the £25.1million wasted in the year before. In 2010-11, a total of £30.3million was written off.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the agency had been 'troubled' and had a 'closed, secretive and defensive culture'

Amongst the money that was written off in the last three years were:

It included £2.5million in 2012-13 alone 
booking flights for failed asylum seekers who did not leave the country 
because they were granted the right to appeal.

A doomed plan to build an immigration detention centre in Bullingdon, Oxfordshire  wasted £1.7million before being abandoned.

The agency also lost more than £8million after being told projects it ran for refugees failed to meet funding criteria laid down by the European Union.

Some £1.6million was spent renting a building that was not needed while £1.5million was wrongly paid out to staff in payroll errors.

The extraordinary errors were made at a time when UKBA bosses were receiving six-fugure salaries and generous bonuses.

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘The UKBA appears to have been as dysfunctional at managing out money as it policing the borders.

‘It's simply not good enough that taxpayers' money has been wasted in this manner. The officials responsible should be held to account, not eased into another cushy roll where they can waste money yet again.’

UKBA was set up under Labour in 2008. It was first split almost two years ago, when passport checks and customs were hived off into a new Border Force after officials were found to have downgraded border checks used to spot terrorists.

In March Mrs May announced it would be cut into two parts, one to deal with visa applications and backlogs and the other to track illegal migrants.

In a damning assessment of its failings, she told MPs: ‘The agency has been a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008 and its performance is not good enough.’

Responding to the revelations of waste, a Home Office spokesperson said: ‘The government is determined to build an immigration system that the public can have confidence in.

'We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010.

‘The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. This is why we split the Agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates.’

The UKBA was created in 2008 to replace the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in the Home Office, a department which was already in chaos, with asylum claims piling up, and staff badly demoralised.

It emerged some 450,000 asylum cases had not been dealt with but left in boxes at the Home Office.

The shake-up that led to the creation of UKBA was meant to clear up the mess and stop similar scandals happening in future.

But history repeated itself: Nearly 400 of the 1,000 foreign prisoners were told they could stay in Britain and dozens remained untraced.

More than 100,000 of the 400,000 asylum seekers were allowed to stay, which MPs said in effect amounted to an ‘amnesty’.

Around 500,000 Eurostar passengers boarded trains in France and arrived in the UK without being checked against the warnings index of suspected terrorists.

Border security checks were also suspended regularly and applied inconsistently from 2007 onwards.

In February last year, Theresa May hived off the UK Border Force, which is responsible for frontline controls at air, sea and rail ports, from the wider UKBA.

But in November last year, John Vine, the independent chief inspector of the UKBA revealed that thousands of immigrants were allowed to stay in the UK without undergoing proper checks because of a mountainous backlog of cases.

At one point 100,000 pieces of post were unopened and some 14,000 applicants had already been refused the right to stay but were still pleading with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to reconsider.

An additional 2,100 cases - shipped in a box from an office in Croydon to Sheffield - were still waiting for an initial decision at the time of the inspection with some dating back a decade.

In a scathing report in March, the Home Affairs Select Committee said it would take the UKBA 24 years to clear through a backlog the size of the population of Iceland of asylum and immigration cases.
