Carl Frampton will have to put his hopes of a money-spinning unification clash on hold, even if he beats world champion Kiko Martinez on Saturday night.

Frampton faces the Spaniard for the second time in front of 16,000 fans at a specially built arena in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter.

But even if he delivers a repeat of his knockout early last year, the Norther Irishman must face mandatory challenger Chris Avalos, rather than the likes of Leo Santa Cruz or Scott Quigg.

American Avalos has teamed up with Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom company and must get his shot at the winner within 90 days. Ironically, Hearn promoted Frampton until they split last year.

But the 27-year-old is firmly focused on winning a world title after two decades in the sport.

‘It’s going to be a dream come true to win the world title. I started this long journey at seven years old and had my ups and downs, so to become a world champion in my 20th year of doing this sport, in a stadium built for myself - it’s what dreams are made of,’ said Frampton.

‘I don’t think you’ve seen the best of me. I’m 27, in the prime of my life but there’s still plenty more to come. I can see and feel the improvements everyday in training and after sparring. The best is definitely yet to come.’

Martinez bounced back from his loss to Frampton in stunning style by stopping the undefeated Colombian Jhonatan Romero, stripping him of his IBF belt.

Frampton, though, isn’t expecting anything different this time around from the 28-year-old Spaniard.

‘I think this is his 35th or 36th fight and every single one of his fights he has boxed the same way. He comes-forward, he’s aggressive and has an exciting style that the crowds like,’ he added, ‘I think our styles clash well and make for a good fight but I don’t see him doing anything different and expect him to come head first, trying to knock me out.

‘But it’s up to me to remain smart and switched on for the twelve rounds and as long as I stay focused there’s only going to be one winner.

‘I’m preparing for a hard, gruelling fight, that may take 12 rounds but no matter what happens I’m going to win. I also know I have the power to knock any super-bantamweight in the world out.

‘So it could be a 12-round points decision or it could be over in the first round. Nevertheless, I’m preparing for a very hard and brutal fight then we can talk about future fights.’
