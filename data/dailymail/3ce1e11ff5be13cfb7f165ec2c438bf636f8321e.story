Ally McCoist has appealed for cool heads and calm in the build up to the first meeting of Rangers and Celtic since 2012.

The fierce Glasgow rivals will face each other in the semi-finals of the League Cup on January 31 or February 1.

Wary of the hype and mayhem which might attach itself to a resumption of hostilities, however, McCoist called for all involved to show restraint.

Rangers boss McCoist has called for calm ahead of the clash as it is still three months away

With emotions still running high following Rangers’ financial collapse, McCoist said: ‘It is only right we make an early appeal for calm.

‘Common sense has to play its part in all of this. I believe there has been a frenzy for this fixture in some quarters. I understand that, I get it. But from a sanity point of view we are talking about a game that’s still three months away.

‘It’s the first Old Firm game in almost three years and I hope all the fans can come along and enjoy. But let’s remember we have a duty and a responsibility here.’

McCoist was involved in a touchline clash with Neil Lennon during the so-called ‘shame game’ in 2011 which prompted a Scottish Government summit.

Aware the behaviour of players, management and supporters will be closely scrutinised after a two and a half year hiatus, he added: ‘We should look forward to the occasion.

‘We have missed these matches and all eyes will be on us once again. We must remember we have a responsibilty to conduct ourselves in the proper manner. We all want to win but also to ensure it’s an occasion and a match to remember.’

Reacting to reports Celtic players loudly cheered the draw on Saturday, he claimed the response of his own players was more sombre.

‘Unlike the Celtic dressing room there was no hollering when it was made,’ he said. ‘There was a quiet nod of the head from some. That will do for me.

‘I said: “Great lads, that’s the draw and that’s who we are getting but we’ve got Cowdenbeath on Tuesday.” They all nodded in agreement.

‘With all due respect to everyone involved in this game, I have more Old Firm experience than anyone at the two clubs. We’ll keep our feet on the ground, I will ensure that.

‘Nothing in the next three months will surprise me or shock me. You don’t need to tell me or my players what this game means.

‘I’m fortunate to have the likes of McCulloch, Miller and Boyd. These boys have been over the course. I looked at the three of them when the draw was made. There was no hooping or hollering or high-fiving.’

He expressed some sympathy for League Cup holders Aberdeen and Dundee United, whose last-four clash will be underplayed as a result.

‘Listen, 99.9 per cent of the public wanted to see this game.’ said McCoist. ‘I also understand the Aberdeen and Dundee United players having their noses out of joint because of the interest that will surround our game.

‘Everybody is talking about the Old Firm game. But I have to sympathise with the two clubs Ronny (Deila) has said are better than us. They have a game to look forward to as well but that fixture has been overshadowed.’
