A couple has been awarded £4,200 after contracting gastroenteritis whilst holidaying at Al Diwan Resort, Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt.

Barry Stuart Lawton and his partner, Cheryl O'Brien, had travelled for a two-week holiday to Egypt for a 'recuperating' holiday after Cheryl had suffered two miscarriages.

But, just half way into their holiday, booked with Olympic Holidays, Mr Lawton and Miss O'Brien began to experience nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting.

Barry Stuart Lawton and partner Cheryl O'Brien have been awarded £4,200 in compensation after their 'recuperating' holiday to Sharm El Sheikh turned into a nightmare

Mr Lawton witnessed flies on food being served in the restaurant, bugs in cakes, dirty plates, cutlery and cups and hot plate lids stained with pre-existing food.

Hot food was allegedly left to go cold and Mr Lawton said there was cross-contamination of meat on the cheese platter.

Mr Lawton complained to the hotel representative who suggested medical advice be obtained from the local pharmacist.

Regrettably, the couple's illnesses continued to persist up to four weeks after the initial symptoms began. 

After consulting with their GP on return home, it was confirmed they had both contracted gastroenteritis – an inflammation of the intestines commonly caused by viral, bacterial or parasitic infections.

Mr Lawton claims he 'repeatedly saw staff walking into the kitchen while smoking and chefs' uniforms were dirty and stained'.

He said: 'The barbeque area was covered with food and fat that then attracted flies and had not been cleaned since the previous night.'

Following their complaints, Mr Lawton and Miss O'Brien, who live in Upper Gillingham, Kent, were later moved to a three-star hotel nearby. 

Mr Lawton added: 'When we arrived at the Falcon Nama Star, I thought I had walked into a five-star hotel and not a three-star.

'I couldn't believe the difference between the two considering they had the same star rating.'

Head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors, Anne Thomson, added: 'I am very pleased we were able to obtain compensation for Mr Lawton and Miss O'Brien.

'The most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis is food poisoning so it is imperative that all-inclusive resorts maintain high hygiene standards for their guests otherwise outbreaks of illness will continue to occur.'

The couple, on arrival back home, found out Cheryl was pregnant and they now have a 17 month old beautiful little girl named Beth. They have since married too.
