Olive oil may be good for your heart – but it could soon be taking quite a toll on your wallet.

Prices are set to soar because of poor harvests in Spain, where hot, dry weather affected trees during the flowering season.

Bottlers are paying up to 40 per cent more for their oil than in May, trade magazine The Grocer said.

Industry experts fear Spain's olive oil crop for 2014-2015 could be half the size of last year’s bumper harvest  because of hot and dry conditions

Industry experts fear the country’s crop for 2014-2015 could be half the size of last year’s bumper harvest.

Olive oil has gained hugely in popularity as health-conscious families switch to Mediterranean diets.

Commodity analysts Mintec said it was too early to assess what the full impact would be.  

But one supplier told The Grocer: ‘Currently it is very difficult to purchase wholesale bulk olive oil in Spain as producers are withholding stock in anticipation of higher prices later in the year.’

Supplies of olive oil in Italy have also been greatly reduced by hostile bacteria destroying trees. 

The microbe, first identified in the Americas and never before seen in Europe, had infected 800,000 trees in Salento, in Puglia in, southern Italy, it was reported last month. 

Puglia produces about 11million tonnes of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop and some of the country's best oils.

By mid-August the disease, Xylella fastidiosa, had cost the olive oil industry an estimated £200m.
