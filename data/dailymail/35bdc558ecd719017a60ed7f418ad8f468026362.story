A tourist visiting Disneyland in California had a lucky escape after a rain-sodden section of hotel roof collapsed on her bed while she was asleep. 

The un-named woman was in the Anaheim Alamo Hotel when a section of the ceiling fell onto her bed. 

According to eyewitnesses, the woman suffered facial wounds and was bleeding from her mouth. She was taken away to hospital by ambulance.

Paulo Ang, pictured, from Birbeck, California said the ceiling collapse was 'a very scary situation' 

The victim was visiting California from Vancouver in Canada for a trip to Disneyland. 

Paolo Ang from Birbeck, California said: 'We were sleeping and I heard a noise, like a huge bang. It was like someone had just dropped over from the bed. 

'It was really loud and the daughter's mom came over to our room and knocked on the door and we saw that her chin was like badly bruised. It was a scary situation.'

Anaheim Fire Department attended the scene after the roof collapsed around 2am yesterday.  

The woman was taken to UCI Medical Center for treatment. 

It is understood that the hotel roof had become waterlogged after two days of heavy storms in Southern California. 

The water seeped through the outer layers of the roof and soaked the dry-lining beneath. 

After several hours, a section of the ceiling failed and fell without warning on the bed below. 

Footage from the scene shows a section of ceiling about four feet wide and three feet long failed during the storm.  

Anaheim Police Lieutenant Bob Dunn told Metro: 'It is very unusual. It doesn’t rain much here in California so we don’t have instances like this occurring frequently.' 

The ceiling collapsed at the Alamo Inn in Anaheim, California  in the early hours of Wednesday morning

California has been subjected to some unusual storms over the past week causing significant problems
