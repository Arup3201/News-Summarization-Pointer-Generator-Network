Frank Lampard has revealed that he rejected an offer from his uncle Harry Redknapp to join QPR before deciding to sign for New York City.

Lampard was unveiled in Brooklyn on Thursday after it was confirmed that the former Chelsea midfielder has agreed a two-year deal to play for the Manchester City owned club in Major League Soccer next season.

But the 36-year-old admitted that he and his father Frank Snr spoke with QPR boss Redknapp – who gave him a first-team break at West Ham in 1996 – about staying in the Premier League after he left Stamford Bridge at the end of last season.

‘We had some conversations and so did my dad,’ said Lampard. ‘I think my dad spoke to Harry quite a lot. But it wasn't really an option for me.

‘I had 13 years at Chelsea and it's something very dear to me, so it would have been difficult to play for a club so close. From that point of view coming out here to New York is a good option. It's a new start.

‘I was aware before the World Cup that I was leaving Chelsea. I had a decision to make and I didn't want to make it during the World Cup, even though I was thinking about my future.

‘I’ve only made the decision very recently but I've been handed something which is an outstanding opportunity.

‘There were other options, yes. Some in England, other parts of the world but this was the one that always stood out to me. The idea of coming to this city and playing for a new team with a really good vision for the future, it just made it easy for me. It wasn't a hard decision.’

Lampard will team up with David Villa at New York next season but is unlikely to follow the Spanish star to City’s other sister team, Melbourne, to stay fit in the meantime.

It is unclear where the England midfielder will train before pre-season begins in January, but he is determined to be ready for the new challenge.

‘I really don't know but I will have to keep fit,’ said Lampard. ‘I'll have to train at the very top level, whether that's on my own or with a club somewhere. I'll have to see.

‘Pre-season here will start mid to late January and that will soon come around. I've had time out of football with injury before – three or four months sometimes and it's not that long.

‘In the meantime of course I'll keep fit and make sure my levels don't drop too much. When we come here for pre-season I want to be ready to go. I want to fly out of the blocks. I don't want to come out sluggish.’

Lampard is certain there will be an increasing trend of top players moving to MLS, and believes his old Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will approve of his decision.

‘Absolutely, the quality has grown and there are players from England and players from all around the world coming here,’ he added.

‘There are new clubs springing up like this one. Players like David Villa are coming in. You're hearing names linked with clubs here all the time and it's a very attractive option for players to come and play here.

‘I haven't spoken to Jose that much about it but he'll understand why I've done it. He loves coming out here for pre-season. Maybe he'll come out and have a game against us, he'd get that for sure.

‘But this was a decision for me to take, nobody else. And I know it's the right one. I'm sure Jose will respect my decision. He'll support me no matter what. Wherever I'm playing we'll always be close. Even if we're far away, I'll still admire him and support Chelsea.’
