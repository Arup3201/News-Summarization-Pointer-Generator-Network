Theo Walcott has admitted he grew up fearing Gareth Bale during their time at Southampton - but more for his off-the-pitch activities rather than anything he did on the training field.

The duo often roomed together when coming through the Saints' famed youth system and Walcott revealed that Bale was always trying to play pranks on him.

'I roomed with Gareth and shared digs with him right up to the day I moved to Arsenal,' Walcott said.

'He was good company but you were always grateful to if you got back to your room unscathed when Gareth was around as he was a bit of a prankster.

'I had to be wary. He would do stunts like putting water on top of your door to try and soak you as you walked in, and silly things like that.'

Walcott also revealed he had the option to join Chelsea when he was a youngster, but rejected the chance because he found Stamford Bridge 'daunting', and chose to move to the south coast instead.

Walcott turned down the opportunity to join Chelsea as youngster, preferring Southampton's 'family nature'

'It was the family nature of Southampton that made me turn down Chelsea as a kid,' Walcott said. 'Stamford Bridge was daunting.' 

Walcott could make his first start for Arsenal since January at Swansea on Sunday. He tore a ligament in an FA Cup tie at Tottenham at the start of the year and has only just returned.

Theo Walcott was interviewed for a new book entitled ‘Southampton Match of My Life’ where 18 former Saints players detail their favourite game for the club and the never-before-told stories behind it.
