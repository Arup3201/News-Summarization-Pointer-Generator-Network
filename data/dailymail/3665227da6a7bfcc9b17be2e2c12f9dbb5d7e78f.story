Model Denise Bidot, 28, is changing the face of fashion, one runway show at a time.

The size-14 beauty, who grew up in Miami and now lives in New York City, recently graced New York City Fashion Week catwalks for Chromat and Serena Williams Signature Statement Collection - both of which are not historically 'plus-size' brands.

'The reaction from the Serena Williams runway show was breathtaking,' she told MailOnline. 'And having everyone clap when I came out was surreal.'

Beautiful! Size-14 model Denise Bidot opened the Chromat runway show during New York Fashion Week earlier this month 

Urban chic! Ms Bidot was the only fuller-figured model to walk in Serena Williams' runway show, which was attended by Anna Wintour. She received applause after her walk

Miss Bidot, who is Puerto Rican/Kuwaiti, was the only fuller-figured model in the Serena Williams show. Attendees for the show included Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, actor Marlon Wayans, and tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.

'I never expected to have the leading lady of fashion clap for me and support my presence at the show,' she said. 

'It was an experience I will never forget. I felt the love from the moment I walked in from Serena and her team.'

In the show, Ms Bidot wore a slim-fitting, above-the-knee black dress with an asymmetrical zipper and mesh three-quarter-length sleeves. 

At Chromat, the brand known for dressing Beyonce for her performance at the Super Bowl last year, Miss Bidot's curves were flaunted and flattered even more as she opened the show. 

She walked in a risque, cage-style ensemble with a cropped, strapless, corset-like top. Her hair was pulled into a tight bun with a braid coming down the side.

Following both shows, fans immediately started posting to social media to show support for Miss Bidot.

Twitter user ‏@NYCDR3AMZ wrote: 'Thanks for making plus size women feel more confident in themselves that they CAN walk that walk and talk that talk.'

Another woman, @Khristina2334 said: 'Thank you for breaking barriers, and representing women of all sizes! One of my fav.moments!!'

After New York Fashion Week, Miss Bidot was flown to the U.K. for the Evan show at London Fashion Week. 

Besides being a runway model, Miss Bidot has also starred in campaigns for Forever21, Macy's, Nordstrom and Old Navy. She is currently the face of Zizzi, a Danish clothing line for women with curves.

Stunning! Miss Bidot, who's 28, grew up in Miami before moving to Los Angeles to pursue acting 

Size is just a number! Ms Bidot was doing someone else's makeup during a fashion shoot when a photographer spotted her and asked if she'd be interested in pursuing modeling herself

Miss Bidot's entrance into modeling came rather late by industry standards - and she initially thought she wanted to be a actress (an aspiration she is still pursuing).

When she turned 18, she moved from Miami to Los Angeles - but was turned down by so many casting directors that she decided she needed a backup plan, according to the bio on her website. 

She enrolled in courses to learn how to be a makeup artist. One day, while she was doing makeup for a shoot, a photographer asked her if she'd ever considered modeling herself. The photographer took pictures of Miss Bidot and posted them to a well-known modeling bulletin board, where they got hundreds of responses. 

She was then pursued by clients who wanted her to model for their brand, and also got picked up by a modeling agency, Muse Models based in New York.

Miss Bidot is happy that she inspires so many women - and hopes that her shape doesn't remain an anomaly in an industry typically marked by rail-thin women. 

'Honestly, I have always been a confident person and true to who I am,' she said. 'My amazing mother and grandparents raised me to fall in love with me and accept myself as no one else will. If you share that confident energy with those around you then everyone else will catch on.'
