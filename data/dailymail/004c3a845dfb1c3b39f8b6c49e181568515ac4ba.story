Logan Bledsoe, 8, went to Monday night's Phoenix Suns basketball match thinking he would see a great game. What he got was an awesome surprise: His father, a U.S. Army soldier deployed to Afghanistan, met him on center court.

During a 'contest' at the game, Bledsoe was blindfolded and then lead to center court at the US Airways Center. When he got there and removed the blindfold stood his dad, Specialist Jamie Bledsoe of the California National Guard

Father and son immediately embraced, with Logan brought to tears at the surprise.

'How ya doin’' Mr. Bledsoe said as he embraced Logan. He then picked up his son and they gave each other a huge hug.

The moment led to a standing ovation from the crowd as many fans shed tears at the emotional reunion. Mr. Bledsoe has been serving in Afghanistan for nine months.

'It’s been really hard, just to live by myself with my mom, grandma and grandpa,' Logan told KTVK.

While his father has been serving abroad, Logan had chatted with his dad as often as possible through Skype.

Mr. Bledsoe said he was somewhat surprised at how emotional his son got after seeing him.

'I feel great,' Bledsoe said. 'I didn’t expect that much of a reaction from him ... It was more than I thought it would be.'

The reunion was made possible by the Phoenix Suns and the Streets of New York, a local pizza chain that sponsors the 'Welcome Home Hero' campaign.
