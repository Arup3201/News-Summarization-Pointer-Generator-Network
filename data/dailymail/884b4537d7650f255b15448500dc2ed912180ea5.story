Buckingham Palace is employing hundreds of staff on controversial ‘zero-hour’ contracts, it was revealed yesterday.

Around 350 temporary employees are given no guaranteed income under the deal, and cannot work elsewhere without permission.

Use of the contracts has become widespread despite calls for them to be banned. It has emerged that employees at other national institutions – including cafe workers at the Tate art galleries and 3,700 staff at the National Trust – are also on the deals, meaning that workers at many of Britain’s grandest stately homes are not guaranteed a single hour’s paid employment.

Exhibition: This year Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Dress and Robe will be shown to the public to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Her Majesty's Coronation

The contracts have proved popular with
 employers as they do not set a minimum number of hours that have to be 
worked, allowing firms to draft in extra staff at short notice during 
busy periods.

But trade unions have warned that some
 employers have used them to deny basic rights to workers.

Those 
employed under the contracts say they do not know if or when they will 
be working from one week to the next, making family and childcare 
commitments impossible.

Buckingham Palace uses the contracts for temporary staff working in its shop and the State Rooms during the summer.

A spokesman for the Royal Collection 
Trust, which employs the temporary workforce, denied that the deal 
equated to a zero-hour contract.

She conceded that employees were not 
guaranteed work but said rotas were issued around a month in advance, 
meaning workers could plan around their hours.

A copy of a staff contract from 2009 
stated: ‘Your hours of work will be advised by the visitor manager and 
will be dependent upon the requirements for retail assistants at 
Buckingham Palace as and when required.’

The Palace argues that because staff 
receive advance notice of their working hours and benefits, including 
free lunches and holiday pay, they are not on zero-hour deals.

Those 
working for longer than three months are eligible for sick pay, with 
pension entitlements starting after six months.

Argument: The Palace, which has some buildings and grounds open each summer, said today these are not zero-hours deals although there are not hours set out on the contracts

At the National Trust, the majority of
 seasonal staff are employed on zero-hour contracts. A spokesman said 
they were offered the same job security, pay and benefits as any other 
employee who had worked the same amount of time for the trust and 
managers are urged to set rotas well in advance.

‘Our properties have told us it is 
important to be able to reorganise rotas quickly to respond to the 
weather and zero-hour contracts allow us to do that,’ he said.

Uncertainty: Some 90 per cent of workers at 396 stores are now on zero-hour contracts with the company

Catering staff at the Tate galleries 
in London, Liverpool and St Ives in Cornwall are on similar deals. A 
spokesman for Tate Enterprises Ltd said it did not prevent the 
contracted employees from working elsewhere.

Earlier this week it was revealed that
 20,000 staff at Sports Direct, which is controlled by founder Mike 
Ashley, were also employed under the same practice.

The Government is reviewing their use. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said they could ‘cause intense anxiety and insecurity’.
