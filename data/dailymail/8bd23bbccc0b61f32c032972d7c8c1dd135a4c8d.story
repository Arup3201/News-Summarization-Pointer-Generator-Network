Tsunamis - the devastatingly huge waves caused by underwater earthquakes - are usually associated with coastlines of Japan or the Indian Ocean.

But new research proves that massive tidal waves sparked by seismic activity have also ravaged European shores in the past - and could be repeated.

Scientists from the University of Portsmouth found geological evidence that tsunami waves have swept over Malta's coastline - rising to up to 20 metres above sea level in some places.

The beaches of Malta are popular with tourists - but scientists have warned the area could witness a tsunami

They identified 70-ton boulders inland that had been picked up from the seabed before being carried along by the huge waves and dumped far inland.

Studies of neighbouring coastlines show there has been a major tsunami, on average, every 400 years, thought to be linked to earthquakes beneath Mount Etna in Sicily, Italy.

Scientist Professor Derek Mottershead said: 'It appears that no event of the magnitude indicted by the new evidence has occurred within the past 300 years and so there is no historical memory of any such devastating event.'

But, he added: 'It is highly likely that there have been other equally devastating waves previously and that there will be more in the future.'

The north-east coast is now Malta's most densely populated region and if a similar sized wave struck today, it could threaten thousands of people, experts are warning.

Many residents and holidaymakers live by or visit the north-eastern coasts, where the towns are built right up to the edge of the shoreline.

Lead scientist Dr Malcolm Bray said: 'The most important thing we can do is to educate people about the risk and give the Maltese government the evidence needed to prepare and protect residents and holidaymakers.

'However, if a repeat tsunami occurred now, the risks are high. In the light of these recent findings it now appears that Malta would benefit from a re-evaluation of the tsunami threat

'If people feel an earthquake, they need to know that there is a risk of a tsunami, and if they see the sea recede they should know to get to higher ground.

'Fortunately in Malta, higher ground is never far away, but people do need to be made aware of the risks.'

It is thought earthquakes linked to the Mount Etna volcanoes (pictured) have caused tidal waves in the past
