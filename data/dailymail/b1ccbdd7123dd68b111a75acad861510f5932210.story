Retiring judge Mary Jane Mowat, 66, said the rape conviction rate would not improve 'until women stop getting so drunk'

A top female judge has criticised rape victims who drink too much and are unable to remember their attack clearly.

In a controversial interview to mark her retirement, Judge Mary Jane Mowat said the rape conviction rate would not improve until women stop drinking so heavily.

She also branded the automatic release of prisoners halfway through their sentences as ‘the biggest fraud on the public ever’.

Judge Mowat admitted she expected to be ‘pilloried’ for linking drunkenness with rape, and last night her views were branded ‘outrageous, misguided and dangerous’ by campaigners.

During 18 years as a circuit judge in Oxford – where the rape conviction rate is well below the national average – the 66-year-old has on occasion attracted criticism for her handling of sex offence cases.

In one, she spared a former Guardsman jail for having sex with a 13-year-old girl after saying the teenager had ‘made most of the running’.

The Oxford-educated judge claimed the national rape conviction rate after trial of just 60 per cent is largely due to the lack of corroborative evidence.

‘It is an inevitable fact of it being one person’s word against another and the burden of proof being that you have to be sure before you convict,’ she said.

‘I will also say, and I will be pilloried for saying so, but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk. 

‘I’m not saying it’s right to rape a drunken woman, I’m not saying for a moment that it’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman. 

Judge Mowat, who sat at Oxford Crown Court, pictured, during her 18 years as a circuit judge, told the Oxford Mail that she sat in back-to-back rape trials where the victim was too drunk to remember what had happened

‘But a jury in a position where they’ve got a woman who says, “I was absolutely off my head, I can’t really remember what I was doing, I can’t remember what I said, I can’t remember if I consented or not but I know I wouldn’t have done”, I mean when a jury is faced with something like that, how are they supposed to react?’ 

In Oxford, only 24 per cent of rape trials result in conviction, according to the latest figures.

In her interview with the Oxford Mail newspaper, Judge Mowat also condemned the automatic release on licence of prisoners halfway through their sentences as ‘fraud’, saying: ‘You get a three-year sentence and in fact it means only one-and-a-half years. 

‘The public are beginning to wake up to it but it has been happening for years, quietly, without it ever being announced. It has been done to empty the prisons because they just haven’t got enough places in prisons, they are bursting.’

Natalie Brook, service manager at Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre, yesterday slammed the judge’s comments on rape as ‘an outrageous, misguided and frankly dangerous statement to make’.

She said: ‘Rape convictions will improve when those who perpetrate it, who are disproportionately male, stop raping and when society stops blaming women for somehow being complicit in this act of violence.

‘Rape is 100 per cent the fault of the perpetrator.’

Responding to her comments on early prisoner release being ‘fraud’, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Judges and magistrates have a duty to clearly explain in open court how a sentence will be served and the reasons for it being imposed.’
