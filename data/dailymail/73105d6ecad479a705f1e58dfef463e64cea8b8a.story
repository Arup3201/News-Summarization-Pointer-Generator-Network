A dying mother whose final wish is to take her four-year-old daughter to Disney World got some good news this week.

Savannah Cashman Morgan, of Nashville, Tennessee, has stage IV ovarian cancer and, according to doctors, just weeks to live, but thanks to some generous individuals, part of that time will be spent with her daughter Hannah at The Happiest Place On Earth.

Morgan was able to do this thanks to donations received on a Go Fund Me page she set up for the trip.

Dying wish: The mother started a Go Fund Me page to try and raise money to take her daughter Hanna (above with her mom) on a trip to Disney World

The 19-year-old mother has also spent her final weeks composing more than a dozen cards for her daughter, for future birthdays, her graduation, and even her wedding.

'I want her to have something from me in the future when I'm not there so she doesn't think I've abandoned her you know,' she told WKRN.

And little Hannah and her mom both owe a big thanks to an unexpected source for helping them make these Disney World memories happen -- some fraternity brothers from Austin Peay State University.

Lasting memories: Cashman has written out dozens of cards for her daughter's future birthdays, her graduation, and even her wedding

Alphi Phi Alpha President Andrew Montgomery presented Morgan with a check for $1,500 when he heard about her dying wish.

'This hit home to me personally because I have a lot of friends at home and they are having kids,' he said.

Cashman thanked him, and everyone else who donated, on her fundraising page yesterday.

'Wow!!!! We did it! $10,000!!!! Now we just need to get me out of the hospital so I can get down to Disney!,' she wrote. 

'Thank you to EVERYONE involved, no matter how big or how small! You have no idea how much this means to me and Hannah! Thank you, thank you, thank you!'

Helping hand: Fraternity brothers from Austin Peay State University donated $1,500 to the mother

Dreams come true: The 19-year-old mom thanked everyone on her Go Fund Me page for helping her fulfill her wish of taking this trip with Hannah (above)

Time, now, is of the essence.

'I want to do everything I can but my body just can't handle it anymore,' said the mother.

'The cancer is just so widespread there's just really nothing to do.'
