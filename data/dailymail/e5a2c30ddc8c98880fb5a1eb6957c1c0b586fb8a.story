When veteran television presenter Johnny Ball’s friends discovered he had been mugged during a trip to Ukraine, many of them were no doubt anxious to help him out.

After all – as a rather alarming email had informed them – he would be trapped abroad until he found £1,950 to settle his hotel bill.

But if any kind-hearted souls were moved to answer Mr Ball’s desperate plea for funds, then that was very likely to have been the last they ever saw of their money.

The 75-year-old former Strictly contestant appears to have become the latest victim of an internet ‘phishing’ scam – which sees fraudsters hack into people’s email accounts and beg their contacts for emergency aid.

Mr Ball’s friends received an impassioned message from his personal email account on Monday. Entitled ‘Travel Issues’, the missive explained that he had fallen victim to foreign thieves. It said: ‘I made a trip to Kiev, Ukraine and had my bag stolen from me with my passport and personal effects therein.

‘The embassy has just issued me a temporary passport but I have to pay for a ticket and settle my hotel bills with the manager.’

Describing his friends as his ‘last resort and hope’, Mr Ball – or rather his impersonator – continued: ‘I have made contact with my bank but it would take me three to five working days to access funds in my account.

‘The bad news is my flight will be leaving very soon but I am having problems settling the hotel bills and the hotel manager won’t let me leave until I settle the bills.’

The message went on to say: ‘I need your help financially (£1,950) and I promise to make the refund once I get back home.’

Yesterday, internet security experts described the email as a classic online con-trick, known in the industry as a ‘stranded traveller scam’.

Professor Tim Watson, director of the Cyber Security Centre at De Montfort University, said: ‘This particular scam has been going for quite a while now, at least 12 months, and seems to be increasingly popular.

‘It varies depending on which email you get, but is always along similar lines. You get an email from a friend saying they have been robbed abroad, and they need money. If you email it, you will get a response telling you where to transfer the funds.’

He added: ‘There is a community of scammers online who share the most effective email templates.

‘They operate from all over the world, although many certainly seem to be based in Nigeria.

‘Sadly, the scam is surprisingly effective. We are used to looking out for dodgy emails pretending to be from your bank, but not from people we know and trust.’

Another expert advised Mr Ball – who is the father of DJ Zoe Ball and used to present shows such as Play School and Think of a Number – to avoid future attacks by updating his computer’s anti-virus software.

Tony Neate, CEO of internet safety group Get Safe Online, said: ‘He needs to make sure all his systems are up to date.

‘This almost certainly originated from a virus downloaded when he clicked on a website or email.

‘The virus can then read all your email contacts and message them all automatically. These scammers have no morals. They deliberately play on your heartstrings.

‘Mr Ball’s friends may think it is a plausible story, as he is a well-travelled man. It is easy to imagine someone you know lost in a foreign country. With the added sense of urgency, you are even more likely to respond.’

He added: ‘If nobody replied to these emails, they wouldn’t get sent. But unfortunately they catch people out all the time.’

If any answered Mr Ball's plea, they would be unlikely to see money again
