The man who was racially abused by Chelsea supporters on a Paris Metro insists those involved 'must be found, punished and locked up'.

Footage from Tuesday showed Souleymane S, a 33-year-old born in Paris, twice being shoved back on to the platform at Richelieu-Drouot station before a group of Chelsea fans chant: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it.'

Souleymane, withholding his surname, intends to lodge a complaint with the police because the Frenchman feels the culprits 'can not be allowed to get away with it'.

Gary Lineker, presenter and ex footballer: 'Just saw the video of the Chelsea mob's deplorable behaviour and racist chants. Sickening, embarrassing, moronic, disgraceful.'

Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first ever black footballer: 'I watched it and I was in disgust, I was so angry and ashamed. We’ve done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it’s brought it all right back down. I don’t care if it’s the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention Chelsea this will be the response. I can’t believe this has come about.' 

Stan Collymore, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea fans. Save your spite for those on the train, I'm sure you'll want to see them banned from holding season tickets at your club.'

Jason Roberts, pundit and ex footballer: 'I hope that every black Chelsea Player watches that.'

Sepp Blatter, FIFA president: 'I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris. There is no place for racism in football.'

Ian Wright, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea what you gonna do? Your club has been linked to racism for so long! What have you done? Put a couple of signs up in your ground? Those guys on the train remind me of my childhood. Chase you with their mates! But when alone and confronted, I've seen them cry.'  

'I didn't know I was being filmed, speaking about it has now given me the confidence to go and complain to the police,' Souleymane told French newspaper Le Parisien.

'I'm going to try and do it tomorrow (Thursday), if I have the time, because I have to work.

'These people, these English fans, must be found, punished and locked up. They can't be allowed to get away with it.'

The supporters were travelling to Chelsea's Champions League last 16 tie with Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes when their vile chants were filmed at about 7.30pm.

Souleymane lives in the Val-d'Oise department to the north of Paris and was returning home from work when Paul Nolan, a British expat, caught the altercation on camera.

'I wanted to get into the carriage but a group of English fans blocked me and pushed me away,' Souleymane continued.

'I tried to force my way on, I kept trying to get back on. In the scramble, I lost my phone. They told me things in English but I did not really understand the meaning of their words.

'I don't speak a word of English. I understood that they were Chelsea fans, and I made the connection with the PSG match, which was taking place the same evening.

'I also understood that they were attacking me because of the colour of my skin. 

'You know, I live with racism, I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the Metro.

'I stood in front of them for a long time. Someone came up to me afterwards and said I'd been brave to stand up to such people. I think the whole thing lasted about six or seven minutes.' 

The Paris prosecutor's office opened an investigation on Wednesday into 'voluntary racial violence on public transport', which is punishable by up to three years in prison and a £33,000 fine.

Scotland Yard confirmed they would 'examine the footage with a view to seeing if we can apply for football banning orders', while the Metropolitan Police added they would 'assist French authorities'.

Chelsea appealed for witnesses 'to help us with our investigations and to identify those persons involved', and one of the culprits has since been named as 20-year-old Josh Parsons.

A Chelsea spokesman said: 'Such behaviour is abhorrent and has no place in football or society. We will support any criminal action against those involved, and should evidence point to involvement of Chelsea season-ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them, including banning orders.'

The Football Association backed the Barclays Premier League club's position, while UEFA said they were 'appalled' by the footage. 

The clip was met by disgust across football. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Just saw the video of the Chelsea mob's deplorable behaviour and racist chants. Sickening, embarrassing, moronic, disgraceful.' 

Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first ever black footballer, made his debut in 1982, and said: 'I watched it and I was in disgust. I was so angry and ashamed. We've done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it's brought it all right back down.'

Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright added on Twitter: 'Chelsea what you gonna do? Your club has been linked to racism for so long! What have you done? Put a couple of signs up in your ground? Those guys on the train remind me of my childhood. Chase you with their mates! But when alone and confronted, I've seen them cry.'
