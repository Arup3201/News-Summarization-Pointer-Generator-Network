Southampton's Sadio Mane faces disciplinary action from manager Ronald Koeman after arriving late for Sunday’s 2-0 defeat by Liverpool.

Mane was dropped to the bench for turning up 30 minutes after the 1pm meeting time.

‘He was late for the pre-match,’ confirmed Koeman. ‘We have rules, instructions with the players.

‘Everybody can be late one day in the morning, but you can’t be late at 1pm when you have to play against Liverpool.

‘His explanation is between him and me, but he was too late. I can’t and I don’t accept that. If he has to pay a fine, he pays the fine.

‘But the best way to keep the discipline in the team was not to pick him today.’

On a day of frustration for Koeman, the Saints boss felt his side were denied a penalty when Joe Allen blatantly tripped Filip Djuricic in the first half.

Southampton had two other penalty shouts, when Djuricic fell under pressure from Emre Can in the first minute and Dejan Lovren appeared to handle in the box.

‘The first situation is difficult because, if you whistle, it’s a penalty and a red card,’ said Koeman.

‘You have to be sure as a referee to do that. Maybe Djuricic in that moment fell down a bit too easily in the box.

‘The second, there’s no question. I don’t understand the referee there. But OK, humans make mistakes. The handball just before half-time? I don’t know. 

'I have to watch it back, but it’s always difficult with handballs and penalties.

‘I am proud of how we played but in the last few games we have struggled to score and then it’s hard to win games.

‘That’s football, maybe a little bit about the confidence of the players, but the way we played today, the organisation . . . (I am) disappointed about the result but not about the performance.’

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said he had been shocked at the reception ex-Southampton skipper Adam Lallana was given on his return to St Mary’s.

The midfielder, who spent 14 years at Southampton, left for Liverpool last summer and was roundly booed by home fans — as was Lovren, who also left at the end of last season.

Striker Rickie Lambert, an unused Liverpool substitute, was given a better reception. And Rodgers said: ‘Today was always going to be difficult for the likes of Dejan and Adam.

‘I was a bit disappointed for Adam. He was captain here for two years, gave incredible service and could have left a number of times and didn’t. 

'To get the reception he did was disappointing. There was nothing in the match programme referencing his time here.

‘No mention for Lambert as well. Those two guys gave their heart and soul to Southampton and were big supporters of this club. 

'They’ve moved to one of the biggest clubs in the world. Those two guys were wonderful servants.

‘It was a massive decision for them to come to Liverpool. For former servants or players, there’s always appreciation. But nothing here.

‘For me, that’s a wee bit sad. I was thinking of them today looking at the programme before the game.

‘Everything they gave to this club to get them here today, and not a mention.’

In fact, Lallana and Lambert were referenced more than 20 times in the programme.

Rodgers had a different view on Southampton’s penalty appeals, saying: ‘Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don’t.

‘I thought the referee was excellent, but obviously with the pressure he was under from the crowd, especially with them being 1-0 behind, they’re big decisions for him. I thought in the main he got them right.

‘It was an outstanding win for us, very controlled. Of course you have to defend at times, particularly away from home against a very good side, but it’s a wonderful win.’
