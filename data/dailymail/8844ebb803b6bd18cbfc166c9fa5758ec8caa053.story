The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have advertised for a servant to attend to the Royal household when the couple become parents this summer.

And while in days gone by the housekeeper was employed merely to clean and maintain the home, this newly available role demands the fulfillment of extra duties - including those traditionally undertaken by a valet, personal assistant, cook and even a chauffeur.

In a job description more appropriate to Downton Abbey, the assistant at Kensington Palce must polish silverware and glassware, remain loyal, and ensure 'all areas of the residence are cleaned and maintained to a high standard at all times'.

It comes after St James' Palace has consistently stressed the couple prefer to keep their entourage as small as possible, making it clear Kate has no plans to employ a dresser or lady-in-waiting and that the couple largely to do their own cooking and shopping.

It is also thought the couple plan to break with royal tradition by not employing a full-time nanny when their baby is born later this year.

Instead, the successful candidate for the post will undertake various errands, including the preparation of basic meals, in-house laundry, driving, as well as caring and exercising dogs.

The internal job advertisement at Buckingham Palace asks for someone: 'To provide a high standard of housekeeping for TRH (their royal highnesses) The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.'

As reported by the Sunday Express: 'Main duties include: ensuring all areas of the residence are cleaned and maintained to a high standard at all times.

'Caring for and maintaining TRH personal clothing, cleaning silver-ware and glassware and in-house laundry.'

The post-holder must have a valid UK driving licence and 'discretion, loyalty and reliability are paramount'.

The position demands an average of 37 hours a week, to be worked 8.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday - with the flexibility to work more hours if necessary.

A royal insider expressed concerns as to the sheer number of tasks expected to be fulfilled by one person.

The insider told the Sunday Express: 'It is unheard of for one person to be asked to perform so many duties.

'Clearly the Duke and Duchess are going to get their money's worth out of whoever gets the job.

'The advert states that they’ll be required to work extra hours and you can bet your life they will.'

The source said about 15 people have applied for the job so far.

Earlier this month the couple employed their first orderly, seconding a young Fijian-born corporal from the Parachute Regiment.

Kate and William are expected to move into their new family home at Kensington Palace in late summer or early autumn.

About £1 million is being spent 
renovating the lavish four-storey, 20-room Apartment 1A – which comes 
complete with its own private walled garden.

It was formerly lived in by Princess Margaret.  The cost of the renovations will be met by a mix of public grants and contributions from the Royal Family’s own fortune.

The accommodation, which has been uninhabited since the death of the Queen’s sister in 2002, includes a dining room, drawing room, Lord Snowdon’s former study, Princess Margaret’s garden room, extensive staff quarters and a nursery.
