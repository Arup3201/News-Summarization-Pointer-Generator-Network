 

Australians have become more daring in the bedroom, with risque sexual acts practised more frequently and being embraced at younger ages, a new study reveals.

Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life. 

Despite people being more adventurous in their sex life, researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), La Trobe University and the University of Sydney also found that couples are having sex less compared to 10 years ago.

Around 20,000 people aged between 16 and 69 told researchers over the phone that on average they have sex approximately 1.4 times a week, less than 0.4 times than Australians a decade ago.

The younger they were, the more sex they were having but even people in their 60s admitted to engaging in the practice at least once a week.

Professor Juliet Richters, lead researcher from UNSW, said that the frequency of sex among those surveyed came as a shock.

'We thought it was a mistake, but a recent British national survey had the same finding,' Professor Richters told The Age. 

With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Richters suggests the time spent online could be impacting our sex lives.

'I would have thought take a mobile phone to bed might have something to do with it', she said.

Even though people these days are having less sex, nearly 90 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women admit that they are very much enjoying their sexual encounters.

The country's largest study of sexual activity and attitudes  found that over 92 per cent of heterosexual people are having vaginal sex, 86 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women are engaging in oral sex and 25 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women have had anal sex.

Oral and anal sex was more common among 30 to 49 year-olds. 

'We're entering a more exploratory, diverse time,' said Dr Chris Rissel, public health researcher from The University of Sydney.

'I think what we've probably got is a less dramatic change than the 1960s but across a wider range of the population. We've got more exploration, more diversity, across a wider age group.'

Nearly half of the people under 60 also admitted to watching pornography compared to a decade ago. 

Despite this, around 95 per cent of people demand exclusivity in their relationship, The Australian Study of Health and Reproduction revealed.
