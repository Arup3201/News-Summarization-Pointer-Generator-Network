Downing Street last night backed a scathing attack on the internet giants by the new boss of GCHQ.

Number Ten said the Prime Minister shared the concerns of Robert Hannigan, who accused firms such as Twitter and Facebook of turning into ‘the command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists.

Mr Hannigan said some US-based tech firms were ‘in denial’ about how their services were being used by fanatics to facilitate mass murder and said they must do more to help GCHQ, MI5 and MI6.

He highlighted how Islamic State fanatics in particular were using social networking sites to spread their message of poison – sending 40,000 Tweets a day. But, rather than providing more co-operation with the security services, the tech companies have become less helpful in the wake of the revelations about State surveillance by the CIA fugitive Edward Snowden.

The Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) said Mr Hannigan’s comments were ‘wrong’ and ‘ill-judged’. But the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said Mr Cameron ‘very much shares the view that’s being expressed around the use of internet access technologies by violent and extremist groups amongst others, and the need to do more’.

In his article in the Financial Times, Mr Hannigan said the tech firms must understand that mobile technology and smartphones have massively increased the options available to terrorists.

He continued: ‘Techniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous which were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation states now come as standard. These are supplemented by freely-available programs and apps adding extra layers of security, many of them proudly advertising that they are “Snowden approved”.’

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of Westminster’s Intelligence and Security Committee, backed the GCHQ boss – saying some of the technology firms had an ‘amateurish’ approach to monitoring alleged criminal behaviour. He even accused the firms of obstructing security efforts with systems that prevent intelligence agencies from being able to find out lawfully ‘what’s being said from one terrorist source to another’, he told Radio 4’s World At One.

But ISPA Secretary General Nicholas Lansman criticised Mr Hannigan and instead called for a ‘full public debate’ to determine the balance between the right to privacy and need for security.

He added: ‘The internet has opened amazing opportunities for communication and business. To mis-characterise it as a tool for terrorists is short-sighted. Internet companies have and will work with authorities to tackle unlawful activity.

‘Ultimately, the public will be the arbiters of where the line should be drawn between privacy and security. For this to happen an honest and frank debate is required based on the full facts. The opinion piece from GCHQ falls short of this.’

They help our mortal enemies — but couldn’t care less says PROFESSOR ANTHONY GLEES

Historically, senior GCHQ personnel have largely remained in the shadows. But in remarkably robust language, Robert Hannigan, the new director of GCHQ, has warned how the big, mainly American, technology companies such as Google have singularly failed to crack down on the disturbing use of internet sites by terrorists, especially Islamic extremists bent on the destruction of our civilisation.

From my own work in this field, I know Hannigan is absolutely right.

Islamic State fighters are the first terrorist generation of the internet age, and the jihadists are becoming ever more sophisticated in their exploitation of computer technology.

Jihadi John's videos were put on-line

They manage their YouTube videos and craft their Facebook entries to gain maximum impact and to taunt our security agencies every second of every hour. They understand how to get round protective firewalls and spam filters that have been constructed with huge expense and hard work. Incredibly, during their recent advance on Mosul in Iraq, IS agents sent 40,000 tweets a day.

But what is particularly chilling is how western self-styled crusaders for internet freedom, such as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (a former contractor for the US National Security Agency), have ended up helping the jihadists by revealing so much about the methods of British, European and American intelligence agencies.

Snowden leaked details via The Guardian about the extent to which GCHQ could monitor electronically transmitted messages and its capacity to search the vast amounts of data to identify information that might help them defeat terrorists.

Indeed, in a development that perfectly illustrates the extent to which our enemies have been technically assisted by these self-righteous leakers, some programmes and apps with high levels of encryption are now advertised as ‘Snowden-approved’.

Six weeks ago, I wrote in this paper about the enormous harm done to western security by Snowden and Assange. Now we have confirmation from the head of GCHQ about the extent of that damage.

The great danger is that we are at risk as a result of the behaviour of these self-indulgent poseurs who prattle about human rights but care nothing for our genuine freedoms. That is why it is so vital that intelligence agencies are given the tools they need to protect us from our mortal enemies. In practice, that requires the internet giants to face up to their social responsibilities, instead of colluding, however inadvertently, with the jihadists.

Only a few days ago, for example, the Raqqa Media Centre, an activist collective affiliated to IS in Syria, was found to be using Facebook to distribute images of a beheading, accompanied by a message that glorified this atrocity.

In their reluctance to help the security agencies, these internet firms have carried their much-trumpeted scruples about online privacy and freedom to a dangerous excess, thereby enabling the extremists to act with impunity.

Indeed, Apple and Google have arrogantly announced that they have created operating systems that allow people to permanently lock their smartphones. Only the user knows the security code. Apple and Google say they can’t break that code, and nor could they help government agencies unlock phones owned by people suspected of having links to terror or criminal groups, even if compelled to do so by court order.

Similarly, IT companies routinely sell high-tech encryption packages that allow people to surf the web anonymously. Of course, such equipment attracts people who have something to hide.

Bristling with outrage, some of the internet providers seem to enjoy challenging the intelligence agencies. Recently, seven of them – including GreenNet in the UK and the aptly named Chaos Computer Club in Germany – joined forces to take legal action against GCHQ over its attempt to investigate secretive networks on the ‘dark side’ of the web.

This is just part of a formidable nexus, made up of tech companies, internet providers and civil liberties groups, along with supporters of Snowden and Assange, which has joined up to fight attempts by governments to tackle online terrorism. They are supported by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, widely regarded as the founding father of the web, who has said that allowing intelligence agencies to target data held on the internet would be tantamount ‘to the destruction of human rights’.

But it is absolutely vital that we fight this skewed view of freedom.

The irony that the internet providers fail to notice is that we will have no liberty at all if the jihadists triumph.

For its part, I believe, our government has been far too feeble in taking on the companies and dogmatic libertarians, not least because the Conservative Party – keen to burnish its modernising credentials – has strong connections with Silicon Valley. Indeed, Rachel Whetstone, a close friend of David Cameron and married to his ex-policy chief Steve Hilton, is vice-president of Google.

The EU, too, has been equally feeble and deluded, as shown by the appalling decision by the European Court of Justice – in the name of upholding ‘the fundamental right to privacy’ – to let people demand that internet providers remove their personal online records from Google searches.

Far from being a blow for freedom, this showed an Orwellian tendency to rewrite the past to suit wrongdoers.

What’s more, there is another aspect of ministerial hypocrisy.

While the Government shows deference to high-tech giants, despite mounting evidence that they profit from terrorism, it has cracked down on the press – with the Leveson inquiry – although newspapers have done a heroic job in exposing wrongdoing in this country.

The views of the new head of GCHQ should serve as a clarion call for change.

Despite all the phoney outrage from libertarians, Snowden and tech companies, most British people recognise the incontrovertible truth that we can never have freedom without security.
