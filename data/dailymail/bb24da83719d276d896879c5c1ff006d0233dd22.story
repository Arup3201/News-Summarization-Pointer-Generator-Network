Adam Lanza set out on his shooting spree in Newtown, Connecticut, intent on killing people people than Norwegian mass-murderer Ander Breivik, it was claimed today.

A new report says Lanza, 20, targeted Sandy Hook Elementary School because he believed it was the best place for him to shoot as many people as possible and rival the 77 lives claimed by Breivik in 2011.

The details could shed more light on what caused Lanza to kill his mother and then commit a shooting rampage that left 20 first graders and six adults dead on December 14.

Copycat? A new report suggests that Adam Lanza, who killed 27 people, meant to top the number of murders committed by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik in 2011

Young victims: Lanza targeted two first grade classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 people

Similar ends: Breivik also targeted young people. He killed 69 at a youth summer camp organized by the Labor Party. A total of 77 died in his two attacks

CBS News quotes two anonymous officials with inside knowledge of the police investigation as saying Sandy Hook offered the 'easiest target' and the 'largest cluster of people' for him to attack.

The Connecticut State Police dismissed the CBS report as 'pure speculation' and said the assertions about Breivik are not true.

Lanza left no note explaining his motives and smashed his hard drive before for the shooting, leaving few clues about why he killed his mother Nancy Lanza in her bed and then shot his way through the school.

Police believe Lanza may have been playing out a scenario in one of his favorite video games and was obsessed with achieving a higher 'score' than Breivik by killing even more people, according to CBS.

Both Lanza and Breivik men apparently shared a love of the Call of Duty - the realistic combat shooting game and used it as 'training' for the deadly massacres.

Detectives found thousands of dollars worth of video games in a den with darkened windows where Lanza spent hours playing.

Both killers also used American-made .223-caliber assault rifles. Breivik armed himself with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. Lanza used a Bushmaster AR-15.

Devastation: The murders of 20 first graders and six teachers shocked the nation and horrified the quiet community of Newtown

Mother: Nancy Lanza had taken her son to a shooting range for years, and was shot dead by her son with one of her own guns

Breivik, 32 at the time, shocked the world in July 2011 
when he planted a car bomb in downtown Oslo, Norway, and then attacked a
summer camp run by the country's Labor Party.

Eight people died in the bomb blast and 204 were injured. Breivik shot dead 67 people and wounded 33 more.

He was later taken alive by police and said he carried out the attacks to combat socialism and the immigration of Muslims to Norway.

He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, though his prison term can be extended every five years.

Unlike Breivik, Lanza would not be taken alive. He reportedly fired several rounds at police cars as they arrived on the scene.

He then shot himself in the head and was found dead by police who swept through the building.

House of horrors: It is thought that Nancy was planning a move from their house in Newtown, pictured, for Washington state to find a place for Adam to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20-year-old

Along with the video games, Adam 
Lanza also learned how to fire guns during numerous sessions with his 
mother Nancy Lanza at a shooting range, where the two 'bonded, the Hartford Courant
reported on Sunday.

Her landscaper Dan Holmes told the paper: 'She said she took her kids target shooting, that they bonded over that.'

Nancy Lanza was seen as a dedicated
mother to Adam, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and a 
sensory integration disorder - an aversion to bright lights and loud 
noises.

She had enrolled and pulled Adam into 
numerous schools over the years after growing unsatisfied with the 
education he was receiving.

Victims: Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner. Second row: (L-R) Jesse Lewis, Olivia Engel, Josephine Gay, Charlotte Bacon, Chase Kowalski. Third row: (L-R) Daniel Barden, Jack Pinto, Catherine Hubbard, Dylan Hockley, Benjamin Wheeler. Fourth row: (L-R) Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: (L-R) Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza

More victims: Madeline Hsu, six, left, and Allison Wyatt, also six, right, were shot dead on December 14 at their school

She was planning a move to Washington state with the hopes of getting her son back into a college program.

But Adam Lanza also received an education on weapons from his mother, who took him target shooting at a gun range for years.

Richard
Novia, a security chief in the Newtown School system who moderated the 
tech club - of which Adam had been a member - said he disagreed with 
Nancy Lanza's recreation with her son.

He told the Courant: 'It's a serious mistake, first of all. If you have
a child in the home with mental disorders, or learning disabilities, to
have involved him with guns in the first place would be bad.'

Days
after the Sandy Hook shooting, Nancy Lanza's sister-in-law Marsha 
revealed that she had traveled to nine cities in three countries because
she wanted out of the mansion she shared with her troubled son Adam - 
and could have known the end was coming.

It is believed that Nancy - who was 
suffering from multiple sclerosis - wanted to downsize and find a place 
for him to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled
20-year-old.
