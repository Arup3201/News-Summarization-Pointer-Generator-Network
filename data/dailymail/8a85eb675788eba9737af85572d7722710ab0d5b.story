Gary Lineker has claimed it would be a 'national disgrace' if Premier League clubs tried to prevent their players playing for England in this summer's European Under-21 Championship.

England Under-21s twice came from behind to win 3-2 over Germany in a friendly at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium on Monday night.

And former England striker Lineker reckons Gareth Southgate's squad for the tournament in the Czech Republic should include eligible players from the senior squad to give them the best chance of success.

He said on Twitter: 'England's U21's beat Germany. Add a few from the full squad and they could win Euros this summer. Must include all our best youngsters. MUST.

'Tournament football experience is hugely beneficial. If clubs try and pull their players out it would be a national disgrace.

'The PL clubs misunderstanding of the massively positive impact a successful national side would have on the PL has always baffled me.'
