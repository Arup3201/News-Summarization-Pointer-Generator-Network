Wayne Rooney played down moving clear of Jimmy Greaves and into third by himself in the England all-time scoring charts - but admitted he would be 'delighted' to eventually break Sir Bobby Charlton's record.

And on a night when Rooney bagged a brace in the Three Lions' 3-1 victory over rivals Scotland at Celtic Park, Gary Lineker enjoyed having a bit of fun with the England striker.

Lineker - who is second in the scoring charts with 48, one behind Sir Bobby - tweeted throughout the match, joking that it was 'c**p' to be second in the list of England scorers.

But Rooney revealed his delight at scoring his 45th and 46th goals for England - placing him just three behind Charlton.

He told ITV: 'I'm just enjoying my football at the minute. I've always loved playing for England. I hope that continues and if that means beating the record I'll be delighted.' 

And, speaking on Sky Sports, Rooney said: 'I'm just happy to score goals for England and it's a special night for me to score goals at Celtic Park.' 

Yet, when Rooney scored his first goal, former Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur striker Lineker tweeted: 'Yes! Get in there, just 4 to go @WayneRooney. It's c**p being second anyway.'

He then sent out another message after the Three Lions captain got his second: 'Feel Rooney's breath on the back of my neck.'

Finally, Lineker joked that Rooney had now decided to hang up his international boots so he could not move up to second in the charts.

His last tweet read: 'BREAKING NEWS: Wayne Rooney retires from international football.'

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had put the visitors ahead at Celtic Park before Rooney scored a second just after half-time.

Andrew Robertson pulled one back for the Scots but Rooney popped up again to bag his second and England's third of the night to secure the victory.

And England boss Roy Hodgson was impressed by his skipper's contribution.

He told Sky Sports: 'Rooney has to be delighted with his couple of days because he has his 100th cap and now he's scored two and we've beaten Scotland.

'Rooney is important to us as a leader because we have such a young team and he is one of the elder players.'
