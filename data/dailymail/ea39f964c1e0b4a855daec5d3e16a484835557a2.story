A robber attacked an elderly woman after pretending to help her take pictures of her childhood home when she returned with her daughter after 73 years.

Marjorie Ramondetta, 93, and her daughter Linda Reynolds, 65, were allegedly shoved down a flight of stairs in the building by a thug when they came back to the house in Washington Heights in Manhattan, New York.

The man then stole the women's purses as they lay bruised at the bottom of the stairs, law-enforcement sources said.

Victim: Marjorie Ramondetta, 93, was allegedly attacked by a robber in her childhood home

'After we fell, he took the bags,' Mrs Reynolds told The New York Post yesterday. 'I heard my mother say, "Please help me!"

'I ran upstairs, and I’m yelling, "Call the cops! Call 
the cops! Someone help us!"'

Mrs Ramondetta, who hadn’t been back to the building since 1940, said: 'We’ve never had such an upset in our life.'

Mrs Reynolds said they had arrived at the building on Amsterdam Avenue and 164th Street on Tuesday at 12.20pm to snap photos for a family scrapbook.

Mrs Ramondetta was having her picture taken by Mrs Reynolds when the alleged thug — identified as career criminal Richard Davidson — greeted them.

'He said, "Can I help you?" He was clean-cut, clean clothes, clean-shaven. He looked decent,' Mrs Reynolds recalled.

Mrs Reynolds said that Davidson, 25, had asked them if they lived in the building.

Mrs Ramondetta said that 'she was born there and wanted to see what it looked like at present day,' according to a police source.

Davidson then escorted the women to the second-floor apartment, where Mrs Ramondetta once lived, the police source said.

'He [then] says, "I have to get my keys downstairs,"' Mrs Reynolds said. 'He came back up and said, "I’m going to hurt you."'

Davidson then allegedly grabbed for their purses, but the women wouldn’t let go of them.

'I tried to kick him. I don’t know if I kicked him in the legs, but my object was not the legs — if you know what I mean,' Reynolds said.

Davidson then threw both women down approximately ten stairs, Mrs Reynolds said.

Sources said he scooped up their purses and ran away.

The women were treated at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

'I’m in so much pain,' Mrs Reynolds said, showing the bruises on her back and buttocks.

Later that day, Davidson was arrested on an unrelated grand-larceny charge.

While in custody, he is said to have confessed to stealing the purses as well as to a similar case on August 2.

Police later said that Davidson had been arrested later that day trying to get into a cab, according to abc7 Eyewitness News.

Police said he had a crack pipe in his pocket.

He allegedly made two other attacks during the same day - on a 70-year-old woman and a 63-year-old woman who was riding the A train at Harlem.

Davidson has 21 prior arrests dating back to 2008.

'I'm not used to giving up things I work for,' Mrs Ramondetta told Eyewitness News. 'I don't go out advertising it, but this is mine.'

'I want to punch him in the face and I also want his mother and his grandmother to be in the courtroom,' added Mrs Reynolds.

'I want them to see and hear what he did to us.'
