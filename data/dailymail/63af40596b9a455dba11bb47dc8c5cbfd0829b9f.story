A heartwarming video has surfaced showing a flight attendant accepting her pilot boyfriend's proposal some 34,000ft in their air in front of a cabin full of passengers.

Alaska Airlines flight attendant Brandy Hollenbeck's day was going like any other on the flight from Seattle to Juneau when the surprise moment unfolded.

As she tended to the passengers, a familiar voice came over the tannoy as her boyfriend Eric Greener began to detail the moment the two first met.

It was the perfect way to propose for pilot Eric Greener to his flight attendant girlfriend Brand Hollenbeck

Yet seemingly oblivious to this and focused on her job, Brandy continued her duties, pouring out coffee to the passengers.

The Ravn Alaska pilot had sneaked onto the plane unbeknown to Ms Hollenbeck, and waited in the flight deck jump seat to spring his special surprise. 

Speaking to Alaska Airlines' official website, Ms Hollenbeck's close friend and fellow flight attendant RieAnn Fullwood said: 'We tried to keep her busy in the back of the plane during boarding so she wouldn't see (her boyfriend) Eric board.'

Greener took the microphone to tell all on board how he had been told by his mother some time before how she had met a 'wonderful flight attendant while flying out on Alaskan Airlines'.

Mr Greener began by recounting how the couple first met, and described it as love at first sight

He then fast forwards to three months later, when he had come across a 'beautiful flight attendant mowing down on a double cheeseburger'.

He tells the passengers: 'All I could think, folks, is, my gosh, the flight attendant has got the courage to eat a cheeseburger in the terminals is a woman to know.' 

He speaks of how the two 'hit it off' and that he 'got her number' after meeting the woman of his dreams. 

Finally, while serving passengers, the flight attendant realises the love story being told over the tannoy was her very own.

The announcement brought as much surprise to the passengers, as it did to Brandy Hollenbeck

'Brandy Hollenbeck, I've loved you since the first moment I met you, and I want to be the man for you for the rest of your life,' says Greener.

The pilot then springs out of his hiding place, to be greeted by an onrushing Ms Hollenbeck down the aisle, and the two embrace.

The passengers cheer and applaud the loved-up couple, before Mr Greener places a ring on his fiancee and the two share a kiss.

Just in case he wasn't sure, Mr Greener shouts, 'Will you marry me?', to which Ms Hollenbeck answers, 'Yes'.

The final act is set for the delighted fiance who raises one hand in the air exclaiming, 'She said yes.'

Ms Hollenbeck, quoted on the airline's website, added: 'At one point I thought, "Someone up there is telling my love story!" But I just kept serving coffee.'
