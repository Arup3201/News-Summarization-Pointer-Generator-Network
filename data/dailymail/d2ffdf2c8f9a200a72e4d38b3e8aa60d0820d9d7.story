Denial: Prince Andrew's ex Koo Stark appeared at Isleworth Crown Court today and denied stealing a £40,000 painting from an ex-partner's house

The Duke of York’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark today denied stealing a painting worth £40,000 from a former partner.

The 56-year-old, appearing under her real name Kathleen Stark, is accused of snatching the artwork from the flat of her former partner Warren Walker.

The actress and artist is accused of stealing the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting, after a housekeeper let Miss Stark into Mr Walker's home in Kensington Park Gardens, London.

After arriving with a bunch of flowers, 
Miss Stark allegedly demanded a vase before taking another picture off the 
wall and getting into a 'tug of war' over it.

The housekeeper managed to hold onto 
the picture but Miss Stark is said to have run up the staircase and 
grabbed the landscape painting of a moonlit castle before fleeing the property.

During the court appearance, Miss Stark claimed she was injured by a police officer after being arrested following the alleged offence.

American-born Miss Stark dated Prince Andrew after his return from the Falklands in 1982.

They met on a blind date during his leave from the Navy and she was later invited to Balmoral to visit the Royal Family.

The couple dated for 18 months before splitting after she appeared semi-naked in soft porn film, Emily, with the Duke of York going on to marry Sarah Ferguson in 1986.

Accusation: Miss Stark, 56, is accused of stealing a Anthonie van Borssom oil painting from Warren Walker's home in Kensington, London

Exposed: Miss Stark in the 1976 film Emily, which contributed to the public demise of her relationship with Prince Andrew

Miss Stark arrived at Isleworth Crown 
Court wearing a silver-grey dress that matched her hair and spoke only 
to confirm her name and to deny the charge from July 21.

Miss Stark will return to court for her trial on June 17, which is expected to last up to four days.

Mr Walker, whose painting she is accused of stealing, is father of Miss Stark's 15-year-old daughter Tatiana.

The pair have had a tempestuous 
relationship since and she once threatened to sue him for 'emotional 
distress' after he applied for custody of their daughter when she was 
11.

Stark, who is now a photographer, was in a
relationship with Mr Walker until he jilted her 10 days before their 
1997 wedding while she was heavily pregnant.

Lovers: Prince Andrew and Koo Stark in conversation. The pair dated after his return from the Falklands in 1982

Star: Miss Stark also starred in 1975 film The Adolescents where she also appeared in a string of topless scenes

Her lawyer Edward Henry told the court today: 
‘The defence in this case is a claim of right arising out of a most 
troubling, unfortunate and indeed regrettable state of affairs between 
the mother and father of a much loved daughter.’

During the case, Miss Stark claimed she was injured by a police officer as she was arrested two days after the alleged event, claiming there is CCTV footage of the injury.

Her defence counsel, Edward Henry, told the court: 'Most regrettably, when arrested the defendant suffered physical injury. That was documented in the police station and it was also videoed in the police station.'

As well as her career on the big and small screens, Koo Stark also took to the West End to perform in the play 'And Then There Were None' at the Duke of York Theatre in 1988
