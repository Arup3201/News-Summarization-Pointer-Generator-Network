David Cameron last night ordered an inquiry to establish the ‘full facts’ of a vicious spat between two of his most senior Cabinet Ministers.

Simmering tensions between Michael  Gove and Theresa May over Islamist extremism exploded into open warfare late on Tuesday evening.

Mr Gove was given a dressing-down by the Prime Minister for triggering the row – prompting speculation he could be moved in the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle.

There was particular anger that Mr Gove started the damaging spat on the eve of the Queen’s Speech, but senior officials also raised concerns about the ferocity of the attacks on the Education Secretary by allies of Mrs May, which were described as an ‘extraordinary over-reaction’ by one source.

The Prime Minister now wants to know the exact role played by the warring ministers and their special advisers.

In particular, the inquiry is likely to focus on why the Home Office published a letter from Mrs May, that was deeply critical of the Education Department, in the early hours of yesterday.

The letter fanned the flames of the row by suggesting Mr Gove’s department had ignored warnings about the ‘Trojan horse’ infiltration of Birmingham schools by Islamist extremists.

The details of the dispute date back to a meeting of the Government’s extremism task force last November. Mr Gove wanted to broaden the definition of extremism so that more hardline organisations would be covered.

When Mrs May refused, saying the move risked pushing individuals into feeling persecuted and more susceptible to being radicalised, Mr Gove took his case to the Prime Minister.

Earlier this week, after becoming frustrated by his failure to change the Home Office’s position, Mr Gove opted to make the dispute public via a toxic briefing to The Times newspaper.

Over lunch with the paper’s editor, he is understood to have criticised Mrs May and her senior counter- terrorism adviser Charles Farr, who is the architect of anti-extremism policy.

When Mrs May’s aides learned of the briefing, they made a stinging attack on Mr Gove. One said of his department: ‘Lord knows what more they have overlooked on the subject of the protection of kids in state schools. It scares me.’

In the early hours of yesterday, the Home Office made public the letter from Mrs May to Mr Gove, concerning the ongoing investigation into whether Muslim hardliners had tried to seize control of 21 schools in Birmingham.

She wrote: ‘Is it true that Birmingham City Council was warned about these allegations in 2008?

‘Is it true that the Department for Education was warned in 2010? If so, why did nobody act? It is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools.’

As the fight threatened to spiral out of control, Mr Gove was contacted by Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief-of-staff, and ordered to end  hostilities. He was also spoken to by Mr Cameron personally.

Mrs May and Mr Gove issued a joint statement, on the instruction of No 10, promising to work together in future.

Sources say there is irritation in Government that Mr Gove again opted to make an internal dispute public – gifting Labour the opportunity to portray the Tories as divided.

It is the second time in weeks that the Education Secretary has been forced to put on a show of unity after a public spat with a colleague.

Last month the Prime Minister stepped in to defuse a spat between Mr Gove and his Liberal Democrat deputy, David Laws, over free school meals.

Of the latest dispute, one Cabinet source said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks Michael is a very talented minister and when the history books are written, he’ll go down as one of the great education reformers. But this was not seen as helpful.’

If Mr Gove is shifted from Education Secretary, possibly to become Tory chairman, schools minister Elizabeth Truss is tipped as his successor. However, some senior Tories were taken aback at the aggressive nature of the Home Office’s response to Mr Gove’s criticisms.

The highly unusual publication of Mrs May’s barbed letter in the early hours of yesterday morning caused particular surprise.

‘This is internal Cabinet correspondence and the Home Office decides to put it out at 2 o’clock in the morning? I’m afraid it looks like the sort of rush of blood to the head that Theresa May is normally very good at avoiding,’ said one minister.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘For two such senior ministers to launch a vitriolic public blame game in this way is appalling and irresponsible when they should be working together to sort out such serious problems.

‘Too often both Michael Gove and Theresa May resort to public blame games rather than taking any responsibility themselves or working together with others.

‘This is bad government and David Cameron should sort it out.’

There are long-standing differences between Mrs May and Mr Gove over counter-terrorism strategy, and also simmering tensions over the future leadership of the party, with Mr Gove understood to be opposed to Mrs May taking over.

He favoured first Boris Johnson then George Osborne as a so-called ‘Stop Theresa’ candidate.

His blast against Mrs May coincided with polls showing she is the clear favourite to replace Mr Cameron.

In the open: Nick Robinson mentioned the relationship between Charles Farr and Fiona Cunningham (pictured) on the Today programme

BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson  yesterday highlighted a relationship between two of Theresa May’s top advisers – shedding more light on the spat between the Home Office and the Department for Education.

Charles Farr, 54, and Fiona Cunningham, 40, were thrust into the spotlight when Mr Robinson told Radio 4’s Today programme their relationship was a ‘complicating factor’ in the battle between Mrs May and Michael Gove.

Mr Robinson appeared to suggest Miss Cunningham was responsible for anonymous quotes in The Times from a ‘Home Office source’ attacking Mr Gove, who the newspaper said had been ‘particularly critical of Charles Farr’.

Mr Robinson told listeners: ‘The  complicating factor is that Charles Farr is in a relationship with Theresa May’s special adviser [Miss Cunningham] who was behind many of the quotes that are in the newspapers today.

‘So there is a personal element, but let me stress: that’s not the key to this story.’
