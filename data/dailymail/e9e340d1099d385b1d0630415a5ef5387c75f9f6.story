A Labour council has banned pork from primary schools in its area claiming it is too expensive to monitor the diets of Islamic and Jewish pupils. 

Islington Council, in north London, has been slammed by members of the pork industry for taking chops, sausages and bacon off the menu.

But while the local authority admits pork is no longer on the menu, it denies banning the meat - instead claiming pork is simply not provided under its current catering contract.

The council has removed pork from all primary school lunches despite the fact it is still being served in Islington's secondary schools.

An Islington Council spokesman said today: 'It's not true that pork is banned in our primary schools. 

'It is not currently provided in our catering contract, but if any primary school wants to serve pork we will work with them to arrange it.' 

But the council has said previously that it is too expensive to serve pork because it has to monitor what every child eats, in case those whose cultural or religious beliefs forbid pork - such as Muslim or Jewish children - eat it by accident.

Chris Godfrey, a master butcher who runs the 100-year-old Godfrey's butchers in Highbury Park, said: 'I feel quite strongly about this. I don't really feel we should pander too much to other religions.

'It's not a bad thing to show consideration, but that shouldn't restrict the choice of everyone else.

'The kids deserve to have a choice. I don't think this ban helps anyone.'

Dr Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association, said: 'This is something we are particularity concerned about. 

'It's something we have heard of but we wouldn't say it's common.

'It tends to happen in areas where there are large numbers of children from, for example, a Muslim background who wouldn't eat pork.

'But we would like there to be a choice. Pork is a very affordable and nutritious meat.'

Cllr Joe Caluori, Islington Council's executive member for children and families, said: 'By not having pork on the menus in our schools, we can keep down costs and reduce food waste, maximising the schools meal budget in tough financial circumstances.

'We meet regularly with our catering contractor and stakeholders and the feedback is that schools are very happy with the food offered by the service.'

A council spokesman said: 'Young children, some as young as four, of different religious and ethnic backgrounds may not know which foods contain pork, or may not realise the importance of avoiding it due to their culture or beliefs.

'Monitoring each child, every day ensuring they are avoiding pork, is an unnecessary cost at a time of tight budgets.'
