Search crews have located a father and his two children who had been missing for more than two days in the vast woods and swamps of the Congaree National Park southeast of Columbia, officials said Tuesday.

In a news release, the National Park Service said that rangers had located J.R. Kimbler, his 10-year-old son, Dakota, and 6-year-old daughter, Jade.

The three did not appear to be seriously hurt and were being taken to a local hospital for observation, officials said.

J.K. Kimbler has been rescued after spending more than two days in the woods wandering across a 27,000-acre national park

Kimbler's children, 10-year-old son, Dakota, and 6-year-old daughter, Jade, were also recovered and appear to have no major injuries from their time in the woods

The three did not appear to be seriously hurt and were being taken to a local hospital for observation, officials said.

Authorities planned to release more information later in the day.

Crews
 traveling by airplane, boat and on foot had been looking for the family
 in the 27,000-acre site since the father sent a text message late 
Saturday saying that they were lost.

Search crews found Kimbler, 43, two days after he sent a text message to a friend saying he and his kids were lost in the Congaree National Park east of Columbia

J.R.
 Kimbler sent a text message to a friend on Saturday around 9:30 p.m. 
saying he and his kids were lost. The friend called the children's 
mother, who called authorities.

A search 
party was immediately sent out.

Officials
 closed the park on Monday afternoon so they could fully concentrate on 
finding 43-year-old J.R. Kimbler, his 10-year-old son, Dakota, and 
6-year-old daughter, Jade.Â 

Kimbler 
had been out of his children's lives for a few years, but recently 
started to get them on the weekends, said Chris Ballard, stepbrother of the missing children. He took them to
 the skating rink and the zoo in recent weeks.

The mother of the two children, Tammy Ballard, spent the last two days at the park, walking down trails, calling their names

The trip to Congaree National Park was the first time he had been out there, he said.

An investigative team from the National Park Service had also checked on leads outside the park in case the family members had not been lost while hiking.

There had been no indication Kimbler, 43, took any camping gear or other items for an overnight stay.

Kimbler had never been in the park before and there was no indication he took any camping gear or other items for an overnight stay

The taxi driver left his cigarettes in his cab that was still parked near the visitor's center Monday and his daughter's inhaler and other medicine were in the hotel room where he lived, according to his family.

The park has marked trails, but beyond the paths are tangles of old growth trees, swamps and underbrush.

The land has become even more rugged since an ice storm in February knocked down thousands of trees and limbs.
