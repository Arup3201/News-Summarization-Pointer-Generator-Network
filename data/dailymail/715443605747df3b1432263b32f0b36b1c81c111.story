The mother of a two-year-old girl, who was still in the womb when her policeman father died on a drunken night out, has started a legal battle on their daughter's behalf to claim child maintenance from the Metropolitan Police.

Lawyers for toddler Tabitha Oxer-Patey say Scotland Yard's decision not to grant her a share of Richard Oxer's pension violates her human rights and discriminates against her as a child of unmarried parents.

An inquest into the death of PC Oxer, 31, heard he had drunk at least seven pints of lager with a 'half cut' group, including fellow officers, in June 2010, when he died after falling down a flight of stairs in a central London pub.

His partner Theresa Patey of Ashford, Middlesex, was four and a half months pregnant at the time.

Mr Oxer had been a police officer for six years and was stationed with the Met's territorial support group.

Claim: Some of football mad Richard Oxer's police pension should go towards supporting his child, his partner has claimed

The couple's then unborn daughter, Tabitha - who was delivered on November 10, 2011 - made a claim to the Met through her mother last year for entitlement to an allowance from her father's pension.

Any 'natural child' of a serving police officer is usually automatically entitled to support from his pension fund following his death, so long as he is still with the force when he dies.

However the company that handles pension pay-outs for the Met rejected Tabitha's claim last year, citing the highly unusual combination of her having not yet been born when her father died, as well as the fact that her parents were not married or in a civil partnership.

Through her mother, Tabitha has now launched a landmark legal battle to claim her 'inheritance'.

Her lawyers' claim that the decision was unlawful raises important questions about the rights of unborn children and unmarried couples.

Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe, who recorded a verdict of accidental death in September 2010, said of the accident at O'Neills, in Wardour Street: 'Mr Oxer went out with friends and tragically fell. He suffered a significant injury on both sides of his brain.'

The coroner heard that Mr Oxer had visited several bars on June 21 with friends and had drunk at least seven pints of lager before taking a taxi to central London.

Having ordered another round of drinks, the group, who were described a 'half-cut', went up to the roof terrace where they could smoke. It was on the way back downstairs that Mr Oxer fell and hit his head 'extremely hard', according to witnesses.

Ben Cooper, Tabitha's barrister, argues in a writ issued against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner at London's High Court that the refusal of support from her father's pension is discriminatory and breaches her right to respect for family life.

He argues that those parts of the Police Pension Fund Regulations which are said to exclude Tabitha from financial support - because she was born out of wedlock after her father's death - are 'incompatable' with the European Convention on Human Rights.

High Court: The legal battle is a key test case, as it could allow others to claim financial support for children not born until after their parent had died

Seeking a court declaration that Tabitha is entitled to a 'child survivors pension', the barrister states: 'Such a pension is analogous to a right of inheritance.'

He adds: 'The basis for such a refusal was an assertion (that), for child allowance to be payable, the child must have been born before the police officer ceased serving as an officer or passed away'.

Mr Cooper says that, under the regulations, a surviving natural child of a police officer, born before his death, is entitled to financial support, but that 'a child born after he dies is excluded from such an entitlement unless the officer was married to or in a civil partnership with the child's mother.

'The effect of (the regulations) is to discriminate against an illegitmate child born after the death of a serving police officer, compared with a legitimate child born in the same circumstances. There is no rational or legitimate justification for such discrimination,' he claims.

'Discrimination on grounds of birth, including illegitimacy, in relation to any convention right is prohibited by article 14 of the convention,' the barrister states.

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner's defence to the action was not available from the court, and the claims in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge. However Mr Cooper says that the case is 'unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact'.

Mr Oxer was a Tottenham Hotspur fan who played for two football teams, AFC Old Bank and Kingston Police FC. He was also a dog-lover and had three lurchers.
