Julie Bishop's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months with the Foreign Minister now rivalling Prime Minister Tony Abbott as preferred Liberal leader. 

A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop and Mr Abbott each have 20 percent support from voters in the preferred leadership stakes.

But the pair both fall into second place behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who remains the overall choice with 35 percent support.

The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security in recent months, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.

The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies.

Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent in June to 20 percent.

The Fairfax poll of 1,401 voters, carried out between Thursday and Sunday, found female voters heavily favoured Mr Turnbull or Ms Bishop. 

When asked by a journalist in Sydney if Ms Bishop was now Mr Abbott's heir apparent, he said: 'I think Julie is my stellar colleague.

'I think that's what she is, along with Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey, Scott Morrison and the rest of the team.' 

Treasurer Joe Hockey is draining support over the government's tough budget, dipping from 11 per cent in July to eight per cent.

Meanwhile, federal Labor has recorded its best Newspoll result in more than three months.

According to the poll, conducted for The Australian last weekend, Labor's primary vote rose two points in the last two weeks to 36 per cent - its highest level of support in three and a half months.

Coalition support remained steady at 38 per cent, while the Greens dropped one point to 13 per cent.

Independents and minor parties also fell one point, now sitting at 13 per cent.

The poll gives Labor its 13th consecutive lead over the coalition in two-party-preferred terms.
