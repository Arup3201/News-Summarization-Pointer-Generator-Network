'Anyone else remember the exquisite torture of falling for someone and not knowing how they felt? My life in jr. high.,' tweeted the show's creator, Peter Paige, who previously starred in Queer as Folk.

Jude and Connor's friendship has been building over the past two seasons and in a previous episode the boys had held hands at the movies and even kissed, although not on screen.

The boy's big moment isn't the first same-sex kiss between teenagers on TV, but it is the youngest as shows including Glee and Teen Wolf featured older teens, reports The Daily Beast.

The show, which premiered in 2013, is known for pushing the envelope and has been heavily criticized for it by right leaning organizations such as One Million Moms which had called for the show to be boycotted even before it aired.

The group, which has routinely advocated against the depiction of same-sex couples in the media, stated: 'While foster care and adoption is a wonderful thing and the Bible does teach us to help orphans, this program is attempting to redefine marriage and family by having two moms raise these children together.

In response, ABC Family President Michael Riley had responded that The Fosters merged perfectly with the network's 'groundbreaking storytelling and iconic characters' and will feature 'the same depth, heart, close relationships and authenticity that our viewers have come to expect'.

Co-executive producer Jennifer Lopez has previously described the show as portraying 'a new kind of family' and believes it is reflective of the world today.

'Family has tuned into something else,' said Lopez. 'Family equals love.'

The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation group has also praised the show and it received an award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2014 GLAAD Awards.
