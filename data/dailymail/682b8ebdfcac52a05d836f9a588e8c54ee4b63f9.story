Ross Bonaddio, 44, allegedly beat his girlfriend and held her captive in his home in Pennsylvania 

An alleged kidnapping victim has been jailed by a judge to ensure that she testifies against the boyfriend believed to have beaten her and held her captive. 

Faith Bronson, 34, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, is under house arrest until the trial of Ross Bonaddio, 44, in September. 

According to court documents, Ms Bronson had suggested to prosecutors that she would not cooperate and that she wanted to recant her police statements, prompting her arrest on July 24.  

Bonaddio was arrested on January 27 after Ms Bronson called 911 to report that she had been held hostage for three days.  

Police used a stun gun on Bonaddio at his Scranton home and released the naked woman who had been beaten. 

The Times-Tribune reported that Bonaddio has schizophrenia and has hallucinations. 

He had reportedly kept his girlfriend captive as he was trying to beat demons out of her as part of an exorcism. 

The words: 'Aliens in/out of human and animal bodies, Evil spirits enter invisible' was written on basement walls, according to The Times-Tribune.

Judge Saxton ordered the alleged kidnap victim put under house arrest last month 

Ms Bronson claimed that Bonaddio said his teenage sons had been taken over by aliens and he planned to shoot them when they next entered his home. 

Every door in the house was barricaded apart from the kitchen door which was bolted shut.  

Bonaddio was charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and attempted simple assault. He is being held on $100,000 bail.

Judge Richard Saxton put Ms Bronson under house arrest and ordered her not have any contact with Bonaddio. 

Although Ms Bronson can be compelled to be at the trial, she cannot be forced to testify.  

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania on the judge's unusual decision to imprison an alleged victim.  

Bonaddio's trial is due to begin on September 7.
