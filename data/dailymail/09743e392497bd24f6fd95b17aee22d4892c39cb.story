With Mauricio Pochettino still struggling to decide who will be leading Tottenham's line this season, Harry Kane staked his claim with another impressive performance in the Europa League.

The 21-year-old scored a superb effort in the first-leg against AEL Limassol to help Spurs take a 2-1 advantage into the return game at White Hart Lane on Thursday evening.

With Emmanuel Adebayor rested on the substitute's bench ahead of Sunday's visit from Liverpool and Roberto Soldado withdrawn from the squad with injury, Kane seized the opportunity to impress.

During an energetic 90 minutes, Kane had six attempts on goal and scored a superb opener - while his Opta Index touch map shows his involvement across the pitch and 11 touches in the opposition penalty area.

The youngster could, and probably should have, opened the scoring after only six minutes when a rash challenge  on Kyle Naughton led to the Limassol keeper Karim Fergouche being replaced and a penalty awarded to the hosts.

Despite the lengthy delay, Kane was brave enough to step forward - although his straight down the middle penalty was easily saved.

Nonethless, to his credit Kane did not allow the miss to affect his game as he continued to use his large frame to give the Cypriot defence a torrid time during an industrious first-half display.

Kane was not afraid to continue asking for the ball despite missing a few more first-half opportunities - including skying a superb chance after being set up with a back heel from Aaron Lennon in the Cypriot's penalty area. 

But, the graduate of Tottenham's youth system, was eventually rewarded for his perseverance just before the stroke of half-time.

Kane raced on to a slide rule pass from Brazilian midfielder Paulinho to cooly slot home Spurs' opening goal with a low finish that would have impressed his manager with his composure. 

Paulinho practically secured Tottenham's passage into the next stage of the competition when he drilled home a second within minutes of the re-start.

Tottenham noticeably eased back after taking a 4-1 aggregate lead, with Kane's role reduced to holding up the ball and involving others.

He did have another chance midway through the second-half, showing similar composure as he tried to surprise the keeper with a low effort at the near post that required a smart save.

Spurs were awarded a second penalty on 64 minutes, although another player hoping to earn recognition, Andros Townsend, argued for the responsibility before  effortlessly netting in the bottom right corner.

Kane could have easily had a hat-trick with a series of missed chances in the second-half, including another effort blocked by the feet of the keeper after being sent through by Aaron Lennon and some neat footwork in the box before being dispossesed. 

But he never stopped showing willingness, determination and desire. Kane was deservedly given man-of-the-match for a performance that accompanied a goal with superb ball retention, constant involvement and an enduring attitude.   

After the game, Pochettino said: 'I have always believed in Harry since the first day. 

'That is football. I think it is possible to miss penalties, but it is not important.

'He found a way to score, to play and did not let it affect his performance. It was good.

'He showed character and personality. He has a very strong mind and Harry is a very good player, too.' 

With Soldado's future at the club remaining uncertain before the close of the January transfer widow and Adebayor's reputation for inconsistency, Kane's stock at White Hart Lane is rising with every goal scored.
