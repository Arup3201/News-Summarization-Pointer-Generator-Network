This is the moment a huge humpback whale emerged from water close to the California coastline to say hello which seemed to startle a passing dog.

The amazing image was captured on Sunday by Kate Cummings, of the Blue Ocean Whale Watch, near Moss Landing in California's Monterey Bay. 

The whale lunged up out of the water to feed on a mouthful of anchovies.

According to Ms Cummings, the whales began appearing close to the shore over the weekend. 

Before Sunday the closest they would come to shore was about 100 yards but now it has been more like 50 yards.

Ms Cummings said this might be because anchovies had begun to bunch up closer to the shoreline. 

She told GrindTV: 'I think it has to do with the calmness of the ocean and the tides, plus the anchovies trying to seek refuge in shallow water—to no avail.

'The last few days our routine has been to first check out the whales lunge-feeding on anchovies along the beach, then head out a mile-and-a-half to groups of 10 to 12 humpbacks feeding together with hundreds of sea lions.

'The whales have drawn a crowd at the beach, and I was hoping she’d come up near a beachgoer for a sense of scale. The alert dog was a bonus.'

Humpback whales are known for their magical songs, which travel for great distances through the world's oceans.

These sequences of moans, howls, cries, and other noises are quite complex and often continue for hours on end.

Scientists are studying these sounds to decipher their meaning. It is most likely that humpbacks sing to communicate with others and to attract potential mates.

Mothers and their young swim close together, often touching one another with their flippers with what appear to be gestures of affection.

Calves do not stop growing until they are ten years old.

Humpbacks are powerful swimmers, and they use their massive tail fin, called a fluke, to propel themselves through the water.
