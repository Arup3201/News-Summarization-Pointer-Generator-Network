A six-month-old baby who has spent her entire life in hospital because of a super-rare condition which affects just 500 people in the world is finally going home.

April Karmazyn-Wall, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, suffers from Emanuel Syndrome, a genetic disorder which affects the body's cells and could mean she will never walk.

Despite her health problems, parents Nadia Karmazyn, 31 and Scott Wall, 25, are hoping she will be discharged from Newcastle's Royal Infirmary within the next few weeks.

Trooper: Six-month-old baby April Karmazyn-Wall, has Emanuel Syndrome, a rare and debilitating condition which only effects 500 people in the world

First time parents Nadia Karmazyn, 31 
and Scott Wall, 25, were unaware that their daughter had the condition 
until she was born.

Miss Karmazyn, a technical advisor, said: 'April was born by emergency caesarean section at 38 weeks, weighing 4lb 10oz.

'When she was born we did not know about the medical condition and we were shocked that she was diagnosed with it - it has been an incredibly difficult few months.

'April has quite a lot of medical problems but she smiles all the time and is easily entertained by the balloons around her cot.

'We can't put into words how proud we are of April as she has been through so much and continues to smile.'

Relief: Mother Nadia Karmazyn is looking forward to finally taking April to her new family home

Miracle baby: As well as Emanuel Syndrome, April suffers from a heart condition and has a cleft palate, but has battled through all of her health problems

She added: 'She is so happy and it is amazing she has got through it all.

'Babies with Emanuel Syndrome tend to have weak muscles and their development is impaired.'

Little is known about, Emanuel Syndrome so it is not known exactly how April will develop as she gets older. So far April has endured 10 operations and has to take three different types of medication.

Emanuel syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that disrupts normal development and affects many parts of the body.

It is caused by the presence of extra genetic material. People with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two. The excess genetic material disrupts development.

Infants with Emanuel syndrome have weak muscle tone and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate.

Their intellectual development is also usually significantly delayed.

About half of all affected infants are born with a cleft palate.

Miss Karmazyn added: 'A lot of babies with Emanuel Syndrome do not survive.

'April has low muscle tone and can't sit up as she is behind with her development.

'We are not sure if she will be able to walk or talk as it all depends on her - some children with the condition do, whilst others don't.

'But April has been so ill and it was touch and go as to whether she'd survive, so we are just so grateful that she is here with us.

'Whatever happens we will deal with it.'

April was also born with pulmonary atresia, meaning parts of the heart did not develop properly, and she received life-saving treatment at Newcastle Freeman Hospital's children's heart unit.

She also had a cleft palate and has had problems with her gut.

Nadia said: 'We can't wait for April to come home as she has only been home for one hour in her life.

'It will be lovely to be able to do normal things with April, like going shopping or go for a coffee with friends.'
