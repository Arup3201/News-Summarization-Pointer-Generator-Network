Mother Nature has created some mean running machines such as the ostrich, which has a top speed of 60mph (97km/h).

And while robots are not quite at the point where they could beat some animals in a race, scientists have created an incredible running machine with six rotating legs.

Taking inspiration from the natural world, the OutRunner is self-balancing and can reach speeds of 20mph (32km/h) on different terrains.

Design: The robot is biologically inspired and is self-balancing.

Legs: It has between six and 12 legs.

Price: The OutRunner Core model costs $299 (£177) and the Performance model $799 (£473).

Top Speed: The Core reached 10mph (16km/h) and the Performance 20mph (32km/h).

Operation: Either remote control, or a smartphone app for the OutRunner Performance.

Battery life: One hour for the Core and two hours for the Performance version.

Height: The core measures 1.5ft (46cm) and the Performance is slightly larger at 2ft (60cm)

Weight: 3lbs (1.4kg) for the Core and 5lbs (2.3kg) for the Performance.

Camera: Both have the option to mount a camera and the OutRunner Performance comes with an HD camera built-in.

Created by scientists at Robotics Unlimited, a spinoff of the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) in Pensacola, Florida, the robot claims to be the world’s first legged running robot that is commercially available to the public.

The company is raising money on Kickstarter to put the robot into production and said: ‘There is simply no other robot with such capabilities and so easy and fun to play with. All you need to do is just press the accelerator and steer it wherever you want it to go; it's that easy.’

It is biologically inspired and emulates the behaviour of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern as well as having a similar mass to length distribution, the company explained.

‘By having a centre of mass lower than the leg axis of rotation, OutRunner robots exploit a buoyancy effect, making them inherently stable and eliminating the need for expensive sensors and complex control algorithms,’ they said.

It claims to be energy efficient as the legs are used as energy storage systems, which allows for the conservation of kinetic energy during running.

The robotics team proved the stability of the robot by creating a version that is able to run on four rotating legs.

To steer the OutRunner, an owner uses a remote control to shift the mass of the robot by forcing it to lean to one side. This induces a turn, similar to steering a bicycle.

The robot is available to pre-order in two versions: A core model for $299 (£177) and the ‘performance’ model for $799 (£473). Both are expected to be shipped in mid-2015.

The core version will have a top speed of 10mph (16km/h) and a battery life of one hour. It will come with six legs and a camera mount and will be able to be operated using a remote control unit.

Measuring 1.5ft (46cm) tall, the commercial robot will weigh less than 3lbs (1.4kg).

The more expensive Performance model is twice as fast and uses a powerful out-runner brushless motor.

Its battery will last for two hours and users will be able to choose how many legs it has – from six to 12.

They will be able to use a remote control or their smartphone to steer the machine, which has an on-board accelerometer, gyroscope and HD camera.

Data from sensors and video footage will be streamed to a user’s smartphone using a Wi-Fi connection and hardware updates will be available to boost the robot’s performance. It measures 2ft (60cm) tall and weighs 5lbs (2.3kg).

The firm plans on organising a competition for its running robots by the end of 2015.
