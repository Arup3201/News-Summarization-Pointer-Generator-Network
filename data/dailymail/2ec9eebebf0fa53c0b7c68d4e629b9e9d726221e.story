A talented corgi has become an internet sensation after pictures of it balancing an array of household objects on its head have gone viral.

The pet, named Hazel, even has her own Tumblr blog where followers from around the globe ask her questions and can even request specific items to be used in her balancing act.

Hazel's owners, Bill Zildjian and his wife, Debra, from Maine, discovered the corgi's unusual gift two years ago.

Hazel the Corgi has become an internet sensation after her owners posted pictures of her balancing items including a teddy bear, left, and a cup and saucer, right, on her head

Tasty treat: Hazel resists temptation by balancing Oreo biscuits, left, and a bag of chips, right, on her nose

They began by placing small objects on her nose and rewarding her with a treat before realising there is almost nothing Hazel cannot balance on her head.

When deciding what to place on Hazel's head, the couple choose random household items, which include anything from toy dinosaurs to graduation caps.

Hazel has even celebrated the birth of the royal baby with her own unique tribute.

The Corgi was pictured with a silver spoon on her head to mark the birth of Prince George.

Mr Zildjian said: 'She has been balancing objects on her head for the camera for about two years, but only in the last year, since the blog started up, has she been doing it with any frequency.

'We have had Hazel since she was a puppy, and the pictures are a result of original treat-on-the-nose trick.

'Hazel is always rewarded for her efforts, usually with cheese, although sometimes other sorts of doggy treats are substituted.

'People's reactions range from "Awww, how cute", to laughter and even astonishment.'
