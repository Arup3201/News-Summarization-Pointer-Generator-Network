A woman lost her happily ever after on Wheel of Fortune after she answered the names of Snow White's seven dwarfs incorrectly, although she appeared fully confident with her answer.

The category was characters, and she only had six letters missing from a 41-letter, eight-word puzzle. 

When it came her turn to solve it, she - incorrectly - named the Snow White's seven dwarfs as Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Happy, Sneaky and Sleepy. 

The category for the round was 'Characters', and it appeared that the letters in the puzzle were forming the names of Snow White's seven dwarfs

She even already had more than half of 'Sneezy' filled in, only missing the z, which means she would have spelled 'Sneaky' incorrectly in her final answer.

The audience gasped at her wrong answer, and host Pat Sajak turns to her to say, 'I'm sorry. Jordan it's your turn.'

Jordan knew the answer and confidently says 'Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy'. 

He even paused dramatically before saying 'Sneezy'. 

When the contestant (center) says 'Sneaky' instead of 'Sneezy' she loses her chance and Jordan, the contestant to her right, takes the win by saying the names of all seven dwarfs

Contestant Jordan correctly named all seven dwarfs: Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy and Sleepy

This comes less than a month after a contestant made headlines for a remarkable correct guess at a two-word, 17-letter, puzzle using only one letter.

With only the letter on the board - T - in the category of 'event', the contestant named Rufus managed to correctly solve the puzzle within seconds.

His response was greeted with a huge round of applause, while even Sajak appeared shocked.

His remarkable guess bumped his prize money up from $1,700 to $7,100 and earned him a handshake from a very impressed Sajak.
