Thousands of jobs are at risk over the festive period as one of the UK's biggest parcel delivery services collapsed in to administration on Christmas Eve.

City Link, which has been loss-making for years, has called in the professional services firm Ernst and Young and stopped accepting parcels from customers. 

The news comes ahead of what is expected to be a busy time for retailers, with many chains starting their Boxing Day sales online 24 hours earlier. 

City Link, which has been loss-making for years, has called in the professional services firm EY and stopped accepting parcels from customers

EY said it expected 'substantial redundancies' over the coming days because no buyer had been found to save the troubled company. 

City Link, which is owned by investment firm Better Capital after it was purchased for £1 last year, is understood to count John Lewis among its largest clients.

Today the retailer told MailOnline that none of its orders had been affected by Citylink's collapse. 

'John Lewis has worked with City Link during this challenging period and provided significant support to enable them to trade.

'It is always a matter of deep regret when any of our suppliers are unable to continue with their business.

'John Lewis operates its deliveries and click and collect proposition through a number of external suppliers as well as its own in-house green van fleet. 

'This enables us to work flexibly and we have since transferred all our business with City Link to alternative carriers.' 

The courier company has suffered from poor systems and an overcrowded market in recent years, due to the rise in online shopping. 

Hunter Kelly, joint administrator to City Link, said: 'City Link Limited has incurred substantial losses over several years.

'These losses reflect a combination of intense competition in the sector, changing customer and parcel recipient preferences, and difficulties for the company in reducing its cost base.

'The strain of these losses became too great and all but used up Better Capital's £40 million investment, which was made in 2013 and intended to help to turn around the company.

City Link, which has its head office in Coventry (pictured), said it had annual revenues of approximately £300million, a fleet of 1,700 vehicles and delivered 60million items each year

'Despite the best efforts to save City Link Limited, including marketing the company for sale, it could not continue to operate as a going concern and administrators were appointed.

'We have temporarily suspended operations at all transport hubs and depots until Monday, when we intend to reopen depots to the public to enable customers and intended recipients to collect their parcels.

'We will also provide support to employees relating to potential redundancies. We are now beginning the process of realising the company's assets.' 

Customers who had placed parcels with the company on Christmas Eve and intended recipients who have been notified of a failed or pending delivery are urged to retrieve their parcels as soon as possible on or after Monday.

They can do so at the company's 53 depots throughout the UK, which will remain open for a short period of time to enable people to collect their parcels. 

The firm's online parcel tracking system remains live and a help phone will be open on Saturday  and from Monday. 

Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: 'This is the bitterest blow any group of workers could receive on Christmas Day and it is absolutely shocking that the company have sprung this announcement once all the Christmas deliveries have been completed.

'RMT will do everything within its power to mobilise a political and industrial fight to save the thousands of jobs that have been put at risk as a result of this shock announcement.' 

The RMT told its members that it understood wages owed up to December 31 would be paid, but any further payments are not guaranteed.

Founded in 1969, City Link - which has its head office in Coventry - said it had annual revenues of approximately £300million, a fleet of 1,700 vehicles and delivered 60million items each year. 

At this stage, no redundancies have been made among the employees.
