An autopsy on Ryan Knight, who starred in MTV's The Real World: New Orleans, was completed on Friday but no immediate cause of death was found, according to reports.

The reality TV star, 29, passed away on Wednesday night after a night out. A close friend toldTMZ that friends found him on Thursday morning.

TMZ also reported that several close friends of Knight claim he had 'taken some pills' but did not specify what kind, while another friends claims he had 'choked on his own vomit'.

Tragedy: MTV's The Real World cast member Ryan Knight - pictured here in September 2013 in New York - dead at 29 'after his body is found by friends following a night of partying'

Worrying: Knight's last tweet on Wednesday, just hours before he was found dead

His cause of death will not be determined until the toxicology results come in.

TMZ alleges that Knight's father said the late star had stomach pains in the two days before his death, but that police found no clear signs of injury. 

Before appearing on The Real World, Knight had been a hockey player who lost his college scholarship and became addicted to painkillers after injuries to both of his shoulders.

After his death, his girlfriend of several months, Makenzie Jauer, a 21-year-old student originally from Texas, wrote a message on Instagram, pouring her heart out.

Sadness: After his death, she posted this message to Twitter before paying tribute to him on Instagram

She wrote: 'I love you Ryan Knight. I am heartbroken, confused, hurt and most of all mad. The pain I am feeling now will never go away.

'You mean more to me than you will ever know & I never thought that I would spend a day without you. Every second with you was full of love and laughter. You were the brightest light in every room.'

She went on: 'You taught me not to care about what other people think and you made me understand that being myself was okay. Thank you for being inappropriate at the worst of times and making me laugh until I cried.

'Thank you for loving me unconditionally even though I snored and drooled on you in my sleep. You had the sweetest soul and I will never forget that. I always called you "my sweet angel" and now you truly are. Love you forever, MEK.'

Fellow MTV reality star Diem Brown tragically died earlier this month at the age of 32 after a battle with cancer. Knight recently changed his Twitter profile picture to a snap of himself and Diem.

Reality star: Ryan is seen here on MTV's The Challenge: Rivals II (where he became friends with Diem Brown)

The pair did not star together on MTV's The Real World, however, Knight did appear on The Challenge alongside Diem.

Following The Challenge, Diem made a name for herself as an entertainment reporter after and their paths crossed on the reality television circuit.

He was known as a bit of a villain on the reality show, and Knight himself jokingly put his Twitter bio as: 'Sooooo I'm the a**hole'. 

Worryingly his last tweet on Wednesday was simply a message that read 'You used to mean a lot'.

His ex-girlfriend Jemmye Carroll took to Twitter on Thursday to say 'thank you for your kind words' to her followers. 

She added: 'Words will never be enough to justify the connection we shared and the pain I will forever feel. RIP'.
