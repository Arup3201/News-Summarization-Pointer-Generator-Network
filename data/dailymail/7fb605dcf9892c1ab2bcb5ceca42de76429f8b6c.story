A U.S. military hardware company has revealed the latest prototype for a robotic battlefield 'pack mule'.

Alphadog is the next generation of the Big Dog project, which is in development at Boston Dynamics with funding from Darpa and the Marine Corps.

The mechanical quadruped - which bears a passing resemblance to the At-At walkers from the Star Wars films - has a series of improvements on its predecessor which will leave the Big Dog cowering in its kennel.

See Alphadog in action below...

Alphadog: The robot horse prototype, made by Boston Dynamics, is designed to carry military equipment in battle to make soldiers lighter and more mobile

Do push me: The Alphadog is able to stand up to the pressure of two men pushing it over, or even kicking it, which would help it resist nearby bomb blasts too

Though headless, it resembles a horse more than a dog in both size and strength, with increased endurance and distance capabilities that allow it to carry 400lbs of payload and trek for 20 miles.

It is also now virtually silent. The Big Dog was saddled with a whining noise that was akin to a low powered motorcycle engine, but the Alphadog seemingly makes no sound other than those of its 'hooves' on the ground.

And where the Big Dog looked like 'Bambi on ice' when it was unsteadied by undulating ground due to its long thin legs, the AlphaDog's thicker legs make it more powerful and stable.

The prototype is formally known as the L3, which stands for Legged Squad Support System.

Steady as she goes: Alphadog's state of the art hydraulics enables it to walk over uneven ground

Self-righting: Alphadog is able to flip itself back onto its 'feet' if it is knocked onto its side

It is designed to carry equipment for troops and is capable of navigating uneven ground such as steps, hills, rubble and logs thanks to its GPS, computer vision and the eerily realistic leg movement offered by state-of-the-art hydraulics.

Alphadog is set to be officially unveiled next year but the video below shows the latest developments.

It is now able to steady itself when pushed and kicked powerfully by two men, but most impressively if it does fall onto its side, Alphadog has a full self-righting mechanism that will return it to its 'feet'.

As technological advances improve the range of weapons and equipment at soldiers' disposal, so their loads become heavier.

British commanders in Afghanistan have previously warned that today's troops are simply too weighed down by kit when on foot patrol as they lug up to 150lb - in summer temperatures that push 50 degrees centigrade.

'If LS3 can offload 50 pounds from the back of each soldier in a squad, it will reduce warfighter injuries and fatigue and increase the combat effectiveness of our troops,' Marc Raibert, the president of Boston Dynamics, told PhysOrg.com.
