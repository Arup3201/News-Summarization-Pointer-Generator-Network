As hungry Mark Hunter prepared to take his second spoonful of cereal he simply could not believe his eyes.

Because suddenly a dark shape bobbed to the surface of his milk-filled bowl of Rice Krispies and in a nightmare scenario for anyone, it turned out to be a dead mouse.  

The calm father of two, 42, from Maida Vale, London, fished it out, dried it off and got straight on the phone to maker Kellogg's.

Nasty taste: Mark Hunter was about to take a second mouthful of rice krispies when this dead mouse bobbed to the surface

'I was horrified because I’d already had one mouthful and was about to have a second,' he told the Mirror.

'I saw this dark shape appear in the milk, but I didn’t realise what it was until I fished it out with my spoon.'

Kellogg's have admitted they are horrified by what has happened and will be heading to Mr Hunter's home to pick up the mouse and find out where it came from.

Experts from the University of Liverpool believe they can work out its origin.

Calm: Mr Hunter took the mouse out, dried it off and called Kellogg's - who are coming to collect it and work out where it came from

Spokesman Paul Wheeler said it was an 'extremely rare' case, adding: 'We are devastated and will be investigating fully.'

It is not the first time a mouse, or other disgusting finds, have appeared in food.

Three years ago a woman in Devon found a dead mouse in a jar of Asda’s Extra Special curry sauce, while in 2010 Hovis was fined £750 after a customer was sold a loaf with part of an oven glove baked into it.

Across the Atlantic a Florida couple found a frog in a can of Diet Pepsi and a North Carolina man discovered a severed finger in a carton of frozen custard.
