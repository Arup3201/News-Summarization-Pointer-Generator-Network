Roy Keane has spoken to Celtic owner Dermot Desmond about the vacant manager’s job.

Republic of Ireland coach Martin O’Neill said on Thursday night that he had given Desmond permission to speak to his assistant.

While the appointment has yet to be confirmed, O’Neill appears to have accepted that Keane is poised to succeed Neil Lennon at Celtic Park, though former West Brom boss Steve Clarke is also a contender.

O’Neill said: ‘I had a call  the other 
day from Dermot  Desmond wanting to speak to Roy if it was at all 
possible, and I mentioned it to Roy, of course.

'A club like Celtic might not come around
 too often. It was just a really informal chat, but if you are asking me
 would I be really disappointed? Of course, if Roy was to leave us.’

It
 was Desmond who brokered the deal which saw Keane become O’Neill’s 
assistant with the Republic of Ireland. O’Neill has stayed on friendly 
terms with the millionaire since his own  successful spell as Celtic 
boss.

Bookies stopped taking bets on Keane, 42, who has not been in 
club management since he was sacked by Ipswich in 2011 after two 
disappointing seasons.

He cut his teeth at Sunderland, but he resigned after falling out with then chairman Niall Quinn and owner Ellis Short.

Since
 then Keane, who had a six-month spell with Celtic at the end of his 
playing career, has carved out a career as a tough-talking football 
pundit. Last November he agreed to become O’Neill’s assistant with the 
Republic of Ireland. The Irish play Italy at Craven Cottage tomorrow 
night and O’Neill expects Keane to be alongside him.

Celtic said: ‘We are currently continuing discussions with a number of excellent candidates.’
