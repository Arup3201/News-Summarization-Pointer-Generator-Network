Media mogul Tyler Perry has defeated a fledgling reality television star to win the trademark for the title 'What Would Jesus Do?'

The result ends a long and bitter court battle between the actor-director and Kim 'Poprah' Kearney, a reality TV star best known for an appearance of I Want To Work For Diddy on VH1.

Kearney had filed for the trademark of What Would Jesus Do in January 2008 order to make a Christian reality series.

Then in May of that year Tyler Perry Studios filed to secure the same trademark in order to use it for films, musicals and television series, according to The Guardian.

Winner: Tyler Perry, 44, has officially won the trademark to use 'What Would Jesus Do?' as a film, musical and/or TV series

It is not know exactly what Perry intends to do with the title.

However Kearney claims she discussed the Christian reality show with Perry before either of them filed for the trademark.

The studio’s legal team argued that Kearney had no intention of using What Would Jesus Do as she initially claimed in her trademark application.

Perry's people had to prove a burden of proof in order to cancel Kearney's trademark application.

They argued Kearney failed to produce a television show with the title and that her website for the show did not actually function.

Cancellation of the trademark is now pending after the trademark office granted its cancellation on non-use grounds on June 20.

Perry’s trademark says that no claim in its trademark is made to use 'Jesus' exclusively.

The phrase was popularised in the United States in the 1990s, appearing on bracelets and T-shirts.

Kearney took to Twitter to thank people for their support.

'Thanks every1 who has reached out bout the board letting @tylerperry steal my trademark 4 What Would Jesus Do-but its not over-God got this!' she posted on Thursday.
