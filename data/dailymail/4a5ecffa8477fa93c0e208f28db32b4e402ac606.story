Two thirds of jurors do not understand a judge’s legal direction, research has revealed.

As lawyers and judges tried to defend the jury system in the aftermath of the collapse of the trial of Chris Huhne’s ex-wife Vicky Pryce, the study found that jurors in that case were not alone in failing to grasp their brief.

The two-year analysis of trial by jury also found that jurors frequently used the internet to research trials, despite warnings not to do so because of the risk of miscarriages of justice.

Scrutiny: The collapse of the trial of Vicky Pryce, left, ex-wife of former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, right, has raised questions about the strength of the jury system

The researchers suggested that jurors should be given written cards which clearly explained their responsibilities throughout the trial process.

Former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, called for further research into the system of trial by jury, including greater study of jurors’ deliberations. The jurors in the Pryce trial sent the judge an extraordinary list of questions about basic aspects of the case.

Mr Justice Sweeney said the questions demonstrated ‘absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding’ and he discharged the jury.

The questions included: ‘Can a juror come to a verdict based on a reason that was not presented in court and has no facts or evidence to support it, either from the prosecution or the defence?’

Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said the case highlighted the need for greater scrutiny of juries’ deliberations.

Under the Contempt of Court Act it is a criminal offence to ask about any opinions expressed during a jury’s attempts to reach a verdict in a case.

Lord Macdonald told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘We perhaps ought to allow a bit more access to jury reasoning than we do.

‘I think it is impossible for researchers to conduct any kind of examination at any time into what has gone on in jury rooms.’

He said other countries allowed researchers to question jurors about their deliberations and thought processes.

Lord Macdonald added: ‘I think it’s one of the greatest strengths of our system that we bring citizens into its heart.

‘The feeling of most criminal lawyers is that, by and large, most juries come to the right decision and that most criminal trials end in the right verdict.’

Lord Woolf, the former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he believed the jury system was ‘well tried’ and that the Pryce case was ‘exceptional’.

He said juries acted as the ‘final safety valve’ in the legal system because they allowed ordinary men and women to decide a case and to guard against potential miscarriages of justice.

Leading criminal lawyer John Cooper QC said the alternative to trial by jury was the ‘frightening’ prospect of all verdicts being reached by judges. He added: ‘Sometimes juries get it right, sometimes they get it wrong. This is a system based on human beings and human beings are fallible.

‘But the alternative is more frightening, the alternative is not being tried by our peers and by a judge.’

Michael Turner QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said he thought the Pryce jury’s questions were ‘perfectly sensible’.

He said: ‘It’s disrespectful to suggest that they weren’t working it through.

‘If you were put on trial by the State would you want someone who is salaried by the State to be judging the facts of it? Of course you wouldn’t. You would want ordinary people to do it.’

Trial by jury is an expensive process which costs the taxpayer £3,000 a day once a case is sent to Crown Court. Several Home Secretaries and justice ministers have considered reforms to axe the right to jury trial for some offences.

Jack Straw tried to reduce the number of cases that go before juries and David Blunkett tried to introduce judge-only trials in complex fraud cases. But the proposals met opposition from civil liberty campaigners and the House of Lords.

Pryce, 60, will face a retrial over the allegation that she perverted the course of justice by taking her then-husband Huhne’s speeding points a decade ago. She denies the charge.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Trial by jury has served us well for hundreds of years and delivers justice across the country every day.’
