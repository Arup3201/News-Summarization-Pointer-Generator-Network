Horror stories detailing how Londoners were fed ice-creams 'made in the gutter', lived above open cesspits and sold putrid foods containing 'cockroaches and cobwebs' were revealed for the first time today.

These 5,000 documents, published online, show how the capital's medical officers fought to protect the public from filthy conditions, rancid produce and gradually improve their health.

The Wellcome Library in London has also released a series of fascinating 
photographs showing more than a century of efforts to educate millions 
about how to live longer.

1963: This friends of Fulham Hospital carnival float was driven through the streets to champion the fight against lung cancer, and carried a boxing ring with variety star Nosmo King knocking out an actor playing Lung Cancer

1974: Public health posters used to encourage people to give up smoking or to eradicate head lice among young children

These remarkable first-hand accounts spanning 150 years of London life are contained in 
bound books compiled each year by the Medical Officers of Health.

1848 - Experts describe families living in slums on 'boarded over cesspools'

1860 - Widow found with husband's corpse in bedroom so she could kiss it each night

1914 - Ice cream vendors selling wares to children in glasses they would lick clean

1978 - Port of London inspector finds shop selling a 'ham, tomato and 
cockroach roll' and a 'decomposed chicken sandwich'.

They show how east London schoolchildren were given ultraviolet 'canned sunshine' to improve their health in winter from 1925 and how in a century the most popular takeaways went from oysters and eels to Chinese food.

The searchable database of reports, called London's Pulse, runs from 1848 to 1973.

Importantly they act as a form of census,  revealing how many were born and how people died, as well as where they lived and worked.

In the first year of reports John Simon, the first medical officer described how slums in London were built on top of cesspits.

'In a very large number of cases... the basement story of the house 
is tenanted, the cesspool lies – perhaps merely boarded over – close 
beneath the feet of a family of human beings whom it surrounds 
uninterruptedly, whether they wake or sleep, with its fetid pollution 
and poison.'

1967: A dental health campaign used a clown to entertain and educate children at a school in Tower Hamlets

1962: Two volunteers collect 'Meals on wheels' from their van in Stepney to deliver to the elderly and unwell

1929: This photograph taken in Isleworth, west London, shows how babies were weighed as Britain struggled for food at the start of the Great Depression

The years of reports reveal not only the stranger side of life, but also the more sinister.

One wife kept her dead husband at home because she wanted to kiss his rotting corpse each night. 

A report from 1860 reveals how a neighbour in a plush street just off Hanover Square had complained because his pregnant wife was feeling sick because of the stench.

A Dr Aldis investigated and found 'a dead body here in so offensive a state that it caused a nuisance 
throughout the house, from the widow frequently removing the lid to kiss
the deceased'.

He decided that 'the body (was) to be covered in sawdust, 
and the lid to be screwed down immediately, which was done, and the 
burial took place soon afterwards'.

Reports also reveal '22 instances where corpses were kept in inhabited rooms for prolonged 
periods so as to be a nuisance'.

Feeding a city the size of London is a difficult task, and the documents show how businesses were punished if they tried to sell food unfit for human consumption.

One document reveals how on August 5, 1870, 'sixty-eight trunks of haddocks, in a putrid condition
were found in the possession of Mr William Reed, a wholesale fish 
salesman in Columbia Market', in Bethnal Green.

The medical officer wrote: 'I proceeded to the Market and when 
about to seize the fish was prevented from so doing by some of the 
employees abetted by the market inspector.

'The men at once 
proceeded to load the fish in a van, which had been hired in the 
neighbourhood and it was not without great difficulty, for the men were 
very violent, we seized one trunk of the Haddock'.

1964: A huge team of food workers in this east London factory in Stepney break eggs for pasteurisation to reduce the risk of food poisoning

1938: This invention was called the 'Open air public health propaganda Cinemotor', which was taken to this school in Bermondsey, south-east London, to show them public health films and photographs

1971: This young boy has his eyes tested in Lewisham, south-east London, using a wooden spoon to obscure the eye and right in 1929, a little boy is weighed near Hounslow

In 1914 one health inspector described poor hygiene at ice cream stalls, a foodstuff prescribed by some doctors to improve the health of children.

The report said: 'The ice-cream vendors are probably the filthiest 
tradesmen in London. Their ice-cream is, or may be, 
made in the gutter.

'The use of the small conical glasses 
which are mouthed and sucked by children is most undesirable. For 
cleaning they are dipped into dirty water which contains the mouth 
secretions of previous buyers, swabbed with a small wet offensive duster
and upended on a soiled barrow top.

'One itinerant attempted to 
improve upon this method by immersing his right thumb into this same 
nauseous water and rubbing it vigorously on the inside of the glass: he 
used no duster.

'Another was giving the final polish to his glasses by 
rubbing them inside and outside with his handkerchief into which he blew
his nose.

'Still another cleaned out the form in which he made ice-cream
sandwiches by licking it with his tongue.'

1957: A rat catcher displays the number of rodents he has caught in and around the slums of Bermondsey

1957: Another worker prepares deadly bait for the rats on what is described as a Bermondsey 'rat run'

1947: This image from Barking, east London, shows how schoolchildren were given 'Canned sunshine' from an ultraviolet lamp that 'glows vigour into young bodies in the Winter'

Slum days: Many suffered ill-health due to starvation in Victorian Britain, such as these London children in 1860

Decades later the problems were still very bad, with one report from 1978 detailing how they fined businesses for selling biscuits containing 'insect
excreta and webbing', a 'ham, tomato and 
cockroach roll' and a decomposed chicken sandwich'.

Simon Chaplin, Head of Wellcome Library said: 'The Medical Officers of Health reports provide a fascinating portrait of London life and the lives of Londoners. 

'London’s Pulse opens up a wealth of information about Londoners’ homes and workplaces, food and drink and of course health and illness, and enables researchers and curious readers to search and cross reference the reports with ease. 

'The resource helps fulfil the Wellcome Library’s ambition to make our collections freely available and accessible to all.'

Paola Marchionni, programme manager at Jisc, who digitised the documents said: 'The Medical Officer of Health reports are a real treasure chest of information, so opening them up for use by researchers and the public is vital if we're to make good use of them.'
