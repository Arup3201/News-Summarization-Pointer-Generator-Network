The letter is addressed to  ‘whoever is brave enough to read me’. But the real bravery belongs to the little girl who wrote it.

Nine-year-old Caitlin Robertson is trying to persuade the public to join the organ donor register following the death of her father, Gary.

He died from an aneurysm on his 39th birthday last year, but saved four lives by donating his organs.

Caitlin is so proud of her father, 
whom she affectionately called her ‘Gary Baldy biscuit’, that she wants 
others to follow his example.

Her handwritten letter - illustrated with a pencil drawing of her dad - reads: ‘My dad Gary always helped other people.

‘My dad isn't here to watch me and my brothers grow up, but he gave all his organs to other people so now other people will get to see their children grow up.

‘I miss my dad every day but I'm so proud I was his daughter.

‘Please put your name on the organ donor list so you can save lives just like my dad.’

Mr Robertson's death inspired Caitlin to write the letter which is decorated with a drawing of her father. She wrote: 'Please put your name on the organ donor list so you can save lives just like my dad'

Caitlin’s mother Emma, 34, from, 
Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I am immensely proud of Caitlin's efforts
 to raise the profile of organ donation.

‘Gary saved four lives within hours but the total number of lives he saved will never be known.

‘My children have gone through something horrendous, but they are still always thinking of other people - just like their dad.

‘Everything that can be used for organ donation was used. Skin from back of his leg was taken for skin grafts.

‘Bones
 were taken to grind down and help with knee and hip replacements. The 
corneas of eyes were taken so someone has a new set of eyes.

‘Tubes
 from his neck were taken to help with heart operations. People don’t 
realise what can be recycled and give people a much better life, or even
 save a life.

‘Gary was a care assistant, and we'd spoken about him being on the organ donor list.

‘His
 attitude was “when you're gone, you're gone” - and I didn't think twice
 about giving the hospital permission to use his organs to help other 
people.

‘We have been told that a 29-year-old man has been given Gary's heart.

‘If
 it contains just even a little bit of the love Gary had for his family,
 then the person receiving it is very lucky - as he's got a heart from a
 very good man.

‘He 
managed to help people even after his death, and although we all miss 
Gary more than I could possibly put into words, it is comforting to know
 that he stopped four other families going through the same pain that we
 have.’

Through his death, Mr Robertson saved at least four lives. His family has been told that his heart was given to a 29-year-old man

Mr Robertson died on his 39th birthday - just hours after complaining of a severe headache.

He had been suffering from headaches for two weeks before the aneurysm, but had put the symptoms down to stress.

But on his birthday, he was unable to get out of bed to look after his children - Caitlin, Ben, nine, and Joe, three.

Emma rushed him to hospital, after he started vomiting and collapsed.

Medics
 at South Tyneside District Hospital rushed him to Newcastle's Royal 
Victoria Infirmary, but after taking him in for surgery, doctors 
revealed he was brain dead.

He had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm.

Mr Robertson even donated skin to be used for grafts, his corneas, and blood vessels to be used in heart surgery. He was found to have a ruptured aneurysm after suffering severe headaches, vomiting and weakness

A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel in the brain that is caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall.

As the blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon.

Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they rupture - this can cause extensive brain damage.

Only about one in 12,500 people in the UK suffer a ruptured brain aneurysm every year.

Mrs Robertson said: ‘He couldn't speak or stand.

‘When
 they took him into surgery there had been so much tension and build-up 
from the fluid on his brain and he'd been starved of oxygen, there was 
just nothing they could do.

‘They said they also found a pea-sized malignant tumour, but that hadn't caused this, it's just been one of those things, nothing anyone could have predicted.

‘The children were devastated. They couldn't understand why their dad hadn't come home for the birthday tea they had planned for him.

‘I became involved with organ donation, and when I went to a meeting earlier this year, Caitlin wanted to come with me - but I wouldn't allow her to have any more time off school.

‘So she decided to write a letter from her for me to read out instead- and everyone was so touched.’

She added: ‘It's been incredibly tough. Gary and I were married for almost 10 years, and he was my best friend.

‘I used to call him Mr Perfect, and all my friends used to joke they wished their husbands were as perfect as Gary.

‘He's left a huge hole in our lives, but I'm glad that we have been able to use something awful to campaign for something positive to happen.

‘We will keep campaigning in Gary's name.’
