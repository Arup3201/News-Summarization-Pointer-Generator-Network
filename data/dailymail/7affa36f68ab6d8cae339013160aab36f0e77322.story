Leeds have sacked Graham Bean as their consultant after a disagreement over the club’s rearranged fixture against Reading next Wednesday. 

The 53-year-old was fired on Thursday after agreeing to move the club’s clash against the Royals back by 24 hours - much to the annoyance of club’s owner Massimo Cellino. 

The decision to reschedule the Championship match was made in July to accommodate Reading’s televised game against Wolves on Sunday.

Discussions between Bean, the Football League and former Leeds head coach David Hockaday were made before the decision was ratified. 

Despite being agreed two months ago, the news has only recently come to Cellino’s attention with the Italian aggrieved about the club’s continued rearranged fixture list due to television demands - leading to Bean’s dismissal. 

Former FA employee Bean confirmed his departure four months into his one-year contract in a statement to the Yorkshire Evening Post: ‘I’ve enjoyed my time working with the staff at Leeds United.

‘As far as working with Mr Cellino is concerned, I’d prefer not to comment. I wish the team every success for the season.’

In response to Bean's statement, Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'Bean was an external consultant, this is a private matter and I don't want to speak about it publicly.'

Prior to his sacking Bean had been been responsible for much of Leeds’ administrative work during Cellino’s short tenure to date. 

He helped oversee a major overhaul in the Whites playing squad ahead of this campaign with 15 players coming in as well as the £11million sale of Ross McCormack to Fulham.
