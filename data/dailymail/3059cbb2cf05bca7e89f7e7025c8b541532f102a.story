Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas and his pregnant girlfriend Daniella Semaan brushed shoulders with celebrities, Bollywood stars and even a Prince at the British Asian Trust dinner on Tuesday night.

The former Barcelona and Arsenal ace attended the glitzy bash donning a rather dapper tuxedo with his stunning partner Daniella, who looked equally as good.

The couple posed for pictures and even met Prince Charles, Prince of Wales at the event at The Banqueting House, Whitehall.

It seems the Spanish international midfielder has adopted the ‘work hard play hard’ mentality having been outstanding for Jose Mourinho’s side this season.

The 27-year-old has been one of the west London club’s star players this season along with fellow La Liga recruit Diego Costa.

Fabregas has helped launch the Stamford Bridge club to the top of the Premier League since his arrival and will be hoping the well-earned rest will see Chelsea reap the rewards against Aston Villa on Saturday.

Fabregas has had an awesome season since swapping La Liga for a return to the Premier League
