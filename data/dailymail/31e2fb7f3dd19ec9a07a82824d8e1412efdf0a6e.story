Paediatrician Dr Nelly Ninis promised herself that if a vaccine against the meningitis B infection were discovered, she would have her children immunised.

'I've seen too many children die from this horrific disease or lose multiple limbs or suffer brain damage,' says Dr Ninis, 47, a consultant at the private Hospital of St  John and St Elizabeth in London.

'I consider myself a tough nut after nearly 25 years working as a doctor in children's infectious diseases, but I get so upset when I think about all the families who have been devastated by meningitis B.

'The scary thing is just how quickly it takes hold. In less than four hours of experiencing their first symptoms - which may just be a temperature, vomiting or a flu-like illness - they can be in multiple organ failure. In 24 hours, they can be dead.'

Around 10 per cent of those who catch meningitis B die within 24 to 48 hours, even if they receive antibiotics. One in five is left with long-term problems, including limb amputation, hearing loss, learning disabilities and brain damage.

Meningococcal B is a bacterium that causes the most common form of bacterial meningitis, meningitis B - an infection of the meninges, the protective membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This meningitis kills by causing intense pressure on the brain. If bacteria enter the bloodstream, they can also cause septicaemia, which can lead to shock and multiple organ failure.

A new vaccine against the bacterium is available in the UK, but can only be obtained privately.

This is because after spending a year deliberating, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - an independent body of experts which advises the Government - provisionally recommended last July that the jab should not be routinely given to all of the estimated 700,000 babies born in the UK each year.

Instead, it said it should only be given to those with certain immuno-deficiencies, such as disorders of the spleen, or those on immune-suppressant drugs.

So why would other babies not be offered protection? The experts deemed it was not cost effective.

But Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, says: 'The UK's child mortality rates are among the highest in Europe and MenB contributes to this terrible fact.'

The charity reckons the costs of caring for meningitis survivors with serious disability can be at least £3 million per child, once caring, loss of earnings and rehabilitation are considered.

Meningitis B infections can affect all age groups, but children, and especially babies, are at risk due to their immature immune systems. No other infectious disease kills as many under-fives as bacterial meningitis and septicaemia and most cases are caused by meningococcal bacteria. Between 2006 and 2011, 247 adults and children died from meningitis caused by meningococcal B in England and Wales, and about 3,400 are affected by bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK.

Around 10 per cent of people carry the bacterium harmlessly in their throat, but can pass it on to others. Sometimes outbreaks occur at universities because students live in close proximity.

Symptoms are varied and may be similar to flu in the early stages, so it can be difficult to diagnose.

The vaccination costs around £75 a time privately - and children may need several.

Babies aged two to five months need four injections, one to two months apart; those aged six months to two years need three; the over-twos need two.

The vaccine committee is now reconsidering the evidence and will announce its ruling next month. Already, 118 paediatricians, nurses and scientists have written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pressing for the committee to reverse its decision.

'It is a cause for concern to us that after years of research, a vaccine which could prevent a significant proportion of cases of this dreadful disease might simply be shelved,' they wrote.

Dr Ninis, who signed the letter, says the opportunity to introduce the vaccine is 'a historic moment'.

'The UK has had one of the highest rates of MenB in the world - scientists still don't know why this is, but we could be the first country in the world to eradicate it if we introduce routine vaccinations,' she says. 'The vaccine against meningococcal C (a different strain of meningococcal bacteria),

introduced in 1999, has been incredibly successful. But the majority of bacterial meningitis infections in the UK are caused by MenB.'

One man who needs no convincing about the jab is Paul Challis, whose daughter Ellie May, now nine, developed meningitis caused by meningococcal B at 16 months. She lost both her hands and the lower part of both her legs.

'She developed a temperature and nothing we did would bring it down,' says Paul, 50, a former betting shop manager who lives with wife Lisa, 40, and their five other children in Little Clacton, Essex.

'I took her to A&E at midnight, a 
few hours after she first developed the temperature, but was told she 
had a urine infection and we were sent home. In the morning, though, she
 was sick and as I lifted her top, I saw two tiny cherry red spots each 
the size of a pen top. I drove her back to A&E, barged into triage 
and showed the doctor the spots - by then there were 12.

'Within minutes, all hell broke loose - she had tubes everywhere and about ten doctors and nurses were swarming round her.'

Four hours later, Ellie was rushed by ambulance to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington and her heart stopped twice on the way. Ellie was in a coma for three weeks.

'Doctors explained her body had diverted blood to save her organs, causing a loss of supply to the extremities, and her hands and feet would have to be amputated,' says Paul. 'We wondered what quality of life she could have. Within weeks, though, she had started to move around on her bottom.'

After standard prosthetic limbs proved uncomfortable, the family paid privately to have carbon blades made - she was the youngest recipient ever to have them.

'She is a fantastic kid and things have worked out better than we could have ever hoped - but obviously, given the choice, we would far rather she hadn't had this terrible disease.

'The jabs will cost hundreds of pounds privately and that is going to be too expensive for a lot of families - they should be available on the NHS to every child.'

Paul says while Ellie is fantastic, given the choice, he would far rather she hadn't had this terrible disease

There is no doubt the vaccine committee has a difficult decision to make, says Dr Matthew Snape, consultant in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford, who helped conduct some trials for the vaccine.

He says: 'The manufacturers claim the vaccine will be effective in preventing 75 to 88 per cent of MenB in the UK, but this is only based on lab tests. We won't know how effective it will be until we start using it on large numbers of people,' he says.

'The committee face a difficult decision because we don't have all the evidence - but we won't get it unless we introduce it.'

The cost of introducing mass vaccination for babies, and a catch-up campaign for toddlers and 15- to 18-year-olds, are potentially huge. Dr Ninis paid privately for the jabs for her two youngest children, and her eldest, aged 13, will have hers soon.

'I had a recent case of a ten-month-old baby found dead in his cot by his sibling,' she says. 'He'd been examined thoroughly by his GP the night before and seemed OK. How many more parents need to wake up one morning and find their child dead before something is done?'
