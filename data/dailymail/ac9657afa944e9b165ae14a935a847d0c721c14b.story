Former BBC presenter Dan Penteado was jailed yesterday for pocketing £25,000 in benefits while he was being paid to track down cowboy traders on television.

Penteado, who admitted eight offences of dishonestly or knowingly claiming the benefits, was sentenced to 12 weeks.

The father of two, who co-hosts the Rogue Traders part of the show Watchdog, received £24,077 in housing benefit and £868 in council tax benefit while the BBC paid him £56,000 over four years.

Penteado, 40, who lives in a rented £375,000 townhouse in Bournemouth, was caught out when a council housing benefit officer recognised him on TV.

Sentencing, chairman of the bench John Corben told him: 'This is not a victimless crime, it is actually a crime of stealing from the public purse.' A tearful Penteado was escorted to the cells as his wife burst into tears.

His solicitor Terrence Scanlan told Bournemouth magistrates that Penteado was a man of good character but was 'sinking in debt' and owed £20,000 in student loans. He was only on short-term contracts with the BBC.

Portuguese-born Penteado, who also works as a private investigator,  had 'lost his burgeoning career in broadcasting', the solicitor added.

The court heard that Bournemouth council was seeking to recover all the cash and he had already paid back £280.

Today, the BBC confirmed the presenter is to be axed from the show following the case.

A BBC spokesman said: 'In light of the prosecution, Dan Penteado will not be returning to Rogue Traders.'

Scanlan said Penteado committed the fraud from 2008 to 2012 
because he was on a short-term contract with the BBC and made the 'very 
poor judgment not to interrupt the flow of housing benefit'.

Debt-ridden
Penteado was only caught when a council housing benefit officer 
recognised him on Rogue Traders and matched the name to his fraudulent 
application.

Chairman of 
the bench John Corben told Penteado, who is from Bournemouth: 'This is 
not a victimless crime, it is actually a crime of stealing from the 
public purse.

'It was 
planned over four years and it was calculated and we consider it so 
serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate - you knew exactly
what you were doing.

'You will be sentenced to 12 weeks in prison and it will not be suspended.'

His wife was in court and burst into tears as her husband was given a custodial sentence.

Earlier
in the hearing Mr Scanlan told the court that Portuguese-born Penteado 
was a man of good character but was 'sinking in debt' and owed £20,000.

Mr
Scanlan explained that Penteado first applied for benefit in 2007 when 
he was a student at Bournemouth University.

The solicitor said Penteado had 'lost his burgeoning career in broadcasting and that itself is quite a punishment for him'.

Earlier in the trial, the court heard how the offences went back to 2007 when Penteado filled out his first claim form
and failed to declare he had another bank account.

The court heard that Penteado repeated the fraud in subsequent years up to 2011.

In that time he failed to tell 
Bournemouth Borough Council he had been paid more than £56,000 for his 
work on Rogue Traders from 2008 to 2011.

Penteado appeared in court dressed in
trademark leathers and crash hemlet, ensuring he wasn't snapped by 
cameramen - a similar tactic used by many of the crooks he exposed.

Magistrates in Bournemouth were told 
that Penteado began claiming benefits in 2007 after he enrolled on as a 
full-time student at Bournemouth University.

He went to work for the BBC six months later on Rogue Traders but failed to disclose his earnings.

Johanne McNamara, prosecuting for Bournemouth Borough Council, said: 'The offences
came to light when a housing benefit officer recognised the defendant 
from the television programme Rogue Traders and recognised the name from
a form they had just processed.'

She outlined eight charges Penteado 
pleaded guilty to, explaining he received sums ranging from £16,000 and 
£18,000 from the BBC from April 2008 to December 2011.

He pocketed £24,077 in housing benefit and 868 pounds in council tax benefit.

Terrence Scanlan, defending, said: 
'Mr Penteado first obtained his claim for housing benefit in October 
2007 and at that point he was not working for the BBC.

'He had enrolled as a student as Bournemouth University trying to improve his prospects and was taking a degree course.

'He had no income and was relying on a student grant. His wife was not working and the family was struggling.

'In March 2008 the BBC contacted Mr 
Penteado and invited him to return to the programme that he had 
previously worked on; Rogue Traders.

'The BBC was going to recommission 
the programme and between March 2008 and December 2011 Mr Penteado had a
series of short-term contracts - not continuous employment.

'That uncertainty about his work raised a question mark that fed into his decision not to interrupt the flow of housing benefit.

'It was very poor judgement and the claim was wrongful for a period of four years.'

Mr Scanlan said the BBC paid him over £56,000, which worked out at about £14,000 a year.

He added: 'Throughout this period 
this was not a man living extravagantly, for most of the time he was a 
student and a family was living quite frugally.

'He has worked hard and always tried 
to improve his circumstances and always had the interest of his young 
family at heart. He is married with two children; twins aged nine.'

The presenter started working with Mr Allwright in 2001.

He is familiar to viewers of Watchdog as 
one half of the motorbike-riding team of investigators who chase down 
unscrupulous tradesmen and bring them to justice.

In the last series of Watchdog, the pair confronted eight business owners who they felt were ripping off the public.

Mr Scanlan told the court that as a 
result of the conviction, Pentreado's 'burgeoning career in 
broadcasting' was likely to have been scuppered.

He also said his client had £20,000 in debt from student loans and faced paying back £24,000 to the local council.

Penteado wore a white shirt, black tie and black jumper when he appeared in court today.

He looked pale and nervous and breathed deeply throughout the proceedings and at one stage wiped a tear away with a tissue.

Penteado lives in the leafy suburb of Westbourne in Bournemouth with his family.

The rented three-storey, terraced 
townhouse property is in a gated, private road, has a balcony on the 
first floor and is worth about £375,000.

Earlier, the court heard the council, which 
brought the prosecution, would be seeking to recover all the cash.

Councillor David Smith, from 
Bournemouth council, said: 'The amount of money stolen in this case is 
truly shocking. We are pleased that Mr Penteado has now been 
successfully prosecuted and brought to justice.

'The council will not tolerate 
benefit fraud. Anyone committing benefit fraud should expect to be 
investigated and action to be taken.'
