Forget the Scottish islands or Cornish coast, anyone searching for the good life need look no further than upmarket Surrey.

Those luckily enough to live in the county's exclusive Waverley area may be unsurprised to learn that they enjoy a better quality of life 
than any other rural area in Britain.

Waverley scored the highest in a newly-published comprehensive study, looking at a range of factors from health and prosperity to employment and weather.

The good life: The historic town of Godalming in Waverley, which was named as the rural area with the best quality of life

Peace and calm: The River Wey flows past Goldalming in Waverley on a sunny day in upmarket Surrey

Historic: Waverley Abbey near Farnham also attracts tourists to this upmarket part of the world

For example, people in Waverley earn 
more money, enjoy more sunshine and live longer than the national 
average, according to the report from the banking giant Halifax.

It is followed by Uttlesford in Essex, East Hertfordshire, Chiltern in Buckinghamshire and Maldon in Essex, which make up the remaining top five.

Waverley's towns of Godalming, Haslemere and Farnham have long attracted affluent commuters, wealthy families and celebrities.

The quiet towns, filled with historic architecture and independent businesses, are surrounded by picturesque villages, nestled among a walker's paradise of hills, woods and healthlands.

Perfect mix: Haslemere combines the peace and tranquility of the countryside with easy access to London

Home sweet home: Farnham in Surrey is another of Waverley's main towns, home to affluent commuters

Prestigious: Charterhouse School is one of the more expensive options for wealthy families in Waverley

Waverley's attractiveness has certainly not gone noticed by Hollywood location scouts.

Casino Royale, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, 
Robin Hood and Gladiator, are just a few of the blockbusters to be filmed there.

The council area is centred around 
Godalming, which has been dubbed 'Celebrity Central' because of the 
range of famous faces to have been spotted around the town over the 
years.

Penelope Keith, Chris Evans, Anthea 
Turner, Ringo Starr, Damon Hill and Eric Clapton are just a few to have 
called Godalming home.

Picturesque: The Old Barge pub in East Hertfordshire, which was named third in the list of top 50 rural areas

Catching some rays: Maldon in Essex not only made the top five in the quality of life study, it was second in the country for most sun

But the promise of easy access to 
London, just 30 miles away, coupled with the peace and tranquility of 
the great British countryside comes at a price.

Waverley covers a total area of and has a 133 square miles, with a population 121,800.

The local council, which was formed in 1974, is dominated by Conservative councillors.

Waverley Abbey, one of the area's most famous landmarks, is the earliest Cistercian monastery in Britain.

The borough is also known for its Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Blackheath Common.

The average property price is £325,034, which roughly double the national average.

Its main town, Goldaming, was the first in the country to have electric street lights in 1881.

The average property price in Waverley is £325,034 compared to a national average of around £162,000.

Councillor Robert Knowles, leader of Waverley Borough Council, described the area as 'truly a great place to live'.

He said: 'We take great pride in our 
borough and provide high standards of street cleaning which helps to 
make people feel good about living or visiting the borough.'

Godalming's other claims to fame include it being the first town in the world to have electric street lighting in 1881.

It is also where the celebrated professional relationship between architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and garden designer Gertrude Jekyll began.

Previous winners of the Halifax 
quality of rural survey, which it conducts every year, include East and 
South Cambridgeshire, Mid Suffolk and the Chilterns.

Quality: Wonersh is one of more than a dozen eclusive satellite villages surrounding Godalming

A rural local authority is defined as
 one in which the majority of residents live in towns or villages with a
 population of less than 10,000 people.

Rolling hills: Chiltern, Bucks, was named fourth for best quality of life

Topping its list of the best rural areas for sunshine is Shepway in Kent, which sees an average of 35.6 hours a week.

Maldon in Essex, which made the top five in the quality of life league, came second with 34.3 hours, followed by the New Forest.

But if its a job you are after, Suffolk Coastal has the highest percentage of adults in work at 85.8 per cent.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: 'Waverley has performed consistently strongly across a wide range of indicators for a number of years, and the latest survey found residents here now have the best quality of life in rural Britain.

'While Waverley is not the top area in any one indicator, its strength is that it performs strongly across the board.

'The average resident has a high weekly income, enjoys above average health and life expectancy and low crime rates.

'But while they also benefit from a big home with central heating, living there does not come with a hefty price tag, with house prices relative to earnings below the average for rural areas.

'It is the combination of factors taken together which ensure that residents in Waverley enjoy the highest standard of living in rural Britain.'
