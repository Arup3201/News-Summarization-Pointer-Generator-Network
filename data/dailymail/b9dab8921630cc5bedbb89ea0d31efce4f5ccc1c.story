Opinionated Apprentice finalist Luisa Zissman has angered grammatically astute Twitter users with her flagrant disregard for apostrophes, suggesting she will leave a crucial one out of her business logo because it looks better without.

The 26-year-old entrepreneur showed the social networking site a sneak preview of the new logo for her cooking business Baker's Toolkit, and one user pointed out Luisa - who had styled the logo 'Bakers Toolkit' - might need to rethink the grammar.

This prompted Luisa to ask whether or not the phrase needed an apostrophe - and if so, where - before deciding she didn't care as she preferred it without one.

The debate began when Luisa Zissman, left, tweeted a photograph of her new logo, right, for her company Baker's Toolkit

Opinion on the micro-blogging website was divided, with some people feeling she needed to pay more attention to the rules of the English language in order to be correctly understood, others remarking that hers is a baking company, not an educational one, and that brands such as Toys R Us get away with inaccurate logo phrasing.

The discussion became fairly heated, with aghast users spluttering comments such as 'You can't change English grammar even if it does look better on logos!' and 'I always cringe at businesses with bad grammar'.

Twitter was divided over whether or not Luisa should use the apostrophe in Baker's, while other users gave the Apprentice runner-up basic lessons in English grammar

Discussion
then followed among users about whether she meant Baker's (as in, the 
toolkit of one baker), or Bakers' (meaning the toolkit of all bakers).

Still
others pointed out that her comment had been a very clever marketing ploy, 
prompting discussion of her business all over Twitter and other media 
outlets.

Luisa narrowly
missed out on the £250,000 business investment by Lord Sugar to Dr Leah
Totton, who plans to use the money to open a plastic surgery chain.

Luisa wondered whether or not it would be terrible to stick with Bakers, and users pointed out that it would make people 'cringe'

Users pointed out that Baker's would be singular, Bakers' plural
