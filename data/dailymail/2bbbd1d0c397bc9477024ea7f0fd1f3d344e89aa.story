A nursing assistant who allegedly abducted University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been charged with her murder, according to reports on Monday.

Jesse Matthew, 33, was charged last year with the 18-year-old's abduction after she went missing on leaving a bar in Charlottesville, Virginia at 2am on September 13.

A month later, Miss Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave behind a rural property, around eight miles from where she vanished. Her death was declared a homicide in November.  

Albemarle County authorities will now reportedly charge Matthew with first-degree murder. A press conference is set for 11am on Tuesday.

In a statement, local authorities said on Monday that they would be making an announcement in the Jesse Matthew case at 11am and would not be providing any other information before hand.

However sources told local station CBS6 that Matthew is to be charged with first-degree murder.

Albemarle authorities refused to confirm reports of the murder charge ahead of the 11am press conference.

DNA has linked Matthew to the disappearance and death of UVA student Morgan Harrington in 2009, who vanished after attending a gig in Charlottesville

The location where Miss Graham's remains were found in Albemarle County is close to Matthew's mother former home. Matthew grew up in the area and is familiar with the surroundings.

Before Miss Graham disappeared, she texted a friend at 1am to tell them that she was lost.

She was last seen on surveillance footage from a downtown mall in Charlottesville. Matthew was also seen on this footage. 

On September 24, Matthew was charged with abduction with intent to defile after being picked up by police in Galveston, Texas, around 1,300 miles away. 

He was extradited to Virginia to face charges.  

Matthew is now suspected in a string of unsolved deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last decade.   

DNA evidence has also linked Matthew to the disappearance of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who vanished after attending a concert in Charlottesville in October 2009.

Her body was found a few months later, hidden at a remote farm. 

Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange County, Virginia in September 2010.

DaShad Laquinn Smith, also 19, disappeared on West Main Street in Charlottesville in November 2012.

As Matthew emerged as the main suspect in Miss Graham's disappearance, it was revealed that he had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. 

A sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University in Virginia on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus.

The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped.

He dropped out of Liberty University on the day the allegation was made. 

Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University in Virginia where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003.

Matthew has been linked to a string of young women's deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last ten years

Matthew's name has now been connected to the disappearances of DaShad Laquinn Smith, 19 (right), in November 2012 and Samantha Ann Clarke, 19 (left)  in September 2010. Both young women vanished in the Charlottesville area 

Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not clear how the second incident was resolved.  

Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005.

Mathew has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and sexual assault in that case.

In January, DNA testing cleared Matthew of involvement in the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, the 17-year-old Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found. 

Following Mathew's arrest in October, the attorney for Randy Allen Taylor - the man convicted of Miss Murphy's murder - requested that Matthew be properly examined as a possible suspect in the teen's death.
