Despite a Mayan prophecy, the world did not end on December 21 last year - but new evidence suggests the ancient civilisation's calendar system was, in other respects, accurate.

By re-analysing a wooden beam from a Guatemalan temple, originally radiocarbon-tested in 1960, scientists believe it shows the Maya culture did collapse a thousand years ago because it failed to cope with climate change - a proposition first suggested last year.

The Central American people had 
developed a sophisticated society, accurate calendars and complex 
architecture including pyramids.

They
thrived during rainy periods but a prolonged
drought somewhere between AD 800 and 1100 is said to have brought about its collapse.

For a long time, experts struggled to match dates from the Mayan Long Count calendar with the modern European calendar.

The Long Count system comprised 20-day cycles made up of k'in, which formed 360-day cycles known as tuns.

Another unit, b'ak'tun, represented a cycle of 400 years - and it was the ending of one of these that led to the belief of the apocalypse in 2012.

Now, archaeologist Douglas Kennett, from Pennsylvania State University, has applied modern carbon dating methods to a lintel, carved with historical records, found at Tikal, which was a major Mayan city, according to NBC News.

His aim was to confirm the accuracy of the dating: 50 years ago, other researchers at the university reckoned the beam had been carved between AD 695 and 712.

'When looking at how climate affects the
rise and fall of the Maya, I began to question how accurately the two 
calendars correlated using those methods,' Kennett said.

As well as using carbon isotopes to establish its age, he and his team looked at the tree rings in the wood.

The date they concluded was around AD 658-696, which backed up the original correlation estimates.

The two estimates match up even more closely after factoring in the removal of ten to 15 years of wood growth while the carving took place, the researchers said in the journal Scientific Reports.

The lintel they analysed concerned the defeat of Tick'aak K'ahk', king of the nearby city of Calakmul, by Tikal's leader Jasaw Chan K'awiil.

This is turned re-confirmed the theory that the victory was in AD 695, 13 years after Jasaw Chan K'awiil took to the throne.

Their report in the journal continued: 'These events and those recorded at cities throughout the Maya lowlands can now be harmonized with greater assurance to other environmental, climatic and archaeological datasets.'

Maya rulers commissioned monuments to record events

Rainfall and the 'war index' from Mayan times

In a project led by scientists from Pennsylvania State University and Zurich last year, with expert input from Durham University, precisely-dated rainfall records were made from deposits in local caves.

This was compared against a so-called 'war index', the dates of hostile events which Maya people recorded on stone monuments.

Researchers, who it is claimed have made a unique timeline linking changes in culture and climate, found war and unrest matched periods of drought.

Previously, when conditions were favourable with plentiful rain, the Maya civilisation expanded into large cities.

The findings, published in the journal Science, described how Maya rulers commissioned monuments to record events and the research team found the frequency of texts carved in stone indicating rivalry, war and alliances increased significantly between AD 660 and 900, during the drying trend.

At the time, Professor Kennett said: 'It is not just climate drying and drought that is important, but the preceding conditions that helped stimulate societal complexity and population expansion.

'This set the stage for societal stress and the fragmentation of political institutions later in time as conditions became drier.'

Precise rainfall figures were calculated from chemical analysis of stalagmites in the Yok Balum caves in Belize.

Dr James Baldini, of Durham University's Department of Earth Sciences, led the cave monitoring portion of the study.

He said: 'The rise and fall of Mayan civilisation is an example of a sophisticated civilisation failing to adapt successfully to climate change.

'Periods of high rainfall increased the productivity of Maya agricultural systems and led to a population boom and resource overexploitation.

'The progressively drier climate then led to political destabilisation and warfare as resources were depleted.

'After years of hardship, a nearly century-long drought from 1020 sealed the fate of the Classic Maya.'

The theory of climate change being to blame for the end of the Classic Maya civilisation has been suggested previously, but the link was controversial because of uncertainties over dating rainfall patterns.

The Classic Maya region covers portions of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras.

'Here you had an amazing state-level society that had created calendars, magnificent architecture, works of art, and was engaged in trade throughout Central America,' said UC Davis anthropology professor and co-author Bruce Winterhalder.

'They were incredible craftspersons, proficient in agriculture, statesmanship and warfare—and within about 80 years, it fell completely apart.

'It's a cautionary tale about how fragile our 
political structure might be.

'Are we in danger the same way the Classic 
Maya were in danger? I don't know.

'But I suspect that just before their 
rapid descent and disappearance, Maya political elites were quite 
confident about their achievements.'

Periods of high and increasing rainfall coincided with a rise in population and political centres between AD 300 and 660.

A climate reversal and drying trend between AD 660 and 1000 triggered political competition, increased warfare, overall sociopolitical instability, and finally, political collapse.

This was followed by an extended drought between AD 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures, death, famine, migration and, ultimately, the collapse of the Maya population.

Professor Kennett's research team collected a stalagmite from a cave in Belize, less than 1 mile from the Maya site of Uxbenka and about 18 miles from three other important centers.

Using oxygen isotope dating in 0.1mm increments along the length of the stalagmite, the scientists uncovered a physical record of rainfall over the past 2,000 years.

Combined, the stalagmite and hieroglyphs allowed the researchers to link precipitation to politics.
