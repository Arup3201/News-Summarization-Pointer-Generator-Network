The Stuxnet virus that last year damaged Iran¿s nuclear program was likely one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform whose roots trace back to 2007, according to new research from Russian computer security firm Kaspersky Lab

Online security experts Kaspersky Labs say that three hi-tech cyber weapons of the sort that damaged Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant may have been crafted in the same laboratory - and not yet released.

The viruses have never been seen 'in the wild' - and it's unclear whether they, like Stuxnet, would be built to cause failures at nuclear plants, or engineered for another purpose.

Security experts have detected the malicious software by 'keys' in Stuxnet itself, which appear to be looking for other 'family members' to communicate with.

Duqu - a 'trojan horse' program related to Stuxnet which was detected in industrial systems earlier this year, also searches for Stuxnet and Duqu-infected machines.

Duqu is designed to steal information which could be used in cyber attacks on industrial control systems. It's a 'scout' program that could be used in preparation for a crippling cyber attack.

Both appear to be searching for three other 'relatives' that have never yet been found.

The Stuxnet virus that last year damaged Iran’s nuclear program was likely one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform whose roots trace back to 2007, according to new research from Russian computer security firm Kaspersky Lab.   

Iran described Stuxnet - designed to cripple control systems in the nuclear plant - as 'lethal'.

Security experts widely believe that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, though the two nations have officially declined to comment on the matter.    

A Pentagon spokesman on Wednesday declined comment on Kaspersky’s research, which did not address who was behind Stuxnet.

Stuxnet has already been linked to another virus, the Duqu data-stealing trojan, but Kaspersky’s research suggests the cyber weapons program that targeted Iran may be far more sophisticated than previously known.  

Kaspersky’s director of global research & analysis, Costin Raiu, said that his team has gathered evidence that shows the same platform that was used to build Stuxnet and Duqu was also used to create at least three other pieces of malware.     

Raiu said the platform is comprised of a group of compatible software modules designed to fit together, each with different functions.

'It’s like a Lego set. You can assemble the components into anything: a robot or a house or a tank,' he said.   

More and more industrial equipment is connected to the internet - rendering it vulnerable to attacks by hackersKaspersky named the platform 'Tilded' after computer symbols appearing in file names.

Researchers with Kaspersky have not found any new types of malware built on the Tilded platform, Raiu said, but they are fairly certain that they exist because shared components of Stuxnet and Duqu appear to be searching for their kin.     

When a machine becomes infected with Duqu or Stuxnet, the programs search for two unique registry keys on the PC linked to Duqu and Stuxnet that are then used to load the main piece of malware onto the computer, he said.   

The nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, which was the target of the Stuxnet worm. The Duqu worm is similar but is designed to steal information rather than cause physical damage

Kaspersky recently discovered new shared components that search for at least three other unique registry keys, which suggests that the developers of Stuxnet and Duqu also built at least three other pieces of malware using the same platform, he added.   

Yet it would be relatively easy for the developers of those highly sophisticated viruses to create other weapons that can evade detection by those anti-virus programs by the modules in the Tilded platform, he said. 

Kaspersky believes that Tilded traces back to at least 2007 because specific code installed by Duqu was compiled from a device running a Windows operating system on Aug. 31, 2007.   

The 'Stuxnet' worm - a sophisticated cyber attack on the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran opened a new era of cyber-warfare. Duqu, detected in Europe, may well be from the 'same authors' says security firm Symantec

The Stuxnet attack on Iran's Bushehr 
nuclear plant - a computer 'worm' specifically written to attack 
industrial control systems - was proof that the software in many 
industrial plants was vulnerable to attack.

Since
then, there has been increased interest in the idea - both from 
researchers, and from potential attackers.

Relatively
unsophisticated 'computers' used to control industrial devices are 
'open' to the internet - leaving plants such as Busehr vulnerable to 
attack.

In theory, many plants - including utilities such as water and gas - are open to such attacks.

Earlier
this month, suspicions were raised about a remote attack on a water 
plant in America - but it proved to be an engineer accessing his work 
remotely.

But governments, 
including Britain's, are trying desperately to shield vulnerable 
utilities before someone deploys the next cyber weapon.
