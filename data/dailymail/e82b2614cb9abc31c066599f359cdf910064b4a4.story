A grocery store stocked entirely with goods made from felt is now open in Brighton.

The 'Cornershop' installation, brainchild of large-scale artist Lucy Sparrow, 29, is a life-size store, fully stocked with stitched-together goods.

Lucy, from Bath, spent seven months stitching together an incredible 3,994 grocery items, which required more than a quarter of a million stitches, and first unveiled her quirky shop in Bethnal Green, east London, back in August.

Artist Lucy Sparrow has created a Cornershop conraining almost 4,000 felt grocery items

Lucy said at the time: 'I've always made big things. I like coming up with huge projects where the result is bigger than me and it takes over my life. I'm very obsessive and I want that to come across in the work and get people thinking "Who would be crazy enough to do this?"

'I like getting up at the crack of dawn and beavering away at something, knowing that so many other people are still asleep. The felt shop was born out of a desire to make an exhibition that was so all-encompassing that when everyone came in they were just blown away by the extent of the work, the labour involved.'

Lucy took to crowdfunding site Kickstarter with the aim of raising £2,000 to create her corner shop - but ended up generating more than £10,500. She also managed to secure funding from the Arts Council - and a sponsorship deal with sweets manufacturer Swizzels.

The sewing enthusiast only began work on the shop in January 2014, and admits to occasionally feeling overwhelmed by the volume of produce she was committed to making.

She added: 'It was incredibly daunting. I remember planning out the making schedule at the beginning of February and it didn't allow for a rest until the October 1. There were so many nights where I would wake up in a cold sweat feeling guilty and panicked that I hadn't made enough that day.

'I fell asleep with pieces of half-stitched felt food a lot of the time. But I never felt like giving up, amazingly. However, there were periods of extreme fatigue where I just felt like I could sleep for weeks. I think I have multivitamins and takeaways to thank for getting everything completed.'

For most of the month of October, The Cornershop is stationed at the No Walls gallery in Brighton for one final seaside outing.

The felt versions of familiar grocery items include fish fingers, cans of SPAM and what is most certainly the softest loo roll ever manufactured.

Everything inside the Cornershop, including the till and the sandwich selection is fashioned from fabric

The pop-up shop features everything from huggable fruit, milk, biscuits, ready meals and squeezable confectionery to stitched felt newspapers, ice lollies and oven chips. 

And it's not only the goods on display, everything inside the Cornershop including the till, the functioning pricing gun, the contents of freezers and even the pick 'n' mix stand is fashioned from fabric. 

The majority of the contents have already been sold and are on loan for the duration of the Brighton show.

However, there is a handful of new, previously unseen items available to purchase, giving people one last chance to get their hands on some of Lucy's Cornershop goodies, with prices starting from just £30.

The Cornershop will be on display at the No Walls Gallery in Brighton from October 4 - 25. 

Even packets of cigarettes such as Lucky Strike and Mayfair Smooth are made of super soft fabric
