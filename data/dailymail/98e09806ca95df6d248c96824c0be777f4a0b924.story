Soloist: Samantha Stevenson, star of BBC Two series, The Choir, will be vying with the X Factor winner for the number one spot

An Army wife tipped to take the coveted Christmas number one spot with The Military Wives Choir was once so shy she would breakdown in tears at the mere thought of performing.

Samantha Stevenson, star of BBC Two series The Choir, spent years too afraid to sing in public after being turned away by a small church choir.

But now thanks to the show's choirmaster, Gareth Malone, and with support from family and friends she has finally conquered her debilitating phobia to take centre stage as a soloist on the choir's charity single, Wherever You Are.

The 28-year-old Scot, alongside her fellow military wives from the RMB Chivenor military base in Devon, is now vying for the Christmas number one with the annual crop of X Factor contestants.

And their bid to storm the charts is being backed by Radio 2 breakfast show host and One Show presenter Chris Evans who has launched a campaign to promote the single and get it to the top of the festive charts.

A Facebook page and a Twitter feed have also been set up to boost the single, which is raising money for the Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families 
Association.

Following the nationwide appeal William Hill reported the odds are now at 5-4 for the single to top the Christmas charts.

The choir of 100 military wives were brought together by singing tutor Gareth Malone 
for his popular The Choir series while their husbands were on deployment in Afghanistan.

The show tracked the group of shy, Devon-based wives, including Samantha, as they evolved into a pitch-perfect choir.

Samantha told the Telegraph: 'We knew people were going to 
watch the programme but we didn’t know how big it was going to be. Never
in a million years did we think people would be backing us for the 
Christmas number one. It’s wonderful.'

Samantha, currently based in Devon, joined a junior choir in 
Perth, Scotland from the ages 12 to 17 and was accepted to study 
music at Edinburgh University.

But she decided to give up her place when she met her husband, John, 28, who is now a Lance Corporal of the 24 Commando Regiment, Royal Engineers.

She said: 'I planned to go 
but then I got other priorities - I met my husband.

'I was 17, and when you’re that age 
you don’t think about careers, you just think, ‘I’ve got a boyfriend, 
that’s more important’.'

When she got married her dreams of singing were forgotten and her confidence was further shattered when a local church choir rejected her application as they deemed her voice 'too big'.

Then her husband left the family home for his first tour of duty in Afghanistan and she was left to bring up 
their two children, Elliv, 17 months, and Brodie, seven, who suffers 
from an autistic spectrum disorder.

She said: ‘When my husband went away, I had no confidence at all.

‘On my long list of priorities, I came at the very bottom. There wasn’t really any worth to me at all.’

But following her screen appearance the army wife has become a singing sensation and has regained her confidence.

In November she performed in front of the 
Royal Family along with an audience of 2.65 million viewers on national TV, for a Remembrance Day service at the Royal Albert Hall.

Samantha added: 'When I first joined Gareth’s 
choir, I thought it was fantastic but I still felt he was going to pick 
up on my voice and ask me to leave. I just had no self worth.

'Now people stop me in the street 
and say how fantastic the choir is - it’s quite overwhelming. And my 
husband says I’m a lot more confident than I was. He had never heard me 
sing properly until he watched the programme.'

The choir along with choirmaster Gareth Malone sang live on Radio 2 this morning on the Chris Evans show and are to sing live on the One Show this evening.

The Military Wives choir Christmas single - which is inspired by letters to their loved ones  - will be  released on December 19 and will be available for download from December 5.
