A New Zealand doctor has described the moment he fought off a shark with a knife which attacked him while he was spearfishing.

James Grant, 24, initially thought that a friend was tugging him on the leg as he swam in murky water near Colac Bay on the South Island.

But he quickly realised it was a shark and began stabbing it with knife he had in his hand.

'I looked behind to see who it was and got a bit of a shock,' Dr Grant told Radio New Zealand.

'I am not sure how effective (the knife) was. I guess it let go so something must have happened, put a few nicks in it.'

The creature retreated and he was able to swim to rocks. It was not until he removed his wetsuit that he released he had been bitten.

Dr Grant then calmly stitched up his wounds, which were up to 5cm long, using a first aid kit he kept in his vehicle for pig hunts.

He had signalled to his friends to indicate that he had been injured but they thought he was joking and kept fishing.

'I thought surely he hasn't been bitten, there's no way he has been bitten, he's got to be taking the p**s,' his friend Mackley Lindsay told stuff.co.nz.

When his friends got out of the water and saw his injuries they took Dr Grant to Colac Bay Tavern for a drink.

The pub proprietors also gave him a bandage because he was dripping blood on the floor.

Dr Grant was stitched up properly on Monday by his colleagues at Southland Hospital when he went back to work.

Sevengill shark: The creature Dr Grant believed attacked him

Although he did not see the creature, he believes it was a sevengill shark and about 20cm wide across the jaw.

Sevengills grow up to three metres long, and New Zealand is one of a few countries where they attack humans.

Attacks by the sevengill are relatively common around the Southland and Otago coast.
