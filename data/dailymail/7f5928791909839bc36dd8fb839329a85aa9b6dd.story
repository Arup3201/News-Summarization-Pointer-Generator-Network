Blame: Actress Penelope Keith has attacked women who get divorced later in life, saying they are to blame for pushing up house prices

As forthright Audrey Forbes-Hamilton in sitcom To The Manor Born, she was never afraid to speak her mind.

Yesterday actress Penelope Keith spoke out to defend her real-life ‘manor’ – taking aim at wind turbines, oligarchs and a generation of ‘silver splitters’.

She blamed a surge in divorces among baby boomer couples for driving up property prices in the Home Counties, as newly-single women in their 50s and 60s bought up flats and cottages.

And she lambasted developers who built ‘vast housing estates’ in her adopted county of Surrey, and the super-rich oligarchs who filled its skies with helicopter traffic.

Miss Keith, watched by millions in TV shows including The Good Life, gave a wide-ranging interview to Country Life magazine in which she said parts of  Surrey were under constant threat from developers.

The actress, 73, conceded that the county’s stockbroker-belt did need more affordable housing and appeared to blame baby boomer divorcees for driving up property prices.

She said: ‘I read about affordable houses that are £300,000. Sorry? Affordable for whom? It’s a terribly knotty problem.

‘If only we could educate people to go on living together for longer. It’s all these single dwellings, all these women in their 50s and 60s who suddenly want their own space, to be their own people. To do what?’

Figures have shown that divorces among couples of retirement age – dubbed the ‘silver splitters’ – have almost doubled in a decade, with the majority instigated by women.

The phenomenon has been blamed on increased life expectancy, better health and a greater ‘lust for life’ among the baby boomers compared with previous generations.

The comparative financial independence of women has also given them the freedom to leave their husbands – something earlier generations were less able to do. Actress Diana Quick was 61 when she separated from actor Bill Nighy last year, after a 28-year relationship.

Sympathy: Keith, who starred as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in To the Manor Born, has said she has no sympathy for women in their fifties who leave their husbands because they want 'their own space'

Marriage: Keith has been married to her husband Rodney Timson for over 30 years. She met the twice-divorced policeman, who is eight years her junior while appearing on stage in Chichester, West Sussex

At the time, she said: ‘There are far more couples splitting up in their 60s now and one reason is that they can. Economically, they have more independence.’ Property sales have been affected by the surge in later-life divorces and estate agents have warned of a shortage of smaller properties as more people choose to live alone.

In her interview, Miss Keith said London was now ‘too full’, placing increased demand on the surrounding Home Counties.

She said: ‘Vast housing estates built in the countryside remove the reason why people want to move to the country. If you want to embrace a culture, you can’t flood it, but it seems they will never build just a few houses in an area.’

Other threats to the Surrey countryside included helicopter traffic from the oligarchs who have bought gated mansions in St George’s Hill and Wentworth, she warned. Surrey is the richest county for property wealth and has become a magnet for Russian oligarchs and other ‘non-doms’.

Miss Keith, a former High Sheriff of Surrey who is involved with several charities and serves as one of the county’s deputy lieutenants, questioned if the new wealthy residents wanted to be part of the traditional community.

She said: ‘Everyone thinks you live among all these rich people, but you can’t get near any of that money… How do I let them know about battered wives, or my prison charity, or the school in India? I don’t think they want to know.’

Miss Keith continued: ‘There are wonderful places, such as the Surrey Hills… but if you’re vulnerable or on the lower echelons, it’s pretty bloody awful.’

She came to prominence with her portrayal of social-climbing Margot Leadbetter in The Good Life from 1975 to 1978, starring with Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington, and played lady of the manor Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in To The Manor Born, broadcast from 1979 to 1981.

Miss Keith lives in a village near Godalming with her husband of 36 years, ex-policeman Rodney Timson. The couple also have a home in the Scottish Highlands, and Miss Keith questioned the impact of wind turbines built in the area.

She said: ‘There are a hell of a lot of wind farms in the Highlands. Do they really produce that much energy? I can’t square the circle.

‘As you enter London, it says you’re entering a low-emission zone just as overhead come these great jumbos spewing out more gunge than I would in my entire life.’
