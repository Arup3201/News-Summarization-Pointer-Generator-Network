Each tweet may only contain 140 characters, but these short posts contain enough information to reveal hidden clues about your personality. 

A tool has been created that analyses the language used in up to 3,500 of these tweets posted by a user on the site.

From this it claims to be able to calculate how passionate, egoistical, materialistic and mischievous that particular user is.

The language you use on the social media site Twitter can provide an insight into your personality

According to a survey of 1,000 twitter users, around 72 per cent had one of these hidden personas.

A third of those who took part were found to have a passionate persona while 26 per cent were materialistic and 16 per cent were subconsciously egotistic.

Researchers have analysed exactly what makes a tweet get attention.

Cornell researchers say a combination of language, positive and negative words and even asking people to retweet help.

They say the results of the study, which was partly funded by Google, could not only improve your twitter performance, but also improve your chances in business meetings.

The researchers found nine key features most likely to generate retweets:

Dr Sandra Scott, a psychiatrist who has advised on Big Brother and I'm a Celebrity, developed the tool for red wine firm Apothic Wine.

She said: 'Most of us have some aspect of ourselves which we are not fully aware of, a sort of ‘hidden persona’.

'It is interesting to see how we can unconsciously reveal this part of ourselves through the use of social media.

'It’s worth noting that just because we are not fully aware of this aspect of ourselves does not necessarily mean that it is something to shy away from.

'Our 'hidden personas' can sometimes make us appreciate ourselves more and reveal qualities that we like.'

The test has also shown that Glasgow is home to the most egotistical people - 27 per cent, while Edinburgh has the most passionate Twitter users - 42 per cent.

Cardiff was found to be the least passionate and Brighton was the most materialistic.

Dr Scott said the tool could also help to reveal the kind of image that public figures and celebrities are presenting on Twitter.

She said: 'When you consider celebrities, prolific tweeters such as Jeremy Clarkson and Katie Hopkins, they, like all of us, are human beings.

The tool uses keywords on Twitter feeds to look for signs of four different personas like materialistic

Surprisingly egoists were not found to be the most common type of person sharing their thoughts on Twitter

'I think it is fair enough to say that all of us have a hidden side, we have an aspect of ourselves we are not conscious of.

'Celebrities, maybe more than most, have to be quite conscious about the image they are presenting on Twitter.

'Nonetheless, just like the rest of us, they will be revealing with every word something else they just don’t want to come out.'
