As if they don't get to enough on the red carpet, Halloween is always an excuse for Hollywood to strut their stuff and sex up their images with revealing and risque costumes.

And this year proved to be one of the most provocative, as the stars pulled out all the stops for their 'trick or tease' attires.

From Kim Kardashian's skeletal body suit to Kate Hudson's sexy biker and Lea Michele's naughty little red riding hood, it was all about the flesh.

But the one who managed to garner the most attention was Australian rapper Iggy Azalea who, after being compared to one of the cross-dressing characters of the film White Chicks by Snoop Dogg two weeks - sparking an onslaught of cyber bullying - decided to dress up as just that.

Tweeting a photo of herself as the character played by Marlon Wayans in the 2004 comedy, it was a playful shut down to all that had criticized her.

Halloween must come pretty easy to pop stars that have costume designers on-call at all times. 

Painted from head-to-toe in scales and green body paint, the singer gave her high-effort outfit a touch of sex appeal by baring her chest in a gold bralet.

She was recognizable from her fierce red lipstick but pulled a green wig of shiny locks off her face into a low ponytail.

The queen of Halloween, Heidi Klum, also opted for a costume not too far from the reptile world with an iridescent butterfly.

The star threw another of her famous scary season parties and could barely be recognized as the host in her brightly-colored costume.

In true Kardashian style, Kim made numerous outfit changes throughout the day on Friday.

She also opted for a funny costume, dressing as US Vogue Editor At Large Anna Wintour, whom Kim secured her first Vogue cover with this year.  

But it wasn't just the mum-of-one who was able to get into the spirit of the scary season this year.

Also leaving nothing to the imagination in her Halloween get up was actress Kate Hudson who threw a Sons Of Anarchy party in a leather crop top and hot pants.

She teamed up with 68-year-old mother Goldie Hawn who stuck on her leathers to show off her own flawless figure.

The pair added the sex appeal to the party, looking more like sisters than mother and daughter.

Being able to see the funnier side of dressing up, Katy Perry took the mickey out of herself when she attended Kate's bash in a Cheetos costume. 

In all-orange, Katy was a hard sight to miss, leaving just a face hole for her to see and be seen at the guest list only event in Brentwood.

Too complement her ensemble, but also make her costume identifiable, the singer carried a bag of Cheetos as a handbag too.
