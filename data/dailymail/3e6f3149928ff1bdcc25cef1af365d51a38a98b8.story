Police in Russia are hunting a babysitter who dumped a toddler in a hair salon after going in for an expensive cut.

Marina Kougadova, 24, was hired to look after two-year-old Lena Kouranova long-term after the child's mother Yulia got a new job.

Mrs Kouranova, 28, was offered the chance of a six-month contract in the tourism industry and was unable to take the girl with her.

But after taking the girl to a hairdressers in the city of Tolyatti in the south-western Russian province of Samara Oblast, Kougadova abandoned her and left without paying.

Hair salon owner Pelagia Yurieva said: 'The little girl sat there quietly while the woman who I thought was her mother was getting her hair done, and when it came to pay, she said she had forgotten her money in her car and would leave the girl with me while she went to collect it.

'It was really surreal when she didn't come back and at 9pm at night I was still sitting there with a girl.'

The hairdresser said she had not immediately called authorities as she kept expecting the customer to come back and could not work out what had happened to her.

But after two weeks of having her at the salon every day she had reported the matter to police, and social workers had taken the child into care.

The head of the custody and guardianship department of the Kirov district, Lyudmila Bobowa, said: 'She was brought to us without any identity papers and apart from her name, Lena, she wasn't able to tell us anything else.

'We immediately tried to find her relatives and to clarify the situation, but it was quickly clear that this wasn't going to go anywhere.

'It was only when we put out an appeal through the media including images that the girl's mother got in touch.

'This was seen by the girl's mother originally got in touch and told us she thought the child was safely with the babysitter.

'She said that she had regularly called the babysitter who had always pretended that the child was well. On the occasions when the mother asked to speak to her, the babysitter always said she was refusing to come to the phone or sleep, which she accepted because of her age.

'The girl is well-groomed, well-developed, and has honestly been looked after. She can even read nursery rhymes and speaks reasonably well for her age despite the fact that she didn't know any more than her first name.

'Our impression was that she was from a good family so we couldn't understand how it was that her mother at abandoned her. The fact that it was apparently the babysitter helps to explain a lot.'

The child's mother now faces an agonising wait to make sure that she can have her daughter back after it was revealed officials had already started the proceedings of giving the child out for adoption, and they now need it to consider the application for the mother to have her daughter back.

Bobowa said: 'It will probably be okay for to have her daughter back but we still need to go through the paperwork and process a formal application.'
