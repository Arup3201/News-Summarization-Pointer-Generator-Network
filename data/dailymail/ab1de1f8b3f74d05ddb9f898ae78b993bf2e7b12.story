This tiny koala has spent the past six months tucked up cosy and warm in its mum’s pouch.

And as it poked its sleepy head out, the joey seemed reluctant to venture much further into the chill Edinburgh air.

Britain’s first-ever joey, which was born at the city’s zoo in May, emerged fully from the pouch of his mother Alinga for the first time at the weekend.

Alinga, the joey's mother, aged two, became the zoo's first female koala when she arrived in February

Its sex has not yet been determined by its keepers.

Zoo spokesman Lorna Hughes said: ‘A lot of people expected the joey to just suddenly appear one day but the process has been more gradual.

‘The first thing we saw was a pink arm poking out, with no fur. Now the whole joey is starting to come out and we can see it has developed a beautiful grey fur coat.’

Born blind with no ears or fur, it has spent the past six months developing in Alinga's pouch.

After growing almost all of its fur, the creature recently became active at night and started climbing on its mother's back.

Zoo keepers monitored the youngster's late night activity on CCTV but excited zoo visitors were limited to the odd glimpse of a nose or arm.

The joey finally emerged in daylight for the first time on Sunday and is now set to be a star attraction at the zoo.

Koalas are marsupials native to the southern and eastern coasts of Australia and Edinburgh is the only British zoo housing any.

Alinga, aged two, became the zoo's first female koala when she arrived in February.

She fell pregnant during her first introduction to male Goonaroo.

The zoo's head of living collections, Darren McGarry, said: ‘As koalas are solitary animals, bringing them together for mating required a lot of skill.

‘So for Alinga to breed successfully, on the first attempt is a great accomplishment for the team.

‘We have worked with koalas for eight years now and everybody is completed devoted to their care.

‘Each of our three adult koalas - Alinga, Goonaroo and Yabbra - have very distinct characters and we cannot wait to see what sort of character our little joey has.’

Alinga will carry the joey on her back until it is aged around one.

When it reaches sexual maturity at around two, the joey will begin a breeding programme.

If it is female it may stay at Edinburgh Zoo to breed with male Yabbra. But if it is male it will be moved elsewhere in Europe.

Edinburgh Zoo has been part of the European breeding programme for koalas for eight years.

Despite being one of Australia's most iconic animals, koala numbers are in decline in the country due to habitat loss.

A koala's diet consists solely of Eucalyptus leaves, a plant that is toxic to most other animals.

The Edinburgh Zoo koalas receive a wide variety of Eucalyptus species fresh every day.
