What with missing screws, fiddly flat packs and baffling instructions, shopping at Ikea can be a stressful experience.

And if all that isn’t enough to raise your heart rate, it has now emerged that UK customers are paying up to three times as much for the privilege as our foreign counterparts.

The Swedish company has been accused of charging British buyers more than consumers in the US and Europe for its products.

Rip off: Ikea are charging UK customers up to four times as much as those in the US and Sweden 

At the cheaper end of its range, a £5 Knalla bag costs the equivalent of just £1.61 in the US, while one of its £100 swivel chairs here can be bought for £59 in America.

And a collection of ten popular products is said to cost £500 more here than the items would across the Atlantic – where Ikea is even cheaper than in its home country.

It has previously been argued that prices for Ikea products are steeper in the UK because the cost of doing business is higher in this country.

Marketing experts have also suggested that the British welfare state props up prices because it guarantees a certain level of income – which means retailers can get away with charging more in the UK than in other nations.

Yesterday, a spokesman for the firm, which has 338 stores in 40 countries – including 18 in the UK – said prices were affected by a range of factors specific to each nation.

Emily Birkin, UK sales manager for Ikea, said: ‘Low price is the cornerstone of the Ikea vision – and we will always remain focused on giving our customers the best value for money.

Price gap: A Hemnes TV storage combination costs £649 in UK stores, but only £473 on the other side of the Atlantic

‘Prices are subject to a number of factors in every country such as exchange rates, VAT, corporation taxes, wages, energy prices and transportation costs.

‘All of these factors have an impact on the total cost. We always aim to give customers in the UK the lowest price for comparable products sold by any competitor.’

However Marc Gander, from the Consumer Action Group, said he believed British shoppers were being treated like Ikea’s ‘cash cows’.

He added: ‘Ikea are making tweaks and changes in their approach which mean they can bang the prices up for British consumers. 

They are doing it for their shareholders, but it means British customers pay the price.’

Cheaper stateside: A Skurvsta chair (left) will set you back £59 in the US, almost double (£109) what it costs in the UK. An Adde chair (right) is £10 in the UK but only £7.67 in American stores

A Falster garden set is £315 in UK shops - £102 more expensive than their US counterparts and £100 more than in Sweden

Last month it emerged that British shoppers were paying hundreds of pounds more for TVs, computers and tablets compared to consumers across the Atlantic. 

Research by Which? discovered that a top-of-the-range Samsung TV costs £755 more in the UK than in the US.

An Apple MacBook Pro 13in laptop was £355 more expensive here, while the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games consoles cost £95 more when they were bought in Britain.

The survey revealed that global electronics giants see the UK as a ‘treasure island’ where they can charge higher prices for everyday items because various taxes and hurdles erected by the Government mean shoppers are unable to save money when they buy American goods online.
