The Prince of Wales was surrounded by people congratulating him on the birth of his first grandson as he attended the polo today.

Hundreds of people swarmed around the Prince when he went onto the field at half time during the Westchester Cup, the sport's answer to the Ryder Cup.

He shook the hands of several spectators who came forward to congratulate him on the birth of Prince George of Cambridge, when he joined them for the tradition of going onto the field of play to stamp down divots made by the horses.

An area was roped off in front of the royal pavilion at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park, on the border of Berkshire and Surrey, where he had previously watched the first three chukkas between England and the United States.

But in a surprise move, Charles stepped over it and walked into the crowds, flanked by his security guards, for a walkabout.

Kevin Newberry, 36, from Oxford, was one of those who shook hands with the Prince.

Charles stepped over the rope separating the royal party from the crowds and walked into the crowds, flanked by his security guards. He shook hands with Philip Day from Binfield, Berkshire

'I just went up to him and said "Congratulations", and he replied "thank you very much",' he said.

Joining Charles in the Royal pavilion at the game were celebrities including Star Trek actress Alice Eve, Strictly Come Dancing's Brendan Cole, Life on Mars stars John Simm and Philip Glennister, and television presenter and former England rugby union scrum half Matt Dawson.

Charles presented the Westchester Cup, the sport's oldest trophy, to the England team after they beat the United States 12-11 in the first chukka of extra time.

It was the first time the competition had been held in England since 1997, but the hosts were the holders, having beaten the Americans the last time they met in 2009.

David Wood, the chief executive of the Hurlingham Polo Association (HPA), said they had been pre-warned that Charles was planning to go walkabout on the field of play at half-time.

'I think everyone here is thrilled, they are great supporters of him and the family,' he said.

'I think they are all delighted, it's great news.

'I hope he's a polo player when he grows up, I'm sure he will be.'

The four-man England team included Mark Tomlinson, who plays polo with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

William and the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge attended his wedding to London Olympics dressage gold medallist Laura Bechtolsheimer in the Swiss Alps in March.

After the game, Mr Tomlinson said he had joked with Charles about the baby's arrival and how his friends were dealing with parenthood.

'I asked how the new dad was doing and whether he had changed any nappies yet,' he said.

'He (Charles) is very proud.'

Pressed on what reply he got to his question about nappies, he laughed and said: 'Not yet I don't think.'

He described the English victory as 'a great moment' and joked that it was good that unlike the England football team, they had not had to try to win on penalties.

The event also attracted a whole host of A-listers in the form of Zoe Saldana, Eddie Redmayne and Naomie Harris, who were all spotted mingling in the Boujis Tent, sponsored by Belvedere Vodka.
