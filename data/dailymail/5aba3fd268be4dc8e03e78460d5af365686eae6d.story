The Obama administration went into bunker mode on Tuesday after news leaked that the president had selected former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as his next Pentagon chief.

An Italian Internet hoaxer created a fake Twitter account in Carter's name Tuesday morning and tweeted that he had gotten the job. And two major news outlets claimed to have inside information that the Carter pick was a done deal.

But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was tight-lipped in his press briefing.

'What I can tell you is – not much,' he told reporters. 'Mr. Carter is obviously somebody who has generated a lot of headlines today.'

Earnest said Carter 'certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government,' but insisted, 'I don't have any additional insight to share with you.' 

A White House official had told MailOnline earlier in the day that 'we are not in a position to confirm the personnel rumors, sorry.'

Bunker mentality: Josh Earnest wouldn't confirm anything about a Pentagon pick on Tuesday

An Italian journalist created a fake Twitter account in the name of likely US Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter on Tuesday, fooling reporters and bringing a torrent of phone calls to the White House and the Pentagon

SECRETARY-IN-WAITING: Former Deputy Decretary Ashton Carter is the likely Hagel replacement

Speculation ran rampant all day that Carter, a former Pentagon official who left the Obama administration in 2013, would be the president's pick. But Italian journalist and schoolteacher Tommasso Debenedetti had everyone fooled into thinking Carter had publicly confirmed the rumor.

'President Obama phones me announcing his decision to appoint me as Defense Secretary. I'm honoured and happy,' read a tweet from an account in Ashton's name, created Tuesday morning. 

The British spelling set off digital speculation, however, and Debenedetti admitted his ruse an hour later.

Debenedetti is known for impersonating famous figures on Twitter, including author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

He has also fooled Italian newspapers into publishing phony interviews he claimed to have conducted with authors John Grisham, Arthur Miller, Gore Vidal, Toni Morrison, Derek Walcott and Philip Roth.

Nevertheless, CNN and Bloomberg both reported that Obama would name Carter – the real one – to succeed outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Carter, a former deputy secretary at the Department of
Defense who has never served in the active military, had been considered a leading candidate for the job to
replace Chuck Hagel, who is resigning.

Other front-runners, however, had already said they didn't want the thankless job. 

Michèle Flournoy, who was poised to become the first female Pentagon chief, pulled out last week. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed followed suit days later.

A Pentagon spokesman told Reuters that he was unaware of a decision to name Carter to the post, and
referred reporters to the White House, which had no immediate
comment. A spokeswoman for Carter also had no
immediate comment.

Other names have been circulated as a possible replacement
for Hagel, including former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig and
Kurt Campbell, a former Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs who now heads the Asia Group, a
strategy and capitol advisory group.

Obama said last week that the ousted Hagel, the only Republican in his cabinet, was an 'exemplary' Defense Secretary and 'is and has been a great friend of mine' since he was a 'green behind the ears senator' serving on the Foreign Relations Committee

Hagel was the first enlisted combat veteran to lead the Department of Defense but earned very little support from his fellow Republicans in the US Senate

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, a former general
counsel at the Pentagon who had been believed to be under active
consideration, also took himself out of consideration, according to a
source familiar with the situation.

Carter was the No. 2 official at the Pentagon from October
2011 to December 2013. Previously, he was the Pentagon's chief
arms buyer.

He also served as assistant secretary of defense for
international security policy under President Bill Clinton.

Carter has bachelor's degrees in physics and medieval
history from Yale, a doctorate in theoretical physics from
Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, according to
the Pentagon's website.

Carter's academic record brought Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to joke at Carter's farewell ceremony in 2013 that he has been called an 'uber-wonk' and that in Hollywood circles he would be considered 'not hot.' 

But Dempsey said Carter had earned respect far and wide.

'It's lucky for us that you have worked without glamour or fame behind the scenes to make sure through good management and common sense and discipline that we are an organization that continues to adapt to the challenge that we find in front of us,' Dempsey said then.

'He did it all again without fanfare. In fact, I think he's been called the most important, least known figure in Washington, or some language to that effect, and I agree with that.' 

Hagel resigned under pressure last week after less than two
years at the helm of the Defense Department.
