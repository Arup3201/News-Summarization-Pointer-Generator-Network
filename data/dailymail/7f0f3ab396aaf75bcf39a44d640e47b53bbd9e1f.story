The Duchess of Cornwall stopped to pose for a selfie with a 13-year-old boy during a tour of an arthritis centre in London today.

Danny Roberts, from Maida Vale, is currently being treated for the illness but was delighted when he received a bedside visit from Camilla.

Speaking afterwards, the teenager said the Duchess had been 'really concerned' and added that it was 'very nice of her' to come and visit.

'It was fantastic to meet the Duchess of Cornwall,' he said. 'She was really interested in why I’m at University College Hospital and wanted to find out more about how I’m being treated. 

'It was really nice of her to come and see us and be so concerned.'

The Arthritis UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology is the first in the world to be dedicated to understanding how and why arthritis affects teenagers.

During the visit, the Duchess was shown immune cells in a microscope, which were there as part of a project working out how puberty and stress can affect the immune system.

 Speaking after the visit, Dr. Liam O’Toole, CEO of Arthritis Research UK said that the findings being made at the centre are helping to improve the wellbeing of arthritic teens across the country.

'Having arthritis at any time in your life is difficult but having arthritis as a teenager is particularly challenging,' he said.

Important work: The Duchess of Cornwall was shown some immune cells under a microscope

'The daily pain can have a massive impact on a young person’s appearance, social life and education. 

'The research at the centre is focused on improving the health and wellbeing of these young people living with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases

'We were thrilled that we were able to showcase examples of our research at the Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology to the Duchess of Cornwall. 

'Her Royal Highness was shown research looking at how puberty and stress can impact a teenager’s immune system, as well as practical technological solutions being developed to help young people better manage their condition.'

The visit came hot on the heels of a trip to a school, where Camilla told a class of children that they were being 'very brave' as they read a scene from Shakespeare's As You Like It in front of her.

Impressed: The Duchess was left impressed by the literary efforts of the children at Holland Park School

The Duchess, who was on elegant form in a tailored black jacket and a flared grey skirt, was visiting Holland Park School in West London to present a creative writing prize to one of the children.

Mukahang Limbu, who received a certificate from the Duchess, had taken part in a competition run by charity First Story, of which Camilla is patron.

The charity aims to inspire more children to write by sending authors into schools, among them Scottish writer Kate Clanchy, who was at the school when the Duchess arrived.

Touring the school, Camilla was shown into several classes, including Latin, History, English and one of the science labs.

While in the English lesson, she chatted to 14-year-old Annise Afflick from Fulham who showed the Duchess a monologue she had written based on Shakespeare's As You Like It.

After hearing the class read some of the play, Camilla smiled and said: 'I'm very impressed by you all; you're very brave to read it all out loud! There's real talent here.'

Later, while presenting Mukahang Limbu with his prize during a specially convened assemby, the Duchess spoke of her hope that a literary talent of the future would be found in the school.

'I hope that looking at all of you here today there may be sitting amongst you some of the great writers of the future,' she said. 

The Duchess of Cornwall is in the middle of a busy schedule of engagements and spent yesterday afternoon meeting men from the 4 Rifles and their families, before continuing on to a gala dinner thrown by the National Literacy Trust. 

Camilla, who who has been Patron of the National Literacy Trust since 2010, was greeted by Dame Julia Cleverdon, Chair of the National Literacy Trust and spent time chatting with the charity’s author ambassadors.

Among them are Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman, Joanna Trollope, Lauren Child, Cressida Cowell, Charlie Higson, Anthony Horowitz, Axel Scheffler, Antony Beevor, Philip Hensher, Victoria Hislop and Neel Mukherjee. 

Luke Kelly, Roald Dahl’s grandson and managing director of the Roald Dahl Estate, and Lady Mary Wellesley were also introduced to the Duchess.
