The Liverpool fan who held back Mario Balotelli at Anfield on Sunday has revealed he feared the Italian striker was going to follow Steven Gerrard into the home dressing room for an early bath.

Shaun Leatherbarrow, who sits on the first row of the Centenary Stand, was among a handful of supporters who decided to restrain the 24-year-old following a collision with Chris Smalling.

Balotelli, who was already on a yellow card, looked as if he was going to confront the Manchester United defender until fans stepped in to calm the former Manchester City star down.

The duo competed for the ball and momentum appeared to take them into the advertising boards 

Mr Leatherbarrow told the Liverpool Echo: 'The way I saw it Smalling sort of shoved Mario off the pitch and Mario grabbed him just to have something to grab on to.

'I could tell from Mario’s body language he was ready to react and I knew he’d already had a yellow card.

'I was saying "calm down, leave it, leave it and he was saying ‘OK, OK". I’m only 5ft 8in and he’s a big lad so I was struggling to get my arms around him.

'Peter, the lad who sits next to me at the ground, helped me and he’s a police officer who sometimes works at Anfield on match days.

'Afterwards all the lads were laughing and patting me on the back as well as having a go at Smalling.'
