The change in weather has led to a significant rise in the amount of people visiting their GP with hay fever complaints

The recent warm weather snap has seen a massive rise in the number of hay fever complaints.

The number of suffers visiting GP surgeries in England and Wales during the week before last stood at 11,873 compared to 5,560 in the same period last year, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said.

The college said the number of cases in the last fortnight had increased five-fold compared with the start of this month.

Experts 
have already warned that the condition is set to strike thousands more 
older people - even those who were never sufferers in the past.

Late-onset
 hay fever affects people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and older, and can be 
triggered by pollution, stress and even moving home.

These
 triggers can cause symptoms in people with a genetic predisposition to 
hay fever whose immune systems have reached a ‘tipping point’.

Professor
 Jean Emberlin, scientific director of the charity Allergy UK, said: 
‘They have to become sensitised and more people will reach this 
threshold because of the interaction between pollen and traffic 
pollution.'

Hayfever is caused by allergy to pollens and symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes. Sometimes the sinuses and throat can be affected.

Children aged five to 14 years are most affected, followed by people aged between 15 and 24 years old.

Maureen Baker, chair of the RCGP, said: 'Each year, seasonal hay fever causes untold misery to thousands of people across the country, especially when we all want to enjoy the warm weather.

'Hay fever is awful but the discomfort should only be temporary and there should be no long-term effects.

High pollen count: The number of hay fever sufferers in this country increases every year

'Whilst in some cases it may be necessary to see a doctor, especially if the symptoms persist, there are many anti-histamine medications that can be bought over the counter at your pharmacist that should provide effective relief.

'Patients that suffer from hay fever can also take simple steps to help minimise their exposure to pollen, such as wearing a hat with a wide brim and sunglasses, and applying Vaseline to nostrils to help trap pollen particles.'

Up to 18 million Britons suffer hay fever, with their numbers increasing by almost one per cent a year.
