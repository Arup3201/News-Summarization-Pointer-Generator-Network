If you would expect to see Mark Zuckerberg anywhere, it would most likely be huddled over a laptop untangling an advanced algorithm in a bid to make his next billion.

But this computer geek has a secret wild side... and loves nothing more than wind in his hair, seawater on his face and a paddle board beneath his feet.

Indeed, the 28-year-old Facebook founder likes it so much that he had to show wife Priscilla how good it feels yesterday, as he took her out to sea to try it out in Hawaii.

The couple were photographed trudging wearily up the beach after a hard afternoon of sun, sea and surf, both grimacing under the weight of their massive boards.

But while Priscilla embraced the rays in a bikini, Zuckerberg, famed for his unambitious wardrobe, opted to keep his t-shirt firmly on. It was black to match his shorts and sandals.

Zuckerberg has been enjoying a no-frills holiday in Kauai with his Harvard-educated doctor wife on their latest trip to Hawaii, where they are rumoured to be on a reconnaissance trip for real estate on the island.

But despite being worth $13.3billion, Zuckerberg has been at pains to focus on the simple things in life rather than indulging in lavish dinners and extravagant outings.

A day earlier they were seen chatting with friends at picnic tables while snacking on Kauai's famous Bubba burgers and smoothies.

The couple, who are notoriously down-to-earth, sported casual wear and Mark wore his now-famous sandals, which are parodied by Jesse Eisenberg in the film about Facebook, The Social Network.

The billionaire formerly said he would only eat meat he killed himself, but it appears he makes an exception when he's on holiday

'We try to stick pretty close to what our goals are and what we believe 
and what we enjoy doing in life - just simple things,' Chan has previously told The New 
Yorker.

As the couple headed to their beach front house, they were seen walking past Shave Ice Paradise - a favorite of the Obama family when the First Family vacations in Hawaii.

It is just the latest trip to Hawaii for Zuckerberg and Chan, who switched web surfing for wave surfing in Maui last December. They were seen chatting with beach goers and enjoying lessons in the water.

And while the couple do not appear to be splashing out this trip, it was reported that Zuckerberg did go on a spending spree in the area in January, when he bought several luxury condos in Honolulu.

He was reportedly interested in buying 
several units in a 23-story ultra-luxury condominium under development. 
Each unit costs $1.6 million - with penthouse suites reaching $9 
million.

The couple met at a college party in 2003 as they stood in line for the bathroom at Zuckerberg's Jewish fraternity at Harvard University, Alpha Epsilon Pi.

'He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there,' Chan told the New Yorker.

They married in May last year in Zuckerberg's backyard in Palo Alto, California - after telling their unwitting guests the celebration was solely to mark Chan's graduation from medical school.

As well as family and friends, they were joined by their dog Beast and serenaded by Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong.

While the couple were seen taking it 
easy in Kauai, where they are staying at a beach house, the Winklevoss 
twins - who sued Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing their idea to create 
Facebook - were seen partying with women at the Coachella music festival
in California.

Zuckerberg was no doubt ready for a holiday following his first foray into politics this month.

With other Silicon Valley leaders, he
launched a political group aimed at revamping immigration policy, 
boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research.

Zuckerberg announced the formation of Fwd.us (pronounced 'forward us') in an op-ed article in The Washington Post two weeks ago.

In
it, he said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to 
get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, 
skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.'
