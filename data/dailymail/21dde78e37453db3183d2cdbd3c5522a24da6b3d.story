Officials say a 5-year-old boy was taken to a hospital after a 30-foot fall from a chair lift at a Philadelphia-area ski lodge.

The accident was reported at about 7 p.m. Saturday at Spring Mountain Adventures in Schwenksville, Montgomery County.

Owner Rick Buckman said the boy was riding unsupervised on a beginner chair lift and wearing a helmet when he fell to the slope below.

Eyewitnesses said the boy's right leg was badly hurt and he had a small laceration on his chin

He was flown to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where officials declined comment on his condition.

A ski instructor told WCAU-TV that he seemed conscious and alert when medics arrived.

Buckman said he was told that the child had a cut on his face and ski patrol members suspected a leg injury.

He said there was no chair or lift malfunction.

'Lucky, he was wearing a helmet,' Buckman said. 'Ski patrol said that he was conscious the whole time.

The boy was flown to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where officials declined comment on his condition.

'He must’ve slipped under the restraint bar, he added. 'We’re investigating it right now, but the child said that the restraint bar was down," he said. "We are concerned about the child’s condition.'

Buckman said the ride operates without restriction on age or heir and there are no plans to add any. 

Eyewitness Noah Phifer said he saw the accident and went to check on the boy.

'He said that his right leg hurt pretty bad,' Phifer told NBC DFW. 'He also said his neck hurt and he also had a small laceration on his chin.'
