The devastated parents of a popular schoolboy found hanged in his bedroom told an inquest they believed his death could have been an April Fool prank gone wrong.

Talented Lance Bassett, 15, from Hastings, East Sussex, was a keen practical joker and seemed perfectly happy on the evening of his death on March 31 this year, they said.

In a statement read at the inquest in Hastings, his mother, Ann Bassett, 47, said she thought at first he had set up an elaborate hoax when she discovered him hanging in his room.

Suicide riddle: Recording an open verdict, Coroner Alan Craze said nobody would ever know if Lance Bassett, pictured, meant to kill himself

She said: 'I am more and more of the 
opinion that it is at least a possibility that this terrible tragedy was
a practical run-through for an April Fool's prank that had gone 
terribly, terribly wrong.

'He
just had to get out of bed to set up the prank. It would not have been a
particularly funny prank, but it just doesn't make sense to us, knowing
what we do of his character, that he would take his own life.

'Knowing him as we did we know that his character did not match someone who would commit suicide.'

She said she even believed the apparent suicide note he left was tongue in cheek because of its teasing tone.

She said: 'He used the word 'dang'. He knew his father hates the word 'dang'. With his meticulous eye to the planning of his jokes he would have known this would have wound him up.

'Of course, we're aware that this interpretation could be wrong. It is possible that we just cannot come to terms with the fact he killed himself.

'We're trying to come to terms with the fact that we shall never know which of these these scenarios is correct.'

Mrs Bassett said her son had been doing his maths homework in his bedroom upstairs when she went to his room to ask him to come down for supper.

Practical joker: Lance Bassett was found 
hanging in his bedroom. His parents think it was a prank that went wrong

She said: 'My first reaction when I saw him was that he was teasing and to tell him to stop it.

'I said 'Stop it, come on.' Then I touched him and it was clear from the movement of his body this was not a prank.'

She said she had spoken to all Lance's friends and teachers at his school, Claverham Community College in Battle, and they all agreed he had never showed any signs of distress or depression before his death.

She said: 'We had several visits from his school friends and they all found it hard to believe that he had taken this action himself.

'He had been exactly the same when he left them that day as he normally was. He had been laughing, joking and happy.

'His teacher said there was nothing different about him that day.'

On the way home from school, she said Lance asked her advice about how to ask a girl out on a date without losing face, and said he was looking forward to a school fancy dress party.

Recording an open verdict, Coroner Alan Craze said nobody would ever know if Lance meant to kill himself.

He said: 'I'm left in exactly the same position as his parents, which is to take note of the evidence and to try to decide whether his death came about as a result of a definite attempt to end his life.

'I believe this was a probable suicide but not a proven suicide.

'As a father of a young daughter of about the same age, I can't begin to imagine what you as a family have gone through. You have all my sympathy.'

Speaking after the inquest, Lance's father Nigel, 49, an osteopath, said: 'We'll never know for sure why he did it. He was a cheerful guy with loads of friends.

'He was always very open with his emotions, and he didn't seem unhappy at all in the days before he died.

'We will miss him forever.'

Almost 2,000 people joined a Facebook tribute page which shows poignant videos of the teenager snowboarding, sitting on a beach and one of him and two friends giggling as they performed a choreographed dance routine which they put on YouTube.

One friend wrote: 'Out of the 6,000 million people on the earth, you deserved to die least. You will be missed by us forever. If only you knew how much we cared.'

Another wrote: 'Everyone was shocked finding out, if only you could see. You should have been out partying with all your mates leaving school, having fun.'

'We really miss you Lance and we wish we could share school memories with you in 50 yrs time rest in peace and sleep tight Lance.'

Lance's headmaster Paul Swatton said: 'Everyone at Claverham Community College has been extremely shocked and saddened.

'He was an intelligent young man who was working towards his GCSEs and had a very bright future ahead of him.

'He played a full and active part in school life and was well liked by staff and pupils.'
