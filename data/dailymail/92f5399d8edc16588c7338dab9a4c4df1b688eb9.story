An oil tycoon who owes his ex-wife £17.5 million after a divorce battle has been told to hand over £20,000 or have his appeal against an order to pay her £400,000 thrown out.

Michael Prest was warned to pay the cash within 28 days or face having the appeal against paying his ex-wife Yasmin or going to jail, dismissed.

At the High Court Family Division, senior appeal court judge Lady Justice Gloster, said the 52-year-old continued to live a 'lavish lifestyle' and 'clearly has the ability to pay'.

His ex-wife, 51, had asked the judge to make the order for £20,000 security of her costs for the forthcoming appeal. 

It was said that she made the order given his failure to pay other money in the long running dispute, which has now topped £1million. 

At a previous hearing, Mr Justice Moylan said he was satisfied Mr Prest had the means to give the £270,000 a year he was ordered to pay his ex-wife along with the £24,000 a year for their four children.

But because he has 'willfully refused' to hand over the money and was in contempt, he was told he must pay the £360,000 he still owes plus £40,000 towards his wife's £82,000 legal costs within three months, or go to jail for four weeks. 

The deadline of paying the cash by October 28 has been extended pending his appeal, which Lady Justice Gloster said would be dismissed if he did not lodge the £20,000 in time.

In June last year, Mrs Prest won a landmark Supreme Court battle for her rightful half share of his multi million pound fortune - put 'conservatively' at £37.5m.

But he has failed to pay a penny of the £17.5 million ordered by the court.

Mr Prest had been living as a tax exile in Monaco, but Lady Justice Gloster was told he has had to give up his flat there and now gave his address as Nigeria.

Despite claiming poverty the judge said he still had a home in the West Indies and she had evidence of his lavish lifestyle with skiing holidays and funding expensive litigation in the Isle of Man.

She said his 'lifestyle continues to be extravagant' and added that it was once claimed that the family needed £800,000 a year to live on.

The court was also told how he transferred a number of properties to his ex-wife under the divorce agreement, who the judge also described as 'not on the breadline'.

But she added that because of Mr Prest's disobedience in not paying costs orders in the past it was right that he should provide security of £20,000 to cover his ex-wife's costs before the appeal could proceed.

At a hearing in July, Mrs Prest's counsel Jeremy Posnansky QC said Mr Prest's 'false claims of impoverishment' and 'tale of woe', were untrue.

It was heard that when in London he stayed at the £624 a night Halkin hotel and took his children on luxury skiing holidays.

The court was also told how he spent an estimated £12,000 on buying £175 a time tickets for his children and their friends to a Justin Bieber concert.

He also paid the expensive school fees for the children and took them on holiday, and bought them expensive treats.

But the court heard that when it came to his ex wife, he 'will not pay anything that puts money into her pocket.'

The couple, who have dual British and Nigerian citizenship, have four children after marrying in 1993.

Their divorce became final in November 2011.

Mrs Prest still lives in the £5 million family home in Maida Vale, West London, which she keeps under the divorce settlement.
