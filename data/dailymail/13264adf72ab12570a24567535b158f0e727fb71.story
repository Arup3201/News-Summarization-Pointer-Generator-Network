House Speaker John Boehner has been afforded no rest after the passage of the fiscal cliff bill.

He has been forced to put down a revolt by conservatives furious about the $620billion in tax hikes he pushed through the House. He has also been subjected to withering criticism from Republicans in New York and New Jersey - including Governor Chris Christie - for failing to bring a bill with $60billion in Hurricane Sandy to a vote.

President Barack Obama, meanwhile, has been vacationing on the sunny beaches of Hawaii - leaving Washington just hours after the deal made it through Congress on Tuesday night. 

The White House released a series of 
year-end photos of the President on Wednesday. The first picture in the 
series was of shot of a jubilant Obama frolicking in the warm Hawaiian waters.

Shaky ground: House Speaker John Boehner faces an uncertain political future following wranglings over the fiscal cliff and further criticism for not pushing a vote on a Sandy relief bill

It's a sneaky move that could be interpreted as twisting the dagger in the embattled Boehner, who is in the midst of fighting for political life in chilly Washington.

Boehner appears likely to be re-elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives when the 113th United States Congress is sworn in at midday on Thursday.

While some conservatives had said that 20 or more House Republicans were prepared to mount a challenge to Boehner, no one has been willing to step forward as a rallying figure - an indication that the position is in some ways one of the most difficult and thankless in politics.

Boehner's job as Speaker had been under threat after just 85 members of his Republican caucus voted for a fiscal cliff deal that 151 opposed and nearly all Democrats backed.

Most ominously, his own leadership team publicly split from him over the vote with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy opposing the bill.

Embattled: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said today the John Boehner had refused to take his calls last night over the $60bn Sandy relief bill which is desperately needed in his home state

To add to his woes, Boehner - who faces re-election as Speaker on Thursday - had been lambasted by New Jersey's Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, for failing to bring to a vote a $60billion relief bill for those affected by Hurricane Sandy.

Governor Christie denounced the 'disappointing and disgusting' spectacle of fiscal cliff manoeuvrings that showed a 'callous indifference' for the people of New Jersey. 

Christie said on Wednesday: 'I called the Speaker four times last night after 11.20pm and he did not take my calls.'

But Boehner was able to placate his House Republicans, most notably the outspoken Representative Peter King of New York, by promising to bring the hurricane relief bill to a vote at the beginning of the new Congress.

At one point during the fiscal cliff negotiations, Boehner had been overheard on the House floor saying: 'Am I having a nightmare, or what?'

Boehner took the highly unusual step of voting personally for the Senate bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the other house - just as Speaker Schuyler Colfax was portrayed as doing in the movie Lincoln in voting for the 13th Amendment and the end of slavery.

Tough talk: Paul Ryan voted for the fiscal cliff deal because it was in the interest of the American people

In another indication of a bitterly divided party, the bill pitted another two top Republican prospects for the 2016 White House race against each other. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida voted no and Representative Paul Ryan, the 2012 vice-presidential nominee, voted yes.

According to Republican sources, Cantor and McCarthy voted against the bill even though they had earlier pressured rank-and-file members to support it, while Ryan - another so-called Republican 'Young Gun' in the House - was expected to join them but changed his mind at the last minute.

Ryan later said in a statement: 'Will the American people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative?

'In the final analysis, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I came to Congress to make tough decisions - not to run away from them.'

The influential conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News on Tuesday that it was 'possible' that Cantor's opposition to the bill  'is the prelude to a challenge Thursday', when the new Congress elected last November convenes.

Krauthammer said: 'It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. 

'This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than one to one or one to two or one to three. So, I mean it's a complete rout by the Democrats.'

Via Twitter, Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate, stated that Republicans had been engaged in 'a two month dance of defeat and surrender'.

Donald Trump chipped in, also via Twitter: 'I am a Republican... but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history!'

Multiple accounts of the fiscal cliff negotiations revealed that Boehner appeared to lose his composure on a number of occasions, most notably when he told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the top Democrat on Capitol Hill, to 'go f*** yourself' during a White House meeting.

Christie's broadside against Boehner was also notable because he singled out Cantor as having done his best to bring the Hurricane Sandy bill to a vote.

But Cantor's apparent attempts to get the fiscal cliff bill passed make him an unlikely rallying figure against Boehner, at least in the short term. 

Erick Erickson, a leading conservative figure, used his RedState blog to dismiss the votes of Cantor and McCarthy, saying: 'His was opportunism, not courage.'
