Martin Olsson has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association after appearing to push referee Simon Hooper when he was sent off during Norwich's 1-0 defeat at Wolves on Sunday.

The Swedish defender was given his marching orders on the hour mark after picking up a second booking for a foul on Wolves winger Rajiv van La Parra.

It was as the 26-year-old started to make his way off the pitch at Molineux that he allegedly made physical contact with the official. He faces the possibility of an extended ban if found guilty.

A statement at www.thefa.com said: 'It is alleged that Olsson's action in making physical contact with the referee immediately prior to being shown a red card and for his behaviour as he left the field of play amounted to improper conduct, which occurred outside the jurisdiction of the match officials. 

Olsson now has until 6pm on 14 August 2014 to respond to the charge.
