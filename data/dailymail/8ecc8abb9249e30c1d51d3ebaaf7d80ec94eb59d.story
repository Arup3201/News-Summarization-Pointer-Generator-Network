Spanish underground train passenger Armand Serrano Maya who discovered his vending machine chocolate bar had been nibbled in the corner did not have far to look for the culprit – a mouse that had infiltrated the equipment.

He could see the critter inside the machine where it was continuing to tuck into the free feast.

Armand said: 'I think the sound of me ordering a snack as it dropped into the bin scared the mouse off temporarily, but when I realised my chocolate bar had been nibbled and looked at the other items.

‘I saw that some of them had also been eaten and wanted to take my phone to video them. But then I realised that the mouse was still there, and seconds later it moved back to the front of the vending machine and continue tucking into a pack of chocolate biscuits.'

He said the incident on the Sants-Estacio station of the blue line on the Barcelona metro network had left him feeling ill, saying: 'It was really disgusting, and I posted the video online to complain about it and warn other people. They claim that this food is fresh.'

The Transport Metropolitans of Barcelona which owns and operates the underground line in the eastern Spanish city confirmed that they have started an investigation after being made aware of the video.

They said they had contacted the company that owned the vending machine to demand an explanation.

A spokesman said: 'We understand fully the concerns of our passengers, many of whom have contacted us about this unusual event, and it is being fully investigated and steps will be taken as a result of what we find out.'

A spokesman for the company that owned and operated the vending machine, Selecta, said: 'How the mouse got inside is a complete mystery but we can confirm that the machine has been taken out of service and in the meantime has been completely cleaned, disinfected and sanitised and will be checked by mechanics to make sure this can't happen again before its put back into service.

'The mystery, however, is how it happened in the first place, because we have been offering vending machine services for 16 years in Spain and despite the fact that we have 4000 machines in operation across the country, we have never had a similar case. All machines are not only vandalism proof, they are also secure to prevent pests from getting inside.'
