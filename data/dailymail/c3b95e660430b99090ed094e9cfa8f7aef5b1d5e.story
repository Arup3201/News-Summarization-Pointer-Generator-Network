A gold-rush has hit a seaside town - after a German artist buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of an arts festival.

Hundreds of amateur treasure hunters flocked to a beach at Folkestone, Kent earlier today in a bid to get their hands on a share of the solid gold deliberately buried in the sand.

Excited children with their parents, hobby archeologists and competitive teens packed the beach at low tide to try and find the hidden bullion.

Some treasure hunters believe that using a bigger shovel is the most effective way of finding the gold 

While others have been digging in a more delicate and controlled manner akin to archaeology 

More than 250 treasure hunters tried their luck earlier today digging on their own mini claims on the beach 

Sculptor Michael Sailstorfer has concealed 30 24-carat gold bars on the beach at the outer harbour of the English Channel town as an art project.

The search started at 4pm on Thursday with 150 people arriving to begin digging.

But by Friday lunchtime there were around 250 hunters armed with buckets, spades and even metal detectors.

More are expected over the weekend.

Friends John Daniels, 25, and Ben Helps, 26, travelled from Bournemouth in Dorset to try and get their hands on some buried treasure.

Some of the treasure hunters came armed with metal detectors with reports that the local Argos had even sold out of the high-tech devices 

They stood in one of the deepest holes on the beach as the dug down looking for the precious metal.

But as the tide closed in they said they have had no luck yet.

John said: 'Yesterday we didn't dig, we just stood up the top and watched - getting tactics to see where other people have and haven't dug.

'It's strange because although there's quite a few people down here, everyone's doing it randomly. There's no sense of unity at the moment.'

Ben - standing in his boxers as parts of the two-foot trench begin to close in around him - said: 'I quite like the them and us attitude going on at the moment. It's really competitive.'

But some people have other ideas and have joined up with neighbouring diggers to form a united front.

Folkestone mum Jacky Dannahy, 42, and her son Joseph have teamed up with the Bridges' family and promised to share the wealth.

Dressed in a camouflage jacket, with an army hat and a patch on his eye, Joseph, six, said: 'I've made friends with these boys and now we're all like pirates. So we help each other.'

The beach, which becomes partly covered at high tide, is open to the public, leaving a free-for-all approach to the adventure.

University student Ross Haigger, 21, and his nephews, Oscar and Daniel Daley, said they were finding the experience a lot of fun.

Daniel, five, said: 'We haven't found anything yet but we hope we will. If I do find gold I am going to buy one million thousand ice creams.'

But Oscar, three, said: 'If I found treasure I'd hide it from Daniel.'

One child thought he hit the jackpot when he uncovered this gold-coloured bar - unfortunately it's fake 

Others seem to believe that digging in the sand was its own reward and gold bars would be a bonus 

Despite rumours of the event being a hoax, today no one doubted that thousands of pounds of gold lay hidden beneath their feet.

Father-of-two Mark Anderson, from Canterbury, said: 'I've watched people keep themselves to themselves, taking the whole thing very professionally, and then disappear in the middle of their dig.

'People are obviously finding them - rumour has it maybe three or four - and are just quietly wandering home with a smile on their face.'

The stunt is part of the Berlin sculptor's piece for this year's Triennial - an art festival which starts tomorrow. 

Defying convention, this gentleman has decided to deploy his walking stick to probe the sand 

The bars of gold weigh 10 grams and 20 grams and are worth £250 and £500  each.

It is believed one bar was found on Thursday evening but the unknown treasure hunter has kept their find close to their chest.

The gold fever meant that a branch of Argos in Folkestone completely ran out of metal detectors as savvy hunters used technology in a bid to find the loot.

But it is understood metal washers have also been buried in the sand to make it harder for metal detectors to get an accurate reading - to give people with just spades a better chance of success. 

Some of the treasure hunters have returned to the beach for the second time today to hunt for gold 

The piece, called Folkestone Digs, has been commissioned by the Bristol-based arts producers Situations, an organisation that say they are trying to change the perception of what public art can be.

Director, Claire Doherty, said: 'I am so pleased with how well this has gone.

'It has been the biggest secret to keep as we've been working on it for a year.

'In fact, when we were hiding the gold at four in the morning a dog walker came up to us and said 'What're you up to then? Digging for treasure?'.

'I looked at her for a moment and then she laughed and said 'No, really, what are you doing?' We had to make up a story that we were testing the sand.

'So often public art funding is spent on a sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say, actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time.

'Art helps you explore places and I think what the artist wanted was exactly what you see here today - people away from their iPads and computer screens, alive with imagination and excitement.' 

Festival director Claire Doherty said she is very pleased with the success of the event so far 

Event staff have been working on the gold plan for more than a year and managed to keep the treasure secret
