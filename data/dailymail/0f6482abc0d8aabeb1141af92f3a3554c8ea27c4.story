Fists flew today in the Ukraine parliament after clashes during debates on the country's budget.

Violence broke out as the parliament approved a 2014 state budget which has already been delayed by almost two months.

Vladimir Malyshev, a deputy of the pro-Russian majority, was left with a bleeding forehead and his hands covered in his blood after a tussle.

Medics were sent in to clean up him and procedures resumed.

Despite the opposition's efforts to disrupt the vote, the budget draft was passed in its second reading.

The Ukrainian government approved a programme of cooperation with former Soviet states that have joined the Customs Union, although rapprochement with the Russia-led bloc has fuelled continuing pro-Europe protests in Kiev.

The latest bust up followed chaotic scenes earlier this week which saw seeds, among other things, thrown in the chamber.

Politicians have frequently scuffled in the Ukrainian parliament.

Similar scenes erupted last year 
after members of the pro-Western opposition, who want to take Ukraine 
out of Russia's shadow, traded blows with lawmakers from President 
Viktor Yanukovych's party, which bases its support in the 
Russian-speaking east.

A 
fierce fight in December 2010, which sent at least six lawmakers to the 
hospital, started when members of Yanukovych's party threw chairs and 
punched opponents who had been blocking legislative work all day.

During
 a fight in April 2010, the parliament speaker hid behind an umbrella as
 opposition lawmakers threw eggs and smoke bombs to protest a naval pact
 with Russia.

Ukraine 
is deeply divided into the Russian-speaking east and south, which favors
 close ties with Moscow, and the Ukrainian-speaking west, which wants 
Ukraine to strengthen links with the West.
