A man has been arrested on suspicion of subjecting the mother of murdered toddler James Bulger to vile abuse on Twitter and claiming to be the child's 'ghost'.

Sussex Police confirmed today a 62-year-old man was taken in for questioning before being released on bail pending further investigations.

It followed a series of posts on a Twitter profile named 'James Bulger’s Ghost' that contained images of the two-year-old's gravestone and mocked his murder in Walton, Merseyside in 1993.

Sick: The Twitter profile, named 'James Bulger's Ghost', contained images of the child's gravestone and mocked his murder in Walton, Merseyside in 1993 - describing James as 'dancing on train tracks'

One post 
pretending to be James Bulger read: 'While it cannot be argued that my 
physical existence is somewhat dead, my spirit is pretty much alive.'

Another said James was 'dancing on train tracks'.

After learning of the tweets, James' mother Denise Fergus wrote on Twitter: 'Look at what c**p I am getting off some idiot.'

It led to an outcry on Twitter with users calling the tweets 'disrespectful', 'disgusting' and 'disgraceful' and for the account to be taken down.

The anonymous account holder also
published a reference to Peter Connelly, the toddler better known as 
Baby P, who died as a result of child abuse in 2007.

Another tweet contained a link to a children's musical cartoon, with the poster making references to railway tracks.

Ms 
Fergus urged her 23,000 followers to report the trolls to Twitter 
officials.

The suspect was arrested in Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex last Thursday and was questioned under the Malicious Communications Act 1993.

A force spokesman said: 'Sussex 
detectives arrested a 62-year-old man at an address in Bexhill on 
Thursday May 22, on suspicion of sending offensive Twitter messages 
about James Bulger, contrary to the Malicious Communications Act 1993.

'He was interviewed and bailed until August 28 while enquiries continue.

'Our
 officers are co-ordinating their enquiries with Merseyside Police as 
the Twitter messages were initially reported to that force, but the 
investigation in Bexhill is being carried out by Sussex Police.'

The
 James Bulger Memorial Trust charity was set-up by Denise Fergus in 
2011, and provides holidays to bereaved children and victims of crime.

A spokesman for the Trust said: 'This amounts to criminal abuse and harassment and it should be stopped.'

'Denise has held meetings with representatives of Twitter and she is in direct contact with the police over the matter.

'We are satisfied that everything possible is being done to bring this vile abuse and harrassment to an end.'

James Bulger's mother Denise Fergus urged her 23,000 followers to report the trolls to Twitter

The 'James Bulger's Ghost' account is not the first time Twitter trolls have contacted Ms Fergus.

In
 March this year a poster posing as Jon Venables - one of the toddler's 
killers - sent a series of vile tweets making light of his death.

Using the name @SirJVenables the troll also wrote vile messages about harbouring a desire to kill more children.

The account was shut down by Twitter after users contacted police to complain.

In 
November last year a Twitter user who posted pictures purporting to be 
of James Bulger's killer Jon Venables as an adult was given a 14-month 
suspended prison sentence.

Security guard James Baines was handed the sentence, suspended for 15 months, at London's High Court for contempt of court.

A
 2001 injunction binding on the whole world prohibits the publication of
 any information alleging to identify the appearance, whereabouts, 
movements or new identities of Venables or Robert Thompson.

Twitter
 users who post offensive tweets can be prosecuted under various laws 
including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the Malicious 
Communications Act 1993.

They could also be open actions for civil damages for defamation or distress.

James
 Bulger was just two-years-old when he was abducted from The Strand 
shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in February 1993, by Jon Venables
 and Robert Thompson. 

His body was discovered on railway lines two days later.
