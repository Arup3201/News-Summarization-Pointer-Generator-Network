Authorities say the body of a woman found last week near a Northern California park was that of missing federal defense investigator, Sandra Coke, of Oakland.

Police would not say how she died or offer any more information on a possible link between her death and 56-year-old Randy Alana, a violent sex offender and Coke's former boyfriend.

A major hunt began at the Solano County fairgrounds in Vallejo late 
on Thursday and continued until a body was discovered by Contra Costa County sheriff's search and 
rescue teams in a woody area near Laguna Valley Park, Vacaville, on Friday.

Tragedy: Sandra Coke, 50, whose body has been discovered after she never returned from answering a call about her missing dog

Authorities 
remained tight-lipped about what led dozens of local, state and federal 
investigators to the area and only confirmed yesterday that the body was that of the missing investigator.

Colleagues and friends have expressed their devastation at the news of the death of Coke, 50, who spent decades advocating justice for inmates of death row.

'It's been real heartbreaking,' said 
Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama, 
where Coke worked in the mid-1990s. 'She was just a wonderful person and
skilled and committed advocate. It's a terrible, terrible loss.'

Starting in the 1990s, Coke worked for the California 
Appellate Project, the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, the Equal
Justice Initiative of Alabama and her own private investigation office.

At the time of her death, she had been working for the Office of the Federal Defender in the
Eastern District of California in Sacramento, where she helped overturn
a wrongfully obtained murder conviction in Sacramento County in 2001, 
according to federal defender Heather Williams.

Thorough: Multiple agencies searched for evidence in the case of Sandra Coke

Coke left her Oakland home shortly 
after 8.30 pm on August 4 after reportedly telling her 15-year-old daughter
she was meeting with someone who had found her missing dog.

She said she would be back in 30 minutes. Her daughter called police when her mother did not come home that night.

Later that night, she was seen with Alana, a
high-risk sex offender with a lengthy criminal history whom she dated 
some 20 years ago, police said.

Sources said that video has been recovered showing Coke's car crossing the Carquinez Bridge after her disappearance.

Her car was subsequently found in a West Oakland 
parking lot, and one of her cellphones was found in Richmond last week.

Alana, 56, of Oakland, a registered sex offender with convictions for voluntary manslaughter, rape and kidnapping, was arrested on an unspecified parole violation on August 6.

He 
has not yet been named a suspect or charged in Coke's death.

Oakland police Officer Johnna Watson said: 'We are looking at an angle to see if foul play was involved.'

A family friend, Laura Burstein, said
Coke dated Alana more than 20 years ago.

Another friend, Dan 
Abrahamson, told KGO-TV, that Alana recently reappeared in the area and 
reached out to Coke for help.

Alana
was being held without bail. He is considered a high-risk sex offender,
with state records showing he has convictions for rape and kidnapping.

Dozens of Coke's family and friends announced a $100,000 reward on Thursday for any information leading to her return.

‘These last few days have been a living nightmare,’ said her sister, Tanya Coke, who believes foul play may be involved.

Questioned: Former boyfriend Randy Alana was arrested in connection with Coke's disappearance, but police refuse to confirm any links between the former convicted sex offender and her death

Calls
to Tanya Coke on Friday were not immediately returned. Earlier, Sandra 
Coke's family released a statement hoping for her return.

‘We
are enormously grateful for the efforts of everyone - law enforcement, 
colleagues and friends of Sandra, and members of the public and the 
media - who have labored day and night - to find Sandra,’ the statement 
read.

Police found 
Coke's 2007 Mini Cooper convertible on Monday, just a few blocks from 
her home and her cellphones were discovered near the Oakland-Emeryville 
border and near Interstate 80 in Richmond.

On Tuesday afternoon, Coke's family released a statement thanking law 
enforcement, the public and others for helping in the search.

'The Coke family is devastated by the loss of our beloved Sandra,' the 
statement read.

'She was a loving mother, daughter, sister and auntie, 
and a shining light in our family; her good cheer, easy laugh and 
generous hugs will be missed.

'Those of us who were privileged to know Sandra will remember her as an 
unusually kind, generous and big-hearted person.

'She passionately 
devoted her professional life to helping the poor and those who endured 
difficult childhoods.

'All of us will miss Sandra's beautiful, giving 
spirit.'

Coke came to Alabama in 1995, a time when juveniles could be put to 
death for crimes, and when the juvenile death row population, at 16 
inmates, was the largest in the nation, her colleague Bryan Stevenson said.

As
an investigator, she was assigned to probe capital cases that are 
appealed to federal court to ensure death sentences are fair.

Her work 
collecting school records and interviewing family and friends uncovered 
that most of the juveniles suffered traumatic childhoods, evidence not 
presented during trial.

It was Coke's gentle way of interviewing inmates and their families that Stevenson remembers most.

'She had a wonderful way of endearing people to her and persuading 
people to talk to her about difficult things,' he said.

The family asked for privacy to mourn and thanked friends for 
creating a fund to provide for her daughter's care and education.

Donations to that fund can be made at www.sandracokefund.org.
