A female doctor is accused of putting a toxic chemical in the coffee of her lover, a co-worker at a Texas hospital.

Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, a breast cancer oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was charged last week with aggravated assault against Dr. George Blumenschein, a specialist in lung and head and neck cancers at the institution.

The pair were engaged in a 'casual sexual relationship,' according to the complaint filed May 29, when the incident occurred.

On Jan. 27, Gonzalez-Angulo reportedly served Blumenschein coffee that tasted sweet, something he questioned her about because he preferred his coffee black.

The 42-year-old woman said she had added Splenda and urged him to drink it, which he did even having a second cup.

Rather than sweetener, Gonzalez-Angulo is accused of mixing ethylene glycol into the coffee. It is a sweet-tasting toxic substance used in antifreeze and medical research.

Four hours later, Blumenschein's started slurring his speech and experiencing poor balance as well as the loss of fine motor skills.

Gonzalez-Angulo is alleged to have given her colleague poisoned coffee, which she claimed was Splenda, at their workplace the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center

Medical records show he was taken to an 
emergency center 16 hours after drinking the coffee. He was found to 
have cardiopulmonary complications, central nervous system depression 
and renal failure and had to undergo dialysis.

Gonzalez-Angulo has denied the charge and her lawyer Derek Hollingsworth has said she is 'completely innocent.'

'She is a distinguished citizen and scientist, and these allegations are totally inconsistent with her personal and professional life,' said Hollingsworth in a statement to the Houston Chronicle.

The statement added that the UT Police Department 'jumped the gun in this case and filed charges that should never have been filed.'

Gonzalez-Angulo was booked May 30 and released on $50,000 bail.

She is currently on paid administrative leave, while Blumenschein is still recovering.
