One can't help but stare at Phil the homeless kitten born in Boston without upper eyelids.

The brave little feline would have gone blind had he not had life-changing surgery on December 9 to help him see again.

The three-month-old kitten received successful surgery at the hand of Dr.Martin Coster from Angel Animal Medical Center, announced the MSPCA on Wednesday. 

Survivor: A homeless kitten named Phil received sight-saving surgery at Angell Animal Medical Center last week after he was born with no eyelids three months ago 

Brave: Phil is expected to recover fully from the surgery and will be put up for adoption with his best friend, another adorable cat named Vixen

Phil was born with a condition called Agenesis which makes it impossible for him to blink and therefore would have caused his eyes to dry up and eventually stop functioning.

MSPCA’s Boston adoption center manager Alyssa Krieger first came across Phil and Vixen at the Boston Animal Control shelter in Roslindale on November 24.

'I was immediately struck by Phil’s personality, in addition to the unusual situation surrounding his eyes,' she said.

'Even though his lack of eyelids caused painful irritation, he was still a typical and playful kitten. We were eager to get him back to Angel where we knew he could get the operating he needed to save his sight,' she added.

Dr. Coster agreed to perform the operation with a novel form of surgery by taking some of tissue from the cat's lip and using it to form an eyelid.

'A cat’s upper eyelid is very similar in form and function to the tissue in their lip,' he said.

'By taking some tissue from Phil’s lip and attaching it to the muscles that enable him to blink, we can, in effect, reconstruct his missing eyelids.'

Just one week after the surgery Phil is able to blink again and can lubricate his own eyes.

'I expect Phil to recover completely and there’s no reason to believe he won’t have a long and healthy life—with the pain and discomfort of his condition finally resolved,' said Coster.

In around two weeks Phil is expected to recover and be put up for adoption with another cat named Vixen who is Phil's best friend.
