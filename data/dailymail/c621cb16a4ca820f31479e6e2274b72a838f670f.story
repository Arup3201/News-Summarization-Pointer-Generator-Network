Being on first name terms with work colleagues may seem friendly, but NHS staff have decided it can be a little too familiar.

A new drive for ‘professional courtesy’ at one NHS Trust means staff will address each other more formally in future.

Pressure from senior staff at Kent Community Health NHS Trust has led to a policy telling staff not to use first names without a title - unless permission has been expressly given.

No longer will a doctor or nurse use first names only when speaking to each other.

Instead, they will say 'Sister Megan' or 'Nurse Lisa' - a tradition that has been dying out.

‘There has been unease among senior staff at being addressed by their first name, particularly by junior staff ‘ said Trust source.

‘It was noticed that cleaners and clerks were talking to senior personnel as if they had known them for years’ they added.

The Trust has now introduced a professional courtesy conduct rule whereby staff no longer just use first names.

It comes after consistent complaints by patients that they object to their first names being used by NHS staff who are strangers.

A number of Trusts have responded with new rules, saying staff will ask patients how they wish to be addressed, for example as Mrs or Ms.

Staff are also advised to avoid lapsing into over-familiarity unless this is acceptable to, and agreed by the patient.

Using colloquial terms such as ‘dear’ and ‘petal’ are banned by Dorset County Hospital, for example, unless the patient’s agreement has been sought.

Patients at Kent Community Health Trust now want to get in on the act, according to a letter published in its internal journal.

‘May I ask that you consider also asking your staff to refrain from using first names for patients unless the patient specifically asks them to’ writes a former patient from Maidstone.

‘I am aware that many patients do prefer the use of a first name and this should obviously be an option.

‘However, some people prefer not to be infantilised by the use of their first names and the use of ‘ dear’ and ‘ darling’, particularly with more elderly patients.

‘Patients should be given as much respect as nurses and doctors have’ says the letter.

The Trust source said the idea was ‘under consideration’.
