These photos show how British pilots are putting a £100million fighter jet through its paces ahead of its first appearance in British skies this summer.

The first of the UK's F-35s – dubbed the Lightning II by maker Lockheed Martin – are at a 
giant military airfield in Florida’s Panhandle region, where pilots are practicing flying them backwards, stopping them in mid-air and reaching top speeds of 1.6 times the speed of sound.

The Daily Mail was invited for an 
exclusive, behind-the-scenes visit at the Eglin Air Force Base to find out how the first three 
British flyers and their 13 engineers are learning how to operate the 
F-35, which is recognisable by its sharp-angled design and special 
coating which makes it hard for enemy radars to detect.

Futuristic: The model is designed to take-off and land vertically like its predecessor, the Harrier jump jet - but can also fly backwards for the first time

The Ministry of Defence and 
manufacturers are negotiating its first British appearance, where it is 
set to fly as part of the Farnborough air show in Hampshire and the 
Royal International Air Tattoo in Gloucestershire.

Although a US Air Force base, Eglin in Florida also hosts a detachment of British servicemen who are learning to fly and maintain the ‘B’ version of the F-35, 138 of which are destined for the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.

This model is designed to take off and land vertically, like the Harrier jump jet, but can also fly backwards and land on the deck of aircraft carriers, including the two new Queen Elizabeth class ships being built for Britain’s Royal Navy.

It can fly at Mach 1.6 – faster than the speed of sound – and has a range of more than 1,000 miles.

Three of the F-35Bs at Eglin are already on the UK’s military aircraft register and have to be flown according to British rules and regulations.

British flyers and maintainers from both the RAF and Royal Navy are already embedded with the US Marines’ VMFAT-501 Squadron at Eglin.

Facts and figures: The new aircraft has been criticised for its £100m per jet cost, but it is also set to be the most advanced ever flown by the Royal Air Force

Revving up: The jet in test flights over the U.S. in 2011. It is set to come into service in Britain from 2018 and will be first be used by 617 Squadron - the Dambusters

In scenes reminiscent of the 1980s movie Top Gun, Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Ian Tidball, 44, is one of the British aces putting an F-35 through its paces.

The former Sea Harrier pilot from Somerset, who has also flown the Boeing F/A-18 fighter bomber on exchange posting, describes the F-35 as a ‘step change’ from the other aircraft he has piloted.

It can stop in mid-air and fly backwards at up to 30 knots

Airspeed, heading, altitude and targets are all projected on to the visor of the pilot's helmet instead of a display in the cockpit

‘Each has been incrementally challenging and capable. But the F-35 flight control system is very good,’ he said.

‘It really does make flying the aeroplane very easy. While the Sea Harrier was very good, it was a stick and rudder aircraft and a lot of time was spent just flying the aeroplane.’

When hovering, the F-35B’s engine swivels round to direct thrust downwards and a hinged flap on top of the aircraft lifts up, similar doors opening on the underside, to direct the blast from its unique Rolls-Royce lift fan.

The F-35 effectively sits on two columns of air as it is suspended like the Cold War-era Harrier.

Unlike the Harrier, which needed the pilot to juggle three cockpit controls to keep it steady in the hover, the F-35’s computerised flight controls allow the jet to be manipulated using just the throttle and joystick.

Tidball says: ‘With the F-35 there’s more time to operate the mission systems and there is a vast array of capability. The stealth capability is the other huge asset.’

Inside the cockpit is dominated by a giant flat screen that is touch-sensitive, making it intuitive to use for the iPad generation of pilots who will eventually go on to fly the aircraft in combat zones around the world. Many of the functions can also be activated by the pilot’s voice.

The F-35’s stealth or ‘low observable’ nature comes both from its sharp angled design and the special coatings on its body that help it to almost disappear from enemy radar screens.

Another hi-tech feature is the inclusion of six miniature cameras which look outside the aircraft and can check for threats like enemy missiles.

Feat of engineering: The jet is introduced by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in 2012. The RAF says it will be by the far the most advanced it has ever flown

Sunrise on a new era: The jets can take off and land vertically and even fly backwards - but our reporter found a simulator remarkably easy to use

Night flying: The jet is equipped with advanced cameras which allows it to fly at supersonic speeds and carry out complex missions in total darkness

Precision: The jet is so well-engineered that it takes away some of the pure joy of flying - or in layman's terms, flying by the seat of one's pants

The information these cameras gather can be projected inside the visor of the pilot’s helmet or beamed to other jets in the formation, or commanders on the ground. The helmet also allows the pilot to see ‘through’ the aircraft’s structure to the ground below.

The one downside of all this technology is that pilots joke it removes some of the fun of pure handling skills – in aviation parlance, flying by the seat of your pants.

Thanks to some top flight instruction from Lockheed Martin’s test pilots I was able to sample the F-35 simulator for myself at the US defence giant’s Fort Worth factory.

Anyone used to operating an iPad or similar tablet would instantly feel at home in the cockpit. The massive touch screen display controls everything from radar and cameras to engine instruments.

Falling to hand are a massive joystick and throttle, each covered in dozens of buttons to handle every aspect of flight, ensuring the pilot barely need move his hands from the controls.

Inside the helmet information on altitude, heading and speed is projected, along with symbols to show enemy aircraft and missiles.

It really was easy to fly the F-35 thanks to a single button control which puts it into the classic Harrier-style hover.

And flying aerobatics in the stealth fighter felt just like playing a computer game – without the G forces that pilots in the real jet experience, of course.

Group Captain Willy Hackett, a veteran
 combat pilot who is the UK’s national deputy in the F-35 Joint Program 
Office, says: ‘I would have a large smile on my face to see the F-35 on 
the ramp as I walked out to the aircraft. It has to instil confidence in
 the pilot.’

He adds: ‘Our 
F-35 pilots will be some of our best educated people on the battlefield.
 The future F-35 pilots will be very much more systems operators and 
tacticians now, controlling the inflow of information. The actual flying
 is second nature.’

On 
arriving at Eglin, the British personnel complete in-depth academic 
courses and train in simulators before going on to an introductory 
10-hour course to get them used to the F-35. As there is no two-seater 
jet, unlike previous generations of aircraft, the first time they take 
off in the aircraft will be the first time they fly it for real.

They then practice take-offs and landings and flying in formation with other aircraft before moving on to air-to-air fighting and attacking ground targets.

There is an equally steep learning curve for the engineers and technicians on F-35.

Sergeant Ken Dorfard, one of the maintainers hand-picked to be the first to go through F-35 training, explains the stealth aircraft has some unique challenges for his people, who must maintain its complex systems.

Dorfard, who joined the RAF in 1991, says: ‘We have special shoes to walk on the aircraft so we don’t damage the surface. The stuff behind the panels is easier to work on thanks to computerisation, but it is harder to access. It’s not that different to a fourth generation jet like the Tornado or Harrier. In some ways the electronic testing takes the fun out of it.’

One of the biggest differences between F-35 and previous fighters is the sheer scale of the computer programming involved. Some eight million lines of computer coding is involved and much of the aircraft’s capabilities depend on this technology being completed on time and working.

‘It is a challenging aspect of the programme,’ says Lockheed Martin’s Mike Rein.

The aircraft’s software will be continually updated during its 50-plus year lifespan.

Once the development work is completed Britain could buy fewer than the 138 aircraft it originally signed up for. With a price tag of up to £100m per jet, the F-35 has attracted some controversy at a time of widespread cuts in defence spending.

But the RAF and Royal Navy are adamant it will be a game-changing aeroplane that will increase British forces’ capabilities on the future battlefield.

The RAF’s famous 617 Squadron – the Dambusters – will be the first British unit to get the F-35 and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk from 2018. The squadron was temporarily stood down at the end of March when its Tornado bombers were retired.
