The Duchess of Cambridge may already be pregnant with her second child and plans to add another baby to the royal brood but one controversial feminist has slammed her decision, saying she's 'too thin' and should stop.

Germaine Greer, who penned best-selling book The Female Eunuch in 1970, said that the former Kate Middleton, who gave birth to Prince George last July, is 'too thin' and shouldn't have any more children.

Speaking to British-based magazine Newsweek Europe about Kate’s chronic morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum, the 75-year-old Australian said: 'The girl is too thin! [Kate] is vomiting her guts up and shouldn’t have been made to go through all this again so soon. 

'It’s not so much that she has to be a womb, but she has to be a mother. I would hope after this one she says, "That’s it. No more".'

Hyperemesis gravidarum is brutal. Affecting only two per cent of pregnant women, the sickness is so severe that sufferers end up dehydrated and weak.

This often results in hospital admission - as it did when Kate was carrying her first child - for intravenous fluids and heavy-duty anti-sickness drugs.

If that wasn't enough, Greer added that 32-year-old Kate had a 'b*****d of a job' because she had been 'put in charge of William'.

She believes that Kate's interests have been limited by the royal family, which she dismisses as a 'mad anachronism', and argues that Kate has had to learn exactly how to behave, adding that spontaneity will get her in trouble.

She also states that Kate, who graduated from St Andrews University with a 2.1 honours degree in art history in 2005, is a great deal more intelligent than the rest of the royals yet is 'made to appear absolutely anodyne'. 

Germaine, a theorist, academic and journalist,  is widely regarded as one of the mid-twentieth century's most controversial feminist voices.

She has penned numerous tomes, including Sex and Destiny: The Politics of Human Fertility (1984); The Change: Women, Ageing and the Menopause (1991) and The Whole Woman (1999). 

Time to stop? Speaking about Kate, who is mother to one-year-old George and is already pregnant with baby number two, Greer said: '[Kate] is vomiting her guts up and shouldn't have been made to go through all this again so soon. It's not so much that she has to be a womb, but she has to be a mother. I would hope after this one she says, "That's it. No more".'

She once defined her goal as 'women's liberation' as distinct from "equality with men' and aims to promote the freedom of women to define their own values and determine their own fate.

Childless Greer left home in her youth due to conflict with her family.

She tied the knot to  Welsh carpenter Paul du Feu in London in 1968 - but the marriage only lasted three-and-a-half weeks.

Republican Greer actually met the Queen - and famously curtseyed - during a visit to Buckingham Palace in 2006. 

The Queen was hosting a reception for Australians ahead of her royal tour, when she opened the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.  

Last weekend, the Duchess was forced to pull out of a tour of Malta on behalf of the Queen, leaving Prince William to stand in for her.

Kate was also due to join William at an engagement in Oxford three weeks ago but was too ill - and it was her absence that prompted the Palace to announce her pregnancy prematurely.

However, according to Royal aides, the Duchess is planning to resume official engagements next month, with a spokesman telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘There will be engagements in October and November. We just haven’t announced them yet.’

The Duchess has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – the condition she suffered during her pregnancy with Prince George. Although she has not been admitted to hospital this time, she has received medical assistance at Kensington Palace.

The Duchess’s last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William and Prince Harry.

Over the summer she headed to Belgium for First World War centenary commemorations and was in Yorkshire in July for the start of the Tour de France. 

But she has not carried out a charitable engagement since July, when went to a North London school to see one of her M-Pact projects, and has told aides she is keen to revisit some of her charities. 

Now that she is feeling better, the couple are expected to move into their new ten-bedroom Georgian pile, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.

Taking pity? Greer added that 32-year-old Kate had a 'b*****d of a job' because she had been 'put in charge of William' and her interests have been limited by the royal family

‘While they will be predominantly living in Norfolk, the intention is for Kate to hop between London and Norfolk while looking after Prince George,’ said a source. 

Three weeks after it was revealed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a second child, some punters are placing sums of at least £1,000 on its name.

And with speculation rife as to what Prince William and Kate will call their new child, one of the most authoritative of royal authors claimed today that he is convinced they will name it after Diana.

Andrew Morton - who wrote a biography of the Princess of Wales which revealed the truth behind her strained royal relationships - said a daughter would be given the name Elizabeth Diana Windsor. 

Kate’s latest pregnancy was announced on September 8, as it was revealed she was suffering from very acute morning sickness and being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace. 

The couple are choosing to base their family in Norfolk, but the new baby will be delivered at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London, where Prince George was born in July 2013.
