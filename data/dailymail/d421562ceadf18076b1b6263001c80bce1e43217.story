A Texas high school teacher shot himself 
dead on Wednesday, a day after he resigned from his position following 
allegations he had an improper sexual relationship with a student.

Mark Lampman, 47, a government teacher at Permian High School in Odessa was found by deputies in West Odessa on Wednesday afternoon in an open field, the Odessa American reported.

Lampman, who had worked at the school for 17 years and was also the assistant girls golf coach, resigned Tuesday afternoon after an accusation about an improper relationship with a female student was made to school officials.

Even more shocking is that over the last 
year, four other female teachers at the school have come under 
allegations that they have also had sexual relationships with students.

Alisha Carrasco Knighten, a physical education teacher and assistant softball coach at Permian High School, resigned last week amid an investigation of a possible improper relationship with a student

Alisha Carrasco Knighten, an assistant softball coach at Permian, resigned last week amid an investigation into a possible improper relationship with a student.

Such allegations cover any sexual contact or intercourse between a student and teacher.

Carrasco Knighten was placed on paid administrative leave on April 28 and resigned two days later.

Another unidentified female teacher resigned earlier this month over similar allegations according the the local paper.

In April 2013, swimming and diving coach Kathryn Maples, 28, resigned over allegations of an improper relationship with a 17-year-old student.

She was indicted in June on three charges of an improper relationship including sending sexually explicit photographs to a student and online solicitation.

A trainer at Permian, April Collins, 28, also reigned that month over allegations of an improper relationship with a 19-year-old student.

She was indicted in June on four counts of sending sexual images and online solicitation.

If convicted, the pair could face anywhere between two and 20 years in prison and a possible fine of up to $10,000.

No date has yet been set for either trial.

Ector County Independent School District were forced to respond to angry online postings by students and teachers in the wake of the sex scandal.

'Our ECISD family is deeply saddened by the events that unfolded. The remaining days and weeks of the school year will be very difficult at Permian High School. In an immediate response there will be crisis counselors available to all students and faculty members tomorrow and Friday,' their statement said.

'We know and understand emotions are raw, and we have seen a number of very inappropriate and hateful posts to social media sites this evening.

'Out of respect for the families involved in this tragedy, we are urging everyone to remove all angry messages from all accounts and refrain from posting any more. This type of dialogue is not helpful, nor is it healing.'

'We consider ourselves part of the same team – the same family – and we must work together to get through a difficult time like this.'

Ector County Independent School District spokesman Mike Adkins told Odessa American the allegations were 'alarming and disappointing'.

April Collins resigned in April 2013 from Permian High School and was indicted on charges of having an improper relationship between educator and student

Kathryn Maples also resigned in April 2013 and was indicted with a second-degree felony charge due to an inappropriate relationship with a student

'Another allegation of this sort is alarming and disappointing.'

'The school district provides training to address this issue each year, and we plan more in the future,' he said. 

'Our
 teachers are hired to teach, support, and inspire our students to great
 achievement and it is unacceptable to an educator to cross the line 
from professional to personal relationship. We are glad these 
allegations are being reported, and we investigate every report that 
comes to us. We will do everything in our power to address this 
immediately.'

Permian, which enrolls about 2,300 students, was made famous in 1990 with the publication of the book, 'Friday Night Lights,' about the school's football team. A movie and TV were also made based on the book.
