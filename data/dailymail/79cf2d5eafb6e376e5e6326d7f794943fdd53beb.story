Villarreal have confirmed they have agreed a deal in principle with Arsenal for defender Gabriel Paulista to join the Gunners in a £15million deal.

The 24-year-old, who Arsene Wenger recently confirmed was a transfer target for the club, is expected to join the club imminently with Joel Campbell joining the La Liga side on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the agreement.  

The news comes following Paulista was left out of Villarreal's 18-man squad to face Levante at El Madrigal on Saturday night, increasing speculation that the Brazilian was closing in on a move to the Emirates.

The La Liga side confirmed the news on their official Twitter account saying: 'The principle of agreement for the transfer of Gabriel with @Arsenal has been completed. He will say his goodbyes today before the party. good luck!'

They also announced the signing of Campbell adding: 'Welcome @joel_campbell12 to Villarreal as Arsenal agree to loan the player until the end of the season!'

Work permit rules may yet prove to be an issue in the deal though, as Paulista is yet to play international football.

But as Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday, Arsenal will appeal any decision not to give Paulista - who has a £15m buy-out clause - a permit this month in an attempt to land him now.
