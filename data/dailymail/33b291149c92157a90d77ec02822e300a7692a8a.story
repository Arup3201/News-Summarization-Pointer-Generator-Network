Boxing Day set a new British record for the number of shoppers who went online, figures showed today as crowds descended on high streets once again for another day of frenzied sales.

While thousands of shoppers queued outside stores up and down the country to get ahead of the game, millions more made the most of tumbling prices from the comfort of their own homes.

Britons spent 14 million hours trawling websites yesterday, paying around 113 million visits to online retailers on what became the UK's biggest day for internet shopping, analysts said.

The figures emerged as stores threw open 
their doors this morning, offering further discounts and sparking scenes
of mayhem on shop floors.

Web sales were up by 17 per cent on Boxing Day last year, according to market data firm Experian.

Figures were slightly lower than the 126 million online visits predicted for Boxing Day, something experts attributed to a 'sales creep' which saw retailers begin to slash prices before Christmas.

James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said: 'Boxing Day set a new British record for online shopping with 113 million visits going to retail websites in a single day.

'However, with a number of the major retailers bringing their sales forward to Christmas Eve, the impact of that was that Boxing Day was slightly muted and not as prolific as we forecast.'

Figures show that Christmas Eve was 86
per cent bigger than last year as a shopping day, and Christmas Day was
71 per cent bigger.

While Boxing Day fell short of expectations, online shopping is still set to be up on last year by about 30 per cent.

John Lewis today revealed that their online sales are growing at 40 per cent a year.

The department store, which started it’s
online sale on Christmas Eve, said that increasingly their customers 
were visiting stores and shopping online.

A spokesman said: 'Shops are 
absolutely key to our business, and as well as growth in sales from our 
shops, we are actively investing in our physical estate.

'While
our online business is growing at 40 per cent, shops are also seeing 
growth, and as our customers become more omnichannel, our online and 
physical offers are more closely dependent than ever before.'

The company said it was offering discounts of up to £300 TV brands including Sharp and Panasonic.

It was another busy day in London's 
bustling West End where footfall hit record levels yesterday - up 31.3 
per cent on Boxing Day last year.

Similar scenes played out across the 
rest of the country as retailers offered hefty discounts in a bid to 
lure shoppers and compete with online rivals.

Discount-hungry shoppers were in force again today with the West End alone expecting to take tens of millions of pounds.

China and the Middle East hungry for luxury brands such as Alexander 
McQueen and Miu Miu as businesses did yesterday.

Jace Tyrrell, a spokesman for the New West End Company which represents shops in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street, said he expects this year’s sales to beat last year's.

He said: 'I think it is going to be a very big 48 hours for the UK's shops.

'A lot of people are wanting to get out of the house having spent the last few days inside for Christmas will hit the shops.

'We hit our forecast of £50m takings yesterday and we expect tens of millions of pounds to be taken today.'

The West End alone expects to net a massive £1billion in the six weeks from mid November until the end of the December sales.

Most shops have seen profits rise by between two and ten per cent compared with this time last year.

The
busy post Christmas trade is crucial to helping shops recover from the 
slump in sales this summer, which many have blamed on the Olympics.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the dash for discounts was boosted by consumers who were feeling the pinch.

BRC
spokesman Richard Dodd said: 'Customers are under lots of financial 
pressure and are really keen on seeking out value and taking advantage 
of bargains.

'Today will be another big day when some retailers will launch their sales and that will help to continue the momentum.'

Kent's
Bluewater shopping centre, which welcomed 130,000 visitors yesterday - 
some of whom queued from 1am - said it was expecting an even busier day 
today.

The mall, which predicts some 900,000 people will surge through its doors during the next six days, is open until 10pm tonight.

Robert Goodman, Bluewater's general manager, said: 'Boxing Day's momentum has continued into today, with the opening of the John Lewis clearance sale being a major draw.'

The UK's largest independent shoe retailer Cloggs also saw online visits surge over Christmas and Boxing Day - with a 1000 per cent increase in customers using a handheld device to surf the store.

Cloggs said it experienced a record level of users, with more than ever using an smartphone or simliar device to try and bag a bargain on the move.

Chris Thomas, Cloggs' founder and CEO, said: 'Christmas Day itself and Boxing Day broke all records, in terms of visitor numbers and sales as people took advantage of aggressive discounting available across all big brand names.

'Our busiest days of the year were Christmas and Boxing Day, when we experienced a record level of visitors and sales through handheld devices.

'We have seen an increase of 1000 per cent compared to last year. Consumers are checking offers and prices and making purchases on the go, wherever they are and whenever they feel like it. Retailers who respond to these changes in behaviour will be the real winners this Christmas.'
