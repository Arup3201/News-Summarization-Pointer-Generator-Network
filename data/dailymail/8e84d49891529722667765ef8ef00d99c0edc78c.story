Overdue? Margaret Sanchez, 30, was arrested on Wednesday for the murder of a New Orleans stripper found dismembered and washed up on Mississippi beaches across two counties in 2012

An arrest has finally been made in the grisly murder of a New Orleans stripper who was stabbed and dismembered in 2012.

Margaret Sanchez was booked on second degree murder charges in the death of Jaren Lockhart, whose head and body parts were found strewn across Mississippi beaches in two counties.

The 30-year-old, who was picked up at her parents' Metairie home Wednesday, is known to be one of the last two people to see the slain 22-year-old mother but was released after an initial arrest due to lack of evidence.

Sgt. Brian McGregor said Sanchez was arrested by Kenner, Louisiana police, the U.S. Marshal's Gulf Coast Regional Task Force, FBI, and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.

Missing in reports of Sanchez's arrest were two things: mention of a motive in the horrific, headline-grabbing slaying and any hint at whether Sanchez's long-suspected accomplice Terry Speaks will also be charged.

Speaks, 41, is currently in a New York federal prison after having been picked up since the murder on charges the convicted sex offender failed to register as such.

More information about Speaks' potential involvement and possibly his and Sanchez's relationship to the deceased, who was last seen on security footage with the couple the night she disappeared, was expected to come Thursday morning when authorities had scheduled a press conference.

Friends and family of Lockhart's had already expressed their appreciation for all the detective work that led tot he arrest before day's end Wednesday.

'We're 
just over-the-moon happy, today,' Alice Maxwell Swain, a close family 
friend of Lockhart's, told NOLA.com. 'It's closer to justice. It's the 
news we've been waiting for.'

Lockhart's brother Lance concurred in a Facebook post.

'I knew it would happen all in time. God doesn't sleep,' he said.

Lockhart's daughter Rylie is now 5 and living with her grandmother.

Authorities found the stabbed torso of Jaren Lockhart, 22, washed up in Mississippi's Hancock County in June 2012, NOLA reported at the time.

Her decapitated head and parts of her legs were found in nearby Harrison County.

Authorities
 were able to identify Lockhart based on her neck tattoos. Her fiance 
reported her missing after she did not return from a shift at a Bourbon 
Street club.

'The new information, from a circumstantial point, indicates a higher probability that the killing happened in Kenner,' Glenn Grannan, a lead investigator for Hancock County, told WAFB. 'The evidence was strong enough to convince the District Attorney, which is huge.'

Terry 
Speaks and Margaret Sanchez were the last two people to see Lockhart 
alive. They were seen on surveillance video walking with Lockhart down a
 street, NOLA reported in 2012.Â 

Both were briefly held before they were released. Sanchez was released due to a lack of evidence, the Associated Press reports, and Speaks is currently in a New York prison for an unrelated charge.

Grannan told the wire service that Sanchez has since moved from Louisiana and that Speaks was questioned several months ago.
