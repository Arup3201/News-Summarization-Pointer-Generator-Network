Imaginary: Sarah Jane Smith, 41, also claimed her real children were disabled in the benefits scam

A mother has escaped jail despite pretending she had eight children in a £42,000 benefits scam.

Sarah Jane Smith, 41, even pretended that she and her two real children were disabled so that she could claim even more cash.

Yes despite the false claims, stretching back to 2005, Smith, from Manchester, was spared jail after the judge heard she was fighting breast cancer for the second time.

Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court was told that it was the second time Smith had carried out the scam.

She had previously cheated taxpayers out of £27,854 in a four-year scam which began in 2005.

The matter was dealt with in the civil courts, and she was ordered to repay the money.

But Smith returned to the fraud soon afterwards, and began to invent more children after falling into debt.

She submitted 25 bogus claims between October 2009 and August 2010.

As well as claiming for made-up children, Smith also told benefit officials that she, her teenage son and adult daughter all had disabilities.

Simon Blakebrough, prosecuting, said the initial claims for child tax credit had been legitimate - but suspicions were raised as new children were added.

He said: 'A number of similar calls, similar claims, were made by the defendant over that period.

'She made a call claiming for fictitious children.

'She did the same again about a week later, claiming for other children that did not exist. As a result of an investigation, Ms Smith was arrested.

'She was interviewed and gave a no comment reply to all the questions put to her.'

Smith, from Almond Close, Pendleton, 
pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to one count of being knowingly 
concerned in fraudulent activity with a view to obtain payment of tax 
credit. She broke down in tears in the dock.

The court heard that Inland Revenue officers began their criminal investigation in 2009, after becoming suspicious as the amounts she claimed - and her number of children - increased year after year.

Judge Adrian Smith handed her a six-month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered her to complete 120 hours of unpaid work.

Describing her earlier scam, the judge said: 'You were not prosecuted. You were dealt with through civil jurisdiction.

'You do not come before the court as a person of good character but there is another side to you which impresses people.'

The mother, who is currently paying back the £27,000 she claimed in her initial scam, now faces repaying the second amount as well.

Austin
Welch, defending Smith, who volunteers for two charities, said she made
the calls because of debt resulting from 'appalling financial 
mismanagement'.

He said: 'It
is one of the most stupid offences. It would almost always have 
resulted in Ms Smith being caught. She is extremely sorry. It was just 
stupidity that led her to do this.'
