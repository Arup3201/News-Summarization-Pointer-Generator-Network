It is 45 years since John Wayne took home an Oscar for his role as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit.

But today the wily US Marshal made an unlikely comeback: in a news flash about a prison break.

In a shambolic mix up on WDKY Fox 56, a picture of the late actor's iconic role flashed on viewers' screen with the caption 'Michael Fleet' - the name of a convicted thief who escaped from a Kentucky prison last week.

His face, complete with eye patch and cowboy hat, appeared alongside that of serial burglar Joshua Stephenson, the other inmate who ran from his cell and hid in his ex-girlfriend's apartment for five days.

Apologizing for the confusion, station managers explained the photo Cogburn is the default image for mugshots before they are uploaded.

Due to an error before the 10pm screening, Michael Fleet's mugshot was not programmed into the segment, leaving viewers with Wayne's growling expression.

Fleet, who escaped Blackburn Correctional Center, is still on the run.

A '60s classic: Wayne, who died in 1979, was lauded for his role alongside Katharine Hepburn in the movie

Stephenson, 23, was detained on Thursday after police received a tip-off.

The mother of his child told police Stephenson, who is in the middle of a five-year term, called her last week saying he had been released from prison and was coming to see her, Fox 19 reported.

By 12.30am on Thursday, he was booked into Butler Country jail and charged with holding the woman in her apartment against her will.

He is also facing a felony escape charge.
