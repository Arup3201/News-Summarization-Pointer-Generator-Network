A wedding photographer says she is furious after Ukip activists accidentally printed her mobile number on a giant billboard, leading to her receiving a number of abusive phone calls.

Alexandria Hall, 30, said she had been sworn at and dubbed a racist after her telephone number was displayed on the mobile advertising hoarding as it drove around Surrey.

Ukip have blamed a 'printing error' for the mix up, which saw Ms Hall's contact details used on the poster proclaiming 'Vote Ukip - let's get our country back', and criticising the Conservatives for not fixing potholes in the county.

Wedding photographer Alexandria Hall says she is furious after Ukip activists accidentally printed her mobile number on this giant mobile billboard, leading to her receiving a number of abusive phone calls

Ms Hall, from Walthamstow, east London, said she had been harassed with the calls since Saturday, and had thought at first that it was a joke - until she started receiving abuse over the phone.

'At first I thought it was a joke,' she said. 'But then people started phoning calling me a racist and swearing at me for no reason.

'Now every time the phone rings I get anxious because it's not nice being harassed by people being so aggressive.'

Ms Hall said she was sworn at and called a racist by angry callers who rang her by mistake

She only realised what had happened when a local councillor called her to discuss potholes, and later found photographs of the billboard - complete with her phone number - were being circulated on Twitter. 

Ms Hall said when she spoke to an officer from the party, she was given an apology and told the error was down to a mistake by the printing company. 

'Then the Ukip officer suggested that I could forward the callers on to the correct number as if I was some sort of admin service,' she said.

She says the mix-up may mean she has to change her phone number, and with it the marketing material for her photography business.

'I told him this is seriously detrimental to my business as a photography as this is my work phone and I've spent loads of money marketing it,' she said. 

A Ukip spokesman told MailOnline that Ms Hall's number had been displayed on the billboard after a 'printing error', and that she had accepted the party's apology.

'It was a printing error,' he said. 'I do know someone responsible phoned her up as soon as there was a mistake and apologised profusely. Everyone is human and these things happen.

'It was only up for 24 hours over the weekend and it has gone down now.'

He added: 'We are embarrassed by the situation and sorry for the inconvenience.'
