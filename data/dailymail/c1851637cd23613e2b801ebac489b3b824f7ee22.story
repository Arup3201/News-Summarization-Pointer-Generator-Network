Goodyear believes it has a way to extend your electric car's range through tires that charge the battery as you drive on them.

Unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, the BH-03 concept tires combine thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as the tire rolls. 

'This tire generates electricity through the action of materials in the tire that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions,' Goodyear said in a statement.

Hot idea: The Goodyear BH-03, unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, uses two advanced material technologies to capture extra energy from normal wear and tear

Yahoo! reports that the thermoelectric fibers are woven into the tire, converting energy generated through friction caused by the tire's contact with the road.

Piezoelectric material would also capture energy generated in the normal physical deformation by strain energy harvesting.

It's not clear that the tire could produce the type of energy needed to add significant miles to an electric car's travel radius.

A study published in 2012 in Smart Materials and Structures found  strain energy harvesting through piezoelectric tire materials was feasible, but the experiment looked to power wireless sensors, not an entire vehicle.

The company also unveiled another concept that could take drivers off the beaten path.

Showcasing its new Triple Tube tires on the Lexus LF-SA concept car, Goodyear says the tire design has three tubes that can be inflated or deflated to respond to road conditions.

The tires could change to provide extra grip during high speed driving, increase fuel economy by lowering resistance and even change shape to control against hydroplaning in snow or rain.

CNET points out that Goodyear has used Geneva  to launch forward-thinking - though not quite market-ready - concepts before, having shown off a tire with two separate rings for different road conditions at last year's auto show.

The outer ring of the SUV featured a slick surface with grooves to displace water while driving on a paved road while a smaller inner ring had a textured surface for traction off road.
