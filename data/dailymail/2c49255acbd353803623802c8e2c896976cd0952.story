Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed as she taught  at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April

The husband of a teacher who was stabbed to death in a classroom has paid tribute to his 'beautiful, loving' wife ahead of a memorial service to celebrate her life.

Hundreds of people are expected to gather today for a service for teacher Ann Maguire, 61, who was stabbed as she taught a Spanish lesson at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds.

The 61-year-old, who died from multiple stab wounds following the attack in April, has been described as a 'beautiful, dedicated and hard-working individual' by her family.

The mother-of-two had taught at the school for more than 40 years prior to the attack and was due to retire this month.

Her husband Don, 62, told the BBC he hoped the service at Leeds Town Hall today would reflect who she was.

'Ann was a very loving dedicated wife and a natural mother and it was her natural mothering qualities that I think made Ann such a wonderful teacher,' he said.

'She was a beautiful, dedicated, hard-working individual, so I hope that and the fact she had a very strong faith is reflected in this service.'

The many tributes which followed her death, the first killing of a teacher in a British school since the Dunblane massacre in 1996, brought comfort and solace to the family, he said.

The service will be led by Rev Monsignor John Wilson of the Catholic Diocese of Leeds and organisers say it will be 'a celebration of Mrs Maguire's life in song, on screen and through words'.

A tribute video has been created in which people who knew Mrs Maguire share their memories of her and how she affected their lives. The video will be shown during the service and will be relayed to screens outside.

Her daughter Emma told the BBC: 'I think what we took away was that we have so many of our own stories and memories of Mummy and we are so grateful people chose to share theirs.'

Members of the public have been invited to join her family, colleagues, pupils and civic dignitaries.

Those attending the service as well as schools across Leeds will take part in a minute's silence at about 12.30pm.

Mrs Maguire's death on April 28 sent shockwaves through Britain and provoked an outpouring of sympathetic tributes from around the world.

Flowers and messages pinned on the fences outside the school gates stretched for more than 100 metres.

Many of the messages were from current and former pupils but others were from strangers who wanted to register their sadness.

Around 300 people attended Mrs Maguire's funeral Mass in May.

The couple have two grown-up daughters - professional dancer Emma, who has been a member of the Royal Ballet since 2002, and osteopath Kerry, who also trained as a ballerina.

Mrs Maguire also brought up two of her nephews - Daniel and Andrew Poole - as her own sons after her sister Eileen's death from cancer in 1986 at 35.

The Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund has been set up in her memory to provide bursaries and funding for the enhancement and personal development of young people through music, drama, language and dance.

In July a court heard a 16-year-old boy had accepted responsibility for the 'unlawful killing' of the teacher.

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared via video link at Leeds Crown Court, which heard a trial on a murder charge was due to begin in November.
