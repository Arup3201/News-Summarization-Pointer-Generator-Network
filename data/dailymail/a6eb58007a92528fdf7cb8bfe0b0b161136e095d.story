Convicted murderer Jodi Arias was pictured yawning in court yesterday as a jury prepares to decide whether she will be given the death penalty for the brutal killing of her ex-boyfriend.

The former waitress, 34, from California, looked somewhat bored with proceedings during the retrial of her sentencing at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix.

Arias was convicted of murder last year for stabbing and slashing secret lover Travis Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead in 2008.

On Tuesday, it was revealed that she was allowed to testify as a witness in secret during the sentencing retrial in Arizona because of fears for her safety after her lawyers said she received death threats.

Arias' lawyers had told the court that she did not feel she would be 'able to fully communicate what she wanted to say, communicate her remorse and go through all the mitigating factors and get them out there in front of the jury with the public here'.

A three-member panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals said the trial judge, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens, agreed to the request from Arias' legal team despite feeling manipulated by the defendant.

A state appeals court ruled last month that the judge had been wrong to close those proceedings to the public, and the appeals court on Tuesday confirmed suspicions that Arias herself had been the mystery witness in question.

At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive

'A defendant who testified in open court during the guilt phase of the trial cannot decide she will only testify in the penalty phase if the press and public are excluded and her testimony is sealed until after any verdict,' the appeals court wrote. 

After murdering Mr Alexander, Arias left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home.

She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he had attacked her.

Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman

Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment.

Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option.

If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed as an option, leaving a judge to sentence Arias to one of two options: life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years.

At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive.

Her first trial drew a global following and inspired spectators to wait in line in the middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom.

The cost to Arizona taxpayers for Jodi Arias' defense now tops $2.7million and the figure will keep rising as her penalty phase retrial continues.
