BT Sport has boosted its European football line-up by securing the rights to broadcast World Cup champions Germany’s home friendly matches.

The coverage excludes matches involving teams from the British Isles, but will commence with the mouth-watering re-run of the 2014 World Cup Final, pitting Joachim Low’s side against Argentina on September 3.

In addition, the broadcaster has secured the rights to the DFB Cup, Germany’s prime domestic football cup competition, the equivalent of England’s FA Cup.

The deals build on BT Sport’s expanding European football line-up which already includes Italy’s Serie A, France’s Ligue 1, and, Germany’s Bundesliga, which features the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Goetze who powered Germany to success in the World Cup final in Brazil.

Paul Scholes has also dealt another blow to Sky's long-held supremacy in the football broadcasting by signing for BT Sport as a pundit on a four-year-deal, having made his TV debut on Sky last season.

BT Sport have also announced it has signed a deal for up to four exclusively live matches a week from the Portuguese Primeira Liga. The Portuguese rights include exclusively live home and away matches played by the league’s ‘Big Three’ teams, current league champions Benfica, Porto FC and Sporting Lisbon.
