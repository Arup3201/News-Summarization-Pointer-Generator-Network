Police caught up with a 'person of interest' on Monday in the gruesome massacre of four women in an Oklahoma apartment.

Joseph Tillman, 33, was arrested yesterday during a traffic stop in Independence, Kansas, on an outstanding warrant for a domestic assault and battery case, police revealed today.

While police have been looking to speak with Tillman, he has not been named a suspect in the murder of twins Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55.

Caught: Joseph Tillman, a 'person of interest' in the grisly murder, was taken into custody yesterday in Kansas

Police told the Tulsa World that Tillman has been 'known to frequent' the 61st Street and Peoria Avenue area, a crime-ridden location and the scene of the horrific murders on Monday.

Cops are now working to have Tillman transported back to Tulsa.

The arrest came just after a mother of one of the victims spoke out about how her daughter was getting her life back together when it was tragically cut short.

Misty Nunley's mother, Cheryl Nunley, said her 33-year-old daughter had befriended Rebeika Powell and had been staying with her on and off in the apartment for the past week.

She said she called her daughter nearly every morning to check in, and spoke to her Monday - just hours before the women were found shot to death.

'She had positive people back in her 
life,' Cheryl Nunley told The Associated Press, holding back tears while
sitting with family and friends in a tiny apartment a few blocks away 
from the crime scene.

'She's not perfect. She ran around 
with some people she shouldn't have been running around with, but she 
was getting her life back together.'

Misty Nunley was found murdered on Monday, along with the twins - both mothers of young children - and Julie Jackson, 55.

Also in the apartment was a 3-year-old boy who is believed to have witnessed the entire shooting. He was unharmed.

Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday.

Relatives and neighbors have told Nunley's family there may have been a romantic spat between one of the women who lived at the apartment and a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend.

Police wouldn't comment on those rumors.

In an interview with CBS News, Rebeika and Kayetie's grief-stricken father, Larry Powell cried out: 'My life's gone. My kids are gone.'

According
to reports, police and EMS 
workers were called to the apartment near 61st Street and Peoria Avenue 
in the Riverwood section of Tulsa at 12:36pm after an unidentified 
person stumbled across the corpses.

Murdered: The bodies of Rebeika Powell, left, and twin sister Kayetie Melchor, were found in the apartment building with two others

Mystery: Police have not yet determined a suspect or a motive in the killings, which occurred in a crime-ridden area of Tulsa

Mothers: Both of the twins were the mothers of young children

At the run-down apartment complex, 
bed sheets or cardboard hang as improvised draperies in many windows 
behind a black wrought-iron gate.

The
guard shack is empty and signs read 'Curfew 10pm for everyone, 
everyday' and 'Photo ID required to be on property.'

Three of the units 
are burned out and boarded up with plywood.

Riverwood
has long been plagued by crime, and Tulsa police say there were two 
murders in the Fairmont Terrace Apartments in 2012.

Residents say gunfire and break-ins are part of the pattern of their everyday lives.

'We're in the eye of the storm,' says Charles Burke, a 48-year-old construction worker. 'You're on your toes. You can't be too careful.'

Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years.

She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday.

'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says. 'Usually, it's bad when it gets hot.'

Mystery: Officers have canvassed the area for witnesses but have yet to determine a motive or lead

Neighbor Ladawn Mack, a 25-year-old cashier, says she's used to seeing police cars in the street, and that Monday's quadruple homicide is enough to make her take extra precautions.

'We have a house alarm and I've always had a gun for my home,' Mack said.

Resident Alexis Draite, 20, recently moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City, believing it to be safer.

Her strategy for staying alive: 'Lock the doors, lock the cars and don't stay outside longer than you need to.'

Anyone with information on the case can contact Crime Stoppers at 918-596-COPS.
