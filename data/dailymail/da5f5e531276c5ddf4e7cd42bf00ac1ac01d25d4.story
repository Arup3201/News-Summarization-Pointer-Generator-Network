Life-long battle: Shobna Gulati's hair started falling out after her father died when she was 19

She is known to millions of Coronation Street and Loose Women viewers  for having a Bollywood-worthy bouffant.

But today Shobna Gulati reveals the truth: she has waged a life-long battle with thinning hair.

Although afflicted since her teens, her most severe bout began two years ago when she noticed visible patches of scalp and found clumps of hair on brushes and her pillow, and clogging up the shower plughole.

Shobna, 47, says: ‘An inch fell out from all around my hairline, and I had bald patches in my parting all over the top of my head that were up to a centimetre wide.

‘I felt dreadful and unattractive, and panicked that it was all going to come out.

'I’d leave my hair down  to try to disguise it or use brown eye shadow to cover up the bald patches.

'I was miserable and hated looking  at pictures of myself.’

About 40 per cent of women will experience some degree of hair loss by the age of 50 due to hormonal changes.

But female pattern baldness remains a taboo subject, and Shobna hopes that by speaking out she will reassure others.

She also wants to offer hope as, using supplements made from sea algae, she is regaining her locks.

Shobna first discovered her hair was thinning after her father died and she moved out of her family home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, aged 19.

‘Both the trauma of my father dying and the change of  diet had an impact on my hair,’ she recalls. ‘I skipped meals and didn’t eat as well as I could have done.’

Temporary hair loss can be accelerated by stress, poor diet and weight loss. While it generally lasts only six months, Shobna’s continued until, at 27, pregnancy caused a rise in oestrogen. It stopped her hair falling out and it looked fuller again.

But three months after the birth of son Akshay, her hair started falling out again and Shobna – who split up with her baby’s father while she was pregnant – struggled to cope. ‘It was something else to deal with in addition to the upheaval of single motherhood,’ she says. ‘It was a mess.’

When Shobna found fame in 1998 playing Anita in sitcom Dinnerladies, her thinning hair wasn’t initially a concern – it was neatly tucked away under a hat. But things changed when she joined Coronation Street in 2001.

‘On screen, with it all blow-dried, it looked fine,’ she says. ‘But I secretly hated what I looked like. As a shop girl I’d be asked to wear my hair up. As I got more comfortable with the make-up girls, I’d ask them to leave some curly bits at the front to make it look fuller.’

Being subjected to the paparazzi forced Shobna to fake a full head  of hair. ‘Clip-in extensions became my favourite accessory,’ she says.

In 2006, on a three-year break from the soap, she cut her hair short and bleached it. But it ended up even more brittle.

‘The peroxide killed it. As my hair grew I had weaves put in [in which hair extensions are sewn on to the hair], but my hair was so weak it broke.’

She returned to the cobbles and the role of Sunita in 2009, dyeing her hair brown to make it look fuller.

THE hair loss Shobna suffers is  a surprisingly common problem and very distressing.

Nutritional deficiency can be  the cause, particularly with iron store levels, which need to be  at a certain level for good hair growth. If a diet is lacking in nutrients, supplements can help.

Commonly hair loss will be caused by thyroid problems or fungal scalp infections or will start post-pregnancy, and in these situations supplements would be unlikely to help.

In many patients with female alopecia, there seems to be no obvious underlying cause, but often the hair loss spontaneously improves whether or not a supplement is taken, usually after six months.

These pills are unlikely to completely reverse hair loss in most women, but for the chance of some improvement they are worth a try.

‘The Only Way Is Essex was popular and everyone wanted big hair,’ she says. ‘I bought into the trend with clip-in extensions – I looked like a Barbie doll.’

By 2012, as she left the Street, her hair had really started to fall out.

‘During my last year I was under a lot of stress over the change in my career and my relationship,’ says Shobna, who split with boyfriend Anthony Brown, 31, last July.

Adrenal ‘stress’ glands secrete male hormones into the body, causing hair loss. She was also approaching the menopause, which affects levels of oestrogen too.

Low iron levels and thyroid disorders can also contribute, but the most common form of female hair loss – a condition called androgenetic alopecia – happens when the follicles become sensitive to normal levels of male hormones in the body.

The main treatment is minoxidil, which is applied to the scalp and stimulates blood supply to encourage regrowth. Steroid injections can also help by suppressing the immune system, which is thought to damage follicles.

But Shobna says: ‘I didn’t feel ill and didn’t want to waste my doctor’s time. I didn’t see my hair loss as an illness. I was embarrassed and would have found it too difficult to talk about. It was like saying the word “balding” would make it worse.’

After finishing filming last March, Shobna had extensions to boost her self-esteem. ‘They were marvellous but they weren’t good for my hair, she says. ‘It grew dry and horrible, and every time the extensions came out I felt worse.’

In January she turned to supplements – those on the market include Nourkrin, Nanogen, Hairfollic and Viviscal – containing vitamins, minerals and marine extracts that can make hair grow stronger.

‘I was sceptical,’ admits Shobna.  ‘I worried it would be a waste of money.’ But, in conjunction with a healthy diet, she believes they have made a difference, and two months ago she took out her extensions.

‘I’m not saying this is the solution for everyone but it feels as if I have more hair,’ she says. ‘It feels healthier and more invigorated. I feel like I have taken action and not let the beginnings of the menopause take control of who I am.’
