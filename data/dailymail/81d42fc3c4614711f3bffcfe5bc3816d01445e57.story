Nigel Farage warned Thursday night in America that the U.S. Republican party will become a dinosaur – not an elephant – if it continues to embrace the political center.

'I suspect that if the Republican Party sticks with the establishment it will lose,' he told Daily Mail Online after a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference.

The GOP 'has got to reach the Hispanic community, but it's also got to reach that blue-collar community that Reagan got to vote for him in huge numbers. I'm not sure at the moment that they're positioning themselves to do that.'

CPAC is an annual three-day mecca for constitutional evangelists, anti-Obamacare shock troops, full-throated abortion opponents and gun rights activists. Many of them think the Republican Party is only slightly less liberal and nanny-statist than the president.

Farage fit right in, keeping backstage handlers waiting for his appointment to test a lapel microphone while he smoked a cigar in the cold, outside the Maryland resort hotel where more than a thousand stayed into the dinner hour to hear him.

'WE'RE NOT THE TEA PARTY': Nigel Farage, whose UK Independence Party is challenging both Tories and Liberals, said his is a real political force, not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party

The Conservative Political Action Conference brings all manner of right-wingers to a hotel in Maryland each year

'I think the Republican Party is going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain,' he said in an interview backstage. 

The British political contrarian, long at the helm of the UK Independence Party, plied the conservative audience with a dry-witted vision of how his political travails could show disaffected American right-wingers the way forward.

UKIP, he boasted, is 'an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels.'

But don't confuse him with the tea party, he said after the applause ended.

'We're not the tea party,' Farage insisted one-on-one. 'Our job is not to influence one political party. We're not an outlier from the Tories.'

And unlike the tea party phenomenon, which peels off disaffected Republicans who believe their traditional party has moved too far left, he said, his group 'is not just retired half-colonels who've always voted Conservative and now they're UKIP. We're dragging them from across the spectrum.'

Farage's rhetoric about immigration, Britain's Judeo-Christian foundation, political correctness and regulation run amok made up a song he sang to a crowd that had already memorized the verses.

'If you discuss immigration, it means you're a bad person,' he complained – 'that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else.'

And Farage spared no harsh words for Barack Obama, saying that he sees 'an American president who doesn't have the courage' to fight against Islamist terror.

Obama, he claimed, lacks the vision to see 'what has gone wrong, and why those three people were arrested on the streets of the USA yesterday.'

That was a reference to the trio of Muslim men who were detained by the FBI after they began the process of traveling to Syria for training with the ISIS terror army – with the intention of bringing death and destruction back to America. 

'We must stand firm and defend our Judeo-Christian culture,' Farage said, earnign his first boisterous applause. 'We must make it clear that we believe in common law and not Shariah law.'

He called radical Islam 'an enemy within' both the U.S. and the UK.

Farage also told Daily Mail Online that Prime Minister David Cameron's government was wrong to ask The Washington Post and other news outlets to withhold the name of London resident Mohammed Emwazi, who the paper identified on Thursday as the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.'

'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.'

Farage said 'the Republican Party is going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain'

'If you discuss immigration, it means you're a bad person,' he complained to a thousand convention-goers – 'that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else'

He was quick, as always, to link talk of ISIS to Britain's immigration 'crisis,' consisting of a doors-wide-open policy to the rest of the European Union. 

'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.'

He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.'

'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 

'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.'

'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it.'

Is that xenophobic? Farage doesn't think so.

'The thing about us,' he said of the UK, 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.'

While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.'

UKIP typically sees its share of trouble in the British press, usually when one of its own makes a public gaffe worthy of Joe Biden. 

CPAC's lineup includes Sarah Palin, whose teleprompter played tricks on her last month in Iowa, leaving her rambling for minutes

The CPAC conference draws conservatives from all over the US, but they share the same message

Like any political force testing its boundaries by casting a wide net, it would be recognizable to American conservatives who have had to contend with their own brand of bad publicity.

Todd Akin, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, famously self-imploded after musing on whether abortions should be allowed in cases of 'legitimate rape.'

Sarah Palin just last month lost track of her teleprompter during a key Iowa speech and rambled aimlessly for what seemed like hours, causing some to wonder if she was intoxicated.

An ocean away, UKIP councillor Rozanne Duncan was kicked out this month after she was filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features.'

And social media accounts belonging to UKIP activist Richard Crouch were plastered recently with claims that his home town of Leicester is a 'sh*thole' and 'full of P***s.'

His Facebook account called Asians 'The Taliban' and labeled Romanians 'pick pocketing criminals.'

Crouch insisted that his account was hacked, but the damage was done.

Farage threw up his hands and suggested that idiots will be idiots. 

'Well, look,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'people like Rozanne Duncan are local councillors. They are very low-level people in UKIP. They're not major players.'

'Yes, we get people who say stupid things in UKIP. I don't approve or condone any of it.'
