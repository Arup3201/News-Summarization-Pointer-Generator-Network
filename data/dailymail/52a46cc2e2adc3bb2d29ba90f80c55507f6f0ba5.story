NBC's Bob Costas said Tuesday that his anti-gun rant, which he delivered during Sunday night football programming, was largely misunderstood.

Costas told sports radio host Dan Patrick that 90 seconds wasn't enough time for him to 'flesh out' what he meant to say when he criticized U.S. gun laws as too lenient, and suggested that those laws are to blame for the murder-suicide of the NFL's Jovan Belcher.

'What I was trying to say was, that if you want some perspective on this, there are a number of issues related to [Belcher's murder-suicide] that we could begin to talk about and think about,' Costas said. 'The problem was that I didn't have enough time to get to many of them. And that, I think, was my mistake to be quite honest.'

Unexpected: Bob Costas, who has been on the air for NBC Sports television since the early 1980s, angered viewers after advocating for gun control during a Sunday night football game

Costas went on to say that he meant to bring attention to domestic violence issues as well as gun rights issues.

'I'm thinking I can't address all of 
the possible aspects of this,' he said. 'Domestic violence - the 
possibility of athletes, especially athletes who play a violent sport 
are more prone to domestic violence than people the same age elsewhere 
in society.

'The possible connection between football and this particular
 tragedy. We know that football is connected, and it's effects are 
connected to other situations. We don't know yet whether it's connected 
to Belcher, but that's certainly a question that could be asked. The 
easy availability of guns is another.'

Costas said he made the mistake of 
breaking one of his cardinal broadcasting rules, which is to avoid delving into 
touchy subjects unless there is enough time to flesh them out.

'I had maybe 50 seconds total for 
this -- my implication was a bit of perspective, here's one aspect of 
it,' he said. 'So I think that my mistake there was that I left it open 
to too much interpretation.'

In his initial remarks about guns 
that sparked outrage among supporters of gun rights, the 60-year-old 
Queens, New York, native paraphrased and quoted from a piece by Fox 
Sports columnist Jason Whitlock, formerly of the Kansas City Star.

Costas praised the emotive column
 and told his viewers, ‘In the coming days, Jovan Belcher's actions and 
their possible connection to football will be analyzed. Who knows? But 
here, wrote Jason Whitlock, is what I believe.

‘If Jovan Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.’

On Saturday, December 1, Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend Perkins, 22, the mother of his 3-month-old daughter.

Belcher
 then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, his team’s home stadium in Kansas 
City, Missouri, and shot himself in the parking lot of its practice 
facility.

Family and friends said the two had endured a 'strained relationship' that had intensified after the birth of their daughter.

The online reaction to Costas' remarks came fast, with many viewers criticizing the sportscaster for voicing his personal and political opinions on a program meant for entertainment.

‘The Media Left at Halftime: Bob Costas pushing gun control, quoting...who else?..a sports writer on ridding the country of the 2nd Amendment,’ wrote television host Lou Dobbs, who uses the Twitter handle @loudobbsnews

‘Bob Costas, who’s gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men’s bodies and brains, gives us a little civics lecture,’ wrote Fox commentator Andrew Levy, who uses the Twitter handle @andylevy

‘Yes, Bob Costas, guns are the problem. Nicole Brown Simpson would be alive today if OJ hadn't shot her with that knife,’ wrote Twitter user @ToddKincannon

‘NRA gonna' be PISSSED at Bob Costas,’ wrote Twitter user @JeremyStahl

Judging from about 100 tweets, more than 95 per cent of those quickest to respond to Costas' remarks expressed annoyance and outright disagreement, with only a few in favor.

National Post sports columnist Bruce Arthur, who uses the Twitter handle @bruce_arthur, was one of the few on the micro-blogging site to agree with the remarks.

‘Bob Costas just quoted Jason Whitlock, and the whole thing made perfect sense,’ he wrote.

Costas has been on the air for NBC Sports television since the early 1980s.
