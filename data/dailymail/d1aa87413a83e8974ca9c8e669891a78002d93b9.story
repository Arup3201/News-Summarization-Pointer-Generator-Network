British taxpayers may have to pay more money to Brussels to cover the rising cost of pensions for EU civil servants and MEPs.

This year the pension bill for EU officials jumped by more than seven per cent to £1.3 billion.

Growing costs mean the EU now has a £36 billion pension time bomb, with Britain expected to pay a £4 billion share.

The European Parliament in Brussels - British taxpayers may have to pay more money to cover the rising cost of pensions for EU civil servants and MEPs after the pension bill jumped by seven per cent to £1.3 billion

The pension bill for EU officials jumped more than seven per cent to £1.3billion this year.

The EU’s total pension liabilities now stand at are £35.8 billion (€45.7bn), according to the latest figures for 2013.

EU auditors have warned the cost of paying the pensions will be a major factor in pushing up British contributions to the Brussels budget.

A British government spokesman said: ‘At a time when governments have taken significant actions to reduce the costs of their public sector, including commitments fundamental reviews of staff pension schemes, the EU institutions must reflect the very difficult decisions which are being made right across Europe.’

The average annual pension received by retired EU officials was over £40,000 in 2012. 

The highest ranking officials can pocket £85,000.

According to figures from 2013, the average retirement age for EU officials was 61.

Much of the soaring EU pensions bill is due to the increasing cost of paying for retired MEPs.

A scheme created by the European Parliament in 2009, which is currently worth £13,760 for each five year time served as MEP, is 100 per cent taxpayer-funded, with MEPs making no contributions.

EU auditors have said that a ceiling capping payments at a maximum of £809 billion billion between 2014 and 2020 may not be enough to pay EU bills, including the pensions.

They have warned that this could lead to extra contributions from taxpayers across Europe.

If the EU spends right up to the payment ceiling, which now seems likely, British contributions to the EU would rise to £13billion a year over the next six years – a significant rise on the previous £11.3billion record high paid last year.

Britain already faces an extra £474million bill over the next two years after MEPs earlier this month voted through additional spending that will cost the Treasury £379million this year and £95m next year.

These demands are over and above the £1.7billion surcharge Britain faces because of its better economic performance compared to the rest of Europe.
