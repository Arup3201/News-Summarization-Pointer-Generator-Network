For any Brad Pitt fans, it's the ultimate offer.

Groupon is selling a unique £15,000 holiday-of-a-lifetime to the States, which includes the chance to meet the A-list Legends Of The Fall actor.

The one-off package holiday also includes exclusive access to an after 
party where platinum-selling artists such as Bruno Mars and the Kings Of
 Leon will be performing.

The amazing trip marks the launch of a 
deal between the discount website and Make It Right - a foundation which
 builds environmentally friendly homes for people in need.

Pitt founded the organisation and the package, called the Epic Deal, will include a tour of a Make It Right site in New Orleans.

The lucky winner will also attend a gala in New Orleans, Louisiana, with cocktails, a 
three-course dinner and jazz music associated with the city - where they'll get to meet the 50-year-old actor.

The
fan will also be able to take a plus one on the 
three-night trip which includes a return airfare.

Groupon CEO Eric Lefkofsky said: ‘We've been helping to build and support communities around our thousands of local merchants since our inception.

‘By partnering with Make It Right we're able to expose millions of people around the world to this important project.

‘We want to help the organisation make a
 significant difference, one that should be replicated in struggling 
neighbourhoods across the world.’

The three-night trip from May 16 includes first class air travel from the UK to Louis Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans.

Guests will stay in suites in the W Hotel, which is just seconds from the renowned French Quarter in the city.

Two VIP tickets to the Make it Right gala and the after party are also included. The event will be raising money to build
 homes for people in need, including victims of Hurricane Katrina in New
 Orleans, disabled veterans in New Jersey, children leaving foster care 
in Kansas City, and Native Americans on the Fort Peck Reservation in 
Montana.

Night to remember: The winner will get to see The Kings Of Leon perform at the Make It Right gala

Ultimate holiday: The three-night adventure in New Orleans includes taking in the sights of the city

Luxury hotel: The £15,000 package includes W Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana

Thousands of homes were left devastated by Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans in August 2005.

More
 than 1,800 people lost their lives and 250,000 homes were destroyed - 
which is why Make It Right are building affordable, high-quality housing
 in the city.

A free prize 
draw will also give one lucky couple from Britain, France or Germany the
 chance to win the A-List Hollywood celebrity package on April 22.
