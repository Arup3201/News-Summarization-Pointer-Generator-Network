With Arsenal legend Thierry Henry announcing his departure from the New York Red Bulls last weekend, rumours have been circulating of a return to north London.

Arsene Wenger's future as Gunners boss looks to be secure despite growing unrest amongst a section of the Arsenal faithful which has even led to Henry being linked with a management role at his beloved club. 

We asked JustArsenal fansite's Bob Allcock whether the club's leading scorer should make a return to the Emirates.

It has not happened yet, but after Thierry Henry announced the end of his playing career with New York Red Bulls this week, the flying Frenchman dropped a huge hint that he would like to come back to work with the Gunners and his mentor Arsene Wenger again.

This is fantastic news for Arsenal fans. We still hold Henry in our hearts as one of the greatest Gunners ever.

Unlike some players, there is no animosity at all about his decision to leave. At the time there was some doubt about the manager’s future as David Dein had left but it was clear when he came back on loan in 2012 that he was still loved unanimously by the Arsenal fans.

His winning goal in an FA Cup game against Leeds in his first game back was one of the best moments I can remember.

And of course his 30 Premier League goals that spearheaded the Gunners’ famous 'invincible' season will always be one of the greatest achievements of any player and club anywhere.

Little wonder Henry is one of only three players, with Tony Adams and Dennis Bergkamp, to have a statue outside the ground.

It was not just his success on the pitch. The success he helped Arsenal achieve in his eight seasons with us makes him so loved by Gooners.

The way Henry played, with style, panache, pace, verve and Va Va Voom, epitomises the football that we have become famous for under Wenger. Henry was a true entertainer and was worth the ticket price on his own.

At the same time as he called time on his time with the MLS club, which almost certainly means the end of his playing days, the 37-year old changed the picture on his Twitter page to one of the Emirates Stadium.

So while our all-time record goal scorer takes a few weeks to consider his options and think about what to do now, it seems clear that a return to north London is in the forefront of his mind.

We already knew that Arsenal was the club in Henry’s heart, as he has made no secret of it since moving to Barcelona back in 2007.

And Wenger has also stated that he expects Henry to come back to Arsenal one day, although he also said that our former star needs to have a real job at the club instead of being merely a figurehead.

That would definitely suit the fans, who would love to see Henry working with either the first team or the academy players. 

Not only does he have an obvious passion for the Gunners, his career shows that he loves the game and with his intelligence, that would surely make him a fantastic coach and role model.

Whether Henry has it in him to one day become a top class manager remains to be seen, but the idea of Wenger’s greatest success as a coach taking his place in charge of Arsenal one day is a dream situation for us Gooners.

Come home Thierry, Arsenal awaits with open arms!
