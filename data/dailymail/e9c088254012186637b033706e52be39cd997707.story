Paula Smith, 46, admitted taking the money from Walton-le-Dale Junior Football Club, near Preston, Lancashire - a crime which almost bankrupted the club

A mother stole more than £14,000 from a junior football team after volunteering as the club's treasurer.

Paula Smith, 46, admitted taking the money from Walton-le-Dale Junior Football Club, near Preston, Lancashire - a crime which almost bankrupted the club.

She has been told that she does not have to pay back a penny - a move that has angered the club's authorities.

The club was left with just £13.66 in the bank when the theft was discovered.

Walton-le-Dale Junior Football Club representatives today claimed that Smith treated herself to holidays in the Caribbean, two new cars and designer clothes throughout her four-year deception.

Smith, who coached the under-10s and acted as the club treasurer, was handed a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 180 hours community service.

She was arrested last September and charged with various counts of theft on December 3.

She pleaded guilty to theft of £6,900 
between September 2007 and May 2009 and £7,250 between June 2009 and 
July 2010 at a later court hearing, and was sentenced in mid-August.

Executive members of the club first 
raised the alarm last year after spotting anomalies with the accounts, 
which were handled by Smith, from Walton-le-Dale, when they started 
receiving warnings for unpaid bills that they thought had been paid.

After going over the books, they 
discovered the club owed around £5,000 to Wellington Park in Leyland, 
where they hosted two sportsman's dinners to raise money for the club.

They also owned thousands of pounds 
to local schools where teams used indoor facilities to train in the 
winter and hundreds to the Lancashire FA.

In the wake of the ordeal dozens of parents removed their children from the club.

Three teams, affecting around 40 local children, also were cut because they could not afford to keep them running.

But club officials are furious after Preston Crown Court did not impose an order for her to pay back the cash.

Mark Atkinson, vice-chairman of the club, said it was almost 'ruined by one woman's greed'.

He said: 'We are a community club that is here to provide a service to hundreds of local families.

'We teach the youngsters football, but we are also supposed to be a positive force teaching them about right and wrong.

'We trusted her and she was stealing from us all along. It was lie after lie with her.

'To in effect steal from children and your own community is unforgivable.'
