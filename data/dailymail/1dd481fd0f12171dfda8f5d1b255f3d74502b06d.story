Game show viewers were left outraged by a buzzer's failure to ring out on Wednesday night's Family Feud, which saw a family miss out on winning a brand-new car.

Team captains Matt Molloy and Mary Ryan were facing off at sudden death when the controversial moment happened.

If the Ryans won they would have become the brand-new champions of the show, while the Molloys would have walked away with a Mitsubishi Outlander four-wheel-drive. 

Viewers were outraged when the Molloy family were beaten out by the Ryan family on Family Feud when a buzzer appeared to malfunction

Host Grant Denyer asked the pair to 'name something you might eat with egg'.

In footage of the show, Mr Molloy is seen pushing down on the buzzer first to answer but no sound comes from it.

A split second later, Ms Ryan reacts but her buzzer rings out much to the surprise of herself, Denyer, her opponent and the audience - who let out a big collective groan.

The female contestant had to check the light below her button had been illuminated before she ventured to answer.

Denyer pauses for a few moments but in the end he allows Ms Ryan to answer the question with 'bacon', winning her family their title.

Mr Molloy who is visibly disappointed walks back to his team with a confused look on his face.

It appears he was not alone in his reaction. 

Angry viewers took to social media to vent their frustration at the oversight.

'Matt hit it first... no doubt... I think family feud owe it to the molloy family to return to the show,' one woman wrote.

'For family feud to post this statement you obviously have recieved an outcry from your viewers. #Bringbackthemolloys.'

While another accused network of rigging the outcome: 'Clearly @channelten don't have the budget to give away a car. He [Mr Molloy] clearly hit the button first.'

The show was slammed with so much criticism that they released a statement in relation to the incident later on Wednesday.

'The Molloy family missed out on the car tonight in a very close Sudden Death segment,' the statement said.

'Mary hit the buzzer with a greater velocity and held it down, activating the buzzer’s electronic trigger.'

Family Feud's technical experts also added: 'The buzzers are wired to identical electronic relays - as soon as one buzzer is "closed" (triggered), the other one is disabled.

'Mary’s relay has definitely been triggered first.'
