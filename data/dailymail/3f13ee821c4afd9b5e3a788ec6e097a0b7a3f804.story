Convicted sex offenders are continuing to live near a 'ready supply of available targets' by moving close to schools despite new laws designed to keep them away from children, it was revealed today.

A new study has found that paedophiles and sexual predators move far more often than the general U.S. population, with a high proportion of them relocating to banned zones.

For a new book, Crime Modeling and Mapping Using Geospatial Technologies, researchers tracked the movements of more than 1,000 sex offenders in Hamilton County, Ohio, from 2005 to 2007.

Still a problem: Dangerous sex offenders are continuing to live near schools despite new laws designed to keep them away from children, a new study has claimed (file picture)

They found 65.2 per cent changed homes over that period compared to just 13.6 per cent of non-convicts who moved in 2007.

Of the most dangerous offenders, classed as sexual predators, more than 35 per cent moved into school zones, while just 31.9 per cent of less serious 'sexually orientated offenders' chose to do so.

Some offenders already lived in school areas at the start of the study and simply moved to one to another, it was reported by www.buzzfeed.com.

Lead researcher Alan Murray said the study revealed a 'preference by offenders to reside in areas that have been deemed off limits by enacted residential laws'.

This, he said, may 'indicate strategic movements to areas with a ready supply of available targets'.

But the book acknowledges that offenders might simply prefer these areas because they may have better access to rehabilitation facilities.

Crackdown: Megan's law was brought in after the death of seven-year-old Megan Kanka (above) who was raped and murdered by a neighbour who had two previous convictions for sexual assault

The study authors claim the results show 
that increasingly stringent laws aimed at keeping offenders away from 
school areas were still allowing them to 'move freely about communities'
and thereby giving residents and politicians a false sense of security.

California became the first state to have a sex offender registration program in 1947, but it was nearly 50 years later before community notification of convicts came into force.

In 1994, the Jacob Wetterling Act required all 50 states to force sex offenders to register with state registries.

Then, two years later, the so-called Megan's Law required law enforcement authorities to make information available to the public.

The changes were brought in following the death of seven-year Megan Kanka, who was raped and murdered by neighbour Jesse Timmendequas, who had two previous convictions for sexually assaulting young girls.

The law is enacted and enforced on a state-by-state basis, but most restrict where convicts can live after their release from prison.

Many prevent residency within 300-600m of schools and daycare centres.Â 

In 2007, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act implemented new uniform requirements across the states, including a new national registry.

All 50 states have since passed laws requiring sex offenders, especially paedophiles, to register with police and report where they live after leaving prison.
