The club made famous by The Beatles has filed a lawsuit against the multi-million dollar Hard Rock Café over the use of its name.

The Cavern Club in Mathew Street, Liverpool is where the Fab Four played 292 gigs in the early Sixties before Beatlemania swept the globe.

The American music-themed restaurant secured the rights to the name 20 years ago in the US and Mexico and there is a Hard Rock Cavern Club in Boston and Mexico.

But the owners of the English club - which include John Lennon's sister Julia Baird – are taking the Florida-based Hard Rock Café to court in Orlando over the US rights.

The US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board gave Hard Rock Café International rights to the name Cavern Club in the United States in 1994.

Hard Rock Café Inc has registered the US rights to use the Cavern Club name for any room at its outlets in United States and Mexico.

Memorabilia from rock icons Aerosmith, Nirvana, Bon Jovi, Van Halen and The Grateful Dead adorns the walls of the Boston venue although none of them ever played the Liverpool club.

Stars like The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks, all played at The Cavern in its heyday and more recently Adele launched her second album there.

On December 14, 1999, Sir Paul McCartney marked the end of the millennium and the release of his new LP with a gig at club in Liverpool.

More than 75,000 Beatles fans make a pilgrimage annually to Mathew Street to see where the Mop Tops honed their sound and were signed by Brian Epstein in 1961.

Cavern Club director Dave Jones said: ‘It's an outrageous, insinuated claim to an association with fame that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Hard Rock Café.

‘We are very much the David in this battle against Goliath.

‘The Cavern doesn't look for a fight, it's not in our nature, but we owe it to every music lover on the planet to get this put right.

‘If this dispute is not put right perhaps in some decades time kids might be confused into believing that the four lads who actually changed the world from a cellar bar in Liverpool instead started out at a Hard Rock.

‘That would be a travesty of history and a tragedy for music heritage.’

The Cavern Club owns the trademark for the name in Britain, all of Europe, Australia and China.

The Hard Rock Café is owned by the Orlando-based Seminole tribe who bought the chain, which began in London in 1971, in 2007 for $965million.

The chairman of the Seminole Tribal Council James E. Billie is a Grammy-nominated musician for a song on his 1999 album Alligator Tales.

The Cavern have pleaded for him to personally intervene and quipped that he and his band can perform a gig at the legendary night spot.

Cavern Club director Bill Heckle said: ‘We are sure that as a musician Chief Jim Billie will see the history and the right to our claim.

‘This trademark row began long before the Seminole tribe took ownership of the Hard Rock, so we don't consider it's of their making.

‘If Chief Jim Billie instructs the Hard Rock to try to see it our way not only will right be done but we'll put him and his band on at The Cavern Club as part of the deal.’

Hard Rock Café did not respond to requests for comment.

The Cavern Club closed in 1973 and reopened in 1984 on the same site

Jazz was the genre of music originally performed at the Cavern Club on Liverpool’s Mathew Street when it opened on a cold January Wednesday in 1957.

It was opened by Alan Sytner who wanted to emulate the Parisian jazz clubs that he had enjoyed visiting.

The first act to play at the club was the Merseysippi Jazz Band. After a flirtation with skiffle and blues, it became the centre of Liverpool’s rock scene in the Sixties and The Quarrymen (later The Beatles) were one of many groups who played there.

The Beatles first played the Cavern on 9 February 1961 (the first time George Harrison appeared with them) after returning from Hamburg and exactly nine months later Brian Epstein saw them there.

The Fab Four played there a little under 300 times, the last occurring on August 3, 1963. Epstein promised the club owners that the group would return, a promise that was never kept.

The Cavern Club closed in March 1973 and was filled in during building work on the Merseyrail underground rail loop.

The venue reopened on April 26, 1984 having been rebuilt using many of the old bricks and on the same site – 10 Mathew Street.
