Thought the hairstyles of  the 1980s were just a dim and  distant memory?

Try telling that to Orchard Goldenboy, who looks as though he’s drawn the inspiration for his rather bouffant hairdo straight from Limahl, lead singer of 80s band Kajagoogoo.

But it wouldn’t do to mock his carefully coiffed locks. Because two-year-old budgie Orchard Goldenboy is a chart-topper himself – in fact, he is officially the number one of his kind in the world.

Top prize: Two-year-old budgie Orchard Goldenboy has just been crowned best in show at the Budgerigar Society World Championship and (right) Limahl of Kajagoogoo

He has just been crowned best in show at the Budgerigar Society World Championship, the so-called ‘Crufts for budgies’.

With his eye-catching feather-cut, he’s a little more flamboyant than the average budgie. And little wonder. He’s a pedigree goldenface grey budgie, bred especially to achieve his distinctive looks by Richard Miller and his father Michael, who live near Carlisle.

Pedigree budgies are taller than their ordinary counterparts, usually measuring around 6in. They also have wider faces and large, distinctive neck spots.

The Millers have been breeding budgies for more than 20 years. Richard, now  a 30-year-old partner at a law firm, got  his first one aged eight ‘as a means of appeasing’ him after his parents would not buy him a dog.

His interest grew from there, and today he and  63-year-old Michael keep around 300 budgies in a 32ft by 10ft aviary. Pedigree budgies can be bought for £50. Following his win, however, Orchard Goldenboy could be worth considerably more.

But Richard said: ‘I’m not saying someone would not pay a lot of money for a bird like this.

‘But it would be like selling your  life’s work, it would not be worth it.  You can’t put a value on a bird like this, he is priceless.’
