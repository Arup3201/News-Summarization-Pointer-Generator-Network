George Clooney has persuaded the mayor of the Italian town where he is likely to marry his British fiancée to bring in draconian laws to guarantee his privacy.

Anyone caught swimming within 100metres of his mansion on Lake Como will be fined up to £450 by the local authorities. Pedestrians will also be banned from stopping on the road outside the property, which is in the picturesque Lombardy area of Italy.

The rules suggest that Clooney, 53, favours the property for his wedding to lawyer Amal Alamuddin, 36, over his villa at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

The laws announced by Laglio Council are in operation 24 hours a day until September 30. Notices have been stuck on lampposts in the area with a warning in red type.

Laglio mayor Roberto Pozzi said that in the past there had been ‘unpleasant episodes’ when fans had gone up to Clooney’s windows and yelled out his name.

The new rules were designed to stop them doing the same and to prevent paparazzi from getting too close to his home, he said.

Not welcome: Mayor Roberto Pozzi has banned non-residents to stay near the entrance of Clooney's home

Pozzi said: ‘It is now completely forbidden to stop outside the entrance to Clooney’s villa. It’s a question of traffic and security. It is very dangerous and it’s also an issue of privacy.

‘This type of action is designed to bring about a change in people’s behaviour and create a more peaceful environment. We have to guarantee privacy and security for George Clooney and his guests.’ 

The ban on congregating behind the house 
is because the street is narrow and only takes a few people to make it 
unsafe, Pozzi added.

Clooney is currently making the most of his Italian mansion and has been taking his fiancé on a number of romantic dates in the area.

He also flew her mother Baria Alamuddin, 66, out to spend time with them over the weekend in what appears to be their first meeting together.

Clooney and Alamuddin, who is British Lebanese, have been engaged since April following a whirlwind romance when they met at a charity event in September.

She supposedly refused to give her his number so he wooed her with an email which read: ‘The world’s hottest man should meet the hottest human rights lawyer’.
