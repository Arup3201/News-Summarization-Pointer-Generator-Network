Support: Liberal Democrat minister Norman Lamb said he would vote in favour of Lord Falconer's Bill

MPs have expressed support for new legislation on assisted suicide which will be put before Parliament in months - bringing the act a step closer to becoming legal.

The Government is giving MPs a free vote on Lord Falconer's Bill, which would allow doctors to help terminally ill people to die to relieve their suffering.

Under current law, it is illegal to assist someone to take their own life - with a punishment of up to 14 years in jail. 

Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister responsible for care of the elderly and disabled, told the Sunday Telegraph he would vote in favour of the move.

He said the Government 'should not stand in the way' of people who wish to end their life - providing that regulations are put in place.

And Labour MPs Dame Joan Ruddock and Paul Blomfield have also spoken out in support of the legalisation of assisted suicide.

Observers in Parliament predict just over 30 per cent of MPs would back a change in the law, with up to 40 per cent undecided -  while opinion polls have suggested that up to three quarters of the public support assisted suicide.

The new Bill, drawn up by Lord Falconer to legalise 'assisted dying', would enable doctors to prescribe a fatal dose of drugs to people who have less than six months to live.

Case: The Government is giving MPs a free vote on the Bill, which would allow doctors to help terminally ill people to die to relieve their suffering.

Although the patients would take the drugs themselves, doctors would be able to help them if they struggled to swallow the substance.

However, the lethal dose would have to be signed off by two doctors.

The Bill is expected to be put before the House of Lords in the next four months - before being passed to the Commons, if supported.

Advocate: In recent years, author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, has become a vocal advocate of assisted dying being legalised and regulated in the UK

Under the 1961 Suicide Act, those who deliberate assist or encourage others to commit suicide can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison.

However, in 2010, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, issued guidelines making clear that anyone who assists a loved one who has reached a 'settled and informed' decision while 'acting out of compassion' is unlikely to be charged.

The guidelines were the result of a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a terminally ill woman, who in 2008 won a ruling requiring Mr Starmer to set out whether her husband would be convicted for accompanying her to the Swiss Dignitas clinic to die. 

While euthanasia 
is prohibited in Switzerland, the penal code states that assisted 
suicide is legal if no selfish interests are involved.

The issue of assisted suicide is highly controversial - and has been highlighted in recent years by a number of celebrities and high-profile cases.

In August 2012, Tony Nicklinson, a sufferer of 'locked-in' syndrome, was told by a judge he could not choose to end his life with a doctor's help.

Following the trial, Mr Nicklinson, who died just six days later after refusing food, said he had been condemned by the law to ‘a life of increasing indignity and misery.

But Lord Falconer's Bill would not have applied to his situation - with doctors only allowed to help patients with less than six months to live.

It would also not apply to Paul Lamb, a former builder and a father-of-two, who has been almost totally 
paralysed since a car crash in 1990 and wants a doctor to 
help him to die.

Death: Assisted suicide has been further highlighted by ITV's drama Coronation Street, which in January, featured terminally ill character Hayley Cropper ending her own life - although this was not classified as assisted dying. Above, Hayley Cropper and her husband Roy

The Bill, however, would have enabled Diane Pretty, a motor-neurone disease sufferer who took her right-to-die battle to the European Court of Human Rights, to end her own life.

In recent years, author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, has become a vocal advocate of assisted dying being legalised and regulated in the UK - saying: 'I live in hope I can jump before I am pushed.'

 by ITV's drama Coronation Street, which in January, featured terminally
 ill character Hayley Cropper ending her own life - although this was 
not classified as an assisted suicide.

Condemnation: However, David Cameron (left) and Nicky Clegg (right) have spoken out against assisted suicide

Supporters of assisted dying claim a change in the law would allow terminally ill patients to die peacefully and in dignity.

However, doctors, church officials and judges have warned that a legislative change could leave vulnerable people at risk.

In December, one of the country’s most
 distinguished judges claimed allowing the terminally ill to be killed 
would cross ‘a line in the sand’ towards euthanasia.

'Crossing a line': In December, Baroness Butler-Sloss claimed allowing the terminally ill to be killed would cross 'a line in the sand' towards euthanasia. Above, the judge leaves the High Court in London

Baroness Butler-Sloss said: ‘The law rests on the principle that we do not involve ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others.

‘Once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness, that frontier becomes just a line in the sand, easily crossed and hard to defend.'

Prime Minister David Cameron and Liberal Democrat deputy Nicky Clegg have also spoken out against assisted suicide.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'The Government believes that any change to the law in this emotive and contentious area is an issue of individual conscience and a matter for Parliament to decide rather than Government policy.'
