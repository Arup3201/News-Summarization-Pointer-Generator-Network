The biggest soda companies in the country promised to cut the calories Americans get from their drinks by a fifth - but will do it by clever marketing rather than changing the sodas themselves.

The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. today gave a joint pledge to cut the calories consumed via their products by 20 per cent before 2025.

However, the companies' plan won't involve changing what's in their sugary drinks - but by promoting their lower-calorie alternatives, cutting portion sizes and making people more aware of the amount of sugar in regular sodas.

Cut calories: The companies have said they want to reduce the number of calories consumed as a result of their products - but will do so by plugging low-calorie products rather than changing what's in them

The companies - whose full-calorie products are already in decline - made the promise today alongside the rest of the American Beverage Association at a New York summit arranged by the Clinton Foundation and supported by former President Bill Clinton.

They plan to reach their 20 percent goal through
education targeted at communities with less interest in and
access to lower calorie beverages.

They will promote products
like bottled water and introduce and expand their offerings of
zero calorie or lower-calorie products.

Initially, those efforts
will be rolled out in Little Rock, Arkansas and Los Angeles.

Supporter: Former President Bill Clinton described the initiative as 'huge' - and confessed to his own youthful soda habit

The foundation was also linked to a
separate initiative to reduce beverage calories in schools in
2006.

Speaking about the pledge to the New York Times, President Clinton said: 'This is huge - I've heard it could mean a couple of pounds of weight lost each year in some cases.'

He added that he could sympathize with those who drink a lot of soda, because it is a cheap way to keep back hunger.

Alternatives: The soda companies will push lower-calorie versions instead of the standard ones in a bid to boost public health. Pictured above is Coca Cola Life, an alternative soda with 60 per cent fewer calories than regular coke, which is currently on trial

He said: 'When I was in my freshman year in college trying to live on a dollar a day, I drank at least one and sometimes two 16-ounce bottles of Royal Crown Cola a day because they cost 15 cents.'

Now he prefers water and iced tea. 

Susan K. Neely, the president of the American Beverage Association, said the plan will build on earlier success.

She said: 'It'd be hard to sustain the progress that has been made so far without this commitment,'

In 2010, 16 of the biggest U.S. food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, pledged to remove 1 trillion calories from the U.S. marketplace by 2012 and 1.5 trillion by 2015.

The companies are part of the CEO-led Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation formed in 2009 to reduce obesity.

In January, companies in the foundation said they had collectively sold 6.4 trillion fewer calories in the United States in 2012 than in 2007. 

ut an analysis by University of North Carolina researchers, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine last week, showed that total calories from packaged goods sold to households with children by those companies did not change from 2011 to 2012.

Government data show that 34 percent of adults were obese in 2007-2008.
