The five recently released Taliban prisoners currently living in Doha have been afforded many luxuries, it has been revealed.

A DailyBeast reporter attending a conference in the capital Doha made the discovery while trying to track the Taliban Five down. The former Guantanamo Bay detainees were ultimately not found, but much was found out about their quality of life.

The men went from living in a military prison to a gated luxury compound on the outskirts of town after their exchange earlier this month for U.S. Army prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl.

In the time since they have been released, the former terror suspects have had ‘freedom of movement within Qatar,’ the Daily Beast noted, but have been ‘intentionally avoiding contact with the media.’

This is in stark contrast to the locked-down, under supervision at all times speculations that were rampant at the time Bergdahl was released.

They are also living in a mansion in the al-Muaither neighborhood, ‘ loose conglomeration of modest houses and high-end compounds littered with expensive cars,’ the site observed.

Daily Beast reporter Josh Steinberg ended up in the desert-side area after unsuccessfully trying to track the men down through officials and intelligence analysts at the U.S. - Muslim relations conference he was attending.

Hitting mostly dead ends, he eventually was able to find out the terror conspirators have a masseuse a conference-goer had spoken with.

'It didn’t seem to fit with their hard-line stereotypes,' wrote Steinberg.

The masseur could not be tracked down, nor could a senior Obama Administration official who knew exactly where the men were staying.

An Afghan restaurant in the area also denied having delivered any food to them.

An attempt to approach the Taliban representative office in Doha was met with an angry cop and the reporter jumping into a moving car to escape possible arrest.
