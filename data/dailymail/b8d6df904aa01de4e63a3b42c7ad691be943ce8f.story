She faced 20 years of heart-ache, spent £30,000 and even remortgaged her house refusing to give up hope of becoming a mother.

But cradling her new born daughter in her arms, Louise Gilbert said the two decades of grueling IVF treatment, crippling emotional stress and severe financial strain was a price worth paying.

The 39-year-old, from Sandhurst in Berkshire,  was just a teenager when she was told she had already been through the menopause.

In the years to come, she endured the heartbreak of failed IVF treatments, three miscarriages and a divorce.

But she has no regrets and her dream finally became reality two years ago when her daughter Sofia was born.

Mrs Gilbert, a hairdresser, was left 
devastated when she was told by a doctor in 1994 that she was going through the 
menopause at an extremely young age.

She said: 'By 2004 I had been trying to 
get pregnant for 10 years. I'd come off the pill when I was 19 and had 
IVF three times, each time a failure.

'I was completely heartbroken. I felt as if my dream had crumbled around me.

'Holding
 Sofia in my arms for the first time was an unreal experience. I now 
have the perfect family. It's something I never thought I'd have.'

Despite the odds being stacked against her, 
Mrs Gilbert and her first husband, whom she married in 1999 and has 
since divorced, resolved to try IVF, eventually remortgaging their house
 to pay for repeated attempts.

She said: 'I insisted on an ultrasound scan on my womb to see if there were any eggs left in my ovaries.

'The scan confirmed that I'd gone the whole way through the menopause already, and I was no longer producing eggs.

'I'd been on the pill for several years so had no way of knowing when the change had happened. I was desperate for children, but I was told there was no chance of having my own biological child.'

The couple were not eligible for NHS funding - but she vowed to do whatever it took to become a mother.

She appealed for an egg donor by putting an advert in a magazine and in 2001 she started private treatment at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

Despite conceiving twins, both foetuses were sadly lost. A second round,which brought the total cost to that point to more than £8,000, also failed to produce a viable pregnancy.

Mrs Gilbert said: 'I felt cheated because I put myself through so much.

'Finding a donor had been a nerve-wracking experience and I wasn't sure I could do it again.'

The couple then tried an egg-sharing scheme at a fertility clinic in Aldridge in the West Midlands.

She said: 'This time the treatment cost £10,000. We were told even before we started that it was unlikely to work, but we pushed ahead anyway. It was a time of huge disappointment and heartbreak.

'I was constantly worried about money. All my friends were becoming pregnant.'

Mrs Gilbert's first marriage eventually ended in divorce in 2004.

Cracks started to develop in the relationship as the stresses and strains of the ordeal started to take their toll and they eventually agreed to go their separate ways.

'We were arguing all the time. Having IVF really put pressure on our relationship,' she told The Mirror.

'Not having a baby just highlighted our other difficulties. We’d been together since we were kids and at that age we didn’t know any different.

'We were very different people as we grew up that started to show.'

This scan, during the final course of IVF treatment, was the image they had both been waiting for

Newly single, she decided to take the opportunity to focus on her own health and wellbeing, joining a gym and losing more than three stone.

'I changed my social circle and found more friends. I tried enjoying life a bit more,' she said.

After setting up a mobile hairdressing business she met Mark Gilbert, 37, a vehicle mechanic, who was the brother of a client. The pair married in May 2011.

Six months later, they flew to a fertility clinic in Marbella, Spain, where she would receive an egg donation and IVF treatment at a cost of another £10,000.

Mrs Gilbert said: 'I knew the time was right to try for a baby again and Mark felt the same way.

'A client mentioned that someone she worked with had had a baby at the clinic and I was encouraged to hear that the centre had a high success rate.

The years of trying finally paid off for Louise Gilbert when she saw this scan having become pregnant in 2012

'I felt much more relaxed - it was very helpful to be able to get away from the UK and not juggle the demands of treatment with the pressure of work.

'I was extremely nervous. I'd lost pregnancies during treatment before and part of me knew that this round was doomed to failure too.'

The treatment resulted in Mrs Gilbert conceiving twins with her husband, but hopes were tempered when one of the foetuses was lost ten weeks into the pregnancy.

She said: 'I just prayed that the other twin would hang on. I had several sleepless nights. I could feel the baby kicking within me, but part of me still refused to believe we would actually get to the finishing line.'

On July 25, 2012, Mrs Gilbert finally allowed herself to celebrate when given her newborn daughter Sofia to hold in her arms.

The couple plan to save up enough money to return to the clinic in Spain in the hope of producing a brother or sister for Sofia, pictured

She said: 'Mark couldn't stop crying. We were over the moon. Having been through so much over the years, I was simply overjoyed.

'If only I'd known about the Marbella clinic earlier, perhaps I wouldn't have had to live for so long with so much disappointment. Now I want as many people as possible to know about it, because I know there are thousands of other women out there who are in the same position as I was.

'Once we've got the money, I'd like to go back to the clinic to give Sofia a little brother or sister. It would be wonderful to make our family larger.

'But if things stay as they are, I would be perfectly content. Sofia's our miracle child and I'm extremely grateful to finally have her in my life.'
