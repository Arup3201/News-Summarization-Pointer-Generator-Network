Wayne Rooney has revealed that he's 'absolutely devastated' after England's premature World Cup exit.

Roy Hodgson's side have crashed out of the summer tournament after two defeats from two games in Group D.

Rooney took to his official Facebook page to apologise to the English fans.

Upset: Rooney had apologised to England fans via social media earlier in the day

Popular: The England striker's Facebook post has already received over 100,000 'likes'

He wrote: 'Absolutely devastated to be out of the World Cup. Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn't worked out.

'Sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we haven't done better...gutted!'

The comment has already picked up over 100,000 'likes' as the Manchester United striker attempts to ease the discontent amongst England fans. 

Rooney scored England's equalising during the 2-1 defeat against Uruguay on Thursday night, but  received criticism for his poor display against Italy a week earlier.

The 28-year-old played from the left of midfield against the Azzurri and struggled to make an impact on the game despite setting up Daniel Sturridge for his only goal of the tournament so far.

Chance: Rooney's second half goal against Uruguay gave England hope before Luis Suarez scored the winner 

Rooney's United team-mate Robin van Persie has moved to defend the England star and even claimed that he is one of the reasons the Dutchman went to Old Trafford.

Van Persie said: ‘I watched most of the game against Italy and the whole game against Uruguay, and I think it is a shame. England played quite well and were so unlucky.

'Wayne worked his socks off, played very well and could have scored four goals so I don’t think he is to blame.

'Wayne is a great player. As I’ve said many times, Wayne was partly the reason I came to Manchester United.'
