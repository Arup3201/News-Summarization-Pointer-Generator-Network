U.S. President Barack Obama gave a landmark speech at the G20 Summit on Saturday where his call for immediate action to protect the Great Barrier Reef was met with rousing applause.

Conservationists have claimed that the U.S. President's urging should force industrialisation along the Queensland coast to stop immediately.

Mr Obama piled pressure on the Abbott government to act on climate change, declaring that natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef were under direct threat from climate change.

And although Prime Minister Tony Abbott did not mention climate change in his opening address to G20 leaders, it appears the government  may be backing down  on the eve of the main leaders' event.

'It's my understanding ... that they are actively discussing the issue of climate change,' said UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, who expects leaders to make a strong commitment to the problem over the weekend.

'Of course, climate change is the defining issue of our times, therefore it's only natural that G20 leaders should focus much more on this,' he said. 

President Barack Obama received a rock star's welcome at his landmark speech at the University of Queensland

The U.S. President said today that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena.

'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit, he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause.

'I want that there 50 years from now.' 

Despite the official G20 agenda excluding the issue of climate change, President Obama mirrored the concerns raised by protesters outside the venue in South Brisbane, calling for developed nations to join in the 'global fight'.

While the Australian government attempted to keep the focus of the Asia-Pacific leaders summit on economic growth and jobs, Mr Obama steered the focus back to climate change, following the U.S. deal with China to slash emissions. 

The U.S. President also urged younger Australians to put pressure on politicians to take action on the issue and committed $US3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to aid developing nations to assist with initiating economies that were cleaner-fueled.

Japan is also expected to unveil a $US1.5 billion contribution to the fund over the G20 summit weekend.

Civil society groups are urging Australia to make its own contribution.

President Obama's speech to several hundred lucky students was one of the hottest items on the G20 agenda, and he didn't disappoint

US President Barack Obama smiles broadly as he takes the stage to speak at the University of Queensland, telling the audience he heard Queensland was: 'beautiful one day, perfect the next'.

The Australian Marine Conservation Society said the US president had put the reef's future front and centre, and the government must stop paying lip service to serious concerns raised by UNESCO, the UN's environmental arm. 

UNESCO has given Australia until February to show it is properly managing the Barrier Reef, and if the world body is not satisfied with the response, the reef could be listed as a World Heritage site 'in danger'.

Felicity Wishart, spokeswoman for the Marine Conservation Society said that it was time for the Federal and Queensland governments to 'take heed and act decisively.'

She claimed that the government had attempted to 'placate concerns by whitewashing international consternation such as that expressed by UNESCO and the World Heritage committee.'

Ms Wishart said that in order to reverse the trend, 'our governments must stop the rapid industrialisation of the coastline, driven primarily by plans for increased coal mining.'

President Obama also issued a stark warning to Russia over the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 and pleaded for the world to act on climate change.

In a speech where he joked about drinking the popular Queensland beer XXXX, dubbed the G20 host city 'Brisvegas' and said he wanted to give Australian humour 'a burl', the second term president told a crowd of young Australians and political bigwigs that the United States, 'as an ally and friend', shares Australia's grief over the destroyed Malaysian Airlines flight.

President Obama told the audience that Russian aggression was a 'threat' to the world

President Obama also said that he wanted global action on climate change, so maybe his daughter's had the chance to see the Great Barrier Reef 

In a pot shot at Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration, Mr Obama said the United States was 'leading in opposing Russia's aggression, which is a threat to the world - which we saw in the appalling shoot down of MH17'.

Thirty-eight Australians were killed in the incident earlier this year, and tensions have ratcheted up between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the incident, particularly after the prime minister threatened to 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the issue at this weekend's G20 meeting. 

In the address, the president also urged the world to seal a global deal on climate change, 'because I have not had time to visit the Great Barrier Reef,' Mr Obama said, to a roar of laughter. 'And I want to come back!'

The president, who announced a $3 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund, continued: 'And I want my daughters to come back and I want their daughters or sons to visit.'

The president also acknowledged Australia has had a 'healthy debate' about action to stop climate change but he said that if China and the United States could strike a deal on the global threat - as they did earlier this week: 'We can get this done.'

The president, who arrived in Australia this morning and will leave tomorrow evening, bemoaned the fact he never got to see much of the country.

'I've got to sit in conferences and talk to politicians instead of going to the beach,' he said, comments which were met with laughter from the audience, many who had waited for several hours to hear the president's address. 

The president also acknowledged Australia has had a 'healthy debate' about action to stop climate change but he said that if China and the United States could strike a deal on the global threat - as they did earlier this week: 'We can get this done.'

Mr Obama said that his staff 'were very excited to visit Brisvegas' and had recommended he drink the famous Queensland beer, XXXX.

'I learnt to speak a little 'Strayan'. I'm tempted to give it a 'burl',' he quipped, before laughing at his joke. 

'That's about as far I'll go.'

After the address, Australian political bigwigs seemed to transform into political groupies, delighting in receiving a handshake from the president as he left the room.

Political figures who mixed with students and Obama fans included Opposition Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek, veteran federal Liberal MP and Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan and former Governor-General Quentin Bryce.

Students described Obama's speech as 'absolutely phenomenal'

A large crowd awaited US President Barack Obama's address at the University of Queensland

The crowd was already working itself up into a lather prior to Mr Obama's speech, as iconic American songs such as Stevie Wonder's 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered' played over the speakers.

'How could he not inspire you,' said University of Queensland student, Stuart Kinsella, who said he was lucky enough to win tickets to the event through the university. 'He's Barack Obama - what more could I say.'

Several students Daily Mail Australia spoke to following the speech felt the president had delivered with his address.

'Words can't describe it, absolutely phenomenal,' said Sophia Aston, 17, Mount St Michael's college in Ashgrove.

There was certainly an almighty roar as the president finally exited the room, with a wave. 

HE WANTS TO GET OUT HERE MORE

It’s good to be back in Australia. The only problem in Australia is I’ve got to sit in conferences and talk to politicians instead of going to the beach.

A DRINK, ANYONE?

OBAMA: ‘My staff was very excited for ‘Brisvegas’. When I arrived they advised i needed some XXXX.’

(Shouting from the crowd) 

OBAMA: ‘You have some?’

CROCODILE INSURANCE 

‘When I went out to Darwin to inaugurate the new rotation of the U.S. marines there, the mayor - I think it was the mayor - took out crocodile insurance... which disturbed me.

HIS AMBASSADOR EXPLAINS CROCODILE INSURANCE

‘He described to me how crocodiles kill a lot more people than sharks. And that there’s a lot of things in Australia that can kill you.’

HIS TRIP HERE AS A LITTLE BOY:

‘I learnt to speak a little Strayan. I’m tempted to give it a burl.

'Hah. That’s about as far as I can go.'
