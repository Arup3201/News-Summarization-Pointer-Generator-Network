Prince Charles was last night accused of paying a lower tax rate than his servants.

Labour MP Austin Mitchell claimed the Prince of Wales was ‘dodging around’ to avoid tax.

He said that by refusing to classify the Duchy of Cornwall property empire as a corporation, Charles did not pay corporation tax like other big profit-making firms.

Tax: MPs questioned the tax affairs of the Prince of Wales, who visited Bude in Cornwall today with Camilla

Income: Last year the Duchy of Cornwall made £19million in profits for Prince Charles, who met 16-month old Jasmine Marsh and her mum Jessica Marsh, 34, during his annual visit to Cornwall 

Mr Mitchell also criticised him for paying too little income tax on the £19million he received from the duchy last year year.

He demanded to know why Charles paid 
just 23.6 per cent of his income in direct and indirect tax, compared 
with an average of 38 per cent paid by the poorest quarter of the 
population.

Describing the Duchy of Cornwall, 
which owns land across the South West and provides Charles with his 
income as heir to the throne, as a ‘medieval anomaly’, Mr Mitchell 
suggested the only reason it was not registered as a company was so the 
Prince could avoid tax.

The criticism came as Charles’s 
principal private secretary, William Nye, appeared before MPs on the 
Commons spending watchdog, the public accounts committee.

Chairman Margaret Hodge, who led the 
fight against tax-dodging corporations Starbucks and Google, said it was
 ‘shockingly wrong’ that the Prince was paying so little tax on the 
duchy’s profits.

Committee member Mr Mitchell said: ‘It
 looks to me that Prince Charles pays a smaller proportion in tax than 
any of his domestic servants.’ Mr Nye insisted that Charles actually 
paid the top rate of income tax, but because he counts the cost of his 
official duties as a business expense against his tax bill, he appears 
to pay less as a proportion of his gross income.

Mr Nye said he could do this because ‘his business is being the Prince of Wales’.

The MPs also criticised Prince Charles for:

Choppy waters: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also met local surfers in Bude

Grilling: Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge raised questions about the prince's tax affairs with William Nye, Principal Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall

The Duchy of Cornwall, set up in 1337, enables the heir to the throne to have a separate income from the monarch.

This means he does not have to pay corporation tax. However, he does pay income tax.

His tax bill during the last financial year was £4.4million, less than a quarter of his £19million income.

Quoting from the Duchy’s annual 
report, Mr Mitchell said: ‘Prince Charles’s direct tax plus indirect tax
 is 24 per cent of his income for 2012 and 23.6 per cent for 2013. The 
bottom quartile of households pay direct and indirect taxes as a 
percentage of income of 38 per cent and the top quartile pay 33.7 per 
cent.’

Questions: The Public Accounts Committee called senior aides to the Prince to explain his tax affairs

Mr Nye said the amount of tax Charles 
paid was so low because of the high level of his ‘official expenditure’ 
racked up when he represents the Queen. This is set against his tax 
bill.

He added: ‘The Prince of Wales paid 
last year at 50 per cent, this year at 45 per cent. He pays income tax 
on his income after relevant business expenses.

That is what is laid 
out... by the Government. It’s been that way since the Prince of Wales 
and the Queen first started paying income tax 20 years ago, so his 
official expenditure, which he chooses to use his private income to 
meet, is the equivalent of business expenses for someone else who has a 
business.

‘Those costs are before tax and he pays income tax on the amount after those official expenses.

‘So if you just take the income before
 the official expenses and divide by the tax you will get the figures 
you were giving but that doesn’t give the whole story.’ Mr Mitchell said
 of the duchy: ‘You are really dodging around because for tax purposes 
it’s not a corporation but for every other purpose it is a corporation.’

Mr Nye replied: ‘I don’t think it’s a corporation in the way in which you say.

‘The Duke of Cornwall owns an estate. But... Parliament hasn’t set it up as a company or a corporation.

‘It’s a private estate and it’s run as a private estate.’

The world’s press has been camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in London for a fortnight, and social media is continually awash with rumours that the Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour.

But yesterday the Duchess of Cornwall dropped a tantalising hint that the wait could soon be over, telling well-wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive by the ‘end of the week’.

Camilla let slip the secret during a visit to a children’s hospice near St Austell in Cornwall. 

As she gave an impromptu speech to the assembled guests, she said: ‘We are all just waiting by the telephone. 

‘We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be here.’ A Clarence House spokesman later confirmed the comment.  William and Kate’s private office at Kensington Palace has refused to confirm the duchess’s exact due date, although Kate herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this year that it is ‘mid July’.

Sources have told the Daily Mail that her due date was in fact yesterday.

It is understood that William now has a few days off from his job as an RAF Search and  Rescue pilot in North Wales, which he will spend with his wife at their Kensington Palace residence. Kate stayed at her parents’ house in Berkshire this weekend, while William played in two long-standing charity polo matches.
