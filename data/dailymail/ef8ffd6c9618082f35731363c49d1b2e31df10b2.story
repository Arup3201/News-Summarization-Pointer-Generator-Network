Real Madrid are considering whether to bid for Radamel Falcao at the end of the season with the Colombian striker unlikely to stay at Manchester United after his disappointing loan spell at the club.

But Monaco, Falcao's owners, say that they have no concerns regarding Falcao’s future as there are plenty of major teams who have contacted them to take the 29-year-old striker.

Falcao has scored just four goals and had just 14 starts for United since joining in loan on transfer deadline day – and United are not expected to take up their £43m option.

But Monaco vice president Vadim Vasilyev said: ‘It’s up to Manchester United to take a decision but I’m not worried for him because we have interest from other big clubs.

'Sometimes it’s just little thing that matter in football. When the technical quality is there, the mentality is there, sometimes it’s just the confidence of the coach or just little details. We tend to overreact if somebody doesn’t do well for a few years.

‘Had he stayed here – I know he wanted a bigger challenger and Man United is a great club – one of our problems is efficiency in front of goal. If he was here we would not be fourth, we would be first or second.’

Louis van Gaal is unlikely to make the forward's deal permanent and Real Madrid are potentially interested

Falcao will be available if United do not take up their option. His agent is Jorge Mendes, who has a good relationship with Real Madrid and the Spanish giants considered buying Falcao last summer.

The forward was named on the bench for United's 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Saturday but was not called upon by manager Louis van Gaal.
