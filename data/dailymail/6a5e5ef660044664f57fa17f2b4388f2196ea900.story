Miroslav Balog, 32, from Shoebury, Essex, was let off most of his outstanding fines despite a string of shoplifting offences

Having only one arm didn’t hold back Miroslav Balog in his chosen profession – shoplifting.

In fact, he accumulated more than £900 in fines by stealing from seafront traders  in Essex.

So understandably, local business owners were outraged when the serial thief, 32, was let off paying almost £860 of it – on the condition that he spent the day on court premises.

Instead of a more traditional punishment, Balog was simply forced to stay until 5pm at Southend Magistrates’ Court, where he was free to wander around the concourse and eat in the cafeteria.

Paul Thompson, chairman of Southend Seafront Traders’ Association, said: ‘That is not a deterrent. It is carte blanche for him to carry on offending.

‘Serial offenders are given a soft touch approach and ordinary hard-working people lose out because these criminals are getting off scot-free. It’s ridiculous.

‘These people waste police time. Police do their job, but unfortunately the courts put the offenders back on the street.

‘What will happen if he’s in there again? Will we start giving him money?’

Balog, a Czech heroin addict with no left arm, appeared in court this week to admit his latest crimes – stealing £178 worth of meat from the Co-op in Southend between February and April. He was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and initially told to pay £87 in compensation.

But when magistrates heard that he still owed £904 for previous offences, they decided to ‘give him another opportunity to turn his life around’ by waiving nearly all of his outstanding fines.

Chairman of the bench Robert Smale said he would write off £859 of the unpaid charges if Balog agreed to stay on court grounds until 5pm.

The defendant was given the chance by 
magistrates to spend the rest of the day on the grounds of Southend 
Magistrates' Court, in return for an £859 outstanding fine being waived

Balog agreed, and will now only have 
to pay £87.66 compensation for the meat thefts, as well as £45 for one 
of his previous offences.

The
 court heard the unemployed father of three, of Shoebury, Essex, feared 
he would be deported to the Czech Republic if he continued to commit 
crimes. He claimed to be working hard to change his life and had asked 
to serve time in prison last year to try to come off drugs, the 
magistrates were told.

Michelle
 Breindel, mitigating, said Balog had promised to turn over a new leaf, 
 adding: ‘I said to him, “You have no money, will you go and shoplift to
 support your family?” He said, “No, we will have to manage with what we
 have.”’

Mr Smale told 
Balog: ‘We have heard you are turning your life around. You have another
 opportunity to do so – make sure you take it.’

A
 spokesman for the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary said: ‘We do not 
comment on judges’ and magistrates’ sentencing decisions, other than to 
say they sentence on the facts of each case and within guidelines.’
