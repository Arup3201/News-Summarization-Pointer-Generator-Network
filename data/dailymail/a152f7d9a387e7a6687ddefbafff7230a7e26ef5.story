One ancient little girl: The skull of Selam, whose remains have now revealed that human ancestors remained tree-climbers for longer than thought

Analysis of the bones of a girl who died 3.3million years ago in East Africa suggests our ancestors came down from the trees later than many scientists thought.

The fossilised shoulder blades of Selam, a three-year-old unearthed in Dikika, Ethiopia, show features that suggest she and her family were able climbers - despite also being adapted for walking on the ground.

Selam is a remarkably well-preserved example of Australopithecus afarensis, thought to be an important forerunner of modern human beings. She is the same species as Lucy, the famous 3.2million-year-old skeleton discovered in 1974.

Although A. afarensis was an upright walking species, the question of whether it also spent much of its time in trees has been hotly debated, partly because a complete set of shoulder blades has never before been available for investigation.

Lead researcher Professor David Green, from Midwestern University, Illinois, said: 'These remarkable fossils provide strong evidence that these individuals were still climbing at this stage in human evolution.'

It took 11 years to painstakingly extract the paper-thin shoulder blades from the rest of Selam's skeleton, which was encased in sandstone in 2000 by Zeresenay Alemseged, a co-author of the study published in Science.

Dr Alemseged, Curator of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences, said finding shoulder blades intact and attached to a skeleton was 'like hitting the jackpot'.

'Because shoulder blades are paper-thin, they rarely fossilise - and when they do, they are almost always fragmentary,' he said.

'This study moves us a step closer toward answering the question "When did our ancestors abandon climbing behaviour?",' he added.

'It appears that this happened much later than many researchers had previously suggested.'

Selam was a three-year-old A. afarensis girl whose skeleton is the most complete of her kind yet discovered.

After freeing her shoulder blades from the surrounding rock, the researchers digitised then and took detailed measurements which they compared with other early human relatives as well as modern great apes and humans.

Analysis of the shape and function of the bones revealed a partially tree-living lifestyle. At the same time, the hip, lower leg and foot were human-like and adapted for upright walking.

'Human scapulae change shape throughout ontogeny in a significantly different manner than closely related apes," said Dr Green.

'When we compared Selam's scapula with adult members of Australopithecus afarensis, it was clear that the pattern of growth was more consistent with that of apes than humans.'

Dr Alemseged added: 'This new find confirms the pivotal place that Lucy and Selam's species occupies in human evolution.

'While bipedal like humans, A. afarensis was still a capable climber. Though not fully human, A. afarensis was clearly on its way.'
