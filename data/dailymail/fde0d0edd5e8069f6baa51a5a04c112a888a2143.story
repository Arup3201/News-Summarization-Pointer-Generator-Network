A 32-year-old mother of five was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent just yards from her home in suburban San Diego on Friday, after she ran him over.

The agent fired after being driven several hundred yards on the hood of Valeria Alvarado's car.

Her husband, Gilbert Alvarado, is 
furious about what happened and believes the agent who shot her overreacted.

'My wife got killed for no reason,' 
Gilbert told NBC 7. Show me that my wife had a gun or 
something that threatened the guyâ€™s life where he had to use lethal 
force against her.'

The shooting occurred about five miles 
north of the Mexican border as plainclothes agents were looking to serve
a felony warrant in the area to someone other than Alvarado, Border 
Patrol Deputy Chief Rodney Scott told U-T San Diego.

'Fearing for his life, he discharged his weapon to get the vehicle to stop,' Scott said. No other agents fired.

Officials allege that Alvarado 
intentionally tried to run over the agent, but her family say it was an accident.

Alvarado was declared dead at the scene, and the agent was taken to a hospital. His injuries were not clear.

Alvarado was a housewife and mother of five children ranging from ages 3 to 17, who went by the name Monique.

Her family said the warrant 
had nothing to do with her and she would never 
intentionally hurt anyone for any reason.

Justice: The victim's husband Gilbert Alvarado says he wants justice for his wife

'I love her to the fullest,' said her husband. 'Where's the evidence my wife 
threatened a trained officer? I want justice.'

Hector Salazar, one of several neighbors who witnessed the incident, said he saw a man in civilian clothes on the hood of a black car aiming a gun at the windshield.

Salazar told U-T San Diego the man started pulling the trigger, and he heard about five shots. Moments later, other plainclothes agents approached the car, he said.

The person named in the warrant the agents were serving was not apprehended, Scott said.

The FBI and Chula Vista police are investigating. The name of the agent involved in the deadly shooting has not yet been released.
