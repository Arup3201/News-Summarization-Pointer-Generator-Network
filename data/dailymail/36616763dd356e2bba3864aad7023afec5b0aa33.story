Czech Republic snatched a last-gasp win over Holland thanks to Vaclav Pilar's added time goal after a dreadful mistake by Daryl Janmaat in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday.

Defender Janmaat attempted to cushion a header back to Jasper Cillessen inside the area but it beat the Dutch keeper and struck the post only for Pilar to tuck the rebound into the net to the delight of the home fans watching the Group A clash.

The Czechs had started brightly and were rewarded in the 22nd minute when David Lafata controlled a cross into the box before laying it off to Borek Dockal whose left-foot shot slammed off the post into the net to give the hosts the lead.

Holland, third-place finishers at the World Cup in Brazil, responded with a Stefan de Vrij driving a header into the back of the net after a cross from Daley Blind in the 55th minute.

The hosts kept their shape at the start in an effort to blunt a Dutch attack missing several key players, including Arjen Robben who was out with an ankle injury.

The Dutch began taking more control in the second half but they could not beat Czech keeper Petr Cech for a winner as both sides pressed forward.

Pavel Vrba’s always looked dangerous on the break though and scored when the Dutch mix up gave them a dream start to their campaign.

The result also gave coach Vrba, who took over following their failure to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil, his first victory at the helm.

The match was Guus Hiddink's first competitive game in charge since his return to the national side after Louis van Gaal stepped down to take charge of Manchester United.

It made Hiddink the first Dutch national manager to lose his first two games since his previous reign in 1995.
