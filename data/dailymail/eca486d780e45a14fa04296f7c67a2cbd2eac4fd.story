The environmental group Greenpeace has not given Peru the names of the activists accused of damaging the world-renowned Nazca lines  during a publicity stunt, Peruvian officials claim.

The government has threatened extradition for the activists involved and said it would seek charges for 'attacking archaeological monuments' - a crime punishable by up to six years in prison.

During a protest at the U.N. World Heritage site in Peru's coastal desert, activists laid a message promoting clean energy beside the famed figure of a hummingbird comprised of black rocks on a white background.

The Greenpeace stunt (pictured) backfired, with Peruvian officials now saying they may seek charges and extradition against those involved for 'attacking archeological monuments'

The message was directed at delegates at the U.N. climate talks being held in nearby Lima. 

Culture Minister Diana Alvarez-Calderon said Monday that Peru 'hasn't obtained what it would have liked to obtain: names, passports, addresses' of the activists involved.

He added: 'What Greenpeace's representative says is that they want to conduct an investigation that will last about a month because they are going to look into 27 affiliates. They want to know who produced the idea for the event, who organized it and who went to it.'

Attempts to reach Greenpeace for comment were not successful, but the organisation has previously apologised for the stunt and said it was willing to accept the consequences.

The activists entered a 'strictly prohibited' area where they laid big yellow cloth letters reading: 'Time for Change; The Future is Renewable.'

They said after initial criticism that they were 'absolutely careful' not to disturb anything.

Greenpeace spokesman Mike Townsley said the organisation was conducting an internal review, the New York Times reported.

He said: 'Everyone who was involved will be approached and asked to account for their role. Until we have carried out a proper investigation we cannot comment on any individuals.'

Peruvian officials say that no one, not even presidents and cabinet ministers, is allowed without authorisation where the activists trod, and those who do have permission must wear special shoes.

The Nazca lines are huge figures depicting living creatures, stylized plants and imaginary figures scratched on the surface of the ground between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. They are believed to have had ritual astronomical functions.

Activists work on the message, which was laid out next to an ancient geoglyph in Nazca, Peru

Greenpeace has since apologised for the stunt and said it was deeply concerned about any 'moral offence'

Activists walk towards the site in Peru. The message was left on a protected UNESCO world heritage site

The message, on a protected UNESCO world heritage site,
aimed to pressure negotiators at a United Nations climate change
summit in Lima that ended on Sunday.

But the stunt backfired - angering not just Greenpeace's
usual detractors but also archaeologists, environmentalists and
a broad cross-section of Peruvians.

The Nazca Lines are striking reminders of Peru's rich
pre-Hispanic past and inspired the Andean country's logo.

Last week a Peruvian judge rejected prosecutors' request to
keep the activists in the country to face questioning, citing
incomplete information.

But Alvarez-Calderon said authorities will keep trying to
hold accountable the dozen activists involved in the action.

'The damage caused is irreparable,' Alvarez-Calderon said at
a news conference. 'We have to continue the process when a
person is not in Peru - extradition if the judge decides so or
civil reparation.'

The geoglyph designs at the site include this huge outline of a bird, known as The Condor

Pictured from the air is another of the geoglyphs at the expansive desert - it is called The Astronaut

Greenpeace apologized for the stunt last week and said it
would take responsibility for the consequences of its actions.

Activists from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Germany,
Italy and Austria took part.

'They created a line that wasn't there before,' said Deputy
Culture Minister Luis Jaime Castillo.

The ancient Nazcan culture created the lines by scraping
away the desert's dark iron-oxide pebbles to uncover white soil
beneath, which hardened as limestone melded with morning dew.

No one knows for sure why the forms were draw, so large, and
for so long - over a period of a thousand years - making them
one of the world's archaeological enigmas.
