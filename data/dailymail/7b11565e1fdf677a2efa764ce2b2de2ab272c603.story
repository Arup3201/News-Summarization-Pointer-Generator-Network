Jose Mourinho has been gagged again by Chelsea after Diego Costa was charged by the FA with violent conduct.

Mourinho is furious with the FA and believes his leading goalscorer is being made a scapegoat following his stamp on Liverpool defender Emre Can.

The Chelsea manager, who took a vow of silence after he was charged by the FA for his 'campaign' claim, was due to speak on Friday ahead of Saturday's clash with Manchester City.

Instead the club have cancelled the scheduled press conference and will not even send in assistant Steve Holland to speak with the media.

Costa has confirmed that he denies the violent conduct charge ahead of tomorrow's FA disciplinary commission hearing.

Despite his protests of innocence, the Chelsea forward is expected to be banned for three games starting with Saturday's clash with City.

Chelsea fear a timing issue on Friday with Mourinho scheduled to speak before the FA deliver their verdict and they did not want to affect the outcome. Mourinho is ready to blow over the decision to charge him but the club fear that yet another outburst will affect the commission findings. 

Diego Costa took part in full training on Thursday but Cesc Fabregas was a notably absentee for the Blues 

Costa showed his dark side on Tuesday with this stamp on Martin Skrtel, for which he was not sent off
