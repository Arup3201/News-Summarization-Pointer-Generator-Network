Marion Bartoli's first match back on British grass since winning Wimbledon ended in retirement and defeat to a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Surrey.

It could not have been more different from the day almost a year ago when she stood on Centre Court holding the Venus Rosewater Dish having achieved her life's dream.

The Frenchwoman retired a month later but accepted an invitation to play in the exhibition Liverpool Hope University International Tennis Tournament at Liverpool Cricket Club.

A dream come true: British teenage Jodie Burrage celebrates as she beats the Wimbledon champion

Her first opponent was teenager Jodie Burrage, and it quickly became clear when Bartoli said she had not played much tennis, she really meant it.

The 29-year-old had been cautious about her hopes beforehand, saying: 'Now I can kind of accept to miss a tennis ball.

'I just still love to play. My body couldn't take the amount of training and what I still had to do to be a professional tennis player, but to be a recreational tennis player is something I can probably do still.

'If she beats me that's fine. It's not like I need to win any more.'

Bartoli was virtually unrecognisable from the player who did not drop a set at Wimbledon last year and the disbelief on Burrage's face was clear as she raced into a 4-0 lead.

Bartoli won the next four games but could not save the set, and trailing 7-5, 3-2 she pulled out with a right shoulder problem.

Burrage was left to celebrate the most unlikely of wins, saying: 'I can't believe it. It's amazing to be able to say that, and even to be able to play against her. So to win, it's unreal.

'I was really nervous, I was thinking, 'Just get a couple of games', or even a game. Then when I was out on the court, I couldn't believe the scoreline and how I was playing. I played really well.

'When I won the first game, I thought it was lucky. When I went 4-0 up, I was like, 'Oh my God, you could get a set'. I didn't think I'd win. Then I think I lost my focus a bit but I still managed to get that and then go up in the second.

'Unfortunately she had to pull out, but still it was incredible. When I told my friends from tennis I was playing her, they were telling me I should be really excited not nervous. They're going to be really happy for me.'

Burrage, 208th in the junior world rankings, earned the chance to play in the event by winning a junior tournament in Liverpool last year.

That gave her a pass into qualifying, which she came through on Sunday, but her first opponent came as a big shock.

'I don't think we knew Bartoli was playing but then after I won qualifying I was told, "You're playing Bartoli on Thursday",' Burrage said. 'I just said, "What? Excuse me?".

'I've just played girls round my age before, I haven't played any professionals like her. This is a one-time experience.'

Bartoli is expected to compete in doubles on Friday, although it was unclear whether she would be able to complete her round-robin singles matches.
