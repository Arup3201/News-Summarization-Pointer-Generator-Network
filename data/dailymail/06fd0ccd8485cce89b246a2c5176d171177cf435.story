The dramatic moment a car flew past a red light and ended up smashing into another traffic light pole has been captured by a driver's dashboard camera.

A small black car appears to come flying through the lights at a junction in Townsville, Queensland, and smashes into an oncoming black car in the footage filmed on Saturday.

The unsuspecting car's bumper shatters across the street as the runaway vehicle continues and collides into a pole.

As the driver filming the incident with a dashboard camera reverses it becomes clear the small back car, driven by a 23-year-old woman, has completely flipped and landed on its roof.

A witness is seen running on to the scene to help from the right side of the street.

Another man runs out the pub on the left corner of the junction with a beer still in his hand to try and assist.

Astonishingly the driver and other people involved only suffered cuts and bruises.

A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia 'at this stage the incident is still under investigation'.

The smash reportedly caused traffic chaos for commuters in Townsville, according to Nine News.

Two women aged 22 and 23 were taken to Townsville Hospital and a third woman also suffered minor injuries.
