Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud admits he needs to stop being so emotional on the pitch and prove he has a 'killer' attitude - similar to Chelsea striker Diego Costa.

The Frenchman is in fine form at present, netting eight goals in his last 11 games, but still divides opinion in the stands and in the public eye.

Part of the reasoning behind that is his mentality on the pitch, often throwing his hands up in the air and letting the occasion get the best of him after missing an opportunity. He says Costa is the perfect role model in that respect.

Olivier Giroud admits he needs to stop letting his emotion getting the best of him at Arsenal

Giroud says Diego Costa shows no emotion on the pitch and he should follow his lead in the Premier League

'When I do this (he puts his head in his hands) after a missed chances, the coaches get a bit annoyed,' the former Montpellier striker told L'Equipe.

'They want me to have a 'killer' attitude, almost insensitive. Diego Costa shows no emotion. I am more emotional. I have therefore learned to control my emotions. I try to be less demonstrative.

Despite Giroud's impressive form since signing for the Gunners in 2012 and Danny Welbeck's arrival in the summer, Arsenal have been consistently linked with other strikers.

Most recently a move for Porto's Jackson Martinez has been mooted, with the player admitting he would like a move to the Emirates Stadium, while Arsene Wenger has been praising the Colombian star.

Giroud says such talk simply motivates him to score more goals.

When you talk about a guy to play in your place, you feel offended because it is your place,' he said. 'I here them saying: 'They have Giroud and Welbeck but they need a world-class attacker'. It is like saying, we are not world-class attackers.

Giroud has been in fine form in recent weeks and has scored 8 goals in his last 11 games

Jackson Martinez has been linked in recent weeks and Giroud says the rumours drive him on

'Does it upset me? No but it stings. Recently there was a buzz around Jackson Martinez (Porto). The coach said nice things about him, the player said he would like to come.

'I heard that just before the Middlesbrough game. It gave me extra motivation. I was very pleased to score two goals.'

Giroud will hope to be on the scoresheet again when Arsenal play Monaco in the Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday night.
