Jeremy Clarkson is still unrepentant for sparking a series of race rows, the BBC’s television chief has revealed.

The Top Gear presenter still ‘doesn’t see the problem’ with using words like ‘n*****’ and ‘slope’ despite causing widespread outrage, TV controller Danny Cohen said.

Mr Cohen said he personally found Clarkson’s behaviour ‘entirely unacceptable’ and warned the star that ‘no one show or person is bigger than the BBC.’

Jeremy Clarkson is still unrepentant for sparking a series of race rows, the BBC's television chief has revealed. It comes after he was filmed using the 'n' word during an episode of Top Gear

But he declined to confirm that Clarkson would be fired if he made further controversial remarks.

Mr Cohen ordered an internal investigation into the hit show after a string of controversies saw it criticised by communications watchdog Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules over a 'racial' term used by Clarkson.

The regulator decided the comment, made by the star during the programme’s Burma special screened in March, was offensive.

Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, he said: ‘I was very, very clear in public and in private with Jeremy that I was incredibly unhappy with his language.

‘I made that really clear, Jeremy knows that that’s my position and that that’s going to impact on the way the show is thought about in future.

‘People have different views on Jeremy Clarkson. Obviously loads of people think that me being so angry about it is an overreaction.  I have heard lots of people say that. I don’t think it was an overreaction.

‘He disagrees too, by the way. He doesn’t see the problem with some of the language he used. I do. I think it was unacceptable, I’ve made that really clear to him, and we’ll go from there.’

Clarkson, 54, escaped the sack in May despite being forced to issue a grovelling apology for apparently using the word ‘n*****’ during a Top gear outtake.

Unused footage from Top Gear emerged showing the £1million a year host swinging his finger between two cars while reciting a notoriously racist children’s nursery rhyme.

In the clip, he could be heard chanting: ‘Eeny, meeny, miny, moe’ before apparently mumbling ‘Catch a n***** by his toe’.

Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was ‘mortified’ by the upset he had caused, and ‘begged forgiveness’ of his fans.

It came after he sparked outrage by making a racist joke during another episode of the hit motoring show, screened in March.

While filming in Burma, he joked a bridge with an Asian man walking across it had a ‘slope on it’.

Mr Cohen said he was ‘very, very unhappy’ with Clarkson’s language on both occasions.

Asked why the presenter had not been sacked for his behaviour, the TV controller said: ‘I think it is like football clubs, no one is bigger than the club. That’s why I was so clear in public and in private that I was unhappy with it and wouldn’t accept it.

‘No one show or person is bigger than the BBC, and that includes me and anyone who works there.’

Mr Cohen was pressed on whether Clarkson would be fired if he is involved in another similar gaffe, but failed to answer the question directly.

Instead, he replied: ‘As I said, he feels differently about it to me but I think it is very important when a member of the team, including on-screen talent, has done something unacceptable, you tell them.’
