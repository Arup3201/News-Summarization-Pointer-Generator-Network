It was supposed to be dream move - returning home to their native California.

But a couple has been left distraught after a removal van containing their entire possessions was stolen on the eve of their relocation.

Jason Jones and Ambrose Romero had packed the contents of their condo in Capitol Hill, Seattle, into the 24-feet van, leaving it outside the property overnight.

Taken: The removal van was parked outside their property overnight on the eve of their move

When they woke on Sunday morning the van, containing artworks, family mementos and a valuable memorabilia collection, had vanished.

Police tracked down the vehicle in Renton two days later but the thieves only left a couple of blankets and a picture frame.

'We didn’t really expect anyone to steal a giant diesel truck in the middle of a downtown street,' said  Mr Jones, who has lived with his husband for seven years.

The van is thought to have been stolen 5:30am and 8am.

Mr Jones described the theft as 'heartbreaking', adding 'our whole lives were in there'.

He said that the couple would watch auction websites such as eBay to check whether any of their possessions appear for sale online.

Gone: The condo, where the couple had lived for seven years, contained artwork, furniture and mementos that were all stored in the stolen van

Valuable: The van also contained Mr Jones's collection of movie memorabilia and thousands of action figures, worth $15,000

Not covered: The couple had no insurance on their possessions and only minimal insurance on the van

The van included Mr Jones's collection of movie 
memorabilia and thousands of action 
figures - worth an estimated $15,000.

But the couple's problems have been compounded by the fact that they their possessions were uninsured, while they only had minimal insurance on the van.

Mr Romero said: 'It feels like we’re in a dream, a 
nightmare right now and at some point we are going to wake up from this 
and this is going to be in our past, but the reality of it is our stuff 
for the past seven years is gone.'

He told Q13Fox: 'It’s those mementos that we have from 
family members, that have a past, friends that in the past that have 
given us something over the years that I’ll think about it and I’ll 
think I’m not going to see that picture again or that mug again, that’s 
no longer with us, and it’s rough, it’s hard.'

Broken: The couple talked of their devastation and 'heartbreak'

Scene: The van was taken between 5:30am and 8am from the street outside the couple's home in Seattle
