CCTV: Nile Ranger has allegedly been caught on CTTV attacking a woman. He is pictured outside court last year, where he was cleared of a rape charge

Former Premiership footballer Nile Ranger is to be questioned by police after he was allegedly caught on camera slapping and punching a woman outside his block of flats.

CCTV footage has emerged purportedly showing the former Newcastle striker, 23 - who now plays for Swindon Town - breaking into his own apartment block two weeks ago.

The video shows a figure - believed to be Ranger - striking an unknown young woman who appears to confront him while he struggles to access the building in Swindon, Wiltshire.

He slaps the woman twice with his right hand, then punches her with his left, knocking her against the wall.

The man is then launches a running kick at the door to the apartment block, which allows him to break through, footage acquired by the Sunday Mirror shows.

Wiltshire Police have now said they are seeking the 23-year-old player in connection with assault and also criminal damage to the door, glass paneling and the wall it was attached to, said to amount to around Â£2,000.

The incident is thought to have taken place on April 13 at around 4am. An unnamed source speculated that Ranger may have forgotten a key fob which would have let him through the door.

The incident came weeks after the footballer was cleared of a rape charge at Newcastle Crown Court. Ranger was acquitted by a jury of raping a woman in a hotel room after a night out.

Wilteshire Police confirmed that a 23-year-old man would be 'contacted via his solicitor for interview by appointment'.

A spokesman said: 'Police were contacted on April 23 by a building management company to report criminal damage at a residential address in Gordon Gardens, Swindon'.

'The company were visiting to assess damage reported by residents to have happened on April 13 at approximately 4am.
