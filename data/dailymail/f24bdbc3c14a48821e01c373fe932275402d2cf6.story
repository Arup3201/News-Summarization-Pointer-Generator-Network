A young volunteer who dedicated her life to helping African children has died in a Kenyan plane crash alongside her mother.

The bodies of Bess Rosenzweig, 22, and her mother Clare Clube were found in mountain ranges after their plane to Nairobi crashed in Aberdare National Park on July 25.

The Georgetown University graduate reportedly volunteered as a teacher outside Nairobi,
 and had planned to settle there after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in 
neighbouring Tanzania, and becoming friendly with locals.

Heartbreak: The cause of the fatal plane crash in Kenya has yet to be determined

Dedicated: The young volunteer had intended to stay on in Kenya before she died in the crash

Miss Rosenzweig had been close to the end of a two week holiday in Kenya with her mother when their plane crashed

The mother and daughter's bodies, and that of their pilot, were found three days later after a search and rescue effort, Boston.com reports.

The cause of the crash is not yet known.

Friends
 and family  told the paper they remembered the graduate, who spoke 
Swahili, for her humanitarian drive, sense of adventure, and friendly 
demeanor.

Her father David Rosenzweig said she loved animals and was passionate about protecting African wildlife.

'When she found something she was passionate about, she invested in it wholly, and devoted all her efforts toward it,' he said.

Miss Rosenzweig was planning to Cape 
Town, South Africa, to work at the Lalela Project, which provides art 
education, after graduating in spring.

A college friend, Amy Lewis, told the
 paper she had travelled to Kenya with Miss Rosenzweig and could 'tell 
she was meant to be there'. She added: 'Here was this tiny, 
blond-haired, blue-eyed girl who could speak Swahili, and everyone there
 just loved her.'

Ms Clube,
 48, was born in Wiltshire, and was said to have been also very drawn to
 Kenya and was sponsoring an African child to pay for education. 

Family
 described the freelance artist as a warm and generous free spirit. She 
divided her time after her divorce from Miss Rosenzweig's father between
 Virgin, Utah, London  and Glen Etive, 
Scotland.

Her son and Miss Rosenzweig's brother Jake, described his mother as 'loving, supportive, and eccentric'.
