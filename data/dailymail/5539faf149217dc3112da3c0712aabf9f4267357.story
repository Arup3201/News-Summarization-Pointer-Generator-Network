Move over Mario Balotelli. The Premier League has a new bad boy. Eljero Elia completed a loan move to Southampton from Werder Bremen on Tuesday, but in Germany they are simply glad to see the back of him.

Despite his obvious talent, the Dutch winger has disappointed in his two spells as a Bundesliga player. Like Liverpool's controversial frontman Balotelli, Elia is more accustomed to grabbing headlines for his misdemeanours off the pitch, rather than his achievements on it.

The winger first came to the Bundesliga when he joined Hamburg in 2009. After two years of failing to live up to expectations, the Dutchman left the club in 2011 under a cloud of controversy.

Southampton have confirmed the loan signing of Werder Bremen winger Eljero Elia

The former Hamburg midfielder has made 28 appearances for Holland  

2011 - Before his move to Juventus, Elia was fined by Hamburg for complaining that the club hadn't looked after him following an ankle operation.

2013 - Caught speeding at 3am alongside now Stoke midfielder Marko Arnautovic. It was alleged that the pair had insulted and acted agressivley towards the police officer.

2014 - Tweets 'Ready for War' ahead of Werder Bremen vs Hamburg clash before insulting a fan of his own team via Facebook.

He complained that the team's style didn't suit him, and that the club had not looked after him during an ankle operation. Hamburg fined him for his complaints, and Elia stormed off to Juventus.

One disappointing year later, he was back in the north of Germany, signing for Hamburg's arch rivals Werder Bremen. The club shelled out £4.5m for the player and put him on a £2m salary. Elia was billed as “the man who will shoot Bremen back into Europe”.

Instead, the club have spent two and a half seasons loitering around the relegation zone, and Elia has shown the worst side of his character in a host of off the field scandals.

In April 2013, the Dutchman was caught speeding at 3am alongside then team-mate Marko Arnautovic. It was later alleged that the two players had acted aggressively when stopped, and had insulted a police officer.

As punishment, the two players were made to train in isolation for the rest of the season. It was the final straw at Bremen for Arnautovic, who left for Stoke City that summer. Elia stayed, however, though there was little change in his behaviour.

This month alone, the 27-year-old has been at the centre of two social media scandals. Before the derby game against Hamburg, Elia tweeted the words “Ready for War”, a phrase which doesn't go down too well in Germany. He later insulted a Bremen fan on Facebook, telling them to “go f*** yourself”.

On the pitch, too, Elia has repeatedly failed to live up to expectations, with only four goals in 66 appearances for Bremen.

New coach Viktor Skripnik accused the player of arrogance, saying that 'It would be nice to see a bit more effort from him. He needs to realise that his job is about more than just annoying his team mates.'

A flop on the pitch, a perpetual irritation off it, Bremen were desperate to get rid of Elia. 'He is a good player, but he hasn't really performed for us. When a player with this kind of contract isn't even in the squad, you have to think about moving him on', said Director of Sport Rouven Schroder.

Perhaps wary of his reputation, Southampton declined to buy Elia straight away, but the Saints do will have that option in the summer. Whether they act on it will depend on Ronald Koeman. If the Dutch manager can realise his compatriot's potential, credit to him. If not, St. Mary's may spend the next six months plagued by the poor man's Balotelli.
