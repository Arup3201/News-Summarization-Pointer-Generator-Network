Tragic: Ritchie Allsop, 13, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was found hanged in December 2011

A 13-year-old schoolboy was found hanged by his old school tie which he used to do pull-ups.

Ritchie Allsop, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, had been arguing with his sister Skye, 11, before the death and his new mobile phone had ended up in a sink of water, an inquest heard.

He retrieved the phone and tried to dry it out but was later found dead by his mother Lisa Brown when she arrived home from work. She described her ‘hyperactive’ son’s death as a tragic accident.

A coroner ruled out suicide, and Miss Brown, 41, told the inquest at Sheffield Coroner’s Court that Ritchie was always ‘messing about’ and often lay on his bed playing about with the tie.

She said: ‘I found out after the event that the tie had already been suspended on his bottom bunk.

'He often used to put his legs in it and his neck and mess about. It had been there for a while.’

She earlier said that Skye told her Ritchie used to play around with the tie ‘all the time’ and the girl had told him off over fears he would hurt himself.

‘The way I found him I think he's just slipped while he's been messing,’ she said. ‘He was hyperactive, he was continually talking about rubbish. He was interested in everything that went on and everything around him. He was just daft and silly and always laughing.

'Sometimes he would get stressed out and kick off but he was full of life. He had lots of friends. He would have spoken to me or his elder brother Jamie if anything was worrying him.’

She said her son had no reason to hurt himself, he had never tried to hang himself in the past and he had never spoken to anyone of self-harming.

A 16-year-old friend of Ritchie said he had had just changed schools but never mentioned any problems with bullying.

He
got on ‘really, really well’ but often had arguments with his sister 
although they would soon calm down. He said the tie had been in 
Ritchie's bedroom for about a year.

‘He used to do pull-ups with it,’ the friend said. He had never seen Ritchie down or depressed. ‘He used to pull a face and look at me then start laughing,’ the friend added.

Ritchie loved ‘messing about’ with his friends and family and would often play jokes on them. ‘He would play tricks and joke about,’ the friend said.

Detective Constable Gary Henshaw, who 
investigated the incident which happened in December 2011, said there 
were no suspicious circumstances about the death.

‘There
were no issues at school, he was very settled in and happy and 
outgoing,’ he said. ‘A child had posted an entry on Facebook saying a 
bully was involved but it was just a throwaway remark. There was no 
substance to it.’

'The way I found him I think he's just slipped while he's been messing. He was hyperactive, he was continually talking about rubbish. He was interested in everything that went on and everything around him'

Police officers examined his mobile phone and laptop computer. ‘There was nothing at all to cause us any concern and no indication of unhappiness,’ he said.

That day Ritchie had cycled to his father’s house with his brother and returned home to play games and watch TV before he started arguing with his sister about 4pm.

‘The argument continued and at some point Ritchie's new phone got knocked into the sink and it is assumed it had been damaged with water,’ he said.

Miss Brown said Skye had been over to the pub where she worked as a supervisor at 5.55pm to tell her she had been arguing with Ritchie. She told her daughter: ‘Come on, we're going straight home.’

Skye told her she had knocked her brother's phone into the sink and Miss Brown went to her son's bedroom ‘to see what had gone off’. She found her son hanged.

Assistant deputy coroner Louise Slater said there was ‘absolutely’ no evidence of suicide and she added: ‘I don't think we have established exactly what was going on.’

She recorded a narrative verdict which said: ‘Ritchie Allsop died as a consequence of suspension by ligature at his home. There is no indication how he came to be in that position and intention remains wholly unclear.'
