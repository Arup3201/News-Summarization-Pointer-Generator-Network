The Minnesota Vikings released cornerback A.J. Jefferson on Monday, just a few hours after he was arrested and jailed on a domestic assault complaint.

Jefferson was arrested at his home in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, after his 23-year-old girlfriend reported that at 4:30 a.m. she had been choked during a dispute.

According to Hennepin County records, Jefferson is being held without bail, and formal charges were not expected on Monday.Â

Jefferson, 25, was booked at the jail just before 7 a.m. and the Vikings announced the roster move less than five hours later.

Coach Leslie Frazier said he couldn't comment on Jefferson's status or the reasoning behind his release. Jefferson hurt his neck on Sunday at Green Bay and didn't play in the second half.

He has seen limited action the last two seasons since being acquired in a trade with Arizona, primarily in nickel and dime packages and as an injury fill-in.

Jefferson became the second Vikings player arrested this month. Wide receiver Jerome Simpson was recently charged with driving while impaired.
