Martin Skrtel was disappointed at Liverpool's failure to beat Arsenal, despite his goal deep into stoppage time salvaging a 2-2 draw for the Reds.

The Slovakia international powered home a header from Adam Lallana's ball into the box to rescue a point for 10-man Liverpool, who had dominated the game for long periods.

Brendan Rodgers' side shifted to three at the back and that caused Arsenal problems throughout, with the hosts dominating possession, but they were unable to make it count.

'Obviously we wanted to get the three points today but being down one goal and to equalise in the last minute is good, but we are disappointed we couldn't win,' Skrtel told Sky Sports 1.

Philippe Coutinho gave the Reds a deserved lead on the stroke of half-time with a delightful finish, but it lasted little over a minute as Mathieu Debuchy won an aerial duel with Skrtel to make it 1-1 at the break.

Skrtel was culpable again as Olivier Giroud peeled off him at the near post to put Arsenal into a 2-1 lead against the run of play just after the hour mark.

When substitute Fabio Borini saw red for two rash moments it looked like it was slipping away from Liverpool, but Skrtel made the most of the nine minutes of stoppage time - which were a direct result of a head injury he suffered - to atone for his mistakes and earn the Reds a point.

'It was a great cross from Adam and I had a header before, but I've been waiting quite a while for a goal so I'm really happy,' he added.

Lallana, who looked bright for the hosts, echoed Skrtel's sentiments and now wants them to kick on over the festive period.

'I thought we were the dominant team throughout the whole game and we created enough to get the victory but that's the way it's been going for us lately,' he said.

'We can take a little bit of momentum out of that goal into the Christmas period but we've got games coming up that are winnable and we need to start turning these good performances into wins.' 

Rodgers was delighted with his side, surprisingly heralding their display as being better than the corresponding game last season which Liverpool won 5-1.

'Our performance today was better than our 5-1 here last year. There's no question about that. The dominance we had today was fantastic (and with all) the efforts on goal,' he said.

The former Swansea boss highlighted how the passing and movement of his side caused problems for the Gunners but admitted he was frustrated by the goals they conceded.

Even though the 41-year-old felt Alexis Sanchez dived to secure the free-kick that led to Debuchy's leveller, he pointed out that the Reds' failure to clear it on three occasions was simply not good enough.

'We thoroughly deserved to be at least one up after the first half, but we made bad decisions defensively. I don't think it was a free-kick, I think Sanchez has dived to get the free-kick and the referee bought it,' Rodgers said.

'But then we've got to be better in the box. It's not about organisation it's about winning the duel and we lost three so from being 1-0 up and total domination we found ourselves 1-1 at half-time."

The Liverpool boss was also critical of the space afforded to Giroud for the second goal, but he had no complaints about Borini's sending off.

Referee Michael Oliver showed Borini his first yellow card after he threw the ball away in anger and then the Italian was given his marching orders shortly after for a high tackle on Santi Cazorla.

'Fabio was just keen to come on and affect the game,' Rodgers added. 'He picked up a silly booking for the first one, showing his passion, and obviously the foot up on the second one so there's no excuse.'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had no complaints about Borini's sending off at Anfield 

Rodgers' opposite number Arsene Wenger felt the draw was the right result and conceded his side struggled to get going in the first half.

'It was an intense game. Of course we have the regret that we conceded on a set piece in the last minute but maybe overall a fair result,' he said.

'My first job is to win the games and if you can win them and be fair it's even better, but regret dominates tonight. When you're 2-1 up with two minutes to go you want to win the game and overall, objectively, 2-2 is a fair result.'
