The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has married the son of one of the country's most powerful officials, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said today.

Kim Yo Jong, who is 27 or 28, was said by state media late last year to have assumed a senior position in the ruling Workers' Party. 

She is the only other member of the ruling Kim family known to have an official job within the government, other than Kim Jong-un.

A Chinese source said: 'As far as I know, Kim Yo Jong, deputy director of the Workers' Party, got married to a son of the party secretary Choe Ryong Hae.'

According to the source, the lucky man is Choe Song, second son of Choe senior.

The elder Choe is a high-ranking member of the Workers' Party and widely seen as a close confidant of supreme ruler Kim.

Kim Yo Jong was seen wearing what appears to be a wedding ring in a photo released by the reclusive North's official KCNA news agency today. 

Kim Yo Jong was spotted wearing a wedding ring when she was photographed visiting an orphanage on New Year's Day with her despot brother Kim. 

She is the only member of his family to have a significant role in his regime, where he has been installed as deputy director of the Workers' Party. 

Sources claim that Kim's sister and Choe Song got married some time in December. Earlier last year it was believed that his father Choe Ryong Hae, may have fallen out of favour when he had not been seen in public for some time.
