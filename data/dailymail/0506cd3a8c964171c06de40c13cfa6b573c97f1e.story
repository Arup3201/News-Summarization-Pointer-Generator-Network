This grand Oxfordshire manor was once home to a 10th Century Archbishop of Canterbury, but now contains little more than empty rooms and forgotten memories. 

Covered in dust and mould, it's hard to imagine Great Tew Manor in its former glory as a home to everyone from Norman aristocrats to key members of the Royalist army during the English Civil War.

Built in 990, the forgotten manor house sits in Oxfordshire's picturesque Cotswold Hills, and was photographed by an urban explorer known only as Urbex-SW, who decided to visit Great Tew to explore the grandeur of the house first hand.

Historic: Built in 990, the forgotten manor house sits in Oxfordshire's picturesque Cotswold Hills, and was photographed by an urban explorer known only as Urbex-SW

Religious: The four floor grand manor was originally built for Elfric of Abingdon, who became Archbishop of Canterbury's in 995. Elfric died in 1005, leaving Great Tew to Saint Alban's Abbey who leased it out between 1049 and 1052

Forgotten: An old copy of The Times newspaper found inside Great Tew Manor shows the date Friday November 7, 1969

Conquest: Shortly after the Norman invasion of 1066, William the Conqueror granted the manor to his step-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and it was recorded amongst Odo's estates in the Domesday Book in 1086

Wreck: Photographer Urbex-SW said he felt quite nervous visiting the manor. The upper floors are falling through, which made walking on them a scary experience

Urbex-SW said: 'I have visited a lot of great places before this, but Great Tew Manor looked very grand. It's not very often locations like this are found.'

'Within the building you can find stunning woodwork dating back hundreds of years... There are newspapers from 1969 and letters dated 1905, along with bundles of old papers, bottles and a stunning spiral staircase,' he added.

'I felt quite nervous visiting the manor. The upper floors within the property were falling through, which made walking on them a very scary experience,' the photographer went on to say.

The four floor grand manor was originally built for Elfric of Abingdon, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 995.

Elfric died in 1005, leaving Great Tew to Saint Alban's Abbey who leased in out between 1049 and 1052.

Shortly after the Norman invasion of 1066, William the Conqueror granted the manor to his step-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and it was recorded amongst Odo's estates in the Domesday Book in 1086.

In 1611 Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, bought Great Tew estate from local landowner Edward Rainsford.

Tanfield
 deprived the villagers of timber, causing some of the cottages to fall 
into disrepair, and eventually enclosed part of the land in 1622. The 
majority of the site was not fully closed to public access until 1767, 
however, when parliament passed the Enclosure Act for Great Tew.

Urbex-SW said he has visited a lot of great places before this, but Great Tew Manor was particularly grand. He added: 'It's not very often locations like this are found'

Intriguing: A letter sent from Lincoln's Inn in London and dated 1905 was found in one of the many rooms at the abandoned Great Tew Manor

Changing hands: In 1611 Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, bought Great Tew estate from local landowner Edward Rainsford

Shortly after Tanfield died in 1626, Great Tew passed to his son-in-law Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. In the 1630s Cary gathered the famous 'Great Tew Circle' of writers and scholars, including Abraham Cowley, Ben Jonson and Edmund Waller

The group, who met regularly at the building, would include some of the most important clerics and literary figures of the 17th Century

Loyalist: During the English Civil War Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, fought on the Royalist side and was killed in 1643 at the First Battle of Newbury

During the English Civil War the young Viscount fought on the Royalist side and was killed in 1643 at the First Battle of Newbury. Great Tew remained in the Cary family until the death of Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland in 1694.

In 1780, Great Tew estate was bought by George Stratton who made his fortune through the East India Company. He died in March 1800 and was succeeded by his son George Frederick Stratton, who was the first to let the building fall into disrepair.

In 1815–16 Matthew Robinson Boulton bought Great Tew Estate and it remained in the Boulton family until an M.E. Boulton died without heirs in 1914.

The Great Tew estate has been owned by the Johnston family since the 1960's.

Urbex-SW says: 'For me, the most interesting thing were the old letters, the wood work within the main hall and the different textures throughout the building.. It's not something you see in every derelict building so was certainly interesting.'

'Generally, people are shocked that such a historic manor is sat decaying away in the middle of such a wealthy area such as Oxfordshire,' he added.
