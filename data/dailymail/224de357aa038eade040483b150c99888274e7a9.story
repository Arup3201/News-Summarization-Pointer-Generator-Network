Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis is going to be a father for the first time after he and his girlfriend has revealed that they are expecting twins.

The 40-year-old video producer, who made his fortune by filming topless teenagers and college students partying on Spring Break, said that it should be obvious why he and his girlfriend wanted to select the gender of their children.

'I believe people will finally understand my love, respect and admiration for women. I love girls,' he told Us Weekly.

Expecting: Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis and his girlfriend of two years Abbey Wilson used IVF to pick the sex of their twins and they said that they were only interested in having girls

Purposeful search: Francis met Abbey Wilson when she won his magazine's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America' contest in 2012

Gender selection is not an open 
practice, particularly for couples having their first children, but some
 doctors do bend the rules.

Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and India all have outright bans on genetic selection for non-medical purposes, but the United States does not.

In
 the United States, pre-natal genetic diagnosis tests are available 
which allows the couple to determine the gender of the embryo before it 
is implanted.

Fertility clinics make their own rules on where they stand in the issue, so certain clinics allow sex selection on any grounds while others dictate that couples need a medical reason- like certain developmental disorders or genetic diseases- as grounds for dictating the sex. 

An example of a more loose interpretation of the law used by some couples is when they already have several children of the same sex and opt to use IVF to make sure their next child is the opposite sex.

Francis, who has long been a hero to 
teenage boys in spite of his multiple lawsuits and arrests, has been 
dating his 26-year-old girlfriend for two years.

He was introduced to Abbey Wilson when she won Girls Gone Wild's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America'.

'We both wanted girls and we wanted them to be healthy and free of genetic diseases so we chose to do IVF,' Wilson told Us Weekly.

'I have always heard women say you just know when you are pregnant and I totally understand that now. 

'Your body, smell, sensitivity and cravings all change and mine did from day one. I found out shortly after a blood test confirmed the results and called Joe immediately, we were both screaming and so loud with excitement from each end of the phone!'

The due date has not been announced.

They said that their famous friends have been very supportive and helpful in doling out parenting advice. 

'Kourtney
 and Scott were the first in the Kardashian family we told and they have
 already given us so much amazing advice,' Francis said.

Wilson also noted that Mario and Courtney Lopez had taken them baby shopping already.

Francis' notoriety came with the launch of his company Girls Gone Wild in the late 1990s.

His
 crew would go to debaucherous events like Mardi Gras and Spring Break 
resorts to make videos of female college students who took their tops 
off in front of the camera.

Business
 boomed: the company was established formally in 1997 and had profits of
 more than $20million in their first two years. In their first five 
years, they had created more than 80 different Girls Gone Wild videos. 

The
 films, like 'Girls Gone Wild: Horny Schoolgirls – Orgy Party' and 
'Girls Gone Wild: Sex Starved Young & Horny', were available on 
pay-per-view channels and later through a streaming service on their 
website.

A string of lawsuits and Francis' own personal criminal troubles contributed to the downward spiral of the company, and Girls Gone Wild filed for bankruptcy in February of last year. 

Francis spent time in jail after 
pleading no contest to child abuse and prostitution charges in 2008 and 
spent nearly a year in jail.

 recently, he was charged with false imprisonment and assault in 2013 
stemming from a night in 2011 in which he grabbed a woman by the neck 
and slammed her head into the floor of his soon-to-be repossessed home.

Francis became violent when he tried 
to separate one woman from a group of three that went back to his home 
against their will and they objected. He then tried intimidating the 
other two into not calling the police.

In
 2012, Francis was ordered by a judge to pay $19million to casino 
magnate Steve Wynn in a defamation lawsuit. He was sentenced to 270 days
 in jail and forced to complete and anger management course.

He later said that he was wrongly accused and accepted the plea deal in order to end his time in jail.
