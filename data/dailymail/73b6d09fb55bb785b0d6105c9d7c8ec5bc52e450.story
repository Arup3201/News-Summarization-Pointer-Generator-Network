Many women and A-listers spend thousands of pounds dressing themselves in dazzling couture gowns made from the most luxurious materials available.

But one photographer has showcased the unlikely elegance one of the world's cheapest materials can exude when crafted stylishly.

Iban Montero has unveiled an editorial featuring gorgeous gowns, hats, skirts and waistcoats that could easily be mistaken for designs by Christian Dior or Philip Treacy. But there is one difference: these dresses are made from paper.
