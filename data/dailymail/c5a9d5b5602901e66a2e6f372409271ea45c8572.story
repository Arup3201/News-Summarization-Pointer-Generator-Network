It seems to be a question of when rather than if Chelsea win the Premier League this season, and Bloomberg Sports predict they will wrap up the title on May 2.

The world leaders in sports analytic technology calculate the percentage probabilities for league finishes using their match analysis, with Jose Mourinho's side final points total projected at 90.

Their previous annual predictions had Manchester City winning the league but the reigning champions are now expected to finish eight points behind Chelsea, with Manchester United and Arsenal completing the top four.

Chelsea are flying in the Premier League so far this season and are expected to wrap up the title on May 2

Manchester City won the title last season but are projected to finish eight points behind the eventual winners

Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are tipped to complete the top three by Bloomberg Sports

Bloomberg power ratings and multiple data points from numerous seasons of every team are analysed

Once this Bloomberg Sports rating is calculated using the data above, each match of the 2013-14 season was simulated 100,000 times providing an accurate sample

League projections are based on probability of finishing top, in Champions League positions, top or bottom half, or chance of relegation

Goals for and goals against also taken into consideration

Accuracy is tested against bookmaker odds, with strong results

League table is updated throughout the season 

The data analysts say there is a 21.1 per cent chance of the Blues clinching the title in their first fixture in May against Crystal Palace, with three games remaining.

Somewhat surprisingly, Chelsea's closest rivals at present, Southampton, are tipped to come eighth, 13 points outside the Champions League places, with a 2.2 per cent chance of finishing fourth or above.

That is because Ronald Koeman's in-form Saints have yet to face any several so called 'bigger' sides, such as Bloomberg Sports' projected top four.

Things aren't looking good for Arsene Wenger and Arsenal at present, but they are expected to qualify for the Champions League for an 18th time in a row, in what could be a tense final day of the season.

The data has just seven points separating the Gunners, Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton, while West Ham are tipped to finish in 11th despite their fine start to the season.

It could be an unsuccessful season for the Premier League newcomers, with Burnley, QPR and Leicester pictured in the graphic finishing in the relegation zone. They all currently occupy the bottom three places.

However, Hull City, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa could also threaten those spots with a relegation percentage above 20.

Southampton are Chelsea's nearest challengers this season but have a 2.2 per cent chance of a top four finish

It could be another sorry top-flight season for QPR, who are predicted to go down under Harry Redknapp

Chelsea replicating Arsenal's 'Invincibles' season has been mentioned, with Mourinho's men still unbeaten in the league.

And while Bloomberg Sports may not be able to predict such astonishing feats, perhaps it would be best to pencil in the fixture against Palace at the beginning of May.

It may be time to witness another Stamford Bridge title party.
