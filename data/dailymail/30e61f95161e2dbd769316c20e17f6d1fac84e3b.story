Federal senator Cory Bernardi has renewed his call for a nationwide ban of the burqa after he spotted women wearing them at the homes of those arrested in Thursday's terror raids.

The Liberal senator from South Australia tweeted that  'some burqa wearers' spotted inside houses which police raided represented the 'shroud of oppression'. 

The women were pictured in the raids to foil a possible terror plots planned in Sydney and Brisbane.

Homes  were searched  by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police and 15 people were arrested with one charged.

Following the raids Senator Bernardi tweeted to his 13,000 followers that Australia should ban the burqa completely after linking the head dress with suspects of terrorism.

'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust(ralia),' Senator Bernardi tweeted on Thursday.

Mr Bernardi told Daily Mail Australia that his tweet was in line with previous comments he had made about 'security and identification issues associated with facial coverings.'

'This has led to some changes in state laws in Australia,' he said.

'I stand by my previous concerns.'

The senator wrote an opinion piece published in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2010 in which he wrote 'In my mind, the burqa has no place in Australian society.'

'I would go as far as to say it is un-Australian.'

To me, the burqa represents the repressive domination of men over women, which has no place in our society and compromises some of the most important aspects of human communication,' he wrote. 

Cory Bernardi has been condemned by The Liberals, Labor and The Greens over his tweet

Both sides of the political divide, including The Greens, have criticised the senator for his most recent tweet.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said  acts of terrorism should not be associated with what people wear or their religious affiliation.

'This isn't about people's religion. It's not about what people wear. It's about potential terror attacks here in Australia,' he told reporters in the Northern Territory.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Senator Bernardi's comments were stupid.

'The last thing we need at a time like this are ignorant comments from government MPs that feed prejudice,' Mr Shorten said.

Senator Bernardi has been a frequent critic of the burqa, saying it raises security and identification concerns.

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said she would rather Australia ban Mr Bernardi.

'Ban the burqa? Really? If only we could #BanTheBernardi,' she tweeted.

In 2010 senator Bernardi called for a ban on the burqa saying the clothing was 'unAustralian'

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman warned against racial vilification following the raids.

He said Australians should not use Thursday's operation as an opportunity to disrupt community relationships.

'If anybody uses what's happened to vilify a group, race or religion they are playing into the hands of these would-be-terrorists.'

'That is, helping the terrorist organisations to achieve what they want to achieve.'

Mr Shorten said he had 'no time for Senator Bernardi's stupid comments'.

'The last thing we need at a time like this are ignorant comments from government MPs that feed prejudice,' he said.

'We must refuse to submit to this type of fear and intolerance.'

Senator Bernardi hit back at Mr Shorten, saying the Labor leader was in no position to offer criticism.

'Given Bill Shorten was part of a government that wanted to facilitate sharia-compliant finance laws in our country, his lack of understanding on this matter speaks for itself,' he told Fairfax Media.
