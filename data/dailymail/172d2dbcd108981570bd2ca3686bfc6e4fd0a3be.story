It was the summer of 2011 and Liverpool had launched an aggressive, expensive revolution of their playing squad.

With Andy Carroll having arrived for £35million in January that year, along with £23million Luis Suarez, Kenny Dalglish was determined to bring in more quality and give Liverpool the options and depth they had been lacking.

So in came Charlie Adam (£9million from Blackpool); Stewart Downing (£20million from Aston Villa) was the main priority to provide service from the flanks, while Jose Enrique (£7million from Newcastle) and Sebastian Coates (£7million from Nacional) came in to bolster the defence.

Among all those transactions, however, one stood out. The decision to recruit a young midfielder from Sunderland for £16million left many wondering whether Liverpool had been spending lavishly for the sake of it. £16million for Jordan Henderson, they asked. Really?

Look at him now. Of the group that arrived in 2011, Henderson is the only one who is a regular for Liverpool – Enrique is still at the club but his long-term prospects are hardly bright – and there are no longer questions about whether he is worth £16million.

Quite the opposite, in fact. Henderson’s progress since he has been at Anfield is a prime example of what determination, hard work and a refusal to give up can achieve and Brendan Rodgers’ decision to make him vice-captain is his latest reward.

Had Henderson wanted the easy life, he could have chosen to take up an offer from Fulham in August 2012, when they asked about his availability during negotiations with Liverpool over Clint Dempsey. He could have walked away from Merseyside and disappeared out of view.

That, though, is not his style. Rodgers was delighted when Henderson told him he wanted to stay and fight and in the past two seasons he has grown from someone who could not hold down a place in Liverpool’s starting line-up to become one of the first names selected for club and country.

‘The first summer I came here, Jordan had the opportunity to leave,’ Rodgers recalled. ‘We were talking about it the other day. I did not push him out or ask him to go. But, like I do with all the players if a club comes in, I present them with the opportunity they may have.

I said “listen, you have a chance to go to Fulham and you can go and play every week, or you can stay here. I can’t guarantee you a game straight away, but I know one thing for sure, I will improve you as a player.” He wanted to stay.

‘I felt that first period being out of the team helped him tactically as we could work on video and analyse his game. From that he has grown in confidence. You see now for club and country he holds himself really well, he’s got a great stature and I think he will be around here for years to come.’

It is why Rodgers decided late last week to make him Steven Gerrard’s deputy following Daniel Agger’s return to Brondby. Henderson is not the finished article yet but he is progressing at a rapid pace and there is no down he will be a long-term influence for Liverpool.

‘His attitude when I was at Liverpool was tremendous from day one,’ Comolli recently recalled. ‘He looked at what Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher were doing, how they behaved, what they did in training I’m not surprised he’s doing well to be honest. With Jordan it was just a question of time.’

His relentless energy, his strength and running power are vital components in this Liverpool team and it did not gone unnoticed how much of a difference his absence made when he was suspended for three games towards the end of last season.

That Henderson’s absence was lamented then showed where he has elevated himself to. The young man who was deemed to represent some of former Director of Football Damien Comolli’s excess is now likely to become a Liverpool stalwart.

Put it another way: if they were now looking to buy an English midfielder, who was 24 with a history of being constantly fit and available for games and can pop up with goals, £16million wouldn’t come close to it. Looking back now, the fee Liverpool paid for Henderson actually appears to be a bargain.
