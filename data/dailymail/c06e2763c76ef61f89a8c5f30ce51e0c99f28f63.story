A British holidaymaker who was caught driving at 110mph on New Zealand’s west coast claims he was speeding because his father had diarrhoea.

Peter Lee, 47, offered the excuse when a police officer stopped him for driving at nearly double the 60mph speed limit.

Mr Lee, who has had bankruptcy proceedings in the UK, has been ordered to pay a fine of more than NZD$1,000 (about £500) or spend a short amount of time in jail.

The incident involving a British holidaymaker comes after a series of crashes involving foreign drivers

Mr Lee, from Kent, was charged in New Zealand’s Queenstown District Court with dangerous driving on State Highway 6, near Hokitika, stuff.co.nz reported.

Police said his claim that his father, a passenger, was ill with diarrhoea did not wash, and he was arrested and his rental car contract was cancelled.

Mr Lee was in possession of £20 and NZD$365 (approximately £180) when he was arrested, and lawyer Sonia Vidal told court that his father was covering the costs of the trip.

Judge Michael Crosbie said Mr Lee would be arrested at Auckland’s airport if a fine is imposed and he fails to pay it, stuff.co.nz reported.

Mr Lee is scheduled to return to court tomorrow with enough funds to pay a fine.

The judge told court: ‘I would be setting an untenable precedent if everyone on the road thought they could get away with a fine [for excessive speed]. There are already enough mixed messages out there about our roads or road abuse.

‘It should not be lost on him the maximum penalty is three months' jail. Unless he can make arrangements to pay he can go off to prison.’

A driver from Christchurch snatched car keys from a tourist who crossed the centre line at Lindis Pass

It comes as tourist drivers face greater scrutiny in New Zealand following a series of fatal crashes and confrontations with locals.

Last week, a local motorist punched a tourist driver in the face in the town of Greymouth, leading police to urge residents not to take matters into their own hands, the New Zealand Herald reported.

Police said the assault occurred for no reason at all.

In recent weeks, locals have snatched car keys from at least four tourists who were accused of driving dangerously. In the latest incident, a foreign driver was filmed crossing the centre line in a rental car in the Lindis Pass, the Otago Daily Times reported.

A Christchurch man who was following the tourist took his keys and showed the video to police, who ticketed the holidaymaker and had his rental contract revoked.
