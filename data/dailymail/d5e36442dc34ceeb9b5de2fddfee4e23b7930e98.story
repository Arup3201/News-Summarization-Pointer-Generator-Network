Of all the tricky tasks we have to learn as children, walking is perhaps the most difficult.

So spare a thought for this little girl who has been filmed trying to walk on ice for the first time.

In the video Polina, thought to be from Russia, can been seen stamping around on a frozen puddle.

A little girl, thought to be called Polina, from Russia, was filmed trying to walk on ice for the first time

she slips but manages to use her arms to expertly balance and stop herself from falling over

While she initially enjoys the crunching sound it makes, she suddenly realises that this new surface is slippery as she loses her balance.

Flailing her arms, she expertly manages to stay upright but when she bends down for a closer look  everything goes horribly wrong.

As she lays her hand on the ice she accidentally over-balances, tipping forward as her feet slide out from under her.

However curiosity gets the better of her and she bends down to get a closer look at the ice

Having saved herself earlier the girl's feet suddenly slide out from under her and she ends up face down

She ends up bent over double with her head meeting the ice with a soft crunch.

Despite face-planting the frosty soil, there are no tears as she is protected by her huge pink winter coat.

The video has attracted around half a million views since it was posted on YouTube a week ago, and has been circulating on social networking sites this morning. 

Twitter user Vicky Crystal commented: 'So cute - and, she has an excuse because ice is new to her. This could be me - every year!'

Emma Saunders added: 'This has made my morning already.'
