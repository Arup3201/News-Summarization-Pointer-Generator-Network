Celtic were dealt a Glasgow derby in the quarter-finals of the League Cup — despite missing out on a long-awaited clash with Rangers once again.

The Parkhead side notched their first clean sheet in nine games by beating Championship leaders Hearts 3-0 before a crowd of around 18,000 in the last 16.

And their reward is a home clash with Partick Thistle as Rangers were pitched up against St Johnstone at Ibrox instead.

John Guidetti fires Celtic into the lead against Hearts 

Celtic were aided by a dreadful penalty miss from Osman Sow 

Rangers join their Glasgow rivals in the quarter-finals with Ian Black getting on the scoresheet 

‘I said I would take whatever was coming and now we get Partick Thistle,’ said Deila.

‘That’s a difficult match as well, but the good thing is it’s at home.

‘We love to play in front of our fans in our stadium and you could see tonight how much the players enjoyed expressing themselves in front of them.

‘I think tonight was a very good performance and I’ve been delighted to see a team which works very hard.’

Deila also praised new striker John Guidetti, who is on loan from Manchester City, after he scored his first goal for the club.

Two penalties in a minute then saw Osman Sow waste the chance to level for Hearts before Kris Commons put the game beyond the Tynecastle men.

Insisting his team would have won even if Hearts had levelled, however, Deila added: ‘I am very pleased with the performance and I think we look much stronger now.

‘We deserved to win tonight and would have even if they had scored for 1-1.

‘The team were 100 per cent switched on and that’s what we want in every game now.’

An own goal from Tynecastle full-back Adam Eckersely completed a disappointing night for Robbie Neilson’s side.

But Guidetti’s first goal for Celtic was the highlight for a sparse home crowd, with Deila predicting many more for the Swedish striker.

‘John is a fantastic personality and someone we are looking forward to having here,’ added the Norwegian. ‘He has a big talent.

It was smiles all around as Jason Cummings (left) celebrates with goalscorer Dominique Malonga 

‘He hasn’t played first-team football for two years – since he was 19 years old.

‘So his energy is unbelievable but he has further to go to get his potential out.

‘We have seen in Holland what he did there when he had a long season with games at Feyenoord.

‘He scored 23 goals in 26 matches so we have high expectations for him.

‘If he did that in Holland then he can do it in Scotland – that I am sure of.’

In the other quarter-final ties, holders Aberdeen will face Hamilton, who disposed of Motherwell last night, at Pittodrie, while Hibs host Dundee United after they emerged victorious from the Tayside derby.
