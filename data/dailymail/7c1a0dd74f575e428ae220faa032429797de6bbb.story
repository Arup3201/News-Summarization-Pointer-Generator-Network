Holidaymakers who splurge on the fancy new Apple Watch won’t have to worry about getting locked out of their hotel room.

At least one major chain is working on an app to prevent that from happening.

When the watch hits stores in 2015, the Starwood Hotels app will allow guests to unlock their hotel room doors without having to fumble with a key or dig through a bag to find a key card.

With the Apple Watch acting as a digital room key, guests who have a compatible iPhone will simply have to tap a button while standing at the door.

The app was featured during Apple’s unveiling earlier this week and it will be used at some of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide’s properties, which include the Westin, Sheraton, W and Aloft brands, starting next spring.

But the Apple Watch won’t come cheap when it goes on sale in 2015. Prices will start at $349 (£215) in the US.

Pricing has not been announced for the UK.

Apps that unlock hotel room doors are the wave of the future as hotel and travel companies attempt to make holidays more convenient. Hilton Hotels has also announced plans to replace keys with smartphones.

American Airlines is partnering with the tech giant to create an Apple Watch app that will allow travellers to manage their bookings.

Starwood recently made headlines when it announced that it would be using a robot butler at its Aloft boutique hotel in California’s Silicon Valley.

Known as the Botlr, the robotic bellhop is designed to ferry amenities from the front desk to any of the hotel’s 150 rooms in just three minutes or less.
