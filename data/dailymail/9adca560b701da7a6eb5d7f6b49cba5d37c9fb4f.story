Three Australian venues and two American hotels have rejected appearances by controversial pick-up artist Julien Blanc as a social media campaign to end his world tour gathers pace. 

Blanc, a 'dating coach' whose techniques include choking women and then hushing them, planned to hold seminars in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane over the first fortnight of November.

But he is quickly finding himself without a place to host his events after outraged activists took to the phones and social media to #TakeDownJulienBlanc.

'#ChokeOpen': One of Julien Blanc's techniques to seduce women involves grasping them in a chokehold

1. Yelling 'Pikachu!' and placing their heads on his crotch

'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want,' Blanc says, in a seminar recorded on video. 

'I'm just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls heads, just like, "head, on d***", "head, on d***", yelling "Pikachu!" with a Pikachu shirt.'  

2. 'Deadly' jokes

A blog post on Blanc's 'Real Social Dynamics Nation' website appears to suggest using cruel jokes as a way of picking up women. 

The post is titled '"My Girlfriend Passed Away" - The Twisted Humor That Inevitably Knifes Through To Her Panties. 

Explanatory YouTube videos placed in the article have been taken down. 

A Tinder exchange also published on Blanc's website shows a person, who is chatting up a woman on the dating app, suggesting that the person's father had died.

'I just buried my father today.. Who would lie about something like that,' the person writes.  

3. The 'choke opener'

Blanc is pictured choking women and hushing them in multiple Instagram posts. In one caption, written on October 10, he dubs this his 'choke opener', a means of starting a seductive conversation with women. 

4. Use 'pull talk' 

In a video on the RSD Nation website, Blanc encourages his fans to use 'pull talk' - or, 'spewing bulls***' - while physically leading women to the 'sex location'.

'Your words? Spewing bulls***,' he explains. '(They are) wizard stories, pull talk!'

'It's very light hearted, it's very fun, it's kind of like: "Oh yeah so when this, oh yeah and what about this.

 'Just any f***ing thing you want to say and again, your actions are making it happen. '

'Your actions are taking the responsibility off of her, they're leading, it's not permission seeking, and that is how you move closer to the sex location'.

5. 'Deconstruct her self-esteem' 

Another blog post provides tips about how to 'manipulate' a woman's self esteem.

'Click on this video right now that (sic) reveals how to deconstruct any girl's self-esteem,' the post says. But the clip has since been removed from YouTube. 

'Diss fatties bang hotties': Julien Blanc's controversial techniques have been deemed 'sexist' and 'racist'

Blanc has been pictured taking women into a chokehold at venues around the world

The Como Melbourne have ditched his Thursday seminar after the petition attracted more than 11,000 signatures

The Como Hotel Melbourne, St Kilda West Best Beach Bather's Pavilion and Brisbane's Mercure hotel have rejected seminars that were to be held by Blanc's company, Real Social Dynamics (RSD).

Blanc calls himself the 'executive coach' at RSD, which he has said is an 'international leader in dating advice'. 

Blanc has not responded to requests for comment despite numerous interview requests from Daily Mail Australia via email, voice message and social media.

Protesters are planning to hold a demonstration against Blanc in St Kilda on Thursday evening, with more than 700 people attending the event on Facebook.

'Julien Blanc is the sad act who thinks sexual harassment and assault = picking up,' the protest page reads. 

'Australia has appalling levels of sexual assault and other violence against women, the last thing we need is someone coming to run workshops on how to do it better.'

Blanc's forthcoming tour to the United States likewise appears in jeopardy. 

Touched down: Blanc wEarlier this year in June, the 'dating coach' charged men $3,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami

The Courtyard Marriott in Seattle tweeted: 'This event will no longer be taking place in our hotel.'

Staff at another venue, the Hilton Garden Hotel in Austin, Texas, wrote on Facebook: 'We will not be having this seminar in our hotel in support of the values we believe in'.

In an interview with SBS's The Feed program last night, campaign organiser Jennifer Li, from Washington DC, said: 'I didn't know this was going to actually take off, I just knew I had to try in order to tell myself, "you know, I did something"'.

In a Change.org petition, initially addressed to Melbourne's Como Hotel, Ms Li labelled Blanc's pick-up techniques 'sexist' and 'racist'.  

'Julien Blanc... has made a living by teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse,' she wrote on the petition.

Ms Li went on to say the hotel should not soil its good name by associating with 'a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game'.  

She asked the hotel to stand up for the women of Australia and around the world and not to host the event which would teach other men 'how to violate and harass women'. 

When the hotel announced its decision, it was bombarded with thanks on social media.

Sian Mann thanked The Como Melbourne for making the move to scrap the seminar

'Good for you... u may just have indirectly saved someone from horror ordeal,' BFavell wrote

The Como even won over some customers by making the decision to cancel the event

Mr Blanc said he started in the pick up game when he read the novel The Game written by Neil Strauss

It's understood the 25-year-old gave a talk in Sydney earlier this week and he is scheduled to head to Japan shortly.

In June, the 'dating coach' charged men $3,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami. 

On his website, Mr Blanc said his interest in picking up girls started when he read The Game - a novel written by Neil Strauss.

In the book, Strauss documents his time learning about picking up women with a secret society of people led by a man only known as 'Mystery'.

'I wasn't a popular kid, and it sucked. But it didn't "really" bother me, until one day I... found a link to The Game,' Mr Blanc wrote on his website, Pimp.

'I read a few pages of it and I was HOOKED. I had to try this whole "walking up and talking to girls I’ve never met before and make them want to sleep with me" thing out... I was so off at first."'
