Donald Sterling's estranged wife issued a strong statement against his racist recordings but new court records have revealed that she also has a history of making incendiary comments about minorities.

Rochelle 'Shelly' Sterling has been legally married to the Clippers owner since 1955 though they have long been described as being separated and estranged.

Court documents discovered by the Los Angeles Times names Shelly as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants, with one African American resident claiming that she called him a 'black motherf*****' during an argument.

Estranged but connected: Donald Sterling's comments got him banned from the NBA but his wife Shelly- the couple is separated- has also been noted as making racist remarks in earlier lawsuits

'I asked her again, I asked her, "would you reduce the rent?"' and she said, ‘who do you think you are, you black motherf*****,' tenant Darrell Rhodes said in the 2009 deposition.

'The way in which she said motherf***** was more lower voiced, under her breath. She said black loud enough for me to hear, she said mother loud enough for me to hear. F— part was a little lower. I had to look at her lips to hear her say it. And I did.'

Still allowed in: Shelly was seen cheering on the Clippers when they won against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, just hours after Donald had been banned indefinitely from the NBA

The incident with Mr Rhodes, which was a part of a larger discrimination case that ended in Sterling paying a $2.75million settlement to the Justice Department, was not the only one that suggests Mrs Sterling's personal beliefs are rather in line with that of her husband.

One of the on-site property managers that the Sterlings employed said in a deposition how Shelly complained about how her minority tenants kept the apartments from staying clean.

'She said, "Oh, my God. This is so filthy. I can’t remodel my apartments the way that I want because Latinos are so filthy,"' manager Maira Oliva said of Shelly.

When asked for clarification about the exact phrasing, Ms Oliva recalled Shelly saying: 'I can’t remodel my building the way I want and that the building was filthy because of the Latinos.'

Mrs Sterling's actions were at the center of an earlier court case, when a different property supervisor accused Shelly of sneaking her way into tenant's apartments by claiming to be a health inspector.

'Sumner Davenport declares that when she worked for Sterling she often accompanied Rochelle Sterling on apartment inspections, that Rochelle Sterling would regularly pose as a government official in order to gain access to tenants’ apartments,' a court order obtained by the Los Angeles Times reads.

The judge reportedly called the accusations 'troubling' but found insufficient evidence to try the case, leading to an out of court settlement with the Housing Rights Center.

Though her husband has been issued a lifetime ban from the NBA and ordered to pay a $2.5million fine, Shelly still has a number of supporters within the basketball family.

The Clipper's coach Doc Rogers told Yahoo News that he spoke to Shelly on Tuesday and 'she has been through as much as anyone as well'.

'It’s a tough one for Shelly, really,' Rivers said following the team's victory against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday. “

'She didn’t do anything wrong either. You have compassion for her. I kept hearing about the girlfriend. I kept thinking, "Shelly is the wife." You know what I mean?'

That sentiment was echoed by former Clippers star Ron Harper who played for the Los Angeles team under the Sterling’s purview for five years before leaving in 1994.

'The only bad part is I know how much his wife loves the team and mostly I feel sad for her,’ Harper told The New York Post.

'When I was there she was very good and kind to me... I was at a game last year, sat down and ate with her. She loves the team and the sport and loves basketball. She knows what’s going on. It’s probably going to hurt her more than him.

'The only way any of those sponsors are going to return is if they sell that team. If he transfers the power over to her, it still feels like he owns that team.'

While Donald Sterling has been banned from attending any NBA games or stepping foot in any facility associated with the Clippers, the same ban has not been extended to his wife.

She was seen at the Tuesday night game and took a seat in the lower bowl area- as opposed to her normal courtside seat.

She was wearing head-to-toe black which is believed to be in support of the player who have been wearing black socks and armbands since the racist recording was released Saturday morning.
