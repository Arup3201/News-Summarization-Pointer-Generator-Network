The Serbian FA have insisted there was no racist chanting at last night's Under 21 match with England - despite the crowd appearing to direct monkey chants towards visiting players

The game descended into a mass brawl involving players and coaching staff after England's stars were pelted with 
missiles as they celebrated a late goal.

Spurs defender Danny Rose was then sent off for kicking the ball 
into the crowd and as he walked off he appeared to be subjected to monkey chants from the home supporters.

He responded by putting his thumbs up 
and then moving both arms under his shoulders in a monkey gesture.

But today the Serbian FA denied there 
were any racist chants before and during the match in Krusevac, instead 
accusing Rose of behaving in an "inappropriate, unsportsmanlike and 
vulgar manner" towards their fans.

Rose had earlier today called for Serbia to be banned after complaining of 
racial abuse and being hit by missiles during his side's 1-0 win last 
night.

The England defender said he had been subjected to monkey taunts long 
before the violent and chaotic scenes which marred the end of the Euro 
2013 play-off.

In a statement on its website, the Serbian FA said: '(The) FA of Serbia 
absolutely refuses (sic) and denies that there were any occurrences of 
racism before and during the match at the stadium in Krusevac.

'Making connection between the seen incident - a fight between members 
of the two teams - and racism has absolutely no ground and we consider 
it to be a total malevolence.

'Unfortunately, after the fourth minute of the additional time and the 
victory goal scored by the guest team, unpleasant scenes were seen on 
the pitch.

'And while most of the English team players celebrated the score, their 
player number three, Danny Rose, behaved in inappropriate, 
unsportsmanlike and vulgar manner towards the supporters on the stands 
at the stadium in Krusevac, and for that he was shown a red card.'

With tensions boiling over, 
players from both sides were involved in angry exchanges before punches 
and kicks were thrown as a brawl erupted among players and coaching 
staff.

The scuffles broke out when 
supporters invaded the field moments after Connor Wickham struck in 
injury time to complete a 2-0 aggregate win and book England's place at 
next summer's tournament.

England
assistant coach Steve Wigley was photographed being manhandled by both 
opposition players and training staff, while England coach Martin Thomas was headbutted by one of his Serbian counterparts.

The Football Association have 
confirmed they have reported 'a number of incidents of racism' to UEFA 
following the match in Krusevac.

In a statement The FA said it 
'condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final 
whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme 
provocation.'

Stuart Pearce told ESPN: 
'I think there were one or two racist incidents that came on from the 
crowd and they have been reported to UEFA, I believe, by ourselves.

'It is in their hands now, they will have to deal with that.

'I am very proud of my players and my staff and very proud of the achievement in getting to a fourth tournament in a row.

'It is very sad, but we are united as a team and a staff.

'A lot is happening in our country 
with regard to stamping out racism and I am very proud of the reaction 
of our players towards the end.

'It is a real shame because over two ties it was a really close game - two good teams going hammer and tongs at each other.

'It is just a shame it was soured in the last few minutes of the second leg of the tie.'

He added: 'Savo Milosevic, their 
technical director, has come to our dressing room and apologised for any
behaviour that was unsavoury.

'I never want to see any football matches end like that, this is a sporting arena.'

Former England star Paul Ince, working
as a pundit on ESPN, has called for Serbia to be banned from tournament
football for 10 years.

He 
said: 'As soon as the players were in the tunnel apparently there were 
issues. The Serbian conditioning coach was apparently jostling and 
getting his face in England players' faces.

Jack
Butland, the England goalkeeper, was peppered throughout the game with 
various objects thrown from the stands. Stuart Pearce had a seat thrown 
at him. Then at the end Danny Rose was racially abused.'

'If it was me they [Serbia] would be kicked out for the next five tournament.'

Ince added he was impressed with the 
way England players behaved adding: 'If you are black, it is hard to 
actually keep control of yourself because you are the one having the 
racist chants.

'From looking at what we have seen on TV, they have done very well to keep cool heads.

'It
is a shame because tomorrow we will be talking about something we don't
want to talk about. What we should be talking about is England 
qualifying for Israel in 2013.'

Serbian hooligans were implicated in 
ugly riots at the Euro 2012 qualifier against Italy in Genoa a year ago,
where the match was abandoned after only seven minutes when fans threw 
flares onto the pitch.

QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, at the 
centre of the racial abuse case involving John Terry, took to Twitter to
take a sarcastic dig at FIFA - and president Sepp Blatter - over their 
handling of racism in football. He wrote: 'I wonder if Blatter is gonna 
say they should just shake hands!??'

The
ugly scenes at the end overshadowed what had been another superb 
defensive performance by England. Protecting a 1-0 lead from the first 
leg, Pearce's men held firm throughout before substitute Connor Wickham 
stroked into an empty goal to complete a 2-0 aggregate success in injury
time.

Wickham's goal with 
the last kick of the match prompted the mayhem as missiles were thrown 
onto the field and the pitch was invaded.

Rose, who had earlier been booked, kicked the ball away angrily and had to be restrained as he reacted to apparent provocation.

Pearce said of the match: 'The important thing, when the dust settles, is we are going to a championship because we deserved to over two legs.

'Our players have put a lot of hard effort and sweat to get there. There is a real collectiveness here. We will let the authorities deal with this.

'All we know is we have given a good account of ourselves over two matches, we have won nine out of 10 matches in qualification and I am very proud of my team.'
