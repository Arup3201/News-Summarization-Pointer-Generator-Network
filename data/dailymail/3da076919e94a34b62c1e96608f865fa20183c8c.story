The bamboo-like plant has extensive roots that can damage pipes and foundations. The stubborn weed has the power to penetrate concrete

Thousands of house sales are being hit by the spread of Japanese knotweed.

Buyers are spending money on fees and surveys only to be told they cannot get a mortgage on a blighted property.

Homeowners are facing bills of up to £20,000 to remove the prolific foreign invader before they can sell.

Even those who are not directly affected by the superweed, but live near to a cluster, are seeing thousands taken off the value of their homes.

The destructive bamboo-like plant has been sprouting across the country in recent years and the Government estimates it would take £1.5billion to clear the infestation.

It can grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks, and easily spreads from neighbouring homes, wasteland, waterways, railway lines or footpaths.

Its extensive deep roots can penetrate roads, concrete, damage foundations and drains.

Small building societies such as Skipton and Leeds will decline mortgage applications on properties where Japanese knotweed is present.

Others such as Barclays Bank, which also owns the Woolwich, and Santander, will decline them unless work is undertaken to remove it.

While those such as Northern Rock, Clydesdale and Nationwide will consider it with guarantees or an indemnity in place, and guidance from a surveyor.

David Hollingworth, from the mortgage adviser London & Country, said: ‘Japanese knotweed is a relatively new phenomenon and valuers are more aware of it as an issue.

‘The reason why lenders are saying they won’t lend is because in extreme circumstances, it will attack the structure of the property which could have a far-reaching impact.

‘It you don’t treat it, the property could become worthless.’

Even knotweed that is close to a property or adjacent could be enough to see a purchase fall down.

Simon Wreford, is director of Japanese Knotweed Ltd, which advises homeowners, companies and councils.

‘I don’t think there is one village or town that hasn’t got knotweed, we are talking about thousands.

‘If the knotweed is within seven metres of your property, it is deemed to some degree a risk by lenders.

Banks including Northern Rock will consider giving mortgages for a blighted property is there are guarantees in place. Barclays Bank's policy is to decline these mortgages unless the weed is removed

‘We have recently seen that one or two lenders are saying no to mortgages where the property has knotweed.’

In one of the worst cases Matthew Jones and Sue Banks saw the value of their four-bedroom house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire virtually wiped out after it dropped from £305,000 to £50,000 due to the damage caused.

The weed had spread along the brick walls, forcing its way through flooring and had sprouted over skirting boards. It was on the brink of collapsing.

Knotweed was introduced into Britain by the Victorians and has the scientific name fallopia japonica.
