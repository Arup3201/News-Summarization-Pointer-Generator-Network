Foreign nurses, midwives and dentists  will be required to speak a good level of English before they are allowed to work in the NHS, the Government announced today.

The clampdown follows concerns that far too many patients are being subjected to poor care on the wards because of communication failings of staff.

Nurses from the continent will in future have to have ‘the necessary knowledge of English’ to speak to patients – and could face language tests.

Regulators will be able to strike off health workers if there are concerns that their English is not up to scratch.

Changes were made to enable doctors to be tested for their language proficiency earlier this year. It followed the scandal in 2008 when a doctor from Germany, Daniel Ubani, administered a massive overdose to a pensioner during his first shift as an out-of-hours GP.

Leading doctors have warned that the poor communication skills of some EU nurses is putting patients in danger and say their skills are not up to the same standard of British-trained colleagues.

Figures this summer showed that the number of nurses from the European Union allowed to work in Britain has doubled in just four years.

There are now 20,914 on the register who can practise in hospitals and care homes compared with 10,244 in 2010.

In a written ministerial statement today the health minister Dr Poulter paid tribute to the 'contributions that healthcare professionals from all over the world have contributed, and continue to contribute, to our NHS'.

But he said: 'It is essential that they have a sufficient knowledge of the English language in order to provide safe patient care.'

Dr Poulter said the Government had already introduced language controls for doctors and would now push for the test to apply to other professionals in the NHS.

He said: 'Earlier this year, changes were introduced to strengthen the law around language controls for doctors by introducing language controls for European Economic Area doctors wishing to practise in the UK.

'Ministers from the four UK health departments are firmly committed to improving public protection by preventing healthcare professionals who do not have sufficient knowledge of English from working in the UK.'
