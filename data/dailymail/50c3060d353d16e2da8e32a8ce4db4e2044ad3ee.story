Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez drafted tanks soldiers wielding AK-47s into the streets yesterday as he won a historic third re-election after almost 14 years in office.

The former tank commander increased security in capital Caracas amid fears violent protests might erupt at the end of a bitterly fought election campaign between him and challenger Henrique Capriles.

Both camps had warned that the other was attempting to destabalise the country, sparking allegations of underhand tactics and vote-rigging from supporters of either side.

But in the end the polling booths remained mainly peaceful as Chavez clung on to power with 54 per cent of the vote.

But despite his landmark victory, fears are growing for his ailing health which has been ravaged by cancer in recent months.

While Chavez himself insists he has beaten the deadly disease after successive bouts of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment, palace insiders have claimed it is terminal.

The decision marks the end of a bitter campaign in which the opposition 
accused him of unfairly using Venezuela's oil wealth and his near total 
control of state institutions to his advantage.

But Capriles' promises to seriously address violent crime that has spun out of control, streamline a patronage-bloated bureaucracy and end rampant corruption proved inadequate against Chavez's charisma, well-oiled political machine and a legacy of putting Venezuela's poor first with generous social welfare programs.

Chavez rallied thousands of supporters from a balcony of the presidential palace, holding up a sword that once belonged to 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar.

'The revolution has triumphed!' Chavez told the crowd, saying his supporters 'voted for socialism.'

The crowd responded chanting 'Chavez won't go!'

Chavez will now have a freer hand to push for an even bigger state role in the economy and continue populist programs.

He pledged before the vote to make a 
stronger push for socialism in the next term. He's also likely to 
further limit dissent and deepen friendships with U.S. rivals.

A Capriles victory would have brought
 a radical foreign policy shift including a halt to preferential oil 
deals with allies such as Cuba, along with a loosening of state economic
 controls and an increase in private investment.

At many polling places, voters lined up two hours before polls opened at dawn.

Capriles had united the opposition in
 a contest between two camps that distrust each other so deeply there 
are concerns whether a close election result will be respected.

The stakes could not have been higher.

Many Venezuelans were nervous about what might happen if the disputes erupt over the election's announced outcome.

'I'm
 really tired of all this polarization,' said Lissette Garcia, a 
39-year-old clothes seller and Capriles supporter who voted Sunday in 
the wealthy Caracas district of Las Mercedes. 'I want to reconnect with 
all my friends who are "Chavistas."'

Chavez's critics say the president has inflamed divisions by labeling his opponents 'fascists,' 'Yankees' and 'neo-Nazis,' while Chavez backers allege Capriles will halt generous government programs that assist the poor.

During Chavez's final rally Thursday in Caracas, he shouted to the crowd: 'We're going to give the bourgeoisie a beating!'

Violence
 flared sporadically during the campaign, including shootings and 
rock-throwing during rallies and political caravans. Two Capriles 
supporters were shot dead in the western state of Barinas last 
weekend.

Troops were dispatched across Venezuela to guard thousands of voting centers Sunday.

Chavez, who says he has emerged successfully from long treatment for cancer, held an impromptu news conference Saturday night, and when asked about the possibility of disputes over the vote, he said he expected both sides to accept the result.

'It's a mature, democratic country 
where the institutions work, where we have one of the best electoral 
systems in the world,' Chavez told reporters at the presidential palace.

But
 he also said he hoped no one would try to use the vote to play a 
'destabilizing game.' If they do, he said, 'we'll be alert to neutralize
 them.'

His opponents mounted a noisy protest in
 Caracas and other major cities on Saturday night, beating pots and pans
 from the windows of their homes to show displeasure with Chavez - and 
also their hopes for change. Drivers on downtown streets honked horns, 
joining the din.

The 40-year-old Capriles, a wiry former governor affectionately called 'Skinny' by supporters, infused the opposition with new optimism and opinion polls pointed to him giving Chavez his closest election.

Some recent polls gave Chavez a lead of about 10 percentage points, while others put the two candidates roughly even.

'Chavez is going to fight until his last breath. He doesn't know how to do anything else,' said Antonio Padron, a bank employee backing the president.

Padron expressed optimism that the 58-year-old Chavez would win, noting the leader's survival of a fight with cancer that included surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
