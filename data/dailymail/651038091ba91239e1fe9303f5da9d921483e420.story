An elderly stroke patient was left lying in her own urine in a cold ward on Christmas Day, it was claimed today. 

Elsie Keirl, 84, was admitted to Musgrove Park Hospital - which has since launched an investigation - in Taunton, Somerset, a day after she had a stroke at her home in nearby Brigwater.

Her son David Keirl, 58, stayed with her until Christmas morning before returning home for a few hours’ rest - but found on his return that his mother was ‘blue’ because her room was so cold.

'Left lying in her own urine': Elsie Keirl, 84, was admitted to hospital a day after she had a stroke at her home

Mr Keirl also claimed nurses failed to turn the pensioner for ten hours and left her lying in her own urine. The son said he was speaking out ‘because I don’t want this to happen to anyone else’.

He said: ‘She spent her last Christmas in a freezing cold room with inadequate bedding, lying in her own urine. There must be thousands of old people without anyone to fight for them.’

Mrs Keirl was initially taken to hospital by ambulance at 9pm on Christmas Eve after falling ill at her home. Mr Keirl followed close behind and stayed with her until 6am on Christmas Day.

He returned at 11am, just five hours later, when he found his mother - who also has another son - in a cold side room, with no heating and just one blanket.

Despite his repeated requests, Mrs Keirl was not moved from the room and the air conditioning system remained on, further lowering the temperature.

He claims that as a result, she had turned partially ‘blue’ and the rest of her had gone ‘white’.

Mr Keirl said: ‘She was quite settled in the medical assessment unit and they said there was nothing I could do so I went home to get a few hours’ sleep.

‘I got back at 11.30am and when I walked into the side room of the ward where she was it was absolutely freezing cold, like an ice box. Her lips were blue and her ears were white.

‘There was an air vent I think, blowing out cold air. I asked for it to be turned off and was told it couldn’t be. The radiator was cold and I was told they were on a timer and would come on later.

Probe: Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Somerset, has launched an investigation following the incident

‘There was one blanket on her, but her arms and legs and chest were sticking out and I kept asking for more blankets and kept explaining that at home she likes to be kept warm.

‘She should have been turned every two or three hours but at about 2pm to 3pm I thought, no one is turning her. When I felt in the bed it was really wet.’

After his complaints, Mrs Keirl was moved to a new room, where she is in a ‘fragile’ state.

The hospital’s chief executive, Jo Cubbon, has now spoken to Mr Keirl and his family to apologise. Its deputy chief executive, Peter Lewis, added that if the claims were true then the allegations were very serious.

A Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said that she could not comment while an investigation was under way. This probe is due to be concluded in the next few days.
