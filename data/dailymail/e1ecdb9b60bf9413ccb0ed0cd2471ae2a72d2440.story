The Archbishop of Canterbury shared tea, scones and jam with Robert Mugabe as he confronted the dictator over the persecution of Anglicans in Zimbabwe.

Dr Rowan Williams urged the tyrant to call a halt to a campaign of terror which has seen thousands of the country's Anglicans forced out of their churches and abused.

Sitting side-by-side in high-backed velvet armchairs, the pair then drank tea from fine bone china cups as they discussed politics and religion during an unprecedented 90-minute meeting at Mugabe's official residence in Harare.

REVD PETER MULLEN: Rowan Williams is allegedly in Zimbabwe to protest about the treatment of Christians by the Mugabe regime.

But, instead he delivers the oxygen of publicity by his visit.

Williams constantly reminds me of a line by the great 20thC poet C.H. Sisson, ‘In the presence of folly, I am not sanctified, but angry.’

The pair were then seen shaking hands at the end of the meeting.

The Archbishop later described the 
meeting as a ‘real exchange' of views and said the Zimbabwean leader was
 shocked by the scale of persecution of Anglicans.

He said: ‘It was a very candid meeting, disagreement was expressed clearly but I think in a peaceable manner.

‘We have asked him that he use his 
powers as head of state to guarantee the security of those of his 
citizens who worship with the Anglican church and put an end to 
unacceptable and illegal behaviour.'

Yesterday's meeting with Mugabe was the centrepiece of the Archbishop's two-day trip to Zimbabwe.

On Sunday he launched a stinging 
attack on the president's regime during a sermon in Harare, delivered to
 15,000 of the country's Anglicans.

The strongly worded rebuke sparked fears Mugabe may seek to embarrass Dr Williams by declining his request for an audience.

However the Archbishop said his comments were not even discussed when the pair met yesterday.

Instead Mugabe allowed his British 
visitor to present a dossier detailing the abuse of Zimbabwe's Anglicans
 before lecturing him on British meddling in the former colony.

Dr Williams later said the tyrant, who
 is a Catholic, claimed to have been shocked at the level of persecution
 of Anglicans in his country.

He said: ‘He expressed his concern at the damage the division was doing to communities generally in Zimbabwe.'

The Archbishop's visit was the first time for a decade that a senior British dignitary has met with Mugabe.

Some critics warned the meeting risked
 becoming a propaganda coup for the tyrant, who has become an 
international pariah after presiding over years of human rights abuses.

However Dr Williams last night said he was ‘deeply glad' he made the trip.

Some 75 per cent of Zimbabwe's 
population describe themselves as Christian, with Anglicans making up 
the largest single denomination.

Controversy: The demonstrators march against the visit by the Archbishop of Canterbury

Their mistreatment stems from a 
rupture in the Anglican Church following the 2008 sacking of Bishop 
Nolbert Kunonga by the Province of Central Africa, after he complained 
the church was too soft on homosexuals.

Anglicans obedient to his replacement,
 Bishop Chad Gandiya, say Konunga – a fervent supporter of Mugabe – has 
since been allowed to wage a campaign of intimidation against them with 
the protection of the police.

Dr Williams also spoke of the church's determination to improve conditions in Zimbabwe for Anglicans.

He added: ‘We want strongly and 
unequivocally to support the efforts of ordinary Anglicans here to 
worship in peace and to minister as they have for so many years to the 
spiritual and material needs of their communities.'

Aides to Dr Williams said his office believed his Zimbabwe trip had been a complete success.

The controversial visit was organised as part of a week-long tour of Africa in which he last week visited Malawi.

The Archbishop and his entourage are 
due to depart Harare this morning for the final leg of their trip in 
Zambia, before returning to Britain on Thursday.
