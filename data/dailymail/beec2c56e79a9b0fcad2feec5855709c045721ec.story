It may be the 'smallest room', but paying a visit here you will be privy to the grandest view in London.

From this WC in The Shard you can marvel at landmarks including the Tower of London and HMS Belfast as you gaze across the River Thames.

It is on the 68th floor of the £2billion development, 800ft up the 1,016ft high skyscraper, western Europe's tallest, which opens to visitors next month.

Room with a view: This toilet on the 68th floor of The Shard, Europe's tallest building, will be available for public use when The View visitor centre opens next month

Dominant: The £2billion skyscraper towers over London Bridge Station and dwarfs some of the capital's most historic and iconic landmarks, including Tower Bridge

Dizzying: The eye-catching 30 St Mary Axe, better known as The Gherkin, in the financial district is one of the many landmarks which can spotted from 300ft-high toilet

Popular peak: The View's opening day on February 1 has sold out as is the second day, despite tickets for the centre costing £24.95 for adults and £18.95 for children

Most people, however, will be enjoying the spectacular 40-mile views from the official viewing areas.

The opening day for the attraction, known as The View from the Shard, February 1 is sold out as is the second day, despite tickets costing up to £24.95 for adults and £18.95 for children.

In the viewing areas visitors will be able to look through special telescopes known as Tell: scopes. These are particularly useful if visibility is poor as they show not only a live 'as it is' image but, at the push of a button, what a clear-day view would be as well as a sunset view and a night view.

Those using the telescopes will, by focusing on a particular landmark, receive audible information about it.

Looming: The Shard casts a long shadow across the Thames and the City of London, but its is nothing compared to the 40 miles view visitors will be able to enjoy

Tourist attraction: Andy Nyberg, chief executive of The Shard, said The View will be a 'natural starting point for exploring' London thanks to its spectacular vantage points

Home sweet home: The building also features exclusive super prime residential apartments on its top levels which boast 360 degree views of London

Getting your eye in: The London Eye is one of numerous London landmarks that visitors will be able to view through special telescopes and hear information about

Don't look down: These workmen - seen from the open-air viewing gallery on Level 72 - prove they have a head for heights as they scale the mammoth structure

Bird's eye view: The public will get a fresh perspective on the hustle and bustle of London life as they watch commuters rush to and from work from up on high

Part of the furniture: Thanks to its gigantic height, The Shard has already become one of the capital most recognisable buildings alongside Tower Bridge and the GLA

Worth it for the view: Steep entry prices are not expected to deter visitors from flocking to The Shard to see the capital like they have never seen it before

Something for everyone: The glassy triangular-shaped Shard is home to 600sq ft of officers, three floors of restaurants and a 200-room Shangri La Hotel

The View from the Shard chief executive 
Andy Nyberg said: 'This is the only place you can see the whole of 
London at once and, as such, is a natural starting point for exploring 
the UK's capital.'

Comment from spokesman about the 'loo with a view': 'The main toilets for The View from The Shard are located on level 1 of the attraction.

'A limited number of these 'loos with a view' are available on Level 68 for those that need them, however they are not normally open for general use.'

Plenty to see: St Paul's Cathedral and the BT Tower are just some of the world-famous London landmarks that can been seen on clear day from The Shard

Quick ascent: The open-air public viewing platform towards the top of the 1,1013ft building is accessible by high-speed elevators

Breathtaking: The viewing platform at the enormous skyscraper offers this incredible view of the 17th Century St Paul's Cathedral, the West End and further afield

Organisers say there should not be queues, but to amuse those waiting to go through security, special, cheeky, murals have been created.

Showing 140 famous Londoners in playful juxtapositions, the murals depict the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as a Pearly King and Queen, London Mayor Boris Johnson shining the shoes of a top-hatted former mayor Ken Livingstone and the Queen - with corgi - riding on a scooter.

The Shard is part of a £2 billion redevelopment of the London Bridge area. The glassy, triangular-shaped Shard has 600,000sq ft of offices, three floors of restaurants and a 200-room Shangri-La hotel which is due to open this summer.

There are also 10 luxury apartments which are expected to go for as much as £50 million each and which are expected to be let out.

The only way is up: Visitors will see there is still plenty more building above them when they look directly upwards from the open-air viewing platform

Informative: There will be plenty of interactive information to take in about The Shard and London's other iconic buildings in 10 languages at The View visitor centre

Great views: In the viewing areas there are special 
telescopes known as Tell: scopes, which will be particularly useful when 
visibility is poor due to the weather

Glowing: The early morning sun lights up one of the country's most striking architectural gems to enhance the picturesque urban view from high up in The Shard

Aerial view: Rail passengers will get the perfect vantage point to see if their service is running on time - but it is a long way to the platform from the 68th floor

Leading the way: Interactive displays show visitors the way to The View once they are inside the colossal building - with the centre standing 800 ft up the 1,016ft Shard

Sale: Plenty of merchandise will be up for grabs at The View's shop, including books, mugs and cuddly toys to help visitors remember the experience for years to come

On the way up: Display screens at the entrance to The View at The Shard displays ticket prices and the times that entrance is available throughout the day

Optimistic: Organisers say there should not be queues when the attraction opens next month but to amuse those waiting to go through security have created murals
