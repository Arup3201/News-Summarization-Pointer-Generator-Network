One in four homeowners say they will be in financial trouble when interest rates rise, according to research.

A study found seven per cent believed they would be in ‘serious difficulties’ if their mortgage repayments increased, while 20 per cent would be in ‘slight’ financial trouble.

The report, published by the Building Societies Association and the Money Advice Trust, also found that a fifth will be forced to cut back on essentials like clothing and food, while two-fifths will spend less on holidays and eating out.

The study found 12 per cent will have to work longer hours to keep up with repayments and six per cent will have to move to a cheaper property.

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has signalled that the base rate, frozen at a historic low of 0.5 per cent since 2009, could be ‘beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually’.

While the Bank says any rise would be ‘gradual and limited’, research shows that many who took out their loans when interest rates were low may struggle to meet higher monthly repayments.

Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ‘After all these years, mortgage-payers are in for a big financial shock when interest rates begin to rise.

‘For many, that shock will be too much to absorb – and there is a real risk that we will see a surge in unmanageable debt problems as a result.

‘Our message to borrowers is clear – interest rates will rise and that day is coming soon, so now is the time to prepare.

‘Draw up a budget, speak to your lender, and if you do find yourself struggling to repay, seek free debt advice as early as possible.’

The YouGov poll surveyed more than 2,000 mortgage borrowers.

Paul Broadhead, head of mortgage policy at the Building Societies Association, warned that ‘many consumers are only used to a low rate environment’.

He said: ‘These results indicate the sensitivity of people’s monthly spending to changes in general household expenditure, indicating that as mortgage rates rise this could have a significant impact on economic recovery.

‘Whilst most mortgage rates are not linked quite so directly to the base rate as they used to be, rates will rise as it increases.’

While some homeowners said they planned to work more hours to earn extra money if rates rose, Mr Broadhead said this ‘may not be within their control’.

He added: ‘Our advice to those concerned about interest rate rises is to start thinking about how they will manage the increased costs.’

This month, two members of the Bank’s rate-setting committee voted for a second time in favour of a base rate rise.

Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty said the Bank needed to act now in order to pre-empt wage and inflationary pressures ahead, but were out-voted by the other seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee.

It is thought the Bank will wait until it sees stronger signs of wage growth before increasing the rate.

The pay rise for the average worker increased by just 0.7 per cent over the last year, less than half the current rate of inflation at 1.5 per cent.

Tory MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee in the Commons, recently suggested a premature rise in interest rates would be a catastrophe for millions of families.

He said: ‘There is definitely a feeling now that interest rates will start to rise. When the day comes there will be households holed below the water line, and they will be in trouble.

‘The problem is that there is a huge amount of household debt in the country. People have forgotten that 0.5 per cent is an emergency level of interest rates. It is not normal at all.

‘If you are a saver, rising interest rates are fantastic. If you are a borrower it is bad news and for those that are already struggling, or close to struggling, raising interest rates will be a catastrophe.’

With rates tipped to rise, some homeowners might find it's worth paying the charge to leave a mortgage deal early in order to lock in to low interest offers for the longer term.

There are some decent five or even six year fixes currently available, which will enable you to make the most of manageable rates, despite the predicted hikes. In many cases the difference in repayment costs will balance fabourably against the fees charged by your old lender.
