When police got a call about a bomb in the middle of a road, they swung into action.

Officers cordoned off the road where the device – with a red cylinder, batteries and what looked like Semtex – had been spotted and advised residents to stay indoors.

They also diverted pupils who were leaving a nearby school and called for specialist back-up.

All very well – until, embarrassingly for the police, it emerged that the bomb scare was of their own making.

The bomb that was found laying in Peny-Pound-Road Gwent, it had been dropped by the bomb squad by mistake following an excersice at a council property called The Hill

The
device was, in fact, a dummy bomb that had fallen off the back of a 
trailer while being used in a training exercise by specialist search 
officers earlier the same day.

Yesterday supermarket cashier Dean Cheal, 27, who discovered the device, said it looked like ‘something from a James Bond film’.

He added: ‘It’s a bit naughty of the police to be dropping something like that in the middle of the road without realising.

‘I was really shocked when I saw it – it’s not something you see every day.

'There was a red cylinder with wires hanging out of it and what looked like playdough, which I thought was Semtex, with a metal pipe and two batteries attached.

‘I ran up the road because I  thought it looked dodgy. People were scared because we didn’t know what it was.’

The drama unfolded shortly after 2pm on Thursday when Mr Cheal spotted the device in Pen-y-Pound Road, Abergavenny, while cycling home from work.

He called police who sent an officer in a patrol car to examine it. ‘He wasn’t sure and said it could be somebody playing a prank,’ Mr Cheal said.

‘But he closed off the road and radioed for his sergeant, who also came to check it out.’

The officers then cordoned off the road with tape and told Mr Cheal the ‘bomb squad were coming’.

Pupils
at King Henry VIII comprehensive school were stopped from leaving by 
the main entrance and residents of a housing estate were told to stay 
indoors.

‘By then it was getting busier because the kids were leaving school,’ Mr Cheal added.

‘They were diverted across playing fields and the school buses were diverted away from the road.

‘But
when some more police arrived in a riot van they just laughed it off. 
One of the officers went along and picked it up, ripped the police tape 
down and said it was a dummy bomb.’

Builder Gareth Evans, 30, said: ‘It 
looked exactly like a real bomb you see on the television. I don’t think
anyone could have told at first glance that it was a fake.’

A spokesman for Gwent Police apologised for the blunder.

‘It quickly transpired that the object was a fake device used in a training exercise that was being undertaken by search officers close by,’ she said.

‘There have been lessons learnt as a result of this exercise and we apologise if residents were inconvenienced by the cordon that was in place for just over 30 minutes.’
