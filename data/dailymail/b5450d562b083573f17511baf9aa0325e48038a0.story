It looks more like the kind of 'amusing' poster a university student might have up on their wall.

But these explicit toiletry lessons have actually been posted on cubicle doors at Sydney's Macquarie University after cleaners complained overseas students were not aware of Western WC procedures.

Just to make sure that those whose English might not be up to it, the diagrams make it clear on how to behave when nature calls.

Not very PC guide to the WC: Sydney's Macquarie University has stuck the posters in the bathrooms to show the conventional Western fashion for using them

The lessons include descriptions not to stand on the toilet seat or sit on the floor whilst answering a call of duty.

And there are explicit instructions for the ladies on how to dispose of personal effects - not down the bowl but in a waste bin.

Others inform the toilet unaware that the seat cover must be lowered after use and hands must be washed.

A spokesman for Macquarie University said: 'We received a complaint from our cleaning contractors about the state of some toilets.

'They believed that some students may have been squatting above the toilet rather than using them in a conventional Western fashion.'

Solution: Since the posters have gone up at the Macquarie University, pictured, the problems have apparently stopped

The spokesman told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that the cleaning company was concerned about cleanliness.

'We put those posters around the campus in collaboration with the international students' group and got advice on what information should be contained,' he said.

Since the posters have gone up, the problems have apparently stopped.

It comes after MP Teresa Gambaro said this week that migrants should be taught to use deodorant and wait in line.

She was later forced to make an embarrassing apology when her comments sparked outrage.
