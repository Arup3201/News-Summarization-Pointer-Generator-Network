President Barack Obama put a brave face on his disastrous debate performance on Sunday night by joking with an audience of celebrity backers that he can't 'perform flawlessly every time'.

Speaking at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, the president took a good-natured shot at his underwhelming debate performance, marveling at how his friends in the entertainment business could turn in perfect showings every time.

'I can't always say the same,' Obama told thousands of supporters, who got the joke right away. It was Obama's most direct acknowledgment yet that his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, won their debate on Wednesday as a tight race rolled into its last month.

Obama spoke at the start of two-day fundraising swing through California, his final one out West of this election, and one that was expected to raise several millions dollars for advertising efforts to the finish.Â 

He appeared on stage after comments by actor George Clooney and performances by Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi and Jennifer Hudson - and before a night-capping dinner for 150 guests at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant at $25,000 per person.

Thanks for coming: The president told supporters at the Nokia Theatre that he had bad days and made mistakes in the 2008 campaign too

The president told about 6,000 
supporters at the Nokia Theatre that he had bad days and made mistakes 
in the 2008 campaign, too, but nobody remembers that because he won.

'We goofed up. I goofed up,' he said of 2008. 'But the American people carried us forward.'

He then moved onto late-night soiree 
at Puck's WP24 restaurant, which was expected to rake in $3.75 million. 
Former President Bill Clinton joined Obama earlier Sunday for a more 
intimate gathering with elite, longtime donors at the home of 
entertainment mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.

The
Republican presidential nominee, meanwhile, sought to build on the 
momentum from a debate performance last week that even Democrats 
conceded was 'masterful.'

Campaigning in up-for-grabs Florida, 
Romney told a crowd of about 12,000 in Port St. Lucie that he had 
enjoyed himself, ticking off a list of Obama shortcomings he said he had
exposed during the first debate.

'Now
of course, days later, we're hearing his excuses,' Romney said. 'And 
next January we'll be watching him leave the White House for the last 
time.'

Romney ended his
day in Virginia, where on Monday he planned a major foreign policy 
address in which he will criticize Obama's handling of unrest in Libya 
and elsewhere.

Obama 
campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki, dismissing what she called Romney's
fourth or fifth attempt to explain his global intentions, said the bar 
is high for Romney to convince voters he's prepared to be commander in 
chief.

Debate disaster for Obama: Even Democrats conceded that Romney's performance in the first debate was 'masterful'

'We are not going to be lectured by someone who's been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he sticks his toe in the foreign policy waters,' Psaki said aboard Air Force One as Obama made his way to California.

Even as Romney sought to reap further rewards from his debate performance, a string of good news for the president threatened to steal the former Massachusetts governor's spotlight.

A jobs report Friday showing 
unemployment at the lowest levels of Obama's presidency was quickly 
followed Saturday by a fundraising report showing Obama and Democrats 
had raised $181 million in September.

It
was their best fundraising month of the campaign, but fell short of 
their record $190 million raised in September 2008 as the president 
campaigned for his first term.

Romney's campaign has not released its report for the month, and Republicans sought to downplay Obama's financial advantage.

The party's national chairman, Reince Priebus, said he had been counting all along on being outraised by Obama and Democrats.

'This isn't going to come down to money. This is going to come down to heart,' Priebus said. 'We'll beat them on the ground, and we'll have all the money we need to be competitive.'

After trailing Romney in the money race for most of the summer, Obama is back on top and pulling out all the stops to keep it that way. In what will be his final fundraising trip out West this election, Obama is enlisting his celebrity pals - from actors to singers to chefs - to donate to his campaign and encourage their fans to do the same.
