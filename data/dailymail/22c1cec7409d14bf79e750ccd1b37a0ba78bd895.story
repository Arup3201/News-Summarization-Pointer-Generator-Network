It was a fine example of old-fashioned community spirit.

But a group of volunteers who got together to rebuild a road fell foul of penpushers – who accused them of health and safety breaches and even trespassing.

Residents of Niton on the Isle of Wight had been campaigning for action ever since homes were left cut off by a landslide in February.

Destruction: Undercliff Drive was closed in February after a landslide wrecked the road's surface

It turned their road into a pile of rubble, and families were forced to find temporary accommodation. 

Eight months later nothing had been done, and with eight displaced families still desperate to get back to their homes, a group of ‘guerrilla’ volunteers from across the island decided to take matters into their own hands.

Their two-day repair operation involved clearing and filling in a 40ft section of Undercliff Drive, spending £2,500 on materials. It comes after a similar scheme was hatched by Mike Watts, who built his own toll road.

He spent £150,000 on the 400-yard track through a field, as the A431 between Bath and Bristol was fixed after a landslip. His local council urged drivers not to use the road, citing health and safety concerns – but they ignored the advice and more than 100,000 have now used it.

The Undercliff Drive volunteers don’t charge other motorists who use their revamped stretch. But their activities have not impressed Island Roads, a firm which maintains highways on behalf of the local authority. 

It claimed the work is unsafe, while the council said those responsible may face penalties for trespassing.

But resident Gary Smedmore, who owns a caravan park, said: ‘A team of builders put the plan together. It’s not a haphazard thing.

'We can now get an ambulance down there and residents have access. It is a demonstration of people power.’

Isle of Wight Council last month set aside £500,000 for repairs, but did not say when work would start.

A joint statement from Island Roads and the council said that until the safety of the road could be verified, vehicles should not use it.
