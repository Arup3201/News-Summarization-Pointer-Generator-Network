Singer Samantha Jade has been mocked on social media for her role in an advertising campaign for Australian supermarket chain Woolworths.

The X Factor winner appears in the commercials which debuted on Sunday night during the Australian Open as the face of the supermarket's catchy 'Cheap Cheap' jingle.

One of the ads was filmed on court at this year's tennis and features with 50 ball kids, where Jade can be seen dancing and singing while encouraging others to do the 'Cheap Cheap Dance' and share their moves with the hashtag.

But viewers were quick to respond to the 'cringeworthy' ads, slamming the singer on social media calling her 'cheap' and threatening to boycott Woolworths to shop at their major competitor Coles. 

'That Woolworths ad with Samantha and singing birds just made my hair bleed', wrote one Twitter user. 

Social media lit up with criticism over the ads which aired on Sunday evening 

Users were not impressed with the jingle - which is known for its incredibly catchy tune 

Some questioned how good the move would be for her career

Samantha Jade revealed ahead of the release of the commercials she chose to pair with Woolworths after growing up shopping at the chain.

'I've always been a Woolies kid. I lived next door to a Woolworths store in my hometown Morley in Perth where I shopped with my mum for family meals and get togethers', the singer said.

'Spending time with family and friends is really important to me. I now live in Sydney and I still shop at my local Woolies to get supplies for a girly picnic or family BBQ', Jade added.

Commenters took to the Woolworths Facebook page to express their feelings 

Some vowed not to shop at the supermarket chain 

Others criticised Jade claiming she had 'cheapened herself'

One person even came up with an alternative way to spend advertising money

However many vocal social media users have criticised it calling it a 'cheap' move by the X Factor star

The collaboration is part of the supermarket's commitment to supporting young talent, according to Woolworths General Manager of Marketing Tony Phillips.

'We're delighted to be working with Samantha Jade, one of the most exciting musicians of today. Over the next few months, Samantha will appear on our TV screens and you'll also hear her fabulous voice in store,' Mr Phillips said.

'We're sure Australians will love her just as much as they love our 'Cheap Cheap' prices', he added. 

However when the video was uploaded to the Woolworths Facebook page, that also opened up a space for many more people to show their dislike for the commercial.

Despite the criticisms fans still jumped to Jade's defence praising her singing talents

Others vowed only to shop at Woolworths

Some hit out at the company for the 'terrible advert'

Others said they cringed while watching it 

'I'm sorry Samantha Jade but you've cheap cheap cheapened yourself!', one woman commented.

'Totally turned me off buying anything at Woolworths,' another wrote.

Despite the criticism Jade still has many supporters out there saying the commercial encourage them to continue their commitment to the supermarket chain and the Australian singer.

'Woah Coles just got owned by Woolworths in ad dept! Samantha Jade can definitely sing!' read one tweet.

'Makes me want to shop at Woolworths every day', another social media user posted.  

Speaking about the campaign on Monday, Samantha Jade said in her experience the response had been 'overwhelmingly positive'.

'There are always going to be critics, it comes with the territory,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'The vast majority of the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and I've been so pleased by the interest and support I've received from my fans and Woolies shoppers.' 

'On the whole, we've been really pleased with the positive public reaction to the announcement,' Woolworths said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia.

'People love Samantha, it's a really fun partnership and we are delighted to be showcasing fresh Australian talent.'
