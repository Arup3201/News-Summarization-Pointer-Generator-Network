Leon Britton has signed a new one-year extension to his contract at Swansea City to potentially prolong his association with the club to a 15th year.

The central midfielder has been synonymous with the Swans' rise through the divisions and remains at the heartbeat of Garry Monk's side.

Britton, 31, is likely to surpass 500 appearances for the club. The decision to stay on at the Liberty Stadium wasn't exactly a tricky one.

Done: Leon Britton has signed a one-year contract extension to his deal at Swansea City

Moving on up: The central midfielder has played in every division plus the Europa League for the club

'To stay on at the club for an extra year on top of my current contract is something that I am delighted to do,' he said.

'From a personal point of view, the contract talks these days are so easy. I just wanted to get it done.

'To get to 500 appearances in all competitions would be a great achievement for me. That's my next personal target.

'But the important thing is that I help the club stay in the Premier League. We have had three years in the Premier League and I'd be delighted if we are still in it at the end of my new contract.'

Task: Boss Garry Monk will try and keep the club in the Premier League for a fourth consecutive season
