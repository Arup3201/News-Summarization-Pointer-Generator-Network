Newcastle United continued their successful tour Down Under with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Wellington Phoenix at the Westpac Stadium.

Yoan Gouffran's 42nd-minute header was enough to separate the sides during a physical match which saw Alan Pardew's men suffer four injuries.

New signing Siem de Jong was passed fit to play but was taken off as a precaution after 31 minutes, while captain Fabricio Coloccini also left the field grimacing.

Concern: Siem de Jong (right) was one of four Newcastle players forced to leave the pitch through injury

WELLINGTON PHOENIX: Moss, Muscat, Gorrin (Boxall 76), Burns (Cunningham 71), Brockie (Ryfer 85), Boyd (Hicks 71), Riera, Fenton, Sigmund, Durante, Doyle. 

NEWCASTLE UNITED: Elliot, Yanga-Mbiwa (Satka 65), Coloccini (Vuckic 78), S Taylor, Haidara (Dummett 76), Anita, Colback, Abeid (Aarons 46), Gouffran (Campbell 85), De Jong (Perez 31), Riviere (Armstrong 65).

Subs not used: Alnwick, Woodman.

Goal: Gouffran (42).

Bookings: Yanga-Mbiwa (50). 

ATTENDANCE: 30,060.

The Magpies also lost Mehdi Abeid and Rolando Aarons to injury as Wellington continued to put in strong challenges throughout the game. 

But Pardew will be relatively pleased overall with his side's display as they overcame an industrious Phoenix side who were let down by their poor finishing in front of goal.

Gouffran's header was somewhat fortuitous - he opportunistically capitalised on a mistake from Phoenix goalkeeper Glen Moss, who ran past Vurnon Anita's cross, allowing his French team-mate to nod into the net.

And the Wellington outfit had beaten West Ham 2-1 earlier in the week and the Magpies were troubled at times by their hard-working side. 

Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot was also forced to make two fabulous saves after half-time as the Magpies struggled at times to adapt to their manager's experimental 3-5-2 system.

Emmanuel Riviere again looked bright but he failed to find the net, his best chance being a tame effort straight at the Phoenix goalkeeper, and both Gouffran and De Jong came close to adding more goals for Newcastle.

During an emotional match, tributes were paid to the two Newcastle fans who died during the MH17 Malaysia Airlines disaster.

More than 2,000 Magpies fans were in the Wellington Stadium and they led a minute's applause on 28 minutes for Liam Sweeney and on 63 minutes for John Alder.

A minute's silence before the game was also served impeccably, with Newcastle players wearing special t-shirts commemorating the pair and West Ham United stars also paying their respects. 

Newcastle finished the game with 10 men when Aarons, who had replaced the injured Abeid at half-time, limped off with three minutes to go with only substitute goalkeepers Jak Alnwick and Freddie Woodman left on the Newcastle bench.
