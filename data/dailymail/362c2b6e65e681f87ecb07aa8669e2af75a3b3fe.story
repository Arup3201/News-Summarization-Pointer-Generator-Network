'Sadistic': Kindergarten teacher Frederick Mena, 25, is accused of digging his nails into a young student's skin in class because he wanted to see her cry  

A kindergarten teacher from Miami has been charged with aggravated child abuse after police say he dug his nails into a girl's hand and leg just to see her cry.

Frederick Mena, 25, was arrested earlier this month in connection to the sickening incident that allegedly took place March 5 at Silver Bluff Elementary School in Coconut Grove.

According to an arrest report, Mena was teaching math to a kindergarten class when the victim, a young girl, became stymied by the material.

In his frustration, according to the Miami Dade School Police, Mena dug his fingernails deeply into the child's hand and calf, breaking the skin and leaving marks.

The reports states that Mena later admitted to the incident in a letter penned to the principal of the school.

According to the 25-year-old's written confession, cited by NBC Miami, he injured his student because ‘for some reason,’ he had the urge to see her cry.

He reportedly wrote that instead of resisting that violent urge, he decided to 'go with it.'

Mena added that the child in question was too ‘sensitive,’ and he thought that inflicting pain on her might ‘toughen’ her up.

But in the end, he admitted that he hurt her to ‘plainly satisfy an ugly pleasure.’

Once the deed was done, the 25-year-old educator said he felt no emotion and no regret, reported WSVN.

‘Knowing myself and who I truly am deep down I’m just shocked thinking that I actually did this!’ he reportedly stated, according to Miami Herald. 

When questioned by police, Mena allegedly admitted that he wanted to take advantage of the kindergartner while she was at her lowest, and that he desired to 'punish her' and 'put her down further.'

The Miami-Dade School District released a statement saying that Mena has been removed from the classroom, terminated and banned from ever working for the district again.
