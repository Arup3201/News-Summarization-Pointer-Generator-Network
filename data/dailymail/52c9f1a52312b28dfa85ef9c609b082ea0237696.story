Michael Jackson’s ex-wife Debbie Rowe broke down in tears while testifying in his wrongful death trial on Wednesday.

Rowe took the stand as a witness as part of the negligence lawsuit filed by Jackson’s mother against concert promoters AEG Live LLC.

The 54-year-old was crying as she described the late pop star’s fear of pain and trust of physicians during her testimony.

Emotional: The 54-year-old broke down in tears as she described Jacko's 'incredible fear of pain'

‘Michael had a very low pain tolerance and his fear of pain was incredible,’ Rowe said. ‘I think the doctors took advantage of him that way.’

Rowe described how Jackson trusted doctors to prescribe pain medication to him, but felt his longtime dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein and plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Hoefflin sometimes tried to outdo each other while losing sight of Jackson's care.

‘These idiots were going back and forth the whole time, not caring about him,’ Rowe told jurors.

The mother of Jackson’s eldest two children, Prince and Paris, added that the one doctor she did trust was Allan Metzger, and she told him she was concerned that Klein and Hoefflin were giving the singer too many medications.

‘The only physician who ever did anything, the only physician who cared for Michael was Allan Metzger,’ Rowe said, fighting back tears.

A phone message left at Klein's office was not immediately returned.

An email sent to Hoefflin's former practice was returned, stating the plastic surgeon retired five years ago and no longer practiced medicine.

Katherine Jackson sat in the front row of the courtroom and leaned forward in her seat during portions of Rowe's testimony.

Lawsuit: Jackson's mother Katherine is claiming AEG Live failed to properly investigate Dr. Conrad Murray

The mother of the late singer claims in her lawsuit that AEG Live failed to properly investigate the doctor later convicted of giving her son an overdose of the anaesthetic propofol in 2009 which caused his death on June 25 of that year aged 50.

Marvin S. Putnam, the company's lead defense attorney, said in opening statements that the case was about Jackson's personal choices and his desire to use propofol as a sleep aid.

Rowe described her first meeting with Jackson in the early 1980s, when he came into Klein's office for treatment of acne.

She said Klein often met with 
celebrity patients on weekends and after-hours so they could avoid 
scrutiny, and in her first meeting with Jackson she asked him to come 
into the office for future visits at a more convenient time.

'That's when our friendship started,' she said.

Rowe
said she would frequently talk to Jackson on the phone and eventually 
started to accompany him to his treatments with Hoefflin.

She
added that the plastic surgeon would give Jackson Propofol during 
procedures and the singer would be unconscious for several hours.
