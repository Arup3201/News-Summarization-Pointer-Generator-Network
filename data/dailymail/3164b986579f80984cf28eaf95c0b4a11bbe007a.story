A fraternity and sorority at the University of Connecticut have been suspended after a sophomore girl ended up in the hospital after being hazed in an incident inspired by the film Dazed and Confused.

Kappa Kappa Gamma member Hillary Holt says she went to a party with her sorority at fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon's off-campus house last week where she was forced to drink beer, wine and shots until she blacked out.  

Following the incident, both houses have been placed on probation as both the school and local police investigate. The hazing report also factored into the historic decision by Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national officials to ban pledging at all chapters.

Hazed: University of Connecticut sophomore and Kappa Kappa Gamma member Hillary Holt says she was force-fed alcohol and ordered to 'sizzle like bacon' at a recent fraternity party

In an interview with WFSB, Holt describes the dangerous scene at last Thursday's party.

She says brothers and sisters held drinks to their mouths and forced them to drink the liquor.

At one point she and others were ordered to lie on the floor and pretend to 'sizzle like bacon', imitating a scene from the film Dazed and Confused.

In the film, a group of high school senior women haze the incoming freshmen girls by making them lie on the ground and roll around while they yell: 'Fry like bacon you little piggies!'

Original: Holt says she and other members were ordered to 'sizzle like bacon', imitating a scene from the film Dazed and Confused where character Simone (played by Joey Lauren Adams) hazes a group of incoming high school freshmen

Inspiration: In the 1993 film, the freshmen girls are ordered to lie on the cement and wiggle while Simone yells: 'Fry like bacon you piggies!'

Holt said she drank so much she blacked out and woke up in the hospital where she was told her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the limit of 0.08.

'You have seven to nine people yelling at you, girls and guys, and if you don't do what they tell you to, the consequences could get worse,' Holt said.

In a letter to the organizations, the school said the interim suspension is not meant to be punitive, but part of the investigative process and used 'when information indicates that the presence of your organization on campus could pose a threat to the health and safety of the campus community.'

The local Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity declined to comment and referred all inquiries to their national offices. The Kappa Kappa Gamma house even put up a 'No Trespassing' sign at the end of their driveway.

Kappa Kappa Gamma's national office issued a statement saying it was working with the university on the investigation and does not tolerate hazing.

Brandon Weghorst, a national spokesman for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the fraternity sent a letter to the UConn chapter ordering it to halt all operations while it conducts its own investigation.

'SAE offers its apologies to Miss Holt for any hazing or ordeal that she may have been subjected to, especially in a Sigma Alpha Epsilon house,' he said. 'And we apologize if any of our members were responsible for those actions. They are not consistent with our expectations.'

Weghorst noted that the national fraternity last week changed its structure to eliminate the pledging process in an effort to 'address some of these issues'. Pledging is the process of becoming a new member of a Greek organization and the process can often involve doing dangerous or embarrassing tasks in fraternity recruitment.

According to a recent report in Bloomberg, SAE is the deadliest U.S. fraternity.

It's not the first time the fraternity has faced sanctions at UConn. SAE was placed on probation in 2004 after the alleged theft of some snacks from a local convenience store. It was given a warning in 2007 for damage caused to a university meeting room.

And in 2010, the fraternity was again placed on probation after it was determined that several members riding on its homecoming float were intoxicated and one of them had urinated on another organization's float.
