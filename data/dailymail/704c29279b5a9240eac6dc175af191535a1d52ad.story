Justin Bieber was announced today the new underwear model for Calvin Klein. 

The 20-year-old pop star's new role had many teenagers swooning, but most women were  underwhelmed by the news, with one commenting on Twitter, 'that's an anti-marketing strategy'.

But from Mark Wahlberg to Jamie Dornan, the Baby singer is just the latest in a long line of muscle-bound hunks to pull on Calvin's clinging briefs - we examine how he matches up.

Justin Bieber joins  an elite group of actors, models and sportsmen who've modelled Calvin Klein underwear

Certainly the teen sensation has divided opinion, with one woman on Twitter writing, 'I just lost all respect for Calvin Klein when you put that idiot on their ads. Ughh so annoying'.

Justin looked predictably smug in the black and white images, staring into the camera with what has become his trademark furrowed brow. 

And who can blame him? By signing up to the campaign, Justin has joined the ranks of an elite group of male actors, models and sportsmen who have filled Calvin Klein's white cotton smalls.  

From Mark Wahlberg, who took the campaign global in 1992 to Twilight's Kellan Lutz, there has always been a stir around the designer's underwear campaigns.

While before finding fame in The Fall and Fifty Shades Of Grey, Jamie Dornan also tried his hand at posing in the buff while looking moodily into the distance.

So does Justin Bieber really live up to his predecessors' legacy? Or did Mr Klein drop the ball (no pun intended) on this one?

FEMAIL has dug out the finest male Calvin Klein underwear ads of all time. We'll let you decide whether Justin's posing is perfect or a bit pants...

Although the adverts have done wonders for the careers of several men, there are mixed emotions from the stars about their involvement in the campaigns. 

Mark Wahlberg once said of his shoot with Kate Moss: 'The underwear modelling I did for Calvin Klein with Kate Moss was not good in retrospect, but at the time it got me a lot of attention from the ladies.

'Explaining that – along with the rap career – to my kids is going to be embarrassing when they are old enough to ask.'

Meanwhile, Jamie Dornan, who is soon to become a global film star when Fifty Shades Of Grey is released, says underwear modelling was a sound financial decision.

He said: 'I got lucky with that gig because quite early on I could be picky about what I did, where I did it. 

'And because I was on contracts, I was working maybe 10 days a year and getting paid really well for it.'
