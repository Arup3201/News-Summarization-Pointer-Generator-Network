Accused: Emmanuel Okubote, 22, (pictured) allegedly took  pregnant Colette Brown and her boyfriend Tabare Garcia hostage after his cannabis factory in Thamesmead, south east London was burgled

A thug wearing an electronic tag kidnapped a pregnant woman and her boyfriend, throttled her until she passed out and punched her in the stomach in a row over a £40,000 cannabis theft, a court heard today.

Emmanuel Okubote is accused of taking six-and-a-half months pregnant Colette Brown and her boyfriend Tabare Garcia hostage after his cannabis factory in Thamesmead, south east London was burgled.  

The Old Bailey was told Okubote and his accomplice, Shane De Silva, had accused Mr Garcia of involvement in the theft, ordering the couple into cars before subjecting them to the terrifying ordeal.

The jury was told told Okubote had grabbed Miss Brown around her neck and choked her until she passed out after telling her she was going to die.

Okubote, 22, also allegedly held a gun to the neck of Mr Garcia and burned him with a lighter while demanding he hand over £40,000, claiming the father-to-be had stolen from him.

Okubote, known by the street name ‘Sylar’, eventually released Miss Brown before going home at 9pm to comply with the conditions of his electronic tag, while his associates kept Mr Garcia prisoner, the jury heard.

He then returned to issue more threats to Mr Garcia the following morning, refusing to release him until he was given the money, it is claimed.

The hostage was released a few hours later when an armed police officer found him being held prisoner in a car by Okubote’s accomplice Shane De Silva, jurors were told.

De Silva has admitted his involvement in the kidnapping, while Okubote denies the charges and is now standing trial.

John Causer, prosecuting, told the court that the dispute centred around a flat in Thamesmead.

Miss Brown, whose baby has since been born, had moved out of the property in late 2013 after falling pregnant, and De Silva had offered to redecorate it for free.

But over the next three months it was turned into a ‘hydroponics factory’ growing cannabis using specialised equipment, it is claimed.

On 15 March this year police were called to the flat after a neighbour spotted a ladder leaning next to a window, but it had already been cleaned out.

That evening, Okubote contacted De Silva and arrangements were made to meet Miss Brown in Sydenham, the court heard.

Mr Causer said: ‘It had become known the cannabis was taken and efforts were made to find out why.’

Okubote allegedly ordered Miss Brown into his silver VW Golf and drove her to a property in Catford, before demanding she hand over her phone.

De Silva then called Mr Garcia and told him that ‘stuff had gone missing’, before picking him up from his mother’s house.

Mr Causer told jurors: ‘You will have to assess how much Mr Garcia did or didn’t know about what was going on. He says he knew what was being talked about but himself had nothing to do with it.’

The prosecutor said that De Silva, who was armed with a gun, punched Mr Garcia several times and demanded: ‘Where’s the weed and the money?’

Dispute: The dispute centred on a flat in this block in Thamesmead, south east London. The court was told it had been turned into a cannabis factory, which was later burgled

While De Silva and Mr Garcia were driving to Catford, Okubote told Miss Brown that her boyfriend had stolen from him, and she was going to die.

‘He said he didn’t care that she was six-and-a-half months pregnant,’ said Mr Causer.

‘He twice throttled her, telling her she was going to die and “Why don’t you die?”

‘The second time she passed out from the effects of what he did to her and when she came round he twice punched her in the stomach knowing she was pregnant.’

Miss Brown then heard another car arrive and the sound of Mr Garcia screaming in pain, the court heard.

Okubote got out and went over to Mr Garcia to tell him: ‘I have just run into your girlfriend. I know 100 per cent it was you and I will kill you.’

He held a gun to Mr Garcia’s neck and burned him with a lighter before pistol-whipping him, the court heard.

Mr Causer said: ‘Okubote was demanding £40,000 from Tabare Garcia and making threats to him, saying “I am a sick b****** I will burn you from your head to your toes, I will rape your children and make you watch it, you f***** with the wrong person".'

At around 9pm Miss Brown was released at Nunhead railway station and Okubote returned home to his flat in Evan Cook Close, Peckham, southeast London, the court heard.

Mr Causer said: ‘Emmanuel Okubote was subject to a tag at the time and he needed to be at home in order to comply with the conditions.

‘The records show that he arrived at home at 9.18pm and remained at that address until at least 7am.’

The Old Bailey was told Okubote had told Mr Garcia that he was going to kill him, before holding a gun to his neck, burning him with a lighter and pistol-whipping him

Jurors were told that De Silva then drove to Kitto Road in Nunhead and ordered Mr Garcia to raise £10,000.

The next day, it is alleged that Okubote arrived at around midday and threatened to keep Mr Garcia prisoner until he was given the money.

Mr Garcia was released at 12.38pm when an armed police officer noticed a blue Peugeot in Fern Court and arrested De Silva.

Three days later Okubote was arrested by armed police at his flat at 4.30pm on 19 March.

Both Okubote and De Silva made no comment in police interview but Okubote claimed in a prepared statement that he did not assault Miss Brown.

He said: ‘I would never assault a woman and I most certainly would not assault a pregnant woman. I do believe Colette has made these allegations to avoid any offences she has committed coming to light. I also deny any assault on Tabare Garcia.’

Okubote, of  Catford, southeast London, denies two counts of conspiracy to kidnap, two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison, one count of conspiracy to blackmail and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The trial continues.
