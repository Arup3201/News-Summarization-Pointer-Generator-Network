A family was devastated after they went to visit the grave of their late mother and grandmother only to find a large pile of rubble had been dumped on top of it. 

Loretta Perminas had taken her two children and three grandchildren to visit her mother Jadvyga's grave in Carlton Cemetery in Nottingham on Mother's Day but found flowers and an ornament on the grave had been pushed aside to make way for a large pile of soil.

Ms Perminas 54, said: 'It's just heartbreaking. We didn't even have anywhere to put the flowers.'

Loretta Perminas took her family to visit the grave of her mother, only to find that it had been covered by a large pile of rubble and the flowers and ornaments she had placed on the plot had been pushed aside 

The council has since apologised to the family and said they sometimes have to put soil on nearby graves when they dig a new plot. 

'To cover up someone's grave with a pile of rubble is so disrespectful - I couldn't believe it,' added Ms Perminas. 

'We wanted to say our prayers on Mother's Day but we couldn't. My grandchildren had written a prayer.

'How do you explain that their great-grandma's grave isn't there because it's just a pile of rubble? I couldn't get to sleep the next night because I was just so devastated.'

The grandmother-of-five had taken her family to visit the grave of her mother, who died last year at the age of 89. 

Since her death the family  have been saving up for a headstone but had placed a memorial plaque, vases and a Holy Mary ornament, which had been blessed by the Pope in Rome, on the grave.

Ms Perminas said it was 'heartbreaking' to find her mother's grave covered in the large mound of soil 

Jadvyga Perminas (pictured left, aged 28) died about a year ago and was buried in Carlton cemetery (pictured right about six weeks before her death last year) 

Last Wednesday Ms Perminas visited the site and left flowers and angel ornament. 

But when she returned just days later she found soil and large rocks had been dumped on her mother's grave, as another plot had been dug about six inches away.  

The family also believe the new plot encroaches on their land, because they bought three at the time so other family members could eventually be buried alongside Jadvyga. 

Ms Perminas, a jewellery dealer, added: 'We can't afford a marble memorial but it's irrelevant because it's still my mum's grave.

'I go to see it regularly and it was okay on Wednesday.

Gedling Borough Council said the rubble had been placed on top of the grave while they dug a new plot

Ms Perminas' family almost didn't realise the pile of rubble was at the site of their relative's grave

Ms Perminas said flowers and ornaments, including of Holy Mary (blue) had been pushed aside

'Everything I had left there was chucked to the side like it didn't matter.

'She loved the Holy Mary ornament and it cost hundreds of pounds. The plot belongs to us and they have no right to do that.'

Ms Perminas's son Adrian said they almost walked past the grave at first, not realising it was under a heap of discarded rubble. 

He said: 'It can't have been an accident because they've had to actually move all the stuff, and it's not like there was nowhere else to put the muck.

'Either way, there shouldn't be a grave being dug so close. It's blood-curdling to think they could have disturbed my grandmother's grave.'

Gedling Borough Council, which runs the cemetery, has apologised to the family.

Ms Perminas said her family had been saving up for a headstone and were devastated by the grave 

The plot was covered in flowers before the rubble had been dumped upon it in time for Mother's Day

Peter Barnes, portfolio holder for the environment, said: 'We are really sorry for any distress experienced by the Perminas family.

'Carlton Cemetery is a working cemetery, which means that graves are being dug out and prepared for new burials all the time.

'In this case, a grave was being prepared adjacent to the grave of the Perminas family and, as a result, earth was placed on the adjacent grave, pending the new burial.

'Given the close proximity between graves, this practice is often unavoidable but we always remove any earth that is left on adjacent graves as quickly as possible.' 

He said that any family items removed as part of a new grave being dug are returned to where they came from.
