An assistant head teacher, who was accused of assaulting a 15-year-old pupil, has been cleared.

William Stuart, 47, was today found not guilty of assaulting the girl at Graham School in Scarborough following a two-day trial.

After the verdict was read out the court erupted into cheers largely from dozens of Mr Stuart's supporters from the local community.

It's over: Teacher William Stuart, seen with wife Sarah, has been cleared of assaulting a 15-year-old pupil

The teacher's wife, Sarah, who had been anxiously sitting in court, burst into tears at the news.

Mr Stuart, who has 23 years of 
unblemished experience, was charged after the girl, who cannot be named,
 claimed the science teacher shoved her to the ground and against some 
coat pegs.

It was alleged that Mr Stuart had become angry and 'out of control' after the pupil 
ignored his instructions to stay behind when food was smeared on the 
wall of the school canteen.

But chairman of the bench Paul Osborne
 said the girl's evidence was inconsistent and did not tally with that 
of two other pupils who gave evidence for the prosecution.

Ian Glen QC, defending, had earlier told the court 19 incidents 
were detailed in the school’s bad behaviour log from September 2009 to 
July 2011 about the girl’s poor attitude in class and on school grounds.

The court also heard the girl has already been excluded this term after
 assaulting another pupil.

Mr
 Osborne said her terrible school record did nothing for her 
credibility, especially as she tried to tell the court she was a good 
pupil.

He said: 'Mr Stuart's evidence was credible and convincing.

'He has a 23-year unblemished teaching record across several schools.'

Speaking after the hearing, Anne 
Swift, from the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said the strain of the
 case has had an 'enormous impact' on Mr Stuart's family.

She said teachers accused in this way should be granted anonymity until they are convicted by a court.

Mrs Swift said: 'He (Mr Stuart) was made to feel a criminal before anything was found.

'It's
 too easy for youngsters and their families to make false accusations. 
There should be consequences for those who make false allegations.'

Mrs Swift said both his children went to the school where he teaches and, because of the accusation, he was not able to see his daughter's final concert before she left.

Asked how she would describe Mr Stuart, she said: 'An excellent teacher. A man of a good character. A pillar of the community.'

Mrs Swift said she also believed a matter like this should never have 
involved the police at all and should have been dealt with internally.

Asked whether Mr Stuart would return to his job, she said: 'It would be a great loss to his profession to have an experienced teacher decide they can't face it any more.'
