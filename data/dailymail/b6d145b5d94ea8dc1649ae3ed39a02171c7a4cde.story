Jalen Jenkins scored a sensational 75 foot game-winning heave on Saturday as the George Mason Patriots secured an improbable win over Manhattan.

In what will be hailed as the goal of the season so far in the College Basketball programme, Jenkins went for the spectacular and duly pulled it off to spark jubilant scenes from fans and players alike.

Streams of the Patriots ran on to the pitch to congratulate Jenkins, all in disbelief at what they had just seen.

Just seconds earlier Manhattan had the opportunity to close the game out,  with Shane Richards missing his second free throw - something that would haunt his side - as they failed to extend their advantage from two to three points.

And with that Jenkins was forced to heave the ball towards the basket with the game all but over in the hope of winning the match - with no timeouts left.

And somewhat miraculously the ball ended up in the hoop, securing the Patriots a first win in four after three successive defeats previously.
