As Juno took the U.S. by storm, all most East Coasters could see was snow, but the view from space was entirely different.

These images have been captured by Terry Virts, an American astronaut on the International Space Station, nearly 250 miles above the earth. He captured the the storm as it moved in on the coast, blurring the bright lights of the big cities below.

Last night, forecasters warned that two separate weather systems may bring more snow to New England over the coming days.

A storm arriving in the region late Thursday and lasting off and on through Friday night will most likely bring 2 to 4 inches of snow to Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, said Frank Nocera, a senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service.

Eastern Massachusetts, including Boston and Cape Cod, has an 'outside chance' of seeing up to six inches — adding significantly to the 2 to 3 feet of snow already dumped in parts of Massachusetts earlier this week, Nocera said

Forecasters are also monitoring a storm heading into the region over the weekend.

Depending on how it tracks, that storm could bring several more inches of snow - or snow turning into rain - from late Sunday into Monday in Connecticut, Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, Nocera said.

During the blizzard that pounded New England Monday and Tuesday, the central Massachusetts city of Worcester saw a record 34.5 inches, according to the National Weather Service. Boston saw just over 24 inches, and Providence, Rhode Island, had about 19 inches.
