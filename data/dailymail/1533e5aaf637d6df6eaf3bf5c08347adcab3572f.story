A black silhouette of Rev Sharpton in his younger days  - including the famous gold medallion - marked the marble entrance, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Celebrities dropped by at the candle-lit restaurant throughout the night to wish Rev Sharpton a happy birthday, which was decorated with hundreds of silver balloons.

Mr de Blasio said the venue was 'a site for a birthday fit for a king'.

'He merits such a grand location. Al Sharpton has been a blessing for this city. The more people criticize him, the more I want to hang out with him.'

At this point Rev Sharpton cut off Mr de Blasio, as Ms Franklin had entered the room.

He said: 'I don’t usually interrupt the mayor, but the queen is in the room.' 

The soul singer later said that Rev Sharpton was 'a man among men'.

Other people attending the celebrations were the mothers of men killed by alleged police brutality or gun crime.

Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old who was shot dead in 2012 by a police officer in Florida, was at the party.

Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in police custody in July, was also a guest.

'Anything I do, I do for them,' Rev Sharpton said. 'If I’m going to the Four Seasons, we’re all going.'

Rev Sharpton tweeted today: 'I had an unbelievable birthday party last night. I cannot put into words my feelings.'
