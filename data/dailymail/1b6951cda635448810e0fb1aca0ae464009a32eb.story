Britain's first ever left-hand driving school has been declared a sell-out success.

The one-off course, designed to give Britons the confidence to get behind the wheel on holiday, launches today, with further classes planned if demand continues.

The new school, which opens in London, can't come soon enough, with more than a quarter of Britons saying they are afraid of driving on the right hand side of the road.

It's a sign: A third of Britons say they don't research the rules of the road before travelling

A poll conducted by Skyscanner, which set up the school, also found that 36 per cent of drivers don't even bother to research overseas driving laws before embarking on their journey.

During the classes, drivers will learn to understand confusing overseas road signs as 16 per cent say this is one of their top fears.

Drivers also get a chance to use cars with the controls on the other side as one in ten (nine per cent) admit this is their number one concern.

The classes, hosted in London's Brixton, will see drivers learning to take the wheel on the left side of the car to prepare them for hiring cars on holiday this summer.

On track: The driving school aims to give Britons confidence to get behind the wheel on holiday

Skyscanner's Mary Porter said: 'With two-thirds of the world's countries driving on the right-hand side we want to give British holidaymakers the confidence they need to drive overseas.

'Rules and regulations vary from country to country so we've also published a guide to provide some clarity for drivers - including top tips on driving on the opposite side of the road.

'There is so much to discover off the beaten track so we hope people make the most of it without the fear of driving abroad.'

1. Repeat the phrase 'drive on the right' and remember you want to always be closest to the middle of the road.

2.
 On a dual carriageway or motorway remember that the 'fast' lane is the 
far left lane and the 'slow' lane is the far right lane. As a beginner, 
it's worth sticking to the right lane and take it slowly until you have 
built up your confidence.

3. When approaching a roundabout remember that you must give way to the left and drive anti-clockwise around them.

4.
 It is important to remember that the most dangerous turn is now the 
left-hand turn because it crosses the other lane of traffic.

5. 
Having a co-pilot can be a help. A backseat driver can be more of a help
 than a hindrance because a reminder to stay on the correct side is 
certainly welcome as is any help navigating.

6. If you're headed to 
Nice this summer, remember to carry a breathalyser in the car as it's a 
legal requirement for all motorists in France.

7. In some cities in 
Spain, cars must be parked on different sides of the road according to 
the day of the week so check before you pull up to a spot.

8. If 
you're planning a holiday in Spain or the Canary Islands and you wear 
glasses, the driving laws require you to carry an additional pair when 
driving.

9. In most cities in Portugal and Italy cars must be parked 
in the direction of traffic so if you're visiting this summer remember 
to follow the locals and don't be caught out.

10.
 The USA is a popular country for road-trips but it's important to 
remember rules vary from state to state so it's worth checking before 
you arrive. One law, regardless of state, is that it is illegal to pass a
 stopped school bus, whichever direction you're travelling in.

A driving abroad guide has also been produced, detailing national speed limits for other countries, unusual road signs and driving laws.

For instance, it informs drivers they must have their own breathalyser in France and must park their car in the direction of traffic in some Italian and Portuguese cities.

The UK’s first left-hand driving school has launched after it’s revealed more than a quarter of holidaymakers are afraid to drive abroad.

The course, to be held in Brixton, London, includes familiarisation with foreign road signs and roundabouts to build Brits’ confidence of taking a road trip while away.

Skyscanner is teaming up with driving instructors to offer free classes to travellers looking for practice and advice before getting behind the wheel overseas.

Nervous drivers: A quarter of Brits say they are not confident to get behind the wheel while on holiday

1. Not recognising road signs2. Getting lost3. Going around roundabouts4. Trying to navigate 5. Driving on the other side of road

The move comes after research revealed 27 per cent of Brits admitted to being afraid of driving on the opposite side of the road. 

The survey of 1,084 adults also showed 36 per cent admit they don't research driving laws before driving abroad and 24 per cent would prefer their partners to drive.

Skyscanner's Mary Porter said: ‘With two-thirds of the world's countries driving on the right-hand side of the road we wanted to give British holidaymakers the confidence they need to drive overseas. 

‘Rules and regulations vary from country to country so we've also published a guide to provide some clarity for drivers including top tips on driving on the opposite side of the road. 

‘There is so much to discover off the beaten track so we hope people make the most of it without the fear of driving abroad.’

Unfamiliar signs: Not understanding road signs is a top fear for Brits driving abroad

The guide includes a list of national speed limits for UK's most popular holiday destinations and also a list of unusual road signs they may come across as this is cited as the most fearful part of driving overseas.

There are also top tips on how to drive on the right as well as a list of some of the more unusual driving laws from across the globe.

Classes will run on Saturday, July 12 in Brixton, London and are subject to availability.

Those looking to take part in the left-hand driving school can apply for a class via the Skyscanner website, www.skyscanner.net.
