Into orbit: Music legend Sarah Brightman confirmed she will be a space tourist

A Russian space official has dismissed
British singer Sarah Brightman's plans to blast off on her planned 
mission as a space tourist as a publicity stunt.

The ex-wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber is treating her scheduled 2015 trip on a Soyuz rocket as a way of boosting sales of her latest songs, he implied.

And the official claimed that despite a high profile announcement in Moscow, no contract has been signed for the 'I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper' singer to become a space tourist at an estimated cost of £30 million.

'It is very likely that the singer 
made an announcement about her possible trip to the International Space 
Station in order to advertise the release of her new album and to stir 
up interest in her world tour planned for next year,' the unnamed source
told Interfax news agency.

The source further claimed it was 
likely on the mission earmarked for Brightman's flight in October 2015 
all three seats would go to professional Russian cosmonauts.

However, a representative said the official's claims were not true, and said that Ms Brightman was still due to become a space tourist.

They said: ''As previously announced during the press conference Sarah is confirmed for a future orbital spaceflight mission to the ISS.

'The final scheduling of her trip to the space station will be determined by Roscosmos and the ISS partners.'

Brightman, 52, underwent and passed 
medical tests in Moscow earlier this year before last month confirming 
her bid to fly to the International Space Station.

Now the official has also expressed concerns over her condition in 2015 or later.

'It is not clear how the upcoming 
three years, one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling 
around the world, will affect her health,' he was quoted as saying.

Recently space flight program director
Alexei Krasnov admitted no firm decisions had been made on the 2015 
launch penciled for the soprano.

'The mission commander must be a 
professional. There can be no compromise on that. The other two 
candidates are still being discussed. We have time to adopt a decision,'
he said.

This was seen as backtracking by Krasnov from his earlier statement that 'Sarah's flight will take place in October 2015'.

At the time her trip was announced, the Russian Space Agency had appeared enthusiastic about the planned mission.

The former wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber has said at a Moscow press conference announcing her flight: 'This voyage is a product of a dream, 
my dream. Finally it can be a reality.

'I am more excited about this than
anything I have done in my life to date.'

She raised the possibility she might 'sing a song from space'.

One test involved being put in a 
centrifuge replicating the gravitational force she will face on 
returning to Earth. She was also obliged to sit on ‘a rotating chair 
that makes you sick’.

Miss Brightman, who is estimated to 
have a personal fortune of £30million, revealed her family had 
reservations about her becoming a cosmonaut.

She said: ‘I had to think about it 
very carefully and take my family into consideration. When I told my 
mother, it was very sweet. She shivered, but I told her the Soyuz has a 
very good record and then she was fine.’

The singer will complete her training in an intensive five-week period before blasting off.

With Nasa’s space shuttles now 
retired, Russian Soyuz spacecraft are the only vessels currently capable
of carrying people to the International Space Station.

As a result, 
open seats available for tourists have been scarce in recent years.

The most recent tourist on a Soyuz 
was Canadian Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who paid around 
£21.8million for his trip in 2009.

Brightman, whose 1978 single I Lost 
My Heart To A Starship Trooper reached number six in the UK charts, said
seeing fuzzy TV images of the first ‘bouncing’ human steps on the moon 
in 1969 when she was eight years old inspired her to dream about 
travelling to space.

‘It was something miraculous. For me,
it was an epiphany,’ she said. ‘It seemed so unrealistic and crazy at 
the time but I suddenly saw that it was possible.’

The singer made her name playing 
Christine in The Phantom Of The Opera, with the part written for her by 
Lloyd Webber, who she married in 1984. She has enjoyed a successful solo
career since her divorce in 1990.
