A desperate daughter begged police to save her mother and baby half sister as they were being hacked to death with a machete, hammer and screwdriver while she listened on the phone, a court heard today. 

Roland McKoy allegedly inflicted 'truly horrific injuries' on Valerie Forde, 45, and 22-month-old Jahzara at the family home in Hackney, north London, on March 31 this year.

The brutal attack was heard by Mrs Forde's 28-year-old daughter Carrise who became 'hysterical' when she heard her mother and half sister's screams over the phone and called police, jurors at the Old Bailey heard.

Heartfelt: A poignant note on a floral tribute left outside the family home

Three months earlier, Mrs Forde had ended her 18-year relationship with McKoy and had set that particular date as a deadline for him to move out of the three-bedroom terrace house.

But in the weeks leading up to the deaths, McKoy, 54, who had become 'jealous and difficult', repeatedly threatened to kill her before committing suicide, the court heard.

In January this year, Mrs Forde texted her sister saying 'I have to be very very careful and pray for my safety each day and night', jurors were told.

The following month, she reported him to police after he told a neighbour that he was going to burn the house down with everyone including himself inside, the court heard.

When her brother confronted McKoy, he insisted there was nothing to worry about and he had no plans to hurt his ex-partner or their baby daughter.

Meanwhile, Mrs Forde began tape recording their conversations or ringing an aunt or her older daughter Carrise Forde on an 'open line'.

On the day of the murders, McKoy had still not moved out and the argument that ensued was allegedly overheard down the phone by Ms Forde.

She heard screams from her mother and half sister before the defendant said: 'This is the destruction that you have brought onto the family', jurors heard

The court heard that the young child had seen her mother being killed before McKoy slit her throat with the machete.

The brutal attack was witnessed by Mrs Forde's  Carrise, 28, who became 'hysterical' when she heard her mother and half sister's screams over the phone and called police, jurors at the Old Bailey (pictured) heard

Prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'It is plain that the defendant had attacked Valerie Forde with the hammer, slashed her face and neck with the machete and stabbed her multiple times with the screwdriver.

'It is equally clear from the evidence that the defendant used that same machete to cut Jahzara's neck from one side to the other. Each attack was a brutal one.'

Police went to the house in Oswald's Meade and found Mrs Forde and Jahzara dead on the first floor.

Beside them, McKoy was curled up in a foetal position surrounded by weapons. When he was roused, he was sick and his vomit smelled of bleach, the court heard.

Mr Brown told jurors that a note had been found on the dead woman's face that 'seeks in some perverse way to blame Valerie Forde for what had happened'.

The note read: 'Valerie Forde you never stop playing derty ticks (sic) for many years on all people places and things you targets. Now the world must see the sudden destru..tions you creates in our families, our home and on yourself. Our fame in history. Roland.'

Mr Brown said the motive for the double murder was 'beyond sensible comprehension' but the evidence suggested it was 'little more than anger and resentment'.

The court heard how the Mrs Forde's relationship with McKoy began in 1996 but hit the rocks after she discovered that he was already married to a woman called Pamela McKoy.

In 2006, Mrs Forde got a job working at a community project where she became centre manager.

But McKoy could not hold down a steady job and in later years earned some money working as a handyman.

Mrs Forde told friends that he was 'lazy and used her for money' and also that he was mentally abusing her.

McKoy denies the murders and the trial continues.
