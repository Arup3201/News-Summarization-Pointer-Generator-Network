Crumbling into the ground, this is the hauntingly beautiful relic of a church left abandoned for 30 years after miraculously surviving one of the world's most devastating natural disasters.

It was hit by the tragic Irpinia earthquake of 1980, which killed 3,000, severely injured a further 10,000, and left 300,000 homeless in the tiny village of Conza, southern Italy.

Survivors fled to the countryside five miles away, rebuilt the town there, and never returned.

Crumbling: This is the shell of a chapel that incredibly survived the Irpinia earthquake of 1980 in Conza, south Italy, that killed 3,000 and injured 10,000

Discoloured: The walls which were once painted vibrant blue, red and gold have become marred by dust over the years after villagers fled

But incredibly, the once-grandiose chapel remains as a lasting, haunting reminder of the past.

Large swathes of the roof have collapsed, leaving wicker and wood panels where there was once elaborately carved white stone.

The vibrant blues and opulent golds that once coated the walls have been marred by dust.

Swamped with lumps of brick and splintered doors, one chamber is almost impossible to walk through.

And the altar is a shell of the stone monument it once was.

Destroyed: The once opulent white stone ceilings have given way, exposing the wicker foundations and wooden eaves, leaving the ground swamped in debris

Stuck in time: These prayer stands may be smashed and coated in a film of cobwebs, but they still offer a glimpse into the history of the village's Catholic heritage

Capturing the eerie structure, photographer Gianluca Tesauro and artist Jorge Mañes Rubio aim to shed light on churches across southern Italy that have been inexplicably abandoned.

It is part of a series titled Buona Fortuna, or 'good fortune', which the pair will use to petition for the derelict monuments to be reopened to the public.

They said: 'Most churches and chapels were bricked up, waiting for a more than unlikely reconstruction.

'Unfortunately bricks didn’t keep looters away and most of the relics have been stolen.

'Given the great importance and value that these religious symbols have in southern Italy, most figures, santos, madonnas, and paintings have disappeared, leaving behind a significant cultural void hard to replace.

Unrecognisable: The altar has been stripped to its bare brick foundations - a dramatic transformation from the opulent style of decorative Italian churches

Looted: Furniture and any remaining items are strewn about the chapel, which has been raided by looters over the past three decades. Photographer Gianluca Tesauro and artist Jorge Manes Rubio want to shed light on the abandoned monument and a number of others across earthquake-hit southern Italy to preserve what is left

'As artists, we are on a permanent quest for this kind of situations, where our work can contribute in changing the way we perceive these places.'

They added: 'At this moment though our interest goes beyond these photographs.

'We are working in the first intervention that will reopen one of these churches to the public for the first time in 35 years.

'To do so, we are working with public and private institutions, plus we have created a limited edition of prints in order to finance the production of new artworks for these churches, that will replace the originals that have been stolen. '
