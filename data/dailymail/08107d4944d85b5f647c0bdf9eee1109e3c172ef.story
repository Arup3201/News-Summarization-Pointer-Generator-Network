President Obama is weighing 19 different gun control measures that he could enforce without congressional approval as he prepares to unveil on Wednesday a comprehensive plan to address gun violence.

Vice President Joe Biden discussed some of the measures with House Democrats during a meeting Monday, after Obama confirmed during the final press conference of his first term that he was prepared to side-step Congress to strengthen laws regulating firearms.

'It was all focusing on enforcing existing law, administering things like improving the background database, things like that that do not involve a change in the law but enforcing and making sure that the present law is administered as well as possible,' Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia told Politico about the meeting with Biden.

President Obama is weighing 19 different gun control measures that he could enforce without congressional approval

'I think everybody acknowledges that the assault weapons ban is a challenge, but other things — like the size of the magazines, the background checks, straw purchases — are all things that have a good chance of passing.'

Obama will be joined by Biden and a group of children from around the country who wrote letters to the president concerning gun safety in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut last month that left 27 people dead.

Republicans claim that Obama would be 
overstepping his bounds by taking executive actions on gun control, and 
Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, has threatened impeachment as a result.

'The President’s actions are not just an attack on the Constitution and a violation of his sworn oath of office – they are a direct attack on Americans that place all of us in danger,' Stockman said. 'I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including, but not limited to, eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment.'

The executive orders under review may include granting greater power to federal authorities for gun research, as well as measures requiring background checks for gun dealers' employees, wider sharing of gun databases between federal and state agencies and stricter regulations on gun inventories.

Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading Obama's push for greater gun controls, discussed some of the potential executive actions with House Democrats during a meeting Monday

'I'm confident that there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation and that are within my authority as president,' Obama said Monday.

Obama will reveal which measures he is considering on Wednesday, when he is planning to present Congress with his comprehensive plan to address gun control.

He is also reviewing measures that would need congressional approval, including an assault weapons ban and a limit on high-capacity magazine ammunition. 

Gun rights groups fear that tighter controls will restrict responsible, sane adults from owning, obtaining and using certain firearms.

Obama said Monday that those fears are unfounded.

'Part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow here it comes, and everybody's guns are going to be taken away,' Obama said.

He blamed gun rights groups for 'ginning up' those fears.

'My starting point is not to worry about the politics,' Obama said. 'My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works. What should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we're reducing the incidence of gun violence?'
