Aides to Chris Christie knew traffic closures they spitefully ordered on the George Washington Bridge were putting lives at risk after just a few hours – but carried on snarling traffic for another four days, it was revealed Friday.

A huge dump of documents showed the Republican-orchestrated political revenge stunt that threatens the White House ambitions of the New Jersey governor continued for an entire work week with little regard for public safety.

Before noon on the first day the traffic pattern was changed, September 9, bringing the streets of Fort Lee, N.J. to a standstill, Port Authority community relations director Tina Lado emailed deputy executive director Bill Baroni and interstate capital projects director David Wildstein – a boyhood friend of Gov. Christie – to warn them that public safety was at risk.

'Peggy Thomas, [Fort Lee] Borough Administrator, called me regarding the increased volume and congestion of AM rush traffic throughout the Borough as a result of the GWB toll lanes adjustment that occurred,' Lado wrote.

Contempt: David Wildstein, a long-time political ally and friend of Christie, orchestrated the traffic closures. He was said to be 'Christie's man' at the Port Authority

'She
 mentioned that there were 2 incidents that Ft Lee PD and EMS had 
difficulty responding to: a missing child (later found) and a cardiac 
arrest. She stated additionally that the Borough and PD had no advance 
notice of the planned change.'

The new details came from emails included in a trove of documents released Friday by a New Jersey legislative
 committee.

Florence Genova, a 91-year-old Fort 
Lee woman died that day when first-responders needed twice the typical 
amount of time to reach her home. Her daughter later said the woman's 
death didn't result from the traffic jam.

But a fuming Fort Lee, N.J. Mayor Mark
 Sokolich told Baroni in writing that his town's emergency services were
 'experiencing tremendous response time delays ... Unquestionably, this 
decision has negatively impacted public safety here in Fort Lee.'

Ordinary commuters, too, were incensed.

New Jersey physician Richard Fried called the Port Authority on Sept. 9 after 'not moving an inch' in traffic for an hour, he told MailOnline.

His frustration rose up the chain of command, judging from his mention in one of the emails released Friday.

Dr. Fried said he didn't vote for Gov. Christie but finds his style 'refreshing' and 'likes aspects of his character.' Still, he now hopes everyone responsible in the political prank will face charges.

'I think there should be heavy penalties,' he said. 'This is such an abuse of power. This is criminal. Nobody thought a step or two ahead about what was going to happen when they closed these lanes.'

It wasn't until four days later that Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye issued an 
agency-wide cease-and-desist order, putting the traffic patterns back to
 normal and releasing Fort Lee from its all-day gridlock.

Foye
 emailed his senior staff on the morning of Friday, Sept. 13, 
complaining about a 'hasty and ill-advised decision' that 'resulted in 
delays to emergency vehicles. I pray that no life has been lost or trip 
of a hospital- or hospice-bound patient delayed.'

In
 Foye's angry, defensive screed, he vowed to 'get to the bottom of this 
abusive decision which violates everything this agency stands for' and, 
he said, also violated state and federal laws.

Baroni, his deputy, responded with caution about leaks to the press: 'Pat we need to discuss prior to any comments.'

'Bill,
 we are going to fix this fiasco,' Foye replied. 'I am on my way to 
office to discuss.'

And in a
 closing line that may come to indicate the beginning of a political 
cover-up, Foye added: 'There can be no public discourse.'

Baroni forwarded the message to David 
Samson, the Port Authority's chairman and a fellow Christie appointee. 
'General, can I call you on this now?' he asked,

Like Gov. Christie, Samson has denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the traffic lane closures.

Foye's email followed an early morning phone call on Sept. 13 with George Washington Bridge manager Robert Durando.

'He asked about the test,' Durando wrote Wildstein at 6:47 that morning. 'He asked why he wasn't told.'

Wildstein wasn't happy about Foye's intervention, wrote that he was 'going nuts' his scheme had been canceled, and promised 'retaliation.'

In another email from Durando, he shared with Port Authority staff 'a flavor of the complaints' officials had received from New Jerseyans about their lengthened morning commutes into New York City. 

One patron, according to the email, 
'says that the Port Authority "doesn't care about their customers and 
they are playing God with people's jobs."'

'Her
 husband was 40 minutes late to a job that he just got after being out 
of work for over a year,' a public relations representative relayed from
 an irate taxpayer.. 'She said a lot of other thigns, but I will spare 
you her rant!'

Grim: Christie's staff listen sullenly to his press conference hours after he fired a trusted co-worker. Only time will tell whether Christie's insistence that he knew nothing holds true

Wildstein and Baroni both resigned in December as pressure mounted for explanations of the traffic foul-up.

Gov.
 Christie apologized publicly Thursday for the actions of his 
underlings, and fired two more of them: deputy chief of staff Bridget 
Kelly and long-time campaign manager Bill Stepien. He cited their callous indifference to the welfare of taxpayers – and their dishonesty – in dismissing them.

His state's top Democrats are investigating the Republican Christie administration for 
allegedly retaliating against Sokolich, a Democrat, after he 
declined to endorse the governor's re-election bid.

'Try
 as we may to understand ... we are reaching the conclusion that there 
are punitive overtones associated with this initiative,' Sokolich told 
Baroni in his Sept. 12 letter. 

'What other conclusion could we possibly reach?'

The documents released Friday provide 
no direct evidence that Christie was aware of any plot to exact revenge 
through the traffic closures. 

His administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge 
into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study 
supervised by Wildstein.

Patrick Foye, the executive director of the New York / New Jersey Port Authority, angrily ordered the traffic lane closures reversed, but not until public safety risks persisted for nearly a full work week

In a lengthy press briefing on Thursday, 
the defiant governor forcefully denied any involvement.

But his spokesman Michael Drewniak, however, did not respond to MailOnline's request Friday for information about any health- or safety-related complaints about bridge traffic that the governor's office received during the four days the lanes from Fort Lee were affected.

Kelly, whom Christie said lied to him repeatedly about her involvement in the traffic-closure episode, had her own view of Foye's management style.

On Oct. 3, Wildstein forwarded her a news account about his boss's angry email ordering an end to what he would later claim was a formal test of toll lanes.

'Still pissing me off,' Wildstein told Kelly.

'No doubt.' she emailed back. 'Foye is a bad guy.'

But it was Kelly who, with 
Wildstein and others, reveled in the calculated effort to retaliate 
against 
Sokolich through his commuting constituents.

'Time
 for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the 
event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive payback.

'Got 
it,' responded Wildstein, later asking, 'Is it wrong that I am smiling', when he saw a message that read: 'I feel sorry for the kids' who were stuck in school buses that morning.

Christie is set to be inaugurated for a second term as governor on January 21.
