Atlanta-based rapper and reality TV star Benzino, who is listed in good condition in hospital, believes his late mother's hand may have intervened when authorities say his nephew shot him from another vehicle in her funeral procession on Saturday.

Born Raymond Scott, the 48-year-old 
former owner of hip hop magazine The Source was wounded after an 
argument broke out between family members in the funeral procession 
making its way through the streets of Duxbury just before noon.

‘Feel much better. God is real. My mother touched me I'm certain,’ Scott, 48, posted on Sunday on his Instagram account, which has nearly 200,000 followers.

According
 to sources, at one point during the procession, the suspect pulled up 
in his Bentley next to Benzino's red Dodge SUV and opened fire, striking
 him three times.

The 
hip hop artist-turned-cast member of the show Love and Hip Hop Atlanta 
was taken to South Shore Hospital with non life-threatening injuries, 
the station WHDH reported. His condition has been described as stable.

Relatives
 said that Benzino and his nephew have been at odds for some time, and 
the hostility between the two men came to a head during the funeral for 
the rapper's mother, Mary Scott, who passed away on March 20.

Last week, Benzino took to Instagram to share photos of his late mother and talk about his grief and sense of loss, writing in one of the captions that he did not know how he will continue living knowing that Mrs Scott was gone. 

Benzino is best known for starting The
 Source magazine in 1988. A decade later, he joined the rap collective 
Made Men, and his other claim to fame is that the entertainer has been 
locked in a feud with Eminem for more than a decade. His net worth is 
estimated to be $10million.

Since
 2012, the 48-year-old rapper has been starring in Love and Hip Hop 
Atlanta, which premiered on VH1 that year as a spinoff of Love and Hip 
Hop New York.

The 
reality show follows the lives of more than a dozen local hip hop 
artists. The third season of the program will premiere in May.
