As student pranks go, it could have been worse. 

A forgetful housemate returned home to find his friends had broken into his  room and filled it 5,000 balloons to teach him a lesson for leaving his room unlocked.

But rather than punishing the Marine Engineering student, referred to only as Max, the prank victim told friends it was a 'dream come true'.

But rather than punishing the Marine Engineering student the prank victim told friends it was a 'dream come true'

The student had left the door to his room in Southampton unlocked when he went home for the weekend. 

As punishment, his housemates, who are in their second year at Southampton University, snuck in and filled his room with 5,000 balloons.

It took seven hours and 15 people to blow up the balloons, which had to be inflated by hand after the pumps broke.

There were so many of the inflatables that they cascaded out of the room and into the house hallway

The housemates spent two days popping the balloons but said they are still finding them around the house now

One of the dedicated pranksters said: 'His reaction was well worth it but I never want to blow a balloon up again'

The video captures Max entering his room, into a sea of balloons, which he tells his friend's is a 'dream come true'.

Neighbours also found themselves inundated after one of the students opened the front door, sending the balloons into the street.

Tom Evans, who organised the prank, added: 'Definitely would do it again. The question now is how to make it better than last time.'
