She may be the youngest member of the Kardashian brood, but Kylie Jenner is already making a name for herself. 

The 17-year-old was last week unveiled as the ambassador for beauty brand Nip + Fab  - and now her striking campaign shots have been unveiled in all their glory.

Giving her model big sister Kendall a run for her money, Kylie proves she can hold her own in front of the camera.

Speaking to FEMAIL about snapping up the young star, Maria Hatzistefanis, President of Nip + Fab, said: 'I am thrilled to be working with Kylie Jenner; she is cool, edgy and an international beauty icon. 

'Kylie has been a fan of the brand for the last year and it’s great to have her in London to meet fans. It’s an honour to welcome Kylie as a friend and I hope this will be the beginning of a long and exciting relationship.'

Maria and Kylie spent the weekend hosting beauty events and meeting Kylie's fans. 'Kylie has great energy and a genuine passion for beauty,' said Maria of working with the star. 

'She is very professional, works hard and it’s been a pleasure working with her.'

Sharing her favourite products from the brand with FEMAIL, Kylie said: 'I never travel without Nip + Fab Dragon's Blood Fix Serum, it has hyaluronic acid in it so instantly plumps my skin with moisture.'

To help her unwind after a busy day on the showbiz circuit, Kylie swears by the brand's Yoga Blends Body collection.

'They are infused with lavender so it relaxes and de-stresses and it’s great for exfoliating before a spray tan,' she said.

Sharing the best beauty tip that one of her famous sisters has ever shared with her, she said: 'Khloe always told me to put sunscreen on my hands!'.

Kylie Jenner, 17, was unveiled as the ambassador for Nip + Fab - an innovative skincare range she loves - last week and has been promoting her new role in London this weekend

Being the youngest of the Kardashian/Jenner clan, Kylie Jenner has got big shoes to fill. Or should that be heels?

Her big sister Kendall is a top catwalk model these days, but dark horse Kylie is giving her a run for her money when it comes to being a style icon.

The 17-year-old reality star was the ever professional model in a recent fashion shoot and looked particularly gorgeous in an on trend leopard print skirt by Carven, which we want to get our claws into it ASAP.

Proving she can model just as well as any of her sisters, Kylie oozed perfection in the zip front midi skirt, so we've hunted it down at My Theresa, where it's now even in the sale. It's a true style investment that will be on trend every season without fail. It has more than nine lives!

So snap up this statement skirt now with a quick click to the right, because trust us, it won't be sticking around for long. Or if you're after the same look on a budget, then Boohoo's pencil skirt is on our wish list! We'll be teaming it with a black knitted polo neck to see us through spring.

This is the latest in a string of successes for the young star, who recently landed herself a shoot in the highly acclaimed fashion bible Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book.

When Kanye West, who is married to her older sister Kim, recently debuted his first collection with sports brand Adidas, it was Kylie who he asked to star in his show in New York.

Kylie also recently landed the cover of Fault magazine and looked high fashion as she posed in an Alexander Wang crop top with her hair pulled to the side in a fishtail plait.

More experimental than her sisters in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie regularly posts pictures of herself trying out different make-up and hairstyles on her Instagram account so her latest coup is perfect for the starlet.
