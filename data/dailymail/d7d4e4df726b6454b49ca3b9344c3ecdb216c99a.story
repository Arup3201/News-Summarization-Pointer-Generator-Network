A lot of people will have dressed up as a character from a Disney or Star Wars film at some point in their lives but not many will have dressed their dog as one.

These astonishing pets were all contestants at different 'creative dog grooming' contests across America, where winners can scoop over $30,000 in prize money for a single event.

The images were taken by animal photographer Ren Netherland, from Florida, who travels thousands of miles every year to the country's most extreme grooming competitions.

All of the dogs have been sheared and 
coloured to achieve the final look. Contestants at the grooming 
competitions visited by Mr Netherland included a dog dressed as the 
characters of Sesame Street, one dressed as Yoda from Star Wars and 
another dressed as different Disney characters.

Other
dogs were dressed as tigers, elephants, robots, lions, dragons, and 
exotic birds. It takes two intense hours for the groomers to produce 
their masterpieces before facing judges. 

Mr
Netherland said: 'The owners have to grow out their dog's hair in 
preparation for the show - so that it's long enough for them to make 
something. 'They train and rehearse throughout the year in preparation 
for the competition, whittling their creation down to a fine art.

'The
best thing for spectators is that when the poodles fist come onto the 
stage, they just look like normal poodles. Suddenly they are transformed
before your eyes into something colourful and completely different. The
dogs seem to enjoy the pampering and all the attention.'
