Manchester City are not impressed with the in-house Old Trafford TV station encouraging Barcelona fans to mock City’s lack of history compared to United’s glittering back story.

An MUTV camera crew was outside Old Trafford talking to Barca supporters, who were visiting the stadium ahead of the Champions League game at the Etihad, with the questioning designed to be at City’s expense.

The staged answers included: ‘Manchester is known as Manchester United’ . . . ‘Apart from the last two years, Manchester City is not known in Spain’ . . . ‘The comparison is like between  Barcelona and Espanyol’.

There is surprise at City that MUTV should resort to such small-minded ideas during a troubled period. City policy, since their Carlos Tevez ‘Welcome to Manchester’ poster after he switched clubs in 2009, has been to not rile the neighbours. And even at United, there is criticism with one official saying: ‘We take a dim view of this.’

MUTV’s TV listings are also open to ridicule, with Thursday’s schedule having All The Own Goals followed by Moyes: The first six months.

The ongoing scandal around secondary ticket site Viagogo’s continuing selling of Twickenham tickets, despite successful court actions against them by the RFU, is highlighted by the Owen Farrell ticket for the Ireland game being traded on the site before it was acquired. Touts are now using Viagogo to sell tickets they do not have, speculating they will acquire the right seat before collection. 

Farrell — absolved from wrongdoing — left a ticket for Saracens team-mate Nils Mordt and it ended up being handed over by a tout to the purchaser, who bought it the day before on Viagogo for £440. The tout got the ticket less than two hours before kick-off from a Hospitality client who had bought it for face value from Saracens coach Alex Sanderson.

England batsman Jonathan Trott is recovering from a stress-related illness. So it doesn’t seem the best idea to join Twitter — used as a social media bear pit by England team-mates as shown by Kevin Pietersen yesterday sniping back in tweets at criticisms by Matt Prior.

The FA’s roster of sponsors were asking questions yesterday as to why England manager Roy Hodgson was televised at Wembley announcing his squad for next week’s Denmark game in front of a backdrop monopoly of William Hill branding rather than shared logo exposure.

The FA agreed the deal  with the bookmakers as part of a Hodgson personal appearance. But with the FA currently investigating Tranmere manager Ronnie Moore for breaching betting regulations, it smacked of double standards.

WAGs pay their way

Roy Hodgson is relaxed about England WAGs coming to Florida for the pre-World Cup camp and on to Brazil for the tournament — in the knowledge not many are expected to travel.

Apart from staying with the players at Miami’s Mandarin Oriental, all travel arrangements will have to be made by the families. This contrasts with the WAGs circus in Baden Baden in 2006 where Nancy, Posh, Coleen, Cheryl and Co were looked after by FA administrator Carol Day, for whom former England U21 boss Stuart Pearce left his wife of 20 years last October.

Lord’s Taverners, grumbling about England quitter Graeme Swann being honoured at their spring lunch, are also up in arms about the trustees decision to sell their £6m headquarters near Buckingham Palace, which was purchased with the help of the £1m raised by Sir John Spurling running the London Marathon in 1999. LT chief executive Paul Robin said selling the building would mean more money going to charity.

Lawyers as ever will be the main winners over financial fair play at home and abroard. UEFA are expecting numerous appeals to the Court of Abritration for Sport when they hand out sanctions — possibly wage caps — in June for those found to have breached FFP rules. The 76 clubs being probed include Manchester City. And this follows 10 Football League clubs threatening legal action over FFP Championship rules.
