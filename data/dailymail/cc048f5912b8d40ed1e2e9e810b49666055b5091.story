Bacon and cupcakes: both delicious foodstuffs, but would you really want to brush your teeth with them?

If the answer to that question is an eyebrow-raising yes, you're in luck: now you can, thanks to Firebox, the online go-to shop for fun, quirky and gimmicky bits and pieces, who are selling both bacon- and cupcake-flavoured toothpastes.

The eccentric products were created by Accoutrements, an American novelty gift company who also sell such wacky products as ranch-flavoured dental floss, nihilist flavourless toothpaste, pickle lip balm and French fry lip balm.

If you have a sweet tooth this cupcake toothpaste should be right up your street

A tube of bacon toothpaste or cupcake toothpaste - the perfect gift for someone with a super-sweet tooth - will set you back Â£6.99 and keep your breath piggy-fresh (or vanilla-fresh) for hours.

Bacon has been mathematically proven to make most things taste better, but what about smell better? Available to buy for the ultimate enthusiast pork in your life on Firebox: bacon soap. But if a pint is more their thing there's always the beer-flavoured soap.

For bacon fun for all the family this Christmas, why not invest in some bacon candy canes, or some bacon frosting with which to decorate the cake, both being sold by Accoutrements.

The site also sells such oddities as absinthe breath mints. Just don't mistake them for the real thing.

If you can't get through the day without the whiff of bacon, wash yourself in the stuff

Firebox are also selling beer-flavoured soap for ale-lovers

Is there anything that isn't made better by the addition of bacon?
