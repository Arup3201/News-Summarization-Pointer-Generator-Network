Turns out a kettle and microwave just aren't cutting it for British workers any more.

A study has revealed  the criteria that would make an ideal working environment - and it has more than just a tea and coffee-making station.

A survey of 2,000 office employees found that it's not just location that matters, but also décor, amenities and food menus.

Workers also said they wanted music played daily in their dream office

It turns out offices such as Google and Innocent are leading the way with their fresh take on office environments.

They have proved among the most desirable places to work, due to their emphasis on a laid-back atmosphere and intriguing choice of décor.

The offices of Innocent have areas of turfed floor with picnic benches, whereas Google's offices are known for their bright and sleek interior. 

It all starts with location, with workers stating that they would prefer their offices to be a three-mile commute away from their home.

Four in ten also added that they would prefer it if their work was situated in a converted manor or warehouse - ideally next to a river.

It seems a spacious work area is a high criteria of many workers, as Brits also expected floor-to-ceiling windows and natural lighting.

Other décor criteria included brighter-coloured walls, comfortable chairs and modern furnishings. 

For summer days, office employees also suggested a garden space for 'al fresco' board meetings and summer socialising.

In these outdoor areas, workers prioritised 'a great view', with the addition of sun loungers, picnic tables and exotic plants.  

The dream office would also have a bigger emphasis on a relaxing atmosphere and creative leisure time.

Music would be played all the time, there would be designated napping areas, board games and pool tables.

Unsurprisingly, British workers were disappointed with the lack of eating facilities in their current work places.

Many wanted a canteen with a daily-changing menu, free fresh fruit bowls, and one in four wanted a buffet trolley to deliver cakes and drinks every Friday.

Many employees wanted on-site crèches to look after their children while they worked, others wanted small accessories such as high-tech espresso machines

The study from 72Point, also revealed that many desired additional amenities that would either solve daily inconveniences or make the office a more well-rounded place.

For those conscious of fitness, or those with children, 37 per cent of people wanted an on-site gym as well as a crèche.  

A spokesperson for Furniture at Work has stated: 'Sadly, the majority of offices were built decades ago, which can cause many workers to feel demotivated.

'No employee should feel cramped or ill due to their outdated surroundings, so it could be worth mentioning it to your supervisors.'

In addition to improved amenities, people also wanted accessories such as hair-straighteners in the toilets as well as high-tech espresso machines. 

The spokesperson added: 'Offices are definitely changing, and it could be to everyone’s benefit.

'Having modern furnishings, bright décor and lots of time outdoors may become a standard trait of office employment.'
