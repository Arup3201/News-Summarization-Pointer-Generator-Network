The Scottish government is demanding tax cuts to bailout the oil industry, just four months after claiming that booming North Sea reserves would bankroll independence.

The move has been ridiculed by supporters of the Union, who point out that if voters had backed independence in September the country would not be in crisis.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude – the global benchmark – has more than halved since June to around $48 (£31.50). Experts predict it could fall as low as $31 (£20.44) by April.

The weak oil price seriously undermines the claim by the SNP's Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon nationalists that an independent Scotland could rely on its natural resources.

Scotland's Energy Minister last night issued a demand for new tax breaks to shore up the industry, after BP announced it was cutting 200 onshore workers and 100 contractor roles from its 3,500 staff in the North Sea.

Mr Ewing said: 'It is clear to me that the UK Government has accepted it must act on tax. My question is why wait in respect of the supplementary charge until March

'This is the most serious jobs situation Scotland has faced in living memory.'

But rival parties have this week condemned the SNP for demanding help from Westminster just months after wanting to sever ties with the rest of the UK. 

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: 'The SNP told the people of Scotland the price of oil would rise and rise - that was a deceit.

'No end of experts pointed out the many flaws in this fanciful policy, but they were dismissed by the Scottish Government as scaremongering.

'In the last few weeks we've seen just how volatile the price of oil really is.'  

Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Jackie Baillie accused the Scottish Government of being 'silent on the issue' of the falling oil price.

'We know why the SNP are sitting on their hands. If they take the oil crisis seriously, it undermines their entire electoral strategy. 

'The SNP cannot ignore a crisis which threatens jobs in Scotland now for their own political aims in May. Scotland needs a Government that will stand up for jobs and protect public services. The SNP have no intention of doing either.'

Malcolm Webb, chief executive of industry body Oil & Gas UK, called for 'urgent action' to halt the decline and asked the Treasury to radically reduce the tax burden. He added: 'Tax rates ranging from 60 per cent to 80 per cent are no longer sustainable.'

North Sea oil expert Sir Ian Wood, who carried out a major report for the UK government, is calling on Chancellor George Osborne to dramatically cut taxes on the industry by 10 per cent.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What is really important is to look now, and set a tax regime that makes it absolutely clear, it's a medium-term tax regime as the oil price recovers.

'It's got to, in my opinion, include at least a 10 per cent tax reduction… to take it down to 50 per cent for normal corporation tax. On that basis, hopefully operators will have the motivation through what's going to be a very difficult period.'

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond used to claim oil revenues would generate the funds for Scotland to become an independent country

Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael is said to be pushing for 'tax relief for the sector' to be included in the March Budget.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said yesterday: 'I can't prejudge what the Chancellor will announce in the March Budget but I wouldn't be coming to Scotland today to talk to the industry if we weren't thinking about those issues.

'The threat to jobs has been brought home by the news from BP today. We have great sympathy with all those directly affected.'

Rising production costs coupled with the global drop in fuel prices have forced energy companies to operate in tougher market conditions in the North Sea.

Drilling for new oilfields in UK waters has fallen by a fifth, while exploration in other North Sea countries remains buoyant.

But the idea of tax breaks buries the claim from the SNP that Scottish independence could be bankrolled by oil revenues.

The Scottish government has also suddenly stopped publishing oil revenue projections which it used to release to show how Scotland could afford to go it alone.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney this week warned Scotland had only been able to withstand the 'negative shock' of the plunging oil price by being within the Union.

While falling oil costs benefit the economy as a whole, cutting the cost of travel and food in particular, Scotland is taking a hit.

Mr Carney, appearing before the Commons Treasury Select Committee, was asked about an estimate that the slide would blow a £6 billion hole in Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP).

He told MPs: 'It is a negative shock to the Scottish economy but it is a negative shock substantially mitigated by the fiscal arrangements in the UK.'

Mr Carney suggested the impact on Scotland of the lower price would be cushioned by the wider benefits to the UK as a whole - where falling petrol prices are putting more money into consumers' pockets.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned the falling oil price poses a risk of jobs in the North Sea.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: 'The SNP told the people of Scotland the price of oil would rise and rise - that was a deceit.

'No end of experts pointed out the many flaws in this fanciful policy, but they were dismissed by the Scottish Government as scaremongering.

'In the last few weeks we've seen just how volatile the price of oil really is.'
