Kingman has galloped into retirement with trainer John Gosden describing him as the best colt he has ever trained.

Plans for the four-time group one winner to have one final run in either the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on October 18 or in the Breeders’ Cup Mile on November 1 have been shelved because of ongoing treatment for a throat infection.

It scuppers of a possible dream showdown between Kingman and dual Derby winner Australia in the QE II Stakes.

Gosden, who had previously insisted his champion miler had the gears to dominate the sprint division, said: ‘He had a turbo charge that no other horse I've trained has possessed. He's the most exciting horse I've trained.

‘I trained Royal Heroine to win at the Breeders' Cup in a record time, and she was very good, but this boy would be in a different league.’

Kingman’s absence from the QE II Stakes could also have a significant bearing on the trainer’s title race.

Gosden leads Richard Hannon by over £250,000 and would have hoped to collect around £600,000 from a first place at Ascot with Kingman.

In the absence of the Khaled Abdullah-owned colt, Hannon will have the prize in his sights, perming his attack from a squad of Night Of Thunder, Olympic Glory and Toronado.

It was Night of Thunder who inflicted the only defeat on Kingman in six races this year when beating him half a length in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May.

Gosden couldn’t hide his frustration at the unsatisfactory result of a Classic turned into a tactical nightmare when the field split into two packs racing on either side of the Rowley Mile.

If anyone doubted whether James Doyle-ridden Kingman, who won seven of his eight career starts and £970,834, was the best miler of his generation, they were handed emphatic evidence when he romped to a five-length win in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and then avenged his Newmarket reverse by beating Night of Thunder two-and-a-quarter lengths in the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.

But arguably he was at his most visually impressive when leaving 2013 winner Toronado for dead in a slowly-run Sussex Stakes which turned into a two-furlong burn-up.

Kingman will stand at his owner’s Banstead Manor Stud alongside Frankel.
