Ahead of Barcelona's titanic tussle with Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday night, we look back at seven classic encounters between the Spanish giants and English teams. 

Leeds 2-1 Barcelona (Apr 1975) 

Fifty-thousand crammed into Elland Road to see the world’s most expensive player Johan Cruyff in action in the European Cup semi-final first leg. 

However, goals from Billy Bremner and Allan Clarke gave Leeds a lead to take to the Nou Camp, where a 1-1 draw saw them into the final.

Aston Villa 2-2 Barcelona (Mar 1978) 

Cruyff and Rafael Zuviria gave Barcelona a 2-0 lead at Villa Park in the UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg, but Villa refused to give up and Ken McNaught and John Deehan struck to salvage an impressive draw. Barcelona won the second leg 2-1. 

Newcastle 3-2 Barcelona (Sep 1997) 

Newcastle had a commanding lead over Louis van Gaal’s Super Cup holders within 50 minutes of their Champions League group match, thanks to a stunning hat-trick from Faustino Asprilla. Despite late goals from Luis Enrique and Luis Figo, the visitors slumped to a shock defeat.

Manchester Utd 3-3 Barcelona (Sep 1998) 

En route to their first Champions League title, Manchester United faced holders Barcelona in the group stage and quickly went 2-0 up through Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Barca fought back but a magnificent David Beckham free-kick made it 3-2, before Figo equalised from the spot.

Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (May 2009) 

The performance of referee Tom Henning Ovrebo soured this Champions League semi-final second leg, which saw Andres Iniesta’s late leveller send Barcelona through after Michael Essien had put Chelsea in front with a stunning volley.

Arsenal 2-2 Barcelona (Mar 2010) 

With Cesc Fabregas’ proposed move to Barca rumbling on in the background, tension was high between the clubs. Zlatan Ibrahimovic punished Arsenal’s backline twice in 13 minutes, but Theo Walcott turned the match. He scored and won a penalty, which Fabregas smashed home.

Manchester Utd 1-3 Barcelona (May 2011) 

Wembley hosted a repeat of the 2009 Champions League final, but United failed to make home advantage count. A fine finish from Wayne Rooney pulled them level after Pedro’s opener, but Pep Guardiola and his side hit back with second-half goals from Lionel Messi and David Villa to secure a fourth title.
