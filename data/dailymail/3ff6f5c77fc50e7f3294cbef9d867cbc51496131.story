David Moyes has threatened to find the dressing room mole at Real Sociedad and remove him from the club.

The former Manchester United and Everton manager is upset that his selected 11 appeared in the media last weekend before his team’s Sunday lunchtime game against Valenica.

In a press conference on Friday he said: ‘For some reason our team is in the newspapers [on the day of the game]. I don’t get the opposition team. I didn’t get Valencia’s team but the opposition get my team. I don’t think that’s right.

‘It doesn’t seem correct to me that our rivals find about our team selection because of leaks.’

When asked if a story circulating in San Sebastian that he has warned the players that if he finds one of his team has been leaking the team to the press he will make sure they leave the club, he replied: ‘Yes, correct!’

Moyes made several changes when he arrived at the Basque club last November, reducing the number of public training sessions in the lead up to match days and limiting daily injury updates because he believes it helps inform rivals.

He also prefers not to announce the squad for games on the Friday before a match – something that has not gone down well with some local reporters. Real Sociedad face Espanyol on Saturday.

Moyes said: ‘They have been in good form recently. But I hope we can use our good recent form at home.' 

In their last game at Anoeta Real Sociedad beat Sevilla 4-3 to solidify their position in mid-table.
