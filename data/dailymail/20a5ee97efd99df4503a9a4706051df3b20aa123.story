Graphic new footage of a thug being run over by a taxi driver and lying on the ground covered in blood has emerged.

The latest video shows a bloody Benoit Kapelli lying on the ground and clearly in shock after he was crushed under the wheels of a taxi he was attacking in Montreal.

It comes after the driver, 47-year-old Guercy Edmond, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault after the attack  on Sunday.

The new video shows one of the aggressive men, 22-year-old Benoit Kapelli, being crushed beneath the wheels of Edmond's Mercedes as he tried to escape.

Seconds earlier, Kapelli was kicking the side of the taxi as his friends jumped on the roof and surrounded the car following an apparent argument.

Kapelli emerges form under the car wide-eyed and clearly in shock as Edmond speeds off. The 22-year-old is in stable condition with serious head injuries - and may also be charged over the incident.

Edmond says he was acting in self defence and feared for his life when he accelerated to escape the gang.

Witnesses can be heard on the video shouting 'get out of there' as Edmond's car is attacked.

'For him, he was under attack,' Edmond's lawyer told the Montreal Gazette.

Crushed: Benoit's arm sticks out from beneath the wheel

'I haven’t seen the video but it seems to have circulated around. He is nervous. He didn’t understand why he (was arrested by the police). He feels like he was a victim, too.'

Police are now using the new footage and images taken from an earlier video, to try and determine what 
exactly happened when the man was run down by the car. 

Investigators
said the fight began when the taxi driver threw three men out of his 
cab around 4am in the lively Plateau district of Montreal.

The two-minute video shows people outside the cab yelling and throwing objects at the vehicle.

In shock: Benoit groans as he lies on the road

The fight quickly escalates when one man runs up and furiously kicks the cab.

The
car quickly spins round, narrowly missing the people in the street, and
moments later one man jumps onto the cab, runs the length of it then 
jumps off its hood when it begins to move.

The
vehicle swings around and runs over another of the men then quickly 
drives away disappearing down the street. The crowd are heard screaming 
on the video and rush round the man lying on the ground. 

The man who filmed the video is heard yelling: 'I told you guys to get out of there! Anyway, it's all on tape.'

Police are trying to determine what started the fight.

'We got numerous testimony from witnesses telling us different points of view,” Const. Daniel Lacoursière told CBC news.

Hit: The fight only ended when the taxi hit one of the men

Escape: While some men rushed to help the injured man others tried to run after the cab as it sped away
