Phil Jagielka will not turn his back on England after insisting he is ready to battle to reclaim his place in Roy Hodgson’s line-up.

Everton’s captain was scrutinised after England tumbled out of the World Cup and Hodgson looked at different defensive options during the recent games against Norway and Switzerland, though he did put Jagielka to close out a victory in Basel.

Jagielka has not looked to have talks with Hodgson about where he stands in the squad but he does accept that, on recent evidence, he has fallen behind Phil Jones and Chris Smalling in the pecking order to be Gary Cahill’s partner.

That, however, is not going to be a signal for him to end his career after winning 30 caps. Though he admitted the fallout from the World Cup was a difficult experience, Jagielka maintains his confidence has not been affected and is aiming to show Hodgson he can play a role going forward.

‘There is no point beating myself up about things,’ said Jagielka. ‘I want to play in winning teams and be a big part of a winning team, so there were some aspects I needed to sort out for myself. There are periods of a career where you feel you cannot do too much right.

‘After the game against Switzerland I was as happy as anyone else. I have not pushed my career as far as I can to get to the highest level just to spit my dummy out and say ‘I’m not going to come just because you’re not playing me’. I would like to play every game and play a big part of it.

‘It doesn’t feel nice (being dropped by England). That is the easiest way of saying it, but the manager has a job to do. If you look at building for the future that can work against me, but if you start looking too deeply at things it is not going to do me any favours.

‘I’m not going to demand reasons for not playing. What is there for me to speak to (Hodgson) about? A lot of people could do that for England. That is not what it is about. We are part of a team and if the manager makes a decision you stick by it. All I can do is my best.’

Before this season began, Jagielka said he would “not know for a month” whether the World Cup had left a scar. If his initial displays were scratchy – Everton conceded 10 times in their opening three games – his last two performances against West Brom and Wolfsburg have been much better.

‘I do not feel it has (left a mark),’ said Jagielka, whose side face Crystal Palace tomorrow. ‘It is an obvious assumption to make because it has not been great and could have been a lot better since. On a personal level I do not go around shouting about things.

‘I am sure I would not have been asked this if we had won the first three games of the season and kept clean sheets. I know I have to answer these questions. It has been a sticky four months but the players and coaching staff (at Everton) have been brilliant.

‘I do not think I have been horrific but when you look at the results I have been part of you can throw criticism my way and it is something I have to deal with.’
