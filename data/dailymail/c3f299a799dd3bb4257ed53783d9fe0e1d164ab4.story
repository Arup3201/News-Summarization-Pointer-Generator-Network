A Batman impersonator who was caught on CCTV handing in his friend to the police earlier this year has been spared jail today after being found guilty of burglary.

Stan Worby, 40, took Daniel Frayne, 27, to a Bradford police station in February to answer an arrest warrant issued over claims he tried to cash a stolen cheque.

Just like with the real Batman, the public wanted to unmask the hero - and father-of-five Worby was eventually identified.

But today Worby stood in the dock - minus his costume - to be sentenced for a burglary seven weeks later in which he and Frayne stole almost £800 worth of power tools from a garage.

This image of Worby handing over Daniel Frayne to police in Bradford, West Yorks, in February caught the public imagination - but seven weeks later they were both charged with stealing £800 worth of power tools from a garage

During a one-day trial last month, a jury at Bradford Crown Court found Worby guilty of burglary after hearing that just after 4am on April 14, police found him and Frayne in a silver Mondeo car 50 metres away from a garage that had been burgled.

Stashed in the boot was £770 worth of power tools including a drill set worth £150, three grinders worth between £50 and £80, a socket set worth £100 and a box of screwdrivers worth £40.

Worby claimed he knew nothing about the stolen goods, and that Frayne had piled them into his car  while en route to a car boot sale.

The jury took just half an hour to convict Worby, and Judge David Hatton QC handed him a six-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months.

He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours in unpaid work and pay an £80 victim surcharge.

The court heard that Worby had a 'lengthy record' which started at the juvenile courts, and included burglaries, battery, drug offences and motoring offences.

He was given a suspended jail term in 2010 for possession with intent to supply cannabis, and last appeared before courts in September 2011 where he was given an absolute discharge for depositing environmental waste.

Mitigating, Simon Hustler said that Worby had been employed at the time of the burglary by Kirklees Council but was let go from this job after a local paper printed the story of the burglary on their front page.

Judge Hatton told Worby: 'You have committed no offences of burglary or attempted burglary for 13 years.

'That is what prevents you going to prison immediately.

'The offence is so serious that it passes the custody threshold, but I impose a sentence of six months' imprisonment suspended for 12 months.'

Frayne was previously sentenced to eight months in prison for burglary, handling stolen goods and breach of a community order.
