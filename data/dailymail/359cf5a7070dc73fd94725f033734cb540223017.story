Arsenal midfielder Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain claims the club's core for England is a great asset for the national side.

Oxlade-Chamberlain played alongside four fellow Arsenal team-mates as England cruised past San Marino 5-0 in the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Thursday.

Calum Chambers, Kieran Gibbs, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck all started with Chambers making his full England debut and Welbeck scoring the third goal during the rout.

Theo Walcott has returned to full training at Arsenal. Therefore England could soon field up to six Gunners in one match.

Oxlade-Chamberlain believes such a core can only be a positive for both England and Arsene Wenger's side.

'Being at Arsenal I've felt that [English] presence around our dressing room and to be able to come away with England with so many of your team-mates is a really nice feeling,' said Oxlade-Chamberlain.

'I think it's really good for England and I think it's nice for Arsenal as a club and the fans and we've still got Theo Walcott to come back. We can't count him out because I'm sure he'll be back in the squad.'

Arsenal's defender Calum Chambers made his full international debut, having featured against Norway last month. The 19-year-old was clearly delighted, playing the full 90 minutes.

'I really enjoyed it,' Chambers said. 'It's an honour for me to play for my country and especially get a start, and we put in a performance and got a win, which is good.

Gunners midfielder Jack Wilshere put in another impressive performance as England cruised to a 5-0 win

Left-back Kieran Gibbs took his rare starting spot with a solid performance, alongside four other Gunners

'The first half they were tough to break down and it was a bit frustrating but we kept doing the things we wanted to do and eventually it paid off and we got the goals we wanted.' 

Next up for Roy Hodgson's side is an away trip to Estonia in their next Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday.
