Trendy grandfather Allan Bradbury is still a 'dedic-aged' follower of fashion - at the age of 70.

The former construction worker may have his bus pass and is entitled to 20 per cent discounts in DIY stores and garden centres - but he spends up to £160 a month on Gucci and Vivienne Westwood designs, including oversized shirts and funky pirate boots.

Mr Bradbury, from Bolton, who has two wardrobes at home to house his giant collection of flamboyant designer gear, is refusing to grow old gracefully. As a result, he says he regularly gets stopped in the street by onlookers admiring his quirky fashion sense.

Allan has vowed never to give into 'old man' slacks and woolly jumpers, no matter how old he is

The former RAF gunner who served the 15th squadron’s parachute team in Borneo, Asia, warned he would never give up his favourite ripped jeans for conventional ‘old man’ jumpers, no matter how old he is.

'Anyone who suggests I wear slacks and a beige shirt can wash out their mouth with soap and water as far as I’m concerned,' said the divorced father-of-four, from Bolton, Greater Manchester.

'I’ve always been a follower of fashion and I’m not going to stop now just because I’m in my 70s. When I left school at the age of 15 I was a Teddy Boy and I thought I was a bit of looker back then.

'Then in the 1970s I loved the whole Flower Power theme and in the Eighties I wore a lot of leather. My fashion sense has evolved with the decades.

Allan's funky dress sense has caught the eye of exclusive fashion house Vivienne Westwood, which invited him to a tea party at the Manchester store to preview the new season's collection

'Fashion is an expression of people’s personalities and I don’t think that should stop just because you have reached a certain age.'

Amongst his collection of designer jackets, trousers and shoes in his walk-in wardrobe, Mr Bradbury boasts a section dedicated to his favourite fashion label Vivienne Westwood.

The world-famous designer is known for her daring and off-the-cuff designs, and is favoured by celebrities such as Dita Von Teese and Kate Moss.

But the fashion house was so impressed with Mr Bradbury, it invited him to a tea party at the Manchester store when the new season’s collection was unveiled.

He added: 'I discovered Vivienne Westwood about eight years ago and that’s when my obsession started. I love her designs, they’re asymmetric and she doesn’t follow the rules or conform. I love that about her.

'I buy her clothes whenever I can, and staff in the Manchester store now know me really well - they give me a hug when they see me.'

Mr Bradbury who currently volunteers as a counsellor admits his style is far from conventional and said his love of Vivienne Westwood took a while for his children, Tracy, 40, Lee, 40, Alaine, 31, and Christopher, 27 and granddaughter Jade, 22, to get used to.

He said: 'When I first started wearing 
Vivienne Westwood clothes my children would tell me to walk on the other
 side of the road but they’re used to it now.

Vivienne Westwood, beloved by the likes of Kate Moss (pictured with her left) is Allan's favorite designer,

'I get so many people coming up to me in the street and saying things like "I love you for having courage. You’re old but you still have a love of fashion". I guess I do like the attention. I have been called the "OAP fashion icon".

'So many people stop me for photographs but some young men do judge me. I get called "gayboy" because I wear pirate boots and an oversized shirt, but I’m not bothered. I like my style and that’s the main thing.

'I will absolutely, definitely not ever wear plain trousers and beige shirts and jumpers. My favourite outfit is combat ripped jeans with red pocket linings, a Vivienne Westwood shirt with gold glitter on the cuffs and a Union Jack on the neck. I dress loud and colourful - I guess I’m a bit of a show off.

'Age is just a number, it is nothing to do with fashion. It was Vivienne Westwood who said buy less but buy well.

'Nelson Mandela said we should not be subservient, but to shine, therefore we give people the opportunity to do the same, and I believe in that philosophy.'
