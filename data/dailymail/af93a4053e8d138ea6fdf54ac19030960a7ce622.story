The wife and daughter of a man who were found guilty of his murder and dubbed the 'lady killers' have had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal. 

Shirley and Lynette Banfield argued there was no evidence retired bookmaker, Don Banfield, who was last seen in 2001, was even dead and that he could be among the 2,000 people-a-year who disappear. 

Three of the country’s top judges today agreed with their lawyers that - with no body, no suggested mechanism of death and no indication even of the date when Mr Banfield was allegedly killed - his wife and daughter simply had ‘no case to answer’.

The jury’s murder verdict was quashed and the women will not face a retrial.

Shirley, 65, was last year found guilty by a jury at London’s Old Bailey of enlisting her 42-year-old daughter’s help to kill with Mr Banfield, 63, and profit from his death.

Mr Banfield, from Wealdstone, in north-west London, who was reputed to be a heavy gambler and womaniser, had recently retired when he disappeared.

After completing the contract for the sale of his home for £179,000 in May 2001, he was never seen again. 

Crown lawyers argued the mother and daughter had a financial motive and acted 'in concert' to dispose of Mr Banfield. 

Never found: Don Banfield disappeared more than a decade ago

The jury found both women, who lived together in Thanington, near Canterbury, guilty of murder by a 10-1 majority in April last year.

The pair, who had earlier admitted fraud offences in relation to the plundering of Mr Banfield’s £64,000 pension fund, were each jailed for life.

However William Clegg QC, for Shirley Banfield, told London’s Criminal Appeal Court it had not even been proved that Mr Banfield was dead.

He said: 'The evidence proved that Don Banfield disppeared over the week-end 12/13th May 2001. 

'The Crown did not suggest when, where or how he was killed, who was present, the mechanism of death or what happened to the body.'

He added: 'Two hundred thousand people disappear each year and 2,000 of those are not heard from again. Don Banfield could have been one of those 2,000.'

Overturning the women’s murder convictions, Lady Justice Rafferty said: 'This was an alleged joint enterprise murder with no body, no suggested mechanism of death, no identified day when the murder was said to have occurred, no time and no place and no suggestion of what happened to the body.'

Although Mr Clegg had accepted that the likelihood was that 'one or other' of the women killed Mr Banfield, the judge said there was simply no evidence on which any rational jury could conclude that they had acted together to kill him. 

Crown lawyers argued the woman had both the opportunity and motive for murder, but the judge emphasised: 'Suspicion without more does not equate to proof'.

One woman might have had trouble killing Mr Banfield single-handed and disposing of his body. But the judge, sitting with Mr Justice Simon and Mrs Justice Carr, said: 'The courts regularly see proved allegations of homicide against a woman acting alone'.

The judge ruled: 'The submission of no case to answer should have been allowed. These appeals will be allowed and both convictions will be quashed'.

She added: 'For the most evident of reasons there could be no question of a retrial'.
