Back in jail: Joseph Green Brown, 62, is being held over the murder of his wife Mamie in North Carolina last week after he was released from death row in 1987

A former death row inmate who became a spokesman against the death penalty has been arrested again over the alleged murder of his wife.

Joseph Brown was held after Mamie, his wife of 20 years, was found dead in her apartment on Thursday.

He now faces the death penalty for the second time if convicted of the crime which has left both their families in shock.

Officers found the 71-year-old woman lying on the floor suffering from apparent trauma.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Brown was released from death row in 1987 for a wrongful rape and murder conviction and spent his life campaigning for reform of the penal system.

He found God, took the name Shabaka and frequently spoke out against the finality of the death penalty, including a passionate speech to a Congressional Judiciary subcommittee.

Prominent lawyers involved in his case also changed their minds about capital punishment due to his pleas.

In one interview Brown said: ‘I’m against killing, period, whether the violence is by individuals, the state, or armies in warfare. All life is sacred.’

The body of Mrs Brown, 71, was discovered after police were asked to check on her. Her husband was arrested late on Friday at a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina.

Discovery: Mamie Brown, 71, was found dead at her apartment in North Carolina after having suffered trauma, according to police

During his first court appearance in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, he was escorted into a courtroom in 
handcuffs. Wearing an orange prison jump suit, he glimpsed at his wife’s
family in the courtroom, but quickly turned away.

A daughter of the victim could be heard saying: ‘Oh my god!’

Marcus Williams, Mrs Brown’s cousin, 
said: ‘We thought they were happy. He didn’t seem like a threat. He was 
upfront about everything. He was always smiling and trying to help 
people.'

Mr Williams added: ‘He was a motivational speaker. He liked to warn people what could happen in the legal system’.

Brown’s 1974 conviction and death 
sentence by a Florida jury was for raping and murdering Earlene Treva 
Barksdale, the owner of a clothing store.

He was scheduled for execution October  17, 1983, but a federal judge ordered a stay 15 hours before he was to be put to death.

Mrs Barksdale, 34, a mother of five, 
was found shot in the head at the children's clothing store she owned on
July 7, 1973 by her husband Fred, according to an article by Cltampa.com

Her
husband was considered the prime suspect for around five days before he
passed a lie detector test and attention shifted to Joseph Brown.

Brown, at the time a 23-year-old 
drifter from South Carolina, had just confessed to a motel robbery where
he sexually abused a female guest near Tampa airport on the same 
day. He denied knowing anything about Mrs Barksdale's death.

Brown was convicted of her murder the 
following year and spent 13 years on death row before charges were 
dropped just 15 hours before his execution.

He was released on March 5, 1987 after an appeals court found that prosecution had allowed testimony at trial they knew to be false. 

One witness had struck a deal with the prosecution and falsely told the court that he and Brown had committed a robbery together.

In a 1997 interview with America magazine about his experiences on death row, Brown said: 'Overall, it took me almost five years to decompress from the experience on death row.

'Some people couldn't believe I was still alive.'

Among those who campaigned for Brown the first time around was Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut based lawyer who is now a Senator for the state.

He worked the case pro bono and even put in $40,000 of his own money - despite supporting the death penalty.

He declined to comment on Brown’s latest arrest.

Some $400,000 of money for Brown’s defence was also provided by black rights campaigners the NAACP because they believed it was a racially-linked injustice.

North Carolina, where Brown will face justice this time, has the death penalty for capitol felonies, of which first degree murder is one.

The last execution in the state was Samuel Flippen in 2006 who beat his two-year-old stepdaughter to death.
