Demonstrators protesting against the Ukrainian government have accused authorities of sending them a sinister text message direct to their phones in an attempt to intimidate opponents.

Activist on the streets of Kiev received a text message warning them: 'Dear subscriber, you are registered as a participant in a mass disturbance.'

The message, sent to people who had gathered at a focal point for anti-government rallies, came as a law making it illegal to take part in almost all forms of protest in the ex-Soviet country came into force.

Campaigners claim this proves the state is employing Orwellian methods to monitor protesters' every move in an attempt to disrupt opposition efforts.

They fear the use of tracking 
technology could mean the government will be able to target individual 
opponents based on their phone records.

Kiev broadcaster Radio Liberty was on the scene when one of the demonstrators received the text message.

The ominous new development came as the death toll during violent clashed 
with riot police is thought to have risen in fierce clashes with
 police.

Protesters shouted 
'Murderers!' and 'Glory to Ukraine!' in a square in the centre of the 
capital Kiev after reports spread that a man had been shot dead by a 
police sniper and that another demonstrator had fallen to his death 
during the violence.

This
 was not immediately confirmed by the Ukrainian authorities, but a 
Reuters cameraman was shown the body of a man identified as a protester 
who had gunshot wounds to the head - three other protesters were 
confirmed dead from earlier clashes.

The latest violence broke out when police, using teargas, tried to dismantle a protest camp but were repelled by demonstrators hurling home-made petrol bombs, witnesses said.

Armed police 
in riot gear arranged themselves into military-style formations and 
protesters brandished guns and baseball bats as the situation in Kiev 
got out of control.

It 
came as a shocking video emerged of a man having his hand blown off in 
the capital by a stun grenade. It shows the grenade going off before 
protesters attending to an injured man whose hand is ripped to shreds 
while blood spurts from his wrist.

Meanwhile,
 Oleh Musiy, coordinator of the medical corps for the anti-government 
protesters, said one activist died this morning in the hospital after 
falling from a high altitude at the site of the clashes.

Musiy suggested two other protesters died after being shot.

Violent clashes between protesters 
and security forces have continued as Russia warned the fraught 
situation was 'getting out of control'.

Shocking
 images from the capital Kiev show police officers covered in flames 
after being hit by petrol bombs, thrown by pro-EU demonstrators in a 
conflict which has wounded hundreds of people.

Security forces have responded by using stun grenades, rubber bullets and tear gas against the protesters.

Clashes continued through the morning
 as officers blocking access to the Verkhovna Rada parliament buildings 
were confronted by thousands of protesters banging sticks on metal 
cannisters.

Some reports 
say that demonstrators had built a giant catapult behind a barricade of 
burned-out vehicles to hurl projectiles at police. There have also been 
claims of opposition forces using lasers to blind officers.

Government sources said that at least 163 members of the security forces had been wounded, and 80 hospitalised.

The stand-off has brought tensions between protesters and the authorities to a new high after two months of rallies over the government abandoning a pact for closer ties with the EU.

New set of laws, which ban nearly all forms of protest in the ex-Soviet country and have enraged demonstrators, were officially published today, and are set to come into force at midnight.

The laws, set out in the wake of warnings from President Viktor Yanukovych that the violence threatened the entire country, allow for jail terms of up to 
five years for those who blockade public buildings. They also set out provisions to arrest protesters wearing masks or helmets.

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov stepped into the row after calls from opposition leaders failed to calm the situation.

Russian police are hunting three women suspected of preparing for suicide bomb attacks, with one thought to be hiding in the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi.

So-called ‘black widows’ – the wives of slain Islamic militants – have been blamed for recent suicide attacks in the country which left dozens dead.

Islamic groups have already threatened to strike during the Games, which begin on February 7.

Police have warned the public to be on the lookout for three women trained ‘to perpetrate acts of terrorism’, with Ruzanna Ibragimova, 22, believed to be at large in Sochi.

It is not known where the others are hiding.

Russia has mounted an intense security operation around Olympic venues, but there is concern that ‘soft targets’ – such as buses and tourist facilities – are vulnerable to attack.

He said: 'They show that the situation is getting out of control', describing the situation as an 'absolute violation of all European norms of behaviour'.

He also slammed the EU's 'indecent' support of the protest movement against Yanukovych.

On Tuesday, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay called the situation in Ukraine 'very worrying' and said the government should suspend the controversial anti-protest laws.

The clashes follow two months of protests, and are thought to have involved some 10,000 demonstrators.

It was not immediately clear how many protesters were injured as many were afraid to seek medical help on fears of getting arrested, but activists said hundreds were hurt.

At least 35 journalists were hurt in the clashes and some received injuries to their faces and eyes from rubber bullets, Ukrainian press freedom group the Institute of Mass Information said.

The interior ministry said 50 activists had been arrested as part of an investigation for mass rioting.

The opposition led by three politicians including former world boxing champion Vitali Klitschko said it was ready for dialogue but stressed it wanted to hold talks with Yanukovych, not his aides.

Klitschko went to the presidential administration in Kiev for a meeting with Yanukovych but left after being told the president was too busy to receive him, his party said.

Opposition leaders appeared unable to have any influence on the hard core of radical protesters and stopped short of supporting their actions.

But Ukraine's jailed former prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko came out in support of those clashing with police, saying she would be with them if she could.

And today opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who had previously condemned violent protests, said the situation has changed.

'People have received the right to switch from peaceful to non-peaceful protest because the deafness of the authorities and their disregard for the people,' he said.
