It had to be perfect. Jonny Wilkinson played his last game of professional rugby on UK soil by producing a masterclass of goal-kicking that rolled back the years and crushed Saracens’ dreams.

Wilkinson, the greatest points machine in English rugby history, ensured the money-men from the Cote d’Azur defended their title with crushing efficiency that will hurt the London club every bit as much as their semi-final defeat last year by the same side.

In truth, they were never really at 
the races as Toulon’s galacticos showed they are more than just a 
collection of big names on the team-sheet by crushing, squeezing and 
then stabbing Saracens with two rapier thrusts either side of half-time.

In
 the end they simply had too much class for a Saracens team who 
obliterated Clermont in the semi-final a fortnight ago but simply could 
not gain physical dominance over a Toulon side full of world-class 
quality.

Last week Saracens 
director of rugby Mark McCall described Toulon as being capable of 
playing with opponents ‘like a cat plays with a mouse’ and this morning 
he knows just how it feels to be the victim of their feline control.

Every
 time they attempted to attack they were smothered and thumped to the 
floor while every time they made an error, Wilkinson was there to punish
 them with a flawless goal-kicking display.

Where have we heard that before?

The
 iconic World Cup winner will play his final game of professional rugby 
next Saturday when Toulon take on Castres in the Top 14 final and it 
would be a fool who bet against him ending his career with yet another 
piece of silverware.

His 
fast-twitch fibres may not be quite as sharp as they once were but his 
goal-kicking is as deadly as ever. Saracens knew it, but could do 
nothing about it.

‘There’s a
 lot of relief and excitement at the moment,’ Wilkinson said. ‘At the 
moment I’m just trying to take it all in. Everything comes from all the 
hard work of the team and that goes for Saracens as well. I couldn’t 
have asked for more.’

On point: Toulon captain Wilkinson had a 100% success rate as he contributed 13 points in their win

The 
north London club must now pick themselves up and somehow muster the 
emotional energy to beat Northampton in next Saturday’s Aviva 
Premiership final.

They are 
unquestionably the best side in England and it would be cruel if they 
ended the season trophyless again. But it will be a huge ask to regroup 
in time to beat a Northampton side buoyed by their Amlin Challenge Cup 
triumph over Bath on Friday night.

On Saturday they simply could not find a way through Toulon’s brick wall rush defence.
