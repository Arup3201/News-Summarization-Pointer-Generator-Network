The top half of the Premier League table shows just how close the race for a place in the top four is

The race for the Champions League is shaping up to be the most tense in years. With Chelsea and Manchester City in a two-way fight for the Barclays Premier League title, five teams are battling it out for the remaining two spots in the coveted top four.

Just three points separate Southampton in third spot and Liverpool in seventh, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham jostling in between.

The riches of Europe's elite competition await the lucky two clubs who claim their places in the top four. With just over a third of the season to go, Sportsmail analyses the contenders' strengths and weaknesses... but who do you think will win the race? 

SOUTHAMPTON

REASONS THEY WILL MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Their mean defence. The Saints have conceded just 17 Premier League goals this season - the best defensive record in the top flight. Ronald Koeman has got his back-four, led by skipper Jose Fonte, well drilled. If they score, the likelihood is that Southampton leave with the points. 

REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR

The lack of experience. Koeman has assembled a young and vibrant squad down at St Mary's. But when it comes to the crunch do they have the knowhow and mettle to go the distance? We don't know the answer because we've not seen them in this position. But we're about to find out. 

Despite failing to keep this Nedum Onuoha effort out, Jose Fonte has marshalled the league's best defence

ARSENAL

REASONS THEY WILL MAKE THE TOP FOUR

They've been there, seen it, done it, got all the memorabilia. Arsene Wenger's side are masters at timing their run perfectly to ensure they finish in the top four. So many times we've questioned their Champions League qualification credentials. They've not buckled, yet...

REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Their injuries. With a fully-fit squad at his disposal, Wenger has a team to challenge England and Europe's best. But his season has been beset by injuries to key men. And with doubts now over Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey following the win over Leicester, could this be the year they miss out? 

Arsene Wenger may have shot himself in the foot by rushing Alexis Sanchez back from injury too quickly

MANCHESTER UNITED

REASONS THEY WILL MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Their firepower. Admittedly, it hasn't clicked for Louis van Gaal in the attacking third - but if it does they'll walk into the top four. Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao. Is there a better forward line in the continent? 

REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Their inconsistencies. It's been a stop-start season for United. Just when you think they're are on a run, they falter. It's been a transitional season for Van Gaal, an injury-hit one at that, but if they continue to stop-start then they could be facing a second successive season out of Europe's elite club competition. 

There are still bi question marks over Manchester United's team, such as where Wayne Rooney should play

The sight of Radamel Falcao celebrating a goal has been all too rare for United fans during a difficult season

TOTTENHAM

REASONS THEY WILL MAKE THE TOP FOUR

The striker the supporters call 'one of their own'. In short, Harry Kane has been a revelation for Spurs this season. Goal after goal after goal. It's 23 for the season and surely an England debut is on the horizon for the striker. If he stays in top form, Spurs can make a real fist of making the top-four. 

REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Their leaky defence. Mauricio Pochettino has struggled to find a settled back four this season and it shows. Spurs have conceded 34 league goals so far this season - only five clubs in the Premier League have shipped more. Pochettino must find a solution or Spurs will miss out again.

LIVERPOOL

REASONS THEY WILL MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Momentum. Liverpool have got the wind in their sails at the moment; reminiscent of last season's blistering finish to the season that saw them just miss out on the title. With Daniel Sturridge back fit and Raheem Sterling fully-charged after his winter break to Jamaica, the Reds are on a roll.

REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR

Their poor start to the season means Liverpool must have a virtually faultless end to the season in order to break into the Champions League places. Even with their momentum, you fear they've left themselves too much to do. And with their FA Cup run - could they take their eyes off the prize? 

Daniel Sturridge's return from injury could be the spark Liverpool need to make the top four
