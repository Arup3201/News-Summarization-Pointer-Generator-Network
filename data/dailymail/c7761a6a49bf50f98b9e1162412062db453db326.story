Politics has always been cause for heated debates and flaring tempers, but a recent session in the Georgian parliament went a bit further than wagging fingers and insults.

MPs from both the majority Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party and the opposition came to blows in the Georgian parliament during a debate on Ukraine's European integration.

Vice-speaker Giorgi Baramidze was addressing plans to encourage supporters of Ukraine’s decision when government officials began talking with their fists.

Battling it out: MPs from both the majority and opposition came to blows in the Georgian parliament

Mr Baramidze has just condemned the 
recent violence during protests in Kiev, when MPs threw paperwork in the
air and attacked each other with punches and kicks.

Video
footage from inside the parliament session shows documents flying into 
the air as politicians get out of their seats following the opposition’s 
suggestion they work to find a solution with Ukraine.

Members of the opposition are now refusing to participate in plenary meetings until they get a public apology from the majority party.

No one was seriously injured in the incident, which took place earlier this week.

Order, order: After several members of the Georgian parliament sent papers flying in the air, the debate got physical

It
is somewhat ironic that the Georgian MPs started fighting over Ukraine,
where the parliament has seen several physical fights during sessions 
in the past years.

In 2010, a
'debate' in the Ukraine parliament sent six lawmakers to hospital with 
concussions, a fractured jaw and multiple bruises.

Earlier the same 
year, smoke bombs and eggs were thrown as parliament agreed on a trade 
deal with Russia.

Last year,
a Kiev politician was left with blood streaming down his face after 
violence broke out over a bill that would allow the use of the Russian 
language in courts, hospitals and other institutions in the 
Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine.

Heated argument: One member of parliament can be seen grabbing the face of another in the video, as others try to go in between the combatants

Pulled apart: Several MPs had to be told to use their words instead of their fists after the parliamentary debate
