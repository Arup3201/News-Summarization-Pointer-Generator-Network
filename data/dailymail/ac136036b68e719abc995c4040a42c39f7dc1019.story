Quit: Nebraska Lt. Gov. Rick Sheehy, pictured, resigned his post abruptly on Saturday after questions were raised about improper cell phone calls he'd made to four women

Nebraska's Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy has abruptly resigned after it emerged he'd made thousands of improper calls to women late at night on his state-issued cellphone.

Governor Dave Heineman announced the departure at a hastily scheduled news conference this morning and said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the revelations about the 53-year-old who he was grooming to succeed him in office.

Sheehy quit after the Omaha World-Herald obtained public records that detailed some  2,000 improper cellphone calls he had made to four women who were not his wife over the past four years.

'I've got a knot in my stomach. I'm deeply disappointed,' Heineman told reporters.

He confirmed Sheehy's resignation followed disclosures made in a public records request but declined to discuss what those disclosures were.

Henieman did, however, note that the resignation involved 'personal decisions' made by his lieutenant governor. 

'I had trusted him, and that trust was broken,' he said, adding that the whole thing had happened 'very, very rapidly.'

It is unclear what the nature of the calls was or who the women are. The World-Herald said many of the calls were long conversations held in the early hours.

Last July, Sheehy's wife, Connie Sheehy, filed for divorce after nearly 29 years of marriage. Her divorce filing stated the 'marriage of the parties is irretrievably broken.'

Sheehy, a Republican, had been considered the front-runner in the 2014 gubernatorial race and had been endorsed by Heineman. He has been traveling throughout the state, making speeches and holding public events.

Sheehy was the mayor of Hastings before Heineman selected him as his running mate. They were elected by a record margin to their first full term in 2006 and re-elected in 2010.

Heineman said he doubted Sheehy would run for the governor's office now. 'And no, I would not support him under the circumstances,' Heineman said.

Sheehy
did not appear at the news conference, and Heineman declined to answer 
questions about what had occurred that led Sheehy to resign.

'You'll have to ask him about that,' Heineman told reporters. Sheehy's office failed to answer calls from the Associated Press.

The governor would not say whether he asked Sheehy to resign or if Sheehy acted on his own. But he said: 'As public officials, we're held to a higher standard. Rightly so.'

Heineman said he will begin the process Monday of looking for a new lieutenant governor, and will appoint someone in the coming weeks.

If something were to happen to Heineman before he selects a new lieutenant governor, Speaker of the Legislature Greg Adams would ascend to the governor's post.

Sheehy's announcement shakes up an already turbulent 2014 governor's race. Another Republican candidate, former Nebraska Speaker of the Legislature Mike Flood, entered the race briefly but withdrew in December after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Several Democratic candidates have signaled an interest in running, a list that includes University of Nebraska Regent Chuck Hassebrook and Nebraska state Sen. Steve Lathrop of Omaha. In recent weeks, party activists have also approached state Sen. Annette Dubas, of Fullerton.

'We're going to have a very strong candidate in 2014,' said Vince Powers, chairman of the Nebraska Democratic Party.

'This doesn't change anything, other than it really demonstrates that when you have one party in power for too long, arrogance and corruption and scandal follow it. It doesn't matter if it's Democrats in power or Republicans in power.'

In an email to the Associated Press, Hassebrook said he is 'taking a hard look' at running for governor in 2014.

'I recognize that no human is without failing. So I wish Rick Sheehy and his family the best as they seek to heal from this disappointing episode,' he said.

Sheehy changed his Twitter account settings to private before Heineman's press conference. Shortly after, his account appeared to have been deleted.
