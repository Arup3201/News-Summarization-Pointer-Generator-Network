Allegations: Tennis coach Daniel Erik Hubbard-Wilson, 27 is said to have sexually assaulted a 15-year-old player on a school team

A former high school tennis coach has been arrested after allegedly having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old member of the varsity team he was 'obsessed with'. 

Daniel Erik Hubbard-Wilson, 27 from St. Paul, Minnesota, is said to have 'fallen in love' with the girl, who is now 16, forcing her father to take out a restraining order on him. 

He is said to have assaulted the girl numerous times from September 2013 at the Convent of the Visitation High School in Mendota Heights.

According to the Star Tribune the allegations were uncovered when the girl's father confronted her about the relationship a year later. 

In a bid to protect himself, Hubbard-Wilson is believed to have sent the girl's father a text message that read: 'I fell in love with her so tremendously and I never should have at this time. I made decisions I absolutely never should have at this time. 

'But please, my whole life would be destroyed, registering, probation, doing time, I have two sisters I love dearly that I could never see, I could never get a job or move on and go back to grad school. 

'I feel terrible and I desperately wanted chance to reinvent myself learning from my mistake.' 

The complaint published said Hubbard-Wilson was subsequently interviewed by police. 

He asked for an attorney and the interview was terminated, but Hubbard-Wilson then said, 'I love her, and I know I can't get into much else, but … I … I did, and …' 

Chris Madel, an attorney for the girl's family, said that the victim will soon be 17 and was 15 when the alleged misconduct began.

'The family is shocked, dismayed and doing their best to work through this difficult time,' Madel said.

In a written statement to the Star Tribune, Dawn Nichols, the Head of School, said that Wilson resigned 'citing family reasons.'

'He had been suspended on September 23 after concerns were raised about an inappropriate relationship with a minor,' Nichols said in the statement. 'Visitation School holds the safety and health of its students as its highest priority, and will continue to cooperate fully with authorities.' 

Hubbard-Wilson has been charged with first degree criminal sexual misconduct and third degree criminal misconduct, both felonies, in Ramsey County District Court. 

First degree is commonly referred to as rape.

He was booked into Ramsey County Jail and his bail has been set at $20,000. He was also told not to have any contact with his victim or females under the age of 16. 

It is understood that the victim also informed authorities about other students Hubbard-Wilson may have had relationships with, 

Sgt. Paul Cottingham, a sex crimes investigator with the St. Paul Police Department, said the investigation into Hubbard-Wilson's activities will expand.

'It's our belief that there are more victims, however, we don't have much information to go on,' Cottingham said.
