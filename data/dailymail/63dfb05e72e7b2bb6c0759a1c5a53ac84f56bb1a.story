Rival agents have again raised concerns about Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock’s son working for a football agency that has close links with Selhurst Park.

James Warnock acts as football consultant for Unique Sports Management run by Will Salthouse whose clients include Palace players Wilfried Zaha, on loan from Manchester United, and Damien Delaney — sent off against Chelsea last weekend. 

Warnock Jnr was also the subject of the same conflict of interest issue when he worked for Hayden Evans’s HN Sports who did deals with Warnock when he was boss at QPR.

Salthouse said: ‘I was working with Palace long before Neil Warnock became manager and my close connections are with the chairman Steve Parish who negotiates the transfers rather than Neil. Obviously if there is any work between us and the Palace manager, James would not be involved in any way.’

Football managers with sons working as agents has been a controversial subject since the furore surrounding the Manchester United transfer business handled by Jason Ferguson.

Minister of Sport Helen Grant has finally made a decent contribution to football governance with the setting up of the Supporter Ownership and Engagement Expert group to explore ways fans can have more involvement in the running of clubs.

The choice of independent chairperson for a group with representatives from Government, Supporters Direct, the three main football bodies as well as clubs run by fans is also a good one for a change as Joanna Manning-Cooper, director of marketing and communications for ER2015, is a proper football supporter who knows what she’s talking about.

The MCC golf society, the biggest of its kind in the country, has just published its extensive fixture list for 2015 which contains approaching 100 golf days and matches. 

With such interest in golf at Lord’s, it seems extraordinary that the Ashes Test there next summer and the Open Championship are clashing again for the third Ashes tour in a row. MCC say their main priority is starting a Test on a Thursday and ECB are responsible for the international calendar.

Sports editor Bruce Millington and Alan Byrne, CEO of troubled trade paper the Racing Post, were taken by helicopter to Newmarket races for lunch with Qatar’s Sheik Fahad, who is said to have major issues with the newspaper’s downbeat build-up to Ascot’s Champions Day sponsored by Fahad’s QIPCO investment company. 

Millington said the Post’s coverage was discussed but there was nothing unusual. Meanwhile, the Post are effectively boycotting the running of their flagship sponsored race at Doncaster next Saturday because of the row over the hugely increased cost of racing data that involves racetrack owners Arena Racing Company. The Post’s duty reporter may even present the trophy.

Work takes place on the roof at the Olympic Stadium, which is expected to exceed budget by £50m

It is going to cost around £50million more than expected to refurbish the Olympic Stadium for tenants West Ham because of the complexity of fitting the new roof. Builders Balfour Beatty, being paid £154m to convert the stadium, are in talks with the London Legacy Development Company about increasing their fee to as much as £200m because of the extra work involved.

The steel rods holding up the cantilever roof have had to be strengthened in a highly technical and costly process only previously done on North Sea oil rigs. The terms of West Ham’s 99-year tenancy from the 2016-17 season ensures conversion costs are met by LLDC, who will have to find the extra money from the contingency budget for Olympic Park construction projects.

An LLDC spokesperson said: ‘This is a complex project and there are always on-going discussions about specific elements within it.’

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino was said to be behind the decision not to start Adryan against Rotherham

The word inside Elland Road is that Adryan was due to start at Rotherham — where Leeds lost 2-1 — until shortly before kick-off when he was replaced by Lewis Cook. Owner Masimo Cellino, absent on October 17 — his unlucky number — is said to be responsible.

Mal Brannigan, managing director of Sheffield United, is understood to have made it clear to club employees that anyone found discussing the Ched Evans rape case with the media could lose their job.
