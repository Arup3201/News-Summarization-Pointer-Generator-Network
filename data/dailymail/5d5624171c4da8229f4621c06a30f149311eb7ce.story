A mother passed drugs to her son in prison by giving him a French kiss, it was alleged today.

Kimberly Margeson, 54, transferred two strong painkiller pills from her mouth to William Partridge's mouth while visiting him in a New York jail, prosecutors claim.

Police did not indicate whether tongues were involved in the alleged exchange on Tuesday last week.

According to a Yates County Sheriff's Department report, Margeson put the Oxycodone pills into her mouth and brought them into the jail when she visited her son, who was being held after a weapons arrest.

She then passed two pills 'from her mouth to her son's mouth when she kissed him,' the report said.

The drugs were intended for Partridgeâ€™s personal use and not resale, it was reported by The Smoking Gun.

Margeson reportedly smuggled two pills of Oxycodone (above, file picture), a painkiller similar to morphine

Margeson was arrested and charged with a felony drug count and a misdemeanor count of promoting prison contraband.

She pleaded not guilty to the two charges in Town Court and was released on a $2,000 bail.

Partridge, 30, who remains jailed, was charged with a misdemeanor count of promoting prison contraband and will be arraigned on Monday.

Oxycodone is an opioid narcotic pain reliever similar to morphine which is used to treat moderate to severe pain.
