Mauricio Pochettino claims he will not make a final decision on his new Tottenham captain until the transfer window has closed.

The Spurs armband is up for grabs since Michael Dawson completed a transfer to Hull City this week after 324 appearances in nine years in North London.

Younes Kaboul has been leading Pochettino's team out in the Barclays Premier League this season and Hugo Lloris was skipper in the first leg of the Europa League play-off against AEL Limassol, last week.

Taking his time: Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino will not rush to appoint a new captain

Lloris is expected to lead them out in the return against AEL tomorrow(THU) but the Tottenham boss still hopes to make more signings before the transfer market closes on Monday, including centre-half Federico Fazio from Sevilla.

'We will decide about the captain in the next few days,' said Pochettino. 'When the transfer window is closes. It is important that we have many leaders in the group. It has been Younes and Hugo and maybe Hugo tomorrow, or another player.'

He refused to comment on the move to sign fellow Argentine Fazio, although the move is very close to completion, but he did explain the decision to let Dawson leave.

'We decided it was good for him and good for us. I needed to take a decision as a manager. The past is the past. Football is all about the present. I worked for two months with Michael and I wish him all the best. We recognise what he did for this club.

'He is an unbelievable man and a very important player for Tottenham in the last 10 years.'

Lloris also paid his tribute to Dawson. 'Michael was an example for everyone, a top guy and a gentleman,' said the Spurs goalkeeper. 'He always tried to bring the team in the tight way and did great for the club.

'It's never easy to see a team-mate leaving the changing room but we know this is football life and everyone wishes him the best for the future. He is an open guy who did a good job as captain.'
