Busted: Reche Caldwell was arrested after police found him to be in possession of five pounds of MDMA

Former NFL wide receiver Reche Caldwell was arrested Tuesday with five pounds of the drug Molly, police said.

The 35-year-old former New England Patriot was pulled over just north of the Busch Gardens Amusement Park in Tampa, Florida, when police busted him with well over $170,000 worth of the party drug also known as MDMA.

Molly is made from the amphetamines often found in ecstasy that give users a feeling of extreme euphoria. It is often marketed by dealers as a 'pure' version of the drug often in the news for causing overdoses at raves and music festivals.

This arrest only adds to his legal troubles after an undercover sting exposed him earlier this year as one of three people running an illegal gambling ring in the city, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Caldwell was pulled over Tuesday afternoon and police quickly discovered the massive stash estimated by TMZ to be worth just under $180,000.

The former receiver derisively called ‘Ricochet’ by San Diego Chargers fans for routinely dropping passes during his four seasons with the team was charged with possession of a controlled substance and booked into Hillsborough County Jail.

His bail was set at $2,000, but the former million dollar earner has not been able to pay it, the Times reported.

Caldwell was also arrested along with a handful of accomplices in January and charged with illegal bookmaking and other related crimes. They notably also discovered about one gram of MDMA, in the gambling house, according to Bay News 9.

The troubled ex-player was also arrested in 2011 for driving with a suspended license and possession of marijuana, according to Bay News 9.

Caldwell bounced around the NFL afterbeing drafted in 2002 by the Chargers. Had stops with the Patriots, Redskins and then the Rams in 2008, a season in which he did not play due to chronic knee injuries that ended his career.

He caught 152 passes for 1,851 yards and 11 touchdowns during his time in the NFL.

Younger brother Andre Caldwell is a wide receiver for the Denver Broncos.
