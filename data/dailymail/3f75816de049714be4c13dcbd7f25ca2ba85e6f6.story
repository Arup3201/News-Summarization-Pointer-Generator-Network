The money is down but, to here, Manchester United’s roster has been largely unaffected by their post-Ferguson slump.

They still recruit big players, they still shed the ones of their choosing. David de Gea’s next career move could alter that.

He is out of contract in summer 2016, meaning United will want to get him signed long-term before the start of next season.

De Gea will be aware, however, that Real Madrid are in the market for a goalkeeper, with Iker Casillas nearing the end of his run. If De Gea stalls, it would be the first sign of United’s changing status.

For De Gea is not Cristiano Ronaldo. Playing for Real Madrid was never his dream. He was an Atletico Madrid boy, at the club from the age of 10 until his £18m transfer to United 11 years later. 

Often, such an upbringing makes a player immune to Real Madrid’s overtures. Fernando Torres said he would never play for them.

To lose De Gea just as he is reaching maturity would be a significant blow for United but it would equally demonstrate that they cannot remain untouched by this slump indefinitely.

With a long run until the next international break, Louis van Gaal’s regime must turn the corner. Champions League qualification is essential.
