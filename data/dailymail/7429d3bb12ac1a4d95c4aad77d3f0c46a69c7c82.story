A man has been arrested after he was caught on video pointing a handgun at another driver – and allegedly firing the weapon – in what police have called a case of ‘extreme road rage.’

Perrin Dobyns, 51, from Corydon, Indiana, was extradited to Kentucky on Tuesday, where he is expected to face charges of wanton endangerment.

The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon in Kentucky when a motorist recorded footage of Dobyns driving erratically in a black sedan across several lanes of traffic.

Perrin Dobyns, 51, from Corydon, Indiana, was arrested on Monday and extradited to Kentucky where he faces charges of wanton endangerment

When the motorist filming the erratic driver pulled up alongside, Dobyns lowered his passenger window and pointed a gun directly at the motorist behind the camera.

The motorist, David Kollar, claims he heard a shot being fired and that he slammed on his brakes to avoid being hit.

‘I was concerned for everyone's safety. I could get his plate and report it to police and let them follow up on it. I didn't expect to get shot at in the process,’ Kollar told WKYT. 

He stopped at the next available exit, about a mile and half away – and called the police who used the footage to determine that it was Dobyns.

He was arrested on Monday while working at the Branchville Correctional Facility in Branchville, Indiana as a doctor.

If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison.
