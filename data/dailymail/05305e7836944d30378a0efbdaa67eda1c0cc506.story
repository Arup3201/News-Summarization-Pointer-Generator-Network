A jobless Briton is on the run after he duped banks into giving him almost £300,000 in credit - and then blew the cash on a jet set lifestyle.

Tony Murphy, 40, was listed as unemployed yet managed to obtain credit cards, a mortgage and a secured loan by claiming he owned several successful businesses.

He bought two homes - including a suburban townhouse rented by a crime boss who lived next door to barristers, accountants and teachers. He also went travelling round the world visiting Egypt, America and Thailand.

Police investigating Murphy's finances 
raided his £350,000 home in Hale, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester, to 
find pictures of him posing with a tiger and an orangutan during a visit
to a zoo in Bangkok.

They also found a holiday photo of him parasailing in Sharm-el-Sheik and old passports detailing his journey across the globe.

Other pictures included a sepia photo of Murphy posing as a 1920s gangster in a pin striped suit and trilby hat with a young child holding a Tommy Gun. A giant poster of the 1980 mob movie Scarface starring Al Pacino hung on his bedroom wall.

Officers also found photos of Murphy with crime boss Jimmy Maxwell, 35, who is now serving 22 years in a Florida jail after being convicted of running an Ecstasy scam.

But while awaiting sentencing for his £295,000 fraud, Murphy did a runner and flew to either Alicante or Malaga and is thought to be hiding out in Spain's Costa Del Sol.

Greater Manchester Police today appealed for British ex-pats to call them if they recognise Murphy.

According to tax records, the fraudster had declared just £2,232 earnings over a six year period.

Yet on one credit card application he claimed he earned £70,000 through owning a car business, and on another that he earned £40,000 as an electrician for Manchester city council.

He bought Maxwell's townhouse in Hale, Greater Manchester for £225,000 following the gangsters arrest in the US in 2008.

Each room was fitted with giant plasma TV screens and erected stare of the art CCTV cameras to keep watch on activities outside.

Murphy also bought a house in Urmston near Manchester for £90,000 after getting a secured loan and handled £30,000 of cash which was gained through crime.

After the police raids he pleaded guilty at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester totwo counts of fraud, four counts of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and one charge of acquiring criminal property.

But he fled before sentencing and last week was jailed for two and a half years in his absence.

Det Sgt Pat Goodrich of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We had been investigating Murphy's financial background for a year before the raid.

'We found some very interesting evidence at his house - apart from the photos he had posters of the film Scarface on the wall of his property. We very much hope we can trace Murphy.'

Greater Manchester Police is in the process of applying for a European arrest warrant for Murphy.

Maxwell was the head of a Manchester based mob which successfully infiltrated the American Ecstasy market. He came up with a scam to sell the Class A drugs at a vastly inflated price.

But he was arrested by officers from the US drug enforcement agency in Florida after being tipped off police investigating the murder of an associate Andrew Boland, a 35-father of three who was shot dead at home in Stretford, Manchester in 2004.

Boland was a cannabis dealer and at the time of his death it was believed he had just returned from a trip to Las Vegas where he was involved in a drug deal - possibly with Maxwell.
