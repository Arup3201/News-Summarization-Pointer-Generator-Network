Never mind the typical attractions that will attract hordes of tourists this Easter, how about heading to West London to look at First World War Oxo cube wrappers or packages of Rolos?

Or travelling to Wales to visit a second-floor council flat that houses the world's only baked bean museum?

We may be a small island  but we do brilliantly bonkers attractions remarkably well. Here are some of the quirkiest attractions in the UK.

Robert Opie started Museum of Brands in 1984 and has collected over half a million wrappers and packages

Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising

Where: Notting Hill, London

As the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to discarded wrappers and packaging. The man behind it is Robert Opie, who has amassed a treasured collection of over half a million items, although only about 12,000 are displayed here.

His light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and had just finished some Rowntree’s Munchies and McVitie's and Price ginger nuts.

His thinking was that if he threw away the wrappers a small fragment of history would be consigned to rubbish.

The consumer historian has since become an authority on the history of supermarket brands and written twenty books on the subject. 

As well as biscuit tins and soap powder expect nostalgic toys, games and posters.

Captain Beany has curated a collection of bean tins,  money boxes, posters and other one-off memorabilia

Baked Bean Museum

Where: Port Talbot, Wales

Congratulations are in order for the 10-year anniversary of the world’s only museum dedicated to baked beans.

Captain Beany (previously Barry Kirk - he changed his name by deed poll) installed the exhibit dedicated to Heinz in his Port Talbot council flat back in 2005.

From a second-floor flat on the Aberavon seafront the bean enthusiast has curated a collection of bean tins, bean money boxes, posters and other one-off memorabilia.

The walls, ceiling and curtains are all orange and, when the opportunity arises, he dresses up in a cape, green pants, orange jumpsuit and painted face to become his alter ego, Captain Beany.

Visits are by appointment only and while there’s no fee, you may be asked to make a charitable donation.

Abbey Pumping Station has a loo with a see-through waste pipe so you can watch the progress of excrement

Abbey Pumping Station

Where: Leicester

In the 19th century this is where Leicester’s sewage was pumped to be treated.

Today its exhibits include the history of terminology for bodily waste written onto a toilet door and a loo with a see-through waste pipe so you can watch the progress of excrement ‘from flush to drain’.

The world's longest colour pencil measures 26ft and is located at the Cumberland Pencil Museum

Cumberland Pencil Museum

Where: Keswick, Cumbria

If you thought pencils were boring,  visit this museum in Cumbria.

You’ll find the world’s longest colour pencil (25ft and 11 inches) and a pencil used by RAF pilots with a hidden map and compass to navigate them out of war-time situations.

Other joys include the history of graphite and discovering how factories get colour inside  a pencil.

The World Worm Charming Championships have been held once a year in Cheshire since 1980

World Worm Charming Championships

Where: Cheshire

This only happens once a year but it is well worth the wait. Competitors gather in an attempt to charm as many worms from the ground as possible in a set time.

The sport was officially born on 5 July 1980 when a local Willaston farmer’s son, Tom Shufflebotham, charmed 511 worms out of the ground in half an hour.

The competition has been running ever since and a regulatory body  has been formed to enforce 18 rules and prevent cheating.

The event has a history of people cheating by hiding worms up their trousers and sprinkling them on  grass

There’s even such a thing as the International Federations of Charming Worms and Allied Pastimes.

Quite necessary, as it turns out, as the event has a history of people hiding worms up their trouser legs then sprinkling them onto the grass and even chopping worms in half to boost their final worm-count.

The date for this year’s event has yet to be released but it typically falls in June. 

The cement menagerie was sculpted by local builder John Fairnington to amuse his disabled son

Cement Menagerie

Where: Branxton

Just off the A697 between Cornhill-on-Tweed and Milfield there’s a spectacle not to be missed. 

The cement menagerie was sculpted in the 1960s and '70s by a local builder called John Fairnington to amuse his disabled son Edwin.

The 300-odd charming statues of animals and humans  include models of zebras, sheep, Lawrence of Arabia on his camel, and Winston Churchill.

Each was based on drawings and sculpted in galvanised wire netting stuffed with paper, then cemented over and painted.

The garden is free to visit but welcomes donations.
