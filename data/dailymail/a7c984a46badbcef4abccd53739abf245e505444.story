A woman and her two daughter were killed along with an elderly woman after torrential rain saw a main road flooded with up to nine feet of water in rush hour last night as huge storms his the U.S.

Kimberly Griffith, 45, and her daughters Brenna, 12, and Mikaela, eight, were trapped in their car which was completely submerged by water and pinned to a tree in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

A fourth person, a 70-year-old woman, disappeared and was found dead this morning after a search by about 40 rescue workers.

Across the Northeast there was weather chaos with severe thunderstorms and between two and three inches of rain in just one hour.

One man died in Milwaukee as a suspected tornado roared across northern Wisconsin cutting off power to around 2,000 homes.

In New York, the Subway service was disrupted as storm and flooding warnings were put in place.

Hundreds
of passengers were stranded for hours on airplanes that couldn't take 
off from John F Kennedy International Airport because of the severe 
storms.

The exact number of planes stuck on 
the 
tarmac was unclear, but irate passengers reported that it was the second
night that flights had been halted because of the weather.

In Pennsylvania, electricity to 
hospitals and universities was cut off and about a dozen cars were 
submerged with drivers forced to swim to safety or scramble on to the 
roofs of their cars as more than two inches of rain fell in an hour 
flooding Washington Boulevard, a main road that runs parallel to the Allegheny River.

Rescue crews used inflatable boats to 
reach marooned drivers, though some swam to safety on their own. 
Rhodearland 'Bob' Bailey of Penn Hills, 79, was rescued from the roof of
his car.

'I can swim a little bit and was 
looking at a tree branch,' Bailey told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'I
heard one woman yelling for help, but the water was coming down so 
fast, I couldn't see. ... I've never seen nothing like this in my life. 
Lord have mercy.'

The area 
received 2.1 inches of rain in an hour, according to Rihaan Gangat, a 
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. But an earlier storm 
meant the region was drenched by three to four inches of rain overall 
yesterday.

Ms Griffith and her daughters were unable to escape their vehicle, which was completely 
submerged and pinned to a tree, Pittsburgh public safety director 
Michael Huss said at a news conference.

Rescuers floated over the car without knowing it was below.

'The bottom of the boat didn't even scrape against the top of the car,' said Raymond DeMichiei, deputy director of the city Office of Emergency Management.

Harper said 18 vehicles were stranded
in the high water and 11 people were rescued. One of the rescued women 
required hospital treatment.

The
water had receded by the evening, but the mud-caked road will remain 
closed throughout today as emergency crews work to clear all the 
stranded cars.

Tara Howes, 34, of Gibsonia, told the Tribune-Review that 'manhole covers started popping up and it looked like the road exploded and the waters came up really fast. I saw people swimming on the sides of the road. It was pretty scary.'

The flash floods hit an area that experienced serious flooding last month. Washington Boulevard is situated in a valley. Rushing water from a July 18 storm stranded motorists and caused a section of the road to buckle.

Claudia Gallagher, 55, of West 
Mifflin, was driving north on Washington Boulevard at the height of the 
rainfall Friday and tried to get off the road as the water rose.

'We tried to drive up onto the curb, but the water had other ideas,' she told the Post-Gazette.

Her car began to float, and she opened
her window and climbed onto the roof. Many other drivers nearby were 
sitting atop their cars, too, she said.

Earlier yesterday, another storm caused power outages that led the University of Pittsburgh to close for the day. Parts of Carlow and Carnegie Mellon universities also lost electricity.

Flights at Pittsburgh International Airport were grounded because of lightning just after 3 pm, spokeswoman JoAnn Jenny said.

Two hospitals operated on emergency power after rains flooded a substation in the city's Oakland neighbourhood.
