A missing Nashville infant has been found in Alabama and her babysitter charged with kidnapping her.

Four-month-old Jalayia Gonzalez and her babysitter Javeele Thomas disappeared from the child's family home in Antioch last Thursday.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an alert over the child and the pair were found several hours later in Lineville - over 280 miles south of Nashville. The alert was cancelled on Sunday.

Police said that Thomas was pulled over in a car driven by a man. Gonzalez was found inside and was said to be safe and well-cared for.

The male driver was under the impression Thomas was the child's mother,  Wkrn.com reports. 

Lineville Police Department chief Monty Giddens said that Thomas had told her boyfriend in May or June last year that she was pregnant and that he was the father.

Giddens said Thomas lost the baby around October and stopped talking to the father in November, before re-establishing contact with him and informing him she had given birth.

The pair were subject to an endangered child, missing persons, alert by police; Gonzalez was found in the back of a car being driven by Thomas' boyfriend on Sunday

Thomas then 'made arrangements' to babysit Gonzalez and meet her boyfriend, Gidden said. And upon doing so presented the child 'to him as their child'.

The couple were on their way to Lineville to see the man's family when they were stopped. 

Thomas has been charged with second degree kidnapping, but has been released on a $20,000 bond.
