A month-old baby in North Carolina is dead after his parents left him in a hot car for two hours on July 27.

Sherrie Tiesha Clay and Shakee Duquan Robinson of Statesville were arrested on Monday and are charged with felony child abuse and involuntary manslaughter.

KTLA reports that the 4-week-old infant died of hyperthermia after Clay and Robinson returned home with their other children and their young baby.

Parents: Sherrie Tiesha Clay ans Shakee Duquan Robinson left a 4-week-old infant in an hot car for two hours

Clay and Robinson left their child in a hot, sweltering car for two hours until he was discovered by his aunt and rushed to the hospital where he later died.

Clay and Robinson are being held at Iredell County Jail on a $200,000 bond.

Their children are in temporary custody of child services.

Since 2013, at least 44 children have died from being in a hot car for too long either intentionally or by mistake.

More and more car deaths are being reported in the news but it's not a new phenomenon.

KTLA found data from a non-profit organization called KidsAndCars.org and reported that in the last ten years at least 388 children have died of vehicular heatstroke.
