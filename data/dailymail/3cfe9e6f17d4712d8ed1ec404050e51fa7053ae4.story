Apple has dramatically cut component orders for the iPhone 5 amid weaker than expected demand for the device.

The California-based tech giant has reportedly slashed the number of screens it wanted in half and reduced orders on other parts too.

Apple is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now until the end of March.

Shares of the company dropped 
dramatically on Monday on news of the sales drop. Apple stock dropped 
$18.55 a share, or 3.57 percent.

Falling: Apple stock hit its lowest level in 11 months on Monday over claims of and iPhone sales slump

Samsung's flagship Galaxy S3 has sold  40 million units worldwide - just two months after hitting 30 million.

The firm said is has now sold 100 million Galaxy S series devices.

Samsung said, 'The driving force behind Samsung Electronics' rise to the top on the global smartphone market is Galaxy S II which is gaining ground as a steady seller hitting the sales of over 40 million in only 20 months.'

The stock closed at $501.75 - the lowest level it has hit been since February 2012.

The sales claim is one of the most concrete signs so far that the iPhone 5 has not been the hit that Apple hoped.

It comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Google’s Android operating system.

Samsung’s share of the global smartphone market rose to 31.3% in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 8.8% in the same period in 2010.

Apple’s slice meanwhile fell from 14.6% down from a high of 23% at the start of last year.

According to the Wall St Journal, Apple may have made particularly large orders of iPhone 5 parts because it was concerned about the quality.

By over ordering they would ensure there were enough replacements to keep customers happy.

When the iPhone launched there were also concerns the three screen supplies - Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display - might not be able to keep up with demand, so Apple could have been stockpiling.

Last month Apple stocks were lowered by from Neutral to Buy by analysts at Citigroup.

In a report on December 16, it said: ‘It is unlikely that Apple is cutting orders in a 'great' demand environment’.

Other analysts have said Apple shares could plunge another 20 per cent amid fears it has run out of ideas.

Many feel that after the death of its founder Steve Jobs, it is just a matter of time before it runs out of steam.

Since Jobs’ death Apple has made some rare missteps that almost certainly would not have happened were he still alive.

Its chief executive Tim Cook admitted the company ‘screwed up’ with the its new maps service which was not as clear as Google Maps and missed out entire areas.

It also launched the iPad Mini even though Jobs specifically said before his death that Apple should never do so.

Another challenger to Apple is Chinese phone giant Huawei which sells cheaper smartphones and is now making inroads in countries such as the UK.

Apple’s stock price starkly illustrates the challenge it faces - it peaked at $705.07 in September but closed on Friday at $520.30.

Meanwhile, South Korea-based Samsung is expected to report that 2012 was its best year ever with profits up to $8.5bn for the last three months.

Apple will report its earnings for the same period later this month.

Leading smartphones are routinely chewing up more data than tablets, according to a report.

Devices like the iPhone, Samsung Galaxy SIII and HTC Sensation XL all take up more of your Internet allowance that larger gadgets.

The study blamed more advanced features like mobile chipsets and 4G/LTE support for the surge in demand.

Consumers were also behind the rise as those with smartphones also seem to have ‘increasingly voracious appetites’ when it comes to data.

The findings are surprising as tablets have more functionality than smartphones so would on the face of it seem to chew up more of your monthly plan.

They also use Wi-Fi meaning that you are not eating into your allowance when you surf the web.

Researchers found that smartphones tend to use significantly more data than a tablet

Analytics firm Arieso examined the data demands of more than one million users over a 24 hour period in November last year covering 125 different devices.

Overall, six of the ten most data hungry devices were smartphones - including the top three.

Using an iPhone 3 as the base level, or 100% of usage, the report found that the iPhone 5 had the most data volume at 414% by comparison.

The latest Samsung Galaxy SIII came in at 315% and the HTC Sensation had 317%.

The iPad 2 was just 259% by comparison.

The report said: ‘It is remarkable that users of the flagship smartphone devices from Apple, HTC and Samsung are seen to consume more data than the tablet users.

‘This is the first time that this dominance has been seen so consistently across manufacturers and reflects two trends: the inexorable increases of data consumption in smartphone devices and the relatively consistent use of tablets in WiFi (rather than cellular) coverage areas’.

Another surprising finding of the study was that the top one per cent of subscribers used up 40 per cent of data, although this was down on last year when it was half.

The report says: ‘Recent smartphone launches continue to reveal new breeds of data subscribers with increasingly voracious appetites, in part fuelled by the blurring of smartphone and tablet functionality.

‘The demands of prior smartphone subscribers are formidable and well known in the industry, especially with regards to iPhone 3G data volumes and numbers of data calls.

‘However, the introduction of new data-intense features on recent smartphones (such as the A6 chipset, larger Retina display and LTE support on the iPhone 5) raises the expectation that the users of these new smartphones will be even more intense data consumers’.
