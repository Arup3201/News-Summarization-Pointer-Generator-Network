A chic, vintage-style grey skirt suit; a sober, high-necked blouse; a beautifully soft pair of dove-grey suede courts: like the Queen, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall, Samantha Cameron donned an outfit for yesterday’s emotional ceremony that seemed both era and occasion-appropriate.

Until you spotted the flying saucer plonked atop her head at the strangest of angles, undoing the elegant understatement below her neck.

Not that the hat itself was at fault: a 
beautifully finished piece of millinery by society favourite Gina Foster
 (almost certainly bespoke, but very similar to her Amaryllis hat, 
£445), it is made of glossy sinamay expertly stretched on a concave 
block and finished with a matching bow.

For such an occasion, it was suitably 
reminiscent of the hats of the 1940s, something that Ingrid Bergman 
might have worn in Casablanca.

The
 problem, then, was in the wearing of it: her long fringe drooped 
messily over her face, and her hair was loosely pulled back in a 
chignon-cum-bun affair, covering her ears and jawline and undermining 
the dramatic lift of the brim.

With
 the hat sitting so far forward it dipped low over her eyes, she seemed 
to be peering out from beneath it like an Old English Sheepdog. 

There
 is an art to stylishly donning a hat, one that we seem to have lost. 
‘In the 1940s, women were used to wearing hats, and 
suitably-accommodating hairstyles, to finish an outfit, without looking 
like they were going off to a wedding every day,’ says Rachel 
Trevor-Morgan, milliner to the Queen.

Indeed,
 perhaps it is her own wartime vintage that makes Queen Elizabeth such a
 consummate hat-wearer. Her outing at yesterday’s D-Day events was no 
exception: her hat was immaculately matched to the fresh, pea-green 
colour of her coat.

Camilla,
 too, is fearless in her hat-wearing and yesterday’s broad-brimmed white
 number, with its apricot trim, was a perfect match for the custom-made 
Dior coat.

Elsewhere in Normandy, the Duchess of Cambridge proved that a
 retro-style hat could look utterly contemporary, with an upturned disc 
hat in black straw, with a looped straw ribbon-style decoration.
