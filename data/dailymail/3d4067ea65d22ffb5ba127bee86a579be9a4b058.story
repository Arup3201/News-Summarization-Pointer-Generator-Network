Harry Redknapp is one of the game’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Here, in the latest extract from his fascinating book, he reveals the clamour for Kenny Dalglish's signature and charts the beginning of English football's influx of foreign talent. 

Where are Gazza's friends when he needs them most? 

My team of the 1970s

My team of the 1980s 

I go back a long way with Kenny Dalglish. He came for a trial at West Ham in 1966 and I would drive him to training.

The 15-year-old Kenny was with us for two weeks — everyone in the country was trying to sign him.

I had a little green Austin 1100 and would collect him and another Scottish lad, Jimmy Lindsay, from digs.

Dalglish (seen scoring against Partick Thistle) was a wanted man and went on to sign for Celtic soon after

One Saturday morning we had a practice match and manager Ron Greenwood played him with the first-team players. One of the lads laid a ball to him and it was like fast-forwarding through the next 20 years of British football — he took it perfectly, dropped a shoulder, turned and curled it into the far corner of the net.

Our reserves didn’t know what had hit them. Both sets of players just stopped and applauded.

I can remember talking to Ron about him after that game.

‘Will we get him?’ I asked. ‘No chance,’ he said. ‘We’ve tried. Everybody wants him, but he’s going to Celtic.’

I don’t remember him being very talkative then, but I’m not sure I would have understood a word anyway. The strength of Kenny’s Glasgow accent is legendary. When Liverpool wanted to sign my son, Jamie, Kenny rang up to speak to us about it.

I could hear my wife, Sandra, on the phone but I didn’t know who she was talking to.

‘I’m sorry,’ she kept saying. ‘I can’t understand your Scouse accent.’ She must have said it about four times.

In the end, I heard her say the name Kenny. I took the phone, just in time to hear Kenny saying in the broadest Scottish tone you’ll ever hear, ‘Can ye nae understan’ me?’

Dalglish enjoyed eight  successful years at Celtic Park (pictured playing in an Old Firm derby against Rangers)

That’s my missus. She’s got to be about the only person who doesn’t know Kenny Dalglish is from Scotland. ‘I thought he was from Liverpool,’ she said. ‘No, he manages Liverpool — he was born in Glasgow,’ I replied. We got there in the end.

Kenny was just a fantastic player. Absolutely world-class. He could hold the ball as well as any man twice his size; he could bring team-mates into play or take it on himself. He didn’t have pace, but that didn’t matter. His pace was in his head. He was the attacking equivalent of Bobby Moore, in that he read the play better than anybody.

He scored 30 goals in his first season for Liverpool, including the winner in the 1978 European Cup final against Bruges. It allowed them to maintain this fantastic period of dominance in the English game.

Graeme Souness played a huge role in Liverpool’s domination, too. Souness’s transfer fee, £350,000, sounds like a snip — but it was a record for a move between two English clubs in 1978 when he signed from Middlesbrough. He had glorious talent. And, just like Billy Bremner and Dave Mackay, he was happy whatever way you wanted to play the game.

A pure football match, and he was the best player on the field. A tear-up, and he would be nastier than anybody.

Souness seemed to have a particular problem with Peter Nicholas, a Welsh midfielder who played for Arsenal. In one game, Nicholas went in high on Graeme, and soon afterwards Souness put him out of football for two months.

He was feared. Players thought he was evil and he liked intimidating people. That was part of his job. The only person I know he’s scared of is his wife, Karen.

By the end of the 1970s, Ossie Ardiles, Ricky Villa (both Spurs), Arnold Muhren and Frans Thijssen (both Ipswich) had come to our game. It was the beginning of the thought process that foreign players were needed for the skilful jobs because our own players weren’t up to it.

Much of the blame for that can be laid at the door of Charles Hughes. The former PE teacher became the assistant director of coaching at the Football Association and rose to a position of great power and influence in the game.

Under him, we missed an opportunity, thinking that we could teach the Brazilians about football rather than the other way around.

We told ourselves that Brazil were getting it wrong with all those passes!

Ricky Villa (seen playing for Spurs against Aston Villa in 1978) was one of English football's first foreign imports

Tottenham also signed the mercurial Argentine Ossie Ardiles (pictured in the 1980s) in their ranks

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV!

Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct  

Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too 

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that!

Even now, there are very few British coaches bold enough to try to play a very technical game. The long ball, the quick fix, will always be easier.

All of the coaching courses back then were run by men like Hughes. There was no flair — it was football as taught by PE instructors.

Some of them had even been to Brazil, but they returned with some madcap ideas.

Brazilian footballers hone their skills on the beach, we were told. It was where they learned to control a football and, we were informed, that was how we should do it, too.

Where the manager of, say, Derby County was going to find a beach when his training ground was about 70 miles inland, I don’t know. I will never forget there was a silence as we digested this brilliant insight. Some years later, I heard it repeated in the company of no-nonsense manager Jim Smith. ‘The beach?’ he said. ‘In that case, why aren’t Torquay, Southend and f*****g Brighton and Hove Albion top of the league?’

They had no answer to that.

Rodney Marsh (right, playing against Derby County) was a maverick while playing for Manchester City 

Marsh undermined City manager Tony Book by calling the rookie 'f****** useless' 

Alan Hudson (centre) only earned two England caps despite being one of the top players in the country 

The rest of Europe was moving towards total football, and we were going into an era when we stopped trusting our most skilful players.

Alan Hudson (two caps), Tony Currie (17 caps), Stan Bowles (five caps), Rodney Marsh (nine caps), Peter Osgood (four caps) — England had players that, technically, could have made any team in the world. We just didn’t pick them.

I cannot think of a bigger waste of talent in English football than Hudson’s two caps or Osgood’s four.

Players like Hudson and Marsh were brilliant, but mavericks. When full back Tony Book took over at Manchester City, Rodney was in open rebellion. It got back to Book that Rodney had described him as f*****g useless. ‘If you think I’m f*****g useless, this is never going to work. Do you want to take it back?’ Book said.

‘Actually,’ Rodney replied, unrepentant, ‘I don’t think you’re as good as that.’
