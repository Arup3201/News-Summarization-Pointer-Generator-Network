A British travel operator has been warned North Korea is on the brink of war after the government announced nuclear rockets are prepared to strike at the U.S..

Dylan Harris, director of Lupine Travel, which specialises in holidays to unusual places like Iran, Chernobyl and Siberia, received a worrying email from Pyongyang this morning.

The message from North Korean authorities said: 'The situation in Korea is now very serious as the U.S. have carried out a simulated nuclear attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea using B52 bombers and now B2A stealth bombers.

'The DPRK has now ordered its rockets to standby to destroy U.S. bases if the DPRK is attacked. The situation is now critical with the outbreak of war probably only hours away.'

Leader Kim Jong-un has put missile units on standby to attack U.S. bases marking a 'turning point' against American 'imperialism' and 'opening a new phase of history'.

Mr Harris, 34, from Wigan, has been a visitor to North Korea since 2007 and organises golfing trips to the country up to four times a month.

At the moment, there is a group of 10 - one Brit and nine Chinese - on the border who have just completed a five-day tour.

The Brit was due to leave the country tomorrow but left one day early after getting angry with how state-managed the visit was.

The university student, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline from the Chinese border city of Dandong: 'I felt safe and well cared for on the trip but that in itself felt annoying when you think about the poverty in the country.

'I was concerned when what was happening from the BBC News channel in our hotel in Pyongyang but I didn't feel any tension there despite that.

'We tried to find out what we could from the tour guides but they didn't seem too worried, they just kept saying that North and South Korean people didn't want a war and that if there was one it would be manufactured by outside forces.

'They seemed to say North Korea would
only go to war if it was provoked but when we asked what would provoke 
them they didn't say.

'It seemed very relaxed and peaceful 
there, but you can't really tell what is going on or what people think 
because of all the propaganda and everything you see is stage-managed.'

Speaking before the group left North 
Korea, Mr Harris said: 'I contacted the Foreign Office and if they say 
it's unsafe we will not travel or organise further trips to North Korea.

'However,
there is a group of ten golfers in Pyongyang, which is where the only 
public golf course is, who are due to fly out of the country tomorrow.

'One of them is British and nine are Chinese.

'I'm in constant touch with them and they are all safe and in good spirits.

'My customers know what they are getting into and they are travelling to hostile locations with the treat of war in the air.

Tensions: The drill involved the bomber striking a mock target, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap

'I think a lot of it is Kim Jong Un just showing the world his power and I'm optimistic that there will be no nuclear war with the U.S..'

'We had planned to organise a golfing tournament in May but with the current situation I don't know if that will go ahead, some customers have already cancelled.'

Mr Harris, who has been to the state, said: 'We've had warnings before but this is bit stronger than usual and seems a lot more serious this time

'It's never been much of a concern before but it has been in the back of my mind.'

In the early hours of this morning he received an email from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea warning him the outbreak of war could be 'hours away'.

State news agency KCNA said leader Kim Jong Un had signed off on the order at a late-night meeting of top generals.

KCNA quoted him as saying the time to 'settle accounts' with the U.S. had arrived and the the B-2 flights signalling an 'ultimatum'.

The DPRK has been unhappy about UN sanctions and felt antagonised over South Koream military drills.

The moves of the U.S. imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered a grave phase.

Not content with letting B-52 make sorties over south Korea in succession despite the repeated warnings, they made B-2A stealth strategic bomber and other strategic strike means fly from Whiteman air force base in Missouri State, the U.S. over south Korea on March 28 for the first time in history to commit such dangerous provocation as openly staging a drill for striking ground targets of the DPRK.

This fully proves that the brigandish ambition of the U.S. imperialists for aggression to stand in confrontation with the DPRK has reached an extreme phase defying the meaningful warning made by its revolutionary armed forces in the March 26 statement of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army.

In view of the prevailing grim situation, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, convened an urgent operation meeting on the KPA Strategic Rocket Force's performance of duty for firepower strike at the Supreme Command at 00:30 Friday.

Present there were Hyon Yong Chol, chief of the KPA General Staff, Ri Yong Gil, director of the Operation Bureau, Kim Yong Chol, director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau, and Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Rocket Force.

At the meeting he first received a report from General Kim Yong Chol, who is also vice chief of the General Staff of the KPA, on the information about the nature of action of the nuclear strike means of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces.

After receiving a report from Lieut. General Kim Rak Gyom on the technical conditions of the strategic strike means of the KPA, he made an important decision.

He said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation.

If they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces, the KPA should mercilessly strike the U.S. mainland, their stronghold, their military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in south Korea, he said. He examined and finally ratified the plan of the Strategic Rocket Force for firepower strike.

The U.S. imperialists let B-2A make sorties over south Korea in succession, indicating once again that their hostile acts against the DPRK have entered a reckless phase, going beyond the phase of threat and blackmail, he said.

B-2A's flight to the sky above south Korea is not a simple demonstration of forces in reaction to the tough stand of the DPRK but an ultimatum that they will ignite a nuclear war at any cost on the Korean Peninsula, he noted, underlining the need to put a definite end to the times when they could threaten and blackmail the DPRK with nukes.

He declared the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK would react to the U.S. nuclear blackmail with a merciless nuclear attack, and war of aggression with an all-out war of justice.

He finally signed the plan on technical preparations of strategic rockets of the KPA, ordering them to be standby for fire so that they may strike any time the U.S. mainland, its military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in south Korea.

He said the enemies are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war testing the DPRK's self-restraint, adding the DPRK can no longer tolerate this. He ordered the KPA to blow up and reduce everything to ashes at a single strike, if an order is issued.

He said the heroic service personnel of the KPA and all other people, their hearts burning with irrepressible resentment at the reckless war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists, are now waiting for a final order of the WPK Central Committee, hardening their will to turn out in a do-or-die battle with the enemies.

The KPA will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. imperialists' frantic moves for aggression but do its best to defend the destiny of the country and nation, he said.

It is the truth confirmed by history that no force on earth can hold in check the people all out for the just cause, he noted, stressing if an undesired war breaks out on this land again due to the consequences of the unpardonable action of the U.S. imperialists, it will bring them a shameful ruin and the Korean nation will greet the bright day of national reunification.

The important decision made by him under the grave situation where the Korean Peninsula has been pushed to the brink of a nuclear war by the U.S. imperialists will mark a turning point in putting an end to the history of the long-standing showdown with the U.S. and opening a new phase of history.
