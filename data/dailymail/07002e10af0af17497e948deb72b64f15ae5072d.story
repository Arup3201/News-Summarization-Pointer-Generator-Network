Tottenham set up a fifth round tie with Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup after goals from Ismail Azzaoui and Kyle Walker-Peters saw off Wolves on Thursday night.

The London side's comfortable win at Dagenham completes the last 16 line-up in the prestigious youth competition and keeps them in contention for a fourth triumph.

Belgian youth international Azzaoui fired Spurs into a 10th-minute lead when he seized onto Anthony Georgiou's through pass and swept the ball past goalkeeper Harry Burgoyne and into the far corner.

It was just reward for a bright Tottenham start which had seen an earlier effort by Azzaoui blocked at the back post by Tendai Matinyadze.

Their lead could have been doubled later in the first-half when 15-year-old centre-half Japhet Tanganga saw his shot from Georgiou's right-sided cross blocked.

Azzaoui also saw an effort pushed onto the post by Burgoyne in stoppage time as Spurs pushed for their second of the night.

Tottenham continued to be the better side after the break and the lively Azzaoui saw another shot blocked by the Wolves goalkeeper at his near post, with Cy Goddard seeing his rebound blocked.

But, just a couple of minutes later, Spurs did gain a contest-killing second goal when Goddard threaed the ball into Walker-Peters and he fired high inside the near post.

It would have been three had Burgoyne not been alert when Spurs substitute Ryan Loft was played in behind the Wolves defence.

Wolves rallied late on but couldn't claim a goal and Spurs progressed into the next round with a bit to spare.
