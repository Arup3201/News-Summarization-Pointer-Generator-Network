A nine month old baby, who had been fighting for his life for five days after he was hit by a forklift that his father was driving, tragically died on Thursday morning.

The young child died at the Royal Children’s Hospital with his devastated parents by his bedside.

The heartbreaking incident occurred at about 6.20pm on Saturday night at Blackley Automotive on the Bellarine Highway in Geelong - one hour south of Melbourne.

Police confirmed the baby was crawling on the floor of the factory at the time of the incident

The infant was rushed to Geelong Hospital before being airlifted to The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne in a critical condition.

It is understood the parents had been temporarily living in the garage with their four young children when the horrific accident happened, the Geelong Advertiser reported. 

Geelong Sergeant Pete Chamberlain said the father was behind the wheel of the forklift in a warehouse and had not seen his son who was crawling on the floor at the time of the incident.

'Anyone would be beside themselves, wouldn’t you?' Sergeant Chamberlain told the Herald Sun.

He added that it was still not known why the young boy was on the floor at the time as the family were by the baby's bedside in hospital.

Sergeant Chamberlain said police will work with the Victorian WorkCover Authority during the investigation which is being treated as an industrial incident.

Victoria Police spokeswoman Creina O’Grady told the Herald Sun that the child was not hit by the wheels or the forks, but possibly the front of the machine. 

The Royal Children's Hospital spokeswoman said Daily Mail Australia that the boy went into surgery on Saturday night for head and chest injuries and was expected to remain in a critical condition in intensive care for at least the rest of the day.
