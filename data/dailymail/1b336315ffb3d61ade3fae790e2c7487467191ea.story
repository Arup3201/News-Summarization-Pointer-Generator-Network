Three teenage boys have been charged with the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was shot in the head while the group were robbing summer homes - despite none of them firing the gun which killed her.

Scott Bryd, Dillon Tyree and Daniel Parnell, all 18, were indicted on felony murder charges on Wednesday by a grand jury after Summer Moody's death.

Miss Moody was fatally injured after homeowners fired warning shots on Gravine Island, Alabama when they saw the group robbing cabins around 4am on April 15.

Facing life: Scott Byrd, 18, who was Miss Moody's boyfriend and Dylan Tyree (right) are also charged with felony murder after being indicted

She died in hospital ten days later. Byrd, Tyree and Parnell are being held in the Baldwin County Corrections Center.

No charges were filed against the men who fired the shots  in the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta, a remote fishing camp.

William 'Nick' Hearn, Larry Dean 
Duncan and Lonnie W. Davison faced no charges because the shooting 
was deemed accidental by the district attorney.

The three men were working nearby on April 15 when they heard suspicious sounds coming from homes nearby. The three got in a boat and went to investigate.

They spotted Byrd and ordered him to 
stop. Hearn fired a shot in the ground and Duncan fired a second. It is 
believed that Duncan's shot Miss Moody where she was hiding in the 
bushes.

A grand jury is made up of citizens who decide whether a person should be charged with a crime - before the case proceeds to trial.

The evidence usually comes from a government-appointed attorney and probable cause must be determined.

At federal level, a grand jury has great power to access information and can subpoena whoever they like in order to prove criminal activity.

All proceedings of the grand jury are secret. This prevents those who may reap their consequences from going on the run and to stop witnesses who may later appear at trial being tampered with. It also protects innocent people from fully disclosing what they know. 

In Alabama, a felony case cannot be tried without an indictment from a grand jury.

They left but returned and put Miss Moody in their boat because it was faster to get her to shore for help.

Baldwin County District Attorney Hallie Dixon told al.com: 'Essentially but for the actions of these young men that night Summer Moody would still be with us and still be alive.'

Miss
Moody's family said that although the boys should be punished, they did
not pull the trigger.

They were upset that nothing had been done to the
men who fired the shots that killed the 17-year-old.

Byrd, who was Miss Moody's boyfriend, and his two friends were arrested following the night's tragic events.

A
grand jury came to the conclusion that a murder charge should be 
brought after reviewing all the evidence in the death investigation.

They are each being held on $250,000 bail over the felony murder charge.

Tyree had also been charged with assault and burglary charges.
