The Downton Abbey fashion trend came to life at Paris men's fashion week today as agnés b. sent an array of ghoulish models down the runway in her latest collection.

The upstairs/downstairs range featured ensembles that would not look out of place in Lord Gratham's wardrobe, notably a luxurious quilted smoking jacket in maroon velvet and Oxford grey.

Alongside expensive-looking three piece suits with silk cravats and shiny brogues, agnés presented cordouroy pantaloons, Victorian ankle boots and baker's hats - common attire for the working man in the post-Edwardian era.

Hair was anarchaic and dishevelled - models sported Shoreditch moustaches and Mr Selfridge beards alongside wet-look hairstyles.

Meanwhile, faces were dusted white with plum-shadowed panda eyes for a Living Dead look.

Gentlemen's gloves and pocket watches accessorised many outfits in cream and grey, while other models carried smoking pipes and wore sailor, baker boy or porkpie hats.

Most looks featured waistcoats and many 'upstairs' suits - suited hugely to Downton's cousin Matthew Crawley - featured turn-up trousers with stirrups strapping onto shiny patent brogues.

Skinny ties fastened around fine pinstripe shirts while silky champagne cravats covered others.

More modern looks also featured - but did not look too out of place. Monochrome sneakers, boiler suits and understated jean-look trousers slipped a contemporary vision in with the retrospective collection.

Hair is romantic and free, yet the man is sharp-suited. The look is reminiscent of writers like Oscar Wilde

French designer Agnès Troublé, aka agnés b., presented her Fall/Winter 14/15 range on the final day of men's fashion week in Paris today.

She has been designing menswear for more than 30 years and cites film noir and crime thrillers as her inspiration.

Agnes, 73, came out to greet her audience at the end of her presentation, fresh faced and with her hair curled. She shook hands with her models as she walked on.

Paris men's fashion week runs January 15 - 19.

The presentation ranged from Victorian to uber-modern - yet the feel was universal and ultimately chic
