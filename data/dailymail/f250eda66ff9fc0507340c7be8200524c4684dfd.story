In the wake of the Paris terror attacks and the arrest last week of an Ohio man who was planning an all-out assault on the U.S. Capitol , the FBI is now revealing how they foiled a planned 2012 terrorist plot on American soil.

Moroccan national Amine El-Khalifi, then 29, of Alexandria, Virginia, was arrested in a parking garage wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest in hopes of blowing up the U.S. Capitol.

He had gotten the vest from who he believed were al Qaeda operatives, but were in fact undercover FBI agents.

Moroccan national Amine El-Khalifi was arrested in a parking garage in 2012 wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest in hopes of blowing up the U.S. Capitol

The FBI had been following him for months, secretly filming him with undercover agents he thought were al Qaeda operatives

Now, the FBI has also released video to ABC News that was taken of El-Khalifi before he was apprehended, showing his excitement as he makes and tests bombs and plans his attack.

In fact, when he sees the bomb explode, his first reaction is to say that it needs to be bigger to do more damage.

'It’s a striking moment,' says Assistant Director In Charge Andrew McCabe of the FBI's Washington Bureau.

'The message that you have to take away from seeing a tape like this is the understanding that these folks are out there.'

McCabe's statements seem to be backed up by El-Khalifi's lack of remorse during his trial, with his only words to the judge being; 'I just want to say that I love Allah. That’s it.' 

El-Khalifi was apprehended after parking his car in the above garage and getting ready to walk into the Capitol

He had embarked on a largely self-taught rediscovery of his religion after a misdemeanor assault conviction in 2007, before which he had been active on the D.C. club scene, taking drugs and occasionally producing music according to prosecutors.

He was ultimately sentenced to 30 years in prison, the maximum allowed under the plea deal he struck.

He will be deported to Morocco after serving his sentence.
