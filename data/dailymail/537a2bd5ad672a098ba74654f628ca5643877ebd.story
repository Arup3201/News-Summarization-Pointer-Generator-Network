It's not the first place you might think of when booking a ski trip.

But in sunny South Africa's Drakensberg mountain range, fans of the downward slope can gather for an altogether surreal ski experience. Just don't expect soft powder and runs which go on for miles.

Tiffindell resort, which is perched upon the Ben McDhui peak  - the highest point in the Cape - offers tourists the chance to hit the slopes South Africa style.

Accommodating about 150 guests in timber chalets, the resort offers three- and four-night ski and snowboard packages. 

And for those all important apres ski refreshments -  it also boasts the highest pub in South Africa.

But the major flaw to the ski resort is that it sees very little actual snowfall. 

The mountains are high and dry, and while the area sees the occasional blizzard, it can go as long as a year without seeing a single flake of the white stuff.

Downhill: When it opened the resort boosted tourism, but it was later closed due to a lack of custom

Instead, the process of snow-making - usually used by ski resorts to supplement natural flakes and extend the season - is employed by resort staff.

The artificially-made white stuff covers around 1,000m of ski runs for three months of the year during an average winter.

But this type of snow creates a super-slidey surface, which while being popular with ski races, can be risky for beginners - or indeed anyone other than true professionals.

It's also quite an adventure to get there. Situated 24km above the town of Rhodes and about 212km east of Aliwal North, it is only reachable in small vehicles with no trailers  in dry conditions.

Originally established in 1993, making it the first resort in the area (there is another one Afriski in neighbouring Lesotho), initially it brought people to this remote area, boosting local tourism. 

But things went downhill and the resort was closed in 2010 due to a lack of custom.    

It was sold at auction in 2012 and reopened in 2013 by local skier and businessman Lew Campbell.

'I used to go to Tiffindell all the time, and I'm part of this special community of skiers in South Africa,' he said at the time.

While most ski resorts boast hundreds and sometimes thousands of acres, Tiffindell's five acres might seem a little poky. It also only has one ski lift.

On the plus a day ticket at Tiffindell is 385 South African rand, which is just over £20 - it's a steal.
