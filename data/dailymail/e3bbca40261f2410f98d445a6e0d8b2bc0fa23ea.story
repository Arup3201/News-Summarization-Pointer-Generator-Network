They may have been married for over fifteen years but Jamie and Louise Redknapp prove they're more in love than ever in these candid shots.

The power couple have just been unveiled as the stars of Pandora's Christmas campaign, where they star alongside lovebirds Rochelle and Marvin Humes, and best friends Jameela Jamil and Rick Edwards.

The jewellery giant called on the popular celebrity couples to star in the #PANDORAwishes campaign.

Power couple: Jamie and Louise Redknapp, who have been married for over fifteen years and have two children together, are the stars of Pandora's Christmas campaign

The new adverts aim to promote the brand's online wishlist, which allows shoppers to hint at what they want by sharing their ideal gift with others in the run up to Christmas.

Ex-Eternal singer Louise tied the knot with football pundit Jamie back in 1998 and the couple have two children, Charley and Beau together.

Clearly still very much in love, the pair pose intimately as Louise showcases the brand's jewellery offerings.

Former JLS singer Marvin and The Saturday's star Rochelle, who tied the knot in 2012 and recently welcome a baby daughter, Alaia Mai, also star in the campaign.

Getting up close and personal, the lovebrids exchange some tender moments - and some bracelets and rings from the brand. 

Jameela Jamil, who is already an ambassador for Pandora, poses in a more friendly fashion with her fellow T4 presenter, Rick.

In the run up to Christmas, each celebrity pair will talk about gifting in the run up to Christmas, what Christmas means to them, and how the online wishlist can be used to solve the male issue of not knowing what to buy partners, friends and family for the festive season. 

The celebrities will also describe their ultimate Christmas wishes, which will be offered as prizes for a competition hosted on Pandora.net throughout the duration of the campaign. 

The prizes range from holidays abroad to VIP tickets to a summer festival in 2015, with Louise and Jamie’s ultimate wish being a beach holiday in a secluded, beautiful setting to spend quality time together away from a fast-paced life. 

Marvin and Rochelle have picked a spa weekend to unwind, and Jameela and Rick’s ultimate wish would be to go to a music festival in the UK and not have to work for once.
