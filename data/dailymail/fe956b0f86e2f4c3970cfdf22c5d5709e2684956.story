Two young teachers married for just three months have died after a driver taking them to the airport after a wedding lost control of the vehicle, sending them crashing into a tree.

In a further tragic twist, the newlywed wife, Jamie Soukup Reid, 25, was pregnant with the couple's first child. Ultrasounds were recovered from her purse.

She died instantly when the driver of their hired town car, 45-year-old Rodney Koon, lost control of the vehicle in Asheville, North Carolina on Sunday.

Her husband, 26-year-old Will Reid, was still conscious when paramedics arrived and he urged them to help his pregnant wife first. He also died from his injuries.

Speaking to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Jamie's father Ron Soukup, a retired engineer for Microsoft Corp., shared his heartbreak at losing the young couple, who were both teachers in Philadelphia.

'We lost our two kids and 
our first grandchild,' he said. 'She had the ultrasound 
pictures in her purse.'

He added: 'We loved Will like he was our son. He was a wonderful guy.'

The couple married on May 26 at the 
College of Physicians surrounded by friends and family, and beautiful 
Facebook photographs show them beaming happily on their big day.

They visited Asheville at the weekend to attend a wedding of one of Mr Reid's college friends.

Together: They were in Asheville, North Carolina to attend the wedding of another friend at the weekend

Newlyweds: The couple were married just three months ago and were expecting their first child

Happy: Family described the couple, who were both teachers in Philadelphia, as 'the perfect match'

Best friends: The couple met during their postgraduate teaching studies at the University of Pennsylvania

They were in the back of a town car heading east on Interstate 26 on 
Sunday morning when Koon lost control at 11.11am. The vehicle hurtled down an 
embankment and struck a tree, police said.

Jamie was pronounced dead at the scene while her husband died of his injuries at Mission Hospital.

Rodney
Koon remains hospitalized after the crash and could face charges. An 
investigation is continuing and police have not said what caused Koon to
crash.

But in search 
warrant applications filed on Tuesday, police investigators said Koon's 
'actions directly contributed to the collision,' the Asheville 
Citizen-Times reported.

The
warrants allowed officers to search the vehicle and a digital recording
device in the car’s electrical system was seized. It could reveal speed
and other operational details before the crash.

Tragic: The couple, who married in May, were pregnant with their first child and were carrying ultrasounds at the time of the crash. Will urged paramedics to save Jamie first - but it was too late

Koon operates A Premier Transporation Service Inc. and regularly takes people to and from the airport, the Citizen Times added.

The couple had met while attending the urban education master's program at the University of Pennsylvania and moving in the same social circles, according to a website set up for their wedding.

Mr Reid, who grew up in Phillipsbury, New Jersey, was a math teacher at the People for People charter school.

He
had been named the Valedictorian for Phillipsburg High School Class of 
2005 before earning a BA degree from Dartmouth College and his Masters 
of Education Degree from UPenn.

His
wife, who grew up in Sammamish, Washington, taught literature to 
seventh graders at the Harrity Elementary charter school in West 
Philadelphia. She graduated Magna Cum Laude from Whitman College.

'She was fantastic with the written word,' her father said.

Will Reid’s father, James Reid, an orthopedic surgeon in Phillipsburg, said that the young couple were a perfect match for each other.

'He was very talkative and had a dry wit,' Reid said. 'He was very funny. She was just beautiful and nice and happy. She was very caring. They were very much caring for each other.'

A memorial service will be held for the couple on August 17 at noon in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.
