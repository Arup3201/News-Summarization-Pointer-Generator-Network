Google will reportedly be fined £14.5million for spying on millions of Apple customers.

The company is at the centre of yet another privacy row, having been accused of bypassing web security settings.

It allegedly tricked Apple’s Safari browser – found on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers – into dropping its automatic privacy safeguards, allowing it to snoop on users across the globe, including those in Britain.

The predicted fine would be the 
biggest ever levied on a single company by the US Federal Trade 
Commission. With Google reporting a net income of £1.8billion in the 
first quarter of this year, it would take the company just over 17 hours
 to earn enough to pay it off.

The firm, which generates billions 
from advertising, is still under investigation in the UK after it 
gathered personal data from homes’ unencrypted wireless networks while 
collecting information for its Street View maps.

It also signed a legal settlement 
with US regulators last year pledging not to ‘misrepresent’ its Internet
 monitoring activities.

Companies such as Google track 
browsing trends to demonstrate how well their adverts attract users’ 
attention. However, Safari, the most popular browser on mobile devices, 
is designed to prevent firms from being able to see people’s preferences
 and search choices.

Watched: Google said the tracking - on computers and iPhones - was 'inadvertent' and they have now removed 'cookies' that allowed data to be collected

It does this by barring the 
installation of small files, known as cookies – but according to the 
Wall Street Journal, which revealed the practice earlier this year, 
Google exploited a loophole that made an exception for adverts that 
invited interaction, such as those featuring forms to fill out.

The FTC launched the latest probe 
into Google in February after researcher Jonathan Mayer of Stanford 
University, California, discovered a hidden code that the firm 
reportedly used to circumvent Apple’s security settings.

When the Wall Street Journal carried out its investigation earlier this year, it found that the tracking system placed by Google's ad network was on scores of the most visited websites on the internet.

The tracking technology was found on websites on Apple computers and iPhones.

Websites included YouTube, aol.com, about.com, whitepages.com, nytimes.com, tmz.com, match.com and merriam-webster.com.

There is no indication that the sites knew of the tracking code.

A subsequent study by the WSJ spotted
 the code on some of the internet’s most popular sites, including 
YouTube, which is owned by Google, and that of the New York Times.

There is no indication that sites 
knew they were hosting the tracking code. Yesterday a spokesman for 
Google UK insisted the company had not infringed anyone’s privacy.

‘We cannot comment on any specifics,’ he said. ‘However, we do set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users.’

He said the FTC investigation centred
 on a statement made on a help page from 2009 ‘published more than two 
years before our consent decree, and a year before Apple changed its 
cookie-handling policy’.

The WSJ said Google scrapped the system when it was contacted by the newspaper earlier this year.

‘We have now changed that page and 
taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal 
information, from Apple’s browsers,’ Google’s spokesman added.

Britain’s privacy watchdog reopened 
its investigation into Google last month, after US regulators revealed 
that the firm’s Street View cars deliberately collected personal data.

Google initially told the Information
 Commissioner that downloading data such as phone numbers and passwords 
had been ‘a simple mistake’.
