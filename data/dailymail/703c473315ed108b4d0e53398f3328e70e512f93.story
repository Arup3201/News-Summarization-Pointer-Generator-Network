A former RAF serviceman has been found guilty of stabbing his wife to death during a drunken row over her shopping habits.

James Roy Simister, 49, dialled 999 to request help after repeatedly plunging a blade into his wife Deborah's neck during an argument at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire on April 8 last year.

Simister later claimed he couldn’t remember attacking the 45-year-old mother-of-one, with a breathalyser test showing him to have been four times over the drink-drive limit at the time.

Deborah, who had been married to James Roy Simister for five years, had previously told friends and family that she wanted to separate from her husband.

Winchester Crown Court heard she had packed her bags and was planning to leave Simister the next day to stay with her elderly father for a few weeks.

The couple, known as Roy and Debbie, 
had a volatile relationship with a history of domestic violence and 
alcohol abuse, the jury heard.

The pair had apparently spent the afternoon of Monday, April 8 
drinking after a shopping trip to Andover with one of Mrs Simister's 
daughters.

The court heard the pair got into an 
argument about how much they spent on other family members, before Simister lashed out with a knife.

Mrs Simister was stabbed several times in her neck and died later in hospital.

Following the attack, Simister called 999 and said: 'I’ve just stabbed my wife.'

Asked if she was all right, he responded: 'No, she’s dying. Please get here.'

Simister, who was four times over the drink drive limit when the stabbing occurred, admitted his relationship with his wife often led to violence.

Giving evidence, he said: 'It was always something of nothing...It wasn’t the best, we were trying to sort ourselves out to a future we could enjoy.'

A jury convicted him of murder today following a trial at Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire.

Simister will be sentenced at the same court on Monday.

The murder victim’s family released a tribute to her at the end of the tragic case.

It said: 'We are happy with the verdict and the fact that he was found to be guilty, but no amount of imprisonment will bring back our precious Debs.'

'She was the heart and soul of our family and now that she is no longer with us, we are completely torn apart.

'All generations have been affected, not to mention that she will never see her beautiful grandchildren grow up.

'Heaven has gained an angel and she will always live on in our hearts. Now it is all over we can finally put it all to rest and move forward.'

Detective Sergeant Pete Ritson, of the Wiltshire Police Major Crime Investigation Team, said: 'Tragically, Roy Simister’s actions that night deprived Debbie of that chance to leave and continue making positive changes in her life.

'The outcome today may not bring much comfort to Debbie’s friends and family but we hope that they feel justice has been done. Our thoughts are with them, and most importantly, her children at this very difficult time.'
