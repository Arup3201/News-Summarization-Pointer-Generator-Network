A Chinese fireman has been sacked after taking a new £500,000 fire engine for a spin after a night of heavy drinking and leaving a trail of destruction in his path.

Chen Huangxin got behind the state-of-the-art vehicle, wearing just his slippers and pyjamas after an evening of drinking alcohol in Yunlin County in south-eastern China.

But he caused extensive damage when he crashed the truck and upon being pulled from the wreckage by the emergency services, he was found to be three times over the drink-drive limit.

The 32-year-old said: 'I am sorry. I just wanted to see green fields and trees.'

During his drunken drive, he managed to smash into a lorry, knock down a pole carrying overhead electrical wires, hit several parked cars and then overturn the vehicle, injuring himself in the process.

The Finnish-made fire engine is now out of service until parts can be shipped from Europe.

A spokesman for the fire service where Mr Chen was employed said: 'It is hard to think of anything worse he could have done.

Mr Chen, who injured himself in the crash, has now been dismissed from his job and is facing a number of criminal charges

'This engine was our pride and joy, the best in our fleet. And he managed to almost destroy it. He will never work again for us.'

Not only has he been sacked, Mr Chen is now facing a range of charges that could see him jailed for up to two years.

He told local media: 'I don't know what got into me. Normally I would never want to go driving when I have had so much to drink.

'But the urge was upon me and I couldn't stop myself.

'I realised I have brought disgrace upon me and the service I loved. I am truly sorry.'
