Senior Liberal Democrats are plotting a second coalition with the Conservatives even if Labour wins more Commons seats in next year’s general election.

Several senior figures insist the party should negotiate a second power-sharing deal with the Tories, predicting they are likely to win more votes even if Labour gains more Westminster constituencies.

They argue voters would take a dim view of the Lib Dems if they jump straight from five years of coalition with the Conservatives into a deal with Ed Miliband’s party.

Liberal Democrats are plotting a second coalition with the Conservatives even if Labour wins more Commons seats because they believe immediately switching to Ed Miliband's party would be condemned as 'utterly cynical' by many voters

One Lib 
Dem minister said that the move would be seen as ‘utterly cynical’ by 
many voters and mean probable ‘annihilation’ for the party in the 2020 
general election.

With most polls pointing to another hung Parliament, the minister suggested the Lib Dems could enter coalition again with the Tories even if they gained fewer seats than Labour.

Another senior MP said there was a strong possibility that the Tories could gain more votes than Labour, but fewer seats, while Ukip could gain more votes than the Lib Dems, but no seats.

While a Lib-Lab coalition would be 
possible in those circumstances, it would lack ‘democratic legitimacy’ 
in the eyes of many people, the MP said.

Nick Clegg has said the Lib Dems will take their cue from the electorate in the event of another hung Parliament

Nick Clegg has said the Lib Dems will take their cue from the electorate in the event of another hung Parliament, but has been careful to leave his options open by not specifying whether that means he will talk first to the party which gains more seats or more votes.

Electoral forecasters say there is a good chance that the Conservatives will pile up more votes than Labour, but end up with fewer seats, in the general election due to take place in nine months’ time.

In 2010, David Cameron’s party got 10.7 million votes but won 307 seats, leaving them short of a Commons majority.

Under Tony Blair in 2005, Labour only gained 9.5 million votes but won 413 seats, giving the party a comfortable majority. This is because the average Labour seat is much smaller than the typical Conservative one.

The coalition agreed to redrawn the boundaries of Commons constituencies to make general elections fairer, while saving taxpayers large sums by cutting the number of MPs by 50.

But when Tory backbenchers conspired with Labour to block plans to introduce a limited degree of democracy to the House of Lords, a key Lib Dem proposal, Mr Clegg responded by killing off the boundary changes.

That means the Conservatives will fight next year’s election with a significant inbuilt disadvantage, with pollsters estimating that they need to be at least six points ahead of Labour to hope for a small majority.

In 2010, David Cameron's party got 10.7 million votes but won 307 seats, leaving them short of a Commons majority, whereas under Tony Blair the party won 413 seats

Although the Lib Dems are flatlining in terms of national opinion polls, most pollsters believe they have every chance of hanging onto enough seats to hold the balance of power once more.

The private pressure for another Lib-Con coalition next year flies in the face of the public arguments of many senior Lib Dems.

Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who is on the right of his party, said he believes Labour will be the largest party after 2015 and that the Lib Dems were likely to enter power-sharing talks with them.

Labour and the Lib Dems have also quietly aligned policy pledges in more than a dozen areas, apparently in readiness for a potential power-sharing deal after next year’s general election.

These include cutting pensioner benefits, scrapping Tory tax breaks for marriage, new green taxes, reducing the voting age to 16 and a new mansion tax on expensive homes.
