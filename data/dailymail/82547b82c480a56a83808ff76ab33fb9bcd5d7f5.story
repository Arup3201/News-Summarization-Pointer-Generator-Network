Christmas can be a time for indulgence - but sometimes it’s better to look rather than touch.

Leah Foster, of Dilley, Texas, has created astonishing installations in her home state and New York City by baking tens of thousands of different-coloured cupcakes and stringing them together.

The 24-year-old - an art student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York - has baked more than 13,000 cupcakes for just two of her projects, but has lost count of the total number she has put in the oven.

Difficult choice: Leah Foster, 24, of Dilley, Texas, has created astonishing installations in her home state and New York City. Pictured is her Muffin Tops installation at ConArtist NYC in Manhattan, New York

Impressive: The 24-year-old - an art student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York - has baked more than 13,000 cupcakes for just two of her projects, but has lost count of the total number

Fade out: She has learned how to bake on an industrial scale - making 10,000 cupcakes specifically for a show at ConArtist NYC in Manhattan, New York, and 3,000 for a project at GuerillaArts in Dallas, Texas

Miss Foster told MailOnline: ‘I 
started baking the cupcakes as a way to explore gender-based body image 
expectations. It started out because cupcakes were a guilty pleasure for
me.

‘I'd bake them all the time, but never
eat them. I really began to question the idea of the guilty pleasure. 
Was it for health reasons or for vanity?

‘Was it because I've been taught that there is a certain image that I need to fit in order to be a presentable woman?

‘I also began to identify with what I
call the duality of the cupcake - this attraction and repulsion that 
exist at the same time.'

She has learned how to bake on an 
industrial scale - making 10,000 cupcakes specifically for a show at 
ConArtist NYC in Manhattan, New York, and 3,000 for a project at 
GuerillaArts in Dallas, Texas.

Tempting: Miss Foster told MailOnline that she 'started baking the cupcakes as a way to explore gender-based body image expectations'

Surrounded by cakes: One project was aimed at girls with personal insecurities - helping them bake cupcakes and write down a fear, insecurity, or anxiety which would then be stuck into their cake, like a fortune cookie

Put to good use: The cupcakes are impressive to look at when all stacked together, with different coloured paper cases and icing to create a beautiful effect

The student insisted she uses nothing 
to preserve the cupcakes, although has to ensure they are solid enough 
when stacked in towers to avoid them falling apart.

One of her projects was aimed at girls with 
personal insecurities - helping them bake cupcakes and write down a 
fear, insecurity, or anxiety which would then be stuck into their cake, 
like a fortune cookie.

Miss Foster told MailOnline: ‘I asked
all of them to decorate the outside of their cupcake with the way they 
present themselves to the world - such as bright, colourful, shy, quiet 
or classic.’

She added: ‘A cupcake is almost 
everything I've been taught to be. It is cute, pretty, and petite, yet 
individual - not part of the larger cake. I feel this is symbolic of the
current situation of my generation.

‘Women are taught to be pretty on the 
outside and the inside, to be smart and attractive, to be individual and
independent. For me, the cupcake represents this contradiction and 
duality.’

Yum: Miss Foster, 24, has had a number of art installations around New York City and back home in Texas

Being herself: Miss Foster said that a cupcake is 'almost everything I've been taught to be. It is cute, pretty, and petite, yet individual - not part of the larger cake. I feel this is symbolic of the current situation of my generation'
