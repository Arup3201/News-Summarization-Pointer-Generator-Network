Tragic: Freya James, 8, was taken ill after the incident at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, Middlesex, last Thursday and died in hospital

An eight-year-old schoolgirl died after rupturing her liver when she bumped into another pupil during afternoon break, an inquest heard today.

Freya James told teachers at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, Middlesex, she felt unwell after the apparently innocuous playground collision on February 14.

She was taken to a classroom and given first aid by staff, West London Coroner's Court was told.

But paramedics were called and Freya was desperately rushed to West Middlesex hospital after she became 'incredibly unwell'.

She died just over two hours later in the A&E department.

Police and the health and safety executive are investigating the case but Freya's death is being treated as non-suspicious.

A post-mortem carried out on Wednesday gave the cause of death as 'abdominal bleeding caused by liver ruption'.

Coroner’s Officer Lana Atkinson told the hearing: 'Freya was a pupil at Trafalgar Junior School. On February 14 she was in the school playground, playing with other pupils.

'At approximately 1.15pm while playing she collided with another pupil and fell to the floor. This happened in the vicinity of railway sleepers. They were there for decorative and ornamental purposes.

'She then after this felt unwell and complained to staff. Staff asked whether she had hit her head. She replied ‘no’.

'She was taken into a nearby classroom and was given first aid, but she became incredibly unwell.

'An ambulance was called. Sadly she passed away at the hospital in the Accident and Emergency department at 3.54pm.

'A post mortem carried out at St Thomas’s Hospital gave the cause of death as hematoperitoneum 1b liver ruption.'

Her devastated parents, from Twickenham, released an 
emotional statement saying Freya was 'loved by everybody who had contact
with her' and that their 'hearts, bodies and souls are aching 
constantly' following her death.

They said: 'Freya was an Angel and was loved by everybody who had contact with her.

'She was a bundle of energy from the 
time she woke up to the time she went to bed. She was so strong and 
determined in everything she did and always tried to help those that 
struggled.

'Our princess has gone, but we know 
her spirit and her memories will always be with us. Our lives have been 
absolutely shattered. Our hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly
and we are left with scars that will never heal.'

The school is linked with five others
in the area, and a Governor at a neighbouring school said health and 
safety procedures were being looked into at all those linked to Trafalgar 
following the death.

Ms Atkinson said: 'The police and health and safety executive are involved. It is being treated as a non-suspicious incident.'

A full inquest will take place at a later date.
