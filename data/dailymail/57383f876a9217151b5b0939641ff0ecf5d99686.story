Taking time out: George Michael will not be performing in Australia

George Michael has cancelled his Australian tour after announcing he was suffering from ‘major anxiety’ as he continues to recover from a near-fatal bout of pneumonia.

The singer said he had underestimated how difficult his recovery would be after his brush with death a year ago.

The former Wham star said he will undergo further treatment to help him cope with the mental issues caused by the after effects of his illness.

The 49-year-old spent a month in a 
hospital in Vienna, Austria, last November where he said it was 'touch 
and go' if he survived.

Since
recovering he has continued to sing and appeared at the Olympic Games 
closing ceremony where he performed 'White Light', a song inspired by 
his near fatal illness.

In a
statement issued by entertainment promoter Dainty Group yesterday, 
Michael said the cancellation of his nine-date Australian tour next 
month ‘breaks my heart’.

He said: ‘I have tried in vain to work my way through the trauma that the doctors who saved my life warned me I would experience.

‘They recommended complete rest and the type of post-traumatic counseling which is available in cases like mine but I’m afraid I believed (wrongly) that making music and getting out there to perform for the audiences that bring me such joy would be therapy enough in itself.’

The singer said he had ‘seriously underestimated’ how difficult the past year would be.

‘Although I was right to believe that the shows would bring me great happiness and that my voice would recover completely (I truly think that some of my recent performances have been my best ever) I was wrong to think I could work my way through the major anxiety that has plagued me since I left Austria last December,’ he said.

The cancelled concerts were due to take place in Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Hunter Valley.

He
said he would complete the remainder of his shows in the UK this month 
before seeking further treatment for post traumatic stress.

Michael
had fallen ill last November after completing 46 shows of a European 
tour. His condition was initially described as a chest infection.

But as rumours swirled about the nature of his illness, doctors took the unusual step of releasing a statement revealing he was suffering from pneumonia.

Michael described his stay in the General Hospital in Vienna as the worst month of his life.

In an emotional press conference after returning to London he paid tribute to the medical staff who saved his life.

He said he suffered from a five week gap in his memory caused by the illness.

Last month he returned to Vienna to perform having given 1,000 free tickets to the staff of the hospital as a thank you gift.

‘This is one of the greatest honours of my life, to sing to the men and women who saved my life,’ he said.

After telling the crowd it was ‘great to be alive’, he performed a rendition of Nina Simone’s Feeling Good at the request of one of the doctors.

He also performed his new single White Light, telling the crowd: 'I think given the manner of men and women who did save my life, we could not go without singing this song.'

The hospital auctioned off many of the tickets to raise money for lung disease research.
