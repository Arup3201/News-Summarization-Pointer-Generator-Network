A couple have been sentenced to six months in jail for having sex outdoors at a Florida retirement community.

Charm Gilbert, 40, and James Adams, 47, were found guilty last week of indecent exposure and disorderly conduct in connection.   

Adams was spotted by a passerby who saw him naked in front of an also naked Gilbert, who was lying on an electrical box on a street in The Villages – a 50,0000-strong community for the over 55’s in Florida’s Sunter County.

The pair were told to cover up deputies when they arrived at the scene at round 8:42 a.m. Wednesday to the intersection of Morse Boulevard and El Camino. 

Adams told the deputy he was having sexual intercourse with Gilbert, 40, at the time due to them not having any other place to go, according to the arrest, reports The Smoking Gun.

Adams and Gilbert were taken to Sumter County Jail, reports Click Orlando. 

The pair have been in custody since their arrest and pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor counts. 

In addition to the jail time, they have each been ordered to pay more than $1000 in fines and court fees.

The Villages bills itself as 'Florida's Friendliest Retirement Hometown' and has three town squares offer shopping, dining, and theater along with free nightly entertainment that finishes at 9 p.m.

It is not the first time The Village has hit the headlines for this - in June a 68-year-old woman who was arrested for having sex in public there was sentenced to six months in prison.

Margaret 'Peggy' Klemm had sex with 49-year-old David Bobilya at the pavilion at Lake Sumter Landing Market Square at around 10:30pm on June 2.

The pair were arrested for public indecency just days after Klemm was given probation in court for drunk driving in a golf court in the retirement village. 

The Smoking Gun reports that when investigators arrived at the scene, a popular spot for nightly entertainment, Klemm had her shirt pulled down and wasn't wearing any pants.

Bobilya's pants and underwear were pulled down all the way to his ankles.

Police say that Klemm and Bobilya both seemed to be intoxicated but that they followed police officers' orders and put their clothing back on.

Klemm pleaded guilty in a plea deal. 

Her attorney said her sentence could have been up to one year in jail.

As she was sentenced, a tearful Klemm mouthed 'I love you' to her husband of 50 years Frank Klemm.

'She is a super woman as far as I'm concerned,' Frank Klemm told Click Orlando following the hearing.

'And she deserves a second chance. That's all I have to say.'
