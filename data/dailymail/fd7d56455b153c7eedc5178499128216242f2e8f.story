It was the writing refuge that inspired Evelyn Waugh to write the opening 1,300 words of Brideshead Revisited by the first night.

And now historic hotel, Easton Court, in Chagford, Devon, is going on the market for £1.65million.

The renowned writer had broken his leg while parachute training in the Second World War and was given unpaid leave.

Author Evelyn Waugh checked into Easton Court, Devon, in January 1944 to start work on Brideshead Revisited, his most famous novel

So he checked into the peaceful hotel  on 31 January 1944 to start work on what would be his most famous novel.

Mr Waugh wrote about the hotel being 'full of elderly women' who did not distract him from his work and explained how he would go on 'long and lonely walks'.

He would also attend church in the village of Gidleigh and was at the hotel when he received the news of the birth of his fifth child.

The writer said the hotel was 'something more than comfort' and added it had 'a tranquillity that makes it uniquely agreeable for both work and rest'.

Evelyn Waugh completed Black Mischief in 1932, A Handful of Ashes in 1934 and started work on Brideshead Revisited at the peaceful hotel in Devon

Waugh was educated at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and  worked briefly as a schoolmaster before becoming a full-time writer

Easton Court was a hotel for around 80 years and was owned from the 1920s to earlier 1960s by American Carolyn Cobb and her partner Norman Webb

The author said he was able to concentrate because the hotel was 'full of elderly women' who did not distract him from his work

He said the eight-bedroom hotel was 'something more than comfort' and added it had 'a tranquillity that makes it uniquely agreeable for both work and rest'

He explained how while at Easton Court he 'wrote with a zest that was quite strange' to him.

The hotel was also visited by Patrick Leigh Fermor, who wrote The Traveller's Tree there, as well as CP Snow, John Steinbeck and poet John Betjeman.

Emma Tallack, from estate agents Jackson-Stops, said: 'There has been plenty of people interested in the property because of its literary past.

'They really like the connections and the way it has been kept, it still has the charm that attracted writers here.

'The property is still so old-worldly, you can really imagine those writers coming here and writing.'

The couple were well known in literary circles and were particularly fond of Waugh, who had been introduced by his older brother Alec, a regular visitor.

He wrote that Mrs Cobb 'mixes menthol with her cigarettes' and described how they would 'drink rye whisky in her bedroom'.

The property is situated about 1.5 miles to the east of Chagford, in a small market town near Castle Drogo.

The main house has three bedrooms, a bed and breakfast wing with a five en-suite bedrooms and is set within 3.2 acres of land.

A cottage also has three bedrooms as well and its own garden, conservatory and dining room.

Both lots are available for £1.65million, while the main house only is also offered for £1.175million.

Brideshead Revisited was published in 1944 and was based loosely on his own experiences as a student at the University of Oxford.

It follows the story of Charles Ryder who becomes captivated by an eccentric young man and his very wealthy Catholic family.

It was also adapted into a film in 2008, starring Emma Thompson and Matthew Goode. The screenplay was based on the 1945 novel by Waugh
