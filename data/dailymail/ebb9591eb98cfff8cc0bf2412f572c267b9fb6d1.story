A crime author and former LAPD homicide detective claims to have new evidence that proves his own father was behind one of Hollywood's most infamous murder cases, the Black Dahlia murder of 1947.

Steve Hodel details evidence in his new book, Black Dahlia Avenger II, that he says implicates his father, a prominent LA surgeon of the time, in the gruesome unsolved slaying.

According to the author, his father Dr George Hodel was a suspect in the case when he skipped town, never to return.

Horrific murder: Short's body was found mutilated, severed at the waist and with ligature marks on her neck, wrists and ankles, near a busy LA intersection

Steve Hodel claimed earlier this year that his father killed 
Elizabeth Short at the family's Hollywood home, the distinctive Sowden 
House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, which is 
largely unchanged since the murder.

He established that he and his siblings had been away with their mother at the time of the murder.

Last
 November Hodel, together with retired police Sergeant Paul Dostie of 
Mammoth Lakes and Buster, a Labrador retriever trained to detect the 
unique smell of human composition, visited the property.

Once let loose, Buster quickly established four locations in the basement where he could pick up a faint trace of human remains.

On January 15, 1947, 22-year-old 
aspiring actress Elizabeth Short's severely mutilated body was 
discovered in a vacant lot near the intersection of 39th Street and 
Norton Avenue in Leimert Park, South Los Angeles.

Sensationalized: Crime author Steve Hodel, claims to have proof his father was the murderer in the Black Dahlia case that has fascinated the public for decades

Her
 body had been cut clean in half at the waist and completely drained of 
blood. Her internal organs had been removed. Her face had been slashed 
from the corners of her mouth to her ears and she had ligature marks on 
her wrists, neck and ankles. 

Short
 also had multiple cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions 
of flesh had been removed. The body had been washed and cleaned and 
‘posed’ with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, 
and her legs spread.

A woman out walking with her daughter discovered the body, which she initially took for a discarded shop mannequin.The
 horrific murder generated huge media interest, and it's been said that 
the media, which coined the colorful name Black Dahlia, was partly 
responsible for the inability of police to solve the case. Reporters 
trampled over evidence and withheld tips in order to score a 'scoop'.

To add to the case’s sensational 
intrigue, both LAPD officials and newspaper editors received taunting 
notes and personal possessions of Short's, believed to be from Short's 
killer.

Interest in the case hasn't waned over the decades. Numerous film and television productions have been based on the case, and the 2006 film directed by Brian De Palma and starring Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johanssen renewed the public's fascination with the mystery of the Black Dahlia.

In Steve Hodel's new book, he claims 
his six-year investigation into the case has unearthed brand new 
findings that implicate his father in the sadistic killing, including 
discounting several urban myths surrounding the case, physical evidence 
the murder took place at Sowden House and connecting the murderer to the
 vacant lot where the body was dumped, and evidence only a surgeon could
 have bisected the victim's body.

'This is new information that I've discovered, and the LAPD is unaware of this evidence,' Steve Hodel told KLTV.

Among
 the many claims in the book, Hodel says his father idolized his friend,
 the painter Man Ray. A distinctive cross-hatching appeared in many of 
Man Ray which Hodel says also appeared on the corpse of Elizabeth Short.

'Her body was his canvas and his scalpel was his paintbrush,' said Hodel.

The
 book also contains full transcripts from bugging devices the police 
planted in Dr Hodel's home and office, in which he makes multiple highly
 incriminating statements.

'Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now. 
They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead... They 
thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it 
out. Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary...' George Hodel is recorded saying in 1950.

Steve Hodel first made the claim that his father was the Black Dahlia murderer in his 2003 book Black Dahlia Avenger.

Dr Hodel, who was also investigated in connection with his secretary's death-by-overdose and faced 
sexual abuse claims from his 15-year-old daughter, was only one of 25 
viable suspects the LAPD was investigating.

More than 60 people have confessed to the crime at various times.

Hodel remains, along with  Walter Bayley, Norman Chandler, Leslie Dillon, Joseph A Dumais, Mark 
Hansen, George Hill Hodel, George Knowlton, Robert M 'Red' Manley, 
Patrick S O'Reilly, and Jack Anderson Wilson (aka Arnold Smith) a suspect in the case.

Before authorities could bring any charges against the surgeon, Dr Hodel abruptly abandoned his family and relocated to Asia. He died in 1991.

The LAPD has yet to respond to Hodel's claims to have solved the murder, but Commander Andy Smith told KLTV, 'We periodically receive pieces of information that come in on old cases. This is an active case. We take everything seriously until it can be fully investigated.'
