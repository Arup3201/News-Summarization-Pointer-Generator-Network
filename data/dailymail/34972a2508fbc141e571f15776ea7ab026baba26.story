When is a taxi not a taxi? When it’s booked through a smartphone.

While London’s black cab drivers have to gain licences and learn ‘the Knowledge’, private drivers booked through a new taxi app called Uber do not.

Now angry black cab drivers are threatening to bring the capital to a grinding halt on June 11 with a protest against the new threat.

Legal loophole: In London, it is illegal for private vehicles to operate with taxi meters, but California-based Uber, which operates in 110 cities, gets round this law by turning customers' mobile phones into the meters

In London, it is illegal for private vehicles to operate with taxi meters, but California-based Uber, which operates in 110 cities, gets round this law because the machines that monitor distance travelled and journey time are smartphones and are not physically attached to the vehicles.

Uber has attracted demonstrations and litigation in nine other cities.

Nevertheless, customers love it because, with a couple of swipes of a finger, the app gets rid of waiting in the cold and waving down cabs.

Uber allows clients to use their phone to book a private driver (who will have taken out commercial insurance and undergone a criminal records check).

They can also track the car using the app’s live map.

Threat: Uber's app is marketed as a way for drivers to start their own taxi business

Customers can see the  driver’s name and photo before they arrive and receive an email of their route to ensure they have not gone around the houses.

Uber takes a cut, usually 11 to 20 per cent, of the fares, which are taken from customers’ credit cards at the end of the journey — when they can also rate their trip.

Journey costs increase during busy periods, but customers are not encouraged to tip because the gratuity is factored into the metered fare.
