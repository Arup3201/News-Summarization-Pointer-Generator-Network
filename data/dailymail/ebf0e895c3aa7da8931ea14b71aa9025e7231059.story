Brazilian right back Danilo netted a crucial penalty for Porto as the visitors fought back against Basle in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash, though the fixture was dominated by two decisions from referee Mark Clattenburg.

Paraguayan midfielder Derlis Gonzalez opened the scoring at St Jakob-Park as Liverpool's conquerors looked set to take a narrow lead to Portugal, before Casemiro thought he had equalised for the visitors.

However, English official Clattenburg took two minutes to disallow the goal, and then awarded Porto a penalty after Walter Samuel was adjudged to have handled in the box. Danilo made no mistake, sending goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik the wrong way

Basle set themselves up as a team who first and foremost didn't want to concede, but scored with the first chance of the game in the 11th minute.

Fabian Frei chipped a perfectly weighted ball over the Porto defence and found Gonzalez, who held off his marker and prodded the ball past the Porto goalkeeper.

 But the Paraguayan was involved in a heavy collision with Fabiano in his efforts, with the Porto stopper's knee making impact with his face. Basle lost their bite after the he went off injured in the 25th minute.

Porto took their time to get going but began stringing some moves together and although the did not seriously test Tomas Vaclik before half-time, it was a different story after the break as they controlled the game.

The visitors had a half-chance to level on the hour mark as they started to apply the pressure but Jackson Martinez was thwarted by the home defence as he was floored in the box while referee Clattenburg waved play-on, before Danilo sent the ball flying over the crossbar and into the stands.

The away side continued to push and Cristian Tello had the ball in the back of the net 10 minutes before the break although the offside flag had already gone up.

It looked as if Julen Lopetegui's men had got onto the scoresheet two minutes into the second half as Tello's corner found Maicon at the far post, whose header was punched out by Vaclik before the ball fell to the feet of Brazil midfielder Casemiro to volley home.

But seconds later the goal was disallowed after a brief exchange of words between Clattenburg and his assistant, and the English referee ruled the goal out after saying the Porto players had impeded the goalkeeper in an offside position.

Czech stopper Vaclik was forced to parry Tello's close-range shot out for a corner as the game approached the hour mark, while - five minutes later - Martinez came close to netting a leveller with a great chance but he fired too high with his close-range effort and instead found the roof of the net.

With just over 10 minutes remaining, Porto levelled through Danilo's penalty after former Inter defender Samuel went to ground in his own box and was unable to avoid handling the ball on the deck.

Danilo made it look easy as he took the resulting spot-kick with a cool short run to fire into the bottom-left of the goal and beat the diving Vaclik as the visitors' pressure finally paid off.

Both sides seemed content to play out for a draw in the end, though the Portuguese side are surely favourites.
