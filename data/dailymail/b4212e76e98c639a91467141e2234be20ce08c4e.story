They are the ‘discontented’ and ‘resentful’ English.

Those who identify themselves as English rather than British are more likely to be Eurosceptic and suspicious of the Scots.

Most of them, who live in England, believe the EU is a ‘bad thing’, with 58 per cent saying they would vote to leave.

Seven out of ten who believe they are English and not British, would vote to leave the EU in a referendum.

Britishness is also declining as a sense of identity for many in England, the Future of England Survey run by the IPPR think tank and Cardiff and Edinburgh universities, found.

While people in England have a strong sense of dual identity, they are increasingly saying they are English rather than British.

Those who sees themselves as English rather than British are more likely to be sceptical about the EU, according to new research

The results, from a poll of over 3,500 people living in England will cause jitters in Downing Street.

David Cameron is supporting the campaign to keep the union ahead of a Scottish vote on independence next year.

There is also strong link between Euroscepticism and concerns over the ‘unfairness’ of devolution.

Those who oppose membership of the EU or have concerns are also more likely to believe that Scotland ‘gets more than its fair share of public spending’ (72 per cent) and that Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on laws that only affect England (91 per cent).

Yet just 30 per cent of the English want Scotland to become an independent country, with 49 per cent wanting it to stay in the union.

The survey also showed that respondents named UKIP as the party that is best placed to ‘stand up for English interests’.

Experts said the report showed that the main political parties have not done enough to address the growing importance of the politics of English nationhood.

Nick Pearce, IPPR director, said: ‘English identity is on the rise and it is increasingly expressed in terms that are resentful of both the EU and the devolution settlement. Attitudes towards England’s two unions are related and two sides of the same coin of English discontent.’

He added that mainstream parties had to ‘embrace Englishness, take it seriously, and find new ways of giving it political expression.

'Labour and progressive politics need to recognise that Englishness is not something to be feared or abandoned to those on the margins of right wing politics.

But the longer this debate is ignored, or worse, denied, the more likely we will see a backlash within England against the UK.'

Richard Wyn Jones, Professor of Politics at Cardiff University and co-author of the report, said: ‘Alienated from both Europe and the other nations of the UK, and especially Scotland, the English appear increasingly discontented with their lot.

Yet the British political class seems largely unable to recognise that there’s a problem let alone suggest relevant solutions.

'This report should stand as a stark warning. It’s high time that England and Englishness receive due recognition from the political system.’
