Jodi Arias is tweeting criticism of her murder trial's prosecutor from behind bars, it was claimed today.

Fox News reports that Arias, who has admitted to killing her boyfriend Travis Alexander in 2008, appears to be tweeting criticism about Juan Martinez.

The account is managed by Arias' friend, Donavan Bering, who updates the account with messages from Arias after speaking to the accused killer on the phone, Fox reported.

Martinez has attempted to portray Arias as a manipulative liar and the two have had stormy encounters in court.

At
one point the prosecutor shouted and jabbed his finger at her when she 
claimed to be unable to remember key details of the killing.

'Hmm... Anger Management problems anyone?,' reads one of the tweets on the account.

Another
reads, 'Those afflicted with Little Man's Syndrome taint society's 
perception of genuinely good men who happen to be vertically 
challenged.'

On Wednesday 
night, Bering reportedly posted a link to Arias' personal website, where
she is selling and holding auctions for artwork.

Arias says the killing was self-defense, and that on the day of Travis Alexander's death in June 2008 at his suburban Phoenix home, he attacked her and she was forced to fight for her life.

However, no other evidence — other than Arias' accounts — has been presented at trial showing Alexander had ever been physically violent.

Authorities say Arias planned the attack. She initially denied involvement then blamed it on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, she said it was self-defense.

She faces a possible death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder.

A Maricopa County Sheriff's Office spokesman told MyFoxPhoenix.com they are aware of the activity on the Twitter account but are unable to do anything about it.

trial, but at one point he screamed at Arias when talking 
about the timing that she claims is the truth

Arias is facing the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder of Travis Alexander.

The trial began in January and has 
become a cable TV and tabloid sensation with tales of sex, betrayal, 
religion and a bloody killing, attracting a following of thousands who 
can watch it streamed live via the web.

Authorities
say Arias planned the attack on her lover in a jealous rage, slitting 
his throat from ear to ear, shooting and stabbing him in the shower.

During 18 days 
on the witness stand, Arias described an abusive childhood, including 
her father belittling her mother, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a 
shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he 
had grown physically violent in the months leading to his death.

However,
there has been no testimony, other than Arias', and no evidence at 
trial to corroborate the defendant's claims that Alexander had ever been
physically violent in the past.

Alexander
suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, was shot in the head and had his 
throat slit. Arias' palm print was found in blood at the scene, along 
with her hair and nude photos of her and the victim from the day of the 
killing.

Arias said she 
recalls Alexander attacking her in a fury after a day of sex. She said 
she ran into his closet to retrieve a gun he kept on a shelf and fired 
in self-defense but has no memory of stabbing him.

She
acknowledged trying to clean the scene, dumping the gun in the desert 
and working on an alibi to avoid suspicion. She said she was too scared 
and ashamed to tell the truth at the time but insists she isn't lying 
now.
