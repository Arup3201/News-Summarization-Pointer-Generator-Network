Amy Hickson, 20, had admitted possessing extreme pornographic images involving animals as well as 600 indecent images of children when she was 17

A woman is facing prison after she admitted possessing 'extreme' pornographic images involving animals and more than 600 indecent images of children when she was 17-years-old.

Amy Hickson, now 20, of Alresford in Hampshire, admitted 13 charges which included making indecent photos of a child and possessing prohibited images and a movie of children. 

Hickson also admitted possessing 16 pornographic images involving animals which were classed as 'extreme, disgusting or obscene,' Winchester Crown Court heard. 

The offensive images included one showing a person performing a sexual act with a dog and 15 involving other animals. 

The court heard the images showed sexual acts being carried out in an 'explicit or realistic' manner. 

Hickson, of New Cheriton, changed her plea today just before she was due to stand trial.

She admitted all 13 charges. 

All of the offences took place between June 2011 and February 2013. 

During this period Hickson would have been a teenager and as young as 17. 

The charges included eight counts of making indecent photographs of a child - one count alone involving 596 images.  

One charge was for making indecent pseudo photographs of a child.

Hickson also admitted a further two counts of possessing indecent photographs of a child and admitted the two charges of possessing extreme pornographic images involving animals.

The images were from all three categories; A, B and C - which indicate different levels of seriousness. 

Category A refers to pictures showing penetration and images involving an animal or sadism. 

Those covered by B include images involving non-penetration. 

C is the least serious, and is used for images not covered by the first two categories.

Judge Susan Evans QC said: 'You will receive some credit for your guilty pleas.

'I am not going to say how much at this stage and I am going to adjourn this case for a pre-sentence report.' 

Hickson was granted conditional bail to appear back at court on March 6. 

Winchester Crown Court heard Hickson possessed images in all three categories of seriousness; A, B and C
