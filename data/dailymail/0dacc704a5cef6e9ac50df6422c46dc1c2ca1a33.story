When 19 stone Kristina Miles planned to slim down, she hoped she would look and feel sexier than ever.

However the newly-wed from Ipswich, Suffolk,who lost  9 stone over five years, said losing the weight has destroyed her sex life.

The 23-year-old, who went from a size 24 to a 14, said she was horrified after shedding the pounds left her with the 'body of a granny' due to excess skin.

Kristina says she is so unhappy with her current figure that not only does she not feel sexier but finds it difficult to be intimate with her husband Ashley. 

The slimmer has been turned down for skin removal surgery on the NHS and fears her only option to look attractive again is to gain the weight she lost to save her marriage.

Kristina, who is a mother of three (two daughters aged five and one, and a son aged 4) said: 'I cannot stay like this. It's like being locked in a prison of skin.

'I just wanted to look good on my wedding day but dieting for my wedding has destroyed everything.

The NHS has refused Kristina to have her skin removed and she says she can't afford the surgery herself

The 23-year-old decided to shed the pounds after she struggled to find a dress for her wedding day - pictured left and right before the weight loss

'I felt like I was hiding a big secret under my wedding dress. Everyone told me I looked lovely but they had no idea of the horror underneath.'

Kristina added that not only did her appearance ruin her wedding day but has also affected her marriage.

'My husband was marrying a granny. The first year of our married life has been horrific. I want to feel normal again. Some days I wish I could cut it all off myself.'

Kristina shed the pounds in a bid to look good for her wedding to Ashley, who she met after splitting from the dad of her first child, Dylan.

Kristina says that not only did her excess skin ruin her wedding day but it has also had a big impact on her first year of married life as she has felt ashamed of the way she looks

She was spurred on to get slim after her first attempt to buy a wedding dress ended in disaster because none would fit. 

'I took one into the changing rooms and I was puffing and panting trying to get it on. I was bright red, sweating and close to tears. In the end I just pulled it off and ran out of the shop.'

Kristina worries that the only way she can feel normal is to put the weight she lost back on

After several successful weeks of dieting, her GP prescribed medication to boost her weight loss and soon she was shedding one stone per month. 

Kristina's weight loss was a huge success seeing her go from a size 24 to a size 14. But Kristina noticed that as more fat melted away, it left behind saggy skin. 

On the day of her wedding, she was close to tears as she had to tuck the excess skin into her knickers.

'I should have felt a million dollars because I had made it to a size 14. But I felt disgusting. I was hiding the body of a pensioner.'

She smiled happily for photographs but says she was dreading the wedding night.

'It should have been such a special night but I felt too self-conscious to enjoy it. I felt sexier when I was fatter. I felt like a freak but Ashley told me not to be daft.'

After the wedding, still feeling self conscious Kristina hoped that by continuing to diet believing that would shrink her skin

But even after slimming down a further two dress sizes to a size 10 and weighing in at 10st 2lbs, Kristina was left with drooping skin around her stomach. 

Desperate for a solution she saw her GP who agreed to refer her for an apronectomy to remove the loose skin on her stomach.

But the referral was rejected and now Kristina is at a loss at what to do as she is unable to afford the procedure herself. 

'We don't have the money for private surgery. It would cost at least £10,000.'

She admits that in her darkest moments she is tempted to start eating junk again to fill out the empty folds.

'It means I would have lost all the weight for nothing but how can I live looking like this? I feel constantly sick with shame and anxiety.'
