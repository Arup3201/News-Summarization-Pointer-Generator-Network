Cruel: Sidra Fatima ran the scam for nearly two years, conning seven men out of £35,000

A conwoman who posed as a 'simple and sincere' potential bride in order to trick men out of money on an Asian marriage website has escaped jail.

Sidra Fatima, 33, carried on her cruel charade for nearly two years, and in that time managed to pull the wool over the eyes of seven men, getting them to part with over £35,000.

But the mother-of-two from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire today avoided jail, being given a 12-month suspended sentence despite the judge saying her suitors 'had to put up with humiliation, debt and misery'.

Fatima said she was divorced and looking for a husband 'who knows the meaning of love' on dating website Shaadi.com.

But she was already married, setting up the scam with her husband Raja Haider Ali, 45.

Once they found a victim Fatima would arrange to meet him and occasionally meet their families.

Ali would often chaperone Fatima while pretending to be her cousin or brother

John Harrison, prosecuting, today told Bradford Crown Court that Fatima even had two profiles on the website to enable the defendants to catch more hopeful men in their trap'.

At the top of one of her pages Fatima described herself as 'simple and sincere'.

Mr Harrison said: 'The various suitors were not told that Fatima and Ali were married. Following the initial meeting, Fatima would agree to marriage.

'She would then insist that the complainant hand over money to pay for the wedding and also to purchase items to for the wedding to give to her in the form of a dowry.

'After purchases had been made and money handed over, Fatima would terminate the relationship, either by telling the complainant that she no longer wished to pursue the relationship of by simply not returning his phone calls.

'The defendants made significant sums from this fraudulent activity.'

Misery: Potential suitors were left humiliated and deeply in debt by Sidra Fatima (left). Her husband Raja Haider Ali (right) threatened men who ask for their money back, telling them he had murdered 20 people in Pakistan

On one occasion, when a suitor asked for his money back, Ali threatened him, telling him he had murdered 20 people in Pakistan and showing him a picture of an AK-47 machine gun on his phone.

Some of the young men they targeted were left 'burdened by debt' as a result of the scam.

Reading from one victim impact statement Mr Harrison said: '[The victim] is still traumatised and embarrassed and has lost the faith and confidence in himself.'

Reading from another, he said: 'She [Fatima] convinced him that she was a good person. He was convinced she was telling the truth and spent all his savings on her.'

One victim said in his statement: 'She is good at using emotional blackmail so I spent more on her than I wanted to.'

Unemployed Fatima and her taxi driver husband pleaded guilty in the middle of their trial last year.

The court heard the marriage scam was part of a variety of fraud offences committed by Fatima and Ali.

Sentencing Fatima to a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two-years and Ali to two-and-a-half years in jail, Judge Colin Burn said: 'You both benefited from these frauds and it is clear you lived a very comfortable lifestyle.'

'You cheated suitors who had to put up with humiliation, debt and misery.'

The court heard when arrested a Jaguar car was in Fatima’s drive and a Volvo was in Ali’s garage.

Fatima had previously admitted providing false details about her employment and income in relation to a £171,000 mortgage fraud involving a former home.

The pair had also admitted charges involving insurance claims for three 'staged burglaries' at the same property.

Ali, who also goes under three other different names, had admitted six of the marriage deceptions committed between May 2009 and January 2011.

He also admitted fraud charges in relation to money he obtained from a man who he thought would buy their house.
