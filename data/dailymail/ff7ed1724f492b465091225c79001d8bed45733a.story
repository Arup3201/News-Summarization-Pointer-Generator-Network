Feeling down: Men feel less attractive if their partner takes the oral contraceptive, a study claims

It has been blamed for altering women’s moods – but it seems the Pill also has an impact on their male partners.

Men feel less attractive if their wife or girlfriend takes the oral contraceptive, a study claims.

British and Dutch researchers studied 14 women who were on the Pill, then stopped taking it.

They were asked how attractive they felt – and their partners were asked how they saw them.

The men were also asked how they rated their own looks.

The team found being on the Pill made no difference to how a woman saw herself. 

However, the men felt more attracted to women when they were not on the Pill, which is taken by three million Britons. 

The researchers say this could be because the treatment stops hormonal fluctuations that make a woman particularly fertile at certain times in a monthly cycle.

At these times, said Kelly Cobey, of Stirling University, women display subtle cues, such as clear skin and flirty behaviour, that men respond to subconsciously by feeling attracted to them.

So why did a partner on the Pill make men feel less attractive?

The scientists said men’s sense of their own appeal is based on their partner’s looks.

Differing perspectives: Alternatively, being on the Pill makes no difference to how a woman sees herself

When women are off the Pill, men are more attracted to them.

As a result, they get an ego boost that makes them feel good about themselves, they suggest.

In the journal Biological Psychology, Dr Cobey said the results should not affect use of the Pill, but said ‘subtle psychological effects’ may have been overlooked.
