Two friends have been branded racist after 'blacking up'  as tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams for a carnival parade.

Kevin Stevens, 50, a local pub landlord, and his friend Jason Luke, 31, a builder, covered themselves in dark fake tan, brown face paint and afro wigs to join a tennis-themed carnival float.

They  put on women's sports gear and were photographed posing enthusiastically with tennis rackets at the procession in Truro last weekend. Mr Stevens also sported a pair of fake breasts for the event.

'Stereotype': Mr Stevens, posing above in Truro, was criticised by the Council for Racial Equality

'I don't get it': Mr Luke, pictured, has said that he doesn't understand the criticism levelled at his outfit

Since the event they have been lambasted by spectators and carnival organisers, who called their costumes 'inappropriate', 'out-of-date and offensive'.

The pair have denied that they are racist and apologised for any offence - though one of the two said he 'doesn't get the racial side of it' and characterised the criticism as 'political correctness gone mad.' 

Sara Batchelor, 33, who watched the carnival with her nine-year-old son, said: 'That sort of caricature went out in the 70s. I didn't realise people still did that. It's out of date and offensive.'

'Tennis stars': Mr Stevens and Mr Luke were part of a carnival float linked to a local pub, and were raising money for charity

Truro residents took to the carnival's Facebook page to complain.

Andrew Harris asked: 'Why didn't somebody point out to the white man blacked up as Venus Williams that it was not funny or acceptable?'

Dean Harvey, from the Council for Racial Equality in Cornwall, said: 'The whole concept of blackened face is steeped in racial prejudice and stereotype from minstrels to golliwogs.

'It is not just a bit of fun, it is offensive to people of all ethnicities and it's time we moved on from this.

'These two guys were not representative of Cornwall, only unfortunately serving to remind us of times gone by that we should acknowledge and move on from.'

Carnival organisers banned pictures of the men from the Facebook page and the chairman of the event's committee, Claire Arymar, has spoken with Mr Stevens, who runs the Miners Arms pub in nearby Redruth.

New rules: Carnival organisers have promised to vet each costume next year to avoid a repeat incident

Concern: Many who went to watch the carnival, which took place on Saturday, later complained online

Mrs Arymar said: 'It was inappropriate and had I seen them at the beginning of the carnival I would never have let them go.

'I don't think it was their intention to offend people but it was ill-thought-out.'

She added that she will personally check each person's costume next year.

However,  Mr Luke today defended his choice of costume, which he was wearing to raise money for charity.

He told MailOnline: 'I'm deeply upset by the story - at the end of the day we were trying to support a local carnival that had died a death and we're trying to revive.

'We're trying to raise a bit of money for children with cancer - a whole bunch of us went as famous tennis players and I really don't see the issue.

'Quite often me might do things a bit close to the bone - but in this case it didn't even enter my head. I don't get it.'

'Like something from the 70s': Truro locals complained that the pair should have known better than to don the racially-sensitive costumes

'We put brown face paint on ourselves - I wonder if the A-Team had come through behind us with a Mr T they would have been singled out as well.

'I don't get the racial side of it - we didn't set out to offend anyone... It's political correctness gone mad in my opinion.' 

When asked about the costumes Mr Stevens said: 'I have upset people and I am very sorry, all the guys are devastated and myself especially because I have black friends.

'I don't want anybody looking at us and thinking we are racists because that's not the type of people we are.

'We never set out to upset anybody. I didn't know we were doing anything untoward.

'From my heart, we will genuinely learn from this.'
