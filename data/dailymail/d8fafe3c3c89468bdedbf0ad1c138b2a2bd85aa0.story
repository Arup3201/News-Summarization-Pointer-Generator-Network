Today show host Matt Lauer has finally exacted his revenge on Ellen DeGeneres by filling her car with 20,000 ping pong balls after weeks of being hilariously pranked by the comedian.

The 57-year-old journalist shared a video montage of Ellen's past tricks, which included a spoof video which made it look as though Matt had interviewed the stars of Fifty Shades of Grey while wearing a leather harness and not much else, before showing his act of retaliation.

'I vowed I would get revenge, and the moment has finally arrived,' Matt said this morning on the show. 

Epic prank: Ellen DeGeneres used FaceTime to show Matt Lauer the damage he had done after he had her Porsche filled with 20,000 ping pong balls as a joke 

Huge mess: When the 57-year-old opened the door to her car, thousands of ping pong balls came streaming out

Matt explained that he and his colleagues have been the targets of several of Ellen's pranks in the past few weeks, before noting that it all 'ends today'.

He then showed some footage of the Today crew filling Ellen's black Porsche Cayenne with 20,000 ping pong balls which had pictures of him posed with Ellen printed on them, while she filmed an episode of her talk show inside.

Matt even had the crew place a life-size cardboard cut-out of himself in one of the front seats, so that Ellen would have no doubt about who was responsible for the mischievous prank.

They also changed her license plate to read 'Lotta Balls'.

In shock: Ellen was in disbelief when she first saw her car that was stuffed to the brim 

Next step: She didn't know what else to do except open the door to her car and lets the ping pong balls out

When Ellen walked into the parking lot and saw her car, she yelled: 'Seriously? I mean seriously.'

She opened the door of her car and thousands of ping pong balls spilled out, revealing Matt’s cardboard cut-out.

'I'll get you Matt Lauer,' she continued. 'Damn you Lauer! He is littering. This is against the law.

Ellen went on to search for the camera that was capturing the hilarious moment.

'You think you can just do this?’ she asked. ‘Uh-uh.'

Someone eventually brought Ellen and iPad so she could FaceTime Matt.

Act of revenge: While she tried to clean out her car, Ellen vowed to get Matt back for his trick 

Starting to worry: While talking to Matt on FaceTime, Ellen told him that her previous pranks were just fun and games. 'Now it's on Lauer,' she warned him 

'Have you seen this?’ she asked him.

She added: 'Oh, I am great. We were just about to start a beer pong tournament, so I needed like 20,000 ping pong balls, so the jokes on you Lauer.’

'You have to admit Ellen; it took a lot of balls to pull off this prank,' Matt replied.

Ellen revealed that she had already filmed another spoof video starring Matt that very day and suggested that he watch her show.

'I can't watch the show tomorrow because I am entering the witness protection program in the morning,' he joked. 'Can I just end by telling you the obvious? I adore you.'

Buckle up: Ellen tried to get into her car despite it still being filled with thousands of ping pong balls 

All ready: She managed to close the door, but she knew that there was no way she could drive her Porsche home in this condition 

More fun: Ellen then opted to jump out of the car and swim into the pile of ping pong balls that had fallen out

And while Ellen said that she adored him as well, she warned him that he has raised the stakes – and hinted that he should prepare himself for an impressive round of retaliatory revenge pranks.

'Before it was fun and games. It was jokes,' she said. 'Now it is on Lauer.'

Ellen tried to get into her car and drive home, but quickly realized it was impossible, and instead opted to abandon her attempt in favour of swimming through the ping pong balls that surrounded her car in the parking lot.

Back in the studio, Matt revealed he was having second thoughts about pulling a joke on the master prankster.

Making plans: The Today show crew can be seen filling Ellen's car while she was in the Warner Bros. studios taping her talk show

Personal touch: The ping pong balls even featured a small picture of Matt and Ellen on them 

'You know the definition of a nano second?’ he asked his co-hosts. 'It is the period of time between feeling good about getting her back and fearing for your life.'

Savannah Guthrie noted: ' I thought it was on before.'

'That was supposed to be closure for you,' Carson Daly added.

And to prove that his prank was all in good fun, Matt revealed that he never intended to leave Ellen stranded.

The feud continued: Even before she knew about Matt's prank, Ellen had another trick up her sleeve. Her latest spoof video made it look like 81-year-old Florence Henderson was tearing off his close on the Today show

Funny moment: At one point during the striptease, Ellen made it look like Florence's bra was flung onto Al Roker's head

He had both a car service and a clean-up crew waiting nearby, so Ellen could get a ride home and her Porsche cleaned.

During the segment, Matt and his co-hosts also showed a clip of Ellen's latest spoof video, which showed Matt and 81-year-old actress Florence Henderson tearing each other's clothes off on the Today show. At one point a red bra was flung on to Al Roker's head.

'This is becoming a great feud,' Savannah said before asking Ellen to leave Matt's colleagues, including herself, out of it.

But Al wanted to have a united front.

'You prank one of us, you prank all of us,' he said.
