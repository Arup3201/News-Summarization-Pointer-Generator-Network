An aristocrat attacked a businessman and a security guard at a luxury hotel while drunkenly ranting: ‘You brown people are ruining Britain.’

Baroness Marie-Claire Von Alvensleben’s rampage at the Belgravia Sheraton in London ended with her spending 15 hours in a police cell.

The 60-year-old had been arrested for obstructing police who cornered her at a nearby hotel, a court heard yesterday.

Adam Sumel, a Canadian businessman, 
was the first victim of her racist tirade in the bar at the Sheraton.

He slapped him across the hands five times and said: ‘N****** should 
not be allowed here – you brown people are ruining Britain.’

Tom
 Gill, prosecuting, told Hammersmith magistrates that the guard, Haliz 
Hamza, then stepped in. ‘He spoke to the defendant because other guests 
complained about her behaviour and she clenched both her fists and 
pounded his chest repeatedly,’ he said.

As Mr Hamza escorted Von Alvensleben out of the hotel, she said: ‘You have stayed here ten years, this must be India.’

The baroness carried on with a rant about ‘blacks, Arabs, Asians and Jews’.

Police were called and found her at the Diplomat Hotel.

‘She
 was intoxicated at the time, she was being obstructive to the officer,’
 said Mr Gill. ‘She was using a mobile phone as the officer tried to 
speak to her.

‘She took a 
long time to get dressed and she was abusive and aggressive to the 
officer as he tried to cuff her.’ Von Alvensleben told the officers she 
felt her drinks were spiked and did not know she should not have mixed 
alcohol with medication for depression. 

The
 society figure, who lives in Geneva and depends on the generosity of 
well-connected friends, obtained her title from a German aristocrat she 
divorced a decade ago. It dates back to 1163.

She
 has socialised with chefs Gordon Ramsay and Ian Pengelley and, at a 
restaurant awards party in 2000, was seen rolling around on the floor 
with entertainer Michael Barrymore.

She was also pictured at an event with her arm around Sebastian Sainsbury, the great grandson of the supermarket founder.  At another event she was seen posing with Italian chef Aldo Zilli.

The baroness is also a novelist and has written a series of books entitled 'Absolutely Everything About...' but her publishing firm has failed.

Jyothi Somavarapu, in mitigation, said she was penniless and was in London to collect debts from the PR company which matches buyers and sellers in the international property and art world.

She said Von Alvensleben claimed to have had no more than two glasses of wine.

‘She
 believes her drink was spiked at the bar,’ added Miss Somavarapu. ‘She 
has no recollection at all as to what happened and says it is out of 
character for her to say such things.’

She
 said Von Alvensleben had struggled following the deaths of her second 
husband and a subsequent fiance and had become forgetful, leaving her 
suitcases in airports.

‘For
 her it is shocking. She has never uttered these words before and is 
upset that those words have been quoted,’ said Miss Somavarapu.

Von
 Alvensleben told District Judge Jane Fudge she had returned to the 
hotel two days afterwards to apologise. ‘I don’t remember assaulting 
anybody,’ she claimed. ‘The police were very nasty and I retaliated.’

But
 Judge Fudge said: ‘What concerns me is the foul, unpleasant and abusive
 language used against other patrons of the hotel, there is no excuse 
whatsoever. You did use words and you continued to use those words.

‘You’ve
 got some extremely unpleasant racial abuse accompanying this and that 
concerns me. What was said was extremely unpleasant and no doubt 
extremely distressing for those around her that heard this.’

Von Alvensleben pleaded guilty to racially aggravated assault and obstructing a police officer.

The baroness was handed six weeks of imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

A Belgium-born socialite and author, Von Alvensleben has written a book called 'Absolutely! everything about Cowes The Home of World Yachting Isle of Wight'.

She is believed to be an ex-associate of British businessman Andrew Davis, founder of the Von Essen hotel group.

The 60-year-old socialite is reported to have kept her title after her divorce from a German aristocrat more than 10 years ago.

She now lives in Geneva but at the time of the attack was staying at Belgravia Sheraton hotel -  the court was told today she has no income, no savings and nowhere to stay in London so will be returning to Geneva shortly.

This is not her first brush with the law, on a previous occasion she was handed a conditional discharge for assaulting a police officer.
