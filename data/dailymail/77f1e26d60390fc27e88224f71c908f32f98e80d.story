'Christmas thief': Sean Ashelman, 24, allegedly stole the toy on December 19 to make $30

A babysitter allegedly stole a two-year-old's Christmas toy from under the tree then took it back to the store so he could pocket a $30 refund.

Police say Sean Ashelman, 24, stole a Mickey Mouse-themed table and chair set meant for young Conner Parsons while he was looking after him.

He is accused of sneaking upstairs while Conner's mother was away, finding the receipt for the gift, then returning it to a Family Dollar store near their home in Watsontown, Pennsylvania.

According to local news channel WNEP-16, Ashelman has been charged with theft, and also forgery after giving a fake signature for the refund.

The man, a former family friend, is now jailed in Snyder County jail on a $25,000 bail after being arrested over the December 19 theft.

Ashelman, who gave no fixed address, was reportedly living with friends when tracked down by police, and had left fake contact information elsewhere.

The Family Dollar store donated a new table so Conner could still have his Christmas present. 

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for December 31.
