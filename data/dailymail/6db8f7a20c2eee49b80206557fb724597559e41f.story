VisitBritain strategy director Patricia Yates said: ‘We need to encourage people to come back time after time, which in turn will mean our visitors venture out across Britain.

‘London is the global superstar of tourism destinations, a city that all around the world people want to visit.

'Because of this, we need to make sure we are inspiring them on the Britain-wide offering and informing on how easy it is to travel across the country in such a short space of time.’

Julie Chappell, director of visitlondon.com the city's official tourist guide, said: ‘London is the UK's biggest magnet for international visitors and the major draw card for tourists.

'The city is the only UK tourism market which has consistently grown above inflation and nearly two-thirds of all holiday visitors to Britain come to London.’
