A young woman who lost her leg to cancer had a new knee joint created using her left foot - which was then attached backwards.

Jordon Moody's bone cancer meant her thigh had to be amputated - with her lower leg then moved up in the place of her thigh.

The 22-year-old from Hull, East Yorkshire, now has her foot in the place of her knee, but rotated 180 degrees. 

This leaves her toes twisted backwards and her heel at the front - providing the most natural 'downwards' angle to how a normal knee bends.

She is now waiting to be fitted with a new artificial lower limb, which will be attached to the joint created from her foot.

Jordon Moody, 22, lost part of her left leg to bone cancer. She now has her left foot in the place of her knee, but rotated 180 degrees. This leaves her toes twisted backwards and her heel at the front, creating the  most natural 'downwards' angle to how a normal knee bends, ready for a prosthetic to be attached 

She needed the radical surgery after her bone cancer returned for the second time. She underwent the op at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham in July and is now adapting to life with her new limb

Miss Moody needed the operation after being diagnosed with bone cancer for a second time.

She had been studying performing arts in New York when doctors first discovered she had the disease in her thigh.

She stayed in America for the next year, undergoing chemotherapy and an operation to remove the tumour.

After being given the all-clear, she returned to England to the home she shared with her parents and two sisters.

But during a visit to her godmother in Germany last year, she suffered excruciating pain and was rushed to hospital.

Miss Moody's bone cancer meant her thigh had to be amputated - with her lower leg then moved up in the place of her thigh.

The 22-year-old from Hull, East Yorkshire, now has her foot in the place of her knee, but rotated 180 degrees.

This leaves her toes twisted backwards and her heel at the front - providing the most natural 'downwards' angle to how a normal knee bends.

She underwent the surgery at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham in July and is adapting to life with her new limb.

She is now waiting to be fitted with a new artificial lower limb, which will be attached to the joint created from her foot. 

She flew back to England and was taken to St James's Hospital in Leeds for more tests where doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and she was facing the amputation of her leg.

The 22-year-old said: 'The pain was worse than ever and I just couldn't move it.

'It was so scary, especially in light of the fact that the more times you get cancer, the less likely chemotherapy is going to work.

'In all honesty, you just have the fear that you are going to die.

'It's there in the back of your mind all the time.'

Doctors then told her she could either have a leg completely amputated or undergo the rotationplasty. 

She underwent the surgery at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham in July and is now adapting to life with her new limb.

She is now waiting to be fitted with a new artificial lower limb, which will be attached to the joint created from her foot.

Miss Moody said: 'At first after the surgery, it was awkward-looking so it was a real shock.

'It took some getting used it but now, it seems totally normal to me.

'They told me they could get rid of my thigh and use the bottom part of my leg to replace the top part and my foot would become my knee.

'They would have to turn it 180 degrees because of the way the foot bends so it would bend the same way as a knee.

'It was really hard to hear.

'When they told me I had an option to keep my leg, this wasn't what I wanted to hear.'

Miss Moody said: 'It seemed like I would have a better quality of life as I could have a prosthesis fitted.

'I have been on crutches since I had the first operation so it's been a couple of years now.

It is hoped Miss Moody will be walking unaided again before Christmas

'That's my main way of getting around and I use a wheelchair.

'Hopefully, before Christmas, I will be walking unaided again.'

She added: 'I've always been independent and I hate to feel dependent when I'm in a wheelchair or having to use the walking aids.

'There's not so much going out now but I will be able to walk unaided if I get a prosthesis so that's my aim now. That's my goal.' 

Mr Lee Jeys, an orthopedic oncology surgeon at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital, Birmingham, carried out Miss Moody's procedure.

He said: 'Jordon had already had treatment in America for a thigh tumour and unfortunately we needed to remove the whole of her thigh bone.

'Instead of leaving her without a leg, we connected her shin bone to the remaining thigh bone, creating a knee joint from her foot.

'The idea of the operation is where we turn the foot around and move it up, so Jordon could have a below the knee prosthesis.

'Otherwise she would have had to have an amputation and would have been left with no leg at all.

'It is very technical surgery and I perform it about three a year- usually on young patients.

'The aim of the surgery is so the patients can walk, and in clothes will look completely normal.

'Of course, out of clothes it looks a little unusual but we do it to offer patients the best functionality they can. Most patients will eventually be able to walk unaided.'

This provides a natural angle most similar to how a normal knee bends
