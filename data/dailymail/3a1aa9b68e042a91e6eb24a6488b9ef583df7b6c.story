Benjamin and Hope Jordan caught babysitter Alexis Khan abusing their 7-month-old son Finn after noticing the family dog acting aggressively towards her.

The couple hired 22-year-old Khan to babysit Finn when they first moved to Charleston, South Carolina last year.

She cleared a background check and the two felt she was a 'good fit' at the time.

Protecting the pack: The Jordan family dog is a hero after alerting it's owners to the child abuse that babysitter Alexis Khan was carrying out against their son, Finn

Warning signs: Finn's parents first noticed something was wrong when their dog started acting protective of their son whenever the babysitter was in the house

Caught on tape: Taking their dog's behavior seriously, the couple left an iPhone hidden underneath the couch to record how Khan treated Finn when they weren't there

Abuser: 22-year-old babysitter Alexis Khan plead guilty Monday to charges of assault and battery. She will spend one to three years behind bars and have to register as a child abuser when she gets out

'About five months into her being our baby sitter, we started to notice that our dog was very protective of our son when she would come in the door,' Benjamin Jordan told WCSC. 'He was very aggressive towards her and a few times we actually had to physically restrain our dog from going towards her.'

The couple started to worry about their dog's behavior, so one day they left an iPhone underneath the couch to record what happened while they were out.

When the returned home they sat down to listen, and what they heard was startling.

As Finn cried, Khan cursed at him saying: 'Shut up. Shut the f*** up. Shut up.'

And then there was slapping noises and Finn's cry for attention turned to a cry of pain.

'I just wanted to reach through the audio tape, go back in time and just grab him up,' Mr Jordan said.

'To know that five months I had handed my child to a monster, not knowing what was going on in my house for that day,' he said.

Mr Jordan says that without the dog, they may never have found out about the abuse.

'Had our dog not alerted us to the trouble, had my wife's instincts not said we need to make something happen, it could have been Finn that was killed by the babysitter. You never know.'

Justice: The recording allowed the couple to bring Khan to justice. She was charged with aggravated assault and battery and plead guilty to those charges Monday

Lifesaver: Finn's dad Benjamin Jordan thanks the family dog for saving his son and other children from future, potentially fatal, abuse at the hands of Khan

Never again: Khan will be eligible for parole after one year in prison, at which point she will have to register as a child abuser so she never works with children again

Good dog: The Jordan family dog definitely deserves a treat after this good deed

They say their dog helped protect Finn, but also future children from the wrath of Khan.

The babysitter plead guilty in  court Monday to charges of assault and battery.

She will have to serve at lease one year of her three year sentence and register as a child abuser which will keep her from working with children in the future.
