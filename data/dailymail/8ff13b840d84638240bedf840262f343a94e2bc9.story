Four-time graded stakes winner Caixa Eletronica and another up-and-coming racehorse have died after an awful training accident at Belmont Park in Nassau County, New York.

The tragedy occurred about 8am Saturday as Caixa Eletronica was galloping on the training track behind Six Drivers, a four-year-old New York-bred racehorse.

Six Drivers threw off his exercise rider, Julio Pezua, before the starting gate and started running loose in the wrong direction.

In a violent few moments, Six drivers crashed straight into Caixa Eletronica and his exercise rider Carlos Castro.

Tragedy: Caixa Electronica - seen here winning the True North Handicap at in Elmont in 2012 - has been killed following a head-on with another horse, Six Drivers, in a training accident on Saturday

Caixa Eletronica sustained a skull fracture and Six Drivers broke its neck in the subsequent head-on collision.

Both horses died immediately, according to chief examining veterinarian for the New York Racing Association, Dr. Anthony Verderosa.

Caixa Eletronica's exercise rider, Carlos Castro, was taken to a hospital for evaluation.

He suffered a fractured pelvis and needed reconstructive facial surgery

Six Drivers' rider, Julio Pezua, had no apparent injuries.

It's unclear whether Six Drivers had previously shown any erratic behavior.

'A true warrior': Caixa Eletronica wins the Grade II Charles Town Classic in Ranson, West Virginia, on April 14, 2012. The horse's death has been deemed a freak accident

Caixa Eletronica was owned by Mike Repole and trained by Todd Pletcher.

The nine-year-old horse won seven stakes, including the Westchester, the Charles Town Classic and the True North Handicap.

Caixa Eletronica had earned more than $1.8 million.

Repole described Caixa as 'a true warrior' and said it was 'a terrible day for racing', with many people in shock.

'I'm devastated' he told Newsday.

'For any horse, it's horrible.

'When you hear it's Caixa Eletronica, it's magnified. He was such an iron horse. For him to pass away like this makes no sense.'

Owner: Mike Repole claimed Caixa Electronica for $62,500 in March 2011 and said he is devastated by the loss

The term 'caixa eletronico' is Portuguese for 'cash machine'.

According to NewsDay, the two thoroughbreds never would have met in a race and their deaths was a freak training accident that no one could have foreseen.

Evan Gewirtz, of West Hills, claimed Six Drivers for $16,000 out of a Dec. 27 race at Aqueduct, and the bay gelding was scheduled to debut for Island Wind Racing at Aqueduct Sunday.
