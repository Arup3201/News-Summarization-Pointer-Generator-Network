Besieged by controversy over its treatment of killer whales, SeaWorld has announced plans to double the size of orca tanks and fund additional research on the species.

The proposed whale 'environment', 'Blue World Project', will have 10 million gallons of water, up from 5.6 million, and cover 1.5 hectares.

The new 50-by-350-foot deep pool, set to open at the San Diego park in 2018, will allow visitors to view the orcas in a glassed room under the water.

Today's announcement comes as the company's shares plummeted to their lowest levels since the company listed its stock on public markets last year.

Renovations: SeaWorld said it plans to build new tanks which cover 1.5 acres at 50 feet deep and 350 feet in length. The new habitat will have 10 million gallons of water (this is an artist's rendering of the plan)

 

SeaWorld said the new habitat will include 
features that will be more stimulating for the whales, including a 'fast water current' allowing the whales to swim against moving 
water. 

The facility will open to the public in 2018 (San Diego has 10 orcas), and after that, 
SeaWorld said it will make similar changes at its Orlando and San 
Antonio locations.

The company said the cost of the project will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars but would not specify the exact budget.

'Through up-close and personal encounters, the new environment will transform how visitors experience killer whales,' Jim Atchison, chief executive officer and president of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc., told LA Times.

SeaWorld has also pledged $10 million in matching funds to support research 
focused on threats to killer whales in the wild, and announced a 
multimillion-dollar partnership focused on ocean health.

SeaWorld share price

Drop: Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) fell on Wednesday (August 13) after the theme park operator reported second-quarter profit and sales that missed Wall Street expectations and cut its outlook for the year

Decline: Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) have plummeted following the release of 2013 documentary 'Blackfish' which exposed the theme park's practices of capturing and training killer whales

The announcement comes during a week in which SeaWorld's share price nose-dived, with speculation the amusement park may not recover from the fallout from 'Blackfish'.

The controversial documentary, released last year, explored the company's practices of capturing and training killer whales. It also suggested that captivity and SeaWorld's treatment of the whales provoked
 violent behavior, leading to the death and injury of trainers.

Since
 the release of the movie, several entertainers, including 
country singers Trisha Yearwood and Willie Nelson and rock band 
Barenaked Ladies, have pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld 
parks.

In July, Southwest Airlines and SeaWorld said they were ending a 25-year marketing partnership at the end of this year.

SeaWorld said the decision was mutual, and said it wants to concentrate on growing markets in Latin America and Asia.

SeaWorld stock has fallen 37 percent in 2014 and finished at $18 on Thursday.

That
 is its lowest closing price since the company went public in April 
2013. The shares gained 35 cents to $18.35 in morning trading.

On Wednesday, SeaWorld reported net 
income and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations and the 
company withdrew its financial outlook for the year.

Its
 revenue in the second quarter was about $40 million less than analysts 
had expected, and the company said 'Blackfish' hurt attendance.
