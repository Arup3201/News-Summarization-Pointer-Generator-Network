A foreign doctor who killed a young English mother during childbirth has admitted she had been drinking, telling police: ‘I need vodka so I don’t shake.’

Anaesthetist Helga Wauters, 45, is facing five years in prison after she botched a caesarean section at a French clinic last month, causing the death of 28-year-old Xynthia Hawke.

Miss Hawke, from Somerset, had moved to a small village in the Pyrenees while she was pregnant to start an idyllic new life with her French partner. 

Her baby boy, named Isaac, survived the birth but she had a fatal heart attack when a resuscitation procedure went horribly wrong.

The doctor, who was found three times over the drink-drive limit and has been charged with aggravated manslaughter, has now admitted that during the operation she went off to drink wine with friends.

That evening, she had also allegedly drunk a 500ml bottle of Vodka mixed with water and when detectives raided her home they found 17 empty bottles of the spirit.

Wauters, who is originally from Belgium and has previously admitted to having a ‘pathological alcohol problem’, told authorities in France: ‘I was not drunk, I was at 70 per cent of my capacities. 

'I need vodka so that I don’t shake.’

Miss Hawke, a prize-winning linguist, grew up in North Petherton, Somerset, before moving to France to study. 

This summer, she settled in Ustaritz, a small village near the Spanish border, after starting a relationship with Yannick Balthazar, 33, and falling pregnant.

On September 26, she went to a private clinic in nearby Orthez to give birth, having been told of its ‘good reputation’.

Her baby was too large to be delivered naturally so she had to have a C-section.

After Isaac was born, Wauters allegedly inserted a tube into Miss Hawke’s oesophagus instead of her windpipe, starving her of oxygen and causing her to suffer fatal cardiac arrest.

She was rushed to a hospital in Pau, South West France, but fell into a coma and died four days later.

Wauters had been working despite alleged difficulties with ‘expression, comprehension and reactivity’.

France’s national news agency AFP said she went off during the procedure to have ‘a glass of rosé’ with friends.

When she returned, she allegedly smelled of alcohol and admitted to being ‘in a daze’.

Staff said she was slurring her words to the extent that she ‘could not be understood and she did not seem to understand what people were saying.’ 

Miss Hawke grew up in North Petherton, Somerset, where she excelled at her comprehensive, Haygrove School, and won a prize for outstanding achievement in GCSE French

When Wauters turned up for police questioning four days later, she had 216milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of her blood - the equivalent of four bottles of wine. 

The legal limit for driving in England is 80 milligrams.

Miss Hawke’s devastated family, who live in a cottage in North Petherton, are said to have flown out to France to mourn with her partner and help him look after their child.

‘It is a very difficult time for us,’ Mr Balthazar, 33, told the Mail last week.

‘It is very sad. We are in mourning. I am looking after my family, my son, that is what is important to me now. We need to be with family now. I am going to let justice do its job.’

Miss Hawke’s parents Fraser and Clare, 61 and 56, declined to comment.

Her uncle Nigel Cromney-Hawke, from Somerset, said: ‘It’s devastating.’

Wauters’s barrister, Florence Hegoburu, warned against any ‘hasty conclusions’, adding: ‘My client will assume her responsibilities in relation to the facts that she recognises, but she is not solely responsible. 

'There are grey areas here, and the investigation will make them clearer.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.’
