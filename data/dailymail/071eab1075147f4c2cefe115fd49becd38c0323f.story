After Patrick Bamford, Joe Garner and Danny Mayor were crowned their division's player of the year on Sunday, the Football League has revealed the players who were nipping at their heels for the honour.

On-loan Chelsea striker Bamford's efforts at Middlesbrough were rewarded with the Championship award, as voted by Sky Bet Football League club managers, with his team-mates Grant Leadbitter and Lee Tomlin also in the second tier's top 10. 

Ipswich Town's Daryl Murphy was second in the voting ahead Troy Deeney, whose been in top form for Championship leaders Watford, in a list dominated by attacking players.

The Football League revealed the top ten players in each of their divisions based on votes by managers

Callum Wilson in fourth is the first of three Bournemouth players with midfielders Grant Leadbitter (seventh) and Harry Arter (10th) along with Derby's Chris Martin (sixth) and Brentford's Alex Pritchard (eighth).

For the top tens, each manager was asked to choose their top five players from this season in order before their rankings were collated to make up the final list. 

Following Preston North End's Garner in League One's top ten was MK Dons' Dele Alli, the star striker signed by Tottenham and loaned back to the club for the season who picked up Sunday's young player of the year award. 

Bristol City winger Luke Freeman was third in the voting with the work of Aden Flint (fifth), Joe Bryan (seventh) and Luke Ayling (ninth), with it hard not to assume the League One leaders were victims of their own success with so many standout players splitting the vote.
