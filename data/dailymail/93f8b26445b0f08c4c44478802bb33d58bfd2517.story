They say it's the most wonderful time of the year, but the week leading up to Christmas leaves many of us stressed out and sleep-deprived, research has shown.

According to a new study, most of us will be wishing we could ask Santa Claus to bring us a few extra hours of precious sleep as the big day looms ever closer.

A study found 45 per cent of Britons will lose 21 hours of sleep this week, while some women become so stressed out by festive preparations that when they do drop off they have Christmas-themed nightmares.

Burning the candle at both ends: Many adults will stay up late into the night this week in order to finalise last-minute Christmas preparations

Nightmares: Some women become so overwhelmed by festive preparations they have dreams about being chased by giant turkeys, a survey showed

The survey of 2,000 adults found 45 per cent of Britons will survive on a mere five hours of sleep per night over the next seven days, as time is swallowed up by late night socialising, staying up to wrap presents, or lying awake fretting over getting everything organised for Christmas Day.

1. Being attacked by a gigantic turkey

2. Being naked at the family Christmas meal

3. Passionately kissing Santa

4. Eating too much and turning into a Christmas pudding

5. Having a showdown with the mother-in law 

6. Being attacked by a Christmas tree

7. Burning the Christmas meal

8. Being surrounded by elves

9. Presents getting lost in the post

10. Cooker breaks on Christmas morning      

Not only do people go to bed later this week, four out of ten adults will rise an hour earlier each morning in order to fit more in during the day.

When Christmas Eve comes around, a fifth of parents will work through the night making up stockings, assembling new toys, and carrying out last minute preparations.

Sleep expert Chris Idzikowski, from the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, warned that sleeplessness could be as dangerous as drinking when it comes to driving or other activities that require total concentration.

'It is also advisable to drink less alcohol if you're sleep deprived as you will feel the effect a lot more,' he said.

'The more sleepy you are, the more potent the drink.'

While both sexes are likely to find their normal sleep pattern disrupted this week, it seems women suffer the most from the 'stressmas' phenomenon.

A total of 59 per cent of British women reported suffering high levels of stress in the week before Christmas, while 42 per cent declared that hosting Christmas was the most stressful job they had to undertake.

Many women also find themselves enduring festive nightmares due to the combination of stress and sleep-deprivation, the study said, with typical scary dreams ranging from being naked at the family Christmas lunch to being attacked by a gigantic turkey.

Fraught: The study showed 45 per cent of men think women make 'too much fuss' over Christmas and that they could do a better job of hosting

As if that wasn't enough, research also showed couples regularly end up rowing during the fraught pre-Christmas period.

1. Worrying about how to keep guests entertained over the festive season (32%)

2. Fretting that guests will think the house is dirty (30%)

3. Menu planning and cooking additional meals while guests stay over (29%)

4. Keeping the conversation going (28%)

5. Fear over a partner or children embarrassing them (25%)

6. The state of the spare room

7. Worrying that a guest will hear partner’s snoring     

 1. Plan ahead, think of what might happen on the day and predict what problems may arise and develop solutions to avoid them happening

 2. Give your guests a choice - don’t make people do things they don’t want to do

3. Share out the responsibility, allow others to help on the day and make them feel involved - especially children

4. The most important thing is to relax and have fun, make your expectations realistic, appreciate the time spent together with your family

The study found 45 per cent of men think women make far too much fuss over Christmas and make the day a lot more stressful than it should be, while 36 per cent believe they could do a better job of hosting the day than their partners - and that it would be stress-free.

'Stressmas': The survey found 41 per cent of women preparing to host Christmas fear their family and friends won't regard them as a domestic goddess

Meanwhile 85 per cent of women claimed men don't understand or appreciate how much work and stress goes into creating the perfect Christmas, and 41 per cent fear their family and friends will not regard them as a domestic goddess but criticise their hosting skills.

Relationship psychologist Corinne Sweet said women should stop setting themselves impossible goals by aiming for a 'perfect' Christmas.

'Stressmas can be avoided,' she said.

'Prepare yourself psychologically by lowering your expectations, Christmas can't be perfect.

'Take time out every time you feel riled.'

Ms Sweet also recommended taking a nap when the chance arises, as 'people are especially agitated on not much sleep'.

'Make space for yourself this Christmas, set boundaries with relatives and kids, and create some quiet 'me-time' to reflect on what the spirit of Christmas is really about,' she said.

According to the survey commissioned by hotel chain Travelodge, a third of women get more stressed when they have guests staying over during the festive season than they do while cooking Christmas dinner.

A quarter of female respondents said they enjoyed Christmas more then guests stayed just for the day rather than spending the night.

A further quarter of women said they didn't like having guests to stay over because it means they can't watch their favourite television programmes.
