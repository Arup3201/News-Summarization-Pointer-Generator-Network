Former Russian spy Anna Chapman has refused to answer questions about her Twitter proposal to NSA leaker Edward Snowden in a bizarre television interview.

The flame-haired femme fatale walked out of the interview with the Today show when pressed about her tweet in July, which read: 'Snowden, will you marry me?!'

Chapman, who has appeared in sultry photo shoots, walked catwalks and featured in her own television show since she was arrested in New York in 2010, insisted she wanted to keep her privacy.

'I'm not going to discuss this,' Chapman, 31, told NBC's Richard Engel in the segment that aired on Monday. 'OK, the interview is finished. I'm sorry.'

Keeping quiet: Former Russian spy Anna Chapman, pictured on the Today show, would not talk about her recent marriage proposal to Edward Snowden and insisted she is a private person

Anger: She left the interview when asked about her relationship to Snowden and the U.S.

Chapman, who was deported from the U.S. after authorities learned she was leaking information back to Russia, is now the host of a Russian show about aliens and ghosts called 'Mysteries of the World'.

Despite this new role in the spotlight, she insisted she was a private person.

'I'm a very private, discreet person and I still don't do many interviews because I just don't like to share,' she said. 'I don't believe that people would be interested in knowing about somebody's life.'

She also denied being married, saying 'everybody would know' if she was.

Proposal: Edward Snowden fled the U.S. in May after leaking sensitive government information

But she abruptly ended the five-minute interview with Engel after he asked her about the proposal to Snowden, who fled the U.S. in May and sought refuge in Moscow airport before he was granted asylum.

'I don't want to discuss America. I'm sorry,' she said. 'I think [the interview is] done because it's not going the right way.'

After she walked out the room, Engel told the Today show: 'I get the sense that somebody had told her don't go there, don't talk about this.'

Chapman, the daughter of a senior KGB agent, was arrested in 2010 with nine others, accused of working for a spy ring for Russa's external intelligence agency.

She pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was deported back to Russia in July 2010 as part of a prisoner swap. She has since become a celebrity in Russia.

After her arrest, a former boyfriend leaked explicit pictures of Chapman, which led to more sultry photo shoots for magazines.

She also appeared on the catwalk at Russian Fashion Week in Moscow clothed in a skin-tight leather ensemble, edited a magazine, given lectures and now runs a foundation.

Snowden, who left long-term girlfriend Lindsay Mills back in Hawaii when he fled the country, was holed up in the Moscow airport for weeks before he was granted asylum there in August.
