Lewis Hamilton was late for the opening practice session of the Monaco Grand Prix after he overslept.

The Mercedes man, who leads the drivers' standings after four consecutive wins, was forced to dash from his boat to the Mercedes motorhome after arriving at the Monte Carlo circuit just minutes before the start of Friday's first practice session.

But Hamilton was soon in his Mercedes, ending the session marginally faster than team-mate and rival for the championship Nico Rosberg, with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo third quickest.

In form: Mercedes man Hamilton has won the last four races, and leads Rosberg by three points

Hamilton's poor time-keeping is arguably the first mistake of what has so far been an immaculate season.

The
 29-year-old arrives in Monte Carlo leading Rosberg by three points in 
the race for the title, and he was back at the sharp end of the 
timesheets on Friday, somewhat predictably followed by his team-mate.

The top 
two may have been the same, but at least there was a whiff of a 
suggestion that the pair may not have it all their own way.

Five
 successive poles between the Mercedes duo, five straight wins and four 
consecutive one-twos have been the story of one of the most crushing 
starts to this or any other season.

After
 Rosberg produced a clean sweep last year in topping the times at the 
end of all three practice sessions, qualifying and then taking the 
chequered flag, Hamilton managed to get his nose in front on this 
occasion by just 0.032secs.

In
 posting a time of one minute 18.271secs, Hamilton finished just over 
two seconds off Rosberg's best in FP1 a year ago to underline the gap 
between last year's V8 power and this season's 1.6-litre V6 
turbo-chargers is slowly being reduced.

Behind
 them was Ricciardo, with the Australian just 0.235secs adrift, offering
 a glimmer of hope of ending Mercedes' run of results.

With
 the tight, twisty nature of the track more appropriate for high 
downforce than outright power, with Mercedes having a stranglehold on 
the latter, the former may yet come to Red Bull's aid.

There
 was a gap then, however, with Fernando Alonso in his Ferrari 0.659secs 
off the pace, followed by the second Red Bull of reigning four-times 
champion Sebastian Vettel, with the German 0.772secs down.

No
 other driver came within a second of Hamilton, with Ferrari's Kimi 
Raikkonen the best of the rest in sixth and 1.196secs behind.

McLaren's
 Jenson Button was down in 11th position, 1.762secs adrift, finishing 
two places and a quarter of a second behind team-mate Kevin Magnussen.

For his first outing around Monaco, Toro Rosso's Russian rookie Daniil Kvyat was 18th and 2.643secs down.

Marussia's
 Max Chilton, currently on a record run of 24 consecutive finishes since
 his F1 debut, managed just seven laps due to an early technical 
failure, leaving him at the bottom of the standings, 7.5secs back.
