Clean-cut: But Anders Behring Breivik had terrifyingly extreme views

The sight of Anders Behring Breivik – tall, clean-cut and dressed in a police uniform – must have at first seemed a reassuring presence to the young members of Norway’s governing Labour Party when they encountered him at their summer camp on the island of Utoya.

Until the moment he opened fire. Now the 32-year-old who reportedly shot dead at least 85 victims in cold blood, and killed another seven with the Oslo bomb, has emerged as a Right-wing extremist bitterly opposed to Norway’s tradition of open-minded liberalism.

His internet postings betray a hatred of multi-culturalism and include offensive references to ‘Somali immigrants with full Norwegian passports’ living off state benefits and sending money home to their Muslim relatives.

Little is known about his early life, however, and there is no clue so far as to why he should have resorted to such terrible acts of violence.

Breivik is thought to have grown up in comfortable circumstances and until recently lived with his mother Wenche in an affluent Oslo suburb. He studied at the city’s School of Management, which offers degrees and postgraduate courses, but it is not clear what qualification, if any, he obtained.

His former landlady in the Skoyen district of the city said last night: ‘I cannot believe he was capable of doing such a thing.’

And a man living in the same block of flats said: ‘He did not appear to be interested in speaking to people and would just walk past neighbours. I got the impression he was a mummy’s boy who did not want to leave home because he had it so good.’

Breivik had no military background beyond the national service all young Norwegians are obliged to undertake. Nor did he have a criminal record and police say they knew nothing of him until his arrest on Friday.

He was the registered holder of two weapons – a Glock pistol and an automatic rifle – both of which are thought to have been used in the massacre at Utoya.

Supplies: Several bags of fertiliser were found at Breivik's house near Oslo

Breivik moved out of Oslo two years ago and bought a farm in the town of Ostre Asta, where he set up an agricultural enterprise dealing in vegetables, melons, roots and tubers. The farm consists of a scattering of outbuildings on a grassy slope leading down to a forest-fringed lake.

It was in this tranquil setting, police believe, that Breivik planned his devastating attacks. Using the farm business as cover, he placed an order for six tons of fertiliser with a local supplier two months ago. Oddny Estenstad, a spokeswoman for the supply firm, said he seemed like any other customer.

‘He contacted us in the normal manner, ordered fertiliser and had it delivered,’ he said.

These pictures of Breivik were taken from his Facebook page, which has now been blocked

The Norwegian police and security services are investigating possible links between Breivik and European far-Right groups, including the English Defence League.

He is thought to have posted messages on a Norwegian website expressing admiration for the EDL and an extremist group called Stop Islamification of Europe.

It is Breivik’s online profile that has provided the authorities with  most information about him so far.

His Facebook page, which was blocked soon after the killings, listed his interests as bodybuilding, ‘conservative politics’ and freemasonry. He also had a liking for violent video games and American TV drama series Dexter, about a forensic blood spatter pattern expert with the Miami police who hunts down and kills criminals in his spare time.

Breivik set up a Twitter account last week in which he hijacked a quotation by the 19th Century British libertarian and philosopher John Stuart Mill.

Mill said: ‘One person with a belief is equal to a force of 99 who have only interests.’ Breivik changed this to: ‘One person with a belief is equal to a force of 100,000 who have only interests.’

In another message, he expressed concern about the effects of immigration on Norwegian society. ‘There are political forces in Oslo who want mass-subsidised and low-cost “Islam-blocks” in Oslo West for “better integration”,’ he wrote.

And on his contacts with the English Defence League, he wrote: ‘I have on some occasions discussed with . . . the EDL and recommended them to use conscious strategies. The tactics of the EDL is to “entice” an overreaction from Jihad Youth/Extreme Marxists – something they have succeeded several times [with] already.’

In another posting, dated December 2009, Breivik claimed there was no country where Muslims lived peacefully alongside non-Muslims.

According to friends, Breivik began to espouse extremist views in his late 20s. But he was also a member of the second largest party in the Norwegian parliament from 1999 to 2004. Other members of the centre-right Progress Party described him as ‘a modest person who seldom engaged in political discussions’.

But Breivik appears to have become disillusioned with mainstream politics. He wrote in one internet message that ‘the vast majority of new faces in the Progress Party are now politically-correct career politicians and not in any way idealists who are willing to take risks and work for idealistic goals’.

Last night, however, the authorities were still trying to establish a motive for the killings.

As Breivik was charged with multiple counts of murder, police said his internet postings suggested he had ‘some political traits directed towards the right and anti-Muslim views’.

‘But whether that was a motivation for the actual act remains to be seen,’ they added.

ANALYSIS BY DAVID WILSON

The savage, blood-soaked massacre in Norway might seem like the act of a deranged madman. But the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, was nothing of the sort.

In fact, he appears to have been an intelligent, well-educated individual and a competent businessman, who owned a successful farm. Nothing in either his life story or even in this unprecedented atrocity smacks of wild insanity.

Just the opposite. He planned the whole operation with utter ruthlessness and precision, from using fertiliser from his farm to make the bomb that was planted at the government’s offices in Oslo, to disguising himself as a policeman to gain access to the island summer camp.

Fatal: Seven people were killed in the Oslo bomb blast (pictured)

Even as he carried out the mass shooting, he did not exhibit the behaviour of a frenzied lunatic. Instead, he coldly beckoned his victims towards him and then, like an iron-willed executioner, systematically fired at them.

Tellingly, unlike so many spree killers, including Britain’s own Derrick Bird in Cumbria and Thomas Hamilton in Dunblane, he did not shoot himself, but instead allowed the police to take him into custody.

The fact that Breivik was able to perpetrate this monstrous deed is partly a reflection of the extremely liberal gun laws that operate in Scandinavia. Much of this huge region is a wilderness, dominated by the untamed forces of nature, and, as a result, the ownership of firearms for hunting and self-protection is widely accepted, just as in the US the freedom to carry guns is an integral part of society.

It was this freedom that gave Breivik his easy access to high-calibre weaponry Moreover, his work as a farmer meant that he could acquire fertiliser for his bomb-making without raising any suspicions.

But ease of access does not explain why he acted as he did. After all, despite the prevalence of guns, there has never previously been a crime like this in Norway and even in wider Scandinavia such mass shootings are extremely rare. The only comparable recent events were massacres in Finland at Tuusula in 2007 and Kauhajoki in 2008.

Scandinavia has extremely low overall rates of crime and murder compared with most advanced countries in the Western world. Yet it is a fundamental paradox of Scandinavia that, for all the region’s stability and order, there are deep-seated anxieties about crime and social disintegration. Beneath the tranquil surface lurks a dark spirit of foreboding.

That is why there is such an appetite in Scandinavia for the violent crime-fiction genre that conveys this atmosphere of menace, as demonstrated by the smash-hit Danish TV series The Killing or the novels of Stieg Larsson, such as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Norway has its own acclaimed writer of bestselling thrillers, Jo Nesbo.

His fictional blond, blue-eyed detective Harry Hole specialises in catching spree killers.

This widespread disquiet has been driven partly by concerns that Norway’s national identity and traditional culture are under threat from mass immigration, multiculturalism and militant Islam. Many fear that the social contract of mutual responsibility which once built Scandinavia’s famously generous welfare system is now dissolving in the more fluid, globalised world.
