Some travellers prefer to make an effort integrating with the local culture when visiting a foreign country. Others will just be themselves and look after number one.

But for those who are keen to 'fit in' abroad, it's important to do some research first.

These infographics are a handy reminder of what not to do when on holiday, and will help travellers not to upset the locals.

For example, in Mexico, taking an expensive gift to someone's home is a no-no - as it can be seen as a bribe. Flowers, chocolates or other such subtle gifts are accepted.

But no marigolds in Mexico - they are associated with death and witchcraft. 

You have to be careful with your gift of flowers in Germany too - steer clear of carnations as they are associated with funerals. It's always best in this situation to ask the host what their favourite flowers are in advance.

No-one likes an angry chef, so when visiting France, you better not be caught cutting your lettuce with a knife and fork as it is seen as an insult to the preparation of the salad.

And it's best to tone down your friendly nature when you visit Italy - the locals are more reserved and extended conversation with a stranger can be seen as threatening.

It may have been used in the 1960s and 1970s, but flashing the 'peace sign' in the UK isn't the best idea - depending at what angle it is viewed, it turns into something rather offensive.

The lesson here is basically, when in doubt, don't do it. That's not to say when visiting foreign countries you have to keep yourself to yourself, but that it's always good to self-educate first. 

Oonagh Shiel, spokesman for Cheapflights.com, which compiled the infographic, said: 'Part of the fun of travelling is going outside your comfort zone and seeing the differences between cultures – but it’s important to be aware of your surroundings to avoid offending your hosts.

'Who’d have thought giving a gift in Mexico could be misconstrued, that carnations might go down badly in Germany – or that folding your lettuce in France could save your blushes? 

'It seems that when you’re travelling, "food can be rude" – but with some simple tips it’s easy to ensure things go smoothly; after all, "when in Rome"....'
