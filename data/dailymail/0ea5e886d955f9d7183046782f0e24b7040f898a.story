Astonishing footage has revealed the dramatic moment that a snorkeler was saved by a passing surfer just moments before a strong Hawaii current would have claimed his life.

The rescue was captured on the swimmer's water-proof video camera, which appears to be attached to his head as he snorkels just off Paniau Beach in Puako.

The film, which was found along the shore two weeks after the rescue, reveals him struggling against a strong tide as he moans quietly for help and bobs up and down in the water.

Approach: A snorkeler off the Big Island of Hawaii found himself in trouble in strong currents and his head camera filmed a surfer swimming to help him just at the right moment

Rescuer: The surfer, Zach Sato, and his friend pass a surfboard for the struggling swimmer to hold on to

Suddenly, through the foggy lens, an approaching surfer can be seen.

The surfer, Zach Sato, told KITV4 that he had swam nearby to check on the man when he saw him raise his hand all the way up.

'Hold on to the board, lay on the board!' Sato and his friend urge as the man moans.

'Thirty seconds more, 90 per cent chance he would have died,' Sato said. He looked 'like pure blue kind of swollen and his eyes were barely there - almost rolled back.'

Safety: The camera shows the man being pulled to the shore after he was overwhelmed by the current

Relief: As he sees the rocks, he knocks off the camera - and it was found 2 weeks later by a passerby

The two men pulled the man safely to shore using the surfboard and the video captures the rocks as they get closer to the beach.

At this point, the man knocks off the camera and it falls into the water.

'The guy was pretty much heaving,' Sato said. 'He couldn't even hold himself up.'

It is not known if the man received medical care, but Sato did not get his name and does not know his identity. KITV4, which published the video exclusively, also did not know who he was.

Questions: Zach Sato, left, rescued the man on his surfboard two weeks ago and passerby Aaron Smith, right, found his camera along the shore - but the identity of the snorkeler is still not known

Two weeks later, passerby Aaron Smith was at the beach when he found the camera and watched in horror as he played the scenes back.

'When you see the video for the first time and you don't know the outcome, it's terrifying,' he said. 'Luckily the surfer came into view. [I] breathed a sigh of relief.'
