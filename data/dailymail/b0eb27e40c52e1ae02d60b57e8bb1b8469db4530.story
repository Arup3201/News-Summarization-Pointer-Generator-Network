An inspirational Chinese woman who refused prosthetic limbs after losing her feet in a childhood accident now walks miles to work everyday- on her knees. 

Every morning, Hu Fenglian, wraps her stumps with cloth before adding a pair of rubber 'shoes' made out of old bus tires.

She then shuffles for miles on her knees to get from her home deep in the mountains of southern China's Guangxi Province, to her job in the local village's lumberyard- earning her the local nickname of 'Sister Strong-Will'.

Hu Fenglian, pictured walking along the street in Guangxi Province, China, has learnt to walk on her knees after a childhood accident left her with no feet and shortened legs

Hu was just six months old when she was severely injured after falling into a home heating stove leaving her with no feet and only partial lower legs.

She was offered the chance of a pair of prosthetic legs but said she found them too uncomfortable.

'After wearing them, my legs would swell, painful and inflammable. I had to quit them,' she explained. 

Then tragedy struck again in 1982, when her husband abandoned her and the family, leaving her to support their four-month-old baby. 

When Hu was only 6 months old, she had accidentally fallen into a home heating stove and severely injured her lower legs

 But the 50-year-old refuses to let her disability stop her and is even able to work in a lumber factory (pictured)

Despite losing so much, Hu said she wasn't angry or bitter, only grateful she survived the accident. 'I never feel the life is unfair to me,' she said.

Refusing to let it hold her back, she added she had never dreamed of begging. Instead the incredible mother took every job she could- from plowing the fields to even working down a mine between 2006 and 2010- all while walking on her knees.

'I have no feet, but I have hands and I have strength. I can support myself,' said the 50-year-old. 

Her incredible spirit and determination has seen her nicknamed 'Sister Strong-Will' in her hometown of Jiangdi, in southern China's Guangxi Province

Incredibly, for around four years, between 2006-2010, Hu had even worked in a mine before her current job in a lumber yard (pictured)

'I did every job to support the family and my little daughter. I crawled in the field in plowing it.

'I worked in the quarry, and I learnt to make embroideries. I felt guilty as I can't give her a better life.

'My principles are simple, sharing, friendly, and working hard. I don't care much about the amount of salaries, as long as I work with a happy team and company.'

From last October, with the help of local disabled people association, she has now found a job in a local lumber factory.

Working in the lumber yard: Hu has done a wide variety of jobs to support the family and her little daughter

She says she has also crawled in the field to plow it, worked in a quarry and learnt to make embroideries

Before going out, Hu wraps her knees with cloth before adding a pair of rubber 'shoes' made out of old bus tires

She married in 1980, and two years later her daughter was born but when her baby was only four months old, her husband abandoned them

Hu was left to support the whole family on her own despite her disability- her daughter has since married and moved away

The inspiring figure was once offered the chance of a pair of prosthetic legs but found them too uncomfortable

She said that after wearing prosthetics, her legs would swell and become very painful to walk on

Out shopping: Hu refuses to let her disability hold her back and will walk on her knees down to the shops or to work

'Sister Strong-Will' says she doesn't feel angry about the accident that robbed her of her feet, but she said she was simply grateful that she survived
