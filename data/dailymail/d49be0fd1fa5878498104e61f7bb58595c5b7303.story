Floatation: Twitter is expected to be valued at £7 billion despite never making a profit

Twitter is expected to be valued at £7billion when its shares are offered on Wall Street before the end of the year.

Launched in 2006, it has gone from a simple messaging site to a forum where everybody from world leaders to celebrities can write to hundreds of thousands of followers at once.

More than 500 million tweets are posted every day, but documents sent to the US market regulator ahead of the flotation reveal that it has never made a profit.

Revenues tripled to almost £200million last year but it still lost £50million. Twitter said it expected to go into the black by the end of next year.

A £7 billion listing would make it  bigger in value than companies such as Morrisons and EasyJet.

In excess of 300 billion tweets have been sent since the service, which allows users to publish notes of 140 characters or fewer instantly, launched.

More than 250 million people use the site every month - with 100 million posting something every day.

But it has also attracted internet trolls spewing hatred and bile.

Earlier this year two female British MPs received rape and death threats from anonymous users on the site.

More than 64,000 people signed a petition in the wake of the incident calling for a ‘zero tolerance’ policy on abuse by the site’s owners, who stand to make millions from the float.

Now it is preparing to offer shares on Wall Street from as early as November.

Despite being free to use, the company is able to rake in millions of pounds selling advertising.

Last year its revenues tripled to almost £200million. But despite the increase it still made a loss of £50million.

In the documents the company said it expected to go into the black by the end of next year.

If it was based in the UK, rather than in California’s Silicon Valley, the company would be one of the country’s largest.
