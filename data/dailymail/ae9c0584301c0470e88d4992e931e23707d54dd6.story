Sometimes love is just matter of timing - just ask this New Zealand couple.

Mark Trenberth realised his dream to become engaged to his girlfriend during a reverse bungy ride in Auckland on Saturday but there was just one problem - she beat him to the punch.

Unaware that her boyfriend was preparing to propose when the ride was over, Katrina Genefaas popped the question herself while the bungy was in motion.

Love is in the air, as pair separately propose to each other on reverse bungy.

Ms Genefaas could not believe that her boyfriend Mark Trenberth had the same thought of proposing on a thrill ride.

Looking slightly nervous Ms Genefaas turns to her boyfriend and says, 'Babe, you know I love you, and you know I'd do anything with you ... Will you marry me?'

The look of shock is clear on the New Zealand man's face who cheekily replies 'No' as he giggles and pulls out his own engagement ring.

And not to be trumped - he proposes back.

'She took it out of my mouth, really,' Mr Trenberth told The New Zealand Herald.

'I said 'no' at the start because I was shocked. I wasn't expecting it.'

'I was really, really, really scared about doing the bungy and what we said to each other was pretty lame,' Ms Genefaas said.

The New Zealand couple were engaged on August 16 on on a reverse bungy in Auckland, New Zealand.

The 27-year-old service manager of City Autos Limited had planned his proposal for earlier when the couple were snowboarding.

'I was going to go ahead and go down on my knees and get her to stop in front of me. But she couldn't learn to stop, so I missed out on that one,' he said.

Ms Genefaas parents had received phone calls about each person's proposal plans and managed to keep their lips sealed.

'They did really well,' the bride-to-be said of her parents, who were babysitting the newly engaged couples son while the pair got engaged.

Their hearts were soaring and so were their bodies after their unique proposal.

'Well that's one way to get engaged!' Ms Genefaas exclaims after the ride.
