Speed king: Sebastian Vettel triumphed for Red Bull at the fast-paced Monza circuit in last season's race

Clash of the titans: Monza will see the battle for the drivers' title resume between Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg following their highly controversial collision in Spa last time out

Picking up the pieces: Daniel Ricciardo took advantage of the Mercedes pair clashing to win in Belgium

* Daniel Ricciardo now has back-to-back wins to his credit, becoming the first Australian since Mark Webber in 2010 to achieve the feat.

* Just three drivers have won races this season - Lewis Hamilton (5), Nico Rosberg (4) and Ricciardo (3).

* Mercedes have scored 11 pole positions to date. Just five teams have managed more in one season - Red Bull, McLaren, Williams, Lotus and Ferrari. Red Bull hold the record with 18 in 2011.

* The Italian Grand Prix has been won from pole 11 times in the last 14 years, making it more important than Monaco, which has only been won from pole nine times in the same period.

* Monza is the fastest circuit of the year with an average lap speed of around 150mph. The season average is 131mph.

Scenic: Monza's podium which stretches over the start/finish straight is a drivers' favourite on the calendar

Setting records: Michael Schumacher has the most Italian Grand Prix wins with five, his last in 2006 was his penultimate victory for Ferrari

Winners: Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso are the only three previous winners of the Italian Grand Prix on the current F1 grid - only the Brit has triumphed in a race this season

* The Italian Grand Prix is one of only two ever-present races on the Formula One world championship calendar, the other being the British.

* This is the 65th running of the Italian Grand Prix as part of the F1 world championship, with 63 of the previous 64 held at Monza, the exception being 1980 when the race was held at Imola and won by Nelson Piquet.

* Piquet also has three Italian Grand Prix victories at Monza, placing him second on the all-time list behind Michael Schumacher with five, all for Ferrari.

* Ferrari holds the record as the winning constructor, having taken victory 18 times.

* Fernando Alonso, with two wins in 2007 and 2010, Lewis Hamilton (2012) and Sebastian Vettel (2008, 2011, 2013) are the only Italian GP winners on the current grid.
