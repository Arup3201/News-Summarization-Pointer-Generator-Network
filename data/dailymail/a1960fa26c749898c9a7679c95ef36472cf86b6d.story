The 16-year-old boy accused of brutally murdering his mother because she grounded him and took away his cell phone is being charged as an adult in the case.

At 6 feet, 6 inches tall and 265 pounds, Michael Roy Helms, from Phoenix, Arizona, would have towered over his mother Tina Helms Spencer, 36. She was found murdered in the backyard shed of their Mesa home on Saturday morning.

Helms' friend Christian Lee Blakely, 17, was also charged in the murder and is accused of witnessing the woman's slaying and helping his friend conceal the body.

Court records say that he 'stood in the dark and watched as the murder occurred'.

Detectives believe the teenagers waited at the home for Tina Spencer to return.

'As the victim entered her residence, the defendant then intentionally 
struck her with a frying pan, struck her with a hammer, and choked her 
in a rage,' according to court records.

A frying pan and a hammer were found at the scene.

Later, Helms' stepfather was attacked by the boy when he arrived home early on Saturday morning but manged to escape and ran to a neighbor's house to call police.

Sgt Tony Landato, a Mesa police spokesman, told AZCentral: 'He’s getting choked, he’s being hit. At some point, he’s able to get free.'

Throughout the ordeal, Mr Spencer believed his wife was asleep. But when police arrived they followed a trail of blood and found Helms in the shed with his mother's body.

Blakely is said to have confessed to detectives that he watched the slaying, walked with Helms while he carried his mother's body to the shed and helped him mop up the blood.

Mike Helms is facing first degree murder charges after the body of his mom, Tina Helms Spencer, 36, was found at the family's home in Mesa, Arizona, on Saturday

Helms has been booked into juvenile detention on charges including first-degree murder, aggravated assault and tampering with evidence

The documents said that Helms confirmed many details but added that Blakely helped him drag Helms Spencer’s body to the shed.

Joan
and Phil Knowles, who moved to the neighborhood almost two years ago 
said they knew something was up on Friday when they spoke to Helms.

'He said the house is now 
mine — three times,' Phil Knowles told AZCentral. 'I really thought of 
him as being aloof, not aggressive,' Phil said.

Joan said Helms 'told us his folks moved to Ohio to be closer to 
family'. 

They also said he bragged in the past about owning a boa constrictor which he fed a chicken to every week.

Michael
Helms was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder, attempted 
first-degree murder, three counts of aggravated assault with a dangerous
instrument, concealment of a dead body and tampering with evidence, 
according to the court document.

Blakely was arrested on suspicion of first-degree homicide accomplice, concealing a dead body and tampering with evidence.

School friend Mike O'Connor described Helms as a 'giant teddy' and a friendly kid who sometimes fought with his parents

A school friend of Helms described him as a friendly kid, a junior ROTC cadet in high school.

'He's a giant teddy. He's tough on the outside. He puts up that front, but when you get to know him, he's a standup guy,' Mike O'Connor told FOX10.

'He didn't really have home issues he talked about. If he did, it was typical stuff. One week he'd have a fight with this parents, the next week he was talking about how his mom was awesome and helping him out with something.'
