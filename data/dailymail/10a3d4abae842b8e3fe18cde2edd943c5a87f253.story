A study has found that the same amount of wealthy families shopped at budget chains like Aldi in the last three months as lower income families

Class and snobbery are no longer a barrier for middle-class families when it comes to shopping at budget stores.

A study shows 45 per cent of wealthy households have stopped at Aldi or Lidl in the past three months – exactly the same percentage as for lower income families.

While the budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, they have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings. 

Just this week, Aldi has unveiled some new additions to its ‘Specially Selected’ range including Ultimate Sirloin Steak, Scottish Lightly Smoked Salmon Fillets, gourmet Gorgonzola cheese and Chorizo.

The survey of shopping habits was conducted by experts at the Wilson Drinks Report, which analyses where the nation is buying its wine.

Managing director of the organisation, Tim Wilson, said: ‘In the past we might have expected a much higher proportion of C2DE shoppers to buy food and alcohol at the big discounters. However our new research confirms that the upper and middle classes are just as happy to grab a bargain.

‘Initiatives like the recent launch of premium French wine in Lidl, endorsed by a Master of Wine, only adds to the increasing credibility of the discounters in the minds of the shopper.’

He added: ‘We think that this provides real evidence that any perceived embarrassment of more middle and upper class shoppers being seen shopping at the discounters has now gone.’

Aldi said its ‘Specially Selected’ range of products are chosen based on a measure of outstanding quality, ingredients, provenance and recipe.

Its Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying, Tony Baines, said: ‘The launch of these new lines shows you can now buy your basic weekly shop at Aldi, but also premium food items, to really add a little bit of luxury to your everyday meals.

‘This is particularly important at this time of the year when people are trying to beat the January blues. Shopping at Aldi enables customers to save money, while treating themselves to something extra special.

‘In the past three months, we have expanded our entire core range by 11per cent to match the wants and needs of our customers. We will continue to work towards delighting our customers with our range, and offering the best quality and price in the supermarket sector.’

The new larger range of products also includes Halloumi cheese, Long Sliced Smoked Salmon and Sweetened Soya Milk.
