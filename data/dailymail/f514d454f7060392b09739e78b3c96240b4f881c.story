A British soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for thrusting a piece of paper at a Taliban fighter, it has emerged.

He was accused of abuse for touching the terror suspect on the nose with the sheet during a routine interrogation in Afghanistan.

The enemy fighter had been captured and detained as a potential ringleader in the murder and mutilation of four French soldiers in 2008.

But it was the military intelligence officer, who had an exemplary record, who was investigated for possible war crimes amid claims he had broken rules banning the touching of prisoners during interrogation.

On another occasion an interrogator was probed for shouting in a suspect’s ear in case he burst an ear drum, it was claimed. 

The investigation is said to have taken place four years after the alleged offence.

The incidents came to light after the Ministry of Defence tightened the rules governing tactical questioning in the wake of several highly-damaging allegations that UK troops abused captives in their custody.

The changes have led to considerable disquiet in the military that soldiers are being hampered in their ability to extract information from insurgents that could potentially save lives.

Last week, the Al Sweady Inquiry report into the fallout from a firefight in Iraq in 2004 which became known as the Battle of Danny Boy concluded that insurgents and their families had used ‘deliberate lies’ to smear British troops.

Sir Thayne Forbes, who led the £31million inquiry, found that claims soldiers murdered, mutilated and tortured detainees were ‘wholly and entirely without merit’.

But while blasting the Iraqis and their legal aid-funded British lawyers, the 1,250-page report also turned the spotlight on nine examples of military intelligence officers abusing Iraqi detainees during questioning, although these instances were found to be ‘relatively minor’.

Colonel Tim Collins, who was awarded an OBE for his service during the Iraq war, said he blamed 'ambulance chasing lawyers' for the new rules on interrogation 

One soldier was criticised for walking around a captured and blindfolded Iraqi insurgent and blowing gently on his neck, which Sir Thayne said ‘amounted to a form of ill-treatment’.

The soldier was also castigated for banging a metal tent peg on a table to startle the prisoner, shouting in the man’s ear and warning him he would never see his wife if he refused to co-operate.

Following the revelations, a former senior Army interrogator, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘There was an incident in 2008 when French soldiers were massacred and the bodies of four of them were mutilated.

‘We had two of the suspects in detention and they were brought in for questioning.

‘One of the interrogators touched one of the suspects on the nose with an A4 piece of paper and he was investigated by the special investigation branch for abuse.

‘Just for touching a detainee on the nose. The fact somebody could be investigated for that is to my mind incredible. It was ridiculous. These French soldiers had been horribly mutilated and yet it was the interrogator who was investigated.’

Blaming MoD lawyers, the former soldier said: ‘We once had in for questioning a well-known Taliban fighter.

‘He didn’t say a word; he wouldn’t speak to us and when he eventually did all he would say through the translator was: “Your detention policy is toothless”.

‘We would have these suspects in and there we are worried about what the lawyers in Britain are going to say. These are really bad people. They mutilate their victims.

‘They murder women and children and all we can think about is did we shout in their ear and will we get investigated for that? That’s how ridiculous it got.’

Colonel Tim Collins, who made a celebrated eve-of-battle speech during the Iraq war, said he blamed ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ and ‘play-it-safe judges’ for the new rules on interrogation.

He said: ‘We are no longer able to carry out tactical questioning. That in itself brings risks to the lives of the people we deploy.

‘These insurgents are not nice people. These are criminals. They behead people; they keep sex slaves. They are not normal people.’
