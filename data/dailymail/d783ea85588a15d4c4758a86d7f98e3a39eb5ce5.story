A baby-faced gang of thugs are today facing life behind bars after stabbing a defenceless teenager to death with a 2ft sword.

In a terrifying example of the knife crime blighting Britain, the five – two of them aged just 13 – were part of a gang who chased Sean McHugh, 19, into a launderette and killed him.

As he lay dying in hospital, the yobs sent each other a series of chilling messages mocking their victim.

Liverpool Crown Court heard gang member Keyfer Dykstra, 14, posted on Facebook: ‘RIP Shorty – we always knew ye was a pussy’. Eleven people ‘liked’ the comment.

Cousins: Corey Hewitt, 14, (left) and his cousin Andrew Hewitt, 15, (right) were also found guilty of the 'vicious and brutal' murder after the two month trial

Fourteen-year-olds Keyfer  Dykstra, Joseph McGill and Corey Hewitt, plus his 15-year-old cousin Andrew Hewitt were all convicted of the 'vicious and brutal' attack in Anfield, Liverpool, along with 19-year-old Reese O’Shaughnessy.

Recorder
 of Liverpool, Clement Goldstone QC, took the unusual step of naming the
 young gang members after a jury found them guilty.

The boys were also slammed by a detective in the case, who said they had shown little remorse for 
their actions, including the suffering heaped upon Mr McHugh and his family.

The senior police officer also said he heard the boys laughing and joking as they sat in the dock. 

Victim Mr McHugh had been walking down the street with friend Josh Williams were walking back from a launderette in Anfield when they were approached by some of the gang.

Victim: Sean McHugh, 19, was chased down the street and into a launderette by the gang members, before he was attacked with the weapon and stabbed in the leg, slashing open a major artery

As
 Mr Williams sought refuge inside a nearby newsagent, Mr McHugh, who was
 known as Shorty, was chased back into the launderette.

O’Shaughnessy,
 who was carrying a sword stick - a walking cane with a blade hidden 
inside - and Dykstra, armed with a knife arrived a short time later and 
the gang kicked the back door of the shop open.

During the trial, Liverpool
 Crown Court heard O’Shaughnessy stabbed Mr McHugh in the leg before the
 wounded teenager managed to escaped into the back garden of a nearby 
home.

Ringleader: Liverpool Crown Court heard that Reese O'Shaughnessy, 19, had been carrying the sword stick

However, prosecutors
 were unable to prove just who struck the fatal blow but argued that all
 involved in the attack were guilty of murder whether they held the 
blade of not.

A policeman found Mr McHugh bleeding heavily
 from the gaping wound and although the teen was rushed to hospital he 
died four days after the attack on September 30 last year.

Nicholas 
Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the court that the boys referred to 
themselves as the ‘Laneheads’, after the gang’s territory around the 
Townsend Lane area of Anfield.

Rivals Mr McHugh and Mr Williams, were called ‘Village Rats’, because they came from the Walton Village area of Liverpool.

As the younger boys were under 18, orders banning their identities from being released had been put in place by the court, a practice common in cases involving children.

Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, described the crime as 'difficult and sensitive' and said the trial had been 'particularly traumatic'.

Due to the serious nature of their crimes, Judge Goldstone decided that he would lift the anonymity orders.

He said: 'I am quite satisfied the criteria for the naming of the 
defendants is made out.

'It is in the public interest they be named.'

A sixth boy, who always protested that he was not at the scene of the 
murder, was found not guilty and released from the dock with his 
identity protected.

Speaking
 after the conclusion of the trial, Detective Chief Inspector Andy 
O’Connor from Merseyside Police said: 'Since the attack, none of the 
five have shown any remorse for what they did to Sean. 

'They even laughed and joked in the dock at court. 

'They have shown no thought, or 
consideration, for Sean’s family and girlfriend, who are now left to 
grieve and to piece their lives together without him. 

'The suffering Sean endured before his death and the pain and heartbreak inflicted on his family can never be taken back.'

Weapon: The sword stick used by the gang to attack Mr McHugh. The teenager was stabbed in the leg, severing a major artery

Terror: Mr McHugh was chased into the Liver Launderette by the gang, who kicked the door to the back of the shop open and stabbed him in the leg

Escape: Mr McHugh managed to escape the gang but was found bleeding heavily in a nearby back garden. He was taken to hospital but later died

Rachael Barber, from the Crown Prosecution Service, added: 'Most of the gang were just children at the time.

'But were willing to use deadly weapons and acted together to attack Mr McHugh, which ultimately resulted in his death.'

Reports on the boys’ maturity, psychology and dangerousness will be compiled before sentencing on July 2.

Territory: Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that the boys referred to themselves as the 'Laneheads', after the gang's territory around the Townsend Lane area of Anfield
