He's always liked younger ladies (think Penelope Cruz, 40, and Katie Holmes, 35), but this new one appears to be fresh out of college.

On Friday UsWeekly reported Tom Cruise, 52, has a 'crush' on Emily, his 22-year-old assistant who's helping him while he shoots Mission: Impossible 5 around the world.

In late September the actor was spotted with a mystery woman who appears to be the lady in question. They were side-by-side as he took a break from filming in London.

A new romance?: Tom Cruise  is 'crushing' on a 22-year-old Mission: Impossible 5 female crew member, according to a Friday report from UsWeekly; in September the 52-year-old actor was spotted with this lovely woman on the London set of the sequel

She looks like a college student: The woman that Cruise was seen with in England wore a grey sweatshirt and a braided bracelet; interestingly, Tom had one on too

'He's always flirting with her,' a source revealed. 'Most people on the film have noticed how into her he is.'

Ever the professional, the father of three is waiting until his work on the big-budget action movie is over till he takes the lady out.

'He's already asked Emily to go out to dinner with him, on a date, when they're done shooting,' the source said.

Mr On The Go: Cruise looked like he had his hands full with two cell phones and headphones on as the young lady greeted him; she too was wired up with a Walkie Talkie at the ready

Hot catch: The A lister has been single since divorcing Katie Holmes in 2012; together they have daughter Suri, aged eight

And the Oscar nominee is very excited about when that day comes. The insider has 'never seen him crush on anyone so hard.' 

Tom has two children with Nicole Kidman who are around the same age as the assistant: 19-year-old Connor (who is working as a DJ in nightclubs) and 21-year-old Isabella.

The woman pictured with Cruise in September seems to be just his type: attractive with long hair and thick eyebrows.

Not an easy film to make: The Oscar nominee has been doing many of his own stunts on the fifth installment of Mission: Impossible; here he was shooting a scene on an airplane on Monday in England

She could even pass for a relative of Holmes', who Cruise was married to from 2006 to 2012 and had daughter Suri, aged eight, with.

Tom has not dated anyone since he split from Katie in the summer of 2012.

But it was only last week that the Top Gun star was linked to both Miranda Kerr and Lindsay Lohan in separate reports.

Both beauties denied they had romantic relations with the thrice-married A-lister (his first marriage was to 58-year-old actress Mimi Rogers).

Another beauty on set: The Minority Report hit maker is also working with newcomer Stella Stocker on Mission: Impossible 5, which is due out in December 2015

A flat-out hit: Tom in 1996 in the first Mission: Impossible movie, which has spawned three sequels

This new report comes from a source who is working on the set of the action film. Tom has been shooting M:I5 in England, Austria and Morocco.

Mission: Impossible 5 is an action-spy film directed by Christopher McQuarrie, and written by Drew Pearce and Will Staples.

It is the fifth film in the highly successful Mission: Impossible series. 

Will he marry for a fourth time?: The Edge Of Tomorrow superstar, seen here in May, is worth a fortune and still has a lot of power in Hollywood so the ladies must be flocking

Along with Tom as agent Ethan Hunt, Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton are also returning. 

Alec Baldwin is a fresh face in the cast. Newcomer Stella Stocker (who had a small part in Brad Pitt's Fury), also has a role. Interestingly, she resembles Katie as well.

Filming began on M;I5 in August, 2014 and is scheduled to be released in North America by Paramount Pictures on December 25, 2015.

They lasted six years: Cruise with Katie Holmes at the Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol premiere in NYC in December 2011
