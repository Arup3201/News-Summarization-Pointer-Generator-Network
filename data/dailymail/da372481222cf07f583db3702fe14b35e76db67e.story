A mystery corpse found at the bottom of a well was seriously assaulted before being put down there, police have revealed.

Officers are still trying to identify the victim – who was discovered on Friday 
by two gardeners clearing the grounds of a detached house in Surrey.

They
 found the body, which was partially clothed, at the bottom of an 
11ft-deep well covered with wire mesh and a concrete slab.

The male victim could have been killed up to a fortnight ago, according to murder detectives.

Results of an initial post-mortem examination did not prove conclusive in providing a cause of death and further tests will be carried out, Scotland Yard said.

However, the examination did reveal injuries to the body consistent with an assault, said a police spokesman.

One of the padlocks securing the wire mesh had been cut, allowing the culprit to drop the corpse down the well.

Rory Mulholland, 21, who was working with 17-year-old Jack Duncan said: ‘There was quite a lot of trash in the garden.

‘I assumed whoever owned the house was clearing the house out and getting it renovated and it was the end of their tenancy.’

He
 added: ‘We spotted a big blue tarpaulin at the bottom of the well and 
we were curious to see what it was.

'Jack turned the tarpaulin over with a
 length of kitchen drainpipe and then we noticed the outline of a 
person.

'You could see the shape of someone’s legs and a bottom.

‘Then
 we flipped the tarp over again and I saw someone’s upper thigh.

'It was 
definitely a man. I’ve never smelt anything like it.’

The
 decomposing corpse was found in the overgrown garden of a property in 
Warlingham, Surrey, which is currently the home of a group of Polish car
 wash workers.

All 
seven men – who are aged between 21 and 27 – were arrested on suspicion 
of murder over the weekend, but have now been questioned and released on
 bail.

One said: ‘I want to 
clear my name. There has been a big mistake.

'We don’t know nothing. We 
just live there. The police said nothing to us.’

And
 George Anastasi, who is the owner of both the property and the car 
wash, said he was ‘completely shocked’ when he heard of the discovery.

Asked
 if anyone who lived or worked there could be responsible, he replied: 
‘I would find it very hard to believe it’s one of them.’

The
 men have now all returned to work at the nearby car wash.

But they are 
staying at a hotel so police can search the property – which neighbours 
say could fetch up to £1million if sold to a developer.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, who is leading the inquiry, said a 
post-mortem examination was underway to try and identify a cause and 
time of death.

Specialist divers, pictured, were called to the scene and were assessing how to remove the body without destroying any evidence

Evidence found by the divers at the scene indicated that the body had been placed in the well, police said

And he stressed that officers are working around the clock to identify the victim, adding: ‘This is an unusual case.

‘I
 would appeal for anybody who has concerns about a missing person or who
 believes they may know something about this individual or incident to 
call my officers.

‘Although I
 cannot elaborate further at this time, I have  reason to believe that 
this body was placed into the well and we are treating the incident  as a
 murder.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
