The unmanned
Dragon capsule from the private US firm SpaceX successfully reached the
International Space Station today, its third trip carrying supplies and equipment
to the orbiting lab.

NASA broadcast
live images of the ISS's 17.6m (57.7ft) long robotic arm as it grabbed hold of
the gumdrop-shaped capsule on schedule.

'Capture
complete, congratulations to the entire team,' said the Japanese station
commander, Koichi Wakata, who was in charge of operating the mechanical arm
along with American Rick Mastracchio.

'We're excited,'
Wakata said, smiling.

Both astronauts
were dressed casually in polo shirts as they carried out the procedure.

NASA said the
event took place 250miles (402km) above the Earth's surface as the ISS hovered
over the Nile.

SpaceX has a
$1.6bn contract with NASA for a series of future supply missions.Â

This marks the
California-based company's third commercial resupply mission and fourth visit
to the ISS.

After three
delays, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off with the Dragon capsule from Cape
Canaveral in Florida on Friday.

The mission had
originally been scheduled for mid-March but did not go ahead because of
technical issues.

The Dragon
capsule delivered 2.2 tons of cargo, including food, new spacesuits,
components to replace those aboard the ISS and equipment for 150 scientific
experiments.

One of the
experiments will be the Vegetable Production System, or Veggie, which would
allow the production of salad-type crops to safely feed the astronauts.

Another
experiment seeks to determine why an astronaut's immune system weakens in
microgravity.

NASA is also
sending an experiment system that can more rapidly transmit data using a laser
communication system, in a first from space.

In all, SpaceX
is due to complete a dozen missions for the US space agency.

SpaceX became
the first commercial entity to reach the space station with its Dragon cargo
ship in May 2012 in a trial run. Owned by internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, the
company's first cargo mission took place in October that year.

The last mission
involving a Dragon capsule was completed in March 2013.
