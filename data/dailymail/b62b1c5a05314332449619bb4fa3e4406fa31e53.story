Thriving: Britain's soggy summer has provided perfect breeding conditions for pesky mosquitoes

Beware this Bank Holiday weekend. If the rain doesn’t get you, a mosquito might.

Sun-starved Britons who had their hopes of a glorious summer dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the bizarre weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations.

The
current wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground
for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported
bites.

There are even fears of a new 'superflea' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem.

In the past week alone Tesco has seen sales of the creams shoot up by 150 per cent at its pharmacies across the UK, while the number of people calling NHS Direct for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years.

'The recent balmy weather has led to the most concentrated demand for insect bite and sting creams we have ever seen,' said Tesco spokeswoman Joy Wickham.

'Demand has been rising through the summer and during the very muggy weather we had last weekend we saw the highest sales so far this year.'

The insects won’t be the only  hazard, however.

As around 1.8million Britons prepare to head abroad for the break, the Met Office is warning of heavy downpours across the country. Some areas could see as much as two inches of rain today.

Forecasters issued a 24-hour severe weather alert, predicting torrential storms and gusts of winds of up to 50mph along the south coast.

Things could start looking up tomorrow, however. Most of the country is expected to see a drier day with the exception of northern England where there could be some lingering showers.

Temperatures are not expected to reach much higher than 20C (68F) over the weekend.

Gareth Harvey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘It won’t be the best of Bank Holiday weekends. There’s an Atlantic depression heading in towards the UK, bringing spells of quite heavy rain.’

He added: ‘Monday may start off sunny in some areas, particularly in the East, which will hold on to it for a good part of the day.’

NHS Direct confirmed that this summer has seen the highest number of calls about insect bites and stings for three years.

People coping with the humid weather by sleeping with their windows open and spending more time outside are finding themselves plagued by parasites.

As people prepare to descend on parks and beer gardens over the bank holiday weekend chemists are ordering in extra supplies of bite remedies to combat the impact of increased numbers of insects eager to sink their 'teeth' into unwitting humans.

Entomologist Steven Falk, from the conservation charity Buglife, said the mosquito population had dramatically increased on account of the wet spring and summer - which has created perfect breeding conditions for the pesky flies.

'The wet and humid weather has resulted in an increased breeding habitat for mosquitoes, such as pools and water-filled ditches, which has led to more people being bitten than during a normal year,' he said.

And its not just insect remedies for humans that are flying off the shelves - there has also been a 'dramatic' increase in demand for flea treatments for household pets.

The UK's flea population has also been thriving in the damp weather conditions, and sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year, according to BBC Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours.

Lucy Chadwick, head vet for retailer Pet Drugs Online, said: 'The [sales] numbers do fluctuate a bit from time to time but this is quite dramatic.'

Dr Tim Nuttall, veterinary dermatologist at the University of Liverpool, said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two.

He explained that the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea, which - despite its title - will live off dogs, ferrets and humans as well as felines.

The boom is bad news for those of us susceptible to bites, as experts say that even when fleas appear to be beaten, they can make an unexpected return.

Richard Mosely, of the British Pest Control Association, said: 'They have an ability to go into a sort of suspended animation.

'Even if you go into a flat which has been unoccupied for a year, their cocoons can be set off again by the carbon dioxide in people's breath.'

Midges and other insects are also on the rise thanks to the washout summer, and NHS Direct has reported an overall rise in the number of calls about all varieties of stings and bites since early May.

Calls to the service have doubled since the beginning of July, with the number of queries continuing to rise throughout the month of August.

In the period since May, NHS Direct has dealt with 8,953 calls about bites and stings, compared to 8,641 this time last year, and 7,450 for the same period in 2010.

Despite recent warm temperatures, the summer of 2012 is likely to be remembered as one marred by persistent bouts of heavy rain.

The pattern is set to continue with forecasters predicting a wet and windy bank holiday this weekend.

Intermittent sunny spells are expected to be accompanied by stormy weather conditions that will sweep across the country - threatening to turn the bank holiday weekend into yet another washout.
