Bayern Munich have announced the signing of Spain Under 21 international Juan Bernat from Valencia on a five-year deal.

Bayern did not disclose the fee for the 21-year-old full-back, who can also operate as a winger, but media reports quoted a figure of €10million (£7.9m).

'Bernat is an extraordinary young player who we've been watching for a long time,' said sporting director Matthias Sammer.
