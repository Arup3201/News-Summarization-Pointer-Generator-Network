There is a group of hunters who spend every night shooting springbok in South Africa.

The men hunt the animals in the Southern Free-State near Johannesburg in the dark from March to October each year.

The national animal, which can reach speeds of over 60 miles per hour, are hunted for their skins and meat in an African industry which is booming.

One of the most hunted species in South Africa and Namibia, the beautiful animals are one of the few antelope species that are thought to be increasing in numbers.

The springbok are also hunted for sport and in 2010 more than 3,000 were killed legally by hobby hunters.

Trophy hunting is big business in South Africa where it is classed as eco-tourism and brings in an estimated £64 million to the country's economy.

Rich westerners pay large sums to shoot large wild animals including lions and other big game. But campaigners say it is not only immoral but has had a devastating effect on wildlife.

Lion populations have halved in the last 30 years and much of the blame has been pointed at trophy hunters.

The Free State is made up of rolling open plains and mountainous terrain. Here hunting springbok is legal. 

In prehistoric times, springbok were hunted using stone tools and they continue to be hunted in South Africa as well as Namibia and Botswana.

The area was named after early European explorers moved to the Cape Colony from 1828 onwards to abolish slavery. The pioneers set up a ‘free state,’ away from British rule and influence.
