Paul Scholes has claimed that Manchester City's 3-1 rout over Liverpool on Monday night is proof that they can win the Champions League.

Scholes tipped City to compete with the very best in Europe this season, and labelled Monday's victory as confirmation of City's intent.

'Watching Manchester City on Monday night, the scale of the club’s ambitions was clear for anyone to see. They do not just want to be champions of England; this is a squad built to win the Champions League, too,' Scholes told The Independent in his weekly column.

Scholes, a United man by his own admission, admits City look good enough to win the Champions League

City's 3-1 victory over last season's runners-up Liverpool ensured a maximum six points for the champions, and leaves them well-placed going into a tough September, where they face a difficult trip to Arsenal, before hosting Jose Mourinho's Chelsea at the Etihad. 

On Monday, a brace from Stevan Jovetic, followed by a killer blow from Sergio Aguero just 23 seconds after entering the field as a substitute, was enough to secure the win, and Scholes believes that their strength in depth is perhaps their strongest quality.

'The most daunting aspect of it all was when Jovetic scored his second and the camera panned over to the bench.'

'The substitutes in shot were Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and Jesus Navas – it reminded me what an incredible squad Manuel Pellegrini has at his disposal. There are 22 proper, top-class footballers at that club, and they can compete with the very best in Europe.'

Scholes, who by his own admission is United through and through, also cites City's diversity in player style as a title-winning combination. Yaya Toure and David Silva are very different players - little and large, by all accounts - but the way Pellegrini has the team working as a unit will surely run them close to the Premier League title again.

'City were sensational at times against Liverpool. All good sides have a mixture of qualities and City have the guile of Samir Nasri and David Silva combined with the pace and power of Yaya Touré. Alongside Touré is Fernando, a variation on Fernandinho, whom I also like.'
