It was all smiles and festive cheer when David Cameron dropped in on British troops for a coffee and a chat during a surprise Christmas trip to Afghanistan yesterday.

But back home, anger was mounting against the Government for capping military pay rises at 1 per cent a year from 2013 – a real-terms cut.

Mr Cameron was forced to admit that the Coalition had ‘more to do’ to uphold the Military Covenant as top brass and military charities lined up to blast him over a plan which has hit morale at a time when the Army, Royal Navy and RAF are already facing crippling cuts.

David Cameron had been due to go to Camp Bastion but a sand storm meant he had to land at Kandahar instead

The pay squeeze for the military came
despite the Government hiking benefits, including unemployment payments
and disability living allowance, by a record 5.2 per cent.

The Prime Minister said: ‘There is 
always more to be done. We have gone a long way to get it [the covenant]
into law, giving it real teeth [but] we have got further to go.’

The row simmered as the Government 
published a report on how it was strengthening the covenant. The 
116-page document highlighted ‘concerns’ among the rank-and-file over 
pay and perks, healthcare and education.

The Royal British Legion also flagged
up continuing worries about long-term care for wounded servicemen and 
women, support for reservists and the handling of veterans’ complaints.

Wearing a fleece, khaki trousers and 
military-style boots, Mr Cameron had been due to make a morale-boosting 
trip to Camp Bastion in Helmand province, where most British forces are 
based.

But his RAF flight 
was forced to divert because a dust storm caused the Camp Bastion runway
to be shut for the first time this year.

Instead, the C-17 Globemaster had to 
land at Kandahar airfield, where only a small proportion of the 9,500 UK
troops deployed in Afghanistan are based.

Commenting on the dust storm that prevented his visit to Helmand, Mr Cameron said: 'It's slightly changed our plan' adding 'there's no point whingeing about it'

At Kandahar, Mr Cameron took the opportunity to meet members of RAF 12(B) Squadron - from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland - who fly the Tornado fighter jet on missions all over Afghanistan.

In a reference to the weather - the first day of poor visibility after weeks of clear skies - the Prime Minister joked: 'It’s slightly changed our plan.'

Wearing a black Berghaus fleece, khaki chinos and boots, Mr Cameron was shown around a Tornado.

He also met US General James Huggins, the head of Isaf Regional Command South, for talks on military progress in Afghanistan.

And he had a chat over a mug of tea with soldiers and air personnel in the Naafi canteen.

But
plans to take a helicopter to Lashkar Gah to meet the governor of 
Helmand and visit a frontline base in the province had to be abandoned.

Speaking
to journalists on the trip, Mr Cameron admitted it was 'disappointing' 
but said British troops in Afghanistan faced the same issues every day.

'You just have to take it as it comes in this job,' he said.

'What we have experienced today is what people working out here experience the whole time.'

He said there was 'no point whingeing about it' and he had been able to meet service personnel he would not usually see.

'You
just have to take the rough with the smooth; I don’t feel particularly 
jinxed,' he added in response to the suggestion that he faced regular 
difficulties on foreign trips.

The Prime Minister defended imposing a one per cent pay rise cap for troops from 2013, insisting the money was better spent on increasing the operational allowance for those on active duty overseas.

He said: 'I think we are doing the right thing - and remember, we have doubled the operational allowance so that people serving out here in Afghanistan get that extra £5,000.

'Using the money that way, rather than having a blanket pay increase where a lot of the extra money would go to pay generals and colonels and the rest of it, is I think the right thing to do.'

The report records improvements to operational allowances, leave arrangements, mental healthcare provision and support for forces children's education over the past year.

But Shadow Health Secretary Jim Murphy said: 'Our forces will judge ministers on actions, not warm words.'

The Prime Minister indicated that he was planning further withdrawals of troops in 2013 after the 500 due to be pulled out next year.

He again refused to give an exact timescale for how Britain’s deployment would be withdrawn ahead of his deadline for all combat troops to be out by the end of 2014.

But he told reporters: 'I don’t want to see some massive cliff-edge in 2014 - I don’t think that’s practical.

'But I don’t think we need to make hard and fast decisions at this stage.'

He said there was 'an ongoing conversation with our allies' about how and when Nato forces would be withdrawn over the next three years.

'I’m absolutely clear that the British public deserve to know there is an endpoint to our involvement in Afghanistan and that endpoint is 2014,' he said.
