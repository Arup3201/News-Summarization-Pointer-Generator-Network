A record number of middle class shoppers flocked through the doors of Poundland over Christmas in a bid to cut rising household bills.

The chain said well-to-do customers now account for more than a fifth of all people who walk through its doors, as it fills its shelves with more upmarket products.

It now stocks Jane Asher baking equipment, Duchy Originals tea, nail varnish, and National Trust bird seed.

Bargain hunt: A record number of middle class shoppers flocked through the doors of Poundland over Christmas in a bid to cut rising household bills

It is the latest discounter to see a flood of well-heeled bargain hunters gracing its aisles as data shows that as many as 50.1per cent of British households shop at discounters Aldi or Lidl.

In the past, middle class shoppers had turned their noses up on the rising tide of budget chains, but changed their minds in these more straitened economic times, attracted by a raft of award winning products.

But the firm said there had been a ‘further broadening appeal of Poundland’s offer’ with the ‘AB demographic’ – the highest earning categories of people – now representing 22per cent of its customer base.

This helped drive record festive trading with sales up 12.4per cent to £348.8million in the 13 weeks to 31 December 2013 compared to the same period last year.

Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘This is a high for us. There has been a shift in shopping behaviour generally. Over the past five years the economic challenge has meant customers have become accustomed to shopping for value.

‘Now there is a very positive feeling in a discounter when you save money rather than any stigma. It bodes well for the good times - when shoppers have confidence they tend to spend a little more.’

McCarthy said the business has been stocking more premium products including healthy nuts, hair accessories and a nail bar.

It has also sold gold buggy battery chargers in the past and its own lable milk chocolate.

In November Poundland opened its 500th store, in Birmingham and the business now trades from 517 Poundland and Dealz stores.

It has ambitions to open 1,000 more and float on the stock market.
