An 11-year-old boy was rushed to hospital on Monday afternoon after being bitten by a shark in the waters off central Florida.

Kyle Kirkpatrick was bitten while swimming with his father on Monday near Ormond Beach.

He was trying to catch a wave when he felt something tug at his foot. When Kyle turned around, his foot hurt and he saw blood in the water. 

Kyle says he saw the shark's dark shadow in the water and his foot started hurting

‘I was trying to catch a wave and all of a sudden I felt something on my foot and it started hurting,' he told WKMG.

Kyle said he saw the shark's dark shadow in the water.

'I turned behind me and I'm like what happened and then I see blood everywhere and and my dad picks me up and brings me to shore.’

Todd Kirkpatrick scooped up his son and rushed to the beach, where an off-duty paramedic put gauze on the wound and called 911.

Kyle says he'll go swimming again and he dad, Todd, has said the injury could have been a lot worse

At a local hospital doctors put three stitches in Kyle's foot.

‘He still has his foot, still has full function of it, it could have been much worse,' said Todd Kirkpatrick.

Kyle says he'll go swimming again ‘but it'll be kind of scary.’

Doctors believe it was a baby shark that bit him in the foot.

In 2012, there were eight shark bites in Volusia County, most of them minor.
