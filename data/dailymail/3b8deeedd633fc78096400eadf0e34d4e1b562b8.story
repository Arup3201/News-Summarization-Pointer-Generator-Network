People in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff and nine other UK cities are set to get double their 4G internet speeds as broadband provider Everything Everywhere (EE) turns on its superfast network.

The speed boost - which is twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G - will make it easier to watch HD videos without buffering, share high-resolution pictures and send large files in seconds. 

The rest of the cities set to receive the boost are Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield.

Network provider Everything Everywhere has announced it is rolling out its double-speed 4G network to 12 UK cities including Bristol, Derby, Birmingham and Cardiff. The boost will make the UK 4G network the best in Europe and equal the fastest speeds in South Korea

EE launched its 4G network in 16 UK cities and 12 of those are now set to get the double-speed boost

The plans will give the UK a 4G network that is unrivalled in Europe - faster than the U.S. and Japan, and equal to the world's fastest speeds in South Korea.

EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK.

The company said its double speed will see EE’s network reach a theoretical maximum top speed of 150Mbps.

EE will be making double-speed 4G available to all existing 4GEE customers while they remain on their current 4GEE plan.

Chief executive Olaf Swantee said: 'Last year we launched the first superfast 4G and Fibre broadband network in the UK.

'Now we’re staying one step ahead with the launch of double-speed 4G and a range of new innovative plans and services designed to transform the way our customers connect and share content.

'Our new double-speed 4G technology means that we have the biggest, fastest and best network in the UK, and now the equal fastest in the world.

'With our superfast network, we have a unique opportunity to introduce a new era of customer-friendly pricing models based on speed, and we’ll be revealing further details of this later this year.

EE also announced it is to launch a new range of services later this month, aimed at making it as easy as possible for people to access its superfast network.

The services include Shared 4GEE Plans, 
allowing customers to connect up to five separate devices to one plan, 
with one bill for all their devices, as well as a new range of 
pay-as-you-go 4GEE mobile broadband plans.

A South Korean model shows off Samsung's smartphone displaying the wireless data speed of SK Telecom's LTE-Advanced network in Seoul today. SK Telecom announced last week that its network offers speeds twice that of its existing long term evolution (LTE) network and 10 times faster than 3G services

The firm is also launching Cash on Tap, in partnership with MasterCard - a way for customers to make payments via their mobiles - as well as the Bright Box 2 wireless router, designed to offer a stronger Wii-Fi signal, for fibre broadband customers later this summer.

Commenting on the plans, Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'I think it's an incredible roll-out, and a testament to the network that it has met – and in some instances exceeded – what were seen as incredibly ambitious plans for a 4G network back in September.

'Test speeds of 150Mbps, translating into real world figures of 24 to 30Mbps, rival the latest technologies – the likes of LTE-A (LTE Advanced) – and would certainly see the UK rubbing shoulders with the Far East and eclipsing Europe and the US alike.

EE's double speed plans match those recently announced in South Korea.

South
Korea's largest mobile operator., SK Telecom Co, is launched what it 
said was the world's fastest wireless network last week.

The
LTE-Advanced network can download data at speeds twice as fast as 4G 
networks and 10 times faster than 3G services, according to SK Telecom 
Co.

With a transfer rate of 150 megabits per seconds, the network can download an 800 megabyte movie in just 43 seconds.

This compares with around 80 seconds on the current LTE network.

The service will be initially available in Seoul and its suburbs.

'Not only is EE bumping up speeds, it is also doubling the breadth of 1800Mhz spectrum supporting 4G, which will hopefully head off the chance of congestion on the network.

'All we hope is that these developments and advancements within its 4G infrastructure are not to the detriment of Orange and T-Mobile customers still using their 2G and 3G services.'

Elsewhere, Sony has teamed up with mobile payments platform Boku to let customers pay for items from the Sony PlayStation store and Sony's Entertainment Network using their mobile phones.

Sony users will be able to buy content using their phone number, without having to enter credit card details, and the charges will be added to a customer's mobile phone bill.

EE’s 4G network is expected to cover 98 per cent of the population by the end of next year.

Its double speed plans match those recently announced in South Korea.

South Korea's largest mobile 
operator SK Telecom, launched what it said was the world's 
fastest wireless network last week.

The LTE-Advanced network can download 
data at speeds twice as fast as 4G networks and 10 times faster than 3G 
services.

With a transfer rate of 150 megabits per seconds, the network can download an 800 megabyte movie in just 43 seconds.

This compares with around 80 seconds on the current LTE network. The service will be initially available in Seoul and its suburbs.
