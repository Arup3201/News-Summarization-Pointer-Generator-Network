Country singer Taylor Swift offered comfort and solace to her grieving boyfriend Conor Kennedy during a visit to his mother's grave at the weekend.

The 22-year-old Grammy winner 
accompanied the eldest son of RFK Jr., and his other
siblings, to the St. Francis Xavier
Cemetery in Massachusetts. 

The Kennedy clan has been gripped by grief since Mary Richardson Kennedy, 52, tragically hanged herself this past spring.

Support: Taylor Swift joined her boyfriend Conor Kennedy and his siblings on a visit to his mother's grave at the St. Francis Xavier Cemetery in Massachusetts over the weekend

Solemn moment: Conor sought comfort in his country singer love

But Taylor has provided joy amid the 
heartache for Conor, 18, with the pair enjoying their fledgling romance at 
the family's Cape Cod estate this summer.

The pair walked hand-in-hand to the Hyannis cemetery and stopped for hugs.

Conor
was wearing a grey T-shirt and shorts, with Swift looking summery in a 
red floral print A-line dress, Ray Ban sunglasses, and leather shoes.

The
couple, who was seen caressing just a day before, appeared solemn at 
his mother’s grave, and at one point appeared to bow their heads in 
prayer, as did Kennedy’s siblings.

Paying their respects: Taylor is now a fixture among the Kennedy clan

Tragedy: Conor's mother Mary Kennedy committed suicide in May after battling depression

According
to the New York Daily News, Kennedy also reached down to clear some brambles and
overgrown grass from his mother’s yet-unmarked grave.

Mary
Kennedy hanged herself on May 16 in a barn behind the couple’s 
home in Bedford, New York, amid bitter divorce proceedings and a battle 
with depression and addiction.

Swift, who is said to be worth as 
much as $80million, reportedly purchased a $5million Cape Cod mansion 
next to the Kennedy’s sprawling estate.

Inseparable: The pair held hands as they left the graveyard

Before the sombre visit, the young couple attended mass together.

Their romance has not been without controversy however.

Victoria Gifford Kennedy today claim the Taylor crashed her daughter Kyle's wedding in Boston on Saturday.

The mother of the bride said Conor was invited to her daughter's nuptials to Liam Kerr, but failed to RSVP.

'[Swift and Conor] texted me an hour 
before the wedding and asked if they could come. I responded with a very
clear 'Please do not come.' They came anyway,' she told the Boston 
Herald.

She made it clear she did not want Swift detracting attention from her daughter on big day.

'I personally went up to Ms. Swift, 
whose entrance distracted the entire event, politely introduced myself 
to her and asked her as nicely as I could to leave,' she added. 'It was 
like talking to a ghost. She seemed to look right past me.'

But Swift's spokesperson shot back at
the claims, saying: 'Taylor was invited to the wedding and the bride 
thanked her profusely for being there.'
