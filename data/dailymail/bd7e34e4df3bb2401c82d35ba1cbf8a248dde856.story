Pep Guardiola put his Bayern Munich players through their paces on Wednesday evening as the German champions returned to training for the first time since the winter break.

Bayern have not played since beating Mainz 2-1 on December 19 before the customary break during the Christmas and New Year period.

The players looked in good spirits at the first session of 2015 as Bastian Schweinsteiger was pictured laughing and joking while Franck Ribery enjoyed a cosy-looking cuddle with Bayern coach Domenec Torrent.

Guardiola's squad have every reason to look relaxed, too. Bayern went into the winter break top of the Bundesliga without losing a match in the opening half of the season.

The 2013 Champions League winners have only dropped six points and Guardiola will be keen for his side to continue their eight-game winning streak when the Bundesliga resumes at the end of the month.

Bayern face a tough trip to second-place Wolfsburg on January 30 in the opening league match of 2015 after the six-week hiatus.

Before that Bayern have the opportunity to re-discover their pre-winter rhythm when they play a friendly against second division Bochum on January 23.
