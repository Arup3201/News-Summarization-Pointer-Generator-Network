When it comes to love and marriage, every couple is different. We only have to look at the celeb world to see various examples of the lovers who have sailed though marriage and the those with unions that are somewhat battle bruised.

But what makes one couple last and another fall at the first (or fifth) hurdle and - more importantly - do you have what it takes to last the distance?

Most of the reputable research points to seven, significant factors in making your relationship work.

Tracey Cox says that there are seven significant signs to tell whether your love will last the distance or simply fizzle out

You feel closer after an argument

Sure you're raw, exhausted and a little fragile but you both feel closer than you did before the row. You've managed to talk it through rationally, listened to each others' viewpoints and come up with a solution that suits both of you.

You don't let jealously get out of control

If there's one thing that can destroy a perfectly good relationship rapidly, it's inappropriate jealousy.If - instead of losing it and storming out or trying to get even by flirting with someone else - you confess jealous feelings and allow yourself to be ­reassured, you're on track for success.

Couples tend to become less jealous of each other the longer you're together for obvious reasons.People vote with their feet, so if you're still together a few years on, you start to relax. You also get a better sense of whether someone is worthy of your trust.

You don't take a dubious comment the wrong way

If your partner says something that could be misconstrued, you'll put the best possible light on it rather than think the worst.

For example if your partner says:  'All I want to do is turn on some trash telly. I'm sick of everyone.' Instead of getting huffy and assuming they're included you 'everyone', you say, 'I know what it's like. Let me get you a nice big glass of wine.'

Or, if your partner doesn't feel like sex, you simply think, they must be tired, not, they don't fancy me anymore.

Tracey says that smart lovers keep each other hungry for more

You don't change to suit each other, you work with each other

No-one really wants to change because we all secretly think we're perfect!

What feels more natural is to both be aware of each other's bottom line – what you each will and won't put up with – while allowing each other to be individuals.

You're on track for a long-lasting relationship when there's a certain standard of behaviour that's expected, but you're not rigid.

Neither of you compromise those standards, but you are prepared to put their needs before your own occasionally.

You think first, react later

Everyone sees the world differently, through a different filter. If you truly accept each other, you'll allow for differences.

If your partner's being extraordinarily critical of someone or something, you'll listen first to what they have to say, take into account any stresses and how tired they are, then throw in your two pence worth – if at all.

Important issues are worth fighting over; trivial differences aren't.

You know how to say goodbye

Your partner is about to head off for a two-week work conference overseas.

You don't cling on, sob and feel miserable and resentful they're having time away from you. You take them to the airport, kiss and hug, then wave them off cheerily.

A graceful exit is the best preparation for the next grand entrance.

Smart lovers keep each other hungry for more.

You both feel you're getting a fair deal from the ­relationship

Last but crucially important, ask yourself this: Who's getting the best deal from this relationship: me or my partner? Are they getting much more out of it than you or vice versa?

Couples who honestly answer, 'It's fairly equal', are those who report the highest relationship satisfaction.
