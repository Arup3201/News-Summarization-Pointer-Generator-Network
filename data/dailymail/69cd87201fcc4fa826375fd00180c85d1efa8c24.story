In the end, Cesare Prandelli did the decent thing. Italy have won four World Cups and his countrymen demanded a fifth.

Prandelli has quit, resigning after a 1-0 defeat against Uruguay in Natal knocked them out. England’s head coach should have quit, too, after the worst World Cup campaign in this country’s history.

Hodgson is a decent man — as we have placed on record many times — but we will be surveying the wreckage of this tournament for years to come. At the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte, we couldn’t even beat Costa Rica. They are ranked 28th in the world. Two years ago Prandelli led Italy to the final of Euro 2012. Football is a cruel game.

We came to Brazil with dreams of making our mark. Instead England arrive home after the worst World Cup showing in the history of the national team. Their credibility as a footballing power is shot to pieces after defeats by Italy and Uruguay and a lifeless 0-0 draw with Costa Rica.

At the centre of the farce is manager Roy Hodgson, still in his job despite his failure and last night bizarrely claiming that England hadn’t been outplayed or outclassed.

He said: ‘All I can say is we haven’t been that fortunate here... we haven’t got the results. If you’re Iran, and you play with eight or nine behind the ball and make incredible stops and draw 0-0, you’ve had a great game. That’ll never be the case with England. The pressure for teams like England is greater.’

After this debacle, expectations have never been lower.

Watching 
Hodgson, shredded by the experience of a World Cup that he has already 
conceded he underestimated, it is time for someone else to have a crack 
at the top job. It is the most prestigious job in English football and 
whoever turns this team into a formidable, fighting machine in the 
future will be lionised.

But the FA have backed and offered their full support for  Hodgson, a man who loves this job more than anything in life.

No-one disputes that.

After
 touching down in England with the rest of the squad, Hodgson will 
return to his new home in  Chelsea to spend some time with his wife. It 
is today, and in the weeks ahead, when Hodgson has to work out a way to 
glue this all back together again.

Against Costa Rica there was no pattern to England’s performance, no encouragement. The future is frightening.

Hodgson
 spent the entire game in the dug-out, leaving the motioning and 
pointing in the technical area to his assistant Ray Lewington.

It
 is possible that he felt embarrassed, particularly after his admission 
that he had underestimated the World Cup in Brazil. For future 
reference, football tournaments do not come any bigger than this one. After
 this sterile 0-0 draw with the group winners, Hodgson claimed that 
England’s  performance had given the  supporters something to cheer 
about. That is some claim.

He said: ‘They gave us an ovation that, obviously, our results didn’t merit.

‘We
 wanted more. The reaction of the fans was quite brilliant. We are so 
sad and disappointed for them because we know what they’re going 
through. We are very grateful for the emotional moment at the end where 
they showed their support.’

England finished bottom of Group D after losing to Italy and Uruguay in their opening two fixtures. They were spared the ultimate humiliation by drawing 0-0 with the group leaders to gain one point.

It
 is true that the thousands who made the trip to Belo Horizonte and were
 stationed behind the goal saluted the players at the whistle.

Daniel Sturridge had run over to them and thrown his No 9 shirt into the crowd before the rest of the team arrived.

But
 to think that anyone who watched this game believes this was a good 
performance is living in a fantasy land, and the least the fans deserve 
is some honesty.

What cannot be overlooked is that this tournament has been an unmitigated disaster and we are sick of hearing empty promises.

To
 hear that we are building for the future again must make every 
supporter sick to the stomach. Let’s build for the here and now.
