Former UFC middleweight Ryan Jensen turned into a detective when he left the gym to find out his car had been broken into and robbed.

Jensen may not have enjoyed the most successful of UFC careers, having won just two of six bouts, but there was no way he was going to lose this battle.

The 37-year-old instead he scoured the CCTV system of the gym he was training at when the robbery happened.

The video recordings showed a man and a woman breaking in to the car before speeding off in a black car just minutes later.

And rather than cancelling all his cards the fighter, who has been in the Octagon alongside the likes of Thales Leites, Demian Maia and Mark Munoz, kept track of their spending.

His detective work eventually led him to a nearby Walmart store as payment history showed that was the last place his cards had been used.

Surprisingly the suspects were still in the supermarket car park when he arrived and he used his ransacked car to block the culprits in.

One of the crafty duo ran into the store, but luckily police were on hand to apprehend the crooks.
