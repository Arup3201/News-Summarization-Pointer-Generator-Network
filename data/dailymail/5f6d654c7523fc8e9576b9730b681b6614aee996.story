Council leaders across England are demanding more control as constitutional turmoil over the proposed new terms for Scotland deepens.

The leaders of 119 councils warned that voters in England will not accept greater devolution to Scotland unless there is a similar redistribution of power south of the border.

The councils – including 65 controlled by Labour, 40 by the Conservatives and ten by the Liberal Democrats – want powers over tax and spending similar to those being given to Holyrood in the aftermath of Scotland’s No vote in September’s independence referendum.

Among those who have issued the warning are the leaders of several big councils in the traditional Tory heartlands, including Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Oxfordshire county council, which covers David Cameron’s constituency of Witney.

There is also a growing clamour for ‘English votes for English laws’, ensuring legislation that no longer affects Scotland cannot be forced on to the rest of the UK by the votes of Scottish MPs.

Yesterday, Labour’s Ed Balls criticised proposals being drawn up by the Coalition, expected to be unveiled before Christmas, to ensure the influence of the predominantly Labour MPs in Scotland is reined in.

Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the Shadow Chancellor said the Prime Minister was ‘trying to play party politics with our constitution and the future of our country’.

Yesterday, Labour’s Ed Balls criticised proposals being drawn up by the Coalition to ensure the influence of the predominantly Labour MPs in Scotland is reined in.

He insisted: ‘The Government’s own McKay Commission said there is an issue of fairness around voting – we need to find a way to solve that... but if you start having different classes of MPs, you will destroy the Union and undermine prosperity in every part of our country. I’m not going to be part of that.’

But former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said: ‘If Labour agree that the Scots Parliament shall fix income tax rates in Scotland it must also accept that Scots MPs in Westminster can no longer vote on income taxation levels for the rest of the United Kingdom.

‘A commitment to devolve income tax levels to Holyrood without simultaneously addressing the perversities of the West Lothian question is frankly outrageous.

‘There is a tipping point when the voters in England will say this far and no further. Labour seem to be blind to this.’

Instead of a system of English votes, which would permanently hobble its powerbase at Westminster, Labour is trying to focus on devolution of power to the regions.

It has proposed scrapping the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected second chamber of senators representing different parts of the country.

Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said devolution within England is now inevitable: ‘Devolution isn’t just for Scotland. If we want to get the economy moving in all parts of the country, we need to give local communities more power to shape their own future.’

The council leaders, in a letter to the Observer newspaper, called on Chancellor George Osborne to use his autumn statement on Wednesday to set out a ‘new settlement for England’ which devolves power from Westminster and shares out tax and spending across the UK ‘on a fair basis’.

They wrote: ‘Earlier this week, the Smith commission [on Scottish devolution] set out a better deal for Scotland, granting more control over funding and recognising the importance of devolving power down beyond Holyrood. It’s England’s turn now.

‘The people we represent, who look north of the border with envy at the greater control Scots are to get... will expect nothing less.’

The leaders also claimed local government could not afford any more austerity cuts. ‘Funding for services provided by councils has borne the brunt of austerity, while demand continues to rise,’ they wrote.

‘Further reductions without radical reform will have a detrimental impact on people’s quality of life.’

However, local government minister Kris Hopkins warned: ‘Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending and must play its part in paying off the deficit left by the last administration.

‘Since 2010, this Government has delivered a fair settlement to every part of the country while giving them greater financial independence so they can increase revenue and protect frontline services.’
