Charged with sexual offences: Dave Lee Travis arrives back at his home in Bedfordshire tonight

Dave Lee Travis vowed to clear his name last night after he was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s.

The 68-year-old, one of Britain’s best known DJs, said he is ‘very much looking forward’ to proving his innocence.

The former Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops presenter is accused of  11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault over a 30-year period from 1977.

The allegations relate to eight women aged between 18 and 29 at the time and a girl of 15.

Senior lawyers said no further action would be taken concerning another seven allegations.

Travis, who was charged under his real name David Patrick Griffin, will appear before Westminster magistrates next Friday.

He has vehemently protested his innocence since his initial arrest nine months ago.

Dressed in grey jeans, a white open-neck shirt and a striped jacket, he looked despondent as he returned last night to the £1million Buckinghamshire mansion he shares with his wife Marianne.

He said: ‘To say the least I am very disappointed that the police and CPS have decided to bring these charges. These allegations are not true and I think the only other thing I can add to that statement is that I am very much looking forward to actually clearing my name on this and I can’t say more than that.’

Asked what toll it was taking on his family, he added: ‘We’ve had a stressful time, obviously. It’s been quite a long time while all this has been going on and I am looking forward to the day when there is no stress.’

Speaking: Travis was the fourth celebrity to be arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal

Will appear in court: The 68-year-old is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault and a count of sexual assault

Travis was charged as part of  
Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree inquiry, set up in the wake of the 
Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate historic claims of sex abuse.

One of the indecent assault charges 
relates to an 18-year-old woman in 1977; two to a 15-year-old in the 
same year and one to a 19-year-old in 1978.

Dave Lee Travis, 68, of Bedfordshire, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on August 23. The charges are:

Prosecutors
 have decided that no further action should be taken in relation to 
seven separate allegations made against the DJ because there was not 
enough evidence.

Another said to have occurred  between
 1981 and 1983, involved a woman aged between 26 and 28; one relates to 
an 18-year-old in 1983; one to a woman aged 19 or 20 in 1985; one to a 
22-year-old in 1990; and three between 2000 and 2003 to a woman aged 26 
at the time of the first allegation.

Travis is also accused of sexually assaulting a 23-year-old in 2007.

Alison Saunders, of the Crown 
Prosecution Service, said: ‘Having completed our review, we have 
concluded that there is sufficient  evidence and it is in the public 
interest for Mr Griffin to be charged.’

Travis, whose nicknames include DLT 
and The Hairy Cornflake, has denied being a sexual predator and claimed 
he was simply a ‘man who loves women’. Shortly after his  initial 
arrest, he dismissed the  allegations and said he was  simply accused of
 ‘squeezing the boobs of a couple of women’.

He said he was appalled to have his name linked to one-time colleague Savile.

The charges were welcomed by his alleged victims.

Solicitor Jessica Standley, of Slater 
and Gordon, which represents several of the women, said: ‘Our clients 
are relieved that after this length of time, careful consideration has 
been given to the evidence and a decision has been made to prosecute. It
 takes a great deal of courage for people to come forward with this kind
 of allegation and our clients look forward to having their voices heard
 in a court of law.’

The pace of the controversial Yewtree 
inquiry shows no sign of slowing. On Monday an unnamed 80-year-old man 
linked to Savile was arrested in South London on suspicion of sexual 
assault.

Travis is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on August 23 charged with 12 sexual offences

On the same day, former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, who was originally arrested in June, had his bail renewed until October.

Last week veteran entertainer Rolf 
Harris, 83, was arrested for a second time. Two other suspects, comedian
 Jim Davidson, 59, and his friend and DJ Mike Osman, 53, could soon 
learn whether they will face charges after files were passed to the CPS.

Gary Glitter, 69, and Freddie Starr, 70, are both on bail.

Two people have been charged. PR 
supremo Max Clifford 70, is accused of indecently assaulting seven women
 and girls, and former BBC driver David Smith, 67, is accused of 
sexually abusing a young boy. They will face trial next year.
