A leading public health expert's proposal to lower the age of consent to 15 has been swiftly rejected by the Prime Minister.

Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said society had to accept 'the facts' that around a third of boys and girls have sex at 14 or 15.

He argued that lowering the current legal age of 16 would make it easier for 15-year-olds to get sexual health advice from teachers and health workers.

Professor John Ashton says the Government should consider lowering the age of sexual consent to 15

Countries in Europe that have lower 
ages of consent tend to see teenagers starting sexual relationships 
later and have lower rates of teenage pregnancy, he claimed.

But Downing Street shot down the 
idea, saying the age at 16 was in place to protect children and there 
were 'no plans to change it'.

Prof Ashton said lowering it by a year could actually prevent teenagers having sex at 14 or younger.

He said: 'I would not personally 
argue for 14 but I think we should seriously be looking at 15 so that we
 can draw a line in the sand, and really, as a society, actively 
discourage sexual involvement under 15.

'By doing that you would be able legitimately to organise services to meet the need.'

He added: 'I suspect we might be 
better off with it at 15 because the teachers and people who are in 
contact with young people would feel on a firmer footing pointing them 
in the right direction where they can get advice and contraception to 
protect their physical health from disease and other problems.'

The president of the Faculty of Public Health says society sends 'confused' signals about when sex is permitted

The Faculty of Public Health, which 
represents doctors working in this field, is independent of government 
but advises ministers and civil servants.

The age of consent is 14 in Germany, 
Austria, Hungary, Italy and Portugal. It is 15 in Denmark, France, 
Greece, Sweden and Poland, and 16 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Luxembourg and Finland. In Spain it is 13 but is being raised to 16.

Nick Clegg said he was worried about 
'high levels of teenage pregnancy' but thought 'modernising' sex 
education in schools rather than lowering the age of consent was the 
answer.

Labour spokesman Luciana Berger agreed that changing the age of consent was not the way to tackle teenage pregnancy.

'I'm
 worried, like everybody's worried, about the sexualisation of the 
culture and the information that so many young people are bombarded with
 at the moment. That's why I do want see action,' he told BBC1's The 
Andrew Marr Show.

'I'm 
constantly urging (Education Secretary) Michael Gove and the Department 
for Education to update and modernise sex education in schools which 
hasn't kept up with the internet age.

'But do I think simply a blanket reduction in the age of consent is the answer to this difficult dilemma? No.'

Nick Clegg said he does not think lowering the age of consent was the solution to the problem

Shadow public health minister Luciana Berger said Labour opposed lowering the age of consent and called for mandatory sex and relationship education.

Ms Berger said the opposition had tried to get such changes enshrined in law but Tory MPs blocked the moves in Parliament.

She said: 'Lowering the age of consent is not the way to tackle teenage pregnancy and we are against such a move.

Shadow public health minister Luciana Berger called for mandatory sex and relationship education

'The teenage pregnancy rate fell substantially under the last Labour government. But sexual health clinics are now closing their doors and young people are struggling to get appointments.

'Labour has called for improved sex and relationship education, and tabled amendments to recent legislation for it to be made mandatory, not voluntary, in all schools.

'Regrettably, the change was voted down by Tory MPs.'

In 1875 the Offences Against the Persons Act raised the age of sexual consent from 12 to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland. Ten years later, the Criminal Law Amendment Act raised it again, to 16.

According to organisations such as the International Child and Youth Care Network, an age of consent of 16 criminalises more than half the teenage population and makes it hard to give them proper advice and support to prevent diseases, unwanted pregnancies and abuse.

The Faculty of Public Health, part of the
 Royal Colleges of Physicians, gives advice to ministers and civil 
servants although it is independent of government.
