Move over Cronuts, here comes the pizzaburger.

Created by Boston’s Restaurant and Sports Bar, the pepperoni pizza-wrapped bacon cheeseburger packs a walloping 1,360 calories and 2,000 milligrams of sodium. Available now in the chain’s 40 US restaurants, it was initially launched at a Canadian subsidiary.

The frankenburgers were conceived by company brass who wanted to have a little fun with the celebrity baby craze, a spokesperson told MailOnline.

Like a calzone: The burger is baked inside thee pizza and comes out like a calzone

Baked in the same pizza pans used to make personal pizzas, the frankenburgers and have no illusions of being healthy.

‘We're not pretending that it's a healthy product,’ Brad Bevill, vice president of marketing for the chain, told USA Today. ‘You're talking about a hamburger and pizza wrapped together.’

A YouTube video shows cooks placing the burger, with all the fixins, in a pizza pan complete with an uncooked pizza. The burger is then wrapped in the pizza and tossed in the oven. People are soon shown enjoying the creation.

The heart bombs are garnished with lettuce, pickle and tomato, but no one in the video seemed to have any need for them. They retail for $10.29 at one Connecticut location.

Initially launched during the Spring in Canada, at the ubiquitous Boston’s Pizza, the calzone-like creation bumped burger sales up 250 per cent, said the spokesperson. The burger is now available at the chain's US-based Boston's Restaurant and Sports Bar.

‘Canada’s been huge, and so far, so good, it’s been taking off pretty well,’ the spokesperson said.

The idea for the burger came when corporate decided to capitalize on the country’s fascination with celebrity babies – an obsession hilariously mocked in Conan O’Brien’s ‘If They Mated’ skits for years.

‘They wanted to do something fun and creative,’ said the spokesperson, asking ‘what if the pizza and the burger had a baby?’

They have, and the result of their unholy union is the pizzaburger.

The record holder: The Heart Attack Grill serves 10,000 calorie burgers, fries deep-fried in lard and butterfat shakes

Though unhealthy, this burger doesn't come close to the record-holding calorie bombs served at the Heart Attack Grill, in Las Vegas, NV.

The notorious restaurant serves bypass burgers, flatline fries deep-fried in pure lard and gives free food to anyone over 350 pounds - provided they climb onto a scale and prove it.

The shameless fast-food temple's quadruple bypass burger hold the Guinness World Record for 'most calorific burger,' with almost 10,000 calories. Thrown in a butterfat milkshake and fries for a staggering 12,410 calorie meal - the equivalent of over a week's worth of food.

At least one customer is known to have had an actual heart attack while eating in the restaurant.
