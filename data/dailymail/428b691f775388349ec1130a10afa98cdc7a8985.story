The Advertising Standards Authority is to formally investigate Channel 4's advertising for Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, after the Irish Traveller community successfully appealed the regulator's original decision.

Adverts used to promote the show have been criticised for using the words: 'Bigger. Fatter. Gypsier' in large letters across images of travellers, including one of young children.

The London Travellers' Unit and two members of the London Assembly have likened the word 'gypsier' to other terms deemed racist and abusive.

In March the ASA dismissed more than 370 complaints against the campaign, but decided that an investigation was unnecessary as Channel 4's TV and billboard ads were not likely to cause widespread offence.

Statement: Billboards advertising the hit show across the country have seen graffiti scrawled across

But now the ASA has made an embarrassing climb down and admitted its decision not to review the complaints was 'flawed.' 

The green light for the investigation to commence was given after a meeting between Lord Smith and independent reviewer Sir Hayden Phillips, a former senior civil servant.

The decision to investigate the series ,which has pulled in up to 8 million viewers, is damaging to the show's sponsor Honda and the car company admitted some viewers had rang them directly to lodge a complaint.

The posters appeared all over the country on billboards this year in the run up to the launch of the six-part series

They sparked outrage among the traveller community in Hackney, in East London, who even staged a street protest in opposition.

John Biggs is one of the members upset by the posters. He said: 'Channel 4 should show greater respect and restraint.'

Protest: The London Gypsy and Traveller Unit hold banners and placards reading: 'Ban these adverts and say sorry'

He wrote to the broadcaster with Jennette Arnold, who is also a member of the assembly, saying the adverts were 'totally inappropriate, offensive and disrespectful' and raised concerns that they would cause more 'ill feeling and discrimination'.

Meanwhile, travellers said they have been upset by the show and have found it 'insulting and degrading'.

The documentary makers have also been accused of portraying traveller men as 'menacing'.

The accusations came as earlier this month, the sons of Big Fat Gypsy Weddings star Paddy Doherty admitted their role in a violent street brawl between feuding gypsy clans.

Several men were involved in the punch-up when rival families clashed outside Manchester magistrates court in Spinningfields.

Britain's youngest Gypsy bride: Earlier this month Danielle Maughan, wed in a lavish ceremony costing £50,000 on the hit television show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, was one day past her 16th birthday when she married 21-year-old Brendan Joyce

Happily ever after: Danielle Maughan, 16, and her new husband Brendan Joyce, 21, walk back down the aisle as Mr and Mrs after the ceremony

The fight broke out after brothers John and Dougie Joyce appeared before magistrates, accused of attacking Paddy Doherty, their cousin.

John, David and Simon Doherty - Paddy’s sons - were arrested with members of the Joyce and Ward families after the fight, in the city’s busy business district last summer.

Eight men have now admitted their involvement in the violence which erupted as part of a long-standing feud between the groups and will be sentenced in June.

The popular show follows young gypsy couples in the run-up to their weddings and is notable for showcasing brides' extraordinarily extravagant wedding dresses and the provocative outfits of their teenage wedding guests.

In a statement yesterday the ASA said: 'Following a recommendation from the Independent Reviewer of ASA adjudications, the ASA Council has decided that its original decision not  to conduct a formal investigation into complaints about the Channel 4 Broadcasting Ltd’s advertising campaign for the TV programme Big Fat Gypsy Wedding was flawed. 

'It has decided that a formal investigation should now commence.

'In their evaluation, the Council noted that it had made its original decision without the benefit of knowing that the Irish Traveller Movement of Britain had complained and that this was a material fact to which they should have had regard.'
