It's believed to be packed with nutrients and vitamins, improve the skin and lower blood pressure.

It sounds like the perfect health food, it's free, and there is literally thousands of tonnes of it.

But would you tuck into a sloppy bowel of fluorescent green algae soup, verdant algae pancakes, or a bar snack of fried algae and nuts?

Abundance: The seas off China's Qingdao, may look infested to some, but to one clever chef, it's a vision of free food

It might not be our cup of tea, but in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province, where the beach has been swamped with one of the largest recorded annual blooms of the stuff, it simply makes sense to eat it.

The algae growth this year has covered a 29,000sq km area and is blamed for starving marine life of oxygen.

The scale of the spread has been blamed on warm seas, but many scientists point the finger at pollution for the phenomenon.

Some experts say that the algae blooms in water with high levels of nutrients, blaming farmers using too much fertiliser on their crops and cities falling to treat sewage properly.

Health benefits: Residents haven't been deterred from bathing and playing in the weed; now they can eat it too

This year the non-toxic algae bloom is worse than the 2008 growth which had to be cleaned up before the Olympic Games

It appears some local residents are also collecting the green sludge, perhaps to try cooking it themselves

It is twice as vast as the giant green bloom that was cleaned up before China hosted the 2008 Olympics.

While it hasn't deterred residents from taking a dip in the green syrupy waters, believing it to be good for them, officials are eager to get the weed cleaned up before it begins to rot.

This form of algae, a non poisonous sea lettuce known as Enteromorpha prolifera, can produce large quantities of hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas, when it decomposes.

But while it is fresh, chef Ma Hui, who manages Liangchu Feichanghao (Brilliant Kitchen) restaurant in Qingdao, is seeing the green infestation as an opportunity.

He told The Times: 'We felt that the algae was so green that it probably didn't have any bacteria in it, so we gathered some up and experimented with a few recipes. Successfully it turns out.'

Local residents have heard about his offerings and have been showing up in droves to give it a try.

On the menu is algae and duck soup, with eggs to offset the bitter taste, steamed green algae  pancakes, which have proven to be a winner at lunch, and a cold dish of algae and nuts - a steal at just £1 a plate.

'It tastes a bit like kelp and we find that our customers are very curious to know what all our algae tastes like. They hear about our recipes and then feel like they have to come here and try it personally,' he said.

With such curious appeal, it appears other restaurants are now also taking note and looking at ways to make a return on this free ingredient.

Perhaps it could become an annual delicacy in this part of eastern China.
