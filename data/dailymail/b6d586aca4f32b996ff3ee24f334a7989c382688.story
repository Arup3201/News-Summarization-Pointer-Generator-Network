Oscar looked to be in relaxed spirits as he posed for an Instagram photo with his sister and wife ahead of Chelsea's clash with Stoke on Monday.

The Brazilian's sister posted the picture to her account on Friday as the Blues' midfielder produced a big grin for the camera as he received two pecks on the cheek.

The 23-year-old had been exercising with his childhood sweetheart wife Ludmila and sibling Gabriele before the game at the Britannia Stadium.

Chelsea lead the Premier League by three points but that could be gone before they have even kicked off in Stoke as Manchester City face Crystal Palace on Saturday lunchtime.
