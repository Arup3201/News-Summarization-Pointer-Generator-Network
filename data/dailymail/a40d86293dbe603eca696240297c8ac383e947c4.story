He's not the tidiest of artists, and his paintings could at best be described as 'abstract' or 'experimental'.

But despite his 'conceptual' style and the fact, more importantly, that he is a capuchin monkey, there still appears to be a market for the work of animal artist 'Pockets Warhol'.

The white-capped capuchin uses his tail, hands, feet, and of course, a brush, to daub canvases with his own unique artistic stylings at Story Book Farm, a primate sanctuary in Canada.

Amazingly, Pockets Warhol has become a money-spinning machine for bosses at the home for primates, with his paintings selling for as much as £250 each.

The teenage monkey was introduced to painting a year ago when one of Story Book's volunteers, Charmaine Quinn gave him non-toxic children's paint to experiment with in order to keep him occupied.

She said: 'Pockets has always been very playful so he really took to painting, however, he does have an artistic temperament and can lack concentration, sometimes preferring to eat the paint.'

Bosses at the zoo claim Pockets Warhol's work has been sold to buyers in Europe and Israel for 'hundreds of dollars'.

All the money Pockets earns from the sales of his paintings will help fund a new barn for the sanctuary.

The talented monkey is having an art show where 40 of his paintings will be displayed in Sadie's Diner and Juice Bar on Adelaide Street for the next two months.
