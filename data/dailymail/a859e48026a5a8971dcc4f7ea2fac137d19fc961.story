The agency responsible for detaining and deporting illegal immigrants released more than 36,000 criminals living in the United States illegally last year, according to a new report.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency put rapists, murderers, kidnappers, dangerous drug dealers and other criminals who were in the process of being deported back on the streets the Center for Immigration Studies says.

Many of the criminals had more than one conviction, CIS says, for a combined total of nearly 88,000 criminal convictions.

The Obama administration has earned a reputation for deporting more 
illegal immigrants than its immediate predecessor. Since President Obama
 took office close to two million illegal immigrants have been deported.

Two-thirds of deportees have broken minor laws or no laws at, however, The New York Times reports. Only 20 percent illegal immigrants who are 
deported commit violent crimes.

'We keep hearing from the administration that they are focused like a laser on enforcement against the worst of the worst, convicted criminals, as their top priority. On the other hand, they are releasing, at a rate of about 100 a day, aliens from their custody with criminal convictions, and many of them are serious criminal convictions,' CIS policy studies director Jessica M. Vaughan told the Washington Times.

ICE arrested says it deported 216,810 criminal aliens in 2013 and arrested another 40,218.

Based on CIS's report, ICE released the majority of the criminal aliens it arrested but did not deport.

The Center for Immigration Studies report says ICE released 36,007 criminals who committed a combined total of 87,818 crimes in 2013. Of those, 17,228 convictions were for minor traffic violations and 15,635 came from DUIs.

Other crimes were more serious, including 
9,187 dangerous drug convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 
kidnapping convictions, 193 homicide convictions, 1,317 domestic 
violence convictions and 1,075 aggravated assault convictions.

Some of these criminals were placed under supervision, others were not. CIS said it was unable to obtain the breakdown of how many illegal immigrants were unsupervised, supervised, placed on parole or received alternatives to detention such as tracking devices.

ICE did not return the Washington Times' request for comment on the CIS report, but last year it blamed the looming sequester on a release of 622 immigrants.

'This is very hard for me to believe that they can’t find cuts 
elsewhere in their agency,' House Speaker John Boehner said in response to ICE's actions. 'I frankly think this is outrageous.'

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte also criticized the decision. 'By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives,' he said at the time.

The agency also said it had to let illegal immigrants go because did not have enough beds to hold all the people it was catching.

Yet, two months ago ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale told a 
House subcommittee that it would be requesting less money in 2015 for beds for detained illegal immigrants than it did the year before.

The agency is reducing the number of beds at its facilities from 34,000 to 30,509 next year, he said.

Ragsdale told members of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security that the agency that it would focus 'costly detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while placing lower-risk, non-mandatory individuals in lower cost alternatives to detention programs.'

'ICE will work to realize continued efficiencies in detention operations to achieve this bed rate level,' he said.

The Center for Immigration Studies questioned the timing of ICE's decision.

'The news that ICE
 released so many criminal aliens convicted of so many serious and 
violent crimes suggests that ICE could use more detention capacity, not 
less, in order to prevent further harm to the public from these 
individuals,' Vaughan writes in CIS' report.

Public pressure over deportations seems to be at work, the report argues, noting that, 'A number of criminal aliens in detention while awaiting completion of 
deportation proceedings have been the subject of petition campaigns, 
prayer vigils, demonstrations, and other forms of protest against 
enforcement.'

'Typically these protests occur on behalf of a criminal 
alien who has family members in the United States. ICE should be asked 
to disclose how many of these releases came after such appeals were made
 on behalf of criminal aliens,' the report says.

 Last year ICE said it had to release illegal immigrants because of budget cuts caused by the sequester

@highlight

It also said it did not have enough beds for all the illegal immigrants it was catching

@highlight

Yet, it told a House subcommittee two months ago it was cutting down on the number of beds in 2015 in favor of cheaper, alternative detention methods, like tracking devices

The Center for Immigration Studies chalked up ICE's decision to public pressure to reduce the number of people it was deporting
