Mystery: Vodafone executive Mark Breslin was found dead in America while on business as Head of Commercial Global M2M

Mystery today surrounds the death of a Vodafone executive found dead in America.

Father-of-two Mark Breslin - who was Head of Commercial Global M2M - was found by staff in a hotel bedroom in Seattle.

Mr Breslin, 39 - who had joint British-American Citizenship - was in America on business.

A post mortem has failed to find the cause of death and Seattle police continue to investigate his death.

Yesterday, Vodafone confirmed he was in the U.S. on business when he died at around 3pm on February 3.

A spokesman said: 'Mark will be greatly missed by us all and our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time.'

Yesterday, his distraught wife Imogen was too distressed to talk about his death at their Â£450,000 detached home in Chineham, Basingstoke, Hampshire.

The Vicar of Chineham The Rev Ian Bentley said: 'This is distressing. Anyone dying is sad particularly when they are far away from home.'

An inquest was opened and adjourned into his death in Basingstoke on Friday.

North East Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley was told police in Seattle were still investigating his death.

But he was told a post mortem had failed to find the cause of death.

Toxicology and histology tests were now taking place in America and would be sent to him later.

There was no trauma to his body, which has now been sent back to Britain.

The inquest was adjourned until March 14. One was also due to take place in the U.S.

Mr Breslin was born in America.
