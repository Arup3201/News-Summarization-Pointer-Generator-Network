Ireland caused one of the great upsets in Women's Rugby World Cup history as they beat New Zealand 17-14 in Pool B.

The Black Ferns have won the last four tournaments and had not lost a World Cup game since a defeat to the United States in the semi-finals in 1991.

They began reasonably well and led 8-0 courtesy of a Kelly Brazier penalty and Selica Winiata's try but Heather O'Brien's score, which was then converted by Niamh Briggs, cut the deficit to just one point at the break.

Brazier's second penalty extended New Zealand's lead but when Alison Miller went over with Briggs again adding the extras, it was the Irish who led by three.

Another Brazier penalty levelled the scores but Briggs slotted one of her own with 10 minutes remaining and Ireland held on for a famous victory.

The result moved Ireland to the top of Pool B ahead of their final group match against Kazakhstan on Saturday.

England made it two from two at the Women's Rugby World Cup in France, beating Spain 45-5 in the Pool A clash.

Head coach Gary Street's side scored six tries to Spain's one, with Kay Wilson, Danielle Waterman, Laura Keates, Claire Allan and Marlie Packer - with two - all scoring and Emily Scarratt adding 15 points with the boot.

After a cagey opening England broke the deadlock when a deft grubber through from fly-half Ceri Large bounced perfectly for Wilson to jump on for her third try of the tournament.

Scarratt converted the try from wide, and the Lichfield centre duly added a penalty after 33 minutes.

At 10-0 Spain continued to press, but some dancing feet from Waterman saw her get over the line for her 35th international try.

England went into the break 17-0 up, and started the second half with real pace.

First, Keates rumbled over to score after strong work from the pack before Allan was on hand to finish off a smart team move across the line for 31-0 and the bonus point.

Scarratt converted both with ease and had her sixth successful kick after Packer barged her way over the line for her first try of the World Cup.

With just over 10 minutes to play Spain were rewarded with their first try after a spell of pressure on England's line - Marina Bravo eventually diving over.

But it was England who had the final say. Packer scored her second try after more strong work from the pack and Scarratt rounded off the win with the conversion, her seventh from seven attempts.

Wales saw their Women's World Cup semi-final hopes ended by an emphatic defeat against Australia in Marcoussis.

Wales, emphatically beaten by hosts France in their opening game, were no match for an Australian side that ran out 25-3 victors.
