A restaurant's vigilante bid to find a couple who skipped out on their bill after an expensive meal and left a wallet emblazoned with a line out of the movie Pulp Fiction has gone viral after the establishment's owners posted a search warrant for the pair online.

A French couple allegedly ordered and ate an extravagant three-course meal, told the waiters they were going for a cigarette and left a wallet on the table for assurance while they stepped outside.

But the diners never returned and when the waitress picked up the wallet she found the words ‘bad mother***er’ ironically embossed on its underside.

The owners of Mojos restaurant in Bunbury, Western Australia, Juliana Frisina and Noel Brunning, took to their Facebook page on Sunday in a bid to track down the couple who walked out without paying on Saturday night.

Mojos status warned the couple that they have 'very identifiable tattoos and nose rings'

‘WANTED YOUNG FRENCH COUPLE. Could the young French couple who skipped paying their bill last night come back today & rectify the situation,’ the Facebook post read.

‘You have very identifiable tattoos & nose rings & work in a nearby farm. Man was heavily tattooed & the female had septum piecing in her nose.

‘We will get the footage off the security cameras & take to the Police tomorrow if you haven't settled your account by tonight ,’ they warned.

After they received an 'overwhelming' response from the local community they thanked everyone for their help

The post was shared thousands of times and has now been seen by almost 30,000 people but the couple did not return to the restaurant so the owners also posted a grainy CCTV image of the pair on Facebook.

A man is seen wearing a purple t-shirt and blue shirt, while a blonde woman is dressed in a black strappy top.

‘Wanted. This French Couple who skipped their substantial bill on Saturday 21st Feb at Mojo's. Anyone seen them, call Mojo's or CrimeStoppers. 1800333000,’ the update read.

Co-owner Ms Frisina told Daily Mail Australia: ‘They had a lovely time with their food and drink.

'It was a substantial amount for a couple.’

The French couple reportedly ordered a 'substantial' three-course meal from Mojos 

'It's the one that says bad motherf*****': The wallet the couple left on the table was reminiscent of the one Samuel L. Jackson owns in Pulp Fiction

The diners came for a three-course-meal at Mojos where the owners say 'most people are pretty honest'

She said she never expected the post to go viral, usually the restaurant’s Facebook updates only receive a few hundred ‘likes’.

‘We didn’t expect it to go out like it did, it quickly surpassed 10,000 views and is now up past 30,000.

‘We were just astounded at the community support, the way people jumped to support,’ Ms Frisina said.

‘This couple were intent on leaving. They left a couple of times for smokes out the front and then made a big show about leaving the wallet on the table, which turned out to be empty.

‘We don’t know who they are we only know they are French because they were conversing with our French waitress, they told her they were working in a farm,’ Ms Frisina explained.

Mr Brunning and Ms Frisina have reported the incident to local police.

‘Most people are pretty good and usually it’s a genuine mistake when someone runs away from a cup of coffee… most people are pretty honest,’ Ms Frisina said.
