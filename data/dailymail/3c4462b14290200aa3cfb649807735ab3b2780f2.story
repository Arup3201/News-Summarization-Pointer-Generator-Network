Sian Williams has trained as a trauma assessment counsellor following her own troubling experience covering the 2005 Pakistan earthquake.

The former BBC1 Breakfast presenter, 49, recalls dark and morbid moments upon returning to a hotel in Islamabad after a week of reporting from the disaster zone.

'Taking
 off my boots and frantically scrubbing them again and again. When I 
returned home to the warmth of my family, images of devastation and 
decay, the cries of distress and the sickly smell of disease and death 
lingered.'

Following her Pakistan ordeal Sian had to carry on her day-to-day work, like interviewing soap stars on the breakfast sofa.

The mother-of-four remains haunted to this day by a live 
broadcast she did from the epicentre as devastated brothers pulled their dead mother from 
rubble.

Speaking to the Observer, she says the memory of the disaster suddenly hit her again in 2010.

'I don't know what it was... some things
 in your career have an enormous impact, even if they don't resonate as 
important at the time.'

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects between 6 and 28 per cent of reporters covering 
distressing events. Veteran war reporters,
 at 28 per cent, face the same levels as combat veterans.Â 

While Sian doesn't 
think she suffered from the disorder herself, she says her experience in Pakistan drove her to help others and become part of a BBC team of trauma assessment counsellors.

'It is a struggle to get people to come forward. News journalists are in and out. They think they can cope,' she says.

Sian says journalists need protecting from themselves and need to 
be prepared before and after they go on assignment.

'A conscientious 
reporter will overwork. They are the ones typically most 
susceptible to acute symptoms of PTSD. They want to do everything, but 
they are not attending to their own health. You can talk to them before 
they go, get them to talk to some of the people they will be working 
for, so they have support, so they are explicit about what they can do, 
not taking constant calls and doing "two-ways".'

In
 her time as a reporter, she also covered the Hillsborough stadium disaster, 
the Paddington train crash and the Asian tsunami.

She is now studying for a master's degree in psychology at the University of 
Westminster, specialising in how reporters can
 be protected from the effects of PTSD 
after witnessing suffering, conflict, death and grief in their daily 
work.

Sian, who is marred for the second time to television producer Paul Woolwich, resigned from her TV presenting 
post in August 2012 following its relocation from London to Salford.

She authored an article on the issue for this month's Psychologist Magazine, and she interviews people who have survived extreme experiences, including the Asian tsunami, for a forthcoming ITV series.
