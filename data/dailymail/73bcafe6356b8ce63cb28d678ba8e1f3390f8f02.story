A crime novelist's Porsche was destroyed by arsonists in an attack that was similar to one of his storylines.

Andrew Towning believes the offender was inspired to set fire to his £18,000 Porsche Carrera outside his Dorset home after reading one of his crime-thriller novels.

The blaze caused a small explosion and sent flames 10ft into the air.

Burnt: The car was parked outside Andrew Towning's home in Merley, Dorset when it was set alight

In his 2010 book Shroud of Concealment, lead character Jake Dillon has his own Porsche 911 car blown up in the street after being targeted by a underworld crime gang.

Now Mr Towning fears he has been singled out by one of his readers following the attack at his home in Merley, near Wimborne, Dorset.

He wrote on his Facebook page: 'Some of you may know that myself and my family were subject to an horrific arson attack.

'In terms of the attack it bears uncanny resemblance to some of the incidents in my Dillon crime thrillers.

Damage: The blaze caused a small explosion which also damaged the author's wife's mini, pictured

Destroyed: One of the writer's daughters Eloise looks at the damage. The author said he was 'gutted' at the 'malicious' attack

'In terms of my real life, it is shocking, however the police are following up numerous leads, and are confident that they will find those responsible imminently.

'I will not allow this to intrude upon my family life or the Dillon series.'

He added: 'In my third book, the Shroud of Concealment, the lead character had his Porsche blown up in the street.

'I’m gutted, absolutely gutted that someone had the malicious nature to do it. I worked very hard to get that car and it is a car I would have kept forever.'

Response: The author took to social media to express his concern about the copycat attack

Investigation: Police are looking in to the cause of the blaze and are appealing for witnesses

Concern: The family say the car was the novelists 'pride and joy' and were in 'pristine condition'

The arson attack also caused damage to Mr Towning’s wife’s Mini Cooper car. Petrol was also thrown over his daughter’s Audi TT car parked in the drive.

The writer's daughter Harriet, 24, said: 'We think it was a copycat attack because lots of Porsches are blown up in my dad’s books.

'If it was a targeted attack then the person has chosen the thing he loves the most. It was his pride and joy and was in pristine condition.'

Police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses who saw a man carrying a green petrol canister running away from the property.

An exceptionally valuable Vermeer painting, stolen from a museum in Boston by art thieves, turns up in the private collection of the rich and powerful Charlie Hart.

Former army intelligence officer Jake Dillion investigates the crime - in a hope that his connections in the underworld will lead him to the gang.

But after a heated conversation with Mr Hart - where the officer not so subtly asks him where he got the painting - all hell breaks loose and his beloved Porsche 911 is blown up.

More worryingly, though, is that a contract is put out on him, his lawyer girlfriend and anyone he associates with.

But despite the threats, the officer begins to peel away the layers of a world of organised crime, gangs and even an unsolved heist that took place 25 years previously.
