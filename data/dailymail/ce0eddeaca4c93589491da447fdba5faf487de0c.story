Dior's new foundation has been designed to capture natural light on the face

Almost 70 per cent of women feel their skin looks dull, 
lacks radiance or features unsightly dark shadows or redness when they see themselves in photographs or 'selfies' on social media.

Just over 40 per cent admit they look to their foundation to give them confidence when they're photographed.

The research from Dior marks the launch of their new titanium-rich foundation, which the brand say makes users feel instantly more photogenic.

Called Diorskin Star, their new foundation is said to help women take the perfect selfie.

It has been designed to capture natural light on the face and enhance the cheekbones and eyes while banishing dull skin, shine and wrinkles.

Scientists spent two years developing a formula containing 'intelligent pigments' which help diffuse natural and artificial light over the skin.

The light bursting technology stops redness and shininess while 'amplifying radiance', according to the French cosmetics firm.

Dior claims its new foundation, Diorskin Star, makes users look instantly more photo-ready without the need for hours in front of the mirror.

This is supposedly down to the make-up's titanium-enriched silica beads, which 'neutralise imperfections in colour and texture and correct unevenness'.

The £32 foundation was tested under everyday conditions and then in a photographic studio using camera flash guns.

Diorskin Star has now been launched with Hollywood beauty Natalie Portman the face of the foundation.

Carlos 
Ferraz, a make-up artists for the likes of Mila Kunis and Eva Mendes, 
said: 'We now live in a digital age and, as everyone is a photographer, 
it is important our makeup is camera ready.

'Diorskin
 Star is perfect for bringing a good coverage with dewy, luminous and 
healthy looking skin - a great photogenic foundation.'

But Dior claims Diorskin Star is perfect for the selfie and social media-obsessed generation.

It features hollow spheres which allow two-dimensional light to reflect evenly through them.

They 
become a light source, making skin luminous, neutralising imperfections 
and correcting tonal irregularities at the same time.

The
 product also contains active, plant-based ingredients which encourage 
cell renewal, counteract dark spots and reduce redness.

A liquorice extract improves microcirculation, preventing a build-up of hemoglobin and resulting redness close to the surface of the face.

Edouard Mauvais-Jarvis, scientific communications director at Dior, added: 'Our specialist researchers who are experts in skin and the optical behaviour of cosmetic ingredients worked for two years to find a way to utilise titanium in a cosmetic way.

'Our objective was to make the face an ideal light source, emitting the largest amount of the purest light to be luminous.

'When light reaches the skin, only 10-15 per cent of the rays are reflected while the rest is absorbed. The more the light is backscattered, the more the skin is luminous.

'We have developed an industry first with the introduction of titanium-enriched silica beads which enables Diorskin Star foundation to release maximum light reflecting potential.'
