A man from North Carolina whose plane crashed whilst on a hunting trip in Alaska, has been recounting how he and his pilot survived three days in the Alaskan wilderness after their plane came down.

Larry Minton's camera was rolling when the J3 Cub aircraft crashed in what seemed like the middle of nowhere.

The aircraft flipped over before it came to a halt. Incredibly Mr Minton and the pilot were uninjured.

Crash: Larry Minton's plane crash landed miles from anywhere in the Alaskan wilderness

Lucky to be alive: Larry Minton says he feels 'blessed'. He and his pilot survived for three days in the Alaskan wilderness

Upside down: The plane flipped on crash landing but incredibly neither Larry or Pat, the pilot, were injured

Fault: The plane came down after the engine suddenly lost power during the flight

'Me and Pat had a little engine trouble,' he told WSOC. 'When it made racket, I knew we was going down. When it was going down, I just asked God to put us in a safe spot, and he did. We landed safe.'

The duo waited for a day and a half for rescuers to reach them, but no help arrived.

In the end they decided to tackle the wilderness head-on and took off on foot using a battery-powered GPS device and headed towards the nearest town, some 12 miles away.

Between them, they only had a tin of salmon and some trail mix.

Survivors: L:arry and his pilot, Pat, survived on a can of salmon and some trail mix for three days

The great outdoors: Larry was on a hunting trip and looking to shoot some moose

Caught on tape: He was able to film the entire crash landing as the plane made an emergency landing

Counting his blessings: Larry is ever-thankful that he survived the accident and is thanking God

'First thing in the morning at a stream whenever we'd drink all the water we could, then we'd take a pint with us. We crossed several streams and rough terrain and all,' Mr Minton said.

Crews searched everywhere for them and it took a total of three days before a recuse helicopter discovered them in a clearing.

'I said, 'Let's stay right here in the open a little while; they are going to find us, I feel it,' Mr Minton said.

He knows how lucky he and his pilot are.

'They did everything they could. It's a vast area. Like a needle in a haystack, it's tough to find somebody there,' he said.

Undeterred from the great outdoors, Mr Minton is already planning his next hunting trip - this time to New Mexico.

Saved: After three days in the wilderness, rescuers finally spotted them in a clearing and picked them up
