Manchester United's fringe players put in a pitiful display against MK Dons - with a humiliating 4-0 defeat highlighting why they cannot break into Louis van Gaal's first-team plans.

Captain for the night Jonny Evans could not have put in a worse display as he gave away the ball for Dons' first goal and disappeared from sight in the second half.  Javier Hernandez and Anderson were particularly awful and Danny Welbeck also struggled.

Here, Sportsmail dissects the performances of some of United's fringe players.

Jonny Evans 

Although not a fringe player, Evans may have played himself out of Van Gaal's first-team plans after an inept display against a League One side.

With the arrival of Marcos Rojo and with more signings expected, Evans' place in the team can no longer be guaranteed after this display.

The first goal was definitely his fault as - under no real pressure whatsoever - he casually passed the ball directly to Ben Reeves, who played in Will Grigg to open the scoring.

Evans also went missing for the second goal - as did the whole defence - and continued to be caught out of position in the second half.

As captain, Evans was expected to lead the young side to victory but instead his indecisiveness and wastefulness in position caused his team-mates to become nervous.

Not the way to introduce yourself to a new manager. Not by any stretch of the imagination. 

Struggle: Jonny Evans was unable to lead United well as captain and his mistakes led directly to goals

Out-muscled: Evans struggled all evening and he could not cope with the MK Dons forwards running at him

Anderson

Played a wonderful early ball through the middle to Hernandez on 10 minutes that the Mexican wasted, but that was unfortunately about as good as it got for the midfielder.

He put in an awful sliding tackle on double-scorer Grigg on the half-hour mark for which he should have been booked, and that was about as close as he got to winning the ball most of the night.

Anderson ambled around the pitch for long periods without looking like controlling the game. He was thoroughly out-played by a League One midfield, which basically says it all.

He totally lost the run of Grigg for MK Dons' second goal and allowed him to chest in unmarked.

United must off load him ASAP.

Please help me: Anderson put in an awful display for United and looks certain to be shown the exit door

Struggle: Anderson was bullied by a League One midfield in MK Dons and he was terrible most of the night

Javier Hernandez

This really was not the Mexican's night. Any potential suitors in the transfer market will not have been impressed with this display and may be getting cold feet over any deal.

Hernandez slipped over in first minute after a wonderful ball through from Welbeck and from then on looked rushed and low in confidence in front of goal.

On at least two occasions Hernandez should have scored for United but both times he blew his chances. 

First of all he turned his back on the ball in the 76th minute when he had a wide-open goal to aim at in an utterly baffling move. Then he had a chance from six yards with three minutes left on the clock that was blocked but the Javier Hernandez of two years ago would have buried it.

Extremely disappointing display. 

Waste: Javier Hernandez did not take any of the chances that fell his way and was extremely poor

Struggle: Hernandez looked short of match sharpness and should have scored at least twice on the night

Shinji Kagawa

Perhaps the only one of the fringe players who can leave Milton Keynes feeling like he may still have a future under Van Gaal.

He lasted just 20 minutes after he failed to recover from a heavy collision in the ninth minute.

Kagawa was left with a bloodied nose, blurry vision and mild concussion and left the pitch not knowing where he was - perhaps for the best!

Van Gaal has described Kagawa as someone who 'cannot hold' in midfield, so the arrival of Angel Di Maria will limit the attacking opportunities available to the playmaker even further.

Cut short: Shinji Kagawa was forced off the field with mild concussion and blurriness in the 20th minute

Unable to shine: Kagawa was not able to make his case to be regular starter after having his evening cut short

Danny Welbeck 

Strangely Welbeck was one of the few United players to start well but, as the visitors faded, the forward disappeared completely in the second half.

A wonderful counter-attack and ball in the box to Hernandez highlighted a brilliant start for Welbeck who looked pacey and full of intent, but he soon found himself starved of service.

He had one powerful effort from 20 yards that just crept wide but apart from that he rarely looked like scoring.

If he is to leave United you would think there will be plenty of suitors, but the game against MK Dons highlighted the frustration of Welbeck the player.

He can look so good yet he just does not deliver so often when it matters.

Frustrating: Welbeck looked good to begin with but, as United faded, Welbeck completely disappeared
