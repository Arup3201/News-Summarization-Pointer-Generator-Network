Animal welfare officers were called out to rescue a iguana stuck up a tree - only to discover it was a stuffed toy.

A woman spotted what looked like a lizard in a tree near Miller Academy in Thurso in the Highlands yesterday.

She alerted the Scottish SPCA, who had to break the news to the concerned caller that it was a cuddly toy which had been nailed to a branch.

This photo of a stuffed toy was discovered by a woman and mistaken as being a genuine iguana. It prompted a concerned call to the Scottish SPCA, who were pleased to tell her it was simply a stuffed toy nailed to a tree

Senior inspector Audrey Gunn said: 'The lady was shocked when I told her it wasn’t a real iguana as she thought she’d seen it blink.

'I think someone must have nailed the toy to the tree as a joke and I can see why it fooled her.'

The 'iguana' has been taken in by Ms Gunn’s colleague Mandy McIntyre, a reptile enthusiast who works for the charity.

The soft toy iguana, which has now been removed, was spotted on a tree near Thurso, Caithness in Scotland

She said: 'It was a nice surprise to find there wasn’t an animal in danger in this case and I must admit it gave Mandy and I a bit of a giggle.

'Although this incident turned out to be a false alarm, we’d always encourage people to give us a call if they think an animal is in need of help.'
