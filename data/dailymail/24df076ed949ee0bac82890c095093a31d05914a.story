A man has stabbed to death two government workers in China after they told him they couldn't register his fourth child, it has today been claimed.

Four other workers were injured in the incident, including one whose hand was severed.

They had told the man they were unable to record the birth because he had not paid a fine for breaching China's 'one child only' family planning laws, it has been reported.

Footage of the unnamed father outside a family planning office in southern China's Guangxi region, still brandishing a machete as police tried to subdue him has emerged.

A man is seen waving a machete after allegedly stabbed to death two government workers in China. It is believed they told him they couldn't register his fourth child because he had breached family planning policy

It comes after a months of protests against authority in China that have turned violent in recent months.

Thirty years ago the China introduced highly unpopular family planning rules which limited most urban couples to one child and rural families to two - if the first is a girl.

Family planning officials have confirmed that a man and a woman at the office died in the attack and four other workers were injured, including a woman who had her right hand cut off.

An official from the Family Planning Commission of Fangchenggang city said the suspect was certified mentally disabled.

Police wearing helmets and armed with long metal battled to bring the man them under control, according to footage broadcast on Guangxi TV.

Associated Press reports that the suspect has now been detained. 

The official Xinhua News Agency, said staff at the Dongxing City Family Planning Bureau - which comes under Fangchenggang city - had refused to register the man's fourth child for a hukou, or resident's certificate, because he hadn't paid a social compensation fee.

The man is believed to be a villager and has one son and three daughters. He was said to be trying to register a second son

The fine is levied on parents who break family planning laws and can be up to 10 times a family's annual income.

The man - named only by his last name He - is believed to have broken into the government building and attacked the six victim.

The man is believed to be a villager and has one son and three daughters. It is not known whether he has previously paid a social compensation fee. 

China has been besieged by cases of people who have turned to violence to attract attention to their fights for justice.

On Saturday, a motorcycle taxi driver detonated a homemade bomb at Beijing's main airport after eight years of frustration trying to seek redress for an attack by city guards that left him paralysed and in debt, according to his brother. 

And last month, a 60-year-old man reportedly chronicled online his unsuccessful efforts to get a local police station to correct his age so he could be eligible for social security payments.

A day later he reportedly set fire to a crowded commuter bus, killing 47 people.
