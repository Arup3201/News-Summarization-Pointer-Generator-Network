Arsene Wenger is set to hand Mikel Arteta the Arsenal club captaincy following the decision to sell Thomas Vermaelen.

The Gunners boss, whose side have been handed a tricky Champions League group stage play-off against Besiktas and their former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, needs a new skipper after allowing Vermaelen to leave for Barcelona.

Arteta, currently vice-captain, is the leading candidate. Per Mertesacker also features highly in Wenger’s thoughts but it is understood the German will be promoted to vice-captain.

Vermaelen was vice-captain when then skipper Robin van Persie left in 2012. 

Arteta’s future is unclear, given he has less than 12 months left on his current deal, but talks over an extension have begun.

Arsenal play their first leg in Turkey on August 19 before the return leg at the Emirates Stadium eight days later.

Moving on: After being strongly linked with Manchester United, Thomas Vermaelen is now off to Barcelona

Arsenal agreed to let Vermaelen go to Barcelona for £15m after Manchester United refused a swap deal involving Chris Smalling.

Arsenal were determined to push Vermaelen abroad unless United relented on Smalling, a player Arsene Wenger initially tried to sign from Fulham in 2010.

Barcelona director Raul Sanllehi travelled to London for talks this week and returned confident that Arsenal and Vermaelen would agree their terms on a four-year contract worth £80,000 a week.

The Belgium defender is now due to hold further talks with the Spanish side  prior to completing the transfer.
