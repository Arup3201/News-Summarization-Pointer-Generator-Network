Fined: Rebecca Gallanagh has been ordered to pay £140 for decorating her ankle tag

A fashion-conscious criminal who tried to 'bling' her electronic tag after being inspired by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has been fined £140.

Rebecca Gallanagh used nail glue to spell out her name in fake diamonds on the ankle tag which was meant to ensure she kept her curfew.

The 22-year-old has hit out at the justice system for wasting time on her case after she received the fine at Burton Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

Gallanagh was fitted with the 
electronic monitor in November after being convicted of a public order 
offence when she was involved in a fight outside a nightclub in her home
town of Tamworth, Staffordshire.

She
was ordered to observe a strict curfew requiring her to stay at home 
between 9pm and 7am for a period of three months, which forced her to 
give up her job at a local bar.

When
staff from Serco Home Affairs fitted the tag they told her she would be
allowed to decorate it however she wanted, she claims.

'The
lady who fitted the item said she saw a girl from My Big Fat Gypsy 
Wedding who had blinged her tag, and she said I could do that,' 
Gallanagh said.

'I saw pictures of it online and checked the leaflet, and nowhere did it say I couldn't decorate it.'

But
when she moved home in December and had to be fitted with a new tag, Serco workers 
saw the decoration and reported her to the authorities.

The company argued in court that Gallaghan had 'compromised the integrity' of the device with her diamanté design.

Magistrates agreed, telling the defendant she had committed a 'very serious offence' and slapping her with a £55 fine, along with £85 court costs and a £20 victim support surcharge.

Speaking after her court appearance, Gallaghan said the 'petty' case had gone too far.

'I wouldn't have wasted my time doing it if I knew I was going to be fined for it,' she said.

'It's a massive waste of time and money. There are all these people who go out and breach their orders, and all I've done is decorate my tag - that's just not right.

'I was actually proud of decorating the tag at the time. I wanted to make it look nice while I had it strapped to me around the house, it was a personal thing.

'Serco say I damaged the tag, but I didn't - I didn't touch the sensor, it was still working and I was being monitored.

She added: 'I did it to make me feel better about wearing it. I was quite proud of it. I like to bling things up, and wear blingy clothes and watches. It just matched my style.'

Her mother April, 48, said: 'It's pathetic. Once her tag was replaced she didn't decorate it again as she had learned her lesson.'

Gallaghan's lawyer Mark Moore said: 'This is a young girl who was coming up to Christmas - there were opportunities where she was out and about, and she was trying to make the tag look nice.'

Prosecutors for Serco said that decorating the strap 'could affect the device', but confirmed that there had been no other breach of Rebecca's curfew order.
