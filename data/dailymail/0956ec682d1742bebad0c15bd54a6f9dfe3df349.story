A Connecticut town has launched the country's first violent video game return program in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Officials and residents in Southington, which is 30 miles from where the killings unfolded in Newtown, will hold the event on January 12 for families to swap games for gift certificates donated by the Greater Southington Chamber of Commerce.

'We're concerned about our kids getting desensitized,' said John Meyers, executive director of the local YMCA, NBC reported. 'Desensitized to violence and desensitized to other risky 
behavior.'

Fears: A Connecticut town will hold a violent game exchange after Adam Lanza, who was said to be obsessed with Call of Duty (pictured), shot dead his mother, six teachers and 20 children last month

The event could be the first of many throughout the country after increased scrutiny over what leads mass murderers, such as Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, to commit such heinous crimes.

The 20-year-old gunman was said to 'obsessed' with the violent war game Call of Duty, which features assault weapons similar to the Bushmaster AR-15, one of three guns he used to slaughter his mother, six elementary school staff members and 20 children on December 14.

Other mass killers, including Anders Breivik in Norway in July 2011 and Mohamed Mera in Toulouse, France in March 2012, reportedly played the game in preparation for their killing sprees.

Following the Sandy Hook shooting, 
US Senator Jay Rockefeller introduced a bill to commission the 
National Academy of Sciences to investigate the psychological effects of
violent games on children.

Intervention: Group member John Meyers said he worries people are becoming desensitized to violence

Violent video games can alter the brain in just one week and make players more aggressive, researchers say.

An
Indiana University School of Medicine study found key areas in the 
brain suffer reduced activity and leave it physically altered.

The findings fuelled the debate over the impact violent games have on regular players and links to anti-social behaviour.

They
also came as a British teacher said children as young as four were 
hitting classmates as they re-enact scenes from violent 18-rated 
computer games.

Alison Sherratt, a reception class 
teacher at Riddlesden St Mary's Church of England Primary in Keighley, 
West Yorkshire, outlined her concerns at the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers conference earlier this year.

She
claimed youngsters were struggling to separate reality from their 
experiences in the virtual world and copied the scenes at school.

She
said pupils regularly discussed playing games such as the Call Of Duty 
series, set in various war zones, and Grand Theft Auto – where players 
carry out robberies, muggings, killings, drug deals and beat up 
prostitutes.

Her
warning came after news that 14-year-old Daniel Bartlam killed his 
mother with a claw hammer after watching a wide range of violent video 
games, films and TV storylines.

'Major corporations, including the video game 
industry, make billions on marketing and selling violent content to 
children,' he said in a statement. 'They have a responsibility to protect our children. If they do
not, you can count on the Congress to take a more aggressive role.'

The National Rifle Association also said the 'callous, corrupt' video game industry was to blame for the Sandy Hook killings, referring to games like Grand Theft Auto and 
Mortal Kombat.

In Southington, the event has been organised by SouthingtonSOS, which stands for 
Southington Offers Service and which is comprised of town, school and emergency 
officials as well as local business owners.

They will be holding the return event from 9am to noon at the Southington Drive-In on January 12.

'If we have one violent video game 
returned, we're going to be applauding,' Dr. Joseph Erardi, 
Southington's school superintendent added at a press conference.

'This isn't about quantity. It's 
about making a difference, one student, one parent, one family, one 
community at a time.'

The violent games, CDs and films handed in will be collected for 'appropriate permanent disposal'.

Members
of the group said they do not intend to suggest video games caused the 
shooting, but said 'there is ample evidence that violent video games, 
along with violent 
media of all kinds... has contributed to
increasing aggressiveness, fear, anxiety and is desensitizing our 
children to acts of violence including bullying'.

And even video game lovers have said that the violence has gone too far.

At
last year's E3 – the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the industry's 
largest U.S. gathering – some attendees were stunned by the intensity of
violence on display.

Mohamed Merah's (right) wife said he also played the game before

'The ultraviolence has to stop,' designer Warren Spector told the GamesIndustry website after the event.

'I
do believe that we are fetishizing violence, and now in some cases 
actually combining it with an adolescent approach to sexuality. I just 
think it's in bad taste. Ultimately I think it will cause us trouble.'

'The violence of these games can be off-putting,' Brian Crecente, news editor for the gaming website Polygon, agreed.

But he said, like movies and TV, the video-game industry is under pressure to keep the blood and gore because violent games sell well.

Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, where gunman James Holmes killed 12 people in a screening of the latest Batman film in July, said such realistic games may tip the mentally ill over the edge.

'There might well be some direct connection between people who have some mental instability and when they go over the edge – they transport themselves, they become part of one of those video games,' he said.

In response to criticisms, Hal Halpin, president of the nonprofit Entertainment Consumers Association, said: 'I'd simply and respectfully point to the lack of evidence to support any causal link.'
