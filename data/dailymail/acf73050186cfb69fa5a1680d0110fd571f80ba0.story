A Detroit woman charged with child abuse after the bodies of two of her children were found in her home freezer was ordered to stay in jail Thursday, unless she can post a $1 million bond.

Mitchelle Blair, 35, appeared in court via video feed from police lockup for her arraignment today and entered a plea of not guilty.

In setting the high bond, 36th District Court Magistrate Renee McDuffee said 'the charges in this matter are so heinous', while the prosecution said Blair could face two counts of first-degree murders once an autopsy determines how they died.

The children, Stoni Ann Blair and Stephen Gage Berry died, are believed to have been 13 and 9, respectively, when they died.

Investigators suspect the children died up to two years ago.

Held: Mitchelle Blair, 35, appears via video link from police lockup Thursday for her arraignment. She entered a plea of not guilty for charges of child abuse after the bodies of two of her children were found in her freezer

Mother: Mitchelle Blair, seen here in a photo from her Facebook, has been charged with five counts of child abuse. The bodies of two of her children were allegedly found in her chest freezer on Tuesday

Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Police sources allege Blair killed the girl a year ago and put her body in the freezer

Scene: Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, and her son, Stephen Gage Berry

Investigation: Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Police are seen at the low-income apartment complex near downtown Detroit on Tuesday

Police sources told The Detroit News earlier this week that Blair confessed to killing the two, after reportedly discovering they had been molesting a younger relative.

Blair allegedly killed her son two years ago and then her daughter in 2014 after learning of the abuse.

According to WXYZ, she strangled her son and tortured her daughter. 

She has been ordered not to have any contact with her two surviving children - a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy - who have been placed in protective custody.

Blair and the children were living in a nearby apartment when an eviction crew arrived her apartment on Tuesday near downtown Detroit.

It was then officers discovered the bodies buried deep in the chest freezer by the front door, according to reports. 

The children's bodies were still thawing Thursday and the medical examiner was planning to conduct the autopsies on them Friday.

Blair faces an April 2 probable cause hearing and April 9 preliminary examination.  

So far she  has been charged with five counts of first-degree child abuse, one of which could land her in prison for life, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutor's office. 

Neighbors said they hadn't seen the dead children in about a year. 

None of the four children was enrolled in Detroit schools, and friends said their mother was home-schooling them.

Under state law, Michigan parents have the right to homeschool their children.   

The state was not notified that Blair's children were being homeschooled this year, but such registration is voluntary.

Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. 

She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. 

Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. 

Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex.

Despite her money and other problems, friends call her a good mother. 

Blair is known throughout the complex of low-income townhomes as 'Angel'. 

But neighbors rarely saw the four children outdoors.  

In announcing the charges against Blair, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said 'the alleged facts in this case present examples of why we must all be diligent and involved citizens.'

Bailiffs first found the girl's body in the chest freezer while entering the apartment to serve the eviction. 

They then called police, who discovering the boy's body. 

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News.  

Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. 

On January 30, the posted a photo with the message: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' 

Blair filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support.

She then filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result.

Her brother Marlon Blair told the Detroit News earlier this week: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments.

'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.'

Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told the Detroit News: 'This is a terrible situation.'

No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched.

Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'.

There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official.  

Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house.
