Two young men died after they were involved in a car crash Friday night in Sylmar, California.

KTLA reported the victims, 19-year-old Isaiah Hastings and 18-year-old Alexander Manu, played football for College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita.

Their teammate, Elridge Salguero, was driving the two-seater Nissan the two victims were inside at the time of the crash, the affiliate station reported. Salguero, 18, survived and was taken to a hospital.

Wreck: The three players were reportedly inside this black Nissan

The Nissan slammed into a van and its occupants,  a 11-year-old girl and her mother Suh Min Kyung, were hospitalized, according to KTLA.

Witness Ginny Taylor told the affiliate station, 'I was on my way home, and just following the car in front of me, and I heard the crash, the hit of the two cars. So I looked up instead of, you know, directly at the car, slammed on my brake.

'She was braking. Saw some black things flying above her car, and then the car in front of hers… spun around, hit her again in the front… and spun some more, and ended up on the sidewalk or the dirt there.'

In a statement obtained by KTLA, College of the Canyons football coach Ted Iacenda said 'We're just devastated. Our team came together in a unique way over the summer, and the loss of Isaiah and Alexander leaves a void that I can’t begin to describe. We’re grieving for their families, and staying positive for Eldridge.'
