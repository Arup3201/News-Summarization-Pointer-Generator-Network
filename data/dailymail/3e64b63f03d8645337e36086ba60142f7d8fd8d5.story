The owners of a town pub in Cornwall got more than they bargained for after a sign to tempt in punters during a month of roadworks gave their pub a rude makeover.

Georgie Robinson, landlady of the Wig and Pen in Truro, innocently sent off for a sign after 10ft tall white boards appeared in front of her pub. It was supposed to say 'The Wig & Pen is open for business.'

But their solution took an unexpected turn after a printing error left the sign saying 'The Wig & Penis open for business' instead - much to the amusement of the regulars.

Blooper: The sign left punters smirking after a missing space morphed the Wig and Pen pub into the Wig and Penis

Although the missing space - and its unintentional consequences - were noticed from the start, pub staff were so anxious to show they were still open that they put it up straight away.

Speaking to MailOnline, Mrs Robinson, who runs the pub with her husband, said: 'It looked like the pub was not even there anymore - so
 we got a sign done to let people know we hadn't closed.

'The first sign had to go back - and then the second one had this slight error. But we thought "Sod it, we can't wait any longer." And it was quite funny - at least it caught people's attention!'

Open for business: The pub in Truro, Cornwall, ordered in the sign huge white boards were erected outside

Local following: Regulars at the drinking establishments have made the sign, now reinstated, a running joke

While the sign was up it became a 'running joke' with regulars at the pub, which prides itself on home-cooking all its food. pub regulars, and a photo of the blooper posted online attracted huge attention.

And even though the boards have now come down and the pub's usual signs can be seen, the lewd alternative has gained a following of its own and now hangs on the pub's railings.

'It became a bit of a running joke in the
 pub with the regulars. They're loving it. I hope some more people will 
come in as a result. We've put it back up outside.'
