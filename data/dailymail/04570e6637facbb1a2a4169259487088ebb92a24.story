Happier: Cile Precetaj, pictured, learned late Tuesday that her case is being reviewed and she can remain in her Detroit home pending the outcome

An illegal immigrant from Albania with three American-born children who was to be deported Tuesday has been granted a reprieve, gaining at least one more year in America.Cile Precetaj, 41, has also had her ankle tether removed, much to her relief and that of her children, who were bothered by the government ordered device.

Precetaj received a call from authorities Friday afternoon telling her to report to the immigration office in Detroit for the removal of her tether. While there, she was given a letter which informed her that her stay of removal request had been granted for one year.

'Now I can [chaperone] my sonâ€™s field trip to Ohio,' Precetaj told the Detroit Free Press.The Free Press notes that when Precetaj's one year is up, her lawyer will file another stay of removal request, which likely be granted as long as she complies with the law.'I am very happy. This is good news. All I want is to stay here and raise my kids and have a normal life,' she said.

Precetaj was told to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday but defied the order, choosing instead to stay home and wait for U.S. Immigrations Customs and Enforcement agents to come to her.

But they never did, as late on Tuesday she learned her case was being reviewed.

'I was just hugging my kids, saying "thank you, thank you, thank you." I don't have to be scared,' Precetaj told the Detroit Free Press after hearing the news.

Relief: Albanian immigrant Cile Precetaj and her family are celebrating her stay of removal order that came through yesterday

She said she was hopeful the authorities will allow her to stay in the U.S. permanently and 'raise my kids in this beautiful country.'

'I feel so glad, and I appreciate what they do for me right now,' she told FREEP. 'Hopefully, it's going to work for me and they're going to keep me here.'

Precetaj came to the U.S. illegally through Canada 13 years ago fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She also had an abusive fiance.

She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum. While in the U.S. illegally, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved to the U.S. 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, Mikey, 11, Migena, six and Martina, four, all U.S. citizens.

In a statement late Tuesday, ICE confirmed the hard-working mother, who has no criminal convictions, would have her case reviewed.

'ICE is presently conducting a review of Ms Precetaj's case, therefore her removal is not imminent at this time,' agency spokesman Khaalid Walls told FREEP.

Tears: Precetaj, pictured with her three U.S.-born children Mikey, 11, right, Migena, 6, center, and Martina, 4, left, was told Monday that she had to leave

Gojcevic said he hoped the government gives his wife another chance.

'Hopefully, they'll have a change of heart,' Gojcevic told FREEP. 'I hope they find it in their hearts not to split up a family.'

The review comes after Precetaj's heartbreaking case made national headlines Tuesday and prompted an outpouring of support.

Gojcevic said the whole ordeal has had a devastating impact on the couple's three children.

'The girls want to know why they're not going to school. They're on pins and needles,' Gojcevic said.

Devastating: Cile Precetaj, pictured right, who came to the States seeking asylum 13 years ago, was ordered to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday for a flight back to her native Albania

'There is a level of insanity in this
case,' Precetaj's attorney Andrew Johnson told 
MailOnline earlier on Tuesday as he fought to keep Precetaj with her 
husband and children. 'Someone is not doing what is ordinarily done. 
There is an abuse of power.'

Precetaj
is the sole carer of her elderly mother-in-law, another U.S. citizen, 
whose toes were amputated and needs help eating, walking and washing.

But
her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her 
testimony about fearing the prostitution trade and criminal activity in Albania lacked credibility. He 
said even if her concerns were warranted 'young, attractive women are 
not a social group for asylum.'

Packing up: Precetaj, pictured center with her kids, chose not to go to the airport and remained at home with her packed bags, waiting for authorities but they didn't come

Seeking asylum: Precetaj came to the U.S. through Canada in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum

After losing her appeal in 2008, she was given a deportation order.

An estimated 500,000 people are 
living in the U.S. with a deportation order, however, U.S. Immigrations 
Customs and Enforcement only acts on a portion of cases and the Obama 
Administration specifically said targeting people with criminal 
convictions was the priority.

Precetaj
has none. In fact, she's a glowing member of her community, described 
by friends and her children's teachers as a hard-working mother who pays
her taxes and helps her kids with schoolwork, not to mention keeping 
her elderly mother-in-law out of a government-funded home.

'Detroit
has gone off the map here,' Johnson said before the case review was announced. 'They are doing something 
that has not been done around the country. This person probably has as 
many positive evaluations as you can, she has three children who are 
U.S. citizens and has been here for a long time. I'm just baffled.'

Settled in: While here, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, including Martina, 4, pictured

Precetaj
became concerned about two weeks ago, when at her regular six-month 
check in with the deportation department she was fitted with a GPS ankle
bracelet. But the mother-of-three was convinced ICE wouldn't deport a 
woman whose three kids are American-born.

'That is strange they put an ankle 
bracelet on a mom with three kids,' Johnson said, referring to the low 
risk of her fleeing. 'Then the day before her scheduled flight they said
"You're flying out tomorrow, here's your information." They didn't want
the bad press.

'I
think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they 
understood how egregious this case is. It just doesn't make sense.'

If officials did not decide to review her case, the authorities would have been forced to collect Precetaj from her home yesterday and take her into custody. At midday Tuesday, she was pictured in her living room, with her family surrounding her awaiting ICE officers.

Precetaj
and her children were crying as they hugged by the Christmas tree, and 
the woman's mother-in-law was asking what would become of her if her 
daughter was sent home. Other relatives, including a cousin, were 
visibly upset at the heartbreaking situation the family has been thrown 
into.

Hugs: Precetaj has not decided, if she is in fact deported, whether to take the kids, who have never been to Albania, with her

Review: The mother's case will be reviewed

'They will jail 
her for one to three weeks, however long it takes to organize another 
flight,' Johnson told MailOnline of the process. 'Then border guards will drive her to 
the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she's a mass murderer 
or a terrorist going to Guantanamo.'

Johnson and the family were working desperately for someone in Washington D.C. to interject.

'We need somebody in the White House, connected to ICE, to say "stop this immediately. This is wrong." If someone in DC hears about this, that is our best chance. Her story just hasn't been heard.'

Understandably, Precetaj was beside herself, and was still trying to work out if she would take her children, who are enrolled in school and have never been to Albania, with her. Her husband works as a cook at restaurant in Detroit and said he can't afford to raise the children on his own.

'She is an emotional mess,' Johnson explained.

Deportation: Precetaj was informed Monday that she had to report at Deport's McNamara terminal at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday as per the above order

Empty: But the terminal, pictured, was empty at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, as the mother-of-three defied the order by staying home

'What she has been told by numerous people was that they don't deport women with three US citizen children and that is exactly what they're doing.

'She is crying all the time, trying to work out who she can take and who she can't. She's going back to Albania and that is not a good place to bring a 6-year-old girl, particularly.'

He added: 'It happened in one day, she has no idea what to do.'

Gojcevic told the Detroit Free Press Monday night the family was 'hoping for a miracle.'

'The basis of this request is that Ms. Precetaj would like to remain in the United States to care for her three children. After weighing the factors as related to Prosecutorial Discretion, I have determined that the stay of removal will be granted for a period of one year,' read the letter Precetaj received yesterday from the U.S. Immigration and Customs office.
