These tiny wooden versions of Britain's best-known gay celebrities have been created by campaigners in protest of the treatment of gay people in Russia.

The Russian dolls which depict Elton John, Stephen Fry, George Michael, Graham Norton and Tom Daley are hand-crafted by Paul Baker and staff at 3D studios in London.

The dolls' creators had originally planned to make a tiny version of the Russian President Vladimir Putin into the smallest doll and send the dolls to make a political point to the Kremlin in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in London.

But when Tom Daley announced he was dating a man earlier this month, gay rights campaigners The Kaleidoscope Trust and Mother creative agency decided to ditch Putin, known for parading around topless on horseback, for the the semi-naked diver.

The campaigners say they are happier to have included Daley over Putin, because the dolls are now a celebration of 'great British gays'.

A Mother spokesperson said: 'We wanted to feature Great British gays, icons we're all proud of. We were originally going to use Putin as the little doll but when Tom came-out we decided we wanted to make the dolls a beautiful collectable in their own right.

'Having Putin in there originally seemed a good idea, but actually he has nothing to do with pride. Each of the people in there are beacons of British gay pride, and we wanted to celebrate them.'

There are only a limited number of the special edition Russian dolls being made. One set is being sent to the Kremlin and one was attempted to be delivered to the Russian Embassy in London in protest of the treatment of gay people in Russia

The rest of the dolls are being auctioned off for charity. Elton John was so impressed with the dolls he has agreed to personally sign every single set made

Mother and The Kaleidoscope Trust now plan to make a collection of great British lesbians, as well as great British gay athletes in time for the Winter Olympics in Russia.

The lesbians to be included are not finalised yet, but the designers are looking to include broadcaster Clare Balding alongside Mary Portas, Sue Perkins, Sandi Toksvig and Jeanette Winterson,

The finished product is already on sale by online auction. The first set sold for over Â£2,000 with funds going to the Kaleidoscope Trust

The spokesman added: 'We then intend to make Great British Lesbians, and famous gay sports persons in time for the Winter Games in Russia.

'The first two sets, signed by Sir Elton, have gone for over Â£2,000. Over the weekend we're auctioning some signed by Stephen and the final set by Elton, then we'll finish with one set signed by Stephen, Elton and Graham (there's seven in total). They've given so much support to the project, we're chuffed.

Special delivery: Alistair Stewart and Chris Price from the Kaleidoscope Trust try to deliver dolls

'The team tried to deliver them to the 
Russian Embassy to send to the Kremlin as an act of solidarity with the 
Russian gay community.

'The gay community in Russia is facing increasingly draconian treatment at the hands of the authorities, so the more we can help the Kaleidosdope Trust with their work there, the better.'

Alistair Stewart from the Kaleidoscope Trust tried to deliver the dolls to the Russian Embassy, but they were not allowed in: 'The British coppers were very friendly and helped us find our way to the second gate. Sadly the Russian official at the gate refused to accept the gift, or let us take it inside. We showed him the dolls but he wasn't keen. The gay community in Russia is currently facing the most punitive treatment at the hands of the authorities. This was our way to show our pride and stand shoulder to shoulder with the LGBT communtiy in Russia.'

The dolls are being auctioned online at www.torussiawithlove.co.uk between December 13-22 to raise money for The Kaleidoscope Trust and their work with the Russian gay community.
