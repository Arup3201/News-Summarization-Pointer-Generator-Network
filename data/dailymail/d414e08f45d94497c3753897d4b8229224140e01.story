A grandfather choked to death in his hospital bed on a meal he should never have been given to eat. 

Roddy MacDonald died after staff served him the wrong meal.

The 84-year-old had Parkinson’s Disease, making it difficult for him to chew or swallow.

All his meals needed to be mashed and soft to prevent him choking but he was given a plate of beef goulash.

The pensioner, who had been due to go home from Glasgow’s Gartnavel Hospital after recovering from a urine infection, tried to eat the dinner and choked.

A doctor reportedly broke some of his ribs trying to resuscitate him but Mr MacDonald, a war veteran, could not be saved. 

His death certificate gave the main cause of death as ‘choked on food’.

Yesterday his family, who have just received £20,000 in compensation for his death in 2011, spoke out.

His son, Craig MacDonald, said: ‘My dad was a proud man who served in the army during the war. He had many good years ahead of him and it's such a shame his life ended the way it did.

‘It would have been easier to take if he had died of a heart attack but to think he was killed by the neglect of the people who were supposed to be caring for him is hard to take.’

Mr MacDonald’s family printed out a laminated diet sheet with his food requirements on it to prevent any mistakes from happening.

His Parkinson’s put him at severe risk of choking by weakening the muscles in his jaw and face, making it harder for him to chew and swallow.

He was put on a ‘pre-mashed’ diet, meaning food should be soft, tender and moist with little chewing required.

Relatives said they first complained to nurses when he was instead served ‘fork-mashable’ food, which needs more chewing than was safe.

His daughter-in-law, healthcare assistant Elizabeth MacDonald, said: ‘We found out the diet sheet we had made for Roddy had been lost, along with his notes, and turned up in a drawer.

‘Feeding someone the right food should be one of the most basic things to get right in hospital. It should never ever have happened.

‘When he was given the beef goulash, we don’t know how long he was choking for.

‘A doctor tried to resuscitate him and we later found out broke a few of his ribs. They put him on a breathing machine and he died the same day.’

The pensioner had been in hospital for three weeks when he died, surrounded by his wife, son and daughter-in-law.

A report from an expert witness found, the family said, that he was also given the wrong dosage of a Parkinson’s drug.

He lost 10 per cent of his body weight in hospital but was not referred to a dietitian.

They also say he was given an adult pad, even though he was not incontinent, because staff would not take him to the toilet.

Mr MacDonald’s death was reported to the Procurator Fiscal and his family launched a claim for compensation, which was settled for £20,000.

A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which runs Gartnavel, said: ‘This is a tragic case and our sympathies remain with the family.

Craig McDonald said of his father: 'My dad was a proud man who served in the army during the war. He had many good years ahead of him and it's such a shame his life ended the way it did'

‘We accept that there were failings in the care of Mr MacDonald. These were highlighted during our own Significant Incident Review process and a range of lessons were learned and improvements put in place.’

Since the tragedy the health board has improved labelling of texture-modified meals on patient menus and help for people eating them.

But his son Craig is demanding an apology from the health board. He said: ‘The way my father was being treated was horrendous.

‘Staff were given a diet sheet with instructions because of his Parkinson's but gave him goulash and he choked to death.

‘He was a great dad and brilliant granddad - my kids adored him - and they killed him. I will never forgive them for that.’
