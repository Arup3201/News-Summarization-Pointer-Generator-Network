This is the moment two cruel thieves were caught on CCTV stealing a four-year-old girl's pet rabbit from outside her home.

Max, a three-year-old male English white rabbit, was still in his hutch when he was taken from the secluded property in Thorne, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of the morning.

The treasured pet belonged to Elsa Fowles and her siblings who have been left very upset.

Wanted: The family have posted the footage online in a bid to try and have the culprits tracked down

Her mother Sandra, 41, said Elsa and her brothers and sisters including Jodie, 16, Callum, 
14, Cameron, six, and two-year-old Heidi had been looking after Max since he was seven-weeks-old.

The theft was captured on security cameras which her husband Ashley, an electrician, had set up on a wall of their property.

It shows a car driving past at around 1am, before two young men appear wearing dark jackets and trainers.

After removing cycling bins from on top of Max's hutch, they then pick up the rabbit's home and carry it away.

The family have passed the footage to South Yorkshire Police and have also shared the footage online in a bid to catch the culprits.

Mrs Fowles, an accountant, said she believes the deliberate targeting of Max implies it was a targeted theft to order.

She said: 'We’ve had Max since he was seven weeks old and he’s part of the family.

'It’s a big double hutch and needs two men to carry it, so this was no chance theft – it must have been planned.'

Max had been kept outside the front 
door because the couple keep their pet dogs, Rottweiler Lemmy and Great 
Dane Lexy, in the back garden.

Mrs Fowles said: 'When I went out at 8am to put rubbish in the recycling bins I was hysterical after realising Max had been stolen.

'The thieves has stacked the recycling bins neatly and had left our guinea pigs and their hutch, so they were plainly targeting Max.'

To ensure the guinea pigs did not get stolen should the thieves return Mrs Fowles put them in the playhouse in the back garden, but unfortunately the dogs attacked and killed them, which has further upset the children.

Mrs Fowles said: 'Because of these horrible men my children have lost all the furry pets now.

'Someone must know where Max is. Some child went to bed on Thursday night and woke in the morning to find they had a rabbit and hutch.

'We just want Max returned safe and sound.'

The theft happened at around 1am on Friday, August 16.
