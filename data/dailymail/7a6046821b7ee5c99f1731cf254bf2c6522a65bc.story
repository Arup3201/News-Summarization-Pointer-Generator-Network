Next time someone wearing Google Glass winks in your direction, they might not be flirting with you - instead they could be taking a photo.

In the latest software update for the wearable technology, users can now take photos by winking in the direction of the object they want to photograph.

The device’s built-in camera registers the movement of the eye to take the shot and to make sure this movement isn’t mistaken for a blink, the wink will need to be exaggerated to register.

As part of the December software update, Google Glass wearers can now take photos by winking.

The device’s built-in screen and camera registers the movement of the eye to take the shot.

To make sure it’s not mistaken for a blink, the wink will need to be exaggerated to register.

Google announced the feature could one day be used to pay for goods or to wink at pages in a recipe book, to make the instructions appear on the screen.

Other updates include uploading YouTube videos straight from the gadget.

Users can now see Hangout conversations on the screen and +Google Music Play subscribers will be able to control playlists through Google Glass.

There is also a lock screen to prevent people from accessing the device without permission.

Google announced that the iOS app is ready but won’t be available until a later software update. 

Google added that the feature could one day also be used to pay for goods, or to wink at pages in a recipe book and make the instructions appear on the screen.

As Google explained in a blog post announcing the update: ‘Glass is about helping you look up and experience the world around you without getting bogged down by technology.

'Based on this philosophy, we've got a new setting that lets you quickly and easily capture the moments you care about with a simple wink of the eye.’

The firm added that the feature is not turned on by default and instead wearers need to enable it in the Settings menu.

In April, a Reddit user found coding hidden inside the MyGlass companion app that hinted that the feature was coming.

The commands he found included ‘WINK_ENABLED, WINK_CALIBRATION_SUCCESS, and EYE_GESTURES_WINK_TAKE_PHOTO.‘

Other new features in the December software update include the option to upload YouTube videos straight from the gadget by tapping on the video, or swiping to the YouTube share card.

Google has also added the ‘ok glass, share with YouTube’ voice command.

Elsewhere, users will soon be able to see Hangout conversations on the screen and +Google Music Play subscribers will be able to control playlists through Google Glass.

There is also a new lock screen – 
similar to those found on Android phones and tablets - to prevent people
 from accessing the device without permission.

Despite all these changes, Google is yet to announce when the device will go on general sale, although rumours are still hinting at a mid-2014 release. 

Currently, only Google Glass Explorers can buy the technology for $1,500 (£915) and all the firm is saying is that it’s ‘expanding The Explorer Program little by little, and experimenting with different ways of bringing new Explorers into the program.’

The update has also been met with anger among some privacy campaigners who are already concerned with how the device is used in public.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'Google Glass already faces a minefield of privacy issues and this aspect is just another reminder of how it will potentially undermine our ability to control what information is held about us and by who.

'The absence of any substantial audible or visual instruction makes it much harder for people to understand their image is being captured and exercise their right to object, while doing nothing to address the reasonable questions about how legal requirements for people to consent to data being captured will be met.

'Early camera phones needed a shutter sound to alert people to the fact the camera was being used after a series of incidents that intruded on people’s privacy. Google Glass has yet to reassure people in the same way that it will not be a snoopers favourite gadget.'

Google co-founder Sergey Brin has previously said that the company takes privacy seriously and Glass lights up when taking photos or recording video so other people can see that it is on.
