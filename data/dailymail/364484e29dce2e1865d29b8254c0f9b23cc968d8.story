A devastated couple are begging to have their daughter's life ended because they can no longer bear to see her suffering from an incurable and painful cancer.

Zhao Zihan, from north-western China's Shaanxi Province, was diagnosed two years ago with retinoblastoma

This is a rapidly developing cancer that forms in the retina of the eye.

Last year, she had her left eyeball removed in an operation, but the cancer cells continued to spread and a massive, malignant tumour began growing on her cheek.

Heartbroken parents Zhao Lipeng, 27 and his wife Lili, 25, are searching for a hospital that will let their daughter Zhao Zihan, four, die in peace. She was diagnosed with a terminal eye cancer two years ago

Zhao Zihan had surgery to remove a tumour from her left eyeball last year, but the cancer continued to spread. Now she has a large, malignant growth on her cheek (pictured) which leaves her in agony

Zhao Zihan as a baby. Her parents have taken her to numerous  hospitals  to see different specialists but, despite sugery, her cancer is incurable. 'We can't bear to see her like this any more,' her father said

Despite numerous consultations, hospital visits and painful medical treatment including removing her eye, doctors said her cancer was incurable.

Now her parents say they can no longer bear to see her in pain.

Her father Zhao Lipeng, 27, told QNews: 'We hope to find a hospital that will admit our child and help lessen her pain so that she can leave this world peacefully,' he said.

'We can't bear to see her like this any more.

'She is suffering all the time. We have taken her to every hospital and every specialist that we could, and everyone has told us it incurable.

'There is no hope.'

They have taken their daughter to hospitals including Beijing's Tongren Hospital, which specialises in ophthalmology.

Retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina - is a rare type of eye cancer which usually affects children younger than five.

The disease causes the retina cells to grow quickly and out-of-control.

While treating it usually involves laser treatment, freezing the tumour or heat therapy,.

Larger tumours can require chemotherapy, or surgery to remove the eye.

Some of the symptoms include:

* A white eye or white reflection which can be seen in a photograph

* A squint

* A red sore or swollen eye

* A change in colour to the iris

* Deterioration in vision

It was there that doctors confirmed her condition was incurable and would be terminal.

Retinoblastoma – cancer of the retina – causes the cells of the retina to grow rapidly and out of control.

It is the most common reason for eye tumours found in children, and the number of cases seen in Asia has grown since 1987.

If the cancer has spread beyond the eye, as in Zhao Zihan's case, it has the potential to spread around the body and is difficult to treat.

Survival is dependent on early diagnosis - and for Zhao Zihan, the diagnosis came too late. 

Her father says although it will break his heart to see her die, he cannot watch his daughter suffer any longer.

Euthanasia is illegal under current Chinese law, although recent surveys have shown a majority of people have a tolerant attitude towards the practice, the Shanghaiist reports.

'We want her to leave this life peacefully, not in agony,' her mother said.

Zhao Zihan, with her mother, is left in pain by the huge tumour on her cheek. Her parents say they hope to find a hospital that will admit her and help lessen her pain so that she can die peacefully
