A Michigan public safety officer went above and beyond the call of duty during his patrol when he pulled a vehicle over for a traffic violation, officials say.

Emmett Township Public Safety Officer Ben Hall made contact with the car's driver, Lexi DeLorenzo, and instead of giving the woman a ticket, he gave her something else -- a car seat.

Hall noticed a small child in the back seat wearing a seat belt but not sitting in a car seat.

DeLorenzo told the officer that although she knows the importance of having her daughter in a car seat, she couldn't afford to buy one due to limited income at the time, Fox 17 reports.

So Hall instructed the young mom to pull in to a nearby Walmart in Battle Creek where he bought her a new car seat for her daughter, according to KTLA 5.

DeLorenzo took to Facebook to express her gratitude for the officer's good deed. 

In a post, the mother-of-two explained that she recently hit a financial struggle and lost her vehicle as well as her children's car seats.

'[Hall is] an amazing man,' DeLorenzo wrote 'and I will never forget the kindness and compassion you showed me, and you also showed my daughter and myself that there are people out there that care. Thank you!'

Hall also received kudos from his colleagues on the Emmett Township Department of Public Safety's Facebook page.

In a post describing the incident, the Department stated 'special pat on the back to Public Safety Officer Ben Hall...nice job Officer Hall!'
