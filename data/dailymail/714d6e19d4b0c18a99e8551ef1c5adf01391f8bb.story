An airline passenger who became upset after a woman reclined the seat in front of him, causing the pilot to divert the plane, has been indicted on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew.

Edmond Alexandre, 60, began to argue with other passengers over the reclined seat on the August 27 flight from Miami to Paris, the U.S. attorney's office said. 

But when a crew member intervened, Alexandre followed him down the aisle and grabbed his arm.

Squashed: Edmond Alexandre, not pictured here, became angry after a woman reclined the seat in front of him

Alexandre 60, had to be subdued by two undercover federal air marshals after an outburst 

Two undercover federal air marshals stepped in to subdue the passenger and the American Airlines flight was diverted to Boston.

His lawyer, Josh Hanye, said  that the 60-year-old has serious health conditions including diabetes, which was not being properly treated at the time.

'I think all that matters in what happened on the plane,' Hanye said.

Alexandre, a  Haitian national who lives in Paris, was indicted Thursday.

However his outburst over the reclined seat was the second such incident in the U.S. that week, authorities said.

Days earlier, a United Airlines flight diverted to Chicago after two passengers argued over reclining a seat.
