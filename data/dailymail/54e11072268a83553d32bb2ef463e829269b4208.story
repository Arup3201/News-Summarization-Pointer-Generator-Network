An elderly man who fleeced a bank out of $20 million by doctoring a $20 cheque has been handed a four year jail sentence.

Grahame Bell, 65, pleaded guilty on Thursday to defrauding the National Australia Bank when he dishonestly dealt with a cheque he received from the bank in April 2012.

Bell got his hands on the cheque by deliberately overpaying an account set up in a fake name, before closing the account and altering the refund cheque to read $20 million, the Advertiser reports.

He sent the cheque to NAB bank with a letter saying the money was for electrical works in a mining project, a South Australian court heard.

While the money was initially cleared by the bank, an 'observant' staff member picked up the error and the cheque was revered just a few hours later.

'Whilst at first glance it may have appeared the intended offence was so fabulous it was doomed to failure, in fact, had it not been for the observant steps taken by the drawer of the original cheque for $20 the fraud may have been completed and you may have been able to access the funds in question,' Judge Rauf Soulio said.

Cheque fraud was famously carried out by Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can

Bell was arrested at a bus station when police seized his suitcase in August 2012.

He was found with a number of false cheques and false identities.

Bell was sentenced to three years and six months jail.
