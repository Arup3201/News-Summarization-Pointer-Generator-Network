One of the most ornate pieces of hand-beaten copperwork ever to be made in Britain  is poised to add the finishing touch to a new lecture theatre in a huge £19million development at the exclusive Eton College.

The enormous  267lb roof ornament, which has taken eight months to make, will sit atop a gable outside the 300-seat hall at the prestigious £34,000-per-year school.

The elaborate feature, known as an acroterion, has been made by Michael Johnson and Shelley Anderson and is said to be the most complex example of copperwork made 'in a generation'.

The pair now have the challenging task of installing the six feet wide sculpture - which they said would cost between £50,000 and £70,000 to make - outside the school's new lecture hall.

Mr Johnson said it was one of the most intricate pieces of copper to be made in decades and that hand-crafted work of this sort has not been done since the Second World War.

He said: 'It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most complex and intricate pieces of hand-crafted architectural copper-work made in this country in a generation.' 

The two men, who run the Copper Works studio in Newlyn, Cornwall, were commissioned to make the roof decoration by architects working for Eton's new quadrangle-style development, Bekynton Field.

The £19m project - which has been worked on by the architect John Simpson, who also designed the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace - includes 40 new classrooms for modern languages, economics and politics, as well as the lecture theatre and exhibition space. 

It is the latest addition to the sprawling site in Windsor, Berkshire, which is best known for its Gothic-style college chapel that was part of the original design when it was founded in 1441.

The pair said there were a lot of engineering challenges to overcome in making the huge feature, including how it should be hung 

The pair had to design a strong but light stainless steel roof structure so the feature can be attached in the correct position

The new complex is said to have been designed to blend in with the historic environment and will feature conservation-grade brickwork as well as stonework features and brick arches.

Mr Johnson said: 'There were a lot of engineering challenges to overcome because it was an exercise in balancing the aesthetic and the practical. There were numerous considerations, such as ensuring it was able to expand and contract in the heat and also drain properly.

'Then there were issues with how it was to be fixed. Traditionally a piece like this would have been done over wood, but there was no provision in the roof structure to bolt it to the roof so we had to design and build a stainless steel armature which was relatively light and able to flex.

'With something as complex as this you have to design it with close consideration to how it will function. And all the planning has to be done before a single hammer is swung.' 

Acroterions are a hallmark of Britain's grandest buildings and can include discs, tripods and ornate Gothic statues. Only a handful are still made in the UK and very few are as large as the pair's creation.

A new £19million development is currently being built at Eton College (pictured) which will include the lecture theatre and 40 new classrooms 

One of the most well-known parts of the school includes the Eton College chapel, which was part of the original plan for the school when it was founded by King Henry VI in 1441

Acroterions are typically placed on a flat base called the acroter or plinth and mounted at the apex of the pediment of a building in the classical style. The names derives from the Greek words for extremity and endmost.

Mr Johnson told the Western Morning News they won the contract after being contact by the project's architects, Simpsons.

He said: 'They had searched the whole of the UK to find someone capable of producing something like this – and they initially drew a blank and went to France. 

'As a society, we acknowledge the historical importance of our buildings, but there remains a gap between that and the people needed to keep them going. 

'The sort of thing we have made for Eton stopped happening in Britain after the Second World War. Intricate hand-crafted copper-work doesn’t really get done in this country any more... well it didn’t until we started on the acroterion.' 

Although the pair would not say how much they are being paid, they said a project like that would cost between £50,000 and £70,000 to commission. 

The £19m Bekynton Field development - which has been worked on by architect John Simpson, who also designed the Queens Gallery at Buckingham Palace - includes 40 new classrooms for modern languages, economics and politics, as well as the lecture theatre and exhibition space.

The new complex is said to have been designed to blend in with the historic environment at the school in Windsor, Berkshire, and will feature conservation-grade brickwork as well as stonework features and brick arches. 

The school chapel, one of the most picturesque and well-known parts of the site, formed part of the original plan for the site when the school was founded by King Henry VI as free education to 70 Cambridge-bound boys in 1441. He intended the nave of the chapel - which was to include 18 bays - to be the longest in Europe.

But when Henry was deposed by King Edward IV in 1461, construction of the chapel stopped. It was then gradually put together during the remainder of the century. 

The important wall paintings in the Gothic-style chapel and some of the buildings in the school yard also date back to that time. The lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, was built between 1441 and 1460

The school then plunged into final difficulty meaning most of the building work was not resumed until Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517. His name is borne by the big gate-house in the cloisters at the front of the school yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school.

This range includes the parlour, election hall and election chamber, where most of the 18th century 'leaving portraits' are kept.

Nothing else of significance was built until about 1670, when the school yard was remodelled and completed by Matthew Bankes. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister in 1725, by Thomas Rowland.

In the 19th century, the architect John Shaw Jr became surveyor to Eton. He designed buildings in 1844 which were to be used as better accommodation.

The very large and ornate school hall and school library were erected by L.K Hall in 1906 as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War.

During the Second World War, a bomb destroyed part of Upper School and blew out many windows in the Chapel. The college commissioned replacements by Evie Hone, John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens from 1959.

In 1959, the school also constructed a nuclear bunker to house the College's Provost and fellows which is now used for storage.  

The completion of the Bekynton Field development will be followed by a series more development at the college, including the renovation of the boarding house, which will include 53 mostly en-suite study bedrooms.
