A young Russian woman has died after dropping her charging iPhone into the water while she was taking a bath.

Moscow resident Evgenia Sviridenko, 24, was found lifeless in the bath by her female housemate who had grown concerned about why she had been silent in the bathroom for so long.

Miss Sviridenko is understood to have been using the phone to look at her social media page on VKontakte - the Russian version of Facebook - when the accident occured. It has not yet been established why the charger didn't cut out as licensed Apple products are designed to do.

Speaking to local media from the apartment the two young women shared with Miss Sviridenko, Yaroslav Dubinina, 23, said: 'I noticed that she had been gone a while, and when I couldn't raise her I opened the door and saw her floating on the water looking really pale.'

'I saw her phone which was on the charger and at the bottom of the bath, and I unplugged it and pulled her out...Her body was still shaking from the shock,' she added.

Police are now investigating why the phone charger did not apparently cut out and refused to reveal whether it was a licensed Apple product or not.

Russian media said Miss Sviridenko's iPhone 4 had still been working despite falling into the water because an automatic update had been posted on her social media page saying she had called the emergency services telephone number.

Miss Dubinina said that her friend had recently arrived in Moscow from her home in Omsk and they had decided to share a flat together as neither of them could afford a flat on their own.

Miss Sviridenko's death comes just days after a 16-year-old Russian girl died after taking her charging iPhone into a shower.

A regional Investigative Committee spokesperson said initial tests had suggested the girl died from an electric shock but that the investigation was ongoing.

Again it is not known whether the charger used in the second incident in Russia's Bashkortostan Republic was a licensed Apple product or whether it was a  fake.

VKontakte, known as VK, is the largest Russian-language social network in Europe and is particularly popular in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine.

As of November 2014, VK had at least 280 million accounts and is the second most visited website in Russia, after the Google-style search engine Yandex.
