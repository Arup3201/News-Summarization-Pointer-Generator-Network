A body has been found in the search for a missing teenager who got into trouble in a river yesterday.

Jordan Roberts, 17, got into difficulties after entering the River Wear near Finchale Abbey, County Durham, at around 5pm.

After a huge search was launched to find him last night, police this morning confirmed they have found a body.

Relatives of Jordan were seen at the scene today and were taken down to the riverside by officers.

Undertakers, dressed in black suits, arrived at the scene this morning. The body is yet to be formally identified.

Superintendent Andy Huddleston, of Durham Constabulary, said: 'Jordan's family have been informed of the development and we are continuing to support them through this difficult time.'

Jordan was playing with three friends next to the river Wear when the alarm was raised shortly after 5pm. Three of the teenagers had entered the water and got into difficulty. 

One was pulled out and was given life saving CPR on the river bank before being taken to hospital, where his condition is described as poorly but stable.

Jordan, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, remained unaccounted for this morning and emergency teams were continuing the search for him after suspending the operation at 8.30pm last night.

A police helicopter, a search and rescue team and fire crews trained in water search were involved in the operation, as well as a police dog section and an underwater diving team. The area surrounding the scene had been cordoned off by police, including a number of roads.

A team of divers were brought in, as well as fire crews trained in water search and a police dog unit
