Three furry critters with a voracious sexual appetite have been discovered in Queenland.

The shaggy-haired marsupials have marathon mating sessions that are so vigorous they often prove fatal to the male.

Australian scientists discovered the new species, which are about the same size as a mouse and enjoys - or endures - a mating season that lasts for several weeks.

The black-tailed antichinus' sex sessions can last for to 14 hours at a time, with both the males and females romping from mate to mate

'It’s a very exciting time to be a mammalogist,' said Andrew Baker, head of the Queensland University of Technology team who made the discoveries.'Typically there’s only a couple of new species of mammals found worldwide each year. So to find three new species of this marsupial, all in South-East Queensland is really exciting,' he told The Guardian.

One of the creatures, named the black-tailed antechinus, has been found in the high-altitude, wet areas of far southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales.

Scientists from the University of Queensland explained about the die-off of Antechinus when the species was discovered last year.

It is presumed that the new black-tailed species behaves in a similar way.

Researchers had imaged that the males were altruistic and died so that there was more food for their offspring, but biologist Diana Fisher showed the animals were over-doing it to promote their own genes over their competitors’.

They try so hard to reproduce that their bodies shut down.

Researchers found the huge rush of stress hormones, which have enabled the animals to keep at it over a mating period of a few weeks, also causes their body tissues to ‘disintegrate’.

Their fur falls out, they stagger around, bleed internally and sometimes get painful gangrene infections as their immune system stops working - before dying.

Caribbean reef squid, Pacific salmon and plenty of arachnids also engage in semelparous, or 'big-bang reproduction'. But it is rare for mammals to employ such desperate mating tactics.

It is identifiable by a very shaggy, hairy coat with long guard hairs and an orangey-brown coloured rump, which ends with a black tail.

But its incredible sexual appetite and strenuous mating sessions are arguably its most noteworthy feature.

Sex sessions can last for to 14 hours at a time, with both the males and females romping from mate to mate.

‘It's frenetic, there's no courtship, the males will just grab the females and both will mate promiscuously,’ Dr Baker told Reuters.

The mating season lasts for several weeks and the males will typically die from their exertions.

Excessive stress hormones in the males that build up during the mating season degrade their body tissue, leading to death, whereas females have the ability to block the production of the hormone, according to the study, which was published in the journal Zootaxa.

Scientists discovered the carnivorous antechinus last year, which is closely related to the newly discovered black-tailed antechinus and also dies from its stressful and marathon mating sessions.

Dr Baker told ABC News that the black-tailed antechinus’ sex sessions ‘probably follow the typical pattern of antechinus, which is all males are dead before they turn one year old’.

The creatures typically have their frenzied mating period when they are around 11 months old and ‘all males will die before the young are born,’ he said.

The male Antechinus, which was discovered last year, die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time. They try so hard to reproduce that their bodies shut down

The black-tailed antechinus was found at the highest peak of the World-Heritage listed Gondwana Rainforests, in Springbrook National Park in Queensland, about 560 miles (900 km) north east of Sydney, but the researchers are unsure how many of the species exist.

Dr Baker said: 'It’s been trapped there, at the very highest point of the rainforest at 1,000 metres, where you get fog dripping onto the plants. With its big shaggy coat, it probably likes the coldest and wettest environment possible.

The rainforest habitat in which the strange animals live is dwindling and 'the animals who can’t fly or move very far become trapped and they become very different because they can no longer interbreed,' he added.

Dr Baker ad his team have applied for the black-tailed antechinus to be listed as an endangered species.
