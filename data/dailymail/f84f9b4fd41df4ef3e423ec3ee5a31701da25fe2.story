Former England wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter will see a number of eye specialists in the next few weeks as he waits to discover whether he can continue his professional cricket career.

The Johannesburg-born player suffered a fractured eye socket and cheekbone while batting for Somerset against Northamptonshire last July.

He returned for his county towards the end of the season but, while playing in his native South Africa in early winter, he realised his vision was still impaired.

Somerset director of cricket Matthew Maynard said: 'When he came back at the tail end of last season, Craig knew that his eye wasn't quite as good as it was prior to the injury.

'Then when he played in the Ram Slam T20 over in South Africa it became evident to Craig that the eye hadn't improved from where it was at the end of the season, so that's obviously a concern for him.'

The 27-year-old has already ruled out any realistic prospect of playing this summer, and should get a clearer idea of his long-term prospects courtesy of medical experts in Europe and the United States in the coming weeks.

'He will see an eye specialist in Belgium next week, as well as seeing a specialist in the USA,' Maynard added. 'That will hopefully give some indication as to what will happen going forward.

'Craig has got a lot of years left as a top player but it is important that he makes sure he gets his vision looked after, which is why he is seeing the best eye specialists in the world. Hopefully, that will give us a better understanding of the long-term prognosis.

'As a coach, I have had to plan that we won't see him for the summer. If the results from the specialists are positive and he feels that he is ready to resume his career before the end of the season then we would be delighted to have him back.

'Craig has to think quite selfishly at this stage about what's best for him. He loves playing cricket for Somerset and I am sure that he would love to continue doing so, but first and foremost he knows that his eye has got to be right.

'Obviously we all wish him the very best with the upcoming appointments with the specialists, and hopefully we'll have some good news for both Craig and Somerset County Cricket Club.'
