Rory McIlroy has announced he will play for Ireland rather than Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Golf makes its return to the Games in Rio for the first time since 1904 and McIlroy, who hails from Holywood in Northern Ireland, would be eligible to play for either team.

McIlroy has long faced a difficult and highly political decicion over his allegiance. He grew up playing golf for Ireland but admitted to Sportsmail in September 2012 - shortly after the London Olympics - that he has 'always felt more British than Irish.'

But the 25-year-old two-time major champion admitted he has already made his choice during a press conference ahead of this week's Irish Open at Fota Island.

'I see this as a continuation of what I have always done,'  said McIlroy, who has represented Ireland at golf's World Cup in the past but admitted the football World Cup in Brazil had influenced his decision. 

'The World Cup is on in Brazil and it sort of gets you thinking,' said the former world No 1 and current  No 6.

'I've been thinking about it for a while but in saying that, (there's) no time like the present - the Irish Open, something big is happening in Brazil - and I thought, “why not?”

'I just thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to let everyone know, and now I’m really looking forward to Rio.'

McIlroy faced a backlash from some corners following his interview with Sportsmail, in which he hinted he had made up his mind to play for Britain.

He said at the time: ‘Maybe it was the way I was brought up, I don’t know, but I have always felt more of a connection with the UK than with Ireland. And so I have to weigh that up against the fact that I’ve always played for Ireland and so it is tough. Whatever I do, I know my decision is going to upset some people but I just hope the vast majority will understand.’ 

But McIroy said on Wednesday that his sense of allegiance to the Golfing Union of Ireland, the amateur body which runs golf in Ireland, influenced his decision. 

'When I actually sat down and thought about it, had a little time to myself, it wasn’t because as a boy, as an amateur, my ambition was always to play for Ireland. Whether to play on the six-man team for the European Championships or the Home Internationals 11-man team, that was always my goal.

‘I played boy junior and boys golf for Ireland, I played my amateur golf for Ireland - just because I’m getting paid that doesn't mean I should change that.’

McIlroy, who recently split from his fiancee, Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, drew parallels with the Irish rugby team which draws players from the island of Ireland.

‘If you look at most of the other sports in this country - rugby being the main example - they see Ireland as one.

‘And I have a lot of friends who play for Ulster who would say they're Northern Irish but are very proud to pull on the green jersey, as I will be in a couple of years’ time.’

McIlroy also insisted the final decision was his.

‘I was always just worried about what other people would think when actually it's your decision at the end of the day and you have to take ownership of it and be comfortable with it.

McIlroy was born in Holywood, Northern Ireland, which means he is a UK citizen and so eligible for Team GB.

But McIlroy is also an Irish citizen and played amateur golf for Ireland on an all-island team, so he is also eligible to play for that nation at the Olympics.

‘That was the decision I was most comfortable with and the decision that I wanted to make.

‘I’m very happy with my decision and I’m looking forward now to the Olympics in a couple of years' time - if I qualify, obviously, for the team,’ he added with a grin.

Asked if he had been 'torn' on the issue, the former world No 1 added: 'More worried about what other people would think, rather than me. But you've got to do what's right for yourself and what you feel most comfortable with, and ultimately that was the decision that I made.'  

McIlroy's golf clubs arrived safely in time for today’s Pro-Am but their delay from the United States after the US Open meant he couldn’t play a round with JP McManus on Tuesday at the Old Head of Kinsale.
