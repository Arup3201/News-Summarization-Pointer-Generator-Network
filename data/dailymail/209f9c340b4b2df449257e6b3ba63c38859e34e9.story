John Cleese, who starred in the iconic series Fawlty Towers, has been named as the most influential British comic of all time.

The 75-year-old actor, part of the Monty Python group, beat legendary comics David Jason, Rowan Atkinson and Ronnie Barker to claim the accolade.

Jason, 74, who famously played Delboy Trotter in the cult series Only Fools and Horses, came second in the public poll, just ahead of Mr Bean and Blackadder star, Rowan Atkinson.

The late Ronnie Barker, known for his roll in British comedy shows such as Two Ronnies and Porridge, came fourth in the public poll. Ricky Gervais, who shot to fame through The Office, was named as the fifth most influential British comic. 

Dawn French, one half of the comedy duo French and Saunders and the star of The Vicar of Dibley, clinched the sixth spot, making her the highest-ranking woman the list. 

The late Rik Mayall, who was popular for his roles in The Young Ones and Bottom, came eighth.

Kenneth Williams, one of the main ensembles of the Carry On films, came ninth, while Steve Coogan, the actor behind Alan Partridge, completed the top ten.

Other stars included in the top 20 were Gavin and Stacey actor James Corden, sketch show comic Harry Enfield and Barker's comedy partner, Ronnie Corbett.

Miranda Hart, the star of her self-titled comedy series, stand-up comedian Eddie Izzard and Little Britain actor David Walliams also made the list.

Cleese's Monty Python colleague Michael Palin was put in 17th place, while Arthur Lowe from Dad's Army was 18th.

The final two were Jennifer Saunders, who as well as starring in French and Saunders created Absolutely Fabulous, and Father Ted's Dermot Morgan.

The study was commissioned by Gold to mark tomorrow's launch of Monty Python: The Meaning of Live.

Steve North, from Gold, said: 'John Cleese is known and loved by many people both old and young.

'So it may not come as a surprise that he's been named as the most influential comedy icon, above other greats such as Rowan Atkinson and David Jason.

'Shows like Monty Python and Fawlty Towers will be watched by the nation for years to come, and the recent Monty Python live show proves how successful and popular it really is.

'Even those who are no longer around, such as Ronnie Barker, are leaving their stamp on comedy.' 

During the poll, half of those questioned said modern comedians were not as funny as classic comedy actors.

Many described modern comedy as too crude, lacking in humour and full of bad language.

The twelve-episode sitcom Fawlty Towers was first broadcast on BBC2 in 1975.

The show was written by Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth, both of whom also starred in the show.

Monty Python's Flying Circus first aired on the BBC in 1969.

Forty-five episodes were made over four series, before the show moved from the television series into stage shows, films,  albums and books.

Cleese also recently performed his final Monty Python show along side his fellow actors, Eric Idle, 71, Terry Jones, 72, Terry Gilliam, 73 and Michael Palin, 71.
