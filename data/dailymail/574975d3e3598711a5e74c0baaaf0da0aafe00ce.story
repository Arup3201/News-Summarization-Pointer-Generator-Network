It was the photograph that made Helen Mirren’s hourglass figure the envy of women worldwide.

And now the Oscar-winning actress has revealed her secret to looking sensational in a red bikini in your 60s.

Dame Helen claims that the famous picture of her standing on a beach in Italy in 2008 was just a flattering angle.

The star, who turns 69 on Saturday, has confessed to being a ‘classic yo-yo dieter’. She has always fluctuated by 10lb and is currently ‘at the top end of those 10lb and I have got to get back to the bottom end’. But rather than hit the gym, she said that it takes her just 12 minutes of exercise a day to become fit.

She follows the Royal Canadian Air Force exercise plan, which was created by a doctor in the 1950s. It is a stretching and toning regime originally designed to keep the men and women of the force fit in a quick way without gym equipment.

The routine comprises five exercises for men and ten for women such as push-ups, sit-ups, running on the spot and arm circling, which work all the muscle groups.

There are targets to aim for, with more exercises at a harder level to be completed within the 12 minutes once strength starts to improve. Dame Helen said she returns to the plan whenever she feels her fitness slipping.

‘I’m not very fit at all actually,’ she told this week’s Hello! magazine. ‘Just this morning I started my exercises, which I haven’t been doing for months, maybe years. I do a thing that leads me into exercise. It is the Royal Canadian Air Force exercise plan; it is 12 minutes and they have charts you follow… Each day, you have to do the exercises within the 12 minutes and until you can, you can’t move up.

‘It is the exercise I have done off and on my whole life. It just very gently gets you fit. Two weeks of doing that and you think: “Yeah, I could go to the gym now”.’

Dame Helen was photographed in 2008 wearing the red bikini on a beach in Italy where she has a home with her husband Taylor Hackford.

The picture went around the world and cemented her reputation as a sex symbol at 62.

But despite the shot being very flattering, Dame Helen has previously said it will ‘haunt’ her for the rest of her life.

She said: ‘I don’t actually look like that and I know that that is going to haunt me forever and I’ll be forever trying to bury it unsuccessfully.’

‘The truth is I don’t really look that good, it was just a flattering picture. I am beyond the bikini-wearing age, really. I wouldn’t normally wear one. I look like a woman in her 60s. I’ve always looked awful in a bikini, even when I was young.’

Dame Helen won her Academy Award for Best Actress for her role playing the monarch in The Queen. She learnt her trade in the theatre before going on to star as detective Jane Tennison in popular TV series Prime Suspect and in dozens of films.
