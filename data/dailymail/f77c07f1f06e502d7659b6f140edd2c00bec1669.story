Nicky Clarke (pictured here with girlfriend, Kelly Simpkin) has admitted to his past as a heroin addict, saying the troubled time was the worst of his life

He has styled the tresses of scores of celebrities and Royals, from Princess Diana to the Duchess of York. And he still counts the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie among his clients. But behind Nicky Clarke’s perfectly preened locks and boyish charm, he has been hiding a dark secret.

‘It’s my biggest regret, and it horrifies me even now, but I have been in rehab for heroin addiction,’ he admits. ‘This is the first time I’ve ever spoken about it.

‘It was a very short period of  my life and I went in with a small  but regular heroin habit that I had  for a year. I am sickened when I  look back.’

The £500-an-hour hairdresser, who since his early 20s has become as famous as the celebrity clientele of his Mayfair salon, developed his addiction while embroiled in the New Romantics music scene of the 1980s.

He was part of a crowd that included Boy George and Steve Strange, who both almost died from drug addiction years later.

Though his years in the spotlight have been punctuated with accusations of infidelity and links to prostitutes, it is this brief dalliance with drugs that he laments the most. 

It was only after his then wife, Lesley, threatened to ‘kick me out or call the police’ that Nicky was forced to face his demons. 

But 27 years later, it is a subject that he still struggles to speak of. He has  not even confessed to his grown-up children, Harrison, 27, and Tellisa, 24. 

Nicky, 55, says: ‘I was secretive about it because they were very young children at the time,’ he says. ‘Harrison had just been born.

I had a picture  of him with me almost as a newborn that I kept with me while I was in rehab. 

‘Mine had been a very private habit, it was small but regular. I never mainlined heroin [he smoked or snorted it] – I can’t bear all that dirt. 

‘I was there for ten weeks and they gave me nothing, so I had to go cold turkey. I absolutely hated being there. 

‘I was silent and huddled  for a week. I felt like my life was being taken over because everything you do becomes psycho-analysed, and I just had to get out of there.

The celebrity hairdresser found fame in the 80s after opening his Mayfair salon in London

‘When people came out they would go to those narcotics anonymous meetings. I went to about four and  I hated it. It was a lot of euphoric recall, and it was so not me. 

‘I never touched it ever again but I can’t erase the past. Just remembering the smell made me feel sick.’For a man who has lived his life in the public eye, it is hard to believe he was able to keep this dark chapter of his life buried for so long.  

Clarke’s life story makes colourful reading. His relationships were played out in public, as were the break-ups. 

However, it was his affair with prostitute Natalie Springer that  generated his most vitriolic press coverage – and signalled the end of his relationship with millionaire interior designer Kelly Hoppen, who now stars on Dragons’ Den. 

Five years on from the furore, the stylist says he still has the ‘utmost respect’ for his ex-girlfriend, the so-called ‘Queen of Taupe’.

‘It might seem odd after everything that was reported but I have fond memories of my relationship with Kelly. I’m not someone who remembers the bad times, so all I will say is that I think she is brilliant.’

The prostitute, however, he concedes was a mistake. ‘Aah yes, I will admit I wasn’t thinking in the best sense when I turned to a prostitute and yes, maybe you could call it a moment of madness,’ he says, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. 

Though he is refreshingly honest in his answers, he talks of the  incident with a noticeable lack of remorse. ‘It certainly isn’t going to go down as one of my best decisions and I’m not going to sit here and  ask for sympathy because, let’s be honest, I did do it.’

Royal favourite: Nicky Clarke styled the tresses of the late Princess Diana in the 80s, and more recently The Duchess of Cambridge

His main gripe with the story lies not with the accusations – ‘the bulk of which are true’ – but with what he says are smaller inaccuracies in Miss Springer’s account of their brief liaison. 

‘The thing I was most annoyed about was that it said I had Primark sheets,’ he says laughing.

‘I certainly don’t have any bed linen from there, I’ve never been to Primark in my life.’ 

He may laugh it off now, but it was not the first time his infidelity had led to a painful break-up. 

An affair with model Susie Bick led to the collapse of his marriage of 20 years to Lesley Clarke. She was so devastated that she suffered a nervous breakdown. 

‘To an outsider it may look like I was a serial adulterer,’ Clarke admits. ‘But I don’t think that is the case. When Lesley found out we tried to make it work for three or four months, but the damage was done.’

Clarke maintains a relationship with Lesley, though it is somewhat unconventional, with the pair living four doors away from each other in St John’s Wood, North London.

They have remained ‘great friends’ despite his betrayal. Lesley is the powerhouse behind the £50 million Nicky Clarke brand and still has joint control of the empire. 

Another one of his long term clients is TV presenter Selina Scott, pictured here with the hairdresser in the 1990s

He admits he wouldn’t be where he is today without Lesley.

So successful was the brand they built that the hairdresser spent much of the early 1990s dividing his time between his Mayfair salon  and Buckingham and Kensington Palaces – a long way from the small council flat in Elephant and Castle, South London, where he grew up. 

‘I was doing mostly the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and the Duchess of Gloucester. I did Princess Diana as well, though only a couple of times,’ Clarke recalls fondly.

‘There was one particular time where Princess Diana was going to Pavarotti in the Park and I went to Kensington Palace. It was when Sarah and Diana were very close and going to the event together, so  I did both of them. Diana was just lovely, very friendly, and we were laughing and joking and she even made me a cheese sandwich. She was just very charming.’

While he is still privy to the salon confessions of the rich and fabulous – Cate Blanchett, Sharon Stone  and Elizabeth Hurley are all recent clients – the millionaire stylist claims to have put his philandering behind him and has remained loyal to girlfriend Kelly Simpkin for more than four years. 

At 31, Kelly is 24 years his junior. She was a trader in the City before she joined Clarke’s salon as a trainee hairdresser and later became his personal assistant. Their love, he says, grew out of that friendship. 

However, the relationship is far from blissful, as the couple have been forced to grapple with Kelly’s worsening health issues. 

She was recently diagnosed with lupus, an auto-immune disease that has left her with crippling arthritis and constant exhaustion and she can now only work in the salon part-time. 

And his own brush with serious illness in January this year, when he was diagnosed with a ‘grapefruit-sized cyst’ on his liver, gave Clarke a rare time for reflection. 

After a major operation to remove the mass, he was put on a strong course of antibiotics that caused him to lose a stone in weight.

‘The medicine just stopped my appetite and I was drained of all my energy – I felt like an old man.’

It was a ‘frustrating’ reminder of his own mortality for a man who has worked flat-out since the age of 17 and professes to have ‘done the hair of all the major divas of this world’. But despite his wild past and celebrity credentials, there is still an endearing humility to Clarke.

‘I’m still just the son of an electrical engineer who grew up in a council flat on the Old Kent Road,’ he says, getting up to leave. 

‘Yes, there has been some stuff I would like to rewind or erase from my past. 

‘But there have been so many moments in my life, for example when I’ve been kneeling over a bath washing Elizabeth Taylor’s hair or even when I just walk into the salon, where I can hardly believe the life I’ve had.

‘I am so grateful for everything. Life really has been good to me.’
