Shocking footage has emerged of a teenage girl being viciously beaten in a Burger King restaurant while staff looked on and did nothing.

The 17-year-old was targeted by two other girls at the fast food outlet in Byram, Mississippi earlier this month, with the incident filmed on a bystander's mobile phone.

It shows the girl being floored after one of the girl's takes a swing at her, before she has punches rained down on top of her.

The mobile phone footage shows the girl being knocked to the floor before she pinned to the ground

The 17-year-old victim then has punches rained down on top of her by her attackers

She appears to then be dragged along the floor by her hair before the two girls take it in turns to kick the victim as she lies on the ground.

The two girls then stop their attack before the teenage victim is eventually helped to her feet.

A bystander, who appears to be wearing a staff uniform can be seen in the background but makes no attempt to break up the fight.

The footage of the scuffle was eventually uploaded to Facebook and was brought to the attention of local police, who are now investigating the incident.

While the two girls brawl on the floor, staff members seem to stand by and watch and make no attempt to break them up

They warn charges could come against the attackers.

Byram Police Chief Luke Thomson told 7WDAM: 'They say a picture's worth a thousand words. If a picture's worth a thousand, a video's worth a million.And this video is very compelling in terms of the criminal charges that may be brought about.

'The thing that probably disturbs me most is the fact that nowhere in that video, in none of the audio does someone say, "Somebody call 911, someone call the police."

After the punches stop, they then begin to take it in turns to kick at the girl while she is on the floor

After the fight stops, the victim is eventually helped to her feet and police say they are now investigating

'That video is evident that there are a number of people in that situation and not one of them chose to call for help.'

It is now up to the victim if she wants to press charges.

If she does, it is likely they would be simple assault charges.
