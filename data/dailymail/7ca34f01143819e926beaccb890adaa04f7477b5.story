It sounds like the punchline to a horrible joke, but dozens of people who attended a summit on food safety certainly weren't laughing when they fell ill after consuming a meal served at the event. 

In a suspected case of food poisoning, more than 100 people reported getting sick at the Food Safety Summit held at the Baltimore Convention Center from April 8-10.

Officials won't yet confirm that food poisoning was the culprit, but they're dealing with an outbreak of gastroenteritis that has caused many attendees  to report symptoms like diarrhea and nausea.

More than 100 people have now reported they got sick with suspected food poisoning at a national Food Safety Summit held earlier this month in Baltimore

One in four people interviewed after the summit reported getting sick from a meal served during the event 

About 1,300 people attended the conference - and of the 400 who have spoken to health officials so far more than 100 were sick - prompting concerns that many more people may be affected, NBC News reports. 

'We are working on evaluating possible exposures and doing testing at the Maryland state public health laboratory to attempt to identify an agent,' read a letter from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene sent to summit guests.  

Ironically, among those affected were members of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  

'A couple of our folks indicated that they had experienced symptoms associated with food poisoning after the summit,' said FDA spokeswoman Juli Putnam.  

Peggy Daidakis, who runs the Convention Center, told NBC she was determined to get to the bottom of it.  

'We're not trying to hide anything,' she said.  

'If there is something, we'll take the corrective measures.  

'None of us are very happy when we hear these things.'
