David Cameron is facing a double rebellion this week as Tory MPs plan to defy Downing Street on immigration.

Tory Nigel Mills made clear yesterday that he will force a vote to toughen up the Government’s Immigration Bill.

He wants transitional controls on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants, which were lifted on January 1, to be re-introduced.

Contentious issue: Around 70 Tory backbenchers are supporting calls to ban Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants from coming to work in the UK

And
 despite efforts by No 10 to get him to drop the demands, allies of Mr 
Mills said that between 40 and 50 MPs are still set to rebel when the 
Bill reaches its report stage on Thursday.

Mr Mills yesterday refused to rule out ‘crashing’ the Bill altogether unless backbenchers get their way.

The
 threat comes after Tory MP Dominic Raab revealed he has collected the 
support of 105 MPs to end the scandal of foreign criminals claiming they
 have a right to a ‘family life’ in the UK.

Last night he said he is 
‘definitely pushing ahead’ with an amendment to the Bill that would make
 it all but impossible for a foreign criminal to exercise their Article 8
 right to a ‘family life’.

Mr Raab’s amendment removes the 
discretionary element, so courts would have to order deportation of a 
foreign criminal jailed for a year or more, unless he faced torture or 
death on removal, or if halting deportation would be in the 
‘overwhelming humanitarian interests’ of the offender’s children.

Ministers have been resisting the amendment, claiming it is so strict it could flout the Human Rights Act.

Taken
 together the two rebellions mean the Immigration Bill could see one of 
the most damaging revolts yet by Tory backbenchers.

Mr Mills said the 
MPs want to send a signal to Tory high command that the Government needs
 to do more to curb new arrivals, predicted to be between 250,000 and 
350,000 people over the next five years.

He added: ‘I don’t want to crash this Bill at all but I think there are some more measures needed in it.’

Mr Mills also backed Mr Raab’s amendment.Labour MP Diane Abbott said the row showed a ‘real antagonism’ towards Prime Minister David Cameron from his backbenchers.

She
 said: ‘Nigel Mills is wishing for the impossible and if I was a Tory 
whip I would be ringing my hands at this moment because he has not ruled
 out crashing the Bill. That’s incredible.’

A No 10 source said: 
‘Both David Cameron and Theresa May are determined to pass this Bill, 
which everyone acknowledges contains some very important legislation.
