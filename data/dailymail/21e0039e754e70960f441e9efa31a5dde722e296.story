And suddenly, it’s all about Zlatan again. It’s the weekend of France’s Clasico (Le Classique) as the meeting of PSG and Marseille jousts with Real Madrid v Barcelona, Bayern Munich v Dortmund and Juventus v Milan for the title of Europe’s classic Clasico.

The French match won’t win that title but this ‘Clasico’ carries extra spice because Marseille, revitalized by Marcelo Bielsa’s eccentricities, are top of Ligue 1 and PSG, vitalized by their owners’ billions, lie second.

Thus, with all the timing of a thespian ‘luvvy’, Ibrahimovic is suddenly ready for curtain up and is vying for centre stage. He has not scored since August, nor played since September and a couple of weeks ago Sweden’s medic was hinting that we are beginning to see Zlatan’s tired body call for surrender. 

But, as his autobiography declares: ‘I am Zlatan’. On Thursday he did light training, on Friday he put in a group session and, suddenly, ahead of Sunday's Parc des Princes grudge match, the buzz is all about ‘will he start?’ and ‘will he win the match with a trademark goal to put PS G within a point of the leaders?’ 

All of which is like a scorpion down the underpants for Senor Edinson Cavani. From the moment they shared a club, the Uruguayan has been Dr Watson to Zlatan’s Sherlock — not so much second fiddle as no fiddle, no music and no groupies. In Laurent Blanc’s 4-3-3 formation, Zlatan stomps the central turf and Cavani must play wide. There is no question who is team leader, who must receive the best passes and the most scoreable crosses. He is Zlatan.

Yet while the Swede has been out, Cavani has been a brilliant understudy, emphasizing why he, or perhaps Zlatan given his age and injuries, must move on. Cavani scored the only goal in each of PS G’s Zlatan-less wins over APOEL in the Champions League. 

Domestically, too, he has filled the Ibra-vacuum but it took him time to hit his most clinical form, given that playing out of position has eroded his confidence. Nor has he enjoyed the best of luck. Celebrating with his ‘rifleshot’ pose after scoring a penalty at Lens, the referee booked him (even though Cavani has done that every time he has scored for years without punishment). 

When Cavani questioned the decision, he was sent off, thus missing another Zlatan-free game to firm up his claim to the centre-forward role. It’s a dilemma — one which will probably be resolved with Cavani starting in the middle on Sunday and Zlatan on the bench. 

But it has caused much comment among those who know or just appreciate the vastly talented Uruguayan. Former Arsenal midfielder Remi Garde points out: ‘Prior to Zlatan being out, I think Cavani lost a bit of confidence, which caused flaws in his game. 

Edinson Cavani has taken the chance to stake his claim for the central striking role

‘He struggled with self-doubt and it’s difficult to be asked to do something extremely difficult — remain in Ibrahimovic’s shadow yet be prepared to replace him from time to time.’ 

Two further parts of the problem are that Cavani was brutally expensive to buy from Napoli — the €64m outlay helping to cause PSG’s Financial Fair Play problems. He has also had domestic strife to cope with. Never an aid to a ‘confidence’ player. 

Former Brazilian World Cup striker Antonio Careca is a huge fan of Cavani but is pessimistic about his future at PSG. ‘Edinson’s struggling with the 4-3-3 formation but PS G’s too big a club to expect them to change to suit him,’ he says. ‘He has to adapt. Zlatan’s a phenomenon — better than Cavani. If Edinson’s really miserable, he should leave.’ Blanc, architect of the move to 4-3-3, says: ‘Zlatan isn’t an easy man to manage but then nobody is. The guy is exceptional and there are others much less able than him who are far more demanding’. Read between the lines. 

On Cavani struggling when the Swede takes his favourite position, Blanc says: ‘It’s bound to be just a passing phase because scoring goals is in this guy’s blood.’ 

From Italy, the chorus of disapproval intensifies. Before hitting the big time at Napoli, Cavani starred at Palermo whose owner Maurizio Zamparini rants: ‘PS G deserve a coach of the highest level and I’d give Blanc 6.5 out of 10. If he wasn’t French, he’d never have been put in charge. They have to go to 4-4-2.’ All music to Bielsa’s ears. ‘Aux armes’ for the French Classico.
