Proud: Freddy Barnes, the son of Pete Barnes, wears a pilot jacket for the funeral of his tragic father

A helicopter flew overhead in salute at the funeral of the pilot killed when his aircraft crashed into a crane in central London last month.

Hundreds of mourners applauded the coffin of Captain Pete Barnes, 50, whose helicopter plunged 700ft to the ground after hitting the crane at the top of the Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall.

A flower arrangement topped by a model helicopter lay on top of the coffin, carried by fellow pilots at the Reading Minster of St Mary-the-Virgin.

A note attached to the wreath from his eight-year-old son Freddy was covered in handwritten hearts and kisses. It read: 'My dear Dadda Boog Barnes.

'I will never ever forget my best friend and I shall never stop talking to you.

'Love you forever, your best boy, Freddy.'

Capt
Barnes' partner Rebecca Dixon, 38, and the couple's other child 
Alexandra, 12, were joined by his mother Pauline and brother Christopher
for the hour-long service.

His family requested donations to the Air Ambulance service instead of flowers. Donations had already exceeded Â£2,500 by today.

Capt Barnes had been flying from 
Redhill Aerodrome in Surrey to Elstree in Hertfordshire to collect 
businessman Richard Caring on the morning of January 16 when he was 
diverted to Battersea heliport in bad weather.

His
twin-engine Augusta Westland 109 helicopter struck the crane on The 
Tower, One St George Wharf, Vauxhall, as he flew over the capital.

The crash of the burning wreckage also killed Rentokil employee Matthew Wood, 39, on his walk to work along Wandsworth Road.

Capt Barnes, who had worked on Bond films among others, had amassed more than 12,000 flying hours in a 25-year career.

His
children picked the Seamus Heaney poem Scaffolding to be read during 
the service as well as the hymn One More Step Along the World I Go.

Capt Barnes's brother Christopher gave
the eulogy alongside tributes from fellow pilot Patrick 
Margetson-Rushmoor and school friend Amer Nimr.

Hymns
at the service, led by the Reverend Canon Brian Shenton, also included 
Jerusalem, Lord of the Dance and Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer.

Mourners left the church to the sound of the Jungle Book's I Wanna Be Like You, while the helicopter flew overhead.

Another
flower arrangement in the shape of a helicopter lay alongside the 
coffin. An attached note, signed by Joey B, Niks, Finn and Fiona, read: 
'Barnesy, you were tip-top. Gone too soon but never forgotten.'

The hearse then drove to a crematorium for a private family ceremony.

Capt Barnes ran his own business, 
named Helivision , based at his home in Goddards Green, Mortimer, 
Berkshire, and also had a distinguished career flying air ambulances 
throughout Britain between 1997 and 2011.

Capt
Barnes had also flown for Redhill-based firm Rotormotion for 15 years, 
with his colleagues describing him as 'highly skilled'.

Following
the crash, Rotormotion managing director Capt Philip Amadeus said: 'We 
are devastated by the loss of a highly valued colleague and very dear 
friend.'

The experienced 
pilot was honoured for outstanding courage and skill by the Great North 
Air Ambulance after he completed a dramatic river rescue in October 
2004.

Great North Air 
Ambulance Service director of operations Kevin Hodgson said: 'Pete was 
as good a guy as you can imagine and one of the best pilots I've ever 
had the pleasure of flying with.'

Capt Barnes also worked as a contract pilot for the BBC Coast series and Sky News.

An inquest into the deaths of Capt Barnes and Mr Woods has been opened and adjourned by a coroner.

An investigation into the crash - which occurred during conditions of widespread low cloud, poor visibility and patches of freezing fog - is being conducted by the independent Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
