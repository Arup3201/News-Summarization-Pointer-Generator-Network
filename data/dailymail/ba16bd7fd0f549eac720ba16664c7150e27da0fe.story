A teenager who suffered a deadly stroke after taking the contraceptive pill has defied the odds to become a beauty queen.

Georgie Holland, from Thrapston, Northamptonshire, was left partially blind when she suffered a blood clot on the brain at the age of 17 brought on by the popular Yasmin contraceptive pill.

The 19-year-old collapsed in the middle of a dance class in 2013 and was rushed to A&E where a scan revealed the blood clot was affecting the flow of blood.

Georgie Holland has overcome suffering a stroke two years ago and is entering the Miss Galaxy competition

Georgie first became involved in pageanting when she began taking part in charity work

Georgie spent a week in hospital and has to take daily medication to thin her blood, but she has bounced back to compete in a number of beauty pageants.

Coming first in the Miss Galaxy competition next month would earn her a trip to Orlando, Florida, to compete internationally. 

Georgie said the experience had been the most terrifying of her life.

'When it happened, it was terrifying. I felt really dizzy and had to call my dad to come and pick me up from a dance class at school,’ she explained.

'It came completely out of nowhere. I had to sit down but couldn't think clearly and wasn't sure what I was doing or where I was. 

If the 19-year-old wins the prestigious competition she will travel to Orlando to compete

Georgie says that having a stroke had only made her more determined to compete in the competition

'I ended up walking out of the school and stumbling down the road like a drunk. My dad was passing as he was coming to get me and he found me collapsed in a bush.

'I spent two days in bed before being rushed to the hospital - a doctor was called out to my house as I was too ill to move.

'He was waving his hands in front of my face but I couldn't see them, that's when everyone realised that something was terribly wrong.

'I felt really sick and it was really frustrating because I knew what I was thinking but I was unable to speak without slurring.'

Georgie says that when they finally realised that she had had a stroke it had come as a huge shock for her and her family.  

Georgie will be representing her home county of Northamptonshire in the Miss Galaxy contest

Georgie's stroke left her with impaired sight but she says she's not going to let that get in the way of winning

'When my parents and younger brother were shown my brain scan their faces just dropped, I was so worried what had they seen.

'There was a big black blob in my brain where there had obviously been a clot or something.

'I lost my peripheral vision, so I couldn't see the top right corner of my sight, and I've still got that a bit. I'm much better now, though, and I have to take aspirin every day.'

Georgie will take part in the competition on Feb 6 

But despite her setback Georgie is now gunning to win one of the country's most prestigious beauty pageants prizes after making a remarkable recovery. 

She is in the running to be named Miss Galaxy UK after reaching the finals of the competition, which will be held at The Park Hall Hotel, Chorley, Lancashire, on February 6.

Georgie says that since her accident she has been concentrating on volunteering which eventually saw her enter the world of pageanting. 

'Since my stroke, I have been doing a lot of charity work and that's how I got back into doing pageants because you do a lot of charity work for them.'

The beauty queen says that without the pageanting she doubts she would have been able to overcome the experience.  

'It has given me a lot of confidence to move on with my life and live every moment to the fullest. 

'I hope the competition will help me forget and move on from such a horrifying experience.'

Georgie whose sight has deteriorated says that she is still determined to win the contest despite her condition.

'Losing sight in your eye is very scary - but I'm ready to compete and win the competition.

'It would be amazing for me if I did. It would be a dream come true.'

Georgie moved from Thrapston, Nothants, to Nottingham last year with her friend Nancy Burrows, to study at Nottingham Trent University. 

Nancy, 20 says that moving away from where the bad experience had take place had really helped Georgie to move on. 

'It's been good for her to get out of the small town we come from and move to Nottingham.

'She's been able to meet new people and do something different. She's a really happy girl, she wakes up smiling and that's why I think she does well in these competitions. 

'I don't see any reason why she couldn't win it.' 

Georgie's mother, Kim Holland, added that she was extremely proud of her daughter's inpiring story.

'I think Georgie has got back on her feet because of her determination. If she gets something in her head, then she does it.

'I'm really proud of her and I'd like to think she will do really well.'

Georgie says that as well as being a huge triumph for herself, winning would mean proving to other women that you can move on from bad experiences.

'It would be great to win it - I want to show other women out there that no matter what life throws at you, it can be overcome.'
