Clint Eastwood says his bizarre speech to an empty chair at the Republican National Convention was precisely what the GOP deserved for being 'dumb enough' to invite him to speak at a political rally.

The Hollywood legend, 82, says he was simply having fun during the head-scratching prime time performance, which became the most memorable moment from either Democratic or Republican conventions.

Eastwood also revealed his inspiration came from a speech he gave at a friend's funeral in which he played out scenes of his dead pal having conversations with 'mythic characters.'

Just desserts: Clint Eastwood says the Republicans should have expected such a bizarre performance

In an interview with entertainment TV show Extra, Eastwood was unapologetic about his August 30 performance at the RNC in Tampa, Florida.

'People loved it or hated it, and that’s fine. I was just having fun. I figure if somebody’s dumb enough to ask me to go to a political convention and say something, they’re gonna have to take what they get,' he said.

Eastwood, who describes his politics as socially liberal and fiscally conservative, is a Mitt Romney supporter and says he has met the Republican presidential candidate and will bring 'business sense' to the White House. 

Eastwood has been talking about the performance as part of a publicity tour for his new film 'Trouble with the Curve.'

He appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres' talk show and said he was libertarian and supports gay marriage.

Memorable: About 30 million Americans watched Eastwood's discussion with a chair -- and it became an instant Internet sensation

'The condition of society right now, with the high unemployment rates and the tremendous debt we're increasing and the government spending, we'd think there'd be more to think about than worrying about gay marriage,' he said.

He also told Ellen that most people thought he was 'going senile' over the RNC speech.

Eastwood says it was Romney's 'people,' not the former governor himself, who asked Eastwood to speak at the convention.

For 11 and a half minutes, directly before Romney's official nomination acceptance speech at the RNC, Eastwood address and empty chair that he pretended was President Barack Obama.

Thirty million Americans watched as he ad-libbed a conversation with the imaginary president. At least twice, Eastwood implied that Obama responded to his questions with profanities.

The strange speech became an Internet sensation and was lampooned in a series of memes. But even most Republicans were left scratching their heads over the performance.

Still, Eastwood says he would probably do the same thing if given the opportunity to make the unscripted speech it all over again.

Eastwood, who rose to fame playing a tough guy in films like 'Dirty Harry' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,' says he stole the inspiration from the speech from himself.

'Actually, I did a funeral speech for a friend of mine and I started talking to mythical people imitating him,' he told Extra.
