Here is some news that might cheer up Angel di Maria.

The Argentina international is having a miserable season at Manchester United but his form would not appear to be affecting his popularity - with shirts bearing his name requested more than any other player in the Premier League.

According to retailers Sports Direct, who sell Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Liverpool, United, Manchester City, Tottenham and Newcastle shirts, Di Maria's is the name asked for by almost one in 10 of fans in stores. 

Manchester United's record summer signing Angel di Maria tops the list of SportsDirect player shirt sales 

Di Maria has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford despite a bright start last year

Di Maria, Sanchez and Costa make up with top three with a combined share of 15.66 per cent

His tally of 9.59 per cent puts him streets ahead of Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, with the Chilean playmaker in second place with 3.8 per cent.

Di Maria has struggled for form since his £59.7million summer switch from Real Madrid.

He has also had to endure an attempted break-in at his home which saw him and his family move to a hotel in a panic before finding a new residence in the heart of the city centre.

But these figures will give the winger a boost as he bids to stop his Old Trafford career from ending before it has even began.

Alexis Sanchez has 13 Premier League goals to his name and is second with with 3.80 per cent share of sales

Chelsea's Diego Costa sits third as the Premier League's three big summer signings make an impact

Another summer arrival on our shores, Chelsea's Diego Costa, is the third most-requested player with 2.27 per cent ahead of Di Maria's United team-mated David de Gea on 2.16 per cent.

Speculation that the Spanish goalkeeper will quit Manchester to head back to his home city of Madrid to join Real has not deterred fans from opting for his name on the back of their shirts.

Belgium and Chelsea star Eden Hazard is in fifth place followed by United pair Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao - another South American import who is struggling to adjust to life in the Premier League.

MLS-bound Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard is in eighth place followed by Manchester City's Sergio Aguero in ninth while another United striker, Robin van Persie, completes the top 10.

Just missing out is Newcastle's popular Spaniard Ayoze Perez, who takes 11th place.

As for Christian names 'Jack' is the most popular request, accounting for 0.39 per cent of name sales.

Strikers are the most common to be asked for with Luke Shaw, the most popular defender, in 38th place on the list.
