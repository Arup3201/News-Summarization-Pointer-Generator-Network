A 17-year old boy has been left badly bruised after an altercation with a Louisiana police officer at a Mardi Gras parade in an incident captured on cell phone by a friend of the victim.

Footage shows Brady Becker, 17, being punched repeatedly in the face by plain clothed detective Nicholas Breaux in the incident which occurred on Friday night at Lakeside Shopping Center in Metairie.

Becker was arrested and charged with inciting a riot, resisting an officer, battery of a police officer and being in possession of alcohol while under the age of 21.

According to the  arrest report Becker is alleged to have shouted 'f*** the cops' multiple times at the detectives, but friends of the boy who were present deny that and say the attack was unprovoked.

Becker's friend, Jacob Jenson, 16, said the incident started when one of the detectives walked up and told him, 'If I punch you in your face, would I still be a f****** cop?'

Jensen said neither he nor anyone else in his group had yelled at the men, who they were aware were police, reports NOLA.com. 

He said he told the detective he wanted no trouble, but then the man asked him again in an even more aggressive fashion. 

At this point Becker decided to defend his friend. 

'I said, 'What the F is going on,' trying to find out why he's getting in his face. That's when he starts beating me up,' Becker said.

Becker suffered a cut to his left eyebrow, a fractured right cheek and jaw and black eyes. He was detained overnight and his vision still remains blurry

The detective then tackled Becker to the ground and beat him quite severely.

At a press conference on Thursday Becker denied that he had done anything wrong. 

'I felt like I was just sticking up for my friend,' he said.

He said his arrest has caused him and his friends to look differently at police officers. 

'We look at cops like they are our enemies,' he said. 

How Becker and his family are calling for the detective to be stripped of his duties.

'He just threw me on the ground and started beating me like that, and I really feel like he was committing a crime,' said the teen.

The boy's family say they have already filed a complaint with the Sheriff's Office, but the department claims it has not received a formal complaint, which would trigger an internal investigation.
