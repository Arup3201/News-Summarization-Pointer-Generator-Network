Star Trek fans were left awestruck at the weekend when their hero, Sir Patrick Stewart, hugged a young woman after she thanked him for helping her deal with domestic abuse.

After the British actor who played Captain 
Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation, told sci-fi fans in 
Texas about his campaign to end violence against women, Heather Skye revealed how his work had 
helped her cope with abuse.

Sir Patrick, who was one of the guests at Comicpalooza in Houston, responded by hugging the 
young woman and telling her 'You're safe now'.

On her Tumblr site, LemonSweetie, Miss Skye told her followers about the nervous energy she felt before being handed a microphone so she could thank Sir Patrick for a speech he had given for Amnesty International on violence against women, that had helped 'start my healing process'.

'After seeing Patrick talk so personally
about it I finally was able to correctly call it abuse,' she wrote. 'I
didn’t feel guilty or disgusting anymore. I finally didn’t feel 
responsible for the abuse that was put upon me.'

After the Star Trek fan asked Sir Patrick what he was most proud of, the actor told the audience about how he works with Refuge, a safe house charity for women and children, after not being able to protect his mother from abuse at home.

'I do what I do in my mother’s name because I couldn’t help her then. Now I can,' Sir Patrick said.

He added that he had recently discovered his father had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in the Second World War.

This has prompted him to start work, in his father's name, with the organization Combat Stress, which helps soldiers suffering from the same condition.

Before taking the next question, Sir Patrick asked Miss Skye: My dear are you okay?” which lead to the moderator asking if she wanted her hug.

On her Tumblr site, Miss Skye says: 'Sir Patrick didn’t even hesitate, he
smiled, hopped off the stage and came over to embrace me in a hug. 
Which he held me there for a long while. He told me “You never have to 
go through that again, you’re safe now".'

Sir Patrick has spoken previously 
about the violence in his childhood home. He said the violence was so 
bad that his mother Gladys would often be left 'bleeding on the floor' 
after his father Alf came home drunk.

The 72-year-old said the stage became a 'refuge' from his home and he felt safer acting than he did in his own house.

He has since campaigned to end violence against women, working with charities such as Refuge, which offers a safe house for those escaping a violent relationship.

The speech to Amnesty International, which his fan Miss Skye had watched, was part of the charity's Stop Violence Against Women campaign.

He told the organization: 'As a child witnessing these events, one cannot help somehow feeling responsible for the pain and screaming and the misery. It is deeply confusing, and these confusions are not things which are easily disposed of in adult life.'

The actor, who also played Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men films told the sci-fi fans gathered in Texas that he had recently taken part in the United Nations' Million Man Pledge.

'The people who could do most to improve the situation of so many women and children are, in fact, men,' he told the Star Trek fans, to much applause.
