A toddler who survived a Taliban gun attack which killed his journalist father, mother, brother and sister has arrived in Canada to start a new life.

Just two years old, Abuzar Ahmad slipped into a coma after militants opened fire during a family meal at a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital Kabul.

Six weeks on he has made a miracle recovery, and yesterday he put on a brave face before 100 well-wishers at Pearson Airport in Toronto, where many of his family members live.

Survivor: Abuzar Ahmad slipped into a coma after being shot five times in a Taliban attack which killed his father, mother, brother and sister in Kabul. He has arrived in Canada to start a new life with his uncle Bashir

Innocent: Abuzar, who will soon turn three, playing at home before he left on the two-day flight to Toronto

The toddler was accompanied by his uncle Bashir Mirzad, one of several relatives who stepped into the breach to look after him after he was hit by bullets five times.

Also with Abuzar were his new legal guardians, his cousin Turaj Rais Mohammad, 25, and Mr Mohammad's wife Zuhra Rais.

Speaking days after the attack, the 
boy's cousin said: 'Now he's completely in recovery mode.... Abuzar 
gives me hope. We are looking forward to a bright future for him.'

He said Abuzar had even reached out to grab his iPhone to play a video game, though he was unable to do so.

The flights from Kabul to Toronto took two days and ended in emotional scenes at the airport, where relatives and supporters held banners adorned with photos of the boy in hospital.

Touching: Family and well-wishers held portraits of Abuzar yesterday as they waited for him to arrive

Toys: The toddler was showered with gifts ranging from a single red rose to an Amazing Spider-Man figure

The toddler was a native of Afghanistan and lost his six-year-old sister Nilofar and four-year-old brother Omar in March's shooting.

The rampage shocked journalists and diplomats in Afghanistan because it happened in a restaurant of the Serena Hotel, seen as one of the safest in the country.

It was a heavily-guarded favourite of the city's elite, and to commit the attack the four gunmen - dressed in traditional Afghan tunics - slipped small pistols past security in their shoes and waited for three hours before opening fire.

On the night of the shooting several people were at a buffet meal in the restaurant to celebrate the Persian New Year.

Nine people were shot dead at close range, including Abuzar's 40-year-old father Sardar.

The journalist was a senior correspondent for the highly-respected news agency Agence France-Press.

Ready for a new life: An obituary described his father as 'a charming and talented journalist equally at ease covering Afghanistan's wrenching conflict as with colourful tales including a lion who lived on a roof'

High-five: Abuzar, with scars still visible on his knee, plays at home in Kabul before departing for Canada

An obituary described him as 'a charming and talented journalist equally at ease covering Afghanistan's wrenching conflict as with colourful tales including a lion who lived on a roof.'

The attack, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility, was timed to cause upset ahead of the country's presidential election last month.

The Gathering of Afghan Journalists Group released a statement on the 'tragic' events in which they described the attack as 'cowardly'. A tribute was paid to the 'experienced' and 'renowned' journalist.

'This incident comes despite the fact that Afghan journalists have assiduously tried to remain neutral in their coverage amid difficult circumstances,' the statement said.

'In this attack, the Taliban deliberately and ruthlessly targeted civilians, shooting women and innocent children around the dinner table.'
