A girlfriend saw her ex-boyfriend turn himself into a fireball on her driveway after she broke up with him, an inquest heard.

Ami Nahal, 36, was woken by an explosion at around 5am after dumping bricklayer Nick Davies, 43, the inquest heard.

She rushed to the window, saw a white van on fire outside and dialled 999 - then realised it was her spurned lover’s Citroen Berlingo going up in flames.

Firefighters battled to put out the blaze and found the body of Mr Davies, who was from Southampton, Hampshire, in the front seat of the burnt out van.

The ‘devastated’ father-of-two had driven to Ms Nahal’s parent’s home, where she was staying, and set himself alight after she broke off their ‘volatile’ eight-month relationship.

Ms Nahal, from Chandler’s Ford, Hanmpshire, said she had kept the relationship a secret from her traditional Sikh parents for fear they would not approve.

Ms Nahal, who worked for an insurance provider, said: 'My parents became aware of our relationship on the day of Nick’s death.

'I heard a loud bang. I jumped out of bed and looked out of the window and then called the fire brigade.

'I saw a white van and flames coming out. I ran back upstairs and looked out of my parents’ window - that’s when I recognised the van.'

Recording a verdict of suicide, Central Hampshire Deputy Coroner Simon Burge said Mr Davies committed 'an appalling act of self-destruction'.

Ms Nahal told the court she had tried to break off her relationship with Mr Davies on several occasions.

Shortly before the blaze began, Mr Davies left a voicemail for David Murtagh, his friend of 40 years, to say who he wanted to carry his coffin at his funeral.

Recording a verdict of suicide, deputy Coroner for Central Hampshire, Simon Burge, added: 'What he did was an appalling act of self-destruction and it's left to members of the family to deal with that.

'I'm satisfied that the relationship had caused him a great deal of pressure and that he was finding it difficult to sustain the relationship because of the demands it had placed on him and he simply couldn't cope.'
