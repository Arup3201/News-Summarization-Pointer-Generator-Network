Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed DeAndre Yedlin will join in January after the American right-back was granted a work permit.

The White Hart Lane club  agreed a four-year deal  with Yedlin in August but the 21-year-old did not meet UK work permit regulations.

But that has now been approved on appeal and the £2.5million signing will be finalised once  the transfer window reopens in January.

'We are pleased to confirm that DeAndre Yedlin will be joining the Club in January,' a statement on Tottenham's official website read. 

Yedlin, currently with the Seattle Sounders, caught the eye during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with the USA, and manager Mauricio Pochettino expects him to become a hit. 

Pochettino added: 'DeAndre is a young player with great potential who has already achieved a lot in Major League Soccer.

'It is important for his development that he is given the time to adapt to his new surroundings both on and off the pitch and we believe that by coming to us in January it will give him the best opportunity to do so.

'He’s still young with a lot of potential. He is quick, offensive situation, we believe he is a player that has potential to play with us. We will see. 

'First thing is to arrive and adapt as quickly as possible with the group and new culture, different football, new pressure. Always when a new player arrives in January with his profile, always needs time to adapt.'

Yedlin, currently with the Seattle Sounders, impressed during the 2014 World Cup with the USA.

The 21-year-old played for the Sounders against Spurs in the 3-3 friendly  in Seattle back in July, and also received offers from Roma, Anderlecht and Werder Bremen.

His arrival  comes after the north Londoners brought in Ben Davies, Michel Vorm, Eric Dier, Benjamin Stambouli and Federico Fazio during the summer.
