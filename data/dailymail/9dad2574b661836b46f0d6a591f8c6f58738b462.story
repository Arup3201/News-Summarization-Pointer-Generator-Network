These are the crumbling wrecks of condos which trapped residents of a Florida condo community are forced to call home.

Many of the boarded-up homes have been condemned by authorities, while even those deemed technically habitable are plagued by broken pipes, rats running up and down the walls and poor electricity supply.

But people living in the condos, just outside of Orlando, Florida, claim they are stuck with no money to go anywhere else and forced to live in crumbling  unsafe homes managed by landlords who refuse to make repairs.

Boarded up: Some homes in Tymber Skan, near Orlando, Florida, have been deemed uninhabitable

Problems: Residents have complained of broken windows and splintered wood in the 1970s homes

Beaten up: Some reports say the homes have yet to be repaired after damage from hurricanes years ago

Smashed: As seen in the images above, broken windows are often the norm in the beleaguered community

Those who live in the 1970s condos, many of which were bought up by investors, also face a further threat of losing their water and power altogether.

Owners demand rent while refusing to make vital repairs, even as local officials condemn the still-occupied houses, according to theOrlando Sentinel.

Jerletha Cosby moved to the Condo community with her four young children in hope of a new home. But, she told the newspaper, when she arrived she was greeted by a house full of exposed wires, rats running up the walls and thin plywood covering holes in the wall. 

Her two-year-old narrowly escaped being hit by a falling closet door and her fiance is making repairs to the home because the landlord won't listen. 

Residents complain that, partly because of the dire housing situation, they lack the means to go anywhere else. 

Another concern for those living in Tymber Skan is the threat to their water and electricity supply because of a local utilities supplier threatening to cut supply because of unpaid bills.

The total debt stood at $95,000 as of June 2014, according to local TV station WESH. 

'Slum lords': Occupants have hit out at their landlords, whom they say refuse to make vital repairs

Broken: According to charities in the area, many residents cannot afford to go anywhere else

A spokesman for the Heart of Florida charity told the Sentinel: 'People get into a situation like Tymber Skan and they can't get out, because they don't have the first month's rent, last month's rent, utilities and deposit to go someplace else.'

'It's a perfect storm for those who want to exploit low-income people, because they have no other options.'

The Blackwell family, who rent one of James Hurley's 36 condos in the community, say they feel trapped by him.

Leon Blackwell said: 'Once he gets you in here, he doesn't care anymore.' 

His wife added: 'He's the worst slum lord I've seen - he's still coming around threatening to serve people with eviction notices.'

Many residents have refused to pay rent in protest. Authorities have demolished a handful of buildings which had no hope of being repaired - but according to local news station WFTV, that costs $70,000 per condo.

As well as the cost, they are reluctant to continue doing so, because it often leaves residents in an even worse position.
