When David Carnahan's school crush lost her father last month, the young Texas boy provided more than a shoulder to cry on.

Devastated that Jolie Fowler and her younger sibling would grow up without a dad, David began raising money to help support the grieving family.

He's raised more than $1000 through donation website gofundme.com and in the process, 'learned a lot about what it means to give from the heart.'

Jolie's father died on December 23 from a medical condition. He didn't have life insurance.

Just four days later, David's mom Jennifer Weeldreyer Carnahan posted a fundraising profile online on her son's behalf.

'My crush since 2nd grade lost her daddy last week. He had no life insurance. I would like to help her family in some way. Please consider donating. Thank you,' the post said.

The adorable boy has raised more than his $1000 fundraising goal, with 39 donors, and plans to keep the page open until Wednesday.

'I told Jolie's family about the donations and they were very touched that the community cared about their family so much,' he wrote online.

'I can't even begin to tell you how happy my heart is that the community came together to support a family friend in need.

'Many donors didn't even know the Fowler Family but just wanted to help. WOW! I've learned a lot about what it means to give from the heart!'
