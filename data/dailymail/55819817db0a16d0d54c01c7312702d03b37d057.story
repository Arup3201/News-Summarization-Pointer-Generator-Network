An elderly World War II veteran may have hurt himself trying to comfort his dead wife after she died at their home.

Maria Ziemba, 84, and her 94-year-old husband Jan have both died in 'unexplained' circumstances but police officers believe that they were not attacked and may have fallen.

Police broke into the property in Berkeley Road, Newbury, Berkshire, on Sunday shortly before 10am after worried neighbours, who had not seen the couple since Friday, raised the alarm.

Police outside the house in Newbury, Berkshire, where two bodies were found this morning. Police are treating both deaths as 'unexplained'

It is understood police are investigating the possibility that Mrs Ziemba may have had a 'cardiac episode', fallen, and hurt herself.

Officers are believed to be investigating the theory that her husband then tried to comfort her before injuring himself and lying next to her for several hours.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'They had no defensive injuries, so that would suggest that no one else was involved.

'There is an ongoing investigation and officers are looking at lots of possibilities.

'It's just very sad.'

Initial post-mortem findings indicate the 89-year-old, who had bruising on her body, may have fallen.

Police are investigating how the the elderly couple came to suffer multiple injuries in the property in Newbury

She did not have any assault or 
defensive injuries, Thames Valley Police said following the discovery of
her body on Sunday morning.

Her husband had injuries to his head, shoulder and ribs.

He died after being taken to the John
Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Preliminary post-mortem findings revealed
he had injuries which indicated he had fallen heavily.

It is also believed he had internal 
complications arising from him having been lying down for many hours. 
Like his wife, there were no signs of assault or defensive injuries, 
police disclosed.

The couple had lived in the property for more than 30 years.

Detective Chief Inspector Gill Wootton said: 'While the preliminary findings of the post mortems into these two deaths appear to indicate a tragic incident, we are continuing our detailed forensic investigation at the scene and investigative inquiries in the area.

'We are acting on behalf of the family and the coroner to fully determine the circumstances around these deaths and also to preclude any third party involvement.'

Next of kin have been informed but formal identification has yet to take place.

Retired shop worker Pam Cooper, who lives opposite the couple's home, said she thought Mr Ziemba had a Polish background and had served on destroyer ships during the Second World War.

Mrs Cooper, 65, added that she understood Mrs Ziemba had been unwell recently. 'They have got family and quite a lot of friends, there are often people in and out of there.

'They are very well-liked. When he was about he was always chatty.'

Builder David Yates, a neighbour of the couple, said he would occasionally help Mr Ziemba with odd jobs around the home.

Mr Yates, 50, said Mr Ziemba had been torpedoed three times as he sailed with the Merchant Navy in the Atlantic convoys during the Second World War.

'He was very jolly and always happy to say hello. Jan was boisterous. Maria would come out fairly regularly and wander into town up until a few weeks ago but it's probably a good few weeks since I saw her in the road.'
