Check out Martin Samuel's account of the thrilling 2-2 draw between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield

Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool can still finish in the top four after dramatically salvaging a point against Arsenal.

Martin Skrtel’s 96th minute header secured a 2-2 draw against Arsene Wenger’s side and Liverpool’s manager believes the goal can provide crucial momentum heading into the New Year.

Arsenal’s performance was underwhelming but they looked set to record a significant victory after Mathieu Debuchy cancelled out Philippe Coutinho’s opener and Olivier Giroud pounced in the second half.

But Liverpool, who had Fabio Borini sent off for two bookable offences, dug in and Rodgers feels they showed enough to suggest they can recapture last season’s swagger and reclaim an unlikely place in Europe’s top competition.

When asked if they were still contenders, Rodgers said: ‘Absolutely. It is always going to be a big challenge. Of course, we have to make up points but we have shown this is a club that can go on a run and win games.

‘In the second half of last season, we went on a run of 11 wins. The most important thing is the confidence. When we bring Daniel Sturridge back in January, we can get back to being that team.

Liverpool, who are in 10th position, have 22 points from 17 games this season, and no Barclays Premier League team has ever finished higher than sixth with that record at this stage. But Rodgers is adamant his side are still performing at the level he requires.

‘Slowly we are getting back to where we want to be,’ he said. ‘Our performance was outstanding, the passing, intensity and the pressing.

'So we are disappointed with the goals we conceded but our character was very good. We have played better and dominated more than we did last year when we won 5-1.’

Arsene Wenger, by contrast, was more circumspect and he felt the memories of the demolition they suffered at Anfield in February was still playing on his squad’s minds.

Arsenal’s manager said: ‘They came back and played very well. They were down to 10 men. To concede the corner that was a bit unlucky. From then on we conceded. 

'Overall it is a fair result but a frustrating result for us because they came back when we had plenty of defenders on the pitch.

‘We had problems to get our flow going. In the first half, it was down to tactical and some psychological reasons. In the second half, we played much better but at 2-1 we sat back too much.’

Skrtel finished the match with his head bandaged. He needed eight staples putting into a wound that Giroud accidentally inflicted, which led to so much injury time – nine minutes in total were added – being played.

‘He is a strong character,’ said Rodgers. ‘Martin stayed on and scored a great header.

'He is a real warrior. Since he went back into the team he has scored goals and they are important for us. He was the top scoring defender in the league last year.’

Rodgers was aggrieved with Arsenal’s opening goal for a number of reasons, saying: 'A lot of our goals we give away are poor goals.

'I didn’t think it was a free-kick. I thought (Alexis) Sanchez dived but when it came in we lost three one-v-one headers, that is not about organisation that is about winning the duel. 

'In the first half we were outstanding but had to regroup at half-time. The key is we are moving in the right direction.’
