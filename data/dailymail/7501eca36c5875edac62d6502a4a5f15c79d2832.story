Ikechi Anya's face lit up and his mouth pulled into a wide small as he fell to his knees after placing a shot past Manuel Neuer.

The Watford winger looked like a child who had just woken up on Christmas day, understandable considering his 30-yard run in behind Germany's defence to slot the equaliser for Scotland beyond Neuer had just rocked the World Cup winners.

But who is the plucky player and where has he come from? Sportsmail explains all...

Magic moment: The Watford midfielder slots past the world's greatest goalkeeper to equalise for Scotland

Disbelief: A clearly emotional Anya celebarates his goal in Dortmund which put Scotland level

Is he the latest young hotshot to burst on to the scene?

No, actually. Anya is 26 and has had a diverse career already.

He played for Wycombe's youth team before Tony Adams made him their youngest ever player, aged 16, in 2004. But Paul Lambert took over and released him so he moved into non-League for two years – at Oxford City and Halesowen Town – before joining the Glenn Hoddle Academy and eventually earning a contract at League One Northampton.

Defensive ability: Gianfranco Zola taught Anya to play as a wing-back as well as an out-and-out winger

He then spent three years in Spain for Sevilla's reserves, Celta Vigo and Granada before a one-year loan deal at Watford in 2012 turned into a permanent move, signing a three-year contract for Gianfranco Zola.

Ikechi Anya doesn't sound like your typical Scottish name?

His background is as diverse as his football career. Anya's father is a Nigerian scientist and his mother a Romanian accountant. He was born in a council estate in Glasgow's Castlemilk.

He was bullied at primary school aged seven and shortly afterwards the family moved to London. Anya's father, Chinasa, wanted his son to follow his academic path, but Anya was always set on football. 

Pride: Anya could have played for England, Nigeria or Romania but grew up supporting Scotland

His older brother became a doctor, who raps in his spare time. You'd expect nothing less in the Anya household.

He could've played for England, Nigeria or Romania, but always supported Scotland as a child so it was a no-brainer when he received a call-up in 2013.

It sounds as if he bucks the trend then?

He certainly does. Anya is a deeply religious Christian and believes that marks him out from many other professional footballers.

'I’m religious and believe if you work hard you’ll get your just rewards,' he said in an interview last year. 'That keeps me humble. I don’t get ahead of myself.

On the move: Anya joined Watford in 2012 after spells in non-league and abroad in Spain

'I accept everything that happens to me in life and that helps to keep me stable.

'I’m a bit different from most players. If you talk to my team-mates they’ll all say that. It’s a good different though. It’s good to have variety with a different outlook on life compared to the cliched footballer.'

What's he like as a player?

Pace: Anya is quick, as he showed in his well-taken goal against Germany, but also has technical ability

Anya is a rapid flank man – aptly demonstrated by his burst of pace from the left flank to take him through on goal against Neuer on Sunday night. 

At Watford he was taught to play as a wing-back in a 3-5-2 formation by Zola, as opposed to an out-and-out winger where he featured for Scotland. He is good on the ball and a quick-thinker.

Anything else we should know about him?

Music, football and family are the three key things in his life. He takes music very seriously and likes to read-up on lyrics of songs he enjoys to understand them better. 

While at Watford he has also acts as a translator for some of the Spanish-speaking players.
