There is possibly one rugby ball in the entire building, but Brian O’Driscoll manages to find it and cradle it in his arms for the whole interview. Here is a man who has spent most of his life with a ball in his hands — developing such a natural connection that it has almost become a fifth limb.

As a player, he relied on guile and sleight of hand. These are traits that, he believes, are becoming devalued in a changing arena where junior players spend more time lifting weights than honing their skills.

There is a diminishing marketplace for ‘spindly little kids’ — the words used to describe O’Driscoll when he arrived at his first Ireland training session in 1999 — but the Irishman believes it is time to restore some old-fashioned values. ‘I was exposed to the gym at about 28,’ joked O’Driscoll. ‘I never had a huge love or appetite for it — it was just a means to an end. I get burnt in the sun, so there’s no point me getting pecs for when I take my shirt off in the summer.

‘In more recent years I got into it because it was a necessary evil. You have to adapt. You have to get a passion for it, but I don’t just know if that balance is there at the moment.

‘I never loved doing weights the way these young guys do. Their technique is phenomenal but it’s as if they’re winning if they have great scores in the gym. They’re not . . . they’re rugby players.

‘I’m not privy to the English set-up but at the academies in Ireland there is a huge focus on the weights room, as opposed to whether they can throw a 10-metre pass on the run. They should be rugby players becoming athletes, not athletes becoming rugby players.’ The team culture in English rugby encourages players to strive to be top of the charts in the players’ room.

It becomes a machismo contest to see who has the highest one-rep maximum on the bench-press or the Olympic squat.

Size matters, but amid a growing chorus of concern, O’Driscoll believes the obsession is only serving to widen the gulf in class between northern and southern hemisphere teams — with the All Blacks setting the standard. ‘I don’t think the gym monkey thing applies to them as much as it does over here,’ said O’Driscoll. ‘They have farmer strength. The Polynesian guys are pretty strong without going to the gym.

‘In New Zealand, they focus way more from an early age on skills. They do everything with a ball. They do all their fitness work with a ball and that’s why they have better skill levels. They have the balance; they have that physicality but they are able to mix their game up.’

With a strong Pacific Island core, many of the All Blacks are blessed with natural strength — Julian Savea and Sonny Bill Williams are both of Samoan descent.

A clean sweep of victories on their European tour was rewarded with a new deal for coach Steve Hansen and the Kiwis reinforced their position as favourites to win next year’s World Cup. England and Wales both failed to shoot down the world champions, but focus now turns towards the Six Nations, which kicks off on February 6.

O’Driscoll’s involvement will be as a pundit. He missed just one Six Nations campaign between 1999 and 2014, so it is natural that he still has the occasional pang to be involved. Ireland were expected to struggle after their talisman’s retirement but fared best out of the home nations during the autumn internationals.

O’Driscoll says that New Zealand will win the World Cup, but he is not so decisive when asked about his country’s credentials to win the Grand Slam.

‘Ireland are the form team and England look as though they took a step back in November,’ he said. ‘I think it will be the most open Six Nations for years — but I can’t see anyone winning the Slam. I don’t think Stuart Lancaster has been able to pair up people he would have liked to, particularly with Manu Tuilagi being injured. You would imagine that he’ll now back George Ford at fly-half going into the Six Nations.

‘I think a really good foil for Ford would be Kyle Eastmond and Manu. I think they could complement each other really well. I also really like Jonathan Joseph and Luther Burrell — who can play plenty for a big man — but I’d probably go with Eastmond.’

England’s midfield puzzle remains unsolved. The November Tests provided more questions than answers and Tuilagi is being heralded as the solution to Lancaster’s soft centre.

Like the Polynesian All Blacks, the Leicester man also has roots in the Pacific Islands. He is England’s most naturally powerful player and has the potential to spark huge collisions in the contact area.

O’Driscoll, a healthy-lifestyle ambassador for Coca-Cola, would never shirk a tackle on a player such as Tuilagi, but admits he is concerned about the long-term impact of the ever-increasing physicality.

Last season’s England Under 18 side were, man for man, heavier than the senior England side who reached the 1991 World Cup final. This has a direct impact on the risks of concussion and O’Driscoll’s family have been at the forefront in raising awareness of head injuries.

‘It was not something we sat and talked about over Sunday dinner,’ said O’Driscoll, who suffered a series of concussions as a player. ‘There have always been head injuries in the game. The impacts are getting bigger, but we are more aware of concussion these days.

‘It’s not a cool thing to play on with a head knock any more. It is not manly, it is not heroic; it is just stupid.

‘We’re guinea pigs from the physicality in the game, not from a concussion point of view but how our joints are going to be when we are in our 40s and 50s after the impacts we are taking. You see guys from the amateur era having knee and hip replacements at 45 and 50.

‘Having said that, I think we are physically considerably fitter than they were in the amateur era so our bodies are more toned to take that level of impact, at least I would be hopeful that that’s the case.’
