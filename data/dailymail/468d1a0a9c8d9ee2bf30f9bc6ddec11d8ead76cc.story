A lucky couple told today how they nearly missed out on a £1.8million lottery win - after putting their ticket out for recycling.

Richard and Diona Buss bought a weekly ticket covering both Wednesday and Saturday’s draws while on holiday in Cornwall.

But after the Wednesday draw drew a blank Richard, 48, put the ticket in the waste paper pile and thought nothing more of it.

In luck: Dione and Richard Buss from Bridgewater as they celebrate their £1.8m National Lottery jackpot win

It was only rescued when Mrs Buss, 47, had a last-minute 'niggling feeling' and retrieved the slip - which perfectly matched the Saturday draw numbers.

But the delighted couple were unable to confirm their win for 12 hours because the Camelot office was closed - and Mrs Buss kept her mind busy by ironing through the night.

When they were finally able to officially confirm their winning amount, of £1,888,630, the pair said they were 'dumbfounded'.

Jackpot: Tax collector Dione Buss and property developer husband Richard scooped the their £1.8m National Lottery prize with a ticket they threw away in the bin

Dione, who works as a local tax collector, said: 'We buy a weekly ticket for the two draws, on a Wednesday and a Saturday.

'Richard had already put the ticket on the recycling pile after the first draw, forgetting we still had Saturday to go.

'I dread to think what had happened if it had just been recycled, we very nearly lost all that money.

'Thankfully I had a niggling feeling and checked the ticket and saw that it still had that final draw on it that we hadn’t checked.

'When we realised we’d won and the amount we’d won it was absolutely unbelievable.

'It still hasn’t sunk in really, we’re still a bit dumbfounded.'

Travel plans: Richard and Dione Buss plan to travel the world with their new found fortune

The couple bought the ticket while on holiday with their parents, daughter Harriet, 19, and her boyfriend, in St Ives, Cornwall, at the end of September.

The Wednesday draw passed while they were away and Mr Buss tossed the ticket into the recycling pile when they returned home to Stogursey, Somerset.

But the following night - September 28 - they hit the jackpot and did not realise they had won until the following day when Dione retrieved the ticket.

The modest pair now plan to travel the
 world, visiting places they have never been, including climbing the 
Great Wall of China, as well as fundraise for a hospital unit at 
Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, very close to MS-suffer Dione’s heart.

'We want to do some fundraising with the money really,' Dione, who now plans to give up her job with Bristol City Council.

'I
 have always wanted to do it and now I have the perfect excuse to, it 
will be great to give back to people who have given us so much.'

Mr Buss,
 a property developer, added that the pair also plan to buy a classic 
car, as well as a plot of land to build a house on.

He
 said: 'We’ve also been given a list from Harriet, who wants a Fiat 500 
and a horse. I think that’s manageable. And I want to build up my 
collection of guitars.

'It’s
 funny, we used to laugh and say ‘we need to win the lottery’ to benefit
 all our friends and family - and now we’ve done it we have to come good
 on it.

'We can’t wait!'

The
 lucky couple, who have bought a weekly ticket since the lottery began 
19 years ago, made a small change from their usual numbers in 2012 after
 they scooped £1,238 matching five numbers.

They had only used their winning combination, 10, 12, 14, 25, 46, and 48 - made up of birthdays, ages and house numbers - for a year before the huge windfall.

Mrs Buss said: 'My daughter thought we were joking, as did my dad.

'Everyone is just so pleased for us, they keep telling us to sort ourselves out as a family now before we start using it for other people.'
