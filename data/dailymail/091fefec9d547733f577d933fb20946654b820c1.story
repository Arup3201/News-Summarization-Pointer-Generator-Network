Zlatan Ibrahimovic's career has taken him all over Europe, playing some of the world's best teams and with many legends of the game.

So it is no surprise that when the Swede told Paris Saint-Germain's television channel his dream team, made up of the best 11 players he's even played with, it should have a formidable look about it.

But, also unsurprisingly, the array of talent on offer was not so great that the PSG striker failed to find room for himself. Here are the 10 superstars that Ibrahimovic picked to play alongside him.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic was always likely to pick himself in any greatest XI, but who else did he see fit to include in his line-up?

Goalkeeper - Gianluigi Buffon

Italy No 1 Buffon played with Ibrahimovic during the striker's two seasons at Juventus.

With seven Serie A titles, a World Cup, and a one-time runner-up for the Ballon d'Or (which hasn't been won by a goalkeeper since 1963), Buffon is one of Europe's most decorated keepers ever.

Right back - Lilian Thuram

Another member of the Juventus team that Ibrahimovic spearheaded in the mid-2000s, Thuram is Zlatan's pick on the right side of his illustrious back four.

The French defender won the World Cup in 1998, at which he was given the Bronze ball as the third best player at the tournament behind Ronaldo, Davor Suker, and ahead of team-mate and final goal hero Zinedine Zidane.

Despite his illustrious career for club and country, Thuram is best remembered for his only two international goals, both of which came during the same game, the 2-1 win over Croatia in the World Cup semi-final.

Centre back - Thiago Silva

When picking your finest 10 team-mates, it's always sensible to include one or two of your current colleagues and Ibrahimovic has put his club captain Thiago Silva in at the heart of the defence.

To understand his importance, one need look no further than the appalling defensive display in Brazil's 7-1 World Cup final defeat by Germany, or PSG's slow start to the season this year, both in his absence, to understand his importance.

Luis Figo           Yaya Toure    Wesley Sniejder

             Thierry Henry  Alessandro Del Piero

Centre back - Fabio Cannavaro

Another World Cup-winner and a defender who has won the Ballon d'Or, it's hard to argue with the selection of Cannavaro in any team.

The former Italy captain played with Ibrahimovic at Juventus, before moving to Real Madrid where he continued his legacy as one of Europe's great central defenders.

Left back - Maxwell 

Perhaps the least-heralded member of this team, Maxwell might be in Zlatan's dream team as something of a friendly face.

The pair have played together for a large part of their careers, representing Ajax, Inter, Barcelona and now PSG. Maxwell is an accomplished full back, and - as with most players who play with Zlatan - has picked up a lot of silverware.

Right midfield - Andres Iniesta

World Cup-winning goalscorer, three-time Champions League winner, and one of the greatest talents to come out of Barcelona's famous La Masia academy. 

Alongside Xavi, Iniesta has become almost synonymous with Barca's mesmerising tiki-taka of the late 2000s. A central midfielder most of the time, he has been used on the flanks enough to let Zlatan get away with playing him out wide here.

Ibrahimovic described his mis-use at Barcelona as 'like buying a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat', but he still picked Iniesta in his team

Central midfield - Patrick Vieira

Arsenal's captain of the Invincibles, now Manchester City's reserve team manager, Vieira was one of the most complete midfielders of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Tough-tackling, powerful with the ball, and with an often overlooked ability to pick a pass, Vieira was the whole package. He joined Zlatan at Juventus in 2005, and the pair moved to Inter a year later following Juventus' corruption scandal, where they won three consecutive Serie A titles together.

Central midfield - Xavi

The metronome at the heart of one of the best teams club football has ever seen, Xavi at his peak would get into almost any XI you care to mention.

Left midfield - Pavel Nedved

The talented Czech playmaker was a hugely influential member of the Juventus team that featured Ibrahimovic between 2004 and 2006, pulling the strings from midfield while Zlatan banged in the goals.

It is often forgotten that Nedved was actually awarded the Ballon d'Or in 2003, as well as helping his national team to the final of Euro 96 years before that. During a long career, he was consistently superb.

Forward - Lionel Messi

Ibrahimovic's time at Barcelona is not always remembered particularly fondly, as the Sweden star was often shunted out wide to make room for the supremely talented Messi. 

'You bought a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat,' Zlatan complained as he failed to get the prominence he felt he deserved, and he even was less than complimentary about the trio of Barcelona stars in this team: ‘Messi, Xavi and Iniesta always obeyed without protest. They were like schoolboys.’

But, even Ibrahimovic has to concede, with this line-up, that when you have La Liga and the Champions League's all-time leading scorer, you have to play them in the centre.

Forward - Zlatan Ibrahimovic

The man himself. Only right that someone who so famously refers to himself in the third person should pick himself to play up front for his own personal dream team.

Between 2004 and 2011 the big striker won eight domestic titles in a row, coming as close to being a guarantee of success as any player in history. 

So his inclusion is probably fair...

Zlatan's team in full, complete with himself and Messi as a strike partnership, is formidable, but would it beat the alternative XI?
