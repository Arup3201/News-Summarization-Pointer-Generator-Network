Germany manager Joachim Low says that midfielder Mesut Ozil had the permission of Arsene Wenger to fly to Berlin despite missing Arsenal's win against Newcastle due to illness.

Just hours after the Gunners beat John Carver's side 2-1 at St James' Park - a game that Ozil was not well enough to feature in - the playmaker was spotted in a nightclub in the German capital.

It was a move that is sure to have angered club boss Wenger, who is likely to remind the 26-year-old of his responsibilities when he returns from international duty.

Germany play Australia on Wednesday in a friendly before contesting a Euro 2016 qualifier with Geogria on Sunday and World Cup winning manager Low said Ozil was allowed to travel to Berlin on Saturday.

'It's anyone's guess whether he was partying or not,' Low told reporters ahead of Wednesday's friendly.

'He has told me that he was in Berlin. I spoke to him and he said that he was weakened by a cold during last week and so Arsene Wenger and Ozil together took the decision to not play him at the weekend. After the match, he was allowed to fly to Berlin.'

Meanwhile, Low defended his selection of on loan Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski. The Inter striker has struggled for form and game time since joining the Italian giants in January 

'I saw his match against Cesena in the stadium and then spoke to Lukas the following day,' Low said. 

'The match was revived when he came on at half time. He is overall in better physical shape, but of course he has had initial difficulties in Italy.

'Lukas has always been there for us in the last 11 years. He gave it his all for the team. He has played loads of games and scored many goals. And he still has a lot of quality -- age has not taken its toll.

'He has our full support behind him. This will help him at his club, wherever he will be playing. It's important for him that he gets to play regularly and plays well.'
