Chinese manufacturers are shipping thousands of pounds synthetic chemicals into the U.S. to make dangerous recreational drugs - and it's all legal.

The Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. lawmakers are struggling to keep up with the influx of new, completely untested, compounds that Chinese chemists offer up online.

Websites for Chinese manufacturers advertise of host of chemical substances that can be bought legally by American citizens and shipped to the U.S.Â 

The drugs go by street names like Spice, Bath Salts, Molly, Smiles and N-bomb. They are meant to mimic the effects of marijuana, cocaine, LSD and other banned substances. Many forms of these drugs were legal until only very recently.

Off the market: Spice or K2, synthetic marijuana, is now banned in nearly every part of the country  - but new, legal, drugs are popping up

Any time one substance is outlawed, chemists churn out a new one.

In June, the DEA seized 2,200 pounds of synthetic drugs in a sweep across 35 states.

DEA Special Agent Doug Coleman told CBS News: 'For the most part China is the main source. They 
were probably the first ones to start it. Once they saw there was a big 
demand for it, they ramped it up.

'It's like whack-a-mole. They pop their head up, we hit them, they go down and then they pop their head up in another spot.'

Health experts say that just because a substance isn't illegal - it doesn't mean it's safe to use.

Authorities often become aware of new synthetic drugs when users start turning up in emergency rooms.

Synthetic drugs are responsible for tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. every year - 10,000 in 2011 for Molly, powdered Ecstasy, alone.

And they have been linked to the deaths of dozens of users.

Noah Carrasco, 18, of Scottsdale, Arizona, took N-Bomb - a new synthetic form of LSD - in January and died i minutes.

His mother told CBS News that it took toxicologists three months to determine what had killed her son.

And the drug was perfectly legal to import, buy and sell until November 15, when the DEA used its emergency powers to temporarily ban it.

'It's too risky. It's literally playing Russian roulette,' Noah's mother, Susan Wadsworth, told CBS.
