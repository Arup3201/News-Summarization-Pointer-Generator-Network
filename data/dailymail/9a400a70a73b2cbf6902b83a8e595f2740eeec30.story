Terrorist widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been charged with plotting to kill hundreds of British tourists.

The Muslim convert – who was married to 7/7 Tube bomber Jermaine Lindsay – is on the run in East Africa after police foiled an Al Qaeda-linked bomb plot against holidaymakers in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa.

Yesterday it emerged that ‘white widow’ Lewthwaite, 28, originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been charged in her absence by Kenyan police with ‘conspiring to improvise an explosive device with the intent to cause harm to innocent civilians’. It is believed she has fled to lawless Somalia with her three young children.

A police source said: ‘Lewthwaite has now been charged. Even if she is being protected in Somalia, it is very unusual for a white woman to be there with three children and it will not be long until somebody gives her away.’

Police
believe 28-year-old Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and 
British accomplice Jermaine Grant were days away from carrying out their
attack before he was arrested in December.

She stands charged alongside another Briton, Habib Saleh Ghani, who is listed with the alias Abu Osama.

Grant, a Muslim convert, went on trial for his role in the alleged Al Qaeda-linked plot this week.

He faces the same allegations, of possessing chemicals and 'conspiring to improvise an explosive device with the intent to cause harm to innocent civilians.'

But it was only yesterday that Kenyan authorities revealed that they had also charged Lewthwaite.

Lewthwaite, who was seven months’ 
pregnant when her husband Jermaine Lindsay detonated a bomb that killed 
himself and 26 others on July 7, 2005, was travelling in East Africa on a
false passport when she was arrested with Grant five months ago.

She fled and is now being hunted by the CIA, Scotland Yard and Kenyan police and is thought to be in hiding in Somalia.

Islamic fundamentalist Grant, 29, from
Newham, East London, denies bomb-making charges with intent to ‘cause 
loss of lives to innocent civilians’.

Police believe their targets included the Serena Beach Hotel, popular with British tourists, and a nearby shopping centre.

Grant said nothing when asked by 
reporters if he knew the whereabouts of Lewthwaite, who is also a Muslim
convert.

Ghani and Lewthwaite are also charged with a second count of 
conspiracy to cause an explosion.

The maximum sentences for both charges
are seven years each.

'Samantha Lewthwaite was charged in absentia and a warrant of arrest 
issued against her," said Jacob Ondari, Kenya's assistant director of 
public prosecutions.

Prosecutor Jacob Ondari said he believed university-educated 
Lewthwaite was linked to the plot and was the main financier.

He told the Mail: ‘Samantha Lewthwaite
is linked to Grant. It is the same bomb plot and they were working 
together. She is wanted by police over this plot. We believe she was the
main financier.’

The cocktail of bomb-making chemicals found 
in one of the four properties rented by Lewthwaite in Mombasa was listed
in court.

It included acetone, hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate –
the material used by Lindsay on 7/7.

Grant appeared in court alongside his 
19-year-old Muslim wife Warda Briek, a local businessman’s daughter.

The pair were married a day before his arrest on December 20.

He posed in Mombasa as a Canadian car dealer using a false name, the court heard.

A witness said he met Grant last year 
at a mosque in the city. Hassan Mohammed Hajj told the court Grant 
introduced himself as a car and mobile phones dealer.

He said: ‘We attended prayers several 
times at the mosque. He introduced himself as a Canadian, Ali Mohammed 
Ibrahim, and I warmly welcomed him to Mombasa as a brother in Islam.’

He added: ‘After prayers, we  had a coffee together.

‘When I asked him what he does for a living, he replied that he is a businessman from Canada.’

Lewthwaite’s family say they have not seen her for years. The case was adjourned until August.
