Two men have been killed after Hurricane Barbara hit Mexico's southern Pacific coast yesterday, flooding roads and toppling trees before weakening to a tropical storm as it spread inland.

There were reports of 60mph winds and intense rainfall battering the coast, which prompted authorities to erect shelters and suspend schools as it tried to deal with the storm.

Local emergency services said a 
61-year-old U.S male surfer drowned during
the storm. A 26-year-old Mexican man was killed as he tried to cross a 
river.

The director of civil defense for Oaxaca
state, Manuel Maza Sanchez, said the surfer, from Colorado,Â  died 
while surfing at Playa Azul, a beach near the resort town of Puerto 
Escondido, when Barbara hit as a Category 1 
hurricane about 120 miles (200 kilometers) to the east.

He said the man was dragged out by waves kicked up by Barbara and then battered against the shore.

The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City was not immediately able to confirm the man's name, nationality or hometown.

Maza Sanchez also said the Mexican drowned in the nearby city of Pinotepa Nacional while trying
to cross a rain-swollen creek.

Very strong winds and intense rainfall had hit the region and power outages were reported

According to media reports, 14 fishermen disappeared in the state of Oaxaca during the storm, but local emergency services said they could not confirm that information.

The hurricane was churning north-northeast at about 9mph and is expected to weaken rapidly overnight, the NHC said.

Mr Maza said that very strong winds and intense rainfall had hit the region and that power outages were reported.

Mexican state oil monopoly Pemex said that operations were normal at its biggest refinery, located in the port of Salina Cruz. The plant has the capacity to process 330,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Ports for small vessels in the area have been closed and emergency services in Oaxaca said they evacuated residents from some areas as a precaution, including the immediate vicinity of the refinery.

It drenched the sparsely populated stretch of Mexico with rain after making the second-earliest landfall since reliable record-keeping began in 1966.

On May 23, the National Hurricane Center had said odds favoured a below-normal hurricane season in the eastern Pacific for 2013.

It said 11 to 16 named storms were likely, below the 15-storm annual average for 1981-2010.

But Barbara appeared to start the Pacific season unusually early, and such storms often form closer to the resort of Acapulco, to the west.

Officials in Oaxaca had rushed to prepare emergency shelters and suspended school for children in coastal communities as rain began lashing the coast when the storm formed close to shore.

The area first hit by the storm is a largely undeveloped stretch of coastal lagoons, punctuated by small fishing villages.

The major Gulf oil port of Coatzacoalcos is located on the other side of the narrow waist of Mexico known as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

But the hurricane center predicted Barbara would dissipate into a rain system well before reaching Coatzacoalcos.

Maza Sanchez said classes would be suspended at schools along the coast for the rest of the week.

Storm shelters were set up in 20 towns and hamlets, and such shelters are often installed at schools.
