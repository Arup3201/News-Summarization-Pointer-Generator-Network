A group of Boston taxi drivers is suing the city, saying officials have violated their rights by allowing the likes of Uber and Lyft to operate without licenses.

Drivers are demanding damages and more oversight in a suit filed against the city of Boston at a federal court in the city.

Drivers Raphael Ophir and Joseph Pierre, as well as industry group the Boston Taxi Owners Association launched the action.

Unconstitutional? Taxi drivers in Boston say the regulatory set-up that exists now violates the 14th amendment, which guarantees equal treatment under the law (file photo)

According to the Boston Globe, they complain that while they have to buy expensive taxi medallions for their cars, Uber drivers do not. 

Taxi drivers say this violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal treatment under the law, because it applies different rules to similar services.

The suit said: 'The City has . . . permitted the de facto taxi companies to flout the law with open impunity by deploying an invasion of unlicensed cars and drivers with no requirement of any medallion.' 

Uber has historically responded to such complaints by saying it is a technology company which connects riders and customers, rather than directly providing transportation.   

A city spokeswoman said officials hadn't received the complaint Friday and officials will review it. A city advisory commission has been examining the regulations.

Legal struggles: Uber has been struck by lawsuits across the country, and is now banned in Portland, Oregon and Las Vegas

The lawsuit also challenges proposed state rules to have the Department of Public Utilities regulate ride-hailing services as 'transportation network companies.'

The legislature hasn't approved the proposal. The lawsuit asks a judge to stop the state from enacting it.

The action is part of a series of legal struggles over Uber, which has been banned in Las Vegas and Portland, Oregon.

Legal decisions are also awaited in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pennsylvania over whether the company can operate.
