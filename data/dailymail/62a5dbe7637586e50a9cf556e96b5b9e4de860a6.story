A U.S. judge yesterday fined BP a record £2.5billion for its role in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster.

The company agreed in November to plead guilty to charges involving the deaths of 11 workers in the April 2010 drilling rig explosion that started the spill.

More than 200million gallons of oil spewed in the three months before BP’s blown-out Macondo well could be capped. It was one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history.

A series of government investigations 
have blamed the blow-out on cost-cutting decisions by BP and its 
partners on the drilling project.

BP
separately agreed to a settlement with lawyers for Gulf Coast residents
and businesses who claim the spill cost them money.  BP estimates the 
deal will cost the company roughly £5billion.

Lawyers
for BP and the U.S. Justice Department said the plea agreement imposes 
‘severe corporate punishment’ and will deter deep-water drilling 
companies from allowing another disaster to occur.

U.S.
District Judge Sarah Vance said the plea deal was ‘just punishment’ 
considering the risks of litigation for BP and the alternatives to the 
settlement.

She told victims’ relatives who were 
in court that she read their ‘truly gut-wrenching’ written statements 
and factored their words into her decision.

‘I’ve heard and I truly understand 
your feelings and the losses you suffered,’ she said, adding that she 
also believes BP executives should have personally apologised to family 
members.

‘I think BP should have done that out of basic humanity,’ Judge Vance said.

The
deal does not resolve the federal government’s civil claims against BP.
The company could pay billions more in penalties for environmental 
damage.

The Justice Department has reached a 
separate settlement with rig owner Transocean that resolves the 
government’s civil and criminal claims over the Swiss-based company’s 
role in the disaster.

Transocean agreed to plead guilty to a 
charge of violating the Clean Water Act and pay £890million in civil and
criminal penalties. There will be a hearing regarding that criminal 
settlement next month.

Many relatives of rig workers who died in the blast submitted written statements critical of BP’s deal.

Gordon Jones’s family members said BP’s sentence should include a personal, face-to-face apology to the 28-year-old’s widow and children by BP executives.

A brother of Mr Jones also had urged Judge Vance to consider stiffer penalties that prohibit or limit the company’s ability to operate in U.S. waters.

But Judge Vance said she couldn’t get involved in plea negotiations and only could impose a sentence that adheres to the agreed-upon terms if she accepted it.

In April 2011, mourners gathered near 11 
crosses for the workers who died in the Deepwater Horizon explosion and 
one for the Gulf of Mexico during a vigil to mark the first anniversary 
of the spill.
