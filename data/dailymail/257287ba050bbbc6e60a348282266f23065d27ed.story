When opportunity knocked Les Ferdinand paid attention. From non-League Southall to the England team and most recently to a desk in his office behind which he sits in his designer knitwear while Queens Park Rangers train.

He'd rather be out on the grass, he explains, but this interview is keeping him indoors and, when the director of football picks a route through the mud to pose for a photograph, the temptation for some is too much to resist.

'F***ing hell Les, we've only won one game,' yells Joey Barton, from the midst of a nearby finishing drill, his verbal arrows more accurate than anything from his feet, as usual.

The other players titter and Ferdinand laughs along. The mood is relaxed ahead of Saturday's game at Hull City where Chris Ramsey tries to build on victory at Sunderland, the first away points of a difficult campaign, before they fly to Dubai for a training break.

'In a short space of time, there's been a positive turn,' smiles Ferdinand. 'The reaction has been great. We want to be a Premier League side. We know the figures. We also know the first year up is the hardest. Our focus is on staying in this division and everyone to a man is confident of doing it.'

Survival is vital with Financial Fair Play penalties hanging over QPR if they slide into the Football League and a large part of Ferdinand's role is to set down principles to keep the club within its means based around growing their own players.

Ferdinand explains: 'In this country, we'll buy someone from abroad for £20m who has been playing professional football for years and we all go: 'Give him a year to 18 months to settle in'.

'Yet we'll take someone out of the development squad who has never played any senior football in his life and if he's not a world-beater within two games everyone's saying: 'Well, he's no good is he'.

'Why not afford the kid the same opportunity? It's incredible. We're making English players and English coaches appear mediocre and they're not. They're more than that, given the opportunity.'

He speaks from experience and with QPR in his blood. Hayes signed him from nearby Southall for £5,000 and sold him a few months later to Queen's Park Rangers for an initial £15,000, plus another £15,000 based on appearances and a 10 per cent sell-on which turned out to be £600,000.

Born in Paddington and raised in Ladbroke Grove, he walked by Loftus Road every day on his way to Christopher Wren School, now Phoenix High School in Shepherd's Bush.

'I wasn't a QPR fan but they were the only team I saw play live when I was a kid,' said Ferdinand. 'My cousin's husband brought me to a game against Leicester when I was 11 and Phil Parkes saved a penalty.

'The thing I was most impressed about was that he played in goal with bare hands. I stood behind the goal thinking: 'Woah, this geezer's got no gloves on, man' and I ended up playing in goal at school for three years because of that.

'With players like Stan Bowles and Rodney Marsh, they were always associated with entertaining football. Terry Venables went in and got them promoted and the plastic pitch was in full swing when I joined. There was none of this 3G and 4G, there were no 'G's involved at all.'

He lost 4-1 at Coventry, but Cyrille Regis left a big impression. 'He'd come from non-league like me,' said Ferdinand. 'He looked so massive and strong and had this aura. I was thinking: How do I get to that?'

His second appearance was worse – a 7-1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday – before he returned from a year on loan at Besiktas to established himself in a team managed by Gerry Francis. They were the top London club in 1993, finishing fifth in the inaugural Premier League.

'QPR went out and bought well from the lower divisions and made players better,' said Ferdinand. 'Players came through the ranks, like Kevin Gallen, Bradley Allen and Danny Dichio. People moaned that we sold our best players, but we couldn't compete for multi-million pound players.

'I came when it was acceptable for QPR to go and spend £30,000 on a non-league player but clubs have stopped doing it. The demands are such that if you're not spending £10million on players in every transfer window, you're not competing and lack ambition.

His goalscoring record at QPR was impressive after 80 goals in just 163 appearances for the London club

Newcastle United signed him from QPR for £6million and he was extremely prolific at St James' Park

'It's about educating. We weren't buying players for £3million back then. We were selling for that money and for a club like QPR this has to be the avenue.'

Years of boardroom instability and managerial chaos seem to have left the club with an identity crisis which Ferdinand will address with the backing of owner Tony Fernandes.

'I will look at the long-term future of the club,' said the director of football. 'And we will make sure it works. My job is not to sign players. It's to work with all areas of management to improve the club.'

At the heart is youth development and opening pathways to the first-team. 'I'm not saying our first-team is going to be full of 21-year-olds,' he said. 'You need experienced heads. When I came here I had the likes of Ray Wilkins and Nigel Spackman to help me.

'But we need to attract youngsters here by giving them the opportunity in the first-team. That has to be our selling point. With respect, if you go to Chelsea and some of the bigger clubs, you're not getting a chance to play in the first-team unless you're the most exceptional of the exceptional.'

Ferdinand and Ramsey were previously employed at Tottenham as part of a coaching team responsible for nurturing Harry Kane, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb.

'All of a sudden the conveyer belt has started,' he said, and the desire to strengthen the same Spurs connection at Loftus Road prompted Ferdinand to recommend Tim Sherwood for the job when Harry Redknapp quit.

'It is my remit is to bring people in who will progress the club,' said Ferdinand. 'We'd done well at Tottenham and I know what he does. We're good friends but I can't afford to bring someone in here because he's my mate.

'He's a very good manager but he opted for Villa before we really had a chance to sit down and talk and the way things happened we had to act quickly. Anyone coming in from outside was going to be a gamble.

'And, as the owner has said, the job is Chris's to lose. I know what he's capable of. He's been doing it forever, but he's never had the opportunity.'

This is Chris Ramsey's first managerial position and has the tough task of saving QPR from relegation
