A mother of four has been found dead in a burnt-out car just 18 months after her partner was shot dead.

Donna Eastwood, 26, whose children are aged between five and eight months, was murdered after a petty row broke out at a party near her home on Friday night.

She is thought to have been stabbed before her killer tried to cover up the murder by dumping her body in a car which was set ablaze on a remote country lane in Wilmington, Kent.

Last night detectives were questioning a 26-year-old man on suspicion of murder after her body was discovered in the rural enclave at 6.20am on Saturday.

After a frantic search by police helicopters and teams scouring local woodland and fields, a man was arrested at 2.30pm yesterday.

The development came hours after speculation on social media about the identity of the killer, said to be known to the victim. It is understood an argument broke out at the party after a remark by Miss Eastwood caused another reveller to fly into a rage.

Miss Eastwood, of Dartford, had only recently lost her partner and father of three of her children, Kevin McKinley, who was shot dead last year.

The 32-year-old was blasted with a 12-bore shotgun as his son sat yards away in a parked car last February. 

Michaela Sargeant, 25, was jailed for eight years for manslaughter after shooting Mr McKinley in a dispute outside her Dartford home.

The woman's body was found in a car which had been set ablaze down a country lane in Wilmington, Kent 

Police cordoned off the road where her body was found amid a frantic hunt for the culprit on Saturday 

Her partner, 26-year-old Lewis Wickenden, was jailed for five years for assisting an offender. At the time of his death, a distraught Miss Eastwood wrote on a tribute site: ‘One love for u never stop lovin u never xxxxxxxxxxxx.’

Last night police said they did not believe his death was linked to Miss Eastwood’s murder. Yesterday a member of Miss Eastwood’s family said: ‘She’s got four young kids and they lost their dad last year. One of them is only eight months and another is only 18 months, they don’t even know what’s going on yet.

‘We don’t want any more trouble. We’re a big family and we’re just trying to take it in and make sure the babies are looked after.’

Last night neighbours claimed that the young mother had a troubled upbringing.

One said: ‘She was a nice girl, always said hello to you but her life was diabolical.

‘I don’t know how her mother has the strength to cope with it to be honest, because a lot of the time she was looking after the four children as well.’

Police scoured the area with helicopters and riot vans after the mother's body was found in a burnt out car 

Michaela Sargeant was charged with manslaughter following Mr McKinley's death last year. She is serving an eight-year sentence in jail 

Last night friends left floral tributes at the leafy country lane where her body was found in a spot popular with dog walkers, runners and horse riders.

A police spokesman said: ‘Kent Police is treating the death of a woman, who police believe to be from the local area, as an isolated, targeted attack in which the offender and the victim knew each other.

‘There is no information to suggest members of the public are in danger.’
