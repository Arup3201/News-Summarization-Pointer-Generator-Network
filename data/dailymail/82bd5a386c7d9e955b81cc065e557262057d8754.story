Caroline Wozniacki and Serena Williams helped each other get over their early French Open exits as they hit Miami Beach on Saturday.

The two spent some quality time together in their sexy swimwear. Serena went for a leopard print one-piece to show off her curves while Caroline chose a blue and white striped bikini that displayed her trim and taut figure at its best.

The Miami jaunt came after Wozniacki not 
only was out of the French Open in the first round, but also that she 
had split with golfing pro Rory McIlroy.

Last week, McIlroy announced he and Wozniacki had mutually decided to split only days after sending out wedding invitations.

He confirmed the relationship had ended after he realised he was not ready for marriage.

The
 golden couple of sport enjoyed a short-lived engagement after 
announcing to their million plus Twitter followers last new year's eve 
that they were to marry.

Taking a break: Although she was on holiday, Wozniacki joined Instagram and posted a photo of herself and her pals at the beach

At the time the pair posted matching pictures of themselves with a ring.

It
 is understood the couple - dubbed Wozzilroy in some circles after a 
golf wedge was engraved with the moniker - had been an item for more 
than two years.

They were forced to scotch rumours of a split late last year.

As
 recently as last month, McIlroy's Twitter feed suggested there were no
 signs of trouble in the relationship after he posted a picture from 
Nobu restaurant in Monte Carlo where the pair had dinner

Reports have suggested that Dane Wozniacki was dumped in a three-minute phone 
conversation.

Choosing
 her words carefully about her personal situation at a press conference during the French Open, she dispelled any 
suggestions that the break-up was ‘mutual’.

'Obviously you’re not 
prepared for something like this,' she revealed.

'It came as a bit of a shock.'
