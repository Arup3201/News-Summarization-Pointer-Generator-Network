Finnish police have apologised after Russian President Vladimir Putin was mistakenly put on the country's secret list of criminals.

The premier would have been arrested at the border had he tried to enter the country after he was added to the register for his contact with the Russian motorcycle gang Night Wolves.

Mr Putin is not suspected of committing a crime in Finland himself and a police spokesman said that his name had now been removed and an investigation launched into how it got there.

Tonight Finland quickly removed 
Putin's name from the list which is not public and said his name was 
accidentally included, but had since been deleted.

'I wish to extend Russia's President 
Vladimir Putin sincere apologies for the incorrect registry entry,' 
Interior Minister Paivi Rasanen said in a statement.

But the mistake doesn't seem to have 
bothered the president much, as pictures were released today of him 
frolicking in the snow with his dogs.

We're used to seeing Mr Putin taking 
any opportunity to cultivate his action man image in a series of macho 
poses, fly fishing bare-chested or diving into an icy river.

But Putin's latest man-vs-nature photo
opportunity appears to have shown us his softer side - as he has been 
snapped rolling around in the snow playing with his dogs.

Dressed
in a patriotic red and white Russia snow suit and wearing a 
warm-looking fur hat, the Russian premier looked at ease as he strolled 
in the forest snow close to Moscow with his fluffy pets, Yume, an Akita 
Iku, and Buffy the Bulgarian Shepherd.

But never one to miss the opportunity of a good publicity shot, Putin's hat was soon off and he was soon rolling around in the snow with the two dogs.

The Russian premier has been pictured in the past tagging tigers, shooting crossbow darts at a whale and flying a fighter plane.

He has even released his own judo DVD imaginatively entitled 'Learn Judo with Vladimir'.

But
the latest publicity shots of Mr Putin are a far cry from embarrassing 
pictures earlier this week when he was snapped looking bemused as he was
confronted by topless protestors while in Germany.

The activists, who strip off to highlight a range of issues, including women's rights, press freedom and domestic violence were dragged kicking and screaming from the premises by security guards

As one women tried to push through to Putin she was blocked by his aides - her back was painted with an obscene word directed against the Russian president.

They stripped off to the waist and shouted slogans calling the Russian leader a 'dictator' before being covered up and bundled away by security men.

But a smiling Putin eventually shrugged off the protest and joked: 'As for the action, I liked it.'

Mr
Putin is currently in his third term as President of Russia. He 
initially served between 2000 and 2008, but constitution restricts a 
president to two terms in Russia.

He served as Prime Minister for the next four years, but was re-elected after standing again in May last year.
