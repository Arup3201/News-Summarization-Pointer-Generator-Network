Comedian Chris Rock has been pulled over by police for the third time in less than seven weeks, according to a selfie he has posted online with the words: 'Stopped by the cops again wish me luck.'

In the image, the 50-year-old star is seen sitting in the driver's seat of his vehicle, dressed in a dark top and a large pair of glasses, with what appear to be blue patrol car lights  flashing behind him.

Within minutes of Rock uploading the photo to Twitter on Monday night, hundreds of users were taking to the social network to wish him 'good luck' and ask him why he had been stopped by cops.

Tweet: Alongside the photo, the 50-year-old star wrote the words: 'Stopped by the cops again wish me luck'

It remains unclear why, or where, he was pulled over. Just two days earlier, he had been pictured posing on the red carpet at the Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, California, alongside his family.

It comes as police across the US remain under scrutiny for alleged racial profiling and excessive violence against African-Americans following nationwide protests over several fatal shootings. 

Monday's incident is apparently not the first time Rock has been stopped by police while driving.

Last week, the  father-of-two posted a photo of himself strapped in the back seat of a vehicle on his WhoSay account, alongside the caption: 'I'm not even driving stop by the cops again (sic).'

And on February 13, he uploaded a selfie while sitting in the driver's seat of his car in broad daylight, with a patrol car behind him, telling his followers: 'Just got pulled over by the cops wish me luck.' 

In the image, he was sporting tinted glasses, a flat cap and a gray jacket.

'Wish me luck'L He told his three million Twitter followers: 'Just got pulled over by the cops wish me luck'

Following the latest incident, some social media users were quick to mention one of Rock's famous comedic routine, in which he advises black people 'how not to get your ass kicked by the police'.

In the sketch, which features several black men getting pulled over by police, Rock tells viewers that they probably won't 'get their ass kicked' by police if they 'obey the law' and 'use common sense'.

He also advises them to stop immediately when they see flashing police lights in the mirror, turn off 'loud rap music', choose to give a 'white friend' a ride and avoid travelling with 'a mad woman'. 

Rock, who recently revealed he is working on a follow-up to his acclaimed comedy film, Top Five, filed for divorce from his wife of 19 years, Malaak Compton-Rock, in December last year.

The couple are reportedly worth an estimated $70million. It is unclear how much of the fortune Rock and his wife will each receive in the divorce settlement. The pair have two daughters together.

Earlier this month, a damning US Department of Justice report found that police exhibited racial bias in Ferguson, Missouri, where black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a cop last August.

The 105-page document revealed the city's police department and court system 'reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias', while city officials were found to have 'discriminatory intent'. 

Last November, a grand jury chose not to indict officer Darren Wilson for killing 18-year-old Brown.

Family: On Saturday, Rock was pictured posing on the red carpet at the Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles alongside his wife Malaak Compton-Rock, daughters Lola and Zahra, and the daughter of a family friend
