The U.S. Justice Department announced
charges on Monday against two former federal agents accused of
stealing the digital currency bitcoin during the investigation
of the underground drug marketplace Silk Road.

Carl Force, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
and Shaun Bridges, a special agent with the Secret Service, were
charged in a criminal complaint filed in San Francisco federal
court with offenses including wire fraud and money laundering.

Silk Road was an underground website where people bought
drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoin digital currency. By
the time authorities shut it down in October 2013, Silk Road had
generated around $200 million in sales, prosecutors said.

Authorities said it was operated by Ross Ulbricht, 30, under
the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts.' A federal jury in Manhattan
found Ulbricht guilty in February of charges including
conspiracy to commit drug trafficking and money laundering.

Force, 46, and Bridges, 32, belonged to a Baltimore-based
federal task force investigating the Silk Road. Force had a
prominent role in the probe, authorities said, as he was the
lead undercover agent in communication with Ulbricht.

But prosecutors said while Force spoke with Ulbricht using
an officially sanctioned alias, he also created unauthorized
online personas to communicate with 'Dread Pirate Roberts.'

Using those aliases, Force extorted $250,000 from Ulbricht
and later offered to sell him information about the government's
investigation for $100,000, the complaint said.

Prosecutors said Force also stole $90,000 worth of bitcoins
that Ulbricht paid him in under an officially sanctioned alias
used for the undercover investigation.

Authorities said Bridges, 32, meanwhile diverted to his
personal account over $800,000 worth of bitcoin that he
controlled during the Silk Road investigation.

By the time authorities shut Silk Road down in October 2013, the website had generated around $200 million in sales, prosecutors said. The homepage to Silk Road 2.0, allegedly an underground drug market, is seen in a screenshot after it was closed by U.S. authorities November 6, 2014

Force was arrested in Baltimore on Friday and appeared in
court there on Monday. Bridges surrendered on Monday and was
released after appearing in court in San Francisco.

Joshua Dratel, Ulbricht's lawyer, in a statement on Monday
said that prosecutors only revealed information about the 'monumental scandal' five weeks before trial after keeping the
investigation secret for nine months.

'It is clear from this complaint that fundamentally the
government's investigation of Mr. Ulbricht lacked any integrity,
and was wholly and fatally compromised from the inside,' Dratel
said.

Steven Levin, a lawyer for Bridges, said he maintains his
innocence. Ivan Bates, Force's attorney, did not respond to a
request for comment.

The case is U.S. v. Force, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California, No. 15-mj-70370.
