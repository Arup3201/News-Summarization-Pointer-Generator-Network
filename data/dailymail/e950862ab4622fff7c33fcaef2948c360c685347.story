The British Darts Organisation (BDO) have vowed to investigate vile racist jokes by the man dubbed the voice of BBC darts.

Compere Martin Fitzmaurice - famous for his catchphrase 'Let's play 
darts' - was forced to apologise after he shocked an audience with remarks about Asians and black people.

Controversy: Darts compere Martin Fitzmaurice

Out of order: Fitzmaurice has apologised for his vile remarks

The 73-year-old's offensive comments came when he thought cameras were 
off during a break at the British International between Scotland and England in Fife, Scotland on Sunday.

Among the audience was 14-year-old British Asian prodigy Jordan Singh.

Fitzmaurice told The Sun: 'It was banter. I apologise if I offended anybody.'

Both the BDO and the Scottish Darts Association (SDA) condemned the 'offensive comments'.

In
a statement, the BDO said: 'The British Darts Organisation apologises 
unreservedly for the fact that racially offensive comments were made by 
MC Martin Fitzmaurice at the BDO British Internationals in Scotland on 
Sunday, April 7th and streamed over the internet.

'The
BDO wishes to make it clear that it does not tolerate racism in any 
shape or form, and a full enquiry is already taking place into this 
regrettable incident.

'In
accordance with BDO rules on racism, Martin Fitzmaurice has been made 
fully aware of the seriousness of his actions and will be required to 
face a disciplinary hearing in front of the BDO Board.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'As someone who has appeared in previous 
tournaments we have televised we are appalled by the alleged remarks.'
