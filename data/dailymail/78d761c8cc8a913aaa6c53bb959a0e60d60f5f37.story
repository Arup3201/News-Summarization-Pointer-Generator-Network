It was an art exhibition that no one had expected to see.

But when a blaze struck a £10million London townhouse, these paintings were rescued by quick-thinking firemen – then left propped up against railings on the pavement.

Last night the art world was divided over the worth of the haul, saved from a five-storey property in Wimpole Street, Marylebone, in the early hours of yesterday.

Antiques roadshow: Art experts were divided last night over the worth of the rescued paintings

Real thing: Thames scene by John Atkinson Grimshaw, Britain’s ‘master of moonlight’ oil paintings

Copy? The left painting may be from the school of Victorian era artist Eugene Boudin

The paintings resemble the work of Victorian era artists John Atkinson Grimshaw, Eugene Boudin and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. But others suggested they were merely copies.

An expert on the work of Grimshaw – Britain’s ‘master of moonlight’ oil paintings – suggested two of the canvases could be worth as much as £600,000 if they were proved to be originals dating back to 1880.

Lionised by Victorian society for his delicate studies of twilit landscapes, the Yorkshireman has become one of the Victorian era’s most sought-after artists, with his signature landscapes of rain-washed streets in London and views of northern cities commanding prices of £300,000 to £500,000.

Jane Sellars, curator of the Mercer Gallery in Harrogate, which has housed the largest collection of his works to be shown since 1979, said one of the paintings resembled one of his series of Thames nightfall pictures, and another appeared to be one of his scenes of Piccadilly.

Scores of firefighters saved nine people from a burning mansion in London in the early hours of yesterday

She said: ‘Clearly these paintings belong to a serious collector of Victorian art.

‘One is almost certainly a Grimshaw, one of his harbour scenes, maybe Nightfall On The Thames. Grimshaw painted similar views in Glasgow, Liverpool, Hull, Scarborough, Whitby, London.

‘A second picture could be a Grimshaw, again maybe a London scene.’

She said the two paintings, which could fetch between £250,000 and £300,000 each, were examples of the largest size canvases that he produced for his most dedicated collectors.

Also rescued from the flames was a seaside landscape resembling a ‘Beach Scene’ by Frenchman Eugene Boudin, whose work has sold for in excess of a £1million.

Another salon picture carried out by firemen showing a woman with bare shoulders is said to be from the ‘school of French painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau’.

Firefighters battled to control the fire throughout the morning, retrieving paintings and valuable items 

The fire spread through four floors of the five-storey mansion in Marylebone as crews tried to contain it 

More than nine hours later firefighters were still at the badly damaged site damping down after the fire 

However, Britain’s leading art critic Brian Sewell was sceptical about the provenance of the paintings.

‘These pictures are in terrible frames and look like duds to me, bad production copies of European pictures acquired by the owners of the house,’ he said.

‘I would have said they are worth a few hundred pounds at the most.’

Neighbours said firemen had told them they removed the paintings because the property ‘looked like an art gallery’.

Once the nine occupants of the building had been rescued, the firemen carefully carried out an array of paintings which were left to rest on the railings outside while they continued to damp down the flames.

One resident said she had been woken by a loud bang at 2am and opened her curtains to see smoke and the glow of the blaze. She said: ‘The embers were falling on to the patio and I was stomping them out.

Scores of firefighters worked to evacuated all residents of the mansion in Marylebone in central London 

Nine people were evacuated after the fire - three were assessed for smoke inhalation, but none were injured

Crews used an aerial ladder platform to try and control the blaze as it ripped through the roof of the property

‘The house is quite extravagant. I don’t think the owner is a permanent resident. I think it is a second home. The people who were there might have been staff.’

Yesterday a London Fire Brigade spokesman said it was routine to salvage artwork and items of value when there was no obvious risk to the building and the occupants had been evacuated.

The blaze, which started at around 1.30am, was tackled by more than 70 firemen and ten fire engines. Three people were checked for smoke inhalation, London Ambulance Service said, but no one was injured.

The fire affecting four of the five storeys and the roof was finally brought under control shortly before 6am.

Last night the residents of the townhouse, which is owned by an investment company in the British Virgin Islands, were not available for comment. The cause of the fire is unknown, but police believe it is not suspicious.
