When drivers report their cars stolen - they expect never to see them again.

But for Alex Walden it took just 15 minutes before she was reunited with her stolen car - with  the alleged thief still in the driver’s seat.

Miss Walden was with her boyfriend, Ryan Tippetts,  when they discovered her black Jetta had been taken from the University Hill neighborhood in Boulder, Colorado.

Bizarre: Alex Walden and her boyfriend, Ryan Tippetts, pictured, reported her car stolen but just 15 minutes later it appeared in front of them at an intersection - with the alleged thief at the wheel

But just 15 minutes after contacting police officers, the Jetta reappeared in front of their eyes.

The couple were crossing an intersection when Miss Walden realised the car in front of them - waiting to let them cross the road -  was her own.

So Miss Walden decided to confront the man driving her car.

Speaking to ABCNews.com,  Walden said: 'I asked him what he was doing and he said, "I’m trying to let ya’ll cross the street". He didn’t realize who we were and I told him to get out of my car.'

However, the man allegedly driving the vehicle - former University of Colorado running back Davien Payne, 20, refused.

Mr Tippetts then decided to attempt to recover his girlfriend's vehicle by force.

Police say he dove through the passenger-side window and fought with Payne for control of the steering wheel.

He was left badly injured after being punched in the face and throat about 20 times while attempting  to prevent the moving car from crashing.

Eventually  Payne allegedly got out of the car and attempted to run away but he was captured by police officers. 

Following his fight, Mr Tippetts suffered from a broken larynx and has six titanium plates with screws holding his throat together.

He said: 'I’ve got a bunch of metal in my throat so now I have to worry about going through metal detectors.'

Payne has been charged with aggravated motor vehicle theft, two counts of second-degree assault, resisting arrest, obstructing a police officer and third-degree trespassing.

His next court appearance is on  September 12 in Boulder.
