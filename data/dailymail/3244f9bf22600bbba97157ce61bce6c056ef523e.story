Food fan: Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin 'El CHapo' Guzman, pictured at his February arrest, loved gourmet food and would creep down from his mountain hide out to indulge at elegant restaurants - and pick up the check for the entire establishment in exchange for their silence

A longtime Mexican drug cartel boss loved gourmet food and would creep down from his mountain hide out to indulge at elegant restaurants - and pick up the check for the entire establishment in exchange for their silence.

Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán even managed to buy off prison staff enough to enjoy decadant food while behind bars, throwing  parties for his favored inmates that featured alcohol, lobster bisque, and filet mignon.

The now-captured kingpin also had an insatiable need to pay for sex, according to a fascinating new profile in the New Yorker, despite having a young beauty queen wife.

He would eat Viagra 'like candy' and go visit prostitutes, even having crooked guards bring hookers to his prison cell.

Guzmán was captured at a beach resort in February, just days after he escaped the clutches of police by fleeing through an elaborate series of tunnels near his Culiacan home.

An unnamed D.E.A. official revealed to the New Yorker that Guzman's love of gourmet food was one of his downfalls, and from time to time he indulged his penchant at restaurants in Sinaloa or in a neighboring state.

It was always the same procedure - diners would be startled by a team of gunmen, who would politely demand their cell phones.

Guzman and his entourage would then come in and feast on shrimp and steak.

When done, they would thank the other diners for their playing along, return their cell phones and pick up the tab for everyone before fleeing.

But Guzmán had other weaknesses.

Law enforcement confirmed that Guzmán, had been married at least three times, had traveled in February to Los Cabos for a liaison with a prostitute.

Numerous current and former officials told the New Yorker that Guzmán consumed a vast number of Viagra pills. 'He ate it like candy,' one told the magazine.

D.E.A. agents who monitored his e-mails and texts were amazed that his communications were less about his multimillion dollar drug business but juggling his many women. 'It was a non-stop deal,' a former law-enforcement official who kept track of the communications told the New Yorker.

Even when he was behind bars, he upheld his prominent reputation as a boss and bought off prison staff to enjoyed a life of relative luxury.

According to the New Yorker, he conducted business by cell phone, orchestrated regular visits from prostitutes, and ate fillet steak while other prisoners ate gruel.

In March, a Mexican judge denied Guzman an injunction against any extradition to the United States.

The Federal Judicial Council said in a statement that the judge rejected Guzman's petition because the U.S. government hadn't filed an extradition request. If the U.S. does file a request, Guzman will be free to go back to court to seek an injunction.

Guzman faces organized crime and drug trafficking charges in five different Mexican federal courts.

The Mexican government has said he will not be extradited soon to the U.S., where he has been indicted in several states.

Guzman was arrested after 13 years as a fugitive since escaping from prison. He is being held in Mexico's highest-security prison.

Escape route: As Mexican marines forced their way into his main hideout in Culiacan, Guzman slipped out of through a secret door beneath a bathtub and into this tunnel

Planned: He climbed down a corrugated steel ladder into a network of tunnels and sewer canals that connect to at least seven other houses in Culiacan, officials said

The powerful drug cartel leader employed high-tech communications gadgetry and sophisticated counterespionage practices to elude an international manhunt, The Associated Press learned.

In the end, however, life on the run unraveled for Guzman in a decidedly low-tech way.

A traditional wiretap in southern Arizona pointed authorities to a cellphone being used by a top associate. Within a day, Guzman was captured in a high-rise beachfront condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico.

Guzman's penchant for technology and his efforts to stay ahead of the law were described to the AP by a senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of Guzman's years on the run and by a U.S. government official who was briefed on the case. Both spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation by name.

'He didn't spare any expenses when it came to protecting himself,' the law enforcement official said.Some of the communications equipment Guzman used was not generally available to consumers.

The sophistication of the gear and Guzman's diligence deeply impressed investigators who were pursuing him. Among other practices, Guzman employed countersurveillance scanners to detect transmitters hidden in rooms or carried by people with whom he was meeting.

'It was top-notch,' the law enforcement official said.

Because Guzman was so well protected, he managed to attend family events and marry a local beauty queen in a well-attended bash in his home state of Sinaloa, all while keeping his multinational, billion-dollar drug empire thriving.

U.S. and Mexican officials spent years hunting for a weak spot in his network. The U.S. government official said the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement used traditional wiretaps to zero in on Guzman. At times in the last year, agents were able to intercept BlackBerry messages and other communications.

Identity: Guzman, during the scientific tests to prove his identity on February 26. The Sinaloa Cartel leader was subjected to a buccal swab, a phisiognomic identity study and a test of 10 fingerprints

Earlier in February, authorities raided one of Guzman's suspected hideouts in Culiacan, the capital city of Sinaloa, where Guzman operated with near impunity. Inside, they found a cellphone belonging to his communications chief, which helped lead to a trusted courier, the government official said.

The courier later described for authorities a series of houses Guzman used as hideouts. At least one other arrest pointed Guzman's pursuers to the Pacific Coast city of Mazatlan.

The most important clue came from an ICE wiretap monitored in Nogales, Ariz. That information directed Mexican marines to the exact condominium where Guzman had been hiding since outrunning troops days earlier through interconnected tunnels beneath his Culiacan hideouts.

The officials would not discuss the specific methods used over the last 13 years.

The law enforcement official said Guzman wasn't holed up in the rugged mountains of western Mexico while on the run. With the help of his own trusted security force and the likely assistance of some Mexican authorities, Guzman had moved freely about parts of Mexico and even internationally.

'He moved for the most part with impunity (in Culiacan),' the official said. 'He traveled at will. He had private planes. He was a businessman and he would go and meet people to discuss not just the drug trade. He was obviously interested in the money trade, the markets. He was looking at expanding the empire.'

By the time of his capture, Guzman's empire stretched from Canada through Latin America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia. He is believed to have amassed a fortune worth billions.

U.S. and Mexican authorities were close to nabbing Guzman in the past but arrived at resorts or other locations hours or days too late, the law enforcement official said. They were never closer than in February. Guzman's pursuers were on his heels during raids at the stash houses in Culiacan. The law enforcement official said Guzman was believed to be just ahead of Mexican troops when he vanished in the underground network below the houses before absconding to the high-rise condo in Mazatlan, along the coast.
