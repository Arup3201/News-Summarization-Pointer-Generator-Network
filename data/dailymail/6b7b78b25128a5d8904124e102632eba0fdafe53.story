Jamie Murray is in line for a recall to the British Davis Cup team to partner his brother Andy when they take on the USA in the biggest team match the country has hosted for decades.

The 28-year-old doubles specialist, who has already won a title on the ATP Tour this season, is in pole position to make his first appearance since 2011 when Glasgow hosts the World Group first round tie in early March.

While talking up the prospects of pitting the Murrays against the world champion Bryan brothers, GB Captain Leon Smith also ruled out any prospect of Aljaz Bedene being selected on Tuesday, regardless of his current citizenship application.

The 25-year-old Slovenian, who reached the final of the ATP event in Chennai at the weekend, wants to represent his adopted country and hopes that a nationality switch is imminent.

But Smith made it clear on Tuesday that he is set on having Londoner James Ward as his back up singles player, and is more concerned with who will make up his doubles team for what could well be the pivotal rubber of the tie.

He has five realistic options for the doubles team: the Murray brothers, Davis Cup stalwart Colin Fleming, former Wimbledon champion Jonny Marray and recent British number one Dom Inglot.

Tellingly, though, he pointed to Jamie's decent record against the Bryans when discussing his thoughts for Britain's opening tie in the elite sixteen-team knockout.

'It's very difficult for anyone to play three matches in three days at this level, but without disrespecting anyone the strongest doubles team is Andy and somebody else,' said Smith, in attendance at the Australian Open.

'I've got some very good options but I'd say Jamie has been the strongest player over the last six months, and he has done well in recent matches against the Bryans (two wins alongside Australian John Peers in their last four meetings).'

He acknowledged that Fleming has played well in the Davis Cup previously, but he is sitting out at the Australian Open after the birth of his first child and is likely to be short of matches.

Smith witnessed wins in the qualifying event for both Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, an event that Ward does not need to play in because his ranking of 102 has secured a place in the main draw.

'Wardy has always fought 100 per cent for Britain in the Davis Cup and is improving all the time. 

'Aljaz is a good guy but he's ranked lower than James and I don't see him as an issue for me to consider at the moment.'

Bedene is ranked 116 but highly rated, and he believes he could soon be a British citizen. 

However, even if he comes to represent GB as an individual he would have to launch an appeal process to overcome rules hindering him from playing in major team competitions.

One of Broady, 21, or Edmund, 20, are likely to be the reserve player at the Davis Cup. Broady defeated Uzbek Farrukh Dustov 6-4 6-3 in the qualifying first round while Edmund overcame France's Tristan Lamasine 6-4 6-2.

Smith said that he would like to have been able to consider former British number two Dan Evans, who has not played since the summer after knee problems. 

He revealed that Evans is likely to make his comeback at a Futures level event starting in Sheffield this weekend.
