An ice-cream man has been banned from driving down a street - after he swore at residents who complained about the volume of his van's chimes.

One local in Ripley, Derbyshire, described the sound when David Wilson passed by as 'like having a police car in your living room'.

But the 48-year-old reacted to their complaints by swearing at the neighbours and telling one couple: 'There's nothing you can do about it.'

Certainly not vanilla! One local in Ripley, Derbyshire, described the sound when David Wilson passed by as 'like having a police car in your living room' (file picture)

Wilson, of Derbs, stuck his fingers up at a mother and daughter and called another resident a 'gay boy'.

He was convicted of using threatening words and behaviour after the incident in November last year.

Derby Crown Court fined him £945 and banned him from driving down Bridge Yard Avenue for two years.

The court heard that council staff had taken an 84-decibel reading - about the noise level of a freight train - from inside a house when Wilson drove down the road.

Householder Paul Cooper, who challenged Wilson on the noise, told the court: 'It was like a police car in your living room, it was so loud.

'I asked him to turn the music down. He said there was nothing I could do about it, nothing the police could do about it and nothing the council could do about it.'

Wilson denied swearing at Mr Cooper and his wife, Michelle, and yelling at another resident: 'You've got your gay boy to do your dirty work.'

Robert Sutch, who came out of his home when he heard the shouting, told the court: 'Wilson gave a two-fingered salute to my mother and daughter.'

Wilson was at court to appeal against his conviction, which was imposed last year by magistrates. But Judge Andrew Hamilton, sitting with two magistrates, rejected the appeal.

The court was shown a video of the van going down the street on a later occasion, when there was snow on the ground.

Mr Sutch could be heard saying: 'If that's not a wind-up, I don't know what is.

'Who would want to buy an ice-cream on a cold winter's day? The temperature outside must be zero.'

Wilson told the hearing: 'They are just trying to get me off the estate.

'I didn't swear at him. It's not the thing to do in an ice-cream van, is it?'

He denied making rude signs but agreed Mr Cooper appeared annoyed by the van's music.

'I said "there's not a lot you can do about it,", added Wilson. 'He said "yes, there is and I will get it sorted." Then he said he was going to ring the police.

'I am driving off and you have got Mr Cooper, his neighbour and some children standing there just grinning.'

But Judge Hamilton said he and the magistrates accepted the residents' view of the incident.

He added: 'We appreciate that there may be some ulterior motive but we take the view that Mr and Mrs Cooper are honest people who would not stoop to fabricate evidence.'
