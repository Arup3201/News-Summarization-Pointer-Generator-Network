The deadly fire at a Annapolis mansion that killed a couple and their four grandchildren was caused by a 15-foot dry Christmas tree,  investigators revealed today. 

An electrical failure in the mansion's 'Great Room' which was connected to the sleeping and living areas sparked the January 19 blaze which was fueled by the tree.

Technology executive Don Pyle, his wife, Sandra, and their four grandchildren were killed after the fire swept through their $9million 16,000-square-foot mansion.

Anne Arundel County Fire officials said the Christmas tree had been cut down more than 60 days before the fire and investigators said they believe the Pyles lit their tree 'most of the time'. 

They had gathered around the tree on Christmas Day.  

Investigators would not reveal where the bodies were found out of respect for the family, but they said they were sleeping when the fire started. They also did not confirm if they died from smoke inhalation.

They said smoke detectors in the house were working, but added sprinklers would have helped 'without a doubt' but the home did not have them because it was built in 2005,  four years before Anne Arundel began to require them in new residential homes.

ATF agent Bill McMullan said the fire was 'a tragic accident that occurred at the worst possible time'.

The family issued a statement to the media on the cause of the fire late on Tuesday evening.

'While the explanation that has been shared with us today does not bring solace, it does start us down the long road to acceptance,' said the statement.

'We continue to express our sincere gratitude to the Anne Arundel County Fire Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Anne Arundel County Crisis Response System, and all other assisting departments. 

'The brave members of these organizations have faced dangerous conditions and heart-breaking discoveries, but they have repeatedly amazed us with their professionalism, respect for our family, and dedication to their work. We are grateful for their heroic efforts. 

It went onto say, 'It is our hope that each of you are strengthened in your resolve to cherish your family, friends, and good times. With life so fleeting, make every day and every moment a special time with those you love. We believe that life is about making memories. As we work through our pain and loss, the memories we made with our family will sustain us.

'We ask for continued respect of our need for time and privacy as we struggle to begin healing.'

 'Our love for our family is boundless,' the statement said. 'Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.'

The post went on: 'And of course Don and Sandy 'Dee Dee and Pop Pop' the two most incredible, generous, hilarious people anyone could ever know. I am thankful for the 16 years I had with them too, as I'm sure everyone else who had the pleasure of knowing them is as well.

According to The Baltimore Sun, Randy and Stacey Boone, parents of Lexi and Katie, have a three-week-old son who was not at the Pyles' home on the night of the tragedy.

An earlier family statement given to WUSA9 read: 'On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need.
