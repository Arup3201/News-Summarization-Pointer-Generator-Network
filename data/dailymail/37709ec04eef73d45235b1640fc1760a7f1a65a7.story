A who's who of Australia's top actors, musicians, media personalities, sport legends and business identities have come together to take a stand against refugee children being held in detention.

Most of the prominent 37 Aussies are not known for holding a tune but they didn't stop them from singing from the heart when they recorded they song 'We're better than this.'

Veteran actor Bryan Brown came up with the idea for a song after speaking with well-known friends who wanted to join the campaign to put a stop to refugee children being locked in detention facilities both on and off Australian shores.

'It's too easy to sit around and talk about things and you sort of have to get off your bum and do stuff. This is appalling how these children are being treated, ' Brown told the ABC.

Brown said he received an overwhelming response after sending about 100 emails to well-known identities who were keen to a be a part of Live Aid's 'We Are The World type video'. 

Some of the big names include actors Claudia Karvan, Rebecca Gibney and Deborah Mailman as well as musicians - John Williamson, Glenn Shorrock and Mahalia Barnes.

'Do we want future citizens of Australia to start their lives like this?' asked Karvan, who has two children fo her own and a step-child, in the video.

Former Wallabies captain George Gregan, who is joined in the video by fellow sporting legend, former Australian cricket captain Ian Chappell, said: 'Looking after kids is so important because they grow into adults and it gets passed on, so no, we are not looking after them properly.' 

Journalist, Ita Buttrose,  who is joined by peers Andrew Denton and his wife Jennifer Byrne in the campaign, said the conditions were robbing the young peoples of a childhood.

'When you lock a child up you lock up their imagination and when you do that you destroy the childhood,' she said

Brown admits that although he doesn't have the answers - the government needs to find the solution adding that many people in the video were asking: 'How did we get here? How did we think this is alright?' 

603 children are locked in immigration detention facilities

459 of them are on the Australian mainland and 144 on Christmas Island

186 children are detained on Nauru and will never be settled in Australia, even if found to be refugees

413 days is the current average length of detention in Australia for adults and children

'I find it deeply depressing to think that a country that I have a lot of pride in can actually think that this is alright how we look after children, by putting them behind barbed wire where children are self-harming,' he said.  

The father-of-three said he was appalled that there are currently over 700 children being held on both the mainland and off-shore facilities at the behest of the Australian Government and the average length of time spent by both children and adults is more than 400 days.

'There are many Australians who are appalled by this and that's where the idea to start this real people movement came from,' he said in a statement.

'We're just all Australians who want both sides of politics to hear us when we say we believe we can do better than we are currently doing when it comes to managing kids seeking refuge.'

The song and video is part of campaign by new non-profit movement We’re Better Than This, with proceeds going towards the campaign.
