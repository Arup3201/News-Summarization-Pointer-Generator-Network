He may be one of the most recognisable faces in Qatar, but Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani certainly had issues with New York real estate - until now.

The sheikh has reportedly purchased an exclusive Manhattan townhouse after dishing out $47million.

Located at 22 E. 71st Street, the property was previously owned by real estate magnate Aby Rosen, the co-founder and president of RFR Holdings.

Lavish: A living room in the townhouse comes complete with a dining area

The 21,000-square-foot mansion boasts five floors, a reception hall, and a jacuzzi, according to property listings.

The New York Post reported that while Rosen was known to host extravagant parties at the property, he never actually lived there.

The super-secret deal was reportedly done without a broker to keep the sheikh's name from getting out.

A source told the Post: 'The house has been purchased through an LLC, Tower Management Holdings, to protect the identity of the buyer, Sheik Hamad, who has been looking to purchase a New York property.'

Posh: The house also has an incredible marble staircase and plenty of living space

It was reported last month that al-Thani
 had his eyes on a nearly $100million 10,923 square foot penthouse in 
the exclusive One57 building, the Big Apple's most expensive.

The astronomical fee of the penthouse apartment eclipsed the 
$88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a 
penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

But the Post reported that the sheikh's deal was called off by al-Thani himself because he felt the building's two elevators were not enough for his two wives, 15 kids and entourage of handlers and armed guards.

He was also reportedly in discussions about 
buying four separate, full-floor condos in the exclusive Midtown 
building, which would bring the total cost to an incredible $250million.

The penthouse, on the 89th and 90th 
floors, boasts a ‘grand salon’, at least five bedrooms, four fireplaces,
 floor-to-ceiling windows and a large mezzanine, the Post 
reported.

As well as staggering views over the Manhattan skyline and beyond, the property also features impressive 23-foot ceilings.

Al-Thani expressed interest in the Midtown penthouse after his bid for two Fifth Avenue apartments owned by the famously reclusive and recently deceased Huguette Clark, was rejected.

Rejected: Al-Thani initially hoped to buy a couple of Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the late copper heiress Huguette Clark, for $31.5 million but his bid was rejected by the co-op board

Despite offering $500,000 more than the asking price, the powerful PM’s bid 
was refused with the building's co-op board - who refused to even grant the 
sheikh an interview.

It is thought the board stonewalled his offer after it was revealed he planned to knock the two eight floor apartments into one.

It was also reported that al-Thani's huge family - 
and the entourage of staff who travel with them - also caused concerns 
for the co-op board.

Other reasons cited for the rejection 
were concerns about where his money was coming from and the fact that 
the Sheikh is a foreign head of state with diplomatic immunity.
