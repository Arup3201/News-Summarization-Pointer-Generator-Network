A Marine made the ultimate sacrifice as he pulled his college friend to safety after a small plane crash in Kansas that killed two others on their way to a Christian youth retreat.

Hannah Luce, 22, a fourth recent graduate of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, survived the Cessna crash on Friday evening, just northwest of Chanute, after escaping the burning plane with the help of Austin Anderson, a 27-year-old former Marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq.

Hospitalised in serious but stable condition, Ms Luce of Golden Valley, Texas, fled to a nearby road with Mr Anderson, of Ringwood, Oklahoma, who later succumbed to his injuries.

Survivor: Hannah Luce, 22, is the lone survivor of a plane crash Friday in Kansas that killed four other passengers, three of which had just graduated one week ago

Hero: Former Marine Austin Anderson, 27, who graduated from ORU last week, died from his injuries Saturday after helping Ms Luce escape the burning plane to a road for help

Mr Anderson attended ORU after serving in Iraq, according to fellow graduate and friend Brooke Ninowski, 
was among the three other passengers who graduated from the university 
last Saturday.

The Kansas Highway Patrol identifies 
the other fatalities as 23-year-old Luke Sheets of Ephraim, Wisconsin, who 
was flying the plane; 29-year-old Garrett Coble of Tulsa, Oklahoma; and 
22-year-old Stephen Luth of Muscatine, Iowa. Mr Coble was a former business instructor at ORU.

According to a friend of Mr Anderson, speaking to NewsOn6, it was Mr Anderson who pulled Ms Luce from the burning plane.

According to National Transportation 
Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson, the eight-seat plane from Tulsa 
lost contact with air traffic control shortly after getting permission 
to descend to a lower altitude.

Crash: The plane (left) skidded 200 feet through a field before colliding with a line of trees and catching fire, killing three of its five passengers Friday evening

Pilot: Mr Sheets was the son of a former Air Force pilot who now flies commercial jets

Graduation: Mr Luth, right, seen during his graduation ceremony one week ago

Bad feeling: Mr Coble's fiancee, pictured beside him, narrowly flew with him Friday but chose to drive after her father told her he had a bad feeling about it

The plane then skilled 200ft, according to Fox23, colliding with a line of trees before spinning 180 degrees and catching fire.

The NTSB is currently investigating the cause of the crash.

It was just last Saturday Mr Anderson, Mr Sheets and Mr Luth graduated from ORU, a Christian University, the university President Mark Rutland said in a statement.

Teen Mania Ministries, which organised the Acquire the Fire Christian youth rally the group was heading to in Council Bluffs, Iowa, said in a statement Saturday that both Mr Austin and Mr Stephen were recently hired to join their marketing team.

Recovery: Ms Luce, pictured right, is currently in serious condition with burns over 28 percent of her body

Studies: She graduated from Oral Roberts last year with a theology degree and was working on her master's degree in counseling psychology at Oklahoma State University

Ms Ninowski said she had been friends with Mr Anderson 
for about two years - he was her brother's roommate for a semester - and had interviewed him for a video profile after his return from Iraq. She 
said they also had a few classes together.

Ms Ninowski said she also knew Mr Luth and Mr Sheets through school, noting that Mr Luth had dated one of her best friends.

'They were guys who stuck to their 
morals and it showed through their character, and how they treated 
people,' she said. 'They thought of others first.

'I don't know if the 
reports are true about Austin, that he might have pulled Hannah out of 
the wreckage, but that wouldn't surprise me in any way.'

Flight path: The group was flying from Oklahoma to the Acquire the Fire Christian youth rally in Iowa when their plane went down

Mr Sheets, who was piloting the plane, is the son of a commercial airline pilot who would often spend his Friday afternoon's making medical support flights, Tulsa World reports.

'He was just a wonderful young man, God-fearing man, it's a terrible loss,' said Bill Austin, a Tennessee plane dealer speaking to Fox23.

He said he sold the Cessna the group was flying in a few weeks ago to an undisclosed buyer, but noted it not having any prior problems to his knowledge.

'Please pray that God surrounds the families of Austin, Stephen, Luke and Garrett with His love and peace in this extremely difficult time,' a statement by Teen Mania Ministries read Saturday.
