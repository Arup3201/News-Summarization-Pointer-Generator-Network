The road network of the United States is one of the largest human constructions on earth and consists of more than four million miles of mapped roads, plus additional utility roads, four-wheel-drive trails and private routes.

This map, created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), shows the areas of the mainland where those roads are most densely populated and also those area where they are a lot more scarce.

Roads were the backbone of America’s great growth and expansion during the 20th century, helping transport raw materials, processed goods and people across vast distances of the 48 states that make up the continental United States.

This map was created by the United States Geological Survey, the yellow areas show the parts of the country where roads are most densely populated, while green shows the areas with fewest access

According to the USGS, documented roads and their rights-of-way now occupy approximately one percent of the land area of the U.S., roughly the size of South Carolina.

This map, which was compiled by the USGS in 2005, splits the mainland into 1km squared cells and then colors each cell depending on the distance to the nearest road. The conterminous 48 states are comprised of some 7.5 million cells.

Those areas of highest road density are colored yellow and on the map typically represent the country’s larger urban centers, although some yellow areas are also around energy extraction activities such as the oil and gas fields of West Texas and the Texas Panhandle.

Areas of moderately high road density are colored blue and these are typically areas where terrain and vegetation made it possible to built roads and  there was also a motivation - farming - for making land accessible.

Blue areas occur in all states and are particularly prominent across the Great Plains, in the Central and Imperial Valleys of California and to the west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. The Atlantic Seaboard, outside of cities, is also shaded this color.

Low road density area are shaded turquoise such as the valleys and ridges of the Appalachian Mountains. Other areas with few roads are the arid lands of the West, from the sand hills of Nebraska to the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and southeastern California. With agricultural productivity low there was also little motivation for building a dense network of roads.

Green represents areas remote from roads such as the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, the swamps of southern Florida and Louisiana and areas with extreme climates such as northern Maine and Minnesota.

'Roads are the circulatory system of our culture. They are used to bring raw materials to processing sites, to distribute processed goods, and to carry people to their schools, workplaces, jobs and friends,’ writes Raymond Watts of the USGS Fort Collins Science Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, who helped to create the map.
