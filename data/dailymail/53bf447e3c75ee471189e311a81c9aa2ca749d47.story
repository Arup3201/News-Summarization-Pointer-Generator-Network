Authorities said they will drop the last remaining charge against a Detroit police officer who shot and killed a 7-year-old girl during a during a nighttime raid after two trials ended without convictions.

Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy will move Friday to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Joseph Weekley, who shot and killed Aiyana Stanley-Jones while she slept in 2010. 

Police were accompanied by a camera crew for the show 'The First 48' on A&E when Weekley burst into the home and fired one shot from his submachine gun that struck Aiyana in the head.

Weekley was indicted in 2011 on a charge of involuntary manslaughter charge for the shooting, which authorities believe was unintentional. 

The first trial ended without a verdict in June 2013. His second ended in October with a hung jury. During the second trial, a judge dismissed a charge of involuntary manslaughter.

Worthy called it 'unfortunate' that Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway dismissed the felony manslaughter charge, leaving only the misdemeanor count, which carries a two-year maximum sentence. 

'Under the law, her decision cannot be appealed,' Worthy said in a statement.

Aiyana's grandmother, Mertilla Jones, said in a statement Wednesday that 'it feels like the system' failed their family.

Jones called Gray Hathaway's dismissal of the manslaughter charge 'even more insidious, given the fact that a 7-year-old child was killed while she was sleeping.'

Victim: Police claimed Aiyana Stanley-Jones's grandmother struggled with Weekley, leading to the fatal shot, though her grandmother denies a struggle took place

Haunted: Though he did not testify in either trial, Weekley has said he is 'haunted' by the raid, which a high-ranking official in the Detroit Police Department said broke protocol

Weekley's attorney, Steve Fishman, said the prosecutor's decision was 'courageous' and 'a correct one.'

Weekley has said he feels 'haunted' by the tragedy. His was supposed to be an elite police unit, but a high-ranking Detroit police official told Mother Jones the raid broke protocol and that officers 'went Hollywood.' 

Officers were after Chauncey Owens, who an informant said was to blame for the murder of 17-year-old Je'Rean Blake Nobles days before.

Instead they stormed the apartment where Charles Jones and his family were. Jones was later found guilty of second-degree murder in Je'Rean's death for providing the gun Owens used to shoot him, the Detroit Free Press reports.

During the raid, Weekley's submachine gun fired seconds after a stun grenade was thrown through a window.

He didn't testify but insisted that he mistakenly pulled the trigger during a struggle with Aiyana's grandmother, who denies she struggled with the officer.

Ron Scott, a spokesman for Aiyana's family and founder of the Detroit Coalition against Police Brutality, said they will push the federal government to seek civil rights charges in the case.

'This kind of blatant disregard and militarization that destroys human life, we have to stop it and send a message that it will not be tolerated, especially in the lives of young black people,' Scott said.
