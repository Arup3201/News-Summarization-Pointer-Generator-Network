Glenn Hoddle may not have known it, but the former Tottenham and England star has been immortalised in new Holloywood film The Imitation Game.

The film, which depicts Alan Turing's code-breaking skills at Bletchley Park during World War II, pays tribute to Hoddle in the form of a personalised number plate.

The moment is brief, but as a military vehicle speeds across the screen, a 'Hod 75' number plate can clearly be seen which is a nod to Hoddle's Spurs debut in 1975.

A member of the film's crew said: 'There’s a military vehicle that appears briefly in the middle of the film with the numberplate HOD 75,’ says my man with the clapperboard.

‘It’s a reference to Glenn Hoddle, who made his debut for Spurs in 1975. A member of the film’s art department is a big Tottenham fan.’

It's still unclear as to whether the film's co-stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley spotted the Hoddle tribute.

Pirates of the Caribbean beauty Knightley is a huge West Ham fan while Cumberbatch follows Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal.

Hoddle scored 110 goals in 490 first team matches in all competitions during his time at Tottenham
