The families of Thailand murder victims Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have been invited to help secure death sentences for the suspects despite widespread doubts over whether police have caught the real killers.

Justice officials said the grieving parents can team up with prosecutors to file joint murder charges against two Burmese migrant workers accused of the brutal killings of the  backpackers on a Thai beach.

The quirk of Thai law means murder victims’ families can hire lawyers and investigators who could turn up additional evidence or testimony.

However, such cases are rare because of the hefty costs.

The offer was made by the prosecutor in charge of the case, Thawatchai Siangjaew, who said he had arranged a video conference via the British embassy in Thailand to ‘inform the victims’ parents of their legal rights’.

Winning the families’ support would lend credibility to the heavily criticised police case against Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, who say they were tortured into confessing.

The pair, who admit they were drinking beer and playing guitar near the murder scene on Koh Tao island on the night of the September 15 killings, could be sentenced to die by lethal injection if they are convicted. 

British police are preparing to fly out to the island and are expected to focus on securing independent checks on the DNA samples of the two suspects.

Meanwhile, there is mounting scepticism over the guilt of the suspects among fellow workers.

Construction worker Win Tun Tun, 40, who shared a room with Zaw Lin, said he was convinced his friend was innocent.

He said: ‘I saw him the morning after the murders and he was perfectly normal. I can’t believe he is involved.’

Other colleagues said they were convinced the pair had been framed to cover for the real killers, who they suspect are Thais connected to the island’s controlling families.
