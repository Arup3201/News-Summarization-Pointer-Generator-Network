A replica House of Commons in which Meryl Streep starred as Margaret Thatcher is up for grabs on eBay.

And the courtroom and prison from The Bill are also going under the hammer.

The iconic film sets graced by Anthony Hopkins, Jude Law, Rachel Weiz, Ed Sheeran and many others are being sold off by Wimbledon Studios, in south west London.

The set for sale on eBay was used in the 2011 film The Iron Lady with Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher

The 5,000 sq ft House of Commons set was created in 1986 for the Granada TV series First Among Equals

The sets were put up for auction on eBay by Wimbledon Studios with bidding starting at the low price of 99p

They blame a lack of space and their rapid expansion for the sale of the sets, with bidding starting at just 99p. Tonight bidding had leapt from £62 to an astounding £120,200.

The 5,000 sq ft House of Commons set was created in 1986 for the Granada TV series First Among Equals.

It was later bought by writer Paul Abbot who wrote BBC drama State of Play, before being bought by Wimbledon Studios. 

The set was designed to be an exact 
replica of the real House of Commons with similar materials and wood 
carvings used to make it as authentic as possible.

The 1,000ft courtroom from The Bill was more recently TV comedy shows This is Jinsy and Dead Boss

The set is described as being a
one-to-one scale replica of the House of Commons.

When fully erected, 
the set is approx 5,000 sq ft but it can be 
housed within a 2,500 sq ft warehouse when disassembled.

It was used by Meryl Streep in the 2011 blockbuster, The Iron Lady.

It was originally built for 1986 series First Among Equals at Granada in Manchester And regularly appeared in shows such as The New Statesman between 1987 and 1992.

Paul Abbott, a former Granada
scriptwriter, bought the set to save it from destruction and stored it in 
an Oxfordshire barn after it ceased being used for State of Play.

In its eBay advert Wimbledon Studios adds that with clever 
dressing the set can be made to look like the House of Lords, by replacing green 
benches with red ones.

Meryl Streep used the set in 2011 to film parts of the international blockbuster The Iron Lady.

The prison set has welcomed Hollywood stars Anthony Hopkins, Jude Law and Rachel Weiz who filmed scenes there for 2011 film 360.

Dizzee Rascal, Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran have also spent time filming music videos on set.

The 1,000ft courtroom was frequently used in the long running iconic cop drama The Bill and more recently TV comedy shows This is Jinsy and Dead Boss.

Piers Read, managing director at the studios, said: 'Selling the sets cements our new future as an exclusive hub for creativity in South West London.

'High demand and upcoming productions require more floor space currently being taken up storing the House of Commons, Courtroom and Prison sets.

'While it will be sad to see such 
iconic creations go, our clients need the extra space to deliver their 
productions on time, so we need to make changes to accommodate their 
needs.'

The auction will end on March 22 at 5pm and is collection only.
