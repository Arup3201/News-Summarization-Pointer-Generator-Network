A terrified shopkeeper ran for cover after a flock of sheep stampeded into her Dutch shoe shop and caused chaos.

Bieke Tjon, 38, was left speechless when the sheep ran into the store entrance and two them decided to run after her.

The incident happened when the flock were being herded to the centre of Barneveld, a town in the central Netherlands, where they were due to be used in an exhibition of sheep shearing skills to locals.

The shepherd had also arranged for some lambs to be there to create a mini petting zoo for children, but the sheep had other ideas.

When the shepherd was not nearby they took a wrong turn and ended up running down the passageway leading to the shoe shop, with two of the animals then running inside.

Ms Tjon told local media that it was the last thing she had expected and as a result she had run off, hiding behind a customer as the curious sheep ran around the store.

The pair soon quickly decided that perhaps it was better to be back outside with the rest of the flock and scarpered.

Ms Tjon said: 'I was really startled, I saw the sheep and then the others behind it, and my first thought was to get away.'

The image captured on a CCTV camera shows the sheep running around the store before giving a male shop worker, who went to try and catch it, the slip.
