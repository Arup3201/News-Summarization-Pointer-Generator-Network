He may have staked a claim to become the next Manchester United captain with some starring performances during the club's pre-season tour of the United States, but there's no place like home for Wayne Rooney.

The England international posted a picture of himself and wife Colleen on his Instagram account accompanied by the caption: 'Nice to be back home with the family'.

United remained unbeaten during their overseas tour against the likes of Real Madrid, Roma, Inter Milan and arch rivals Liverpool to win the Guiness International Champions Cup, giving Rooney reasons to be optimistic about the Premier League season.
