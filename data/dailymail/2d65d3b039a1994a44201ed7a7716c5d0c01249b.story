A leading happiness researcher has claimed that playful dolphins parents are a better model for parents than take-no-prisoners tigers.

Shawn Archor. who teaches at Wharton School of Business, believes that the dolphin's combination of sociability
and playfulness makes kids smarter and happier than criticism, the New York Daily News reports.

Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom author Amy Chan famously advocated no
TV and no tolerance for grades below 'A' in her 2011 bestseller.

But Mr Archor believes that building a positive mental state is the real key to a child's success.

'Most companies and schools follow this formula: if you work harder, you 
will be more successful, and then you will be happy,' he writes. 'This formula is 
scientifically backward.'

Instead, he believes that parents should focus on first building positive psychology for their kids so that success will follow.

His research has been validated by a 
study in the Asian American Journal of Psychology, which showed that a 
tiger parenting profile was associated with lower GPA and less of a sense of family obligation that children who had supportive parents.

Another study shows that tiger kids also face more academic pressure, more depressive symptoms, and a greater 
sense of alienation.

Mr Archor believes in making learning fun.

So rather than waiting to reward a kid for finishing his homework, for example, he recommends letting him wear his favorite 
pajamas while he studies.

He also suggests modeling optimism to 
children by aiming for a ratio of five positive interactions to every 
negative one.

Mr Archor says that being positive isn't about being delusional.

He suggests using 'rational optimism' to examine multiple options and navigate among them to pick the best.

When facing challenges, he says that reminding them of past achievements - such as giving them a trophy before a competition -  can help them stay positive and focused. 

And instead of being overly harsh, he recommends setting kids up for success.

So, he says, a parent who wants her child to exercise more should hide the remote and put  her in sneakers so she's ready 
to get moving. 

He believes that parents should consciously working at being happier.

'While it takes more cognitive processing to be happier, the more that 
you do these positive habits, the more that you switch your default,' he says.
