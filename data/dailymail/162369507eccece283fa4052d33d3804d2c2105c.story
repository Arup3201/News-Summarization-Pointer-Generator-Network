One of the Real Housewives of Miami and her plastic-surgeon husband recently won the right to tear down their historic 1920s mansion, and they spared no time getting on with the demolition.

Photos show an excavator razing the beatuiful white spanish-style estate on Tuesday, after years of legal battles with local preservationists.

Leonard Hochstein is a local pastic surgeon who calls himself the 'Boob God' and his stay-at-home wife Lisa, 31, has starred on the Real Housewives since its second season in 2012.

Lisa marked the momentous occasion by sending out a victorious tweet to her 109,000 followers on Twitter, writing: 'I just took the first major chunk out of our star island home in my High heels, I can do anything in heels lol #demolision #bubbye'

The Hochsteins purchased the 1925 home as a forecloser in late 2012, paying less than $8million for the property.

It was built by Walter deGarmo, Florida's first registered architect.

In its place, the Hochsteins will be rebuilding a 20,000-square-foot mega-mansion complete with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a home theater, a game room, a wine cellar, five-car garage and a guest house.

When local preservationsts found out about the plan, they initially tried to block it by petitioning that the home be historically designated.

The move by the Miami Preservation League was eventually thrown out and now the Hochsteins are allowed to start construction on their new home.

Tear-downs have been on the rise in Miami Beach with 53 demolition applications filed between 2012 and 2013. That's more than the seven years combined when there were just 21 applications total.

Some homeowners are tearing down their beach-front homes because they lie below the federal flood plain, meaning they have to pay extremely high insurance rates.

Another reason is that the land value is often worth much more than the homes itself.

For example, the Hochstein's home was valued at $1.2million while the land it lays on is $8.3million.

In an interview with the Miami Herald in December 2012, Leanard Hochstein explained why he was tearing down the historic home to make way for something new.

'I'm not trying to make this home a museum,' he said. 'I'm trying to make a home for my family.'Â
