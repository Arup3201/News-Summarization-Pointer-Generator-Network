Not so happy families: Julie Depardieu has launched a ferocious attack on her father

The daughter of Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu has had plastic surgery on her nose five times because she could not bear to look like her ‘hoodlum father’, she admitted yesterday.

In a ferocious attack on the French actor, who turns 65 this month, Julie Depardieu added that he had little hope of living beyond the age of 70.

Miss Depardieu, 40, said she continually called in plastic surgeons because she had inherited her father’s trademark nose and wanted to be less recognisable.

She told French newspaper Le Monde: ‘I had five nose jobs because I couldn’t stand myself. It was a question of identity. It was not even to be pretty.

‘I didn’t want to have that nose, because it resembled someone in my family.’

Miss Depardieu is an award-winning film actress in her own right, having starred in a number of films, including La Petite Lili, for which she won a Cesar – the French equivalent of an Oscar – for Best Supporting Actress.

She was also nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Cesar in 2005 for her performance in Podium.

But her father became a household name in Britain and America after starring in hit films including Jean de Florette, Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac.

Miss Depardieu said: ‘He won’t grow much older – 65 years – it’s not old. And when you know what he does, he won’t last. In five years’ time, he won’t be around. He’s the next on the list, I know it.’

The actress, who has two sons – Billy, two, and Alfred, one – added: ‘My father is a hoodlum. He says one thing, he does another. You have to be wary of him.

The actor took Russian citizenship earlier this year to avoid paying increasing high taxes in Paris

‘He’s not a traitor but you have to be wary anyway.’

Gerard
 Depardieu’s reputation in France took a severe dent earlier this year 
when he took Russian citizenship to avoid paying taxes in Paris. He was 
also fined the equivalent of £3,800 earlier this year for drink-driving 
on his scooter in the French capital. 

Depardieu had two children with Elisabeth Guignot, the French actress to whom he was married between 1970 and 2006.

His daughter said her family had never been a very close one, saying that at Christmas ‘everyone argues with each other’.

‘Often
 we don’t even open the presents because everyone has already got up 
from the table,’ she said. Miss Depardieu added that it had been 
difficult for her and her late brother Guillaume to grow up in their 
father’s shadow.

‘He’s a guy who is always going off somewhere else and who explains to you that he can’t stay around.

‘He’s got a handicap, in fact, because he’s someone who cannot stay in the same place.’

Depardieu, who has made more than 150 films, wrote an open letter to France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last year explaining why he was leaving his native country.

He wrote: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’

He
 said he paid 85 per cent of his income to the Government last year, and
 estimated that he had paid more than £130 million in total since he 
started work on leaving school aged 14.

Career: The 40-year-old presenting new film 'The Witnesses' at the 57th International Film Festival in Berlin in 2007

In August, the actor said he considered himself a 'citizen of the world' after a Belgium town made him an honorary citizen.

To celebrate, he invited 200 guests to a barbeque at his house in Nechin, just one kilometre from the border with France.

The ceremony was held at the Chateau Bourgogne where he was made an honorary citizen of Estaimpuis municipality, which includes the village.

In 1998 the actor was involved in a motorcycle crash when his blood-alcohol level was five times over the legal limit. He escaped with leg and face injuries.
