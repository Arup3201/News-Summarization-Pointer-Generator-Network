Five women's lacrosse players at the University of Maryland Baltimore County have been suspended indefinitely after being accused of threatening freshman teammates in text messages.

The messages, exchanged using the GroupMe app, included threats to maim and 'kill' their freshmen teammates and 'take down the coaches.'

Mackenzie Reese, 19, Alyssa Semones, 21, Amber Kovalick, 19, Meghan Milani, 19, and Brittany Marquess, 20 have been suspended, with no timetable for their return.

The Baltimore Post-Examiner received an anonymous email on Friday that contained 16 pages of text screenshots capturing the alleged messages that appeared under the heading 'Sophmores rule.'

The messages weren't sent to the freshmen, but exchanged between the senior girls who expressed their hatred for their new teammates.

In one text, a player asked if she can just threaten the freshmen and not haze them. That triggered the response from another player, 'Can we just kill them?'

To which another replied, 'I'll pitch in.'

'We wanted to make sure you were aware of the extreme situation at UMBC concerning the women's lacrosse team,' the email signed by 'Seeking Justice' said. 

'It is an appalling situation of a jealous older group threatening and carrying out threats of harm against the freshman class.'

UMBC athletic director Tim Hall did not discuss specifics of the texts in an interview on Monday, but he said the school has taken steps to protect the team's freshmen.

The university did not directly attribute the suspensions to these accusations, saying only that the five players were suspended 'for violation of team rules.'

'The athletic director and other university leaders are following all applicable policies and practices as we work to fully understand the situation and support our student athletes,' the statement said.

The players were suspended nearly an hour before their Wednesday game against Drexel but were allowed to sit in the bleachers, where parents said they applauded as their freshman teammates were knocked to the ground. 

One of the co-head coaches, Tony Giro, refused to attend the Drexel game unless the administration removed the players accused of threatening the freshmen from the team. Co-head coach Amy Appelt coached the players.

The players have already missed two games - last Wednesday against Drexel and Saturday against Manhattan. The Retrievers won both games and are 5-3 this season.
