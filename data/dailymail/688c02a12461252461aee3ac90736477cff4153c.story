Arrest: Lindsey Ann Radomski, 32, allegedly let seven juveniles fondle her breasts at a party

A yoga teacher with new breast implants flashed them at guests at a bar mitzvah and let underage boys fondle them before performing a sex act on a 15-year-old boy, police have said.

Lindsey Ann Radomski, 32, told police in Scottsdale, Arizona that she was too drunk to remember what happened at the party on Saturday night.

She was among 80 to 100 guests at the party when she allegedly exposed her new breasts to five adults and they told her to 'sleep it off', Sergeant Ben Hoster told The Arizona Republic.

She then went to a pool area, where she flashed juveniles, police said.

In the early hours of Sunday morning, while most of the guests were asleep or had gone home, she allegedly invited seven boys, aged 11 to 15, into a bedroom and let them fondle her breasts.

When all of the children apart from a 15-year-old boy had left, she performed a sex act on him, the teenager told police.

The victim's parents learned of the encounter and went to the police, Hoster said.

Radomski, who teaches yoga in the Scottsdale area, was interviewed on Tuesday. She told authorities that she had been too drunk to remember the incident but did admit to flashing.

But she arrested and booked on multiple sexual abuse, sexual conduct with a minor and indecent exposure charges.

Bond was set at $10,000 at Radomski's initial court appearance on Wednesday.
