Giving away your daughter is a poignant moment for any father of the bride but usually that is where their duties in the ceremony end.

But not for this father, who after walking his daughter down the aisle, slipped on his robes, stepped up to the altar and conducted the service.

Vicar Ian Bentley happily combined his roles as father and priest to marry his daughter Hannah, 21, and her sweetheart Sam Betts, 25, at St Mark’s Church in Oulton Broad, near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

The vicar, whose daughter was born premature weighing just 4lb, said: ‘I’m not overly emotional but our father and daughter relationship is quite strong, especially as she was premature so I’ve been quite protective.

‘The service is powerful and all couples mean what they say.

‘But they are two committed Christian 
people making their vows before God and they really mean it, making the 
power of their words even stronger.’

Father and daughter: Mr Bentley said his bond with his daughter is strong and he is protective of her because she was born premature weighing just 4lbs

The newlywed bride, who is now in Egypt for her honeymoon, said she was happy her father agreed to help her tie the knot.

The now Mrs Betts said: ‘I asked a few years ago if he would.

‘But he said he didn’t want to, he just wanted to be my dad but when I got engaged last year he liked the idea and I’m glad he did.’

I do: It took some convincing her father that he should be the one to marry her and Mr Betts but after she got engaged last year Mr Bentley decided he liked the idea
