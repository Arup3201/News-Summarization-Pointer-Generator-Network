Their ill-fated polar expedition became known as one of the most doomed in history.

However, a
 century after Captain Robert Scott and much of his Terra Nova crew perished in
 a South Pole blizzard, details have emerged of how other explorers on his team survived for months by eating penguin meat and seal 
blubber.

A little-known account has emerged of how six of the Terra Nova's stranded explorers lived for seven months in an Antarctic ice cave, until they were strong enough to embark on a 200-mile trek for survival.

Photographs,
 documents and drawings which detail the party's monumental struggle for
 survival have emerged 100 years after the doomed expedition - and they 
are due to be sold at auction.

Dr Murray Levick was on Captain 
Scott’s doomed Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole and was part of a
 scientific research team that found itself marooned on pack ice.

The men were forced to cocoon 
themselves in an improvised igloo and live off a revolting diet of 
penguin meat and seal blubber to survive.

After seeing out the harsh winter they mustered the strength to trek 200 miles over five weeks to reach safety.

It
 is thought the crew member's incredible story of survival was largely 
overlooked by history because the heroic death of Captain Scott was so sensational.

The accounts, photographs and diagrams
 from Dr Levick that are being sold by a private owner have brought the 
remarkable tale back from the cold.

Having
 spent the summer months observing a colony of Adelie penguins, Levick 
and the others soon realised the Terra Nova ship would not be back to 
pick them up as arranged.

The vessel was unable to reach the party due to heavy pack ice.

With
 little food or equipment and wearing clothes unsuited for an Antarctic 
winter, the men abandoned their tents and dug an ice cave - or igloo as 
Dr Levick described it.

He 
drew a diagram of the cave including positions of where the men slept 
and he described how biscuit boxes were used in the construction.

He wrote how ice was good at conducting heat so the cave was surrounded by snow, which wasn’t.

Stranded
 on the aptly named Inexpressible Island from February to September 1912
 the men were forced to live off seal blubber and penguin meat.

The
 details of the diet were recorded by Dr Levick, 36, including the 
effects of eating blubber that caused retching and sickness.

He
 wrote: 'We had great difficulty in eating the blubber, and as our 
biscuit ration was reduced to 1 biscuit per day each, we had to eat very
 large quantities of lean meat to satisfy our hunger.

'This led to a craving for starchy food that would never be satisfied.'

Listing
 the menu for the men between February 24 and March 17, Dr Levick wrote:
 'Morning: 1 pint hoosh (sealmeat and blubber) 1 spoonful of cocoa in a 
pint of hot water. Evening: ditto.'

He added: 'When all was ready the cook shouted 'mugs ready'.

'Immediately each man passed up his aluminium sledging mug...remaining in their bags to eat it.'

Another problem was the lack of salt, and using sea water instead merely gave the men diarrhoea.

Ill fated: Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott

A further predicament - one that 
nearly killed them - was when a blizzard sealed the cave and the stove, 
powered by seal blubber, almost asphyxiated them all.

The
 men, known as the Northern Party, were led by Victor Campbell, but it 
was Dr Levick’s medical knowledge that ensured they lived.

To pass the hours lying in their sleeping bags, Dr Levick wrote his detailed account and described how he read to the men.

He wrote: 'I started reading to the party in the evenings. Our library consisted of David Copperfield, Simon the Jester, the Life of R.L.S. and Boccaccio’s Decameron.

'I started on David Copperfield and read a chapter every night.'

Tobacco was another consolation and there can rarely have been a more heartfelt tribute to pipe smoking than Dr Levick’s.

He wrote: 'Now pipes and tobacco have for hundreds of years soothed and cheered the heart of Man, but I do not believe that the blessings of the precious plant have ever been felt and appreciated more than they are now being felt and appreciated by us.'

After seven months the men attempted to make it to safety on September 30 and arrived at Port Evans 200 miles away on November 7.

They then learned of the fate of Capt Scott, who had died on his return from the South Pole.

A search party that had been sent to look for the Northern Party had found their empty tents and were amazed when they learned the men had survived.

As well as the commander, Victor Campbell, and Dr Levick, the other men were Raymond Priestly, a geologist, and petty officers George Abbott and Frank Browning, and Seaman Harry Dickason.

Dr Levick’s accounts of the experience and the photographs are being sold by auctioneers Bonhams and are expected to fetch about 30,000 pounds.

Dr Levick later wrote a groundbreaking study of Adelie Penguins, the first serious monograph on the species.

A spokesman from Bonhams said: 'The story of Dr Levick and his companions is a truly remarkable tale of survival against horrific odds, resourcefulness and real heroism but it is not well known.

'If Captain Scott’s tragic fate were not so powerfully etched into the British soul the exploits of this other intrepid group of heroic Britons would be celebrated much more widely.

'These smoke stained, weather beaten notebooks of Dr Levick show why.'

The auction takes place in London on March 30.
