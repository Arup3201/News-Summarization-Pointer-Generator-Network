Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness stunned a German court on Monday by admitting he had evaded taxes of €18.5million (£15.4million) using a secret Swiss bank account - more than five times the amount on a prosecutors' charge sheet.

Once one of Germany's most admired managers, Hoeness apologised and appealed for leniency at the start of a trial in a case that shocked the country and prompted other tax dodgers to turn themselves in.

State prosecutor Achim von Engel read the charge sheet in which he was accused of evading €3.5m (£2.9m) in taxes - on undeclared income of €33.5m between 2003 and 2009.

Hoeness, who turned Bayern Munich into
 a success on and off the pitch before his fall from grace, could be 
sentenced to between five and 10 years in jail if convicted of evading 
more than €1m in taxes.

'I'm
 glad that this is all out in the open now,' 62-year-old Hoeness, who 
was wearing a dark suit and smiling nervously, told the court. 'I deeply
 regret my wrongdoing. I'm doing everything I can to put this unhappy 
chapter behind me.'

Hoeness,
 who as a player won the World Cup with West Germany in 1974 and as 
manager led Bayern Munich to two Champions Leagues and many 
domestic league titles, is hoping the voluntary disclosure will help him
 avoid jail.

He paid €10m to the tax office in January 2013, and says he voluntarily
 alerted tax authorities then about his Swiss bank account and 
undeclared income. What is unclear is whether he informed the tax office
 about his offence early enough or comprehensively enough to avoid jail.

Worried? Hoeness has a chat with his lawyer Markus Gotzens before the start of the trial

German legal experts say it appears unlikely he fulfilled those requirements.

About
 100 journalists and spectators packed into the courtroom to witness the
 start of the four-day trial. Outside the courtroom Bayern Munich fans 
held up posters expressing their support for Hoeness and pleading for 
leniency.

Hoeness told the 
court he used his secret account for more than 50,000 speculative trades
 in financial markets such as foreign exchange and derivatives from 2001
 to 2010. He said he lost €1m between 2003 and 2009.

'It
 was always clear to me that the account was mainly for gambling,' he 
said. 'It was a real kick, pure adrenaline. I lost track of it all. 
Everything was a real mess in the end.'

Hoeness
 said he was disappointed that the state prosecutors raided his house 
and arrested him before charging him with tax evasion after his 
voluntary disclosure in 2013. He said he had received death threats when
 the public learned of his case.

'The
 consequences of all this for me and my family have been a disaster,'
said Hoeness, and he had donated more than five million to charity
 in past years and paid more than €50m euros in taxes in Germany, 
he said.

'I'm not a social parasite,' he said in response to the criticism that by evading taxes he cheated other taxpayers.

The
 case against Hoeness, and other celebrities caught or confessing to tax
 evasion, led thousands to preemptively pay back taxes in the hope of 
avoiding prosecution, and helped change the public's perception of tax 
evasion as a misdemeanour to it being seen as a serious crime.

Alice
 Schwarzer, a leading feminist, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party 
treasurer Helmut Linssen, Berlin's culture minister Andre Schmitz and 
former top journalist Theo Sommer have been in the public spotlight for 
tax evasion issues.

The 
German taxpayers association said that more than 55,000 tax evaders have
 turned themselves in over the last four years, many in the last year, 
and paid a total of about €3.5billion in back taxes.

Thomas
 Muller said Bayern would dismiss all thoughts of Hoeness ahead of 
their Champions League last-16 second leg against Arsenal on Tuesday.

The
 Bavarians go into the game in Munich with a 2-0 advantage from the 
first match as they look to become the first team to retain the trophy.

'We
 will try to focus on the game. When the whistle goes for the start then
 everything else is shut out,' midfielder Mueller told reporters on 
Monday.

'I do not expect it to have any negative effect.'
