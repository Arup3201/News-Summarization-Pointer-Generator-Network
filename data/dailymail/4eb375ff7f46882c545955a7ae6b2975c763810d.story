The home where a mother and her five children were killed by a fire is thought to have been burgled on the night of the tragedy, police said today.

Sabah Usmani, 44, and sons Sohaib, 11, and Rayyan, six, and daughter Hira, 13, died in Harlow, Essex, on October 15, with a third son, Muneeb, nine, and daughter Maheen, three, dying in hospital.

Essex Police believe a burglary at the property on the night resulted in a laptop belonging to Abdul Shakoor, 45 - the children’s father and only member of the family to survive the fire - being stolen.

Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson 
from the force said he was seeking to speak to a teenage boy and young 
girl who were seen throwing a laptop bag away near the family home.

Officers originally suspected the fire
was arson but later claimed no accelerant was found at the scene. 
Police confirmed scientists had found no evidence of a flammable 
liquid being used.

Some 400 people filled the Harlow 
Islamic Centre for a Muslim funeral on October 24, joining Dr Shakoor - 
who suffered minor injuries as he fought to rescue his family from the blaze.

Paramedics, firefighters and police 
officers who dealt with the blaze attended, while teachers and pupils 
who studied alongside the children also joined members of the Islamic 
community.

On October 17 it was reported that 
tests carried out at the scene of the fire suggested that the blaze may 
have started accidentally. Police said at the time that they were not 
ruling out any possibility.

Early results suggested that the blaze
started in the lounge at the rear of the house, and the police had 
asked residents and bystanders to come forward urgently to help 
establish what happened.

DS Vinson, the senior investigating 
officer on the case, said: ‘Recent developments have moved the 
investigation forward in a number of directions and we now believe that 
there was a burglary at Dr Shakoor's house in Barn Mead in which items 
were removed from the house.

'We believe that this burglary took place after the family had gone to bed and before the fire was discovered'

‘We believe that this burglary took place after the family had gone to bed and before the fire was discovered.

‘Our inquiries have revealed that in 
Harlow during the same evening and early morning there were two other 
unsuccessful attempts to break in to other properties and one where 
entry was gained but the suspect was disturbed and nothing was taken.

‘How these incidents relate to the current investigation is ongoing.’

The officer said he was keen to speak 
to a teenage boy of around 15 or 16 wearing a tracksuit, and a slim girl
in a school uniform who were seen throwing Dr Shakoor's laptop bag away
near garages in Whitewaits, Harlow.

The bag was found near the garages on October 26 containing personal papers and a laptop lead.

Tragic: Essex Police initially suspected an arson attack but it is now thought that the fire was a tragic accident

‘We urgently need to speak to these two young people about where they found the bag,’ DS Vinson said.

He appealed to the public for help in 
finding Dr Shakoor's black laptop, which was bought in Saudi Arabia and 
had a two pin lead that was used with an adaptor.

'The
fire that raged through the downstairs of the house has left the 
contents totally destroyed. We now believe that this laptop may have 
been stolen'

He said: ‘Dr Shakoor remembers leaving his Toshiba Satellite laptop in the lounge when he went to bed that evening.

‘The fire that raged through the 
downstairs of the house has left the contents totally destroyed. We now 
believe that this laptop may have been stolen.’

Police also want to speak to a group of teenage boys who were outside the house in Barn Mead in the early hours of October 15.

DS Vinson said a group of four boys 
wearing tracksuits and baseball caps and two teenagers on pedal bikes 
had been seen in the area.

Tragedy: Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on brickwork, and the walls are black with smoke

In the immediate aftermath of the fire, police said they were treating it as a suspected arson attack.

On the same night, a neighbour's car was torched and that incident is still being investigated as arson. But no accelerant was found at Dr Shakoor's house, suggesting the possibility of a tragic accident.

'The fire burned through the downstairs of the house at a very high temperature, destroying most of the contents'

Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge, head of Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate

Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge, head of Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said today that the investigation had so far been unable to identify the cause of the house blaze.

He said: ‘The fire burned through the downstairs of the house at a very high temperature, destroying most of the contents.

‘Scientists have been sifting through the remains and have confirmed that to date there is no evidence of a flammable liquid being used.

'It is however, important to emphasise that detailed forensic testing remains ongoing.’

Dr Shakoor (right) read a statement in which he appealed ‘from my heart’ for anyone with information to help him understand the tragedy.

Unable to fight back tears, he said: ‘In the space of just one night I have lost everything dearest to me.

‘Any father, any mother, anyone who has family who they love, will understand the pain that I and all my family are suffering.

‘Allah has given me courage to face this tragedy with patience, and so many people from across the community have supported me with their love and words and comfort at this terrible time.

‘Today I am looking to the community once again for help in providing answers to the many questions that remain.

‘I do not understand why my little children who were so happy and full of life, who had so much to live for, are no longer here.

‘I ask from my heart that anyone with information comes forward to help, so that I may understand the tragedy that has befallen my beautiful family.

‘Even a small piece of information may make a difference and, however difficult it may be, I ask anyone who knows what happened, to do the right thing, to come forward and to talk to the police.’
