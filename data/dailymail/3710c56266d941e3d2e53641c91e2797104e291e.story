The Affordable Care Act will push the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers out of the U.S. labor force by the year 2021, according to a stunning report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday.

The office's latest estimates threaten to puncture the Obama administration's argument that Obamacare won't be a long-term job killer, since incentives built into the health care law appear to be discouraging taxpayers from working.

'CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024,' the CBO reported.

This, the office's analysts determined, will be 'almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor – given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive.'

In 2001 the CBO estimated that the economy would lose the equivalent of 800,000 full-time jobs as the Affordable Care Act was implemented. The new numbers for 2021 represent a near-tripling of that estimate.

'The reduction in CBO's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,' the CBO report said.

Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn lashed out at the White House after the CBO report was made public late on Tuesday morning.

'So in addition to people getting canceled policies or sticker shock and finding out that their health care costs didn’t go down, they went up, or finding that if you like your doctor, you can’t keep them,' Cornyn said on the Senate floor, 'what we’re finding is that these same people may find themselves out of work as a result of the policies of the Affordable Care Act.'

'The Congressional Budget Office looked primarily at how employers would respond to a new penalty for failing to offer insurance to employees that work more than 30 hours,' he said. 'That response would include cutting people’s hours, hiring fewer workers and lowering wages for new jobs.'

Blow: The report said jittery employers would choose to hire fewer people ¿ a focus that a White House official told reporters was 'incomplete,' 'overwrought' and 'misinterpreted. It is another woe for Obama after the botched roll out of the internet sign up, above

Early reporting on the congressional bean-counters' pronouncement focused on job losses expected because jittery employers would choose to hire fewer people – a focus that a White House official told reporters was 'incomplete,' 'overwrought' and 'misinterpreted.'

He said during a hastily assembled conference call Tuesday afternoon that the CBO report found that 'overall there's very little impact on labor demand' from Obamacare.

A White House statement issued a half-hour earlier had insisted that 'CBO's findings are not driven by an assumption that ACA will lead employers to eliminate jobs or reduce hours, in fact, the report itself says that there is 'no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA.'

The official on the conference call emphasized that workers are exercising 'voluntary choices' brought on by 'a new set of options,' including the chance to retire earlier than they may have planned.

He compared the shift of full-time to part-time labor to a hypothetical situation in which the federal government stopped paying social security benefits.

'I don't think there's any debate that if you got rid of Social Security and Medicare, more 95-year-olds would work,' the senior official said.

Pressed to explain how increased unemployment could be seen as a net benefit of Obamacare, the official emphasized the availability of 'new choices and new options that will –' adding after an awkward pause, 'lead to different choices.'

Critic: Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn lashed out at the added hardship forced on normal people who are already 'getting canceled policies or sticker shock and finding out that their health care costs didn¿t go down'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also spun the news as a positive for workers who may 'no longer be trapped in a job just to provide coverage for their families, and would have the opportunity to pursue their dreams.'

'Over the longer run,' he said, 'CBO finds that because of this law, individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families.'

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative pressure group, was unimpressed.

'The Affordable Care Act is hurting Americans by leading to cancelled plans, lost coverage, and rising costs,' the group's president, Tim Phillips, said Tuesday in a statement, 'but it's also proving to be detrimental to economic growth, just as many of us predicted.'

'The CBO's numbers speak for themselves,' he said. 'The reality is, big government programs like Obamacare do not and cannot create lasting prosperity or opportunity for anyone.'
