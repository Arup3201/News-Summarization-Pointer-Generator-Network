With two swim-in wave pools, arcade games littering public spaces and free gourmet food on offer, it isn't hard to see why a job at Google is so sought after.

The internet giant allegedly receives a resume every 25 seconds from eager job-seekers, and is expected to be deluged with 40,000-plus candidates wanting an internship.

And it is little wonder, considering the perks on offer to successful applicants.

Among the many perks at Google are two swim-in-place wave pools

Assorted video games, all free, are available anytime for employees needing a break in Mountain View, California

As these candid snaps - released ironically just days after Google's involvement in the NSA's PRISM program  was exposed - show working for one of the world's biggest corporations isn't all hard work and no play.

Secluded nap pods inside the sprawling Mountain View, CA, headquarters give employees somewhere to rest their head in between meetings, while arcade games and pool tables litter open spaces.

Free gourmet food - served three times a day - has seen employees coin the term ‘the Google 15’, with fifteen being the average number of pounds the food-lovers put on after over indulging.

And if that wasn't enough, electric scooters help workers get between sections of the multi-building campus-like offices - dubbed Googleplex - south of San Francisco.

Massages and a state-of-the-art gym help workers remain relaxed and healthy, while the dress code is decidedly casual - jeans, t-shirts and jumpers being the norm.

It is little wonder Google ranked number six in Forbes' 25 best places to work list.

Fortune Magazine Senior writer Adam Lashinsky told CNN Money: ‘It's almost impossible to find a perk that Google doesn't offer its employees.

‘It's the kind of place where, yes, you're going to work but you also know you're going to have a fun time as well.’

Other perks: free haircuts, dry cleaning and laundry, child care, car services and five on-site doctors available for employee check-ups - all free of charge.

And employees can even bring their dogs to work, keeping the four-legged canine in their offices.

‘I joke with my bosses that I would go there and work every day even if they didn't pay me,’ long-time employee and VP of Search and New Products Division Marissa Mayer told CNN Money.

‘Everyone works hard, everyone plays hard and everyone is happy this way,’ said Corin Anderson, a Google software engineer, to CNN Money.  

‘It's a lot like a college atmosphere,’ commented John Dickman, a Google Global Food Manager to CNN Money.

‘'It's very relaxed. It's about having fun. Googlers are curious, creative, smart inventive people,’ said Laszlo Upbock, Google People Operations, to CNN Money.  

Adam Lashinsky, Fortune Magazine Senior Writer, added: '’What a stimulating environment Google is. Not only are they working on cutting edge products, but they really think about how to occupy their employees' brains.  

‘If you want to work, I just couldn't imagine a more exciting place to do it right now.’

Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in September 1998.

Since then, the $54 billion company has grown to more than 30,000 employees worldwide.
