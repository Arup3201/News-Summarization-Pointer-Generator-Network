At-home DIY tattoo kits, otherwise known as 'stick and poke' tattoos, are predicted to be one of 2015's most popular cosmetic trends, despite official warnings from the FDA about the risks involved in at-home inking. 

According to fashion website Style.com, stick and poke body art, which is created by repeatedly puncturing the skin with a needle that has been soaked in tattoo ink, is set to be one of the New Year's biggest crazes, thanks in large part to a range of budget-friendly kits currently being sold through a variety of retailers for just $40. 

'Tattoos are back and the coolest style to have is a stick and poke,' the website's shopping editor Steff Yotka wrote.

'...We trust that the stick and poke is going to stick in 2015.'

But the website's decision to encourage readers to try out the controversial trend has been met with outrage by some of its readers, who claim that DIY tattoos are 'ridiculous' and 'dangerous'. 

'In no way should you be encouraging anyone to tattoo themselves that is inexperienced, outside of a sterile shop, and not done by a professional,' user Kayti Hurd commented on Style.com's Facebook page. 

'Tattoos are lifelong markings, not some trend that you can ditch the next year when something new comes along. Shame.'

Amy Jessica Lipson added: 'Style??!! Jailhouse tattoos are the antithesis of good style. (Or common sense for that matter.)'

A spokesperson for the FDA told MailOnline that anyone wanting to try a stick and poke tattoo for themselves should first be aware of the risks involved in at-home inking. 

Steady hand: The art of stick and poke tattooing involves puncturing the skin repeatedly with a needle that has been soaked in special ink

'The most commonly reported problem involves microbiological contaminants, which may be introduced into bottles of ink during manufacturing or packaging, or when the inks are being prepared for injection,' FDA press officer Lauren Sucher said. 

'Injecting contaminated ink into the skin, using contaminated needles or poor site preparation may result in infections at the site of the tattoo that can spread throughout the body via the blood, a condition known as sepsis. 

'These infections can be severe and require extensive treatment with antibiotics, hospitalization, or surgery. Symptoms of illness after receiving a tattoo include redness, swelling, itching or blemishes in the tattoo, or pain in the tattoo that does not go away. 

'Once the infection has healed, the area may remain permanently scarred.

'Other potential health threats may include increased sensitivity to sunlight or exposure to toxic constituents present in some inks.'

Let it go: Critics have hit out at the trend, claiming that it is 'ridiculous' and 'dangerous'

Ms Sucher added that the FDA have already recalled a large number of stick and poke kits, after they were found to contain toxic inks or unclean needles. 

'At-home tattooing can be more dangerous if the individual does not know how to select good quality inks and equipment including sterile needles,' she added.

'If purchasing kits online for home use, consumers should not use and should dispose of tattoo inks and tattoo kits that have been recalled. 

'The consumer should know how to properly prepare the skin for tattooing and apply the ink. Proper pre- and post-tattooing hygiene and after care are important in preventing complications.' 

Stick & Poke, a popular DIY tattoo kit brand, also warns customers against the potential dangers of at-home body art, urging people to ensure they are protected against toxic inks, unclean supplies and dirty needles, some of the most common causes of infection.

On its website, the company also offers a list of 'six things not to do when tattooing', which includes helpful tips such as: '[Don't] be drunk or under the influence of a state altering drug.'
