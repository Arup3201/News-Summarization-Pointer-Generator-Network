From Jimmy Buffett posing barefoot outside his Palm Beach, Florida, tropical getaway to ballerina Misty Copeland stretching out her legs in the living room of her Manhattan home, the portraits show just how much our personalities is reflected in where we live.

Each of the ads, which will appear in newspapers, magazines and online, bear the tagline: 'Live Who You Are,' the company's campaign which was launched in 2006.

'Annie walked into the homes of our subjects and immediately knew how to bring their personality and passions to life - she has a magical ability to uncover what makes people tick. 

'Her work with the 12 subjects in this campaign has made the notion of "live who you are" more tangible and authentic than ever.'

As part of the campaign, the company has also launched a photography contest whereby competitors can send in selfies taken in their home for the chance to win a stay at New York's NoMad hotel.
