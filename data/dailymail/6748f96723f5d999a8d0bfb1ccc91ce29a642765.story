The American ‘Frankenstein Food’ giant Monsanto is giving up on a multi-million pound drive to force GM crops on to dinner tables in Britain and Europe.

The company said the decision has been driven by the fact that the vast majority of farmers and consumers have no interest in growing or eating the crops.

The move comes despite the fact the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has made it his business to back GM farming and food.

He has launched a series of initiatives designed to overturn public scepticism and to try and speed up the approval of new GM crops by the European Commission.

Mr Paterson has suggested that the UK could go it alone and begin growing GM crops even if other EU member states maintain their own bans.

However, Monsanto spokesman, Brandon Mitchner, said: ‘We are no longer working on lobbying for more cultivation in Europe.

‘Currently we do not plan to apply for the approval of new genetically modified crops. The reason is, among other things, low demand of the farmers.’

This was confirmed by a spokesman for Monsanto Germany, Ursula Luttmer-Ouazane, who told the media there that the company recognises there is no demand.

She said: ‘We've understood that such plants don't have any broad acceptance in European societies. It is counterproductive to fight against windmills.’

Other GM companies, such as Bayer CropScience, BASF and Syngenta, have also dramatically scaled back or dropped efforts to get their crops accepted in Europe.

Successive British governments have bowed to pressure from US politicians and lobbied for the acceptance of GM crops in the EU, however other member states have remained opposed.

Eight governments have banned cultivation of a Monsanto GM maize called MON 810, which is genetically modified to kill pests which feed on it, on the basis it might cause harm to other important insects.

The ban on the maize and other forms of GM has been made under an EU environmental protection provision known as the ‘Safeguard Clause'.

The eight are Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and most recently Poland, while Italy said it plans to follow suit.

Even American consumers are now becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of biotech farming with pressure in many states for the labelling of food containing GM ingredients.

While Monsanto and others may have given up on growing GM food in Europe, they continue to lobby for Britain and Europe to accept imports of the biotech crops for animal feed.

A number of leading UK supermarkets recently announced they would allow GM feed to be given to chicken, pigs and cattle for the first time.

Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op have joined other major names, including Morrisons and Asda in allowing GM soya and maize to be used as animal feed.

The companies claimed they had no choice because it was becoming increasingly difficult to find non-GM soya from Brazil, the USA and other sources.

This has been denied by suppliers in Brazil, while supermarkets in many other countries, including a number in Europe, say they will continue to source non-genetically modified crops for their farm animals.

The UK stores will not label the meat, eggs and milk coming from these animals to identify their GM diet despite research saying this is what most shoppers want.

Critics of the decision suggest the stores have effectively allowed GM firms to decide UK food policy rather than customers.
