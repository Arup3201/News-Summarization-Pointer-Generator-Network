When strange bits of clothing started turning up on their doorstep Richard and Sophie Windsor were puzzled to say the least.

Later, as towel sets, baby clothes and a German sausage found their way on to their kitchen floor, the confusion deepened.

When they then spotted half a pizza wedged in the cat flap the penny finally dropped – their beloved pet moggy Norris had turned into a cat burglar.

Norris has been known to steal from neighbours' homes and gardens in Bedminster, Bristol - much to the dismay of his owners

Eyes on the prize: Norris began by stealing food from neighbours' bins before moving onto clothing and homeware

The two-year-old tabby started bringing 
home food about a year ago, before raiding local gardens, washing lines 
and even venture into nearby houses in Bristol.

He returns home to his embarassed owners, Richard and Sophie Windsor, every morning with a stockpile of pants, bras, dusters and food. 

The cat has amassed such a huge pile of knickers from these moonlit raids his owners have red-facedly delivered letters to residents admitting they may have of some of their property.

Every morning Norris shows off his loot to his embarassed owners Sophie and Richard Windsor who have had to deliver letters to neighbours explaining his naughty habit

Richard, 26, a graphic designer, said: 'He was perfectly well behaved up until the age of one, then he started to turn to a life of petty crime.

'He first started bringing things in from the recycling bins when he was about one. At first it was just the odd thing - but over the last four months, he has really started to up his game.

'Initially it was dusters and dish cloths but this has now intensified to clothes, including bras, pants, T-shirts and jumpers.

'We have even had a pair of washing-up gloves - each brought in on a separate night. He goes out in the evening and then returns quite late on or in the early hours.

'He brings his stolen items in and then meows and meows to announce he is back so we will go and see what he has brought in. Sometimes he will go out multiple times during one night.'

Norris roams the streets of Bedminster every night looking for something to bring home. His owners believe the problem has developed because there is no wildlife in the area for the cat to chase after

The couple are now trying to reunite the items with their owners after collecting a huge stash of Norris' stolen goodies in a special cat swag bag.

They delivered letters explaining his naughty habit, appealing to anyone who was missing items from their washing line to get in touch.

Mr Windsor added: 'At first we thought it was funny. But as his stash grew and the items were getting bigger, we thought we needed to return them.

Norris sneaks through neighbours' catflaps and into their homes where he has his pick of clothes, food and homeware

'It is not as if they are high-value items, but they all belong to someone..

'Fortunately all our neighbours have been very good natured about it and think it is funny. At least now they know where to come if something disappears mysteriously.'

The couple have started ignoring Norris when he arrives home from a night of looting in the hope he'll soon drop the bad habit.

'By ignoring him when he arrives and tries to wake us up, we hope he will stop doing it.

'There are lots of other cats in the area which I guess means there is not much wildlife around to hunt. So Norris chooses to steal stuff instead to pass the time.'
