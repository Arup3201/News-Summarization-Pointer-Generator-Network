It looks like Jon Corzine’s love of risk-taking is finally proving to bring him down after his securities fund today filed for bankruptcy protection.

Futures brokerage MF Global Holdings filed after a tentative deal with a buyer fell apart, marking a stunning failure for its 64-year-old CEO.

His career has taken him to the top echelons of Wall Street as Goldman Sachs CEO, into politics as a U.S. senator and to New Jersey governor.

But the MF Global meltdown makes it the biggest U.S. casualty of Europe’s debt crisis, as it pays the price for his risky bets on sovereign debt.

The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing came after talks to sell a variety of assets to Interactive Brokers Group reportedly broke down earlier on Monday.

It also comes one week after MF Global, whose shares plunged 66 per cent last week, reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss.

Besides the loss of $186.6million for the fiscal second quarter, investors were spooked when MF Global's debt was downgraded to junk status.

The seventh-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history by assets is reminiscent of when Lehman Brothers fell at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.

MF Global traders and counter-parties were left scrambling and confused on Monday, as the fund halted its shares.

But it did not file for bankruptcy until well after the U.S. markets opened.

‘Ultimately it will have lost all confidence of its investor base,’ said Michael Epstein, a restructuring adviser with CRG Partners.

Three traders wearing MF Global jackets were seen leaving the Chicago Board of Trade prior to the opening of pit trading.

Floor sources said they had been turned away after their security access cards were denied.

Jeff Carter, an independent futures trader in Chicago, said the impact on the markets should be smaller and nothing like when Lehman failed.

Mr Corzine's decision to chase yield by going after European sovereign debt was clearly ill-advised and always seemed much too risky, he said.

MF Global scrambled through the weekend and into Monday to find buyers for all or parts of the company.

But at the same time it was hiring restructuring and bankruptcy advisers in case nothing could be done.

Mr Corzine was trying to transform it from a brokerage that mainly places customers' trades on exchanges into betting with its own capital.

He took over MF Global early last year. It has turned a profit just three times in the past 12 quarters.

Mr Corzine is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, helping raise at least $500,000 for the President’s re-election campaign since April.

MF Global, which filed in New York, has assets of $41.05billion and liabilities of $39.68billion, according to its bankruptcy petition.

'The real question is how many assets will be left to transfer,' said Niamh Alexander, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Bank stocks dropped broadly on Monday 
after the bankruptcy filing. Bank of America fell 4.5 per cent and 
Citigroup plunged 5.5 per cent.
