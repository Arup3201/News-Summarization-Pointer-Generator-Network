Caught: Christopher Maffei, 43, surrendered while allegedly attempting to flee with his two children he kidnapped from their mother

Two children were rescued Friday from a sailboat that was stolen by their father accused of abducting them from their mother's home in Central California, authorities said.

The Coast Guard, FBI and South San Francisco police had been tracking the 40-foot sailboat Unleashed, which was sailed from a harbor in Alameda on Tuesday.

Police said earlier that day, Christopher Maffei, 43, had removed his 3-year-old daughter Brooklynn and 2-year-old son Devin from their mother's home while she was out.

The children's rescue came hours after the guard spent most of Friday following the boat as it slowly sailed down the rugged central California coastline. Chief Petty Officer Mike Lutz said a guard airplane followed the boat south to Monterey Bay, where the rescue occurred.

'A Coast Guard cutter approached the vessel and just started talking to them,' Coast Guard spokesman Thomas McKenzie said. 'He put his hands up and surrendered without incident.'

Maffei's daughter Brooklynn and son Devin were being examined by medical personnel and would be reunited with their mother, McKenzie said.

Escape: Maffei was found on this stolen sailboat, a white Hunter 41, he had shown interest in buying last week

Maffei is the former boyfriend of the children's mother, Jennifer Hipon. She told reporters that she was at a courthouse filing custody documents on Tuesday when Maffei went to her house and took the children from her elderly mother.

South San Francisco police say that after running off with the children, Maffei drove to the harbor in Alameda and left on the 40-foot sailboat. He sailed the boat out the Golden Gate, and headed down the coast, police said.

San Francisco police said Maffei had visited the owner of the stolen yacht with his two children two weeks ago to ask about buying it and to inspect the vessel.

A fisherman spotted the sailboat off the San Mateo County coast on Friday, and law enforcement started a slow-speed chase as they tried to intercept the vessel, police said.

McKenzie said the stolen boat was recovered and would be returned to its owner.

Destination? The children's mother believed Maffei may have been trying to sail towards Mexico where he talked about taking his two children on holiday

Hideout: According to the children's mother, Maffei may have also been planning to take them to Thailand, where he previously used to work

The children's distraught mother Jenifer Nipon believed Maffei was trying to possibly head to Thailand where he has lived previously or to Mexico where he previously talked about taking Brooklynn and Devin on holiday.

She told the San Mateo County Times: 'I 
want the Coast Guard. The Navy. Anybody who has a boat. Please look for 
my children and bring them back to me. I am afraid for my children's 
lives.

'He got a sailboat and he's somewhere out there in the ocean. I am not sure where he is right now.'

She told BC7 News: 'I'm afraid if they back him into a corner. I just don't want him to snap and do something really stupid more than what he's already done, so I'm just really worried for my kids and I just want them to come back home to me safe and unharmed.'
