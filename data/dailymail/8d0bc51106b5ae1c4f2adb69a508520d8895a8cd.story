A Seattle teacher surrendered his teaching license after, police say, he gave marijuana to a student.

After 18 years as a 'star' teacher in Seattle Public Schools, Dan Richman, 63, quietly resigned from his position in July when allegations surfaced that he had unprofessional conduct with a student.

Richman, who reportedly shared a video on social media praising gang involvement, allegedly bought marijuana for an 18-year-old during an after-hours meeting.

Authorities say that Richman called the 18-year-old woman and arranged to meet with her, according to a report by seattlepi.com. 

Then he took her and another student to a medical marijuana clinic where he purchased the marijuana and gave it to the students. 

At the time, investigators say, Richman was a language arts teacher with Interagency Academy, a network of small, 'alternative' high schools around Seattle for the city's most vulnerable teens. 

Richman was put on leave when the allegations surfaced in May, and was reportedly teaching through the Academy at the King County Youth Services Center

Richman was a well-liked teacher in the schools, he even befriended many of his students on Facebook. 

After being placed on leave in May, investigators told Richman of their findings regarding his alleged misconduct and, just two weeks later, Richman resigned.

A spokesman for Seattle Public Schools said Richman resigned for, what he described as, 'personal reasons.' 

However, when Richman voluntarily gave up his teaching license in November, he ended the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction's investigation into the claims against him, according to Seattlepi. 

The OSPI only has authority over licensed teachers, Richman giving up his license closed the OSPI's investigation. 

Though the action ended the investigation, in doing so, Richman became ineligible to teach at public and private schools in Seattle.
