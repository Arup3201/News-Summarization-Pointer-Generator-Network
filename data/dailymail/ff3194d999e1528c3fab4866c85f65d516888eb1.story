In the near future, airlines could share tracking data and get free access to a range of cutting-edge technologies to prevent any more planes being lost without a trace.

These are two of the suggestions made by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) at an event in Montreal this week, set up in the wake of the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia flight MH370 in March.

It follows separate plans from London-based Inmarsat to offer free flight tracking to thousands of commercial passenger planes.

Experts gathered in Montreal this week to discuss a worldwide framework for tracking flights. Proposals include airlines being able to share data, and preventing tracking tools from being disabled. It was organised in the wake of the MH370 disaster in March when a Malaysia Airlines plane, stock image pictured, went missing

Speaking at the event, the ICAO said global flight tracking is now so vital, it has set a deadline for the processes to be in place by September.

On
 board a plane there are cockpit voice and flight data recorders – the 
‘black boxes’ – which each include a ‘pinger’ that sends a transmission 
up to 30 days after submersion underwater.

In
 the black box is an ASD-B flight transponder which, unlike the GPS in a
 car, broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic
 controllers every second.

Crews are also able to speak to their airline through discrete radio channels.

The
 cockpit voice recorders can additionally reveal conversations and other
 sounds to hint at problems that may have occurred during the flight.

Officials from 40 countries gathered for the ICAO summit to discuss a range of tracking options.

The organisation will now take this framework of worldwide standards and decide which solutions to put into place.

During the summit, members were presented with a number of flight tracking technologies and protocols for tracking planes.

One includes preventing anyone from being able to disable the flight tracking systems on all planes, while another suggested a global database so tracking data can be shared more easily.

It is likely the organisation will choose a variety of tools and technologies to widen the scope of searches, rather than getting all airlines to subscribe to the same one.

Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the ICAO said: 'This systems-based approach acknowledges that what will best service airlines and manufacturers over the longer term will be the flexibility to choose from amongst the latest and most cost-effective innovations that meet their global flight tracking needs.'

Inmarsat's technology, pictured, helped reveal the last position of missing flight MH370 in March, and now the London-based firm is offering free tracking to 11,000 commercial passenger planes. In addition to free tracking, the company is also offering a 'black box in the cloud' that will store historic and real-time flight data

'As ICAO considers the requirements 
for global flight tracking, we will also be looking closely at the most 
effective means of sharing tracking data when needed with applicable 
search and rescue and accident investigation authorities.'

Satellite firm Inmarsat announced its plans to track flights for free last week, as a direct response to the missing plane.

In
 addition, the firm will also provide a ‘position reporting’ tool in 
case flights veer off track, and a so-called ‘black box in the cloud’ to
 track real-time data remotely.

This remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course, or communication is lost. and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts.

Inmarsat’s service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings.

This service is being offered to 
planes which are already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection,
 which the firm claims is ‘virtually 100 per cent of the world’s long 
haul commercial fleet’.

Analysis
 of data from Inmarsat and the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch in 
March showed the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed in the southern Indian
 Ocean.

Rupert Pearce, chief executive of 
Inmarsat, said: 'Inmarsat
 has been providing global aviation safety services for over 20 years 
and we are confident that the proposals we have presented to ICAO and 
IATA (International Air Transport Association) represent a major 
contribution to enhancing aviation safety services on a global basis.

The service is being offered to 11,000 planes already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, stock image of a Boeing 777 cockpit is pictured. The firm claims the service will cover 'virtually 100 per cent of the world's long haul commercial fleet'

‘In the wake of the loss of MH370, we believe this is simply the right thing to do.

‘Because of the universal nature of existing Inmarsat aviation services, our proposals can be implemented right away on all ocean-going commercial aircraft using equipment that is already installed.'

Flight MH370 vanished on 8 March with 239 people on board, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Evidence revealed on 15 March by the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak suggested the jet was deliberately diverted by someone on board.

Five days later, Australian search teams announced they were investigating two objects spotted on satellite images in the southern Indian Ocean.

On 24 March, Razak said analysis of satellite data - by Inmarsat - confirmed the plane went down in the Indian Ocean. More debris was spotted on 28 March.

The latest update, at the start of last month, claimed to have detected ultrasonic signals from the plane's black box.

Two months on, the plane has still not been found.
