Alastair Cook’s leadership of England’s one-day team was looking increasingly hard to justify after his latest batting failure paved the way for yet another series defeat.

The sixth game against Sri Lanka had been billed as a resurgent England’s chance to set up the pleasant surprise of a decider in Colombo on Tuesday.

Instead, Cook fell to the third ball of their run chase, leg-before for a single to the off-spin of Sachithra Senanayake, then watched as his team-mates slumped to 202 all out and a crushing 90-run loss.

England now trail Sri Lanka 4-2, and have lost five of their last six bilateral series. Cook’s average out here is 17.

Earlier, the England captain put down the simplest of catches at mid-off to reprieve Kumar Sangakkara on 41.

Sangakkara is not a man given to spurning second chances: already in red-hot form, he went on to a match-winning, run-a-ball 112, his 20th one-day century.

This was not a good day for the credibility of English cricket. And it strained further when Cook spoke of his determination to stay in the job. ‘It’s tough,’ he said. ‘I’m not scoring the runs I’d like. It’s not a great place to be as a captain.

Joe Root was again one of the only men to stand up and be counted, scoring another fifty 

‘I’m a better player than I’m showing at the moment, and I’ve just got to keep going. I’m hitting the ball quite nicely in the nets.’

Asked whether he would still lead England at the World Cup, he answered simply: ‘Yes.’

But there was a more equivocal response from coach Peter Moores. Asked on Sky Sports to confirm Cook would indeed lead his side out against Australia at Melbourne on February 14, Moores said: ‘As with everything we will sit down and review it at the end of the series.’ It was not a ringing endorsement.

Cook has now scored 87 runs in five innings in this series at a strike-rate — 67 — that belongs to an era when one-day openers still regarded their job as taking the shine off the new ball.

Now, one-dayers are viewed by almost every team as elongated games of Twenty20.There have been 44 sixes in this series by 16 different batsmen; Cook is not among them. The counter-argument is that he is not supposed to be a rope-clearer, but an accumulator who allows the strokemakers to bat around him. The counter-argument has fallen flat, too.

England’s reply had its moments. Moeen Ali carved 34 off 32 balls and Root made an enterprising 55. Woakes’s 45-ball 41 underlined his all-round credentials.

But James Taylor suffered his first failure since returning to England colours, Ravi Bopara wasted another opportunity after pleading for a promotion to No 5, and Eoin Morgan fell first ball.

England had been profligate with the ball too. After steady opening bursts from Steven Finn and Chris Woakes, Sri Lanka pulled away during a second-wicket stand of 153 in 30 overs between Sangakkara and Dilshan.

James Tredwell was as tidy as ever, but Chris Jordan reverted to the scruffiness that marred his performances at the start of the series, and eight wides took England’s series tally to 65.

Cook lamented: ‘This is a good reality-check. We have to stay tight as a team.’ There are many who feel he should already have played his final game in a one-day shirt.
