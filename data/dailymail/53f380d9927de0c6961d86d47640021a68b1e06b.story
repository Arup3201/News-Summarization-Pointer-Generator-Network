Rebel: Lady Warsi claims Tories have neglected the votes of ethnic minorities in favour of white voters

David Cameron has left it too late to win next year’s general election because he has failed to woo the ethnic minorities, Baroness Warsi warned yesterday.

In a further salvo after resigning from the Government over Gaza, she claimed that the Prime Minister’s ‘public school’ allies did not understand modern Britain.

She also claimed that some of Mr Cameron’s inner circle had dismissed her – the first Muslim female Cabinet minister – as being not up to the job because she was a ‘brown, working-class woman’.

Last night a Conservative MP criticised Lady Warsi, saying if the Tories were not winning the ethnic minority vote that was her fault as much as anyone’s because she had been minister for community cohesion.

Alec Shelbrooke, the MP for Elmet and Rothwell in Yorkshire, claimed that she had ‘embarrassed herself’.

He added: ‘I think within a week, “Who was Lady Warsi?” will be the question. She has ended her career in many ways.’

Lady Warsi quit as a Foreign Office minister last week, saying the Government’s position on the Gaza crisis – and its failure to properly criticise Israel – was ‘morally indefensible’.

Mr Cameron had given her a job in his first Cabinet as party chairman in an attempt to give the Tories a more modern face.

Lady Warsi was later moved to the Foreign Office – widely seen as a demotion – and given a job as faith minister charged with improving community cohesion.

In a newspaper interview yesterday, she said Tory bosses were ignoring ‘electoral reality’ by relying on white voters.

The peer, who comes from a working-class background in Yorkshire, said: ‘The electoral reality is that we will not win outright Conservative majorities until we start attracting more of the ethnic vote.

'We’ve probably left it a little too late to take this part of the electorate seriously.’

Rounding on criticism of her, she said: ‘Some of the bitchiest women I’ve ever met in my life are the men in politics.

‘I am a brown, working-class woman from the North. People have been telling me I’m not good enough since the day I was born.’

In a reference to Mr Cameron’s inner circle, she added: ‘I don’t hold the fact that someone went to public school against them.

‘I don’t hold the fact that they haven’t had the breadth of experience that some of us who didn’t go to public school have had.

‘I hope that if I can be so understanding about their background and shortcomings, they can be understanding to those of us who haven’t had those opportunities.’

Lady Warsi called on the Government to recognise Palestine as a state and impose an arms embargo on Israel.

She criticised George Osborne and Michael Gove for failing to use their ‘very, very close’ relations with the Israeli government to defuse the crisis.

Dismissing the Chancellor’s claim that her resignation had been ‘unnecessary’, she said: ‘My actions would not have been necessary if he had done what he should have done, which is pick up the phone to people he is incredibly close to and say, “It’s unnecessary for you to meet your ends by taking out power stations, taking out homes, taking out schools and killing kids on beaches”.'

Boris Johnson has given his clearest indication yet that he hopes to lead the Tory Party, saying he has shown in London he had the ‘ruthless energy’ to get things done.

He said he ran for the job of London mayor six years ago to ‘show what I can do’. Asked if he wanted to follow David Cameron as leader, he replied: ‘I would certainly say I know an awful lot about administration and public service now.’

Mr Johnson last week announced he would seek to return to Parliament. He is said to be in talks to contest the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in west London. A poll yesterday put him in the lead to succeed Mr Cameron – with 34 per cent of all voters and half of Tory supporters wanting him to take over.

In a Sunday Times interview yesterday, he also took a swipe at arch-rival George Osborne, denouncing the Chancellor’s ‘lack of vision’ in dismissing his idea of an airport in the Thames Estuary.

One MP said Mr Johnson’s allies wanted a repeat of the 2010 election when the Tories were the largest party but did not win a majority. The Johnson faction could then join Labour to vote down a Tory-Lib Dem coalition and he would ‘storm through’ a subsequent leadership race.
