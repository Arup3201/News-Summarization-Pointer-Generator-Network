The woman arrested over the nursery investigation has been named locally as Nina Russell, the pre-school room leader

A woman has been arrested by police investigating a children's nursery.

The Little Angels Nursery in Calne, Wiltshire, has been closed by Ofsted and staff from the nursery are currently informing all parents. 

A spokesperson for the nursery confirmed that all he knew was that it was not the owner of the nursery, Rachel Everitt, who had been arrested.

He said police still had not told Ms Everitt who had been arrested or what they had been arrested in connection with.

A letter outside the pre-school said inspectors had stepped in because of their belief 'that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm'. 

The notice on the door said the nursery - graded 'good' during an inspection in May - had been suspended from offering childcare pending an investigation.

Worried parents were told to contact social services if they have any concerns.

The letter said: 'The purpose of suspension is to allow time to investigate our belief that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm and for any necessary steps to be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.

'We will regularly review the situation and will stop the suspension within this period if we believe children are no longer at risk.

'Suspension does not automatically mean that a provider in unsuitable to provide care in the future or that we will cancel registration.'

The spokesperson added that the nursery will reopen following the investigation.

The woman has been named locally as Nina Russell, the pre-school room leader. She declined to comment on the on-going investigation. 

When asked if she was the 37-year-old woman arrested in connection with the investigation she, speaking with her husband Jonathan Russell, said: 'I cannot talk about it any further at this time.'

An Ofsted spokesperson said: 'We have suspended this nursery's registration' 

Police said a 37-year-old woman was arrested on Saturday and taken to Melksham police station. She has since been released on police bail and investigations are continuing.

Wiltshire Police would not confirm if the woman was a member of staff, or why she had been arrested.

A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that police are conducting an investigation into allegations relating to Little Angels Nursery in Calne.

Fears: A letter outside the pre-school said inspectors had stepped in because of their belief 'that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm'.

'The nursery has been closed by Ofsted and staff from the nursery are in the process of informing all parents of the closure.

'We can confirm that one woman, aged 37, was arrested on Saturday 16 August, and was taken to Melksham police station. She has since been released on police bail. Enquires continue.

'We are in the early stages of an investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter.'

An Ofsted spokesperson said: 'We have suspended this nursery's registration.'

The nursery was given a rating of 'good' during its last inspection by the education watchdog on May 27.

According to the report, there are 78 children on the roll at the nursery, with nine staff directly involved with them.

The 34-place facility has four rooms available to the children, with a playground and occasional use of a school gymnasium.

According to a profile on the nursery website, Mrs Russell is the pre-school room leader and also the deputy officer in charge.

It adds: 'I work 4 days a week from 8am to 6pm. I am NVQ 3 qualified and am also the nursery Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator. (This means I can help if your child experiences any developmental difficulties whilst at Little Angels).

'I have been in childcare for 20 years now and worked at Little Angels Nursery for 4 years now, I enjoy working with all ages of children and recently taken the position in the pre-school room and really looking forward to the next year!'
