From the Abominable Snowman to the Loch Ness Monster, there's no shortage of mythical creatures rumoured to walk the Earth - and no shortage of people convinced they truly do exist.

But few legendary beast aficionados are as committed as those dedicated to Bigfoot, with legions of hunters from Texas to Oregon dedicated to tracking down Sasquatch.

Among them are Rick Dyer, a hunter from Georgia, and Las Vegas entrepreneur Tom Biscadi - both of whom say they are the man to uncover the truth about the mythical monster.

Found it? Rick Dyer has claimed to have tracked Bigfoot down not once but twice

Now a new BBC documentary, Shooting Bigfoot, has delved into their often bizarre world where conspiracy theorists and unscheduled falls in the river are all part of the job.

But while the men are convinced, not everyone agrees, among them the mother of Rick's daughter Audrey.

And the fact she's not convinced is partly down to Rick himself, who in 2008 claimed to have found Bigfoot but was soon revealed to have found nothing more than a Sasquatch costume that he had filled with possum roadkill.

'I hurt a lot of people in 2008 with the 
hoax,' he admits, 'a lot of true believers, and I'd like to redeem myself and show 
that I'm the real deal.'

In a bid to prove it, he's travelled to Texas where reports from San Antonio say that a homeless person encountered the beast while sleeping rough in the woods.

'Some homeless people called it in and 
three motorists called it in, and then I came up here and across this 
path, I saw it,' says Rick.

'I'm not going to tell you how tall it is because I don't
 know but it was a hairy upright creature and when I saw it, my heart 
dropped.

'I am 100 per cent in no doubt that there is a Bigfoot and 
that there is a Bigfoot right here.'

But while Rick is dedicated to the pursuit of Sasquatch, his six years in the game make him a novice compared to Biscardi, who has spent 37 years hunting Bigfoot.

'I've seen the creature with my own eyes,' he reveals.
 'I was 12ft away from one once and I freaked out.

'I made a dedication to 
myself that day that I'm going to bring one of these things back because
 I know they exist. 37 years later, I'm still doing it.'

Quite what Mrs Biscardi makes of it all is anyone's guess, although his son TJ has been known to team up with his father and his crack 'A-team' of Bigfoot hunters.

Travelling with TJ and Tom is Young Blood, described by Biscardi as his 'chief tracker and sharpshooter' and Chico, an elderly survival specialist.

When Biscardi isn't out hunting for Bigfoot, he's busy making documentaries; among them Bigfoot Lives, Bigfoot Lives 2 and Bigfoot Lives 3.

It might sound bizarre but Biscardi is convinced he knows what he's doing. 'You hear about people saying they're a 
Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot researcher, Bigfoot this and that, crypto 
zoologist,' he complains.

'Crypto my ass - the name of the game is this: you either heel
 and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or 
you'll never find anything.'

While Rick might call himself a Bigfoot hunter, he says that he too is the real deal. 'God has sent me something to say "Look, 
there is a Bigfoot, be committed now."

Rather menacingly, he continues: 'Unfortunately for the Bigfoot, 
I'm going to have to kill it. If there is someone out here in a costume,
 they will be dead soon because I'm going to kill them.'

So does Bigfoot really exist? Biscardi is convinced that the primate prints he finds come from a juvenile Sasquatch while Rick goes public with claims that yet again, he has managed to shoot and kill Bigfoot - and has the corpse to prove it.

'Growing up I thought I'd be a cowboy,' adds Rick, 'but I gave it up for the same reason that you don't 
pursue a lot of your little pipe dreams.

'This is not a pipe dream - a 
pipe dream is something you can't achieve.'
