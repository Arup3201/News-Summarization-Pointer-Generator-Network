It was meant to reveal the ocean’s deepest secrets, but a one-of-a-kind submersible vehicle now lies in a watery grave.

The Nereus’ journey deep into the Kermadec Trench to the north east of New Zealand ended when the robotic vehicle crumpled under the pressure of the water, just over 6 miles (10km) below the waves.

Scientists believe that part of the vehicle imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it - as great as 16,000lbs per square inch.

Crushed dreams: The Nereus' journey deep into the Kermadec Trench to the north east of New Zealand ended when the robotic vehicle (pictured) crumpled under the pressure of the water, just over 6 miles (10km) below the waves

Its mission was to undertake high-risk, high-reward research in the deepest parts of the ocean, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, which built and operated the multi million pound research vehicle.

The institute's chief scientist Timothy Shank, said: 'Nereus helped us explore places we've never seen before and ask questions we never thought to ask.’

‘It was a one-of-a-kind vehicle that even during its brief life, brought us amazing insights into the unexplored deep ocean, addressing some of the most fundamental scientific problems of our time about life on Earth.’

Researchers aboard an expedition ship called the Thomas G. Thompson explained that they lost contact with their robot seven hours into a nine hour mission on Saturday May 10.

That sinking feeling: Scientists believe that part of the vehicle imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it - as great as 16,000lbs per square inch. It was lost in the  Kermadec Trench (pictured) - one of the earth's deepest oceanic trenches - to the north east of New Zealand (pictured)

Before the catastrophe, the robot had taken samples from the sea floor and samples of sea life.

Ken Kostel, of the institute, said: 'We'd just completed collecting a sea cucumber for the respirometer and were getting Nereus ready to head to the underwater elevator.

‘Then the camera feeds abruptly went dark, and we lost communication with the vehicle.’

The submersible, which was designed to operate autonomously as well as be controlled remotely by humans, was connected to the surface by a fibre-optic cable.  It also had a system whereby it would gently float to the surface if the cable failed.

However, the back-up could not be used and a member of the ship’s crew saw white objects in the water.

‘The rescue boat went in and three crew members began scouring the surface with nets as more and more white dots appeared. By then we knew. Nereus was gone,’ Mr Kostel said.

The submersible was lost 30 days into a 40-day mission aboard the research ship, which was carrying out the first systematic study of a deep-ocean trench as part of the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Hadal Ecosystems Study (HADES) project.

The Kermadec Trench (illustrated) runs northeast from the North island of New Zealand to the Louisville Seamount Chain. It is the second deepest oceanic trench in the world and formed by subduction - a geological process in which the tectonic plate is pushed beneath the Indo-Australian Plate

Nereus had completed a number of deep and dangerous missions, including travelling to the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, which is thought to be the deepest point in the ocean at over six miles (11km) below the waves.

Since its launch in 2008, it had also shed light on the world’s deepest known thermal vents at Cayman Rise in the Caribbean.

Larry Madin, the institute’s director of research, said: 'Extreme exploration of this kind is never without risk.

'The unfortunate loss of Nereus only underscores the difficulty of working at such immense depths and pressures.’

Nereus brought back specimens of animals previously unknown to science on its first HADES trip. It also collected seafloor sediment to help experts reveal the physical, chemical and biological processes that shape the deep-ocean ecosystems in ocean trenches, which are unlike almost any others on the planet.
