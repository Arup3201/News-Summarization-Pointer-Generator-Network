Grotesque, but informative: New medical photo-sharing app Figure1 lets health professionals share images of medical conditions for informational purposes

There are amputated feet, surgically removed tumors and lacerated arms about to be diced by surgeons.

It's not hit U.K. reality TV series Embarrassing Bodies, but a new mobile phone sharing app created for medical professionals. 

Like an Instagram for doctors, the Figure1 application lets practitioners quickly upload unusual, informative and shockingly grotesque images to share with colleagues.

But
co-founder Dr. Josh Landy, a Toronto-based critical-care specialist, 
said the network was not designed for voyeurs but to provide 
time-stretched health workers with an additional information resource. 

'An image with a story goes a long way,' Landy told the National Post.

'There is
no question in my mind, educating doctors saves lives.

'Having someone who has
easier, more efficient access to information, who learns something more about a
patient they are currently seeing, is going to improve the care of that
patient.

Scroll down for images, but be warned - they're gruesome

Hundreds of pictures have already been uploaded since its launch
just two weeks ago, mostly from U.S. posters.

From mundane diseases like rashes and spots to the amputated, gangrenous foot of a diabetes patient, the images are not for the fainthearted.

And the app is not just for medical professionals - anyone can download it.

Like Instagram for doctors: Figure1 co-founder Dr Josh Landy said the new app will help improve patient care

When you open Figure1, you are shown recently added photos but you can search for particular ailments.

You can also 'favorite' images you are particularly drawn to.  

For the creators, the most important feature is the ability of community-members to comment or share their knowledge of particular diseases.

According to Gizmodo, the app 'does try its best' to maintain patient privacy and confidentiality, with consent forms for patients to sign before pictures go live.

Consensual: Patients are de-identified before images of their weird diseases are shared on Figure1

Information sharing: Medical professionals who use Figure1 can upload pictures of puzzling diseases which other doctors can comment on

Some of the more startling pictures include a finger with a piece of metal attached by a screw, a penile implant removed due to leaking saline solution and a large cataract.

Dr. Kendall Ho, a University of British Columbia emergency-medicine
professor who specializes in using technology to educate, said Figure1 is a good tool for sharing medical 'pearls', according to Gizmodo.

Dr.
David Maslove, a critical-care specialist asked to beta-test Figure1, said the app could 'expand the horizons' of some medical professionals.

'This is kind of a way to leverage the wisdom of the crowd,
extend the sphere of your own clinical experience,' he told Gizmodo.

Huffington Post Business reports the founders plan to one day make money from the app and take it global.
