Killed: Ezell Ford, 25, was shot three times by LAPD officers, including once in the back, on August 11

The autopsy of a mentally ill black man who was killed by Los Angeles police has revealed that he was shot three times at close range, including once in the back.

Ezell Ford, 25, was shot dead during a confrontation with LAPD officers near his home in South Los Angeles in August this year.

Ford's parents accuse the LAPD of 'executing' their son and have filed a $75million lawsuit against the city.

Ezell Ford was shot three times in his right side, right arm and back, and had abrasions to his left hand, forearm and elbow, according to the autopsy report.

The autopsy also revealed that a muzzle imprint, consistent with that of the gun used by LAPD, was found around the back wound.

The report was disclosed Monday after police initially ordered the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office to withhold the results for months to avoid tainting potential witness statements.

Ford was unarmed when police confronted him on a street near his home in South Los Angeles in August 11.

Representatives from the LAPD said officers tried to speak to him but got into a struggle with Ford and shot him when he tried to grab an officer's gun.

Ford's parents say the killing of their son was 'more like an execution than a confrontation,' according to their attorney.

Representing the family, Steve Lerman said the autopsy report was 'horrifying' and supported the parents' claim that the shooting was 'unjustified, illegal and unconstitutional.'

He said the family read the report together and that Ford's parents have 'gone into seclusion.'

'They're distraught, they're hysterical with grief and anger,' Lerman said.  'It essentially filled in their worst nightmare that this happened like this'.

Killed: Ford's parents say the shooting of their son was 'more like an execution than a confrontation,' and have filed a $75million lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles

Ford's parents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit and a $75million claim against the city alleging the two gang officers knew Ford from the neighborhood and were aware he had mental problems. 

Lerman said an expert is reconstructing the incident along with witness statements from people who directly saw what happened, and he was confident the family would prevail in court.

'It's simple to me that they pounced upon an unarmed defenseless man they knew to be mentally challenged and ended up shooting him in the back and killing him, that's the nutshell,' Lerman said.

Lerman has said his investigator found witnesses to support his case, but he refused to divulge details.  

The suit also claimed that the city, LAPD and 10 unnamed superiors or other officers were part of a culture that tolerated civil rights violations, including racial profiling and excessive force against blacks. 

The autopsy reports comes at a time when tensions between the black community and police are at their highest in recent memory.

Mass protests have been held across the U.S. Following the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the chokehold death of 43-year-old Eric Garner in New York City.

Both deaths involved white police officers and unarmed black men, but neither case saw any charges brought against the officers responsible. 

The anger at police took a horrific turn on December 20th, when two New York officers were executed in their squad car by a man who said he was targeting cops as revenge for the deaths of Brown and  Garner. 

Last week, Antonio Brown, a black 18-year-old, was shot dead  by a white officer at a gas station in Berkeley, Missouri.

Police say Antonio Brown pulled a loaded 9mm handgun on the officer and that the police officer was justified to open fire.

Discovery: The autopsy report revealed that a muzzle imprint, consistent with that of the gun used by LAPD, was found around the back wound on Ezell Ford's body, indicating that he was shot at extremely close range

A small protest was held on Monday night in Crenshaw District, a few miles from Ezell Ford's home, following the release of the autopsy report.

Around 30 to 40 protesters were involced in the peaceful march, while shouting 'No justice, no peace.'

A short while afterwards, a group of about 30 protesters blocked traffic on the southbound 110 Freeway in South Los Angeles, but were escorted off the road by California Highway Patrol, abc7.com reports.

Police Chief Charlie Beck told a news conference on Monday that the investigation into Ezell Ford's death was far from over.

'There is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers,' Beck said.

Beck said the officers reported that Ford attracted their attention with suspicious actions then knocked one officer to the ground.

Ford was atop the officer and grappling for the officer's holstered weapon when his partner fired two shots and the fallen officer pulled a backup gun and shot Ford in the back, according to an account read by Beck on Monday.

Beck said officers told investigators it was a violent struggle in which 'the (downed) officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity - possibly, probably the cause of the muzzle imprint mentioned in the coroner's report.'

He said the muzzle imprint was consistent with the type of weapon used by the officer, and that the other weapon was a semi-automatic pistol that probably wouldn't leave the same kind of mark.

Beck said he had no indications thus far that the officers involved knew anything about Ford's mental condition, and that police have tried to reach witnesses listed by the family's legal staff but were unable to successfully speak to any.  

The imprint indicated Ford was shot either right up against his skin or very close to his skin, said Richard Lichten, a retired law enforcement lieutenant and a police practices expert. He said the abrasions only indicated Ford had sustained friction wounds at some point.

Additional details such as injuries to the officer involved in the scuffle would provide more details, Lichten said.

'The autopsy report is only one piece of the puzzle, only one piece, and no one should render a solid opinion based only on an autopsy report,' Lichten said.

He said many other types of evidence from interviews, officer statements, measurements, photographs, gunshot residue and details about the bullet will also be analyzed during the investigation.

The LAPD previously identified the two gang officers involved as Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas.

The chief said it would be several months before the investigation was completed and presented to the civilian Police Commission to determine if it was within department policy. Meanwhile, the officers remain on non-field duties.

The commission will receive separate recommendations from Beck and the department's independent inspector general. The county district attorney's office will separately determine if the shooting was justified or if charges should be filed.

Beck said the department has found no witnesses who saw the confrontation between Ford and the officers. He appealed for any possible witnesses to come forward. 

The LAPD said no officer was hurt in the incident, and Ford, who was identified by family members, died in hospital.
