When Fleur East took to the stage in the first live X Factor show on Saturday, it wasn't just her performance that impressed.

She also drew admiration for her defined abs, with judge Mel B complimenting the singer for her toned muscles during her appraisal. 

So what's the secret to Fleur's enviable figure?

Abs factor: Fleur revealed her toned tummy as she performed on on the first live show  

The 26-year-old from East London told Women's Health that there are no quick fixes - it's all down to exercising regularly and eating well.

She said: 'I normally hit the gym five times a week. I tend to do half an hour of cardio – on the treadmill or a spin class – then head for the weights. I do a lot of core work, obviously!'

Core work refers to exercises to strengthen the core muscles around the abdomen. These act like a corset, pulling the stomach in and improving posture.

Exercises Fleur said she does to strengthen her core include the plank - which she boosts she can hold for two minutes.

Appreciation: The judges were impressed with Fleur's performance as well as her figure

Beginners should start by trying to hold the position for 30 seconds. It involves lying face down on the floor, positioning your arms under your shoulders, and then lifting your body up so you're balanced on your toes and forearms. The stomach should be held it and beginners may be feel wobbly - it's certainly a move that's harder than it looks.

Variations include doing the plank side on, balancing on one forearm and the outside of the foot. 

Personal trainer and author of the Fat Burn Revolution Julia Buckley told MailOnline that Fleur is wise to do the plank for a toned tummy.

She said: 'The plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body, including the deep abdominal muscles. It is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises.'

Now Fleur is strong enough to hold the position for two minutes, Julia recommends she takes it further by adding some movement.

She explains: 'I'm a big fan of adding movement to planks once you're able to hold the position with good form, adding motion does much more to strengthen and shape the abdominal area than simply staying in the pose for ever longer periods of time, so I get clients to raise alternate arms and legs or doing things like palm-to-elbow planks where then alternate between having their hands and elbows on the mat.'

Other moves Fleur does to get her toned stomach include mountain climbers and press-ups. 

Speaking of the latter, she told the magazine: 'Yes, they're an upper body move but your core's engaged all the way through.' 

Julia agrees. She said: 'Press ups are an awesome all-body move, again you're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position, which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you're sculpting the chest and arms.'

Mountain climbers involves bending down on the floor with the hands down and arms straight and then moving your legs in a running motion bringing alternative knees up to the chest and straightening the leg again.

'Mountain climbers are fantastic exercise, offering a total body workout in single “do anywhere” move. The core is activated to keep the body in position while you power the legs out behind you. They are hardcore, but if you want to burn body fat these will definitely get you ignited!' Julia said. 

Fleur isn't afraid to lift weights or use exercise machines at the gym. Her figure proves doing so achieves a slim, muscular figure - not one of a bulky body builder which some women fear they will get if they lift weights.

The X Factor finalist, who is mentored by Simon Cowell, said she uses the leg press machine and does squats with a barbell. 

Julia said this is a great move: 'Squats are among the best exercises you can do to firm up and sculpt the legs and bum and they also work the core and back muscles. Using a loaded barbell for these is an excellent idea once you've cracked the right technique because they fire up some large muscles which makes them great for fat burning - and no one wants their ripped abs hiding under a layer of flab.'

For Fleur, exercise is a pleasure and not a chore.

She said: 'I've always loved working out. When I was little my dad used to make me and my sister do 10 press-ups every day, before we brushed our teeth in the morning. It was like a boot camp! Then I did a lot of athletics at school, and was a dancer.'

She added that she eats healthily rather than following a strict diet. She'll opt for brown bread and rice other white varieties because they have a lower Glycemic Index and avoids fizzy drinks and sweets. For a snack to keep her energy up when rehearsing, she favours fresh fruit and mixed nuts.

She admitted sticking to her rule of 'everything in moderation' can be difficult now she's currently outside her usual routine.

'There's a lot of temptation in the X Factor house,' she said. 'All the girls have a sweet tooth – they love sweets and chocolate. So I'm trying to convert people!'

But she revealed the finalists are all being encouraged to take care of themselves thanks to an in-house chef who cooks healthy meals and a gym within their plush shared mansion.

After an understated start to the competition - where she fared to stand out hugely from the crowd in the audition and boot camp stages - Fleur impressed Cowell at the judges' houses stage seeing her through to the live shows. After her performance on Saturday, she's now tipped to go far, so we'll be seeing a lot more of those abs.
