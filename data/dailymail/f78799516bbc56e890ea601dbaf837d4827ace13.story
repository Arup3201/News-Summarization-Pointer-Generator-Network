Los Angeles Kings star defenseman Slava Voynov pleaded not guilty on Monday to a felony charge of domestic violence against his wife.

The 24-year-old two-time Stanley Cup winner, who is currently suspended from playing in the NHL and on $50,000 bail, entered the plea at his arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court.

The Russian international is accused of attacking his new wife, Marta Varlamova, 24, in their home in October and was arrested in a LA hospital after taking her there to be treated for injuries.

His wife of four months has already issued a statement denying she is a victim and claims her injuries occurred by accident.

Denial: Slava Voynov at Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday after his arraignment for a domestic assault on his wife, Marta Varlamova

During his appearance, a judge denied the District Attornye's request for a criminal protective order against Voynov after her lawyer told the court the couple were still living together.

Voynov, who faces up to nine-years in prison if found guilty, faces a single count of corporal injury to spouse with great bodily injury stemming from an October 19 altercation at their home in the LA suburb of Redondo Beach.

Prosecutors said Marta, who has a child with Voynov, sustained injuries to her eyebrow, cheek and neck.

When he was charged in October, Voynov's lawyer, Craig Renetzky, said in a statement: 'Mr. Voynov is extremely disappointed that the district attorney's office elected to file charges.

'Mr. Voynov maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name in court. We remain confident.'

An attorney for Mr Voynov's wife has also released a statement, denying his client is a victim and that she believes the injuries were an accident.

'Not a criminal': Voynov's wife has spoken through her lawyer to say her husband is not guilty and did not hurt her on purpose.

The statement from October reads: 'Marta was stunned by the news today and she is devastated. She did not believe, and does not believe, that her husband intended to injure her and she believes that he is not guilty of any crime.

'She is worried about her family's privacy and concerned that she and her family are going to be subjected to ridicule, embarrassment and hatred because of this decision.

'In fact, she has already seen that beginning to happen.

'It is unfortunate that no one seemed to care what she wants, and that the authorities gave little or no weight to her view of the facts of the case.

'Despite this unwelcome news, she still expects her husband to be cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.'

The NHL suspended Voynov indefinitely for the duration of his proceedings and he has not played since October 19. However, he continues to be paid.

NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said: 'We are aware of actions taken today in California, which we will review and evaluate before making any decisions.

'Until further notice, the current terms of Mr. Voynov's suspension remain in place.'

Voynov only married Marta Varlamova in August 2014, two months before the alleged assault.

On announcing Voynov suspension, the NHL cited a section of the collective bargaining agreement saying they have power to suspend a player during a criminal investigation if failing to do so 'would create a substantial risk of material harm to the legitimate interests and/or reputation of the league'.

The NHL's swift response comes in stark contrast to the NFL, which was criticized for failing to appropriately deal with players facing charges, including Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson.

Rice was only suspended for two games from the Baltimore Ravens after he was arrested for hitting his then-fiance in an elevator at a casino in Atlantic City.

But after a website shared a video showing him striking her, the NFL banned him indefinitely and the Ravens released him, amid much public uproar.

Peterson, a running back for the Minnesota Vikings and a former MVP, was also suspended indefinitely with play by his team after he was charged with child abuse in Texas.

He is accused of allegedly whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch in May.

Voynov's swift suspension also comes a year after the NHL failed to comment or enact a suspension when Colorado Avalanche goaltender Semyon Varlamov was arrested on assault charges. Charges in the case were later dropped.

In June 2013, Voynov and the Kings agreed on a six year, $25 million contract extension. The Russian has two assists in six games this season.
