Usually burglars like to work quickly and in darkness to prevent them from being caught red-handed.

However, a pair of cheeky crooks took a far more relaxed  approach when breaking into a residency in China.

They plonked themselves on the sofa and flicked on the homeowner's TV, helping themselves to delicious snacks while they were at it.

Unfortunately for these foolish home invaders, they were immediately arrested after being spotted on a remote surveillance camera.

The man of the house, 32-year-old Chung Chang, was at work when he randomly decided to check his security gear on account of a 'sixth-sense'.

He watched absolutely stunned as two men casually wandered around his living room in the city of Linyi in eastern China's Shandong province, enjoying all the facilities on offer.

The nerve of them! A pair of burglars sat on the sofa to snack and watch TV while invading a residency in China

'When I saw these two men in my flat I was very confused,' Chung says.

'At first I thought they might be friends of my son, but when I called him he said he wasn't at home.

'My wife was away on a business trip so I knew they weren't her friends.

'Then I saw them putting on white gloves and looking through my things and I realised they were burglars.

'And they had the cheek to watch my TV and eat my crisps too!'

Chung then called the police who went straight to the block of flats and knocked on the door.

'Sixth sense' - Fortunately the flat owner decided to check his security cam from work and spotted the intruders wandering around his living room 

A police spokesman said: 'When officers arrived the men inside were clearly very surprised.

'We heard lots of swearing coming from the other side of the door and then it went quiet.

'The two men were found hiding under the owner's bed after police and club wielding security guards went inside.

'At first they said the flat was theirs, but when we asked them why they had been under the bed they realised the game was up and confessed.'

The convicts, who had previously shared a jail cell and had only just been released, now face up to five years.

Busted! The police were immediately called and the men were found hiding in the bedroom before they were taken away in handcuffs
