Owen Coyle was dismissed by Bolton Wanderers before lasting a mere five months at Wigan. It’s a record which fails to inspire Celtic supporters.

Yet Shaun Maloney baulks at the notion that the latest bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Neil Lennon is somehow damaged goods.

‘I wouldn’t describe him as that,’ said the Scotland attacker, an intermittent presence in the Wigan team when Coyle was in charge.

‘I think damaged goods is a harsh phrase to use. I couldn’t tell you the ins and outs - but I think he was close to getting the Celtic job when he was at Burnley and that’s probably the reason why he’s being mentioned again.’ 

There may be more to it than that.

In Ireland – the homeland of Celtic’s major shareholder Dermot Desmond - significant sums are changing hands. Sources close to Coyle dismiss the markets and say talk of a meeting with Desmond is misplaced. More than one candidate who was led to believe he would be granted a meeting with the billionaire has been left gazing at their phone in recent days.

Following two spells at Parkhead and one under the former Ireland striker at the DW Stadium, Maloney should be well placed to offer a compatibility assessment of Coyle and Celtic, but admits to being a lousy judge in the past.

‘I worked with a really good man and someone I thought would be a really good Celtic manager - and that was Tony Mowbray,’ grimaced Maloney.

‘So I’m not sure if I could say who would be good for it or not.

‘That didn’t work out pretty quickly. I didn’t play too many times for him but when I did play I liked him as a person and his style of football.’

The Wigan star can say the same of Coyle. He liked the Glaswegian greatly, praising the bond he forged with his players.

At St Johnstone, then Burnley, Coyle built a reputation as the coming man of British football. But when Celtic came calling in 2009, he opted to remain in England – a decision many Parkhead supporters believe should invalidate his renewed interest this time around.

To say the Celtic fanbase shows a lack of enthusiasm for Coyle’s candidature would be understating things. Many are positively vitriolic on the subject.

Yet Maloney says that’s unfair on a man who was once one of the hottest managerial properties in the British game.

‘It’s a difficult one with him losing his job at our place and at Bolton,’ said the 31-year-old.

‘I can see why there are questions. But it’s harsh to try to judge someone before they even get the job. But that’s just football.

‘It’s the same with players. It’s a results business and that’s fine. You know when you go into management that if you win games you will be fine.

‘He had a brilliant reputation and got the Bolton job and he hasn’t done so well at our club.

‘So he’s on the other side of things at the moment, but that might not last forever. He could get his next job and do very well.’ 

Maloney may be right. Yet even as he tried his best to provide backing and support for his former boss he also contrived to provide more reasons for caution amongst supporters.

‘I’ve been involved in situations with a change of manager at club level a few times. I wasn’t actually there the last few weeks before Owen lost his job at Wigan because I was in America for treatment.

‘Uwe Rosler came in and there has been a huge turnaround in our fortunes. We weren’t good enough to get past QPR in the play-offs, which was fair, but the change under the new manager has been pretty colossal really.’

As recommendations for Coyle go, it’s hardly ringing. Yet it states a bald truth.

Since Coyle left and the German came in, Wigan have thrived and prospered, enjoying a strong second half of the season.

Maloney is at a loss as to why Coyle couldn’t emulate Roberto Martinez or Rosler, but suggested it wasn’t for the want of trying.

‘He definitely tried to cultivate a really good relationship with the players, that was his biggest idea. That’s the way he tries to manage the club.

‘His assistant Sandy Stewart did the bulk of the coaching – that’s the way the two worked.

‘In fairness, it was difficult for him when he came in because we had a very different style of manager and style of football before him than the club had been used to for four years.

‘We had just been relegated and lost some of our best players – and I think he had to sign a lot as well, so it wasn’t the easiest start he had. It was a tough job for him.’

Experienced: Coyle has also managed Bolton and Burnley in the Premier League

For many, however, there is a question to be answered. If it was difficult managing a team in a town of 50,000 with modest expectations, how might he cope at Celtic? 

‘Wigan don’t really have too many press requirements,’ added Maloney. ‘The Celtic job is at the other end of that scale.

‘You’re dealing with hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of fans worldwide and there’s a new level of expectancy of winning trophies.

‘Wigan are now faced with the expectancy of being in the top six of the Championship - and we don’t feel intensity in the town the way it is in Glasgow. That’s the polar opposite. 

‘In Glasgow, particularly with the two bigger teams, that’s just the main focus for people in Glasgow.

‘There are not many jobs down south, apart from the top six or seven, would stand you in good stead for Celtic.’

Back in the Scotland squad to face Nigeria for the first time since he scored the winner against Macedonia in October, Maloney is more focused on his own situation now.

He managed just five games for Coyle in a Wigan shirt before going under the surgeon’s knife then managed the same again at the end of the season. In contrast with others in the squad, then, he feels fresh and ready for Tuesday’s clash with the World Cup finalists at Fulham’s Craven Cottage.

‘I’ve not really got too much fatigue going on the at the minute, so I’m just happy to be here, but this is certainly a tougher team to get into than when I was involved last time.’
