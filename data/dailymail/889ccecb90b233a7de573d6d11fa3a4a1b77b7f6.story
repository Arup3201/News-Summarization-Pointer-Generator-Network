A woman who has confessed to seducing a teenage boy has been forced to register as a sex offender and is facing up to 14 years in prison.

Marie Friendship, 38, pleaded guilty to one count of having sexual activity with a child, from a total of eight charges.

Friendshipâ€™s guilty plea to the single charge was accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court.

Marie Friendship from Whitchurch, Bristol admitted one count from a total of eight charges at Bristol Crown Court

She was told to register as a sex offender, while the judge adjourned sentencing for a probation report to be prepared.

Richard Posner, prosecuting for the CPS, said the Crown would consider applying for a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO).

Such an order can be designed to prohibit contact between sex offenders and young people.

Robert Duval, defending, said: 'This is a serious offence and I accept that is the case. We would like to have a pre-sentence report. This is a lady of previous good character.'

Friendship, from Whitchurch, Bristol, was bailed, pending the probation report, for sentence on September 21.

She was bailed on condition she has no contact with the complainant.

The Recorder of Bristol Judge Neil Ford QC told her: 'The fact I am adjourning the case for a pre-sentence report is no indication of the sentence imposed on you in due course.

'The fact you have been given bail is no indication of the sentence.'

Marie Friendship, who cites Harry Potter and David Beckham as 'likes' on her Facebook page, is listed as in a relationship on the social networking site.
