Nine sailors were forced to abandon their vessel and wade to safety through shark-infested waters after they hit a reef during a round-the-world race.

Danish entry Team Vestas Wind was running in fourth place in the Volvo Ocean Race when they ran aground close to the tiny archipelago of St Brandon, 270 miles north-east of Mauritius.

The order to abandon ship came in shallow waters, but at 4am local time and in a part of the Indian Ocean notorious for being well populated by sharks.

Save our souls: The nine-man crew were able to wade through shallow waters to a nearby rock where they were finally rescued just after daybreak by a small boat from the nearby coastguard at A�le du Sud

Australian skipper Chris Nicholson led his team, wading knee deep through the waves in darkness, to a rock which provided them a dry place to shelter.

A small boat from the nearby coastguard at Ã�le du Sud then picked them up just after daybreak and took them to the tiny islet where they rested after their ordeal.

Another boat in the race, Team Alvimedica - a joint U.S.-Turkish entry - stopped racing and sped to the area where Vestas was grounded to assist if necessary.

It was later cleared to resume after Nicholson confirmed that none of his crew were injured and had been safely rescued.

Team Vestas Wind had been racing in the second leg of the race, between Cape Town and Abu Dhabi, when their £3.8million boat was caught on the reef.

They spent nine hours battling to free it before giving up and leaving the vessel.

Volvo Ocean Race CEO Knut Frostad said: 'I'm extremely relieved that every one of the nine crew members now are safe and that nobody is injured.

'That has always been our first priority since we first learned about the grounding.

'I really feel for Chris and the team right now and we will continue to support them all the way going forward.'

Five people have lost their lives taking part in the race since it started in 1973.
