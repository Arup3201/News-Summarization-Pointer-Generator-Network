Worryingly for a man who controls a rogue state and regularly threatens nuclear war with America, North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un is 'socially awkward' and struggles to make eye contact when meeting anyone new.

That is the verdict of the documentary crew who traveled with eccentric sports legend Dennis Rodman to the secretive communist nation in late February where he infamously declared himself a 'friend for life' to the 29-year-old despot as they bonded during a basketball game.

Indeed, the surreal trip was more bizarre than anyone could have first imagined - as details emerged of Rodman serenading Kim with Frank Sinatra's 'My Way' at a dinner reception to mark the game but not before they had heard a female North Korean pop band play the theme song to 'Rocky' on electric violins.

The brainchild of Brooklyn based media company VICE, the trip was ostensibly to follow the Harlem Globetrotters to the reclusive and repressive nation as they staged an exhibition basketball game.

Incredibly, the crew had no idea it would meet the reclusive country's young leader, Kim Jong Un, until he showed up at a basketball game it was filming with Rodman - which led to the unlikely bromance between the pair.

The crew from VICE discovered that Kim Jung Un loves basketball so much that he overlooked his government's antipathy for VICE founder Shane Smith, who had made two critical documentaries on North Korea, and personally invited the crew in.

Smith wasn't allowed back but VICE's Ryan Duffy accompanied Rodman and three members of the Harlem Globetrotters traveling basketball troupe.

Asked yesterday about the meeting that forms the center point of their documentary, Duffy said that Kim Jung Un was 'socially awkward' - but not as weird as Rodman who does not once speak to the camera - even though VICE organized the entire trip.

Instead, he is only seen as a distant figure, wearing dark sunglasses and a baseball cap.

Duffy quickly learned his place: One of the first things one of his 'tour guides' told him was, 'I know who you are. I don't like you and I don't like your company,' he said Wednesday. to the New York Daily News.

The crew was told when it could turn on its cameras and when they had to be off, and feared landing in a North Korean prison if it didn't comply, he said.

The crew went through an elaborate week-long organized tour of North Korea's capital of Pyongyang, visiting a well-stocked mall with no other customers and the country's version of Sea World.

At one point, it was shown a classroom with students sitting behind computers, but only one person either knew how or was allowed to use one of the machines.

One student sat before Google's home page and never searched for anything, just moving the cursor back and forth randomly.

The tour was taken in the hopes of catching one or two glimpses of the real North Korean people, which the group finally achieved toward the end when its minders let the bus stop at a park and the Globetrotters played around with some of the kids, helping them learn to spin a basketball on their finger.

Duffy said the group was surprised when Kim arrived to watch what was essentially a pickup basketball game with the Globetrotters and some members of a North Korean youth team.

Rodman didn't play; he sat in the stands watching with Kim. After the game, the VICE crew and players were rushed across Pyongyang unexpectedly for a dinner with Kim and other members of the North Korean government.

Rodman was only in the country for two days for the Vice show but he and Kim Jung Un got on so well that Rodman was able to reveal stunning snippets of the dictator's life.

He said to journalists after he returned that Kim Jung Un- the ruler that Rodman called a 'kid'- has a young baby girl and that he heard Kim's wife talk all about her at length during his trip to the exiled regime.

The 51-year-old athlete also told how the North Korean leader likes 80s disco music, is humble and normally wears normal clothes when not appearing for cameras.

The description that Rodman is touting comes in direct contrast to the widespread understanding of the dictatorial leader and the military rogue state that constantly threatens nuclear war.

'It was insane, they treat him like a god. But Kim is not one of these Saddam Hussein-type characters that wants to take over the world,' Rodman told The Sun.

'His grandad built all this s**t and then his dad built some more s**t but he is a normal guy,' Rodman told The Sun.

Rodman revealed other details about the lavish trip, including the contents of the 15-course banquet (fish, noodles, and meat), the décor of the palace (‘marble everywhere’) and the height of Kim’s wife, Comrade Ri Sol-ju (5’5” which is ‘quite tall for a Korean’).

The trip was apparently a major success, and Rodman has already accepted a second invitation to visit Kim again for six days in August.

Although Rodman was key to securing the visit and played the most prominent role of any of the visiting Americans, he's only a bit player in VICE's documentary. Smith said Rodman declined to be interviewed about the trip by VICE afterward.

The American group brought in some basketballs and basketball equipment to distribute to young North Koreans, but wasn't asked for anything else by its hosts, Smith said.

VICE hasn't spoken to anyone in the Obama administration about the trip, he said. During the trip, the administration had refrained from commenting about it.

HBO and VICE have not agreed to continue its series of news documentaries beyond this season, but the arrangement is likely.

HBO said the show gets solid ratings, while VICE said the network gives VICE valuable exposure beyond the young audience that traditionally follows its product.
