Juan Mata has a habit of delivering when you least expect it.

While at Stamford Bridge the little Spaniard with the big heart turned up at the office of a Chelsea supporter to deliver him his new club shirt, and had to persuade the receptionist to let him in.

Earlier this year, at a Primary School in the impoverished Wythenshawe area of Manchester, he stunned schoolchildren by arriving unannounced armed with dozens of toys.

Juan Mata celebrates after scoring a double against Liverpool at Anfield, when Manchester United needed him

Mata's second goal in particular was superb, and showed why United spent so much money on him

The little Spaniard put United ahead in the first half with a tidy finish following an Ander Herrera pass

But United fans have had to wait until now, 14 months after David Moyes paid Chelsea £37m for his services, for him to deliver on the pitch.

Why has it taken so long? There is mitigation. Mata's joyous arrival coincided with the miserable final throes of Moyes regime. When the ship is sinking it is hard to dance the tango in the ballroom.

Then came Louis van Gaal and a rigid pragmatism the playmaker presumably thought he had escaped when he said farewell to Jose Mourinho.

A free spirit, Mata has not been the only one at Old Trafford to take time to digest the platter the Dutchman demands. 

Van Gaal was quick to take praise following what feels like a seismic 2-1 win in Liverpool, proudly stating that he had now found a position for a man who will never be anything other than a number 10 in a number eight shirt.

Mata is beginning to repay the faith shown by Manchester United's fans, who have stuck by him

Louis van Gaal claimed a tactical masterstroke, but he was really only playing Mata in his obvious position

When he arrived at David Moyes' United, Mata was trying to bring momentum to a losing team

The playmaker was allowed to leave Chelsea because Jose Mourinho didn't rate his defensive contributions

But a look at Van Gaal's record would suggest that, given time, he gets it right.

Now the same can be said of Mata, although 14 goals in his last 32 appearances would suggest not much was wrong with the 26-year-old in the first place.

The statistics show that his talents have ever been in doubt.

Since his arrival at Chelsea in 2011, no midfielder has a better joint total of goals and assists in the Premier League.

Mata has 65 (31 goals and 34 assists), ahead of compatriot David Silva who has 61 (26 and 35) for United's cross-town rivals despite having played a season more in England.

Majestic in the 3-0 romp over Spurs, Mata was at it again at Anfield.

His first was provided by another new arrival with a point to prove. Ander Herrera, much to the annoyance of many of the Stretford End faithful, has been absent for long periods of the season. 

Mata has been excellent in recent weeks, dominating against Tottenham before scoring twice on Sunday

The Spaniard watches his wonderful volley fly into the top corner, as he announced his arrival at Anfield

The man from the Basque country has basked in the limelight of the first team and his defence-splitting pass for Mata illustrated what United have been missing.

Mata, showing a surprising turn of pace, finished clinically into the bottom corner - but the moment United fans will forever remember came when he contorted his tiny frame to rifle a Mark Hughes-esque scissor-volley from Angel Di Maria's pass past a helpless Simon Mignolet.

Forget the helicopter landing at Carrington, Mata had finally arrived.

In the away end there was delirium. Scoring any kind of goal against the old enemy can provoke that kind of response from the most sober of United fan.

In the commentary box there wee gasps. Thierry Henry, a man who knows all about the sublime, hailed the strike as ridiculous.

Many will not have seen it coming but plenty of those who did needed no reminder of his talents.

In a Wetherspoon's close to the KC Stadium, where Chelsea were playing Hull City, there were groans from visiting supporters watching on television as Mata volleyed in United's second.

Those supping cut-price ale in the Admiral of the Humber will no doubt know all about the importance of good deals but many watching events unfold from the other end of the M62 voiced their opinion that Jose Mourinho was wrong to let the playmaker go, despite the hefty fee the dainty man delivered.

Since arriving in England, Mata has more goals and assists combined than any other Premier League player

Manchester City star David Silva is behind Mata statistically, despite having been in the league a year longer

Chelsea fans were upset to lose their creative spark, and could now do with some of his quality in midfield

Some think that Mata's old club, despite running away with the Premier League, lack creativity in his absence and can only dream of a world in which he creates chances for Diego Costa.

They bemoan their Portugese manager's insistence of only selecting prototypes, those who will race back and do their part in the Mourinho masterplan to stifle the opposition.

Their loss, it would finally appear, looks set to be United's gain.
