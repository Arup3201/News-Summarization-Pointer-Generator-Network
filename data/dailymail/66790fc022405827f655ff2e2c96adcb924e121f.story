What happens when you bring together 40 professional dancers and 40 treadmills?

An epic fitness flash mob, of course.

The high-energy video was shot on location in Logan, Utah, and was conceptualised by fitness equipment manufacturer, NordicTrack.

Forty professional dancers, along with YouTube and Vine stars, came together for an epic fitness flash mob

Filmed on location in Logan, Utah, the dancers jogged in place on and off for over 12 hours during the shoot

Twelve YouTube and Vine stars were on hand to create the musical masterpiece, dancing along to the song The Str!ke by band Atom Bomb.

Choreographed by Jason Celaya, it featured local dance teams like My Bad Crew, USU Dance Companies, Dance Factory, and USU Dance Club.

Over the course of a grueling 12 hours, the 40 dancers jog-danced in high altitude - and, on occasion, on an incline - while being filmed on an Epic Red Dragon and 4k Sony f7 camera.

The high-energy melody - a song called The Strike by Atom Bomb - provided the soundtrack

As part of NordicTrack's #makefunhappen campaign, the video was released and has since gone viral

The music video showcases NordicTrack's new technology and has already been viewed 2.1 million times

The #makefunhappen campaign is in part to promote the brand's new 1-Touch Incline and Decline controls.

Select NordicTrack treadmills had adopted iFit technology and also boast reflex cushioning to help your run or walk feel more 'real' - just don't attempt to leap onto the handlebars.  

The video was filmed near the Icon Health & Fitness Headquarters.
