The ex-wife of disgraced International Monetary Fund chief today insisted she 'knew nothing' about his extra-marital affairs and orgies.

In her most revealing interview to date, 65-year-old Anne Sinclair also said she 'never believed' he regularly had sexual relations with other women at home and abroad.

Mr Strauss-Kahn, once a leading French Socialist who was tipped to become President, saw his career fall apart in 2011 when he was arrested for attempted rape.

Although he was later cleared of assaulting a chamber mate in a New York hotel room, numerous other allegations about the 64-year-old's sex life were also made public.

Now, in the tell-all interview to be broadcast in France tonight, Ms Sinclair said his court ordeal was a 'nightmare', adding: 'I know it sounds idiotic, but believe it or not, I didn't know' about his sordid sex life.

But Ms Sinclair, a multi-millionaire heiress and journalist, did concede: 'When I married Dominique, I knew he was a charmer, that he was a seducer. That I knew'.

Now Mr Strauss-Kahn faces trial on charges of aggravated pimping charges and could end up in prison.

He is said to have organised sex parties with prostitutes in France and America which judges have described as 'carnage on mattresses'.

In the 
France 2 interview, Ms Sinclair explains: 'I had doubts, yes, doubts 
that every couple has. I would often, sometimes, go to him, ask him if 
things were true or not.'

Pressed
 by interviewer Laurent Delahousse Ms Sinclair said: 'Listen, you can 
believe me or not, but I didn't know....Rumours are made to destroy, to 
kill, to damage - so I ignored them.'

Ms
 Sinclair said she never believed the claims of Nafissatou Diallo, the 
New York hotel maid whose allegations led to Strauss-Kahn's arrest and 
his resignation from the IMF.

'I didn't believe it, I don't believe it and I know it's not true,' said Ms Sinclair.

In
 2012, a civil lawsuit brought by Ms Diallo against Mr Strauss-Kahn was 
settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, said to be up to six 
million dollars.

Tristan Banon, a French writer, also accused Strauss-Kahn of attacking her 'like a rutting chimpanzee' in a Paris flat in 2003.

Preliminary charges of attempted rape were dropped in 2011 due to a three-year statute of limitations.

Asked how she got through the scandals involving her ex-husband, Ms Sinclair said: 'You know, when you have hurdles to jump, you just think about the next hurdle and ask - how am I going to make the next step?

'Looking at pictures from the courtroom, you ask yourself: 'How can I climb the next step'. You don't think about the three following ones.'

Mr Strauss-Kahn and 13 other defendants are due to be tried for their alleged roles in a prostitution ring operating out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, northern France.

Mr Strauss-Kahn now works as an economic consultant to a number of organisations including the governments of Serbia and South Sudan.
