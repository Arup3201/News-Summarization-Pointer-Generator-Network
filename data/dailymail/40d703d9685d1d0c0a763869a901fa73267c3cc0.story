A 'nervous, happy and desperate to get on with it' Nick Grimshaw made his debut as the new host of the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show today.

The Oldham-native, 28, took to the microphone at 6.30am for his first day, kicking off the show with Kanye West and Jay-Z's duet N***** In Paris.

Before his first track, Nick introduced himself: 'So this is happening, it's actually happening. Good morning Britain, I'm Nick Grimshaw.

New boy: Nick Grimshaw looks contemplative on his first day hosting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show

'It's time to follow in the footsteps
of people I like, like Chris Moyles and Sara Cox. I'm nervous, happy 
and desperate to get on with it.

'It's
time to start the difficult job of talking between records. I've been 
dreaming about this since I was a little boy. Let's do it.'

Nick's appointment in the role comes after previous breakfast show host Chris Moyles left following eight and half years.

Nick himself had previously hosted a late night show before his new role was announced in July.

Support: Fellow Radio 1 DJs (L-R) Scott Mills, Fearne Cotton, Dev, Zane Lowe and Huw Stephens came to visit

Although Nick played the radio edit 
of the foul-mouthed Jay-Z and Kanye track, he joked if he had played the 
unedited version it would have been 'the world's shortest stint on the Radio 1 breakfast show - three and a half minutes'.

Among
the celebrity guests on the show were his good friend Harry Styles, who
talked about One Direction's new video and album on the phone, and a 
pre-recorded interview with Justin Bieber.

Nick ended up teasing a mumbling Harry by playing a brief bit of the wrong track instead of One Direction's new song Live While We're Young, joking: 'Sorry, my finger slipped.'

After fellow Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton later noted Harry didn't sound too happy by Nick's 'slip-up', the new breakfast show host replied: 'After he said Radio 1 instead of Capital Radio by mistake at the Brit Awards, he needs us - where else is he going to go? "Oh I’m just popping into Heart" – I don’t think so!'

Time to get up! Nick was greeted by people in chicken costumes for his first morning on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show

Ahead of his arrival at the Radio 1 studios in central London, Nick was greeted outside the building by two people in chicken costumes, who gave him a year's supply of Kenco coffee to help him get up in the morning.

Speaking to Radio 1’s Newsbeat after the show, he said: “It feels weird, I feel a relief now, the first day is done and it was the first show. Obviously a lot of people were waiting to hear it and there was a lot of anticipation of what the show would sound like, so yes it’s good to get the first one done.

'Today I guess was a lot like an introduction and repeating myself, saying my name a lot. Tomorrow I can do a more regular show and tell a few more stories.'

On his own: Nick is the main star of the show, in contrast to Chris Moyles's 'zoo' format

'In between the celeb guests, Nick was funny, cool, collected, and played actual - gasp - music.' Now magazine

'Grimmy’s first show was fast-paced, full of celebrity banter and, most importantly, fun.' Daily Mirror

'A promising start – and a clear break from what went before. It was out with dad rock, cynicism and bloatedly self-indulgent banter; in with dance beats, youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music... The show has swapped one who prefers music to the sound of his own voice; one much more in touch with its target audience of teens and twentysomethings.' Daily Telegraph

'The message in the opening show – which was a likeable mix of music, self-deprecating chat, interaction on social media, interviews, silly features and funny, often quite bitchy quips – was that the power here has shifted and lies squarely in the music... A very promising, refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to retune.' The Guardian

The T4 presenter's new role on the breakfast show is a bid to lower Radio 1's demographic after a report by the BBC Trust found the station needed to work harder to attract younger listeners.

In research published last November, it was claimed the average Radio 1 listener was 32 and went up to 33 for 38-year-old Moyles' breakfast show.

In a bid to attract younger listeners, the music policy seems a lot younger, with a heavier dance influence than had been broadcast on Moyles' show.

Nick will aim to play between eight to 10 songs an hour - double the amount played on Moyles' show.

Instead of Moyles' 'zoo' format of his production team, the Grimes show will mostly feature his voice with more phone-ins from the audience.

Nick previously admitted he had problems
getting up in the morning and told his listeners he had bought a 
wake-up light that gradually uses light and bird song to wake him up 
gently in the morning.

Showing
there was no hard feelings, Chris actually sent a good luck gift to 
Nick, who read out the card live on air: 'Good luck with the new show, 
enjoy it see you soon, from Chris, former owner of the breakfast show.'

Nick told his listeners: 'Ahh! I texted him on holiday and said "Thank you for being nice to me in the paper."

'Chris replied, "You'll be great, but not as great as me."

'And
now he's sent me some cakes, thank you Christopher, very nice. No 
pressure. And weird to not listen to him in the morning! I used to be 
able to tell how late I was based on which feature.'

Friendly face: Nick's close friend Pixie Geldof and her dog paid a visit to the Radio 1 studios

One of his biggest cheerleaders was close friend Pixie Geldof, who woke up early to listen to her pal, before heading in to visit him at the studio at the end of his shift.

She
wrote on Twitter: 'Up early for @grimmers !!!!! So proud!!! Epic music 
at the beginning of the radio one breakfast show with NICK GRIMSHAW!

'@grimmers obsessed with when they say "radio 1 breakfast show with nick grimshaw" so emo.'

Among those to give him praise were veteran DJ Simon Mayo, who presented the R1 morning show from 1987-1993.

Simon tweeted: 'Nick Grimshaw sounding a lot less terrified and a lot more organised than I did. In 1987.'

End of an era: Chris Moyles and his team (L-R) Pippa Taylor Hackett, Dominic Byrne, Tina Daheley, Aled Jones, Freya Last and Comedy Dave on their last show on September 14
