Scott Simon allegedly pocket dialed 911 as he discussed following another man home and killing him

It really was a case of Dial M for Murder for a Florida man.

Scott Simon, 24, allegedly pocket dialed 911 as he discussed following another man home and killing him.

Minutes after making the call a 33-year-old man was shot while driving on the I-95.

The car then crashed into the centre guard rail and exploded in flames.

The deadly shooting of Nicholas Walker and subsequent fire on May 5th shut down the busy road in Lauderill, south Florida for about three hours.

Police were able to connect Simon to the shooting from the 'butt dialed' call he accidentally made

Detectives do not believe he fired the shots at Walker, but that he was heavily involved in the crime after getting into an argument and fight earlier in a Waffle House restaurant.

Simon's call was recorded by police.

Officials said it will not be released, but on the tape Simon is alleged to have said heâ€™s going to follow the victim home and kill him.

Detectives have appealed for help in tracing another suspect in the murder.

They have released surveillance video of another man they believe to be involved.

That suspect and a third man were in a black 2012 Buick GS in the early-morning hours of May 5.

footage released by Broward Sheriff's Office shows men arguing outside 
the Waffle House as several witnesses looked on.

Police also released images of the car they are trying to trace.

Simon, of Pompano Beach, Florida, has been charged with first degree murder.

In the classic Hitchcock film 'Dial M for Murder' a man arranges for his wife be killed by luring her to the phone.

The 1954 film starred Ray Milland and Grace Kelly.
