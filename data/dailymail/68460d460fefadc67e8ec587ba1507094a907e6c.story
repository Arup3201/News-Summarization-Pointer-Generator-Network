'Painful lessons': Twenty-year-old Aimee Costello (pictured) died after taking the former legal high M-Cat on a night out last year

A coroner issued a stark warning today about the 'savage legacy' of a former legal high known as M-Cat after a young woman died from taking the drug.

Aimee Costello, 20, snorted the class B drug after drinking vodka and Red Bull on a night out.

The following day, she complained that her heart 'felt funny' before collapsing and dying.

Two of her former friends were handed suspended prison sentences today after they admitted supplying her the drug, which is also called mephedrone.

Assistant Deputy Coroner Kevin McLoughlin recorded a verdict of non-dependent abuse of drugs and warned: 'Inquests can draw painful lessons from tragedy and I hope this tragic story does that.

'I hope the lesson here is that these people seemed to have no appreciation that their actions were putting themselves at risk.

'Other people tempted to take M-Cat must realise that they might not be alive at the end of the day.

'Young people can be very cavalier about death, but their thoughts may change if they know the devastating effects Aimee's death has left upon her family.

'It is indeed a savage legacy.'

An inquest in Leeds, West Yorkshire, heard that the night before her death on April 4 last year , Aimee had gone to a friend's house, where the two had drunk vodka and red bull before going out to a club.

At around 2am, Aimee arrived at Jessica Hooks's house where another friend, Kirstie McInnes, was already there.

The four snorted M-Cat, which was initially distributed as a so-called legal high before it was banned in 2010 following calls from campaigners.

Hooks told the inquest yesterday: 'In the afternoon, she kept saying that her heart felt funny. She was catching her breath.

'At around 5.30pm we were just sitting round watching TV when Aimee just flopped down. At first, we thought she was joking, but then she started fitting.

'I grabbed her and she just flopped. She went really grey. I think she was unconscious.

'We all just freaked out. We laid her on the floor. Kirstie rang for an ambulance and they were telling her how to do CPR.'

An ambulance was called and despite 
working on Aimee for half-an-hour she did not respond, so they took her 
to St James's Hospital, where she was met by her frantic mother, who had
 been informed. She was pronounced dead at 8.40pm.

A court heard today that after Aimee's death, Hooks began to clear the house of evidence, ringing the dealer to come and collect the rest of his supply, which he did.

But her 'unsophisticated' efforts did not stop police from finding the drugs bag and 'glossy catalogues' which had been used to snort the drugs.

Hooks also sent a text to another friend who had been at the party, asking them to 'get Aimee's phone', but the police had already arrived and seized the phone along with other evidence.

The pair later gave statements to the police claiming the drugs had arrived with Aimee.

Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said that after further investigations both defendants were arrested and made full admissions.

Hooks, 21, pleaded guilty to supplying a 
class B drug and McInnes, 22, admitted to the concern and supply of a 
class B drug. Both also admitted perverting the course of justice.

They sobbed in the dock as they were handed prison sentences of ten and six months respectively, both suspended for 18 months, at Leeds Crown Court.

Judge Geoffrey Marson QC told them: 'If ever a case demonstrated the dangerousness of even class B drugs this is it.

'Many people seem to think that drugs like this, of the M-cat genre, are harmless. They are dangerous. And as this case demonstrates they can kill.'

A statement released by Aimee's parents Phillip and Heather after the case said: 'We have recently had the first anniversary of our beautiful youngest daughter Aimee and we are still in shock and disbelief that she is gone.

'To say we are devastated is an understatement and the thought that we will never see her again has left us broken.

'The loss of our bright, bubbly and loving girl has ripped our family apart and we, her sisters, and wider family, will never recover from it.

'She is our first thought on waking and our last thought before sleep. She was a beautiful, fun-loving and caring girl who we miss very much.

'We hope that Aimee's death will serve as a warning against so-called party drugs as they can kill just as easily as drugs that are traditionally regarded as dangerous.'
