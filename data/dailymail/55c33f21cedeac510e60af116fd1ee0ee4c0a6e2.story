It is a picture of elegance  and decorum: a group whose members are at ease in the most exclusive dining rooms and salons of the capital.

Yet behind the smiles of  these society figures lie tensions and rivalries which will be exposed on a new reality show, dubbed ‘the biggest celebrity catfight ever caught on camera’. It will be screened this summer.

Even posher than Made In Chelsea, Ladies of London is supposed to be a compelling account of the lives of established – and very glamorous – businesswomen as they manoeuvre their way around the social circuit.

High society catfight: From left to right Caroline Stanbury, Marissa Hermer, Juliet Angus, Caprice Bourret, Annabelle Neilson and Noelle Reno will all feature in the reality television series

And manners are forgotten when British socialites go head-to-head with ambitious American ‘upstarts’.

The home-grown toffs sneer at their US rivals while American socialite Juliet Angus observes: ‘The British women have sticks up their a****.’

It’s time to meet the combatants.

Caroline Stanbury, 38: Miss Perfect

Born into the Vestey food dynasty, 
Caroline has dated Hugh Grant  and Sylvester Stallone. She is now 
married to Turkish financier Cem Habib.

A successful businesswoman in her own right, she is said to be worth about £20 million.

The socialite and former squeeze of Prince Andrew boasts of Royal connections, behaves as if she were the main star and poses for a 12-page spread in a glossy magazine.

Her clipped accent and polished appearance irritate cast members, who brand her ‘Miss Perfect’.

She falls out with fellow participant and former best friend, American former glamour model Caprice Bourret, but is unrepentant. ‘Two cultures. One city,’ she remarks snootily.

Then she acidly attacks designer Noelle Reno for wearing a hat to the Audi Polo Challenge, snidely remarking: ‘You look like Cruella De Vil.’

Marissa Hermer, 31: The Honorary Brit

American Marissa Hermer is the 'Honorary Brit'. She is rarely seen without a Chanel handbag and works for her husband Matt Hermer's business. Mr Hermer owns Boujis nightclub and the Bumpkin restaurant chain

Marissa, who is rarely seen without a Chanel handbag, works as special projects director for her husband’s family business the Ignite Group, which owns Boujis nightclub and the Bumpkin restaurant chain.

The couple are worth up to £25 million. The bubbly girl-about-town manages to become everyone’s friend.

‘Marissa was cast as the super-pretty girl next door and wholesome American,’ says an insider. ‘She is really well connected and arranged for some of the show to be filmed at her husband’s VIP venues.’

Juliet Angus, 36: Social Operator

Juliet Angus is the 'Social Operator'. Chicago-born Juliet works in PR and is married to media executive Gregor Angus

It is not a crime to want to be famous, but Chicago-born Juliet’s co-stars felt like slamming her in the stocks.

Confrontational, brash and with a grating nasal twang, she managed to irritate every other cast member.

‘If there was a real culture clash  it was personified in Juliet,’ says an insider. ‘She was trying to find her way into British society and it wasn’t always a smooth path.

‘They fell out over parties and who got invited to what. There were some major bitch fights over who was most famous.’

Juliet moved to London in 2010, and is married to media executive Gregor Angus.

The couple are worth between £30 million and £40 million, but it’s mainly her husband’s money.

Caprice Bourret, 42: Glamour Mom

Caprice Bourret is the 'Glamour Mom'. She is believed to be worth between £15million and £20million and is a former glamour model

The former glamour model has appeared in more than 300 magazines around the globe, and now runs her own line of lingerie, swimwear and bedding.

Believed to be worth between £15 million and £20 million, she  lives with 47-year-old Ty Comfort, who comes from a wealthy American banking family, in Notting Hill.

She made headlines last year after it was revealed she was having a baby with Ty while, at the same time, a surrogate mother was pregnant with their child in America.

The series shows Caprice conducting a fierce rivalry with British participant Caroline Stanbury over who gets the most airtime and  more publicity for their respective businesses.

‘Caprice would get upset if Caroline was plugging her business too much,’ says a source.

‘And Caroline was just as bad. They had a long-running feud and no one even knows if they are talking now.’ 

Annabelle Nielson, 45: Queen of Cool

Annabelle Neilson is the 'Queen of Cool'. She is the former wild child who achieved notoriety for her brief marriage to Nat Rothschild

Former wild child Annabelle achieved notoriety for her brief marriage to financier Nat Rothschild after they met on a beach in India and eloped to Las Vegas. Today she counts Kate Moss, Sadie Frost and Naomi Campbell among her closest friends and is said to be worth about £20 million.

With an elegant and understated manner, she becomes a star of the show – until breaking her pelvis falling off a racehorse.

There’s no sympathy from Juliet Angus, who attacks her for missing so much filming.

Noelle Reno, 30: Life of the Party

Noelle Reno is the 'Life of the Party'. Seattle-born Noelle is said to be worth £5million and is a presenter for Fashion TV

Seattle-born Noelle moved to London when she was 20 and is one of the Americans who really wants to be British.

The former model, said to be worth £5million, now works as a presenter for Fashion TV and also in jewellery PR.

In her private life, Noelle has displayed a taste for wayward men.  The Pucci-wearing socialite had been engaged to US banking heir Matthew Mellon after his split  from Jimmy Choo founder Tamara Mellon.

Now though, she maintains an  on-off relationship with millionaire Scot Young, who was briefly jailed last year after failing to disclose his assets in the course of an acrimonious divorce case.Don’t miss the fascinating  Noelle Reno interview  in today’s You magazine
