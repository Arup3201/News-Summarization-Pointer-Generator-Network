Foreign Secretary William Hague today told MPs in the House of Commons that the Government has decided to recognise the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the 'sole legitimate representative' of the Syrian people

Britain today recognised a coalition of Syrian rebels as the ‘sole legitimate representative’ of the Syrian people, clearing the way to offer arms in the battle to help overthrow President Assad.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons it was in the UK’s interests to endorse the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces.

He condemned the ‘barbaric violence’ which had led to the death of 30,000 people and refused to rule out any option ‘that might save innocent lives in Syria’.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm 
Rifkind said Britain’s recognition of the rebels ‘removes a major 
barrier to the supply of defensive military equipment to the Syrian 
resistance’.

But other MPs warned against military intervention by UK troops.

Mr
Hague met with leaders of the National Coalition last week.

He said the
coalition had promised to leave the door open to other opposition 
groups which wanted to join them, to appeal to Syrians from all 
communities and to be a ‘moderate political force committed to 
democracy’ that would not repeat President Assad's abuses.

‘On
the basis of the assurances I received during consultations with my 
European partners yesterday, Her Majesty's Government has decided to 
recognise the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition 
Forces as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people,’ he 
said in a statement in the Commons.

Foreign Secretary William Hague today announced Britain would officially recognise the Syrian rebels, after meeting with President Sheikh Ahmed Moaz Al-Khatib of the Syrian opposition movement last week

He also announced a ‘significant increase’ in practical support for the Syrian opposition. 

The rebels will be invited to appoint a political representative to the UK – similar to an ambassador.

He also promised £1 million in communications support, which could help create mobile internet hubs and satellite phones.

A
stabilisation response team will be deployed to the region and 
International Development Secretary Justine Greening is looking to 
increase funding to Syrians affected by the conflict.

Mr Hague faced calls to arm the Syrian rebels from former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind

Mr Hague added: ‘A credible alternative to the Assad regime is emerging that has the growing support of the Arab League, the European Union, the United States and an increasing number of other countries; and we have an agreed basis for a transition in the form of the Geneva Communique which all permanent members of the United Nations Security Council signed up to in June.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the recognition of the rebels removed a major barrier to arming them

'But in the absence of that political and diplomatic solution, we will not rule out any option in accordance with international law that might save innocent lives in Syria and prevent the destabilisation of a region that remains critical to the security of the United Kingdom and the peace of the whole world.’

But he faced calls from the government benches to move quickly in providing military support. The current arms embargo expires on December 1.

Sir Malcolm, who was Defence Secretary and Foreign Secretary under John Major, warned that the rebels in Syria had no hope without any defensive equipment.

He told Mr Hague: 'Do you agree the emergence of the Syrian National Coalition and the Government's welcome recognition of it today removes a major barrier to the supply of defensive military equipment to the Syrian resistance?

‘Will you look at this constructively and will you recognise that what you describe rightly as the barbaric violence of the Syrian regime against the civilian communities will not come to an end unless and until the Syrian resistance are able to defend themselves?’

But Mr Hague insisted there was ‘no automatic change in our policy’ because of the recognition of the Syrian opposition but had discussed the issues with the French foreign minister.

‘The arms embargo is due to be continued from December 1 as part of the entire package of Syria sanctions.

‘We will keep all these options under review but we have made no decision to change our policy on arms supplies as things stand.’
