What do you get when you combine an Einstein puppet, Bohemian Rhapsody and string theory?

McGill University student, Timothy Blais, recently found out in a hilarious video that has gone viral.

With remarkably smooth harmonies, Blais explains the tricky concept of string theory to the tune of  Queen’s most famous song.

The ‘Bohemian Gravity’ video doesn’t mess around. Right from the start he poses the ultimate questions, ‘Is string theory real? Is it just fantasy?’

An Einstein sock puppet joins the chorus to help explain string theory how string theory could solve one of the biggest mysteries of the universe; how gravity and quantum physics work fit together.

In just a couple of days, the YouTube video racked up more than 270,000 views, and currently has over 1,400,000 views.

At its most basic level, string theory, also known as the ‘theory of 
everything,’ proposes that all objects in our universe are composed of 
vibrating filaments (strings) and membranes of energy.

The theory 
suggests that each so-called fundamental particle contains a tiny, 
vibrating, one-dimensional loop of string.  The vibration of the string 
determines the charge and mass of the greater particle.

String theory
works in ten or eleven dimensions and we only experience four. 
Scientists have theorised that the missing dimensions are curled up into
a compact space.  If the space is tiny, on the scale of the strings, 
then we would be unable to detect them.

Or as, Timothy Blais put its,
‘to get down to 4D we compactify. Oh, Kahler! Manifolds must be Kahler!
If we wanna preserve, any of our super-symmetry.’

Scientists are 
hopeful that string theory will solve one of the biggest mysteries of 
the universe; how gravity and quantum physics work fit together.

23-year-old Blais has completed his master's degree at McGill University in Montreal, Canada with a  thesis titled ‘A new quantisation condition for parity-violating three-dimensional gravity.’

He recently told his Twitter followed that he was putting his studies on hold for a while to focus on his music career.

‘I've been in school all my life so I'm switching gears and being a musician this year!’ he said.

‘Bohemian Gravity’ isn’t Blais’ first foray into music. Last year, the fresh-faced student recorded ‘Rolling in the Higgs,’ a scientific riff on Adele’s song.

According to Blais’ Facebook page, these ‘science-parody creations are 100 per cent originally recorded and made out of unaltered sounds from his mouth, throat and vocal cords.’

The video became popular at CERN, the Geneva research facility where the Higgs Boson particle - which underpins the accepted standard model of the universe - was found.

At the time, Blais told AFP: 'I'm kind of amazed by the feedback.

‘One student from Spain told me his supervisor called my video: "The only good thing to come out of the Higgs discovery so far". I'm flattered.'
