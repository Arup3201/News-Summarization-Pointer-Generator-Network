Nursery nurse Donna Turner has been refused the chance to have her dead husband’s baby because NHS bosses said it would make her a single parent.

Mrs Turner last night told how she had been refused IVF treatment using sperm taken from her husband of only eight months.

Surgeons had even reversed Paul Turner’s vasectomy as he lay dying from bowel cancer, just months after the couple married, so the sperm could be harvested and frozen to fulfil the couple’s desperate wish to have a baby.

Donna Turner has been denied the chance to have her dead husband Paul's baby, after NHS bosses refused her £3,500 IVF treatment, on the grounds she is now single

Mrs Turner said NHS staff had turned her down for IVF treatment because, as a widow, she was officially single.

The 32-year-old married Mr Turner, 39, in April 2012, but just eight months later he died. Having already discussed names for their unborn child, Mr Turner’s dying wish was for his wife to have it using his frozen sperm.

However, just months after his death, Mrs Turner was denied the £3,500 treatment by her local NHS commissioning group.

Still wearing his wedding ring on a chain around her neck, Mrs Turner said: ‘I wanted his child more than anything. I promised him on his death bed.

‘For the names, it was going to be Paignton-Louise for a girl and Tommy for a boy.

Eight months after the couple married in April 2012, Mr Turner died after being diagnosed with bowel cancer. While on his deathbed, the 39-year-old asked doctors to reverse his vasectomy and harvest his sperm so his wife could undergo IVF

Local clinical commissioning groups across the UK decide whether to fund IVF on the NHS.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has a set of guidelines on treatment for fertility problems.

It recommends up to three IVF cycles should be available on the NHS if:

The woman is aged between 23 and 39 at the time of treatment and:

Women aged 40-42 who have not conceived after two years of regular, unprotected sex or after 12 cycles of artificial insemination should be offered one IVF cycle if the following criteria are met:

Implementation of the guidance by CCGs varies as it is not mandatory.Additional criteria, used by some CCGs, includes:

‘Then the Clinical Commissioning Group refused to fund me. They told me the policy means they can only give the treatment to couples, so because I’m a widow living on my own I’m not allowed to have the treatment. It’s crazy. I would have a husband if he hadn’t died.

‘I’m not single, I’m widowed.’

The decision has left Mrs Turner, of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, trying to save up for the treatment, but she says that could take years.

‘All I was asking them for was one little bit of help,’ she said. ‘I feel really angry because they’re letting women have boob jobs and tummy tucks on the NHS but won’t help someone like me.

‘I didn’t ask to be a widow. I would either be pregnant or have the baby by now if Paul had been here.

‘I look at pregnant people now and I think “why is that not me?” It should have been me pushing a pram now or with a bump.’

The couple met on New Year’s Day 2010, and Mr Turner proposed the following New Year’s Eve.

They married in Milton Keynes in April 2012, but just five months later, Mr Turner was diagnosed with bowel cancer and, despite originally being told he could have more than 18 months to live, he died in January 2013.

Mrs Turner said: ‘As he was  slipping away I held his hand and told him I loved him and I promised him I would have the child  and take them to Devon like  we planned.

‘On the last breath I saw a little tear roll down his face and then he was gone.’ Mrs Turner’s mother, Lee Payne, 56, said the experience had been incredibly difficult for  the family.

She said: ‘My daughter hasn’t chosen to be in this situation. She always wanted to be a mum and have a child with the husband she loves, the man of her dreams.

‘He brought some life into our house and children loved him, he was like the Pied Piper. Nobody ever said a bad word about him.

‘When they turned her down for the IVF like that, I was so upset and angry.

‘I couldn’t help my daughter to save her husband but this is one thing I can try to do for her.’

Milton Keynes Clinical Commissioning Group associate director Janet Corbett said its policy of not commissioning IVF for single parents was in line with other CCGs in the East Midlands.

Miss Corbett added: ‘The policy is for use when a couple have a medical reason for being unable to conceive a child.’

Josie Cunningham from Leeds, had a boob job on the NHS to boost her confidence

The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million.

Many
 of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the 
increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses.

In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life.

The
 former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it 
emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job at the same NHS Trust 
that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to 
walk.

She later claimed her
 breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she 
found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction.

And
 barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was 
given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the 
£5,000 procedure.

He now 
says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, 
including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and 
jaw reshaped.

The obesity 
epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of 
liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in 
ten years.

The cost in the 
most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS 
Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000.

There
 has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid 
surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is 
supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision.

And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not
 based on strict medical needs.’

The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail.

It also showed that up to 
£20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on 
tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have 
declined over the past decade.

Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’

Roger
 Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of 
cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort 
where someone is just trying to look better.

'We
 agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer 
affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered 
affordable at all.’
