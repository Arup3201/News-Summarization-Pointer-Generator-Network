A mother's grief: Karen de la Carriere said her son disowned in 2010 after she left Scientology

The mother of 27-year-old Scientologist Alexander Jentzsch, did not find out that her son died until days later, and said that she won’t be allowed to see her son’s body at the morgue. 

Karen de la Carriere, who was once married to current Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and left the Church in 2010, said that Alexander’s wife, who is also a Scientologist, is refusing to let the grieving mother view her son’s body. 

She also said that she was not informed of her son’s death for days, and had to find out from a friend, later confirming Alexander’s death with the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office of her son’s passing.

‘They didn’t inform me, they didn’t inform Herber,’ she told the Village Voice.

Heber Jentzsch has not been seen in public for nearly a decade, one of several high-profile Scientology members removed from the public eye. The wife of church leader David Miscavige, Michelle ‘Shelly’ Barnett, has not been seen since 2007.

Ms de la Carriere did not immediately return requests for comment from the MailOnline, but told the Village Voice in an emotional conversation the details surrounding her son’s death.

She said that Alexander ‘had a high fever, and the next morning, he was icy cold and he was dead,’ the mother said, adding that he was on pain killers for a back injury obtained in a car accident.

Ms de la Carriere told the Voice: ‘The dead body of the son of the president of the Church of Scientology has been sitting in a morgue for days, and they didn’t tell me because I’m a declared SP.’

She was excommunicated after she left the Church, and was branded a ‘suppressive person,’ the Voice reported.

She told RadarOnline.com that Alexander’s wife, Andrea, refuses to let her see her son’s body.

When Ms de la Carriere sent a friend over to their home with a letter for Andrea, the friend was turned away with the message, ‘All communication goes through the Office of Special Affairs.’

The mother told the Village Voice that the Church created a ‘hate website’ about her, and coerced Alexander to cut all ties with her.

She said that he was spoon fed what to tell her, including the words: ‘Never phone me, never e-mail me. Until you get your s*** together, we can have no communication.  'Until then, we are disconnected.’

The mother added: ‘For two years, he disconnected from me, and now he’s dead.’

She found out three days after the fact that her son had died from former Scientology spokesman Mike Rinder.

Apparently, Andrea had told some of her Scientology friends on Facebook about Alexander’s death, and the news eventually tricked down to Rinder, who currently lives in Florida, RadarOnline.com reported.

Once told by Mr Rinder, Ms de la Carriere called the coroner’s office, which solidly confirmed her son’s death.

In an explosive tell all published on a friend’s blog in 2010, Ms de la Carriere revealed her struggle with the religion, and explained how Alexander, who was born in 1984, was inculcated with the beliefs of Scientology from infancy.

president of the Church of Scientology has been sitting in a morgue for 
days, and they didn’t tell me because I'm a declared SP.'

According to her, Alexander was a member of Sea Org for more than a decade.

She also wrote of the policies surrounding Scientology and reproduction.

Alexander’s wife, Andrea, became pregnant in 2007. She wrote in the post: ‘Pressure is brought to bear for an abortion. It is done skilfully – no heavy threats, but both are taken off post to look at “the greatest good…” In the end, Andrea had an abortion and they were returned to post.’

Ms de la Carriere said in a 2011 interview that she and then-husband Heber had to petition for a second child, a newly-ordained rule at the time.

She said she wanted a girl. ‘A new had come out that you had to petition to have a baby,' she explained. 'And along with the petition, you were to name why should be allowed to have a baby.’

Ms de la Carriere said that though she and her husband petitioned for three months, their petition was denied. She also said that her husband was beaten for making the request.

She again became pregnant three years later. 

A spokesperson from the Church of Scientology International told MailOnline: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Heber Jentzsch and his entire family during this difficult time.

‘The Church takes offense at the irresponsible and false claims from excommunicated self-promoters who are sadly exploiting private family matters for their own personal financial gain.’

Hollywood split: The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, pictured

The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise.

In light of the rumours that Cruise’ devotion to Scientology- and his supposed desire to enrol Suri in one of the religion’s intense boot camps - was one of the main causes for their split,  two senior Church administrators sent a panicked email giving followers advice on how to counter the negative press storm.

The letter comes the day after one of the most noted ‘defectors’ from the religion predicted that Cruise’ latest divorce could be the ‘biggest nightmare in the Church of Scientology’s history’ because of the drama that could unfold if secrets are publicly revealed in court.

Scientology was developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1952. Their website reads: ‘The ultimate goal of Scientology is true spiritual enlightenment and freedom for all.’
