A judge has halted work on the Brazil stadium where England will play their opening World Cup game after two workers died in separate incidents in less than ten hours, it was reported today.

Construction worker Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, was killed in the early hours on Saturday after falling 115 feet from the roof of the Amazonas Arena in Manaus, northern Brazil.

And just before lunchtime the same day another labourer, Jose Nascimento, 49, died of a heart attack while working on another part of the stadium complex.

Family members later complained that he had been working without any days off because of pressure to deliver the venue to Fifa on time.

The stadium, in Brazil's jungle state of Amazonas, is due to host England's opening match on June 15 against Italy.

But last night a judge ordered all work to be halted on the stadium until authorities can be satisfied no more workers' lives are being put at risk.

Maria Nely Bezerra de Oliveira said the death of Mr Ferreira was identical to another fatality in March this year, when another worker fell 16 feet from scaffolding above the stadium.

She revealed that health and safety inspectors had made 114 reports of serious work law violations since construction began on the venue.

She said: 'Because of the risks inherent with this type of development, we have constantly monitored the work.

'But despite the relentless work of the authorities, we have nevertheless witnessed the repeated noncompliance with work laws.

'Now with the death of yet another worker, we believe it is time to take action to prevent further tragedy.'

Construction firm Andrade Gutierrez will face a Â£40,000 for every day they do not comply with the order, she added.

And workers must continue to receive their full salaries, however long work at the stadium - due to be inaugurated on January 15 - remains at a standstill.

Fears the stadium may not be ready in time for England's opener were raised further after a union leader last night threatened to call for a strike.

Cicero Custodio, who represents workers at the stadium, told Brazil's Globo G1 website that the rush to get the building finished was putting lives at risk.

The claim was repeated by the family of Mr Nascimento, who died after suffering a heart attack while working on the stadium complex.

His daughter-in-law, Priscila Soares, claimed: 'He worked from Sunday to Sunday. He was always under pressure to work quicker and harder because work was behind schedule.'

The deaths came barely a fortnight after two people died at the World Cup stadium in Sao Paulo, where England will play Uruguay in their second group match.

And they take the death toll during Brazil's World Cup preparations to six as the country races to be ready for the event.

Last year, another worker died at the site of a stadium in the country's capital, Brasilia.

Construction firm Andrade Gutierrez said an investigation of Saturday's incident would immediately be opened.
