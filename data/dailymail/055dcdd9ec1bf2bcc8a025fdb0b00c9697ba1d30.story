A family visiting a drive-through safari park got a closer encounter than they bargained for when a camel poked its head in their car.

Driver Ryan Duckworth while visiting a local safari park with his family when the hilarious wildlife encounter took place.

Calling out 'It's humpday!' as he drives slowly past the camel, the serviceman is caught by surprise when the camel suddenly pokes its head in his car window, looking for food. 

YouTube user Ryan Duckworth lures the camel over to the vehicle with a tasty treat in his palm

The animal quickly pops its head into the open car window and reaches in even further to eat the snack

The clip was uploaded to YouTube by Ryan, a member of the U.S. Army who is based in Fort Hood, Texas.

While it's unclear where the video was filmed, it could possibly be at the local Topsey Exotic Ranch - a drive-through safari park, quite nearby to Fort Hood, in Coryell County, Texas. 

In the hilarious video, the driver tosses a packet of snacks onto his front seat companion's lap - and the camel reaches his long neck into the vehicle even further to retrieve it.

Meanwhile, the entire car screeches in surprise.

The camel doesn't just stop with the crisps, however, he takes the entire paper bag out of the vehicle

Ryan and his family erupt into laughter as the animal chows down on everything in sight

Laughter erupts as the camel pulls the paper bag out of the car and devours it in just a couple of swallows.

'He just wrecked the whole thing!' the videographer chuckles as the camel chows down.

The friendly camel hangs out around the car window while he finishes his snack and even allows the driver of the vehicle to give him a few pats.

As he finishes his snack, the family thinks that the camel will head off.. but they couldn't be more wrong!

The animal soon pops his head back in - this time, gnawing on the driver's arm - while the entire car screeches with laughter

And just when you think the camel is done visiting with the family, he pops his head back in once more - looking for any leftovers of the snack he just enjoyed.

Instead, he manages to latch on to the driver's left arm, causing everyone in the car to laugh even harder.

'The camel wanted all the food,' Ryan wrote under the video on YouTube. 'My arm included!'
