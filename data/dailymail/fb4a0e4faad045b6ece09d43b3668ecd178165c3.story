A Premier League footballer cleared of gang rape allegations has lashed out at women he sees as targeting wealthy footballers as cash cows.

French international Loic Remy, who plays for Newcastle United, says wannabe WAGs go after players like him for their cash - however they can get it.

'These girls are vicious and greedy,' 
he told The Sun's Rachel Dale, in his first public comments on his ordeal since he was
 first arrested nine months ago.

'Nightmare': Newcastle United striker Loic Remy has hit out of 'vicious and greedy' women who target footballers

Twenty-seven-year-old
 Remy was one of three men last year accused of the champagne-fuelled 
gang rape of a 34-year-old woman at his rented flat in Fulham, West 
London.

He denied the allegation, and last month the Metropolitan Police finally said there would be no further action taken against him.

He admitted he should have been smarter, but said: 'When you're a footballer, single and want to have fun, you can have any girl you want.

'Before it was not like that. I see things that make me afraid. I see these girls - what they can do.'

Remy's accuser claimed that he, his cousin and his friend raped her last May 6, Bank Holiday Monday, at his £2million rented flat at Marina Point, Imperial Wharf.

It was claimed the woman visited the fourth-floor flat where she was said to have been offered champagne before being raped.

After the alleged assault, it is understood the woman travelled to Kent where she reported the attack to police the following day. They in turn passed on the details to the Met.

Speaking of the moment police stormed 
his home, Remy said: 'When you are woken up at 5am by seven or 
eight police, you think it's a dream or a nightmare.'

Magician: The allegation has not dented Remy's form, he has scored 13 times in his last 24 matches

The allegation has not damaged Remy's form on the pitch. While still on police bail, the striker moved from Queen's Park Rangers to Newcastle United on loan, where he has scored 13 times in 24 appearances.

Remy joined QPR in January for a club-record fee of £8million from Marseille. He earns a salary of £80,000 a week.

He was born in Lyon, where he was brought up on a tough council estate. As a child his hero was Arsenal star Thierry Henry and he was encouraged to become a footballer by a neighbour after his father left the family home.
