Liverpool's hero against Arsenal, Martin Skrtel, is one of 13 defensive players  with doubts surrounding their long-term futures at the club.

At present, it seems certain there will be another overhaul at Anfield next summer.

The Slovakian, who scored an injury-time equaliser against the Gunners on Sunday, has 18 months left on his contract, while Glen Johnson, Kolo Toure, Brad Jones, Jon Flanagan and Brad Smith are all out of contract in June.

Sebastian Coates, Andre Wisdom, Thiago Ilori are out on loan, with Mamadou Sakho, Jose Enrique and Simon Mignolet struggling for form.

Javier Manquillo, who is on loan from Atletico Madrid, could return to the Spanish side.

Liverpool have not opened talks with Johnson, while discussions about a new deal for Flanagan are pending while he recovers from the cartilage operation that has prevented him playing this season. 

Toure, however, is desperate to prove he can stay beyond next summer. The Ivorian has played well since getting his place back place in the team and he said: 'I have not heard anything but, of course, I would like to stay. I always try and do my best for this club.'

Skrtel, meanwhile, believes Liverpool have shown signs of revival in their last three fixtures after a poor first half of the season.

Speaking after the 2-2 draw with Arsenal, he said: 'In the last three games against Manchester United, Bournemouth and Arsenal we have shown great performances and we need to keep going this way and it will be good for us and results will be better. We showed that spirit, fight, desire. It is a good point but we wanted more.

'To get a point was reward for fighting to the end. The goal and the performance can help turn things around because there has been a lot of criticism of us and I hope it will change and be better in the second half of the season.'
