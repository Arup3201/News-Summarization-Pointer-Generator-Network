Eden Hazard has heaped praise on Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, and says it is 'a pleasure to play with them'.

Chelsea's two high-profile summer signings have hit the ground running as Jose Mourinho's side set the early season pace in the Premier League.

And last season's star Hazard claims it took just a week of training for him to get used to playing with the two Spain internationals.

Eden Hazard has been excellent so far for Chelsea, terrorizing defenders during his side's superb start 

The signings of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have been vital in Chelsea's early-season success

'The time it takes to develop a relationship on the pitch depends on the guy,' Hazard told the Evening Standard. 'Sometimes it's quick, sometimes not. 

'But it's easy for me to play with them because they understand football and are very good players. We didn't need to train two years together, just one week was enough. They know when I move and I know when Costa and Fabregas move. It's a pleasure to play with them.'

Hazard says it took just one week to adapt to the two Spain internationals, because 'they understand football'

Costa is currently missing through injury, but has scored nine goals in as many games since joining

The Belgian winger, who has also been in superb form so far this season, also targeted a treble for his Chelsea side this season.  

'I don't know how much better this team can get — we will see. Now we are first in the table and I hope we can stay there until the end of the season. I hope we can win a lot of trophies this season, one, two or three. Why not?'

Hazard believe Jose Mourinho's side can continue to improve and might even win three trophies this season
