The controversial king of Paleo has revealed that he loves what he sees  in the mirror.

Celebrity chef Pete Evans says he looks and feels younger than ever thanks to a complete lifestyle transformation after converting to the contentious 'caveman diet'.

'I see a very young teenage boy looking back at me,' he told Sunday Life magazine.

'It's exciting because five years ago I was looking at myself, going, "F*** Pete, you are looking old!" 

The 41-year-old says he was feeling lethargic and bloated before cutting out grains, sugar and dairy as part of his Paleo regime, which was voted as one of the worst diets of 2014.

Fellow My Kitchen Rules judge Manu Feildel admits he misses ordering enough for 12 people with his old pal

'Five years ago I was looking at myself, going, "F*** Pete, you are looking old!" Evans says of the way he looked back in 2010 (pictured right) 

The My Kitchen Rules judge shrugs off the overwhelming amount of flack he receives for advocating the strict diet which includes him not drinking coffee because it's a stimulant.

'Pete bashing has become a sort of national pastime,' he said with a laugh.

Evans insists that he doesn't miss the fatty and rich food that he used to eat but friend and fellow MKR judge, Manu Feildel, admits he misses ordering enough for 12 people with his old pal.

'Show me some evidence that this does not work. Show me all the people who are getting sick from adopting this way. You are not going to find it.' 

Experts have described the diet as potentially dangerous which gets Evans' blood boiling saying if it could be proven that Paleo put people at risk then he would eat his 'f***** hat'.

But the French chef also admires his mate adding: 'It takes balls to do that.' 

'He is very healthy in every way, but I do feel scared a little about it because he is going to the extreme of that diet.'

Going one step further, Evans says people need to consider how eating grains can affect the health of future generations.

'I'm going to cop a lot of grief for this but if you want to look at it from a generational or an observational viewpoint of our species, we are producing weaker and weaker offspring as the generations progress,' he said. 

Evans also believes food such as 'inhumanely raised meat' and 'conventional dairy products' should be banned from every kitchen.

From cheap bread, sugary cereals to processed foods made from refined carbohydrates and sugars, the Sydney chef shares his controversial beliefs on what healthy eating means to him.

Evans sparked a food war against concerned health experts for promoting the 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy.

But the father-of-two said not only is he in the best shape of his life – he's also the happiest he's ever been. 

'Critics don't really seem to grasp what Paleo is,' Evans told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's not a diet, nor is it nutritionally incompetent nor is it a fad. All these labels serve to do is disconnect Paleo far away from its reality.

'At its heart, Paleo is a way of life and a balanced approach to returning to eat the most natural foods available, straight from the source.

'Scientific research shows that by consuming what our ancestors and modern-day hunter-gatherer tribes continue to consume today, we can take back control of our health and live a life of optimal wellness.

'These societies don't tend to suffer from the modern chronic diseases that plague the developed world and for me that's powerful information worth investigating.'

The Paleo style of eating has been sweeping across the globe with its focus on high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruit, seeds and nuts.

'Paleo is very beneficial,' Evans said.

'It's a way of returning to a far more natural way of eating and a way of using the foods you eat to drive optimal health and balance in your body.

'By ditching refined carbohydrates and sugars and replacing them with moderate amounts of protein, good-quality fats and lots of nutrient-dense vegetables, you'll have energy to burn.

'And you can concentrate for long periods without experiencing the brain fogginess and blood sugar roller-coaster ride that comes with eating a diet full of refined carbs and sugars.'

Banned from the cupboard: 4. Conventional dairy products 5. Inhumanely raised meat 6. 'Toxic' cooking oil

The Paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle but one of the country's leading dieticians Susie Burrell recently slammed the 'diet' as 'questionable'.

'Every single person is different and we are not saying they should not eat less-refined food and sugar, but to say don't eat grains and all sugar is bad – these blanket statements are the problem,' Burrell said.

But Evans said there has been lots of scientific research proving just how bad refined carbs and sugars are for long-term health and for those who suffer from auto-immune diseases.

'Indeed, in the Western world, we have never been sicker or fatter. The way we have eaten in modern-day society is not working and change is critical.

'I've also met some of the most influential and inspirational people on the planet, whose scientific research around the future of nutrition backs up the potency adopting a Paleo lifestyle can have on your overall health and wellness.' 

The Paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar
