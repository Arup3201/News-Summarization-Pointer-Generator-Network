A farmer spoke of his anger today after having to repeatedly rescue stranded drivers from his estate due to sat nav blunders.

James Cookson has saved an average of one motorist a fortnight from Meldon Park Estate near Morpeth, Northumberland, over the past 18 months. 

Each time, the driver had turned on to a narrow dirt path at the guidance of their sat nav, before getting stuck in the muddy, 'rutted' conditions.

Angry: Farmer James Cookson has saved an average of one motorist a fortnight from Meldon Park Estate, near Morpeth, over the past 18 months. Above, Mr Cookson with a sign warning the lane is 'unsuitable for vehicles'

This is despite a sign at the 3,852-acre estate warning the country lane is 'unsuitable for vehicles'.

Today, Mr Cookson said he was 'frustrated' at having to constantly pull cars, lorries and even fuel tankers from the path via tractor.

'I could understand it if it looked pretty accessible. But the farmers do not use the track with their tractor for the simple reason it is a bit too narrow,' he said.

'It is one of these tracks where you are going to think twice, it is not Tarmaced. It is rutted. It is quite rough.

Muddy: Each time, the driver had turned on to a narrow dirt path at the guidance of their sat nav, before getting stuck in the muddy, 'rutted' conditions. Mr Cookson was forced to rescue the stricken motorists via tractor

Diversion: Most of the drivers are believed to have been travelling from the centre of Morpeth to nearby High Angerton when their sat navs directed them down the path to Mr Cookson's estate

'Surely when you go down there you just think, "This can not be right". How they get down there I do not know.'

Mr Cookson said a number of drivers, believed to have been travelling from the centre of Morpeth to nearby High Angerton had told him their sat navs had directed them down the path.

The lane, which adjoins the B6343 road and has a dead end, was designated a byway open to all traffic (BOAT) around 18 months ago.

Since then, the farmer claims at least one vehicle wrongly turns on to the lane every two weeks, before getting stuck in the ground.

Frsutrated: Today, Mr Cookson said he was 'frustrated' at having to constantly rescue vehicles from the path

Grand: Mr Cookson is the seventh generation of his family to live at the estate after it was bought in 1832 from the Greenwich Hospital Trust. The building features a walled garden which is open to the public and a café

On one recent occasion, a motorist even opened a gate along the path and failed to shut it - allowing horses to escape from a field, he said.

'There is a sign up which clearly says not suitable for motor vehicles, but they do not read that,' said Mr Cookson, who is the seventh generation of his family to live at the estate after it was bought in 1832 from the Greenwich Hospital Trust.

'Either they can not read or they choose not to.'

Path: Mr Cookson said he is considering imposing a £500 charge on anyone who has to be rescued in future

Mr Cookson likened the situation to that at Holy Island, where motorists ignore signs warning them not to cross its causeway outside safe times.

He added that he is considering imposing a £500 charge on anyone who has to be rescued in future.

The estate, featuring a walled garden open to the public and a café, has 15 miles of public rights of way.
