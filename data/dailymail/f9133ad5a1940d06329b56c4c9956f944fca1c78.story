First, Alan Hruby shot his mother.

Tinker Hruby fell to the floor, her 19-year-old son towering over her in their Oklahoma home, waiting for her to die. But she didn't — so he shot the 48-year-old mother-of-two a second time with the 9mm pistol he found in his father's truck.

Then came his sister's turn. Seventeen-year-old Katherine was outside washing her car. When she walked in, Hruby fired once again, killing her immediately.

Hruby waited. Ten minutes, 20, 30 — his mother and sister dead in the Duncan home  — until his dad walked through the front door about an hour later.

He opened fired.

'Ouch,' said John Hruby, 50, feeling the sting of the first bullet enter his body.

Hruby watched his father fall the ground. Then he fired one final time, delivering the killing blow that sealed the tragic fate of his parents and sister.

Those were the grisly final moments of the Oklahoma family that died on Oct. 9 because Hruby needed $3,000 to pay a loan shark — and he thought he would inherit enough money to pay up after killing his parents and sister, court documents obtained by People magazine show.

The college freshman (seen above at his prom) wanted to inherit enough money to pay a $3,000 debt, he told prosecutors

No remorse: It is also said the young man, seen just days before the killing at University of Oklahoma, cried 'crocodile tears' when informed his family was dead

'He felt like if he murdered his mother, his father and his sister, he would be the only one, the only heir, to their estate,' District Attorney Jason Hicks, of Stephens County, told KFOR. 

He at first appeared 'distressed' when police told him about his family's murder on Tuesday, a day after their bodies were found by a housekeeper.

But investigators quickly caught on to the fake tears. 

'The only remorse we’ve seen is because he got caught,' Hicks told KFOR.

'Any tears that he shed, they were crocodile tears,' the prosecutor added. 'It wasn't remorse because "I've lost my mom, my dad and my sister," —  it's remorse because he knows that his life is basically over. 

Prosecutors have described Hruby as a money-obsessed teen who, by his own admission, 'had been cut off financially … due to an abundance of spending in recent times,' People reported.  

The University of Oklahoma freshman has been charged with the sickening murders after he confessed to the killings, prosecutors say.

Hicks describes Hruby as an 'evil' young man who cared little about what he did.

'It was completely planned out,' Hicks said after filing the murder case. 

'This kid is an evil person.'

An eyewitness says that, after the murders, Hruby checked into a room at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas while the University of Oklahoma played the University of Texas in a football match nearby — and it looked as thought nothing had happened.

'I did not travel with him. I just met him in Dallas. He was not acting weird at all,' Andrew Bormann toldThe Oklahoman.

'Nothing that he said or did ever raised any suspicion from me. Every time I saw him on the weekend, he was happy and laughing and having a good time. Even early Monday morning, 1am, he was laughing and joking with me as we were studying.' 

Hruby even posted to Instagram a photo of him with pals in his hotel room on Sunday, the day before his family was discovered and three days after they were killed.

He made a point a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on Thursday night on his social media accounts.

Hruby said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to  pay this person by inheriting money.

His parents had recently cut him off financially, and a search of his dorm room on Wednesday turned up multiple stolen checks. 

Hruby told investigators that after shooting his parents he threw the gun he used, along with a DVD from the home's security system, in a nearby lake.

Appearing in court, Hruby was described as 'soft spoken' and 'unsteady on his feet,' crying when he was denied bail by the judge.

Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty in this case. 

His next court hearing is scheduled for December 17 and he has been told to have a lawyer by December 2. 

Court records also show Duncan police had been investigating Hruby since August because of evidence he had forged checks totaling $17,500.

It is also being reported he assaulted his mother two years ago after a disagreement over money.

In a police affidavit filed in August 2013, officers met with John after he suspected his son was using a credit card not belonging to him.

Authorities say the parents found several charges to the card from Europe, during the time Hruby took a trip to Paris.

He had previously ran afoul of the law earlier this year when he pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card theft.

The credit card he stole belonged to his grandmother, Janice Hruby, according to a family friend.

His father phoned the police and Hruby pleaded guilty in January of this year. He was entered into a delayed sentencing program and was due to appear in court this November.

As part of his punishment, the court ordered him to pay restitution, undergo a substance abuse evaluation, attend drug and alcohol counseling and complete a cognitive behavior program. 

It is also believe he recently stole one of his mother's cards as well, or started one in her name without her knowledge.

The boy liked to document his extravagant lifestyle, posting photos of his trips to Rome, Paris, London and New York City on his Instagram account. He is never with friends or family members on these trips.

 His social media accounts also featured snaps of expensive watches and wallets and cars.

'It's sad. It's very shocking,' said a 21-year-old neighbor, who asked to remain unnamed, about the deaths. 

'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it. Just neighborly things.'

People started getting concerned when John, the publisher of the local newspaper The Marlow Review, did not show up for work on Friday morning.

He also failed to cover the weekly high school football game that he always attends, according to his employees.

Materialistic: Hruby also liked to show off his expensive purchases, sometimes in front of international landmarks for a classy touch, like this pic of an Omega watch in front of the Eiffel Tower

He made a hobby out of posing for photos with expensive cars

'At this time, The Marlow Review asks the general public for prayers following the tragic deaths of John Hruby, our publisher, his wife, Tinker, and their daughter, Katherine,' said John's colleagues in a statement.

'Our staff endeavors to continue to serve Marlow to the best of our ability going forward.'

Meanwhile, friends and classmates of Katherine, 17, a volleyball player, held a vigil for her last night.

'She was such a good person and such good friend to all of us,' said teammate Carly Kirkand.

'She always had a smile on her face even when she had every reason not to. It's going to be hard because she was such a huge part of this team.'
