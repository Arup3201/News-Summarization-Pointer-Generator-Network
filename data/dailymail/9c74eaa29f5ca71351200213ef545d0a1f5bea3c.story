Kevin Pietersen became a freelance cricketer after his severance with England also terminated his current deal with Surrey.

A financial settlement to cover the remaining eight months of his central contract was being drawn up at Lord’s which effectively turned the 33-year-old batsman into a Twenty20 gun for hire.

Centrally-contracted players have deals with counties that run alongside their England terms but they remain fully remunerated by the ECB.

Surrey will negotiate the re-signing of Pietersen on a limited-overs contract within the next fortnight.

What does the future hold? Pietersen is free to play in the IPL, the Twenty20 Blast and the Caribbean PL

Depending on his involvement at the 
IPL – events of the last 36 hours now mean he is available to franchises
 for the entire seventh season – he would be available from late May 
onwards.

'His current 
contract with us will expire as I understand they have found some way of
 resolving his contract,' said Surrey chief executive Richard Gould.

'So we will have to agree terms with him to come and play here, and it will be on a market rate that he comes to us.'

Although other counties may express an interest, Pietersen appears to be settled at the club and lives in nearby Chelsea.

'He’s got a good relationship both with Alec Stewart and with our new coach Graham Ford,' Gould added.

'I
 am sure his phone has been ringing red hot with offers from around the 
world and we may have to see what his motivations and priorities are but
 we would love him to play any form of the game for us.'

In
 addition to entering the IPL auction on February 12-13, Pietersen can 
expect to pick up an ‘icon’ overseas contract with the Caribbean Premier
 League which runs from July 10-August 16.

Although
 not offering the kind of money he might pick up at the IPL – he was on a
 seven-figure deal with Delhi Daredevils last year – a gig in the 
Caribbean would be worth around £75,000 for five weeks’ work plus 
commercial spin-offs.

This may improve Pietersen's mood. On Thursday he was pictured glumly walking around London after posting a forlorn 
message on Twitter that read: 'So sad that this will now be the last time I leave a
 field in an England shirt... Incredibly…' with a link to an Instagram 
picture of him trudging off the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Shane Warne leapt to his friend's 
defence, calling the decision a disgrace: 'I also just heard the sad 
news re KP that he has played his last game for England, to me it's a 
disgrace & a joke ! The ECB is in a shambles'.

And
 his England and Surrey team-mate Chris Tremlett tweeted: 'Sad to see 
what has happened with @KP24.Been a great player for England and a match
 winner. I wish him all the best in the future.'

England
 took the seismic decision to sack their best player on Tuesday as the 
fallout from the worst Ashes tour in their history claimed its most 
high-profile victim.

Paul Downton, the new managing director of Team England made the huge 
call to dismiss Pietersen — the leading runscorer in their history — 
just three days after overseeing the departure of their most successful 
coach Andy Flower.

Downton
 on Tuesday met England captain Alastair Cook and one-day coach Ashley 
Giles in a hotel opposite Lord’s and they reached the ‘unanimous’ 
conclusion that Pietersen, after almost as many controversies as runs, 
is more trouble than he is worth.

Kevin Pietersen has been informed by the England and Wales Cricket Board that he has not been included in the England squads for the forthcoming tour of the Caribbean later this month nor the ICC World Twenty20 to be held in Bangladesh in March.

Kevin Pietersen met with Paul Downton, the Managing Director England Cricket, this week and was told that the unanimous decision of the England management, including the selectors, was that now was the time to start the rebuilding process after England's disappointing winter in Australia.

Paul Downton said: 'Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England as the fact that he is the country's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates.

'However everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy.

'England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill.

'This decision brings some clarity now for the future of the England teams and we all wish Kevin the very best in the rest of his career.'

Kevin Pietersen played 104 Test Matches, 136 One Day internationals and 37 Twenty20 Internationals for England in a career which has spanned from November 2004 to the final Ashes Test match in Sydney in early January.

Kevin Pietersen said: 'Playing cricket for my country has been an honour. Every time I pulled on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever.

'Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years.

'I feel extremely fortunate to have played at a time of great success for England cricket alongside some of the best cricketers the country has ever produced.

'I want to thank everyone for their fantastic support and I wish the team the very best of success going forward.

'I believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer. I will continue to play but deeply regret that it won't be for England.'
