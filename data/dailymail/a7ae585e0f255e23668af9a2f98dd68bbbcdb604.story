Theft: The leather bag belonged to Lucy Watson, pictured, who was distracted at the time by lovelorn suitor Jamie Laing

For once, the young and privileged stars of Made in Chelsea have something more serious to think about than gossip and back stabbing.

In a twist as melodramatic as any of the reality show’s plots, police are investigating the theft of cash from a Prada bag belonging to one of the rich socialites.

Bizarrely, a pink thong was also taken, along with a driving licence.

Police were called in after the theft, which occurred in a supposedly secure area of the set.

In classic whodunnit style, officers now want to speak to cast members to find out if they saw anything  suspicious during the filming of a champagne-soaked Christmas special at a country mansion.

The grey leather bag in question belonged to Lucy Watson, who was distracted at the time of the theft by lovelorn suitor Jamie Laing as he attempted to sweep her off her feet in a horse-drawn carriage.

Most of the show’s stars are said to have been gathered on the steps of Botleys Mansion in Chertsey, Surrey, for the grand gesture at the time of the theft.

Programme maker Channel 4 is investigating the incident on the show, which follows a group of wealthy friends.

In scenes filmed days earlier in London’s Chelsea, Miss Watson had a spat with designer Victoria Baker-Harber in which they called each other ‘prostitutes’.

The row continued at the country house, with Miss Baker-Harber, 25, launching a foul-mouthed tirade at Miss Watson, 22.

Awkward silence fell – until Miss Watson was called away to meet Mr Laing, the 25-year-old heir to the McVitie’s biscuit fortune.

Hooray: The rest of the cast applauded as the two were led away after a string of insults were traded

Feast: The whole team had a Christmas banquet but the episode ended with a handbag being stolen

A friend of Miss Watson said she noticed things missing soon afterwards as her bag’s zip was left open.

The source said: ‘Lucy was furious. For her money and her driving licence to go missing was bad enough, but she felt absolutely violated that her thong was taken as well.

‘She doesn’t know who stole the items, but she reported it to the police the next day. It’s a closed set so obviously there are not going to be many people about other than cast and crew. If you told me this had happened on The Only Way is Essex I would have believed it more than Made in Chelsea.’

It is thought police will speak to Miss Baker-Harber and her friend Sophie Hermann, who did not join the cast for the carriage scene.

Grinch: Victoria Baker-Harber laid into co-star Cheska Hull at dinner, calling her a f***ing fat turkey

Angry: Cheska, left, sat dumbfounded while she was insulted at the Christmas dinner - but the episode's filming ended with a worse outcome than just gossip after Lucy Watson's handbag, cash and thong were stolen

Meanwhile, it appears Mr Laing’s 
last-ditch attempt to win Miss Watson over has failed. She split with 
him shortly after filming the show, broadcast on Monday.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘The Made In Chelsea production team take on-set security seriously.’

A Surrey police spokesman said: ‘We are investigating an allegation of theft at an address off Stonehill Road in Chertsey.’
