Shot: Derrick Moye was shot chasing down a thief who stole his girlfriend's purse, he is expected to survive the attack

A second person in as many weeks has been shot by purse snatching
thieves in Philadelphia.

Derrick Moye, 24, was shot in the chest Friday while chasing down a thief who
stole his 23-year-old girlfriend’s purse as they left his North Philadelphia
apartment just before midnight. Two suspects are in custody, he is expected to
survive.

A 26-year-old woman was shot to death while walking with her
mother last week when she struggled with a thief trying to snatch her purse,
police have yet to link the two incidents.

Rasheed Hall, 26, and Clinton Brown, 20, were arrested shortly
after the latest incident in which police said Mr Moye was shot trying to
retrieve his girlfriend’s purse while running after Mr Brown.

The girlfriend, who has not been identified, told Fox 29 about the
terrifying encounter.

‘He just grabbed it and took my
money out and dropped my bag,’ she said,
adding the thief made off with $300.

Mr Hall then jumped out from behind a building about a block away
and shot Mr Moye as he gave chase, police said.

‘He shot him, jumped out of nowhere,’
she recalled adding ‘I was thinking about death. I was shocked, I didn't know
what to do.’

The scene: Police say the heroic boyfriend was shot by Rasheed Hall after Clinton Brown stole the purse

Searching for clues: Investigators picked the scene for clues well into the early morning, cops snagged the two suspects 30 minutes after shooting only a few blocks away

Police found the two men, along with a third person, nearby about
30 minutes later, according to reports.

Both suspects were charged with aggravated assault, robbery, theft
and other charges, records showed.

Investigators are now looking into whether the incident is related
to a shooting last week that killed Amber Long.

Ms Long was walking through the Northern Liberties neighborhood with
her mother when two thieves accosted them, one stealing the mother’s purse and
another trying to take hers.

The young woman was shot dead while trying to fight the mugger
off, police have yet to find any suspects.

‘On the surface, they
look very similar,’ police lieutenant George McClay told Fox 29.’Could we get
lucky? I hope so. That was a terrible crime. I'm hoping we can correlate the
crimes together, but we're nowhere close to that yet.’

Attempts by MailOnline to reach a police spokesperson were not successful.

Mr Moye appears to have been more
fortunate than Ms Long, authorities say he is improving and expected to make a
full recovery.

‘He came to my rescue,’ said his
girlfriend. ‘I'm real grateful for that.’
