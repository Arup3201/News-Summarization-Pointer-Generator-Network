So many journalists are camped outside Michael Schumacher's house on the shores of Lake Geneva that Swiss police have been forced to move in and shield the property.

There has been a media scrum outside the home in Gland, with one Russian TV crew reportedly trying to broadcast live from outside the house.

Mr Schumacher is recovering there from severe head injuries following a skiing accident in December in Meribel, France.

The family has its own private security teams who patrol the house 24-hours a day, but the police intervened when some journalists strayed on to the grounds in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the former Formula One ace.

A Russian TV crew trying to broadcast live from the scene were told to move on, German newspaper Bild said.

'The police have told some journalists who were on the private property of Michael Schumacher to move in the public domain,' a spokesman for the Vaud police, Pierre-Olivier Gaudard, told reporters, according to the Telegraph.

In June this year Schumacher was moved from a hospital in Grenoble, where he had been cared for since the end of December following the accident, to the University Hospital in Lausanne.

After eight weeks at the Lausanne facility, it was decided Schumacher would make the short 25-mile journey back to his house at Gland.

Seven-times Formula One world champion Schumacher has not been home for almost nine months since embarking on a skiing holiday with his family in the French resort of Meribel.

It was there the accident took place, with Schumacher hitting his head on a rock in a fall that resulted in him being placed in a medically-induced coma for a number of months due to the nature of his head injuries.

Although Schumacher finally emerged from the coma in mid-June, so allowing him to be transferred to Lausanne, progress remains slow, albeit sufficient enough for him to head home.

A statement from Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, read: 'Michael's rehabilitation will continue from now on from home.

'Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months.

'There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead.

'We would like to extend our gratitude to the entire team at CHUV Lausanne for their thorough and competent work.

'We ask the privacy of Michael's family continue to be respected, and that speculation about his state of health is avoided.'
