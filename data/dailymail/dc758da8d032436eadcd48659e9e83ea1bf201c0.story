A dying mother was forced to wait almost six months before seeing a cancer specialist - when a surgeon downgraded her case because she was aged under 35, a court heard today.

Katie Maytum, now 35, of Maesteg, South Wales, is suing the Welsh NHS for £750,000, claiming surgeons ignored official cancer guidelines - robbing her of seeing her children grow up.

The mother-of-two, who has terminal breast cancer, told the High Court in Cardiff that she was forced to wait five and half months before being seen by a specialist because of her age.

Three breast cancer surgeons at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, went against national guidelines of treating all lumps in women over 30 as urgent, the hearing was told.

Miss Maytum was aged 31 when she went to her local GP after noticing a lump in her left breast. She told the court today: ‘I couldn’t but think that there was cancer inside my body.

‘I know the feeling of a cyst and this was a hard lump which got bigger. It started off as a lump the size of a pea and continued through my menstrual cycle and continued afterwards.

‘I went to my GP as I was concerned with my family history - my grandmother and great aunts all had breast cancer.’

Her GP was so worried he faxed an ‘urgent referral’ form to the South West Wales Cancer Network - which brings together groups involved in planning, commissioning and provision of cancer care.

But when surgeon Vummiti Murali-Krishnan received the referral form he downgraded her to ‘routine’ and classed the case as not one of ‘urgent suspected cancer’ - because she was under 35.

Government guidelines state any woman aged 30 or older with a discrete lump which has persisted after her period should receive an urgent referral and be seen by a specialist within two weeks.

In Wales this means Miss Maytum should have seen a specialist and had surgery to remove the tumour within two months.

But because she had been downgraded to a routine referral she had to wait five and a half months to see a specialist, with the tumour growing in her breast and spreading through her body.

An ultrasound scan performed on the day she finally saw the specialist confirmed her fears that she had cancer.

She underwent surgery and lengthy chemotherapy and was cancer for free for several years until a lump appeared in her neck in April this year and she was told by doctors she had only 18 months to live.

Miss Maytum told the hearing: ‘Standing or sitting for long periods of time is uncomfortable because of the cancer in my pelvis, spine and lower back.

‘It’s hard cleaning the house or lifting my youngest son. I receive a lot of help from my partner and mother-in law - they help with the children and cleaning.’

Nigel Poole QC, representing Miss Maytum, told the hearing that medical experts were in ‘broad agreement’ that a woman of her age would have had a 90 per cent chance of surviving more than 10 years with urgent treatment.

He said: ‘That is what oncologists would regard as being cured. In the five and half month wait for treatment her chances of survival fell to between 70 and 80 per cent.’

Miss Maytum is due to marry her partner next month and her children Megan, 14, and Zac, 10, will be by her side at the service.

The mother, who was training to be a nurse when she was diagnosed as terminal, has been given 18 months to live.

Miss Maytum is suing the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board claiming Mr Murali-Krishnan was negligent in downgrading her case to routine.

Miss Maytum’s damages claim includes the ‘loss of unquantifiable services of a wife and mother’.

These include £7,500 a year from April 2017 to April 2027, when her son Zac will be 21, to cover the cost of a nanny for 20 hours a week at £6.93 an hour.

Mr Murali-Krishnan denies the accusation of negligence and said it was ‘reasonable’ to downgrade her case with the information he was given.

He said because of the aggressive form of cancer Miss Maytum suffers from, the delay in her treatment has made no difference to her eventual terminal illness.

He admits negligence in failing to tell her GP about the downgrading of her case and in not arranging for her case to be reviewed within three months.

The court hearing was told Mr Murali-Krishnan and two other surgeons at the hospital have now changed their policy to meet national guidelines.

It also heard that Miss Maytum would have been seen within two weeks if she had lived in England rather than in Wales.

Mr Poole told Mr Murali-Krishnan: ‘A woman of Miss Maytum’s age with a discrete breast lump which had persisted for six weeks, referred on an urgent basis by her GP - certainly in England, that woman would expect to be seen in two weeks.

‘But at your hospital it was five-and-a-half months and you were happy for her to wait this long with a lump in her breast.’

Mr Murali-Krishnan said: ‘This is a hospital policy which I have to follow.’

The surgeon told the hearing he ‘definitely’ would have changed the referral back to urgent if he had received a letter or telephone call from the GP who initially referred her saying how concerned he was.

But the hearing has been told Miss Maytum’s GP was never made aware his patient had been downgraded against all national guidelines. The hearing continues.
