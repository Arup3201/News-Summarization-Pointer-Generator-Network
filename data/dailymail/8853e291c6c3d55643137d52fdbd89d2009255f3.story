A 10-year-old girl has died days after she was gang raped by four teenagers in Mumbai, police said today.

The girl is said to have been lured to a secluded area in Hanuman Nagar after her alleged attackers - who are aged between 13 and 16 and two of whom are brothers - promised to give her Rs10 if she did a chore for them.

Officials in Turbhe said the young girl knew all four of her alleged attackers, and that one had raped her on a previous occasion.

'Gang rape': The 10-year-old girl died yesterday at the DY Patil Hospital in Nerul, Mumbai, after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers on June 16

Savage attack: The girl's alleged attackers are said to have lured the 10-year-old to a remote arae of Hanuman Nagar where she was 'raped repeatedly'

The victim is believed to have been rushed to a hospital in Vashi after she developed a high fever four days after the attack on June 16 in Hanuman Nagar.

When her condition worsened she was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at the DY Patil Hospital in Nerul, where she died yesterday, the Mumbai Mirror reported.

According to the report local police said the girl had described her ordeal to one of her friends, who then informed her parents on Monday.

An officer based at the Turbhe police station told ndtv.com: 'All the accused knew each other as well as the victim. They raped her repeatedly.

'She was rushed to the hospital after her parents got to know of her plight but she lost her life on Tuesday,' he said.

All four accused have been arrested, the report said.

A string of brutal sex attacks in India have made headlines in recent months, including the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old student on a bus last December.

The woman died of her injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks after the assault, which enraged the Indian population.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets in the days after the attack to voice their anger at the prevalence of crimes against women in India.

Crisis: Women poured onto the streets in Barasat earlier this month in protest over the gang rape and murder of a 20-year-old student

Earlier this month a 21-year-old Irish tourist was allegedly drugged and raped while in Kolkata volunteering with an aid agency.

Just
one day later, police said a 30-year-old American woman was gang raped 
by three men while hitch-hiking back to a guest house in the northern 
Indian resort of Manali.

Also
this month women and students poured onto the streets in Barasat in 
protest over the gang-rape and murder of a 20-year-old college student.

In March six men appeared in court in India accused of raping a Swiss tourist and beating her husband with sticks while the couple were on a cycling holiday in Madhya Pradesh.

Five of the men, who were all said to be local farmers, were photographed with their faces hidden by black hoods and escorted by Madhya Pradesh police officers after they were charged with gang rape.
