When Amy Winehouse transformed the musical landscape with her classic albums Frank and Back To Black, a wave of talented homegrown divas emerged in her wake, with Adele, Duffy and Paloma Faith all becoming major stars.

But her influence stretched beyond these shores, as Dutch singer Caro Emerald acknowledges.

The 31-year-old from Amsterdam, with a Rubenesque figure and voice straight out of the Forties, is gaining a substantial following in this country, thanks to appearances on Strictly Come Dancing, Jools Holland and Children In Need.

Forties chic: New fans for 'The Shocking Miss Caro Emerald'

Last month, she sold out the Royal Albert Hall, and new dates have been added to her autumn tour.

And a lot of the credit, she admits, should go to Amy. ‘She was my big inspiration,’ Caro says. ‘When she came along, there wasn’t much jazz or swing in the charts. But Amy sexed up the whole genre.

‘I discovered her while studying jazz at the Amsterdam Conservatory. I loved the old-school singers but also R&B, hip-hop and soul.’

Winehouse’s lead has given Caro impressive staying power, too. Her million-selling debut, Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor, this week returned to the UK Top 20, two years after its first chart run.

Talent: Caro Emerald bombed out in an audition for Dutch TV talent show  ¿Idol¿ and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was discovered singing backup

But, as Caro explains, her recording 
career began by accident. A struggling session singer in the Dutch 
capital, she bombed out in an audition for Dutch TV talent show  ‘Idol’ 
and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was invited to sing
 on a demo tape by Canadian songwriter Vince Degiorgio and two local 
producers.

Inspiration: Late singer Amy Winehouse

The song she performed, Back It Up, 
was going to be offered to other artists, but  her stunning vocals 
changed all that. It became her  first single and launched a partnership
 with her team that is still intact.

If
 Emerald’s music is built around Forties big-band flourishes and 
smouldering vocals, her image is also a quirky mix of old and new.

Her voluptuous curves are draped in chic vintage clothes on her new album sleeve; sexy but strangely demure.

‘You can be sexy without throwing everything on the table,’ she insists.

‘I wouldn’t have wanted to live in the Forties, though. As a woman, I wouldn’t have the same rights as now. I’m a liberal Amsterdam girl, so I wouldn’t have been happy, but it’s nice to be nostalgic about the past.’

Caro’s new album pushes her music beyond the Hollywood theme of her debut.

With its dramatic string sections recorded at Abbey Road, it harks back to the romance of Twenties Paris, with Black Valentine also nodding to Portishead.

A stylish sequel, it should further enhance the status of a singer who was once dubbed the ‘Dutch Adele’.

‘Any comparison with Adele is a compliment, though I think my voice is different’ Caro tells me. ‘I’d love to have a beer with her one day.’

The Shocking Miss Emerald is out on May 6 on Dramatico. Caro Emerald’s UK tour starts on September 6 at Sheffield City Hall (gigsandtours.com)
