Dolls of slave characters from Quentin Tarantino's new blockbuster have caused outrage amongst civil rights activists who say they should be withdrawn from sale.

The figurines represent characters from the ultra-violent film Django Unchained, which tells the story of a former slave who travels across America to find his wife and free her from slavery at the hands of a cruel plantation owner.

Amazon.com was selling three, eight-inch tall plastic dolls representing the black slaves Django, Broomhilda and Stephen as part of a series of figures from the film.

No longer for sale: The series of six action figures from the film are now unavailable from Amazon.com

But black community leaders in America, who are planning to picket the Golden Globe awards this Sunday, have called for them to be withdrawn from sale saying they 'trivialise the horrors of slavery'.

Najee Ali, director of the Los Angeles civil rights group Project Islamic Hope, said he and other figures in the black community were 'outraged' to hear of the action figures and said they were 'a slap in the face of our ancestors'.

Calling for a boycott of the products, which are no longer available on Amazon.com, he added: 'We feel that it trivializes the horrors of slavery and what African Americans experienced.

'Tarantino and Weinstein didn't have action figures for their movie Inglorious Basterds because they know the Jewish community would never allow it, and the African-American community shouldn't allow anyone to disrespect our ancestors.'

Mr Ali told Mail Online this afternoon: 'We are organising a major protest and rally outside the Golden Globes Award ceremony to draw attention to the injustice and disrespect to our African ancestors.'

He said he would be supported in this by the National Action Network, the New York-based civil rights organisation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several churches and other community groups.

National Action Network's president in Los Angeles, the Reverend KW Tulloss said: 'Selling this doll is highly offensive to our ancestors and the African American community.'

The three slave dolls are part of a series of several featuring characters from the film.  The slave dolls show Django, the freed slave played by Jamie Foxx, Broomhilda, his wife, played by Kerry Washington, and Stephen, another slave, played by Samuel L Jackson.

The remaining, white, dolls include plantation owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo di Caprio, a bounty hunter called Schultz (Christoph Waltz), and Butch (James Remar).

They were produced by National Entertainment Collectibles Assocation (NECA) in collaboration with the Weinstein Company, the studio that produced Django Unchained.

When the figures were announced, NECA Joel Weinshanker said the company was 'very excited to bring the stellar cast of Django to life and honoured to be working with another Tarantino masterpiece', according to the Daily Beast.

In the company's defence, the figurines are said to be intended not as toys but as collectibles for adults rather than children.

But reviewers on Amazon.com, where the dolls are no longer available to buy, have other ideas.

One wrote: 'Why? Really this is some racist s***! The movie was good, but this is inexcusable.  Do the accessories include whips, chains and klan members?'

Another said: 'I am in complete shock that someone would exploit the struggle of my ancestors and the entire freedom movement with such tasteless, classless, and disgusting "action figures".

'Shame on Amazon for even selling these.'

The film has already attracted criticism for its subject matter and its liberal use of the word n*****, which is said more than 100 times.

Director Spike Lee took to Twitter to express his outrage at what he perceived as offensive sujbject matter, saying: 'American Slavery Was Not A Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western.

'It Was A Holocaust. My Ancestors Are Slaves. Stolen From Africa. I Will Honor Them.' [sic]

Django Unchained opened in the US on Christmas Day after its LA premiere was cancelled due to the Sandy Hook school massacre.  It is due to open in the UK on January 18.

The Weinstein Company and Amazon.com are yet to comment.
