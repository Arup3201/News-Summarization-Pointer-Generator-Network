The undertaker who handles the bodies of the executed on Indonesia's 'Death Island' has shared what the final moments are like for families before their loved ones are shot and shed light on what Myuran Sukuraman and Andrew Chan could be eating as their last meal.

Suhendro Putro, 62, has been a funeral director since 1992 and cleaned the bodies of the last group of convicted drug smugglers who were put to death in January.

He told Daily Mail Australia families and undertakers were placed together in an open area, which was paved with bitumen about 1km away from where the prisoners were executed.

Putro said the families are close enough to hear the screams of the executed

Mr Putro said five officers on the execution squad shot at the same time as they killed each inmate.

'Five people shot at the same time so the sound was so loud. There was just one bang and one of them had a real bullet,' he said.

'The family started crying and screaming when this happened. It was just a shock to me.'

It is unclear whether or not the families of Myuran Sukuraman and Andrew Chan would be on Nusakambangan - in Central Java in Indonesia - when the Bali Nine duo meet their fate.

Mr Putro said fellow inmates would cook the final meals of those on death row.

He said the last time he was on the island for January's round of executions he, his team and officers on duty were fed Nasi Padang - a rice dish native to West Sumatra in Indonesia.

Meanwhile, family members gathered at the jail ate KFC for dinner before the executions took place just after midnight on January 18. 

Then Mr Putro would wait a hour and a half to two hours for the medical examiner to remove the bullets before cleaning the bodies.

He then dressed the Christian men in white formal suits with gloves, the Muslim men in traditional funeral dress or whatever the family had requested of him.

It comes after Indonesian Authorities have announced the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran has been delayed by up to one month. 

Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers 'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons. 

Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island.  

Indonesian authorities had already confirmed that Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, would be among the next group of death row prisoners to be executed, despite repeated appeals from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for their lives to be spared.
