Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini has hit out at the ban Luis Suarez received for biting him.

Suarez was banned from all football activity for four months by FIFA on Thursday as well as nine Uruguay matches.

The Liverpool striker caused the third biting storm of his career when he attacked Chiellini in the 80th minute of Uruguay's 1-0 win on Tuesday.

But with Italy now out of the tournament, Chiellini believes the punishment was overly harsh, saying he feels no malice towards the Liverpool striker.

'Now inside me there's no feelings of joy, revenge or anger against Suarez for an incident that happened on the pitch and that's done,' he posted on his official website.

'There only remains the anger and the disappointment about the match.

'At the moment my only thought is for Luis and his family, because they will face a very difficult period.

'I have always considered unequivocal the disciplinary interventions by the competent bodies, but at the same time I believe that the proposed formula is excessive.

'I sincerely hope that he will be allowed, at least, to stay close to his team mates during the games because such a ban is really alienating for a player.'

Suarez will not be able to play for Liverpool until November due to his ban and is not even allowed to train with his team-mates.

Uruguay, whose FA have confirmed they will appeal the ban, must face Colombia in Saturday's last 16 clash without their star man.
