Natalie Eckert, the 37-year-old mum of five from Stoke-on-Trent, who is aiming to become the first person to complete a marathon wearing high heels says she will complete it in under five hours.

In fact, the five-inch heels she intends to run in will be a walk in the park compared to the seven-inch shoes she wears in every day life. 

In navigating the 26.2-mile course, Eckert hopes to set a Guinness World Record for her daughter and raise money for a good cause.

Every inch counts: Natalie Eckert is hoping to run the 2015 London Marathon in high heels

Well heeled: Natalie has been wearing five-inch high heels while preparing for the marathon

Natalie came up with the idea after her daughter found an entry in the record books about German Julia Plecher, who ran 100 metres (nearly 330ft) in 14.531 seconds in a pair of high heels.

She said: ‘My daughter suggested that I was little bit more hard-core and should do a marathon in high heels.

‘I’ve been running for about 12 years for pleasure but with regards to training for this I’ve been running about two months since I applied to Guinness and I’ve been running in five-inch heels.’

Tough slog: The 37-year-old mum was inspired by a German woman who ran 100 metres in heels

She added: ‘It’s not been too difficult running in heels. I’m used to wearing seven-inch heels for 12 hours a day every day, so five inches is actually quite a nice break for my feet.’

Natalie hopes to raise £5,000 for Asthma UK and a charity for bereaved children called Winston's Wish and although she has never run a marathon before she is confident she’ll be able to complete the race in under five hours.

She once ran a half marathon in two hours and 17 minutes.

She said: ‘If I wasn’t running in heels I’d be looking at under four hours. I think five hours is a reachable target, but it’s also going to be quite a challenge to do it in heels.’
