An education: Lawrence W. Becker, who was headmaster at the Brooks School for more than 20 years, allegedly had an affair with one of his students in 2004

A former New England prep school head allegedly engaged in an improper relationship with a student while serving as headmaster; the alleged relationship may have in turn been revealed by an escort.

An unnamed New York escort’s ‘disturbing emails’ to the Brooks School outside of Boston apparently sparked the initial investigation into Lawrence W. Becker, who was the headmaster of the prestigious prepatory school for more than two decades.

Becker, 71, allegedly hired the male escort in the fall of 2011.

According to the New York Post’s Page Six, the male escort sent a series of ‘disturbing’ emails to the Brooks School last summer.

The Boston Globe reports that while Becker initially denied knowing the man sending threatening emails, he eventually admitted to knowing him.

John R. Packard, the current head of the school, as well as William N. Booth, the current board president, sent a letter to the community late last week alerting alumni and parents that Becker’s conduct was ‘an abuse of his position.’

The two men asked in the letter if anyone had ‘personal knowledge that calls into question Mr Becker’s conduct.’

Prestigious: The Brooks School, located in North Andover, Massachusetts, was founded in 1926 and charges $49,365 for tuition with boarding

It was alleged that he engaged in ‘inappropriate sexual behavior’ with a student in 2004 while travelling on school business. School officials also learned that he hired a male escort at that time, the Globe reported. 

Karen Schwartzman, a public relations consultant for the school, told the Globe that the student in question, who had graduated from Brooks, had resolved the case.

A representative for the school did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for additional comment on the matter.

Becker served as headmaster at the North Andover, Massachusetts college preparatory school from 1986 to 2008.

The still-married man, who currently splits his time between Florida and Cape Cod said in a statement: ‘The communication to alumni, parents, and friends from the school, which I loved and to which I devoted for 22 years causes me and my wife great pain, sadness, and embarrassment.’

The Brooks School, which was founded in 1926, charges $49,365 for tuition, including boarding costs.

According to its website, 369 students are currently enrolled, with 68 percent of the class boarding.
