It was once the symbol of Gaddafi's strength over the west, a brutal image of power and victory.

Now it stands ruined with the Mad Dog's illusion of power over the country shattered, like the windows in his once regal compound.

Built in 1986, after the US air strikes in Libya, the iconic statue shows a fist crushing an American aircraft and was the majestic backdrop for many of the dictator's speeches.

In a final gesture of contempt rebels forces climbed and painted the statue screaming victory as their dictator remains absent, presumably in hiding.

Ransacked: Gaddafi's Bab Al Azaziya compound in Tripoli is trashed - the dictator's whereabouts is still unknown

Triumphant: Gaddafi used the gold fist statue as a backdrop to many speeches

RAF warplanes blasted missile launchers and a command bunker in Colonel Gaddafi’s home town of Sirte yesterday as rebel forces prepared to launch an attack.

SAS men with Arab special forces were said to be carrying out reconnaissance for Nato and rebels around the Gaddafi stronghold for what  Libyan officials say could be the ‘last great battle’ of the war.

Reports have claimed that the dictator and some of his sons are in the town together with thousands of his troops and clan fighters whose loyalty Gaddafi bought when he created Sirte as effectively his second capital.

For the second day running, RAF Tornado 
GR4s attacked targets in and around the coastal town, 250 miles east of 
Tripoli, as Nato once again ‘softened’ regime defences before a rebel 
offensive.

The Tornados took off from RAF Marham in Norfolk on a long-range strike 
mission firing a salvo of Storm Shadow precision-guided missiles against
 a large command and control bunker.

It followed strikes by Tornados the previous day on three mobile missile
 launchers for Scud missiles. Regime commanders are said to have kept 
back an arsenal of 240 Scuds which would be capable of carrying chemical
 weapons such as mustard gas.

Rebels point to reports that more than 100
 of their captured fighters and supporters have been executed in Sirte 
and this has fuelled their determination to storm it.

Despite continued fighting in Tripoli – RAF Tornados and Typhoons again 
attacked targets to the south of the city and regime fighters launched a
 counter attack near the main airport – Sirte was poised to become the 
new front line with thousands of rebel fighters, tanks, artillery and 
rocket launchers moving to holding positions near the town of  Ras 
Lanuf.

The importance of that military operation was illustrated by Nato 
carrying out 29 strikes on mobile missile launchers around the town as 
rebels blitzed advancing forces with volleys of Grad missiles.

With Nato effectively ‘closing the ring’ around Sirte’s 100,000 
population, Defence Secretary Liam Fox said: ‘We have information that 
there are some elements of the regime in Sirte. Where they are still 
continuing to wage war on the people of Libya, we will continue to 
degrade their military capabilities.

‘The regime needs to recognise that the game is up. It is all over and 
they need to stop attacking their own people … but as long as they do 
continue to attack the people, Nato will continue to attack.’

Yesterday rebel forces appeared to have been stalled by strong 
resistance some 60 miles from Sirte while the defences of the town are 
finalised under the direction of one of Gaddafi’s sons. The rebel 
leadership, apparently trying to avoid repeating the bloodshed of the 
battle for Tripoli, are working behind the scenes to secure the peaceful
 surrender of Sirte but are said to believe this is a ‘distant hope’.

Virtually untouched until recently by the civil war, Sirte is of both 
symbolic and strategic importance – it stands on the main highway 
between Tripoli and the rebel headquarters of Benghazi – and is 
Gaddafi’s strongest remaining garrison town. Gaddafi ploughed huge sums 
of money into Sirte, arming the local tribes and effectively buying 
their loyalty months ago. Rebel fighters would face a difficult task to 
take it without massive help from Nato airstrikes.

Gaddafi has closely cultivated Sirte and its tribal leaders. After 
Tripoli, it was his showpiece, where he would pitch one of his Bedouin 
tents and entertain foreign dignitaries.

Amnesty International claimed yesterday it had uncovered evidence that 
forces loyal to Gaddafi massacred detainees at two military camps in 
Tripoli this week as rebels seized control of the city.

Detainees from a military camp in Khilit al-Ferjan described how, on 
Tuesday evening, 160 of them fled a metal hangar after two guards told 
them the gates were unlocked.

As they barged through the gates, two other guards opened fire and threw  hand grenades. Only two dozen managed to escape.

The second wave of killings is said to have happened on Wednesday at the
 Qasr Ben Ghashir military camp, when guards shot five detainees.As the 
search for the absent dictator continued, British Tornado jets pounded 
bunkers in Sirte overnight.
