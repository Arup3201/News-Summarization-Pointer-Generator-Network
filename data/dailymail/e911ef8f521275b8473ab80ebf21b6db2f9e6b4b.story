A firefighter was left battling to save his leg after an off-duty rescue saw him contract a vicious flesh-eating bacterial infection.

Ian Buckley, from Augusta, Georgia, was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis following a dramatic rescue in which he leapt into the Savannah River to save a woman and her four-year-old-son.

While hiking with friends at Sa­vannah Bluff Heritage Pre­serve Mr Buckley saw the mother and young boy stranded in a sunken kayak about 400 yards from the shore.

He waded out the free the kayak and bring the woman and her son back to safety, but as he battled the rapids Mr Buckley cut his leg on  rocks below the water.

Ian Buckley from Augusta needed six operations to save his life and prevent him from losing leg

'She was just stuck. She needed help,' he told WRDW. 'Going across the rapids like that, it's slippery. You take a beating. I got knocked over a few times.

'All it did was scrape my shin, but I could feel the bruise. I knew I'd hit it pretty hard,' he added.

Mr Buckley woke up the next morning feeling stiff, and when he began suffering flu-like symptoms he recognized the signs of infection. 

He elevated his leg and eventually went to his doctor, who put him on antibiotics, but the infection continued to worsen.

Then, less than a week after the kayak incident, Mr Buckley felt a swelling behind his knee and went to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center at Doctors Hos­pital and saw Dr Fred Mullins, the center's medical director.

Mr Buckley told The Augusta Chronicle: 'When Dr. Mullins saw it, I think he knew what it was straight away.'

'He said, 'I'll stop cutting when I run out of infection.' The first time I saw them unwrap it, I had an incision from just below my right knee to just above my ankle.'

Mr Buckley spent spent eight days in the Intensive Care Unit during which time he was operated on four times.

Now much of the tissue in his right shin is gone and walks around with a vacuum pack sealed tightly around his leg to keep the wound clean.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection that spreads quickly and aggressively causing  tissue death at the infection site and beyond. It can be fatal if not treated promptly and often results in amputations.

The bacteria can make its way into the body through an insect bite or minor cut or abrasion. Bit although it can start with just a slight scratch, the infection spreads very quickly.

Mr Buckley stands next to the Savannah River in Augusta where he rescued a mother and child from their sunken kayak and at the same time contracted a vicious flesh-eating bacterial infection

'As it penetrates deeper, it gets in to the fascia, the covering of the muscle,' Dr Mullins explained. 'The fascia doesn't have a good blood supply to kill the bacteria.' 

It's very uncommon. He said the burn center treats four or five cases per month in patients from across the region, and very few locally.

Its most likely to occur in someone whose immune systems are already compromised, such as diabetics, cancer patients and people who have immunosuppresion conditions.

'But it can occur in people with good immune systems,' Dr Mullins added. 'Most people will scratch themselves and won't get it, but there are those certain cases,'

He advised not dismissing any cut or a scratch as insignificant. 'If it starts looking funny, it needs to be seen,' he said. 

Mr Buckley has just had his sixth operation and said he will be out of work for at least six weeks. He said the incident will not keep him out of the river, but he will keep antibacterial wipes handy.

'It's like crossing the road and watching out for the car,' he said. 'I'm not going to stay out of the river, but I don't want to repeat it, either.'
