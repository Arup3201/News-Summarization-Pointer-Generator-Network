Media mogul and multimillionaire Simon Cowell was today condemned as 'irresponsible and stupid' by the UK government after telling students not to bother with an education and just 'get lucky'.

Mr Cowell, who is worth more than £200 million from his record labels and talent shows like the X Factor, said he was 'useless' at school but it did not matter.

But his remarks have been heavily criticised by Education Secretary Michael Gove, who told MailOnline the media tycoon should promote hard work at school 'not rubbish it'.

'Useless': Simon Cowell (pictured here with girlfriend Lauren Silverman) said he didn't work hard at school

Speaking to US radio station z100, Mr Cowell
said he did not work at school but upped his game when he left.

Being in the right place at the right time was often the key to 
success, he claimed.

He said: 'I didn't work hard when I was at school. I left at 16 and I didn't have any qualifications.

'I was useless. The secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky.'

But at a time when young people are being accused of lacking ambition, the X Factor boss became embroiled in a row with government ministers for failing to encourage the need to get good qualifications

Mr Gove, the Education Secretary, told MailOnline: 'This is an irresponsible and stupid thing to say.

'Teachers strive every day to ensure children understand the importance of learning, hard work and discipline. Simon Cowell’s comments undermine their efforts. 

'The truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky.  For everybody else, it’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school.

'Celebrities like Mr Cowell should encourage education, not rubbish it.'

However, a spokesman for Mr Cowell later insisted: 'This was quite clearly a joke made in a humorous radio interview and has been taken completely out of context.'

Mr Cowell attended the private Dover College and then went on to Windsor Technical College.

The 54-year-old, who is expecting his first child with girlfriend Lauren Silverman, said he made a lot of mistakes when he was first starting out and even had to move back to his parent's home.

But he says he has learned from his failures and it has made him a better businessman.

'You make a ton of mistakes in the beginning and just hope you learn from them.'

But politicians lined up to say education is important and slammed programmes like the X Factor for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily.

Criticism: Education Secretary Michael Gove condemned Simon Cowell's remarks as 'irresponsible and stupid'

The culture of finding fame fast 
promoted by Mr Cowell has been linked to a reluctance among some young 
people to commit themselves to achieving more at school.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of 
the influential education select committee, said: ‘For every Simon 
Cowell and brilliant entrepreneur like Richard Branson who leave school 
without qualifications, there are hundreds or thousands of young people 
who are not achieving good English and Maths GSCEs who are condemning 
themselves to a life of low aspirations and low wages.

‘X
Factor has already sent the wrong message to many young people that it 
is all too easy to get rich quick on the back of  couple of hours’ worth
of performance.

‘The 
reality of life is that careers take years of graft and that includes 
having a strong education, particularly for those from deprived 
backgrounds.’

Success: The X Factor brand turned Mr Cowell into a global success with shows being made in America and the UK

Earlier this month a study claimed companies choose to hire foreign 
workers because young Brits have been taught by shows 
like X Factor that they can start in high paid roles just because they 
‘want it’.

Migrants
work harder and are better qualified for many jobs than those born in 
the UK, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research found.

By
comparison, many young people in Britain leave school without good 
maths grades but think they are ‘too good’ for manual work because 
reality TV talent contests have made them think they can be bypass hard graft.

One respondent told the NIESR: 
'We
have a generation coming through who look very much at, we are going to
start at the top, it’s that X Factor, we can be famous in five 
minutes.'

From mail room to media mogul: Simon Cowell says a bit of luck got him to where he is today

After leaving school, Mr Cowell took up a few menial jobs before his father got him a job in the mail room at his record label - EMI.

His real rise to fame came in 2004, when he created the X Factor using his production company SyCo.

The runaway success of the series propelled him into the spotlight and made him a household name.

X Factor branched out to America in 2011 and there are now editions of the show worldwide.

Following on from the global triumphs of X Factor, Mr Cowell launched America's Got Talent in 2006 and a year later he appeared as a judge on Britain's Got Talent for the launch series with fellow stars Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan.

Ratings may well have taken a tumble over recent years, but Simon Cowell is understood to have negotiated a new £150 million deal that will see The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent run until 2016.
