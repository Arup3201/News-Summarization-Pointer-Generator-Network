The Duchess of Cambridge coxed a poorly young girl into a Christmas sing-a-long today - with the help of a toy frog.

Kate, 31, found herself resorting to the puppet to charm some of the children at Shooting Star House Children's Hospice in Hampton, Middlesex.

Even then, some were not so impressed. When one little girl, Demi-Leigh Armstrong, 5, from Ashford, Middlesex, complained that her friend was short of a musical instrument during a sing-song, Kate offered her a rattle. 'Do you want to give him this one?' she asked Demi-Leigh, who replied emphatically: 'No,' before turning her back on the Duchess.

By the end of the visit, however, Kate
 had won around the little girl, who is recovering from a kidney 
transplant operation after contracting a rare condition, HUS, that 
attacked her vital organs.

Demi-Leigh,
 helped give her a posy of roses and the Duchess wished her happy 
Christmas. 'But it's not Christmas yet,' said Demi-Leigh.

'Bye then,' said Kate.

'Oh give me a hug first,' said the little girl, grabbing her leg, and the pair exchanged a thumbs up.

Demi-Leigh,
 who received her transplant a year and a half ago after her mother 
Jayne Figgins, 33, donated a kidney will need a further 
transplant at some point.

'You've just got to get on with it. You know 
the kidney will fail because it will one day. Next time she'll probably 
have to wait for a donor,' said Jayne.

Kate, who is royal patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices, spent an hour and 20 minutes touring the hospice, which has beds for 10 children and daycare facilities for more at any one time.

In a private room she comforted the parents of a one-year-old girl who died on Tuesday. The parents lost their five-year-old son from the same condition, spinal muscular atrophy, six weeks ago.

 and 20 minutes touring the hospice, which has beds for 10 children and 
daycare facilities for more at any one time.

She seemed at ease as she met the families of the children being treated, as well as the staff and volunteers.

She was smart but casually dressed for the occasion in navy blue skinny jeans and a grey 
£275 Reiss jacket with £225 black wedge ankle boots from Russell and Bromley.

The hospice is run by Shooting Star Chase, a charity which cares for 650 children and young people with life-limiting conditions at its centres in Hampton and Guildford

Kate spent most of her time asking parents about their children and their experience of Shooting Star Chase, which runs the hospice and one in Guildford, Surrey.

But she did reveal that her baby son, Prince George, had just been introduced to 'messy play'.

Mother Louise Wilks from Harefield, west London, said: 'She was so sweet, absolutely lovely and she really puts you at ease because obviously you are a little tense to meet someone so important. She was down to earth but had a real aura about her.

'She asked me about my boys and how we use Shooting Star Chase and I told her how they like messy play. She said she has just introduced George to messy play and what fun it was.'

The Duchess also chatted at length to Nicola Dasilva, 25, from Merton, south London, whose 21-month-old son Frankie was so poorly he was given a week to live when he first arrived at the hospice last year. 'He's still here. He's a fighter,' said Nicola.

Frankie, who is blind, fed from a tube, and dependent on oxygen due to a rare bone condition, infantile osteoporosis, is still not expected to live beyond the age of three but his mother told Kate she had found his two-month respite care at the hospice a great help.

'I've got a three-year-old girl as well,' she told Kate, who replied: 'Gosh, you've got your hands full.'

During her tour, the Duchess also tried her hand at art, drawing a dog with floppy ears in a therapy session for children.

Another parent Britt Armstrong-Gash, 
from New Malden, Surrey, told Kate there was little support for families 
outside the hospice.

'She was really lovely, very sincere, her 
beauty shone from within,' she said. ,She asked about how we use the 
facilities here and what life is like.  I told her how we get very 
little support from outside and how important Shooting Star Chase is to 
us.

Mother Alison Buck, from East Moseley, revealed that some of the 
children had been expecting another visitor. She said: 'We hadn't told 
our children who was coming, we just said it was someone really special.
 They thought it was Mr Tumbles but they certainly weren't disappointed 
when the Duchess walked in.'

The Duchess also met volunteers who help out at the hospice. She
 plans to launch a new initiative to encourage more people to volunteer 
in hospices.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'The Royal 
Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is 
currently developing a pilot for a volunteering programme to support 
families of children with life-limiting conditions. A key component of 
today's visit is for The Duchess to meet a group of Shooting Stars 
volunteers, to better understand how they support the hospice and its 
families.'

Kate
 became royal patron of East Anglia Children's Hospices following
 her marriage to the Duke of Cambridge and has become involved in the 
extended hospice network around the UK. In April 2013, she recorded a video message in support of Children's Hospice Week.

In it, she said: 'Children's hospices 
provide lifelines to families at a time of unimaginable pain. The 
support they give is vital. In order to carry out this wonderful work, 
our help is needed.

'With our support, those providing 
children's palliative care can continue to offer these extraordinary 
services. It does not bear thinking about what these families would do 
without this.'

Earlier this year when she was pregnant, she visited Naomi House in Hampshire to draw attention to the wide range of services offered by children's hospices.

Today's visit came after Kate and Prince William attended a screening of the film Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, as news broke of the leader's death.

William paid tribute to the 95-year-old as they left the Odeon in Leicester Square last night. He said: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely sad and tragic news.

'We were just reminded what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson Mandela was. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's very sad.'

Kate wore a bespoke ivory Roland Mouret gown but kept up her reputation as a fan of the High Street by teaming it with a £19.99 Zara necklace that has since sold out.

The Duke of Cambridge has presented medals to members of the Irish Guards who have recently returned from operations in Afghanistan.

William, who is Colonel of the regiment, presented operational service medals to soldiers of No. 2 Company, 1st Battalion at Mons Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire.

Around 120 men received the medals in front of friends and family as the Duke's standard flew at half mast in tribute to former South African president Nelson Mandela, who died yesterday.

Honour: The soldiers were delighted the Prince could add some 'royal stardust' to the occasion

No. 2 Company returned from Helmand Province in October having served a six-month tour. The unit suffered no fatalities but did suffer some wounded.

After presenting the medals, William told the men: 'You did your job magnificently, helping the people of Helmand to face their future with greater security and confidence, and you all came home safe and sound.

The prince was in full uniform for the occasion as Colonel of the regiment

Proud: The prince spoke of the courage and professionalism of the regiment after the soldiers had just returned from Afghanistan

Back safely: The regiment suffered no fatalities during their time in Helmand

'This speaks greatly of your professionalism and to your care for one another. We are extremely proud of you, and glad beyond words that you are safely home.'

The Duke also briefly met some of the soldiers and their families.

No. 2 Company commander Major Jonathan Palmer said: 'It was fantastic, particularly for the families.To have, what you might call, some royal stardust is a vindication of the sacrifices they have made.'

The officer said that it was the professionalism and training of his men that ensured all of them came home but he said that on several occasions it had been 'a close call'.

Respect: A flag flew at half mast to mark the death of Nelson Mandela. The prince had been at a film screening about the leader when he heard of his passing
