Senior leaders at the BBC are still passing the buck. Or in this case, one might say the yuan.

BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten told a group of investigators that he blamed the ‘horrible screw-up’ surrounding the Jimmy Savile sex scandal on the ‘Chinese management style’ of the organization’s former director general Mark Thompson and the ineptitude of his successor George Entwistle, it was revealed Friday.

Lord Patten, the Trust’s chairman since May 2011, said the BBC had ‘more senior leaders than China’ under Thompson with 25 to 27 people on his senior management team.

‘They never met,’ Lord Patten said, according to recently published transcripts and appendices to The Pollard Report, which was released to the public in December.

Lord Patten told the Pollard investigators that the mishandling of the scandal continued after Thompson left due to the mismanaged team working under Entwistle.

‘I don't think the BBC needs more senior people in order to avoid making basic mistakes,’ Lord Patten said.

He said Entwistle's lack of knowledge of the Savile sex abuse investigation was ironic given how frequently Entwistle referred to the ‘silo’ culture that had taken form under Thompson during interviews for the top position.

Thompson, who became BBC's director general in June 2004, resigned in September and took over as chief executive of the New York Times in November. After his departure he told Andrew Marr, another former BBC employee, that the public broadcasting corporation was ‘getting very, very close to the edge’ after the latest round of cost-cutting.

Entwistle resigned from the director general role in November 2012, less than two months after succeeding Thompson.

Lord Patten told the Pollard investigators that the BBC’s acting director general Tim Davie, who took over when Entwistle resigned, has ‘two or three experienced people around him’ and that there is no longer an ‘impression of frantic faffing about’ when he walks into his office.

Lord Patten also denied having prior knowledge of a plan to make Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, who decided not to broadcast an investigation into Savile sex abuse allegations in December 2011, ‘the fall guy’ for the crisis that ensued after the scandal made headlines in October.

Savile, the former BBC television host who died last year at 84, is believed to have been one of Britain’s most prolific sex offenders after hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse and rape became public following his death.

Lord Patten told the investigators some people at the BBC thought Rippon would make ‘a convenient fall guy’ and could be ‘hung out to dry’ but that the BBC Trust ‘never got to that position.’

The BBC Trust chairman said he was misled by senior executives during the organization’s mishandling of the scandal.

Prior to joining the BBC, Lord Patten was the last governor of British Hong Kong before its handover to the People's Republic of China in July 1997.
