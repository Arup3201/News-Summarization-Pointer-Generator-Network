An Oregon man who beat his father and his father's girlfriend to death nearly two years ago was spared the death penalty but will spend the rest of his life in prison with no chance of parole, a judge ruled Tuesday.

Johan Gillette, 38, received two consecutive life sentences following emotional testimony from victims' relatives in Lane County Circuit Court.

Gillette could have faced the death penalty. But his own family and that of the other victim opposed execution, and Gillette's brother told his older sibling to sign a sentencing agreement that took the death penalty off the table in exchange for waiving some appeal rights.

Victims: Gillette was found guilty of murdering his father, James Gillette (left) and his father's girlfriend, Anne McLucas

A jury last week convicted Gillette of murdering his father James Gillette, 73, and the father's girlfriend, Anne McLucas, 71, at a home south of Eugene in September 2012.

Both died of multiple crushing blows to the head, delivered by what is believed to have been some kind of wrench. The murder weapon was never found.

Gillette maintained his innocence on Tuesday, telling the court that 'this is not a murder case' and he believes he'll get a new trial.

'The only tragedy in my opinion is Anne McLucas,' he said. 'I did this agreement for others, not myself.'

He did not make eye contact with McLucas' relatives who addressed the court, KVAL-TV reported.

'Johan, you murdered my mother, beat her, left her on the floor to die,' said Jacob Shapiro, McLucas' son. 'She was just caught up in a father-son argument.'

Gillette claimed he acted in self-defense when his father reached for a gun during an argument. During the trial, he took the stand to describe the fight.

Prosecutors said the younger Gillette flew into a rage over his father's plan to evict Gillette and his girlfriend from a trailer on the father's property.

Spared: The families of both victims argued against the death penalty for Gillette

Prosecutors focused on evidence that the victims continued to be beaten once they were on the ground.

James Gillette and McLucas were found in the bedroom of the main house. James Gillette already was dead when a man who worked for him discovered the crime scene. McLucas still clung to life but died the next day in a hospital.
