Roger Federer had a 10-minute row with rival Stan Wawrinka after Federer's wife 'heckled' him from the sidelines during their match.

Federer won the match 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 at the O2 in London on Saturday but his victory has been overshadowed by the fallout. 

It is understood that one of the reasons the Swiss compatriots fell out at their ATP Tour Finals semi-final was because Federer's wife Mirka heckled Wawrinka.

Born in Bojnice, Czechoslovakia in 1978, Mirka Vavrinec began her own tennis career at a young age and turned professional when she was 20.

She won three ITF titles during her career and reached a highest ranking of No 76 in the world in September 2001, but a persistent foot injury forced her to quit the game a year later.

She met Federer at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and married him in 2009. The couple have two sets of twins - identical twin girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva (born July 23, 2009) and twin boys Leo and Lennart (born May 6, 2014).

As well as looking after her children, Mirka often follows her husband on tour and is said to be a major factor in the huge success he has experienced over the last 11 years.

In an interview with Inside Tennis earlier this year, Federer said of his wife: 'I think every wife is important. Mine is no different. She's [always] been involved to some degree, but [she was more] involved, midway through our relationship. She came to every practice, every match, spent breakfast, lunch, and dinner together for years. 

'It's still very intense today, but we have kids and she's seen 900 matches, I guess. She's OK missing one once in a while and not coming to practices any more. She's been very important in my life, not just as a tennis player, but overall.'

Among Wawrinka's complaints is that she made audible comments from his supporters' box – which is at ground level – questioning in French whether he would have the guts to close the match. 

According to several eyewitnesses, a vociferous argument developed between the pair in the backstage area.

Tour officials decided that the best thing was to push them alone into a private room that had been converted into a gym area, as there is no communal locker room at the arena.

While the dispute is not believed to have become physical, a heated 10-minute row ensued in which both aired their grievances against the other. 

In what had been an unusually feisty and high quality semi-final, Wawrinka had four match points and served for the match at 5-4.

According to French television, Wawrinka was picked up saying: 'She did the same thing at Wimbledon.'

John McEnroe spoke of the dispute on American television, but he seemed unaware of the extent to which it has escalated, according to those Sportsmail has spoken to.

Another cause of tension in matches between the two is said to be the presence in Federer's box of Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi, who coaches the world No 2 along with Stefan Edberg.

Although doing his best to stay impartial in these encounters, it is not hard to see why Wawrinka might resent his team competition captain siding with his rival when it comes to their head-to-head combat. 

Ultimately the Swiss No 2 was unable to finish the job off and was denied a place in the final of the prestigious year-end championships, with well-placed sources saying he was furious at the intervention of Mrs Federer.

Next up for Swiss duo Federer and Wawrinka is the Davis Cup final against France.

The three-day team event, which begins on Friday, could see the pair joining forces in a doubles match at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille.

Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer are the other members of the Switzerland team. 

There was no comment from the Federer camp on Monday morning, but the situation is especially delicate because on Friday the two men, who have got on well in the past, are playing for Switzerland in the Davis Cup final against France.

It is the only major prize in tennis to have eluded the 17-time Grand Slam champion, and he will be relying on his long-time colleague to help him achieve that last ambition, particularly if they are paired together for a doubles match. They were leaving for Lille on Monday morning where the match will be played inside the city's football stadium.

While the undoubted row between the two men is a distraction, it was not the main cause of Federer pulling out of Sunday night's final, although the tension it caused is unlikely to have helped. The Swiss master, drained by the physically and mentally exhausting match against Wawrinka, sustained a pull in his back and clearly did not wish to risk it ahead of the Davis Cup final.

Federer usually manages to avoid controversy and his wife says little in public, despite playing a major role in her 33 year-old husband's phenomenal career.

Those who know her speak of someone quietly formidable and determined who behind the scenes helps organise the incredibly busy life of her spouse, with whom she now has two sets of twins.

A former player herself, when she was known as Miroslava Vavrinec, she reached a career high singles ranking of 76 and met the soon-to-be superstar at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, she had to retire from the sport with a persistent foot injury and has since channelled her energies into helping her husband become the global icon that he now is.

Aside from maintaining his fitness and training regime and having four young children, Federer also has a large portfolio of sponsorships and has his own personal charitable foundation that he attends to.

Mirka, who married him in 2009, is said to be a key component in making his life run like a Swiss clock to keep the success going. 

She is also known to have steely side, and it seems that is what has led to the fallout with Wawrinka that could be a threat to Switzerland's Davis Cup dreams.
