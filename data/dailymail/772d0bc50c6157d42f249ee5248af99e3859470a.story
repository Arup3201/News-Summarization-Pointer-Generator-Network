The hidden loft said to have inspired the 'madwoman in the attic' of Jane Eyre is being opened to public tours for the first time.

Charlotte Brontë was reportedly captivated when she saw the room in the stately home of Norton Conyers, North Yorkshire, on a visit in 1839.

The novelist heard how in the 18th Century, a 'madwoman' nicknamed Mad Mary was locked in the attic so she would be hidden away from the niceties of life in Britain's upper class.

Foreboding: This attic in Norton Conyers, North Yorkshire, will be opened to pre-booked tours for the first time next year and is likely to be a hot ticket among book-lovers - as it reportedly inspired the events of Jane Eyre

Secret: This dilapidated staircase to the attic room made headlines around the world in 2004 when the home's owners, Sir James and Lady Graham, discovered its existence and found it related closely to one in the book

]When Brontë wrote her 1847 classic Jane Eyre, she created the character of Bertha Mason - Edward Rochester's Creole first wife who he locks away in the upper floors of his sprawling manor.

The link between the two homes was cemented in 2004 when Norton Conyers' owners, Sir James and Lady Graham, discovered a forgotten stairway in their home which is described vividly in the book.

Now the public will be able to book tours of the attic for the first time after a long-running £500,000 conservation project to stop the house from falling into disrepair.

Sir James and Lady Graham, who emptied the house for the overhaul in 2006, made the announcement as their project won a major award. 

The restoration prize, to be announced tomorrow by the Historic House Association and auction house Sotheby's, recognises a long struggle by the couple to make the attic accessible to more people.

Lady Graham told MailOnline: 'While we're restoring other parts of the house, we wanted to leave the attic exactly as it is. It wouldn't have the right atmosphere if it was given a new coat of paint.

'The house itself is extremely ancient - we've discovered it has Viking origins and the timbers including in the attic date to the late Medieval period - so we can't have hordes of people.'

Although the uneven, wonky staircase will not be suitable for everyone, the couple hope to open the attic rooms to pre-booked small groups from July next year. 

The Mad Mary story was unsurprising given the times in which she lived, Lady Graham added.

'If you had a relative that was mad or eccentric it would be a social disgrace,' she said. 'If you had someone with symptoms of madness you would hide them as far away from everybody as you could.'

The house made headlines around the world in 2004 when the owners, who have had Norton Conyers in their family since 1624, found a hidden staircase to their attics.

Many believe the stairway, which leads eventually to the furthest room where the 'madwoman' was said to have lived, is the same one described as leading to the attic in the fictional Thornfield Hall.

In the classic book, Bertha Mason lives hidden in the attic as her husband Edward Rochester courts his home's young governess, Jane Eyre.

But on the eve of her wedding, his spurned wife sneaks into Jane's room at night and rips her wedding veil in two.

Eventually the secret is discovered and ends in tragedy, when Mr Rochester's first wife burns down the house and takes her own life.

Her 'madness' has been interpreted by many scholars as a study of how Englishmen of the time unfairly stereotyped foreigners - from Jamaica, in her case - as wild people who had to be tamed.
