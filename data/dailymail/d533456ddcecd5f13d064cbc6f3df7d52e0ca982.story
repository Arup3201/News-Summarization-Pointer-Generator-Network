A town has voted not to fly the flag of St George in case it offends Muslims.

Radstock in Somerset has a population of 5,620, 16 of them Muslim, census data shows.

But a Labour councillor said the red and white cross could upset people because of its links to the Crusades.

Eleanor Jackson, a university lecturer, said: ‘My big problem is it is offensive to some Muslims, but even more that it has been hijacked by the far Right.’

The council agreed with her proposal 
not to buy a St George’s flag for the town’s repaired flagpole. A Union 
Flag will be flown on Armistice Day and there are plans for a flag to be
 designed for Radstock.

Chairman Lesley Mansell said: ‘We do 
not have a Union Jack and the discussion was about purchasing one to fly
 mainly for Armistice Day.

‘The council confirmed its original decision to purchase a Union Jack.’

John Clements, of patriotic group the 
Royal Society of St George, condemned the council’s decision for 
‘censoring’ the national flag, and playing into the hands of the far 
Right.

Rizwan Ahmed, spokesman for the 
Bristol Muslim Cultural Society, said: ‘To say that  Muslims are 
offended I don’t think is correct.

Decision: Radstock Town Council's offices in Somerset. Officials agreed with the proposal of Labour councillor Eleanor Jackson not to buy a new St George's flag for the town's repaired civic flagpole

‘We understand the flag is part of this country’s heritage, and in fact many Muslims  identify as being British.’

Radstock resident Irene Burchell, 76, 
said: ‘The council does not speak for the people of Radstock, and it 
certainly doesn’t speak for me.

‘I think it is absolute nonsense. The St George’s flag has been adopted by England for centuries.’

Concerns: Labour councillor Eleanor Jackson insisted the flag could still cause upset to Muslims

The rainbow flag of the lesbian, gay,
 bisexual, and transgender pride movement will also be raised at 
‘appropriate’ times of the year.

The
 council will also be flying the In Bloom flag at the Miners’ Memorial 
Garden to celebrate the town’s gardening achievements - and there are 
plans for a specially-designed flag for Radstock.

Muslim Council of Britain spokesman Nasima Begum said her group encouraged the flying of the St George’s flag.

She said: ‘St George needs to take his rightful place as a national symbol of inclusivity rather than a symbol of hatred.

'St George actually lived before the birth of Islam and should not be associated with any hatred of Muslims.’

And Rizwan Ahmed added: ‘It is political correctness going a bit too far.

'Use by the far right is one thing, but to say that Muslims are offended I don’t think is correct.'

The Crusades was a centuries-long series of military campaigns waged by Christians from Europe.

St George became an English hero during the crusades against the Muslim armies that captured Jerusalem in the 11th century.

An apparition of George is said to have appeared to the crusader army at the Battle of Antioch in 1098. His dragon-slaying legend is thought to have begun as an allegory of Diocletian's persecution of Christians.

‘I think if anything this will harm 
understanding of Muslim people, and it feeds into the ideas that some 
people have of “Oh, here they go again, pandering to the needs of Muslim
 people”, when actually it is not offensive.

‘I can see why they have done this, but it really is too far.

'They are being overly sensitive, and making assumptions about what Muslims will be offended by.

‘In actual fact we are normal people.

'We have a sense of humour and have the same concerns as everyone else - we are not just some single group.’

There is no mosque or prayer centre in Radstock, meaning the few members of the Muslim community are forced to go to Bristol or nearby Bath in order to pray.
