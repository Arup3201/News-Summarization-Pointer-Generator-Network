Punch-up: Krystel Coleman, 29, sister of the bride, was allegedly punched unconscious by her own uncle

A wedding reception ended in disaster when a family brawl over a piece of chicken saw the bride's sister punched unconscious - by her own uncle.

Krystel Coleman, 29, 
was left with a broken nose and two black eyes after Curt Hughes, 53,  allegedly 
punched her at her sister Karyssa's wedding

The fight erupted when the best man pushed into the buffet queue to get food for his son, which is said to have upset uncle-of-the-bride Hughes.

The 53 year old lorry driver is said to have then hit best man, and brother-of-the-groom, Danny Smethurst, 30, and the bride's father Kevin 
Coleman, 52.

Ten police vehicles had to be sent to Caldecott Hall hotel in Fritton near Great Yarmouth,
 Norfolk, as angry wedding guests fought in the car park outside the reception.

Even the bride's mother  Liza Coleman, 47, was knocked to the ground during the scuffle last Friday.

Bride Karyssa Smethurst,
 28, of Gorleston, Norfolk, who is eight months pregnant, then had to drive 
her sister Krystel to hospital after an ambulance failed to turn up.

The groom, Ben Smethurst, 
26, said the brawl started at the buffet table after his brother reached 
over to get a piece of chicken for his 11-year-old son.

He said: ‘Curt thought he was pushing 
in the queue, and called him "a fat c***". My brother just told him 
there was no need to use that sort of language.

‘People were them dancing and enjoying themselves and everything was fine until it was time to leave.

‘Curt was heard saying that he should never have come to the wedding as it was s*** and the food was crap.

‘He was just trying to belittle my 
wedding so my brother Danny said, 'Why don't you just f*** off then you 
d*******'. Danny then got punched.’

Wedding disaster: Ben and Karyssa Smethurst had their special day ruined when her uncle started a fight with Ben's brother at the buffet and allegedly punched him and Karyssa's father as well as gave Karyssa's sister Krystal a broken nose and two black eyes, leaving her unconscious for 20 minutes

Mother-of-three Krystel, also
 of Gorleston, Norfolk, said: ‘My mum went up to Curt to push him out 
into the car park and told him, 'Don't you ruin my daughter's wedding'.

‘Then Curt's wife Elaine who is my mum's sister got involved. They were both shouting at my mum.

‘I went over to Curt and said, "What are you playing at? Leave my mum alone". Then he punched me.

‘I was out cold for about 20 minutes and was taken to the toilet where I was laid out on the floor until I came round.

‘My dad went up to Curt and they were pushing each other. Then my dad got hit and was left with a big lump on his head.

‘Another five or six people got involved. One bloke jumped on Curt's back to try and stop him because he was going crazy.

Family celebrations: Ten police vehicles had to be called to Caldecott Hall in Fritton, where the wedding took place, to separate the fighting guests

'My mum also ended up on the floor and was knocked out for a little while.

‘My sister tried to come rushing out but everyone was holding her back as she was just three weeks away from giving birth.

Argument: Krystal was punched by her uncle after she stepped in to defend her mother

‘Curt was about to get in a taxi, but Karyssa bravely told the driver not to take him until police arrived.’

Mr Hughes, a former bouncer of 
Bradwell near Great Yarmouth was arrested on suspicion of assault and 
later released on police bail pending further inquiries.

Beauty
 therapist Krystel said she came round to hear her younger son Diego, 
five, saying 'Mummy's dead' after he saw her lying on the floor.

Krystel added: ‘It was supposed to be my sister's special day and it was ruined at the end.

‘It
 had been so special up until then, honestly a perfect day. Kurt was 
arrested and is now out on bail.

'The worst bit is, he hasn't apologised.
 It's just dreadful.’

A 
Norfolk Police spokesperson said: ‘Police were called to Caldecott Hall 
Hotel in Fritton, near Great Yarmouth, shortly before midnight on Friday
 5 July following reports of a disturbance.

‘Officers
 arrived on scene to find a number of people involved in an altercation 
and a woman in her 20s suffered facial injuries during the incident.

‘A 53-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault and released on bail while the investigation continues.’

Elaine Hughes, 48, said: ‘My husband does not wish to comment.’
