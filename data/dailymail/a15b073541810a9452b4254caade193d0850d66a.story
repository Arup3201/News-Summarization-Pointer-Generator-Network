Gunners' boss Arsene Wenger has been chasing the French international and had hoped he could convince him to make the switch from the Spanish capital.

The 26-year-old striker signed for Real in 2009 from Lyon and has scored an impressive 111 goals in 235 games.

Spanish giants Real have been linked with Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Manchester City hitman Sergio Aguero, leading to speculation regarding Benzema's future at the Sanitago Bernabeu.

Real beat Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final to claim 'La Decima' - the club's 10th European Cup - and Benzema has revealed that he is happy at the club and is not agitating for a move.

He told L’Equipe Magazine: 'I feel at home in Madrid. I am really at ease.

'Playing at Real Madrid is a joy and fills me with pride because it is the greatest club in the world and also because I have come through some difficult moments in my five years here.'

The Frenchman also said that he will be fully fit the World Cup after being selected in the 23-man squad for Brazil.
