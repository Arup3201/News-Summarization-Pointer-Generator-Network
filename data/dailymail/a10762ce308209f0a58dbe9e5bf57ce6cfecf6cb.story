Fresh violence in Kishtwar left 10 people injured, including an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), as J&K home minister Sajjad Ahmad Kichloo resigned from the cabinet on Monday over accusations of inciting violence in the town.

Trouble started on Monday when police tried to stop protesters from marching to the Hidyal area in Kishtwar defying the curfew in the town.

The curfew has been in place in Kishtwar and eight other districts of Jammu since Friday when communal violence erupted in Kishtwar town killing three people and injuring over 30.

Locals were protesting against the arrest of a youth for his alleged involvement in Friday's clash. ASP Kulbir Singh and a Selection Grade Constable were among six people injured in the clashes on Monday.

Police said four policemen were injured on Sunday night in Kishtwar when unknown miscreants attacked their vehicle and set it on fire.

All-party meet

To contain the communal tension, chief minister Omar Abdullah chaired an all-party meeting in Jammu. He told the leaders present in the meeting that the state government has ordered a time-bound judicial inquiry into the violence by a retired judge of the high court.

Sajjad Ahmad Kichloo, the MLA from Kishtwar whom the BJP is accusing of instigating violence in the town, said since the chief minister has ordered a probe into the incident, he has resigned so that the investigation is free and fair.

"From Jammu to New Delhi, the BJP did everything to malign my image. My presence in Kishtwar saved hundreds of lives and people from both communities - Muslims and Hindus - have faith on me.

"But the BJP wants to create political capital out of Kishtwar riots. I would deny them that chance. My secular credentials cannot be doubted. I get votes from both the communities," Kichloo told Mail Today.

Resignation

Kichloo was in Kishtwar, which is his hometown and home constituency, when the riots broke out in the district after Eid prayers.

He said his uncle had died and it was the reason he was in the constituency.

"My family and I have a track record of 60 years in politics. My father late Bashir Ahmad Kichloo and I have always stood for probity and transparency in public life and secularism has been the bedrock of our political ideology," 45-year-old Kichloo said.

Reminding the BJP of 2002 riots in 
Gujarat, Kichloo said: "I take strong exception to what Mr Arun Jaitley 
has said. Did Modi resign after Gujarat? What happened to Amit Shah who 
is now the star campaigner of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh?

"Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones on others."

Omar Abdullah, too, hit out at the BJP after the latter created uproar over Kishtwar riots in Parliament.

Reminding
the saffron party of 2002 Gujarat riots, he tweeted: "Would (Arun) 
Jaitley be so kind as to inform Parliament whether the Gujarat home 
minister or MoS Home resigned or even offered to in 2002!" Omar also 
identified the three persons killed in the violence.

"Three
unfortunate deaths - 1 Hindu, 2 Muslim and we've a judicial inquiry 
with my minister resigning. Would the BJP care to recount 2002 
response?"

Angry Omar

Soon after the violence broke out in Kishtwar, the Jammu and Kashmir government had called out the Army for a flag march in the town.

"Oh that's right they can't because their star PM hopeful waited days to call out the army and has yet to apologise. Hypocrites," Omar's third tweet read.

The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party accused the chief minister of playing "communal politics" by disclosing that two Muslims and one Hindu were killed in the clashes.

Party president Mehbooba Mufti said the chief minister had no business to divide victims on religious lines. "He made it communal," Mehbooba said.

A government spokesman said Omar has announced immediate relief of up to Rs 2 lakh each in favour of affected house owners and shopkeepers whose properties have been damaged or looted in the clashes.

Unhappy with the state government's response in handling the violence in Kishtwar, the Ministry of Home Affairs has sent a law and order maintenance advisory to Omar.

In the advisory, the home ministry has told the state government that the violence may spread to other parts and asked it to ensure that no such incident is repeated anywhere else.

Assuring all help, the Centre said adequate forces would be deployed in all sensitive places to maintain law and order.

Police on Monday arrested Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik. Malik had planned to go for peaceful march against Kishtwar violence.

Free hand: Defence minister A K Antony has given a clear message to Army commanders that they are free to respond to ceasefire violations as they see fit

Fireworks are expected to intensify on the Line of Control (LoC) as the army has been given a free hand by the government to respond appropriately to ceasefire violations in the wake of the killing of five Indian soldiers by Pakistan army regulars in Poonch sector last week.

The message has gone loud and clear to formation commanders by Indian Army chief General Bikram Singh and he has also advised them to remain aggressive while guarding the sanctity of the LoC.

Sources said local formations have been asked to retaliate with force any violation of ceasefire through heavy fire.

Apart from the LoC, even the international border has witnessed flare ups in recent days with firing also reported from the Jammu sector.

Pakistan has claimed one of its civilians has been killed in the firing in Sialkot. Sources said there was no ambiguity that Pakistan army regulars were behind the Poonch killing and it was sternly conveyed to the Pakistan Army when director generals of military operations of two sides spoke to each other a day after the incident.

The Indian Army will now respond at a tactical level either through heavy retaliatory firing or by making cross border raids.

The Nawaz Sharif government has no immediate plan to grant the most favoured nation (MFN) status to India, Pakistan finance minister Ishaq Dar said on Monday.

"There is no immediate consideration to grant India MFN status," Dar told Hamid Mir on Geo News program 'Capital Talk'.

Denial: Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has denied that the country's Army were involved in recent breaches of the LoC

At the same time, he stressed on normalising ties with New Delhi on a number of issues. It must be noted that India had granted MFN status to Pakistan in 1996.

For the past few days, the two neighbours have traded charges regarding LoC ceasefire violations.

Tension along the LoC was sparked following the killing of five Indian jawans in Poonch sector on August 6.

While New Delhi has accused Pakistani troops of killing its soldiers, Islamabad has denied involvement of its forces.

Earlier, there were reports stating that Pakistan has deployed additional troops in Kasur and Okara districts.

The Pakistan's Defence Ministry, however, denied the reports.

"Reports suggesting deployment of Pakistani troops across the LoC or adjacent districts are not true. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif himself is in-charge of Ministry of Defence that allows deployment of troops anywhere in country. He did not issue any such directive," a senior official of the Ministry told Mail Today.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gopal Baglay to convey its concern over BSF firing from across the LoC.

"The Foreign Office summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner this afternoon to raise this concern which has resulted in the loss of an innocent civilian life in Rawalakot," a MoFA spokesperson said.
