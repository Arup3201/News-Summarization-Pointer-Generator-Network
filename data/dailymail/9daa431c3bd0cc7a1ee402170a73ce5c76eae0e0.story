A Georgia high school football player died during a pre-season game Friday night.

DeAntre Turman, 16, and only a junior at Creekside High School, died of a broken neck after making a routine tackle. He had considerable interest from major college football programs and was considered one of the state’s top recruits for next year’s graduating class.

Turman had already been offered a full scholarship to play football for the University of Kentucky, according to ESPN.

A tragic end to a promising young life: DeAntre Turman died less than a month before his 17th birthday

Called ‘Tre Tre’ by friends, Turman was one of only a couple dozen juniors with Division-1 scholarships. A young life with seemingly limitless potential was cut short by what the medical examiner called ‘blunt force trauma,’ according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

A cornerback, Turman was an aggressive defender making a clean, solid tackle on a wide receiver in the open field, according to witnesses who spoke to local media. Nothing about the play seemed out of the ordinary until he didn’t get up after the tackle.

T%alented: Turman was 'definitely one of the best players' at a football camp he attended over the summer

‘Tre broke on it, dislodged the ball and his body just went limp. (He) immediately just went limp and he was on the ground,’ coach Glenn Ford told WSB.

‘[Everyone was] calling out his name, just trying to get him to come back to open his eyes up to move until the ambulance got there,’ Ford added. The ambulance arrived 15 minutes later, Turman was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Turman fractured the third vertebrae in his neck, according to the medical examiner.

The young star attended a football camp during the summer and was slated to play in a December all-star game. As a tribute his number two jersey will not be worn by anyone on the field, according to the Journal-Constitution.

‘He was definitely one of the best players at the camp, and the thing I really loved about him, that he was real quiet and reserved,’ Joe Burns, co-founder of RisingSeniors.com, told the Journal-Constitution. ‘He was one of those kids that was really focused, and trying to make the most out of the opportunity.’

Other experts agreed, Turman had real potential.

A national recruiting analyst told the Journal-Constitution that ‘it was a no-brainer to invite Turman to the camp because of how well he made plays on the ball and defended receivers.’

Former coach Johnny White had nothing but praise for Turman.

‘He’s one of the best kids I’ve ever dealt with in my 18 years of coaching, period, hands down,’ White told WSB. ‘He was quiet, but always smiling. He had a real good spirit. It was always yes sir, no sir. He enjoyed his team, and he loved his teammates. Just a great kid’

The fallen star’s mother died when he was young, his guardian told WSB of his love for football.

‘That is what made him the happiest. Being the competitor and playing different sports made him happy,’ said Tarsha Keller, adding that Turman’s dream was to get a college scholarship and play at the next level - a dream he came so close to realizing.

High school football players rarely die on the field, with an average of only three deaths a year the past decade, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina.

No players died last year, the first season without a death in almost 20 years.
