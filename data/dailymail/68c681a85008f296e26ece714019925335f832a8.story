Fashion being the fickle beast it is, there's no guarantee this will last for ever.

So, ladies, if you're fed up of wobbling along on perilously high heels, grab your chance to ditch them while you can â€“ because flats are finally in vogue.

Designers are swapping stilettos and platform heels for more comfortable footwear, according to industry insiders.

Changing fashions: Industry insiders say designers are swapping stilettos and platform heels for flats

And the catwalk trend has already reached the high street, where sales of flats and trainers have rocketed over the past few months.

The likes of Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn were seen sporting Burberry's micro-low wedges and Christopher Kane's flat shiny boots during London Fashion Week.

Cool Britannia: Roberto Cavalli said the influence is coming from London

And at his Milan fashion show, Italian designer Roberto Cavalli said: 'Women are wearing trainers now and lower heels. It's the street influence. It's cool and it's all coming from London.'

At Kurt Geiger, lower heels now account for about 60 per cent of sales, while at Debenhams sales of flat or low-heeled shoes have risen by 25 per cent in the past six months.

Sales of comfortable shoes at John Lewis have doubled in the past year, and last week's figures were up by 153 per cent on the same period in 2011.

Rebecca Farrar-Hockley, creative director at Kurt Geiger, said: 'There's definitely a radical shift towards lower heels. Sneakers are really on trend.

'Sneakers are really on trend. Girls are getting used to being able to run about and I don't think they are going back to the big high heels.'

Helen Attwood, footwear buying manager for Selfridges, added: 'It's a revolution. Out of all our footwear categories we are repeating orders mostly on flats and trainers. They are selling out across every price point.'

Kate Ormrod, a fashion analyst at retail analyst Verdict, said the Royal Wedding may have influenced the new trend.

She said: 'Low platforms and wedges and nude finishes are on trend, particularly due to high interest in the styles worn by the Duchess of Cambridge.

'There has been a move towards more comfortable styles and catwalk trends are quicker to filter down to the high street.'

Trend-setters: The shift is partly down to the likes of Cara Delevingne being seen out and about in trainers

Even Victoria Beckham, who is often seen pioneering the latest towering heels, was photographed in New York this winter wearing monk-strap flat shoes.

She also dressed the models in her spring 13 catwalk show in Manolo Blahnik monks.

And students at the London College of Fashion are also cottoning on to the new craze with designs for their degree projects.

According to course leader Sue Sanders, students are increasingly ditching heels for flat designs with 'strappy, complicated constructions'.

Francesca Burns, fashion editor of Vogue magazine, told the Sunday Times said the trend of teaming 'casual trainers with posh frocks'began last year and had been adopted by well-known figures such as Agyness Deyn, the model, and Kristen Stewart, the actress.

She said: 'It's a rebellion - it's about mixing high and low together.'
