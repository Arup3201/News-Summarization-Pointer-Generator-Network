Raheem Sterling is in line for a new Liverpool contract that will cement his status as one of Europe's top young players.

Talks over fresh terms are set to commence after the World Cup, with the deal likely to see the teenage sensation net a significant pay rise from his current £35,000-per-week contract.

Liverpool know a successful World Cup will see Sterling's profile sky-rocket and could lead to interest from rival clubs.

And steps are being taken to ward off potential interest by offering the 19-year-old a new five-year deal, worth up to £100,000-per-week - putting him among the best paid players at Anfield.

Sterling was at the forefront of Liverpool's title challenge last season, his sensational form helping him break into Roy Hodgson's plans for Brazil 2014.

The youngster is being tipped to become one of England's star men in South America - and he is now set to be rewarded by Reds boss Brendan Rodgers.
