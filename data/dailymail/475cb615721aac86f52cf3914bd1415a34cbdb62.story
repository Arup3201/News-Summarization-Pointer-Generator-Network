The runaway French mother of three children found dead at their home with their throats slit has been arrested by police.

She was held in Paris after a police hunt was launched following the discovery of the siblings aged nine, 11 and 17.

Their father, who is a doctor, raised the alarm when he returned home in the morning from work, police and judicial sources said.

Grim: The body of one of the stabbed children is removed from the house in the suburban town of Dampmart, 19 miles outside Paris

House of death: The home where the three children were stabbed. Two of them were dead at the scene while the eldest, aged 17, died later

Investigation: A forensic officer leaves the scene in the town of Dampmart after the discovery of the children

The authorities said: 'The children had their throats slit but we are still awaiting forensic reports.'

Two of the bodies, the nine-year-old girl and her 11-year-old brother had multiple stab wounds.

When the emergency services arrived the eldest brother was still alive but he later died of his injuries.

The killings took place in the suburban town of Dampmart, 30kilometres (19 miles) east of Paris, in the Seine-et-Marne region.

Their father was found in a state of shock and neighbours said he rushed out of his home screaming when he discovered the bodies.

Hunt for evidence: A forensic officer enters the children's home in Dampart, east of Paris.

Alert: Police officers watch as the forensic officers examine the outside of the house where the children were stabbed

A shocked neighbour said: 'Everyone knew them here. It's unbelievable, adding that the family was 'discreet' and 'had no problems.'

However investigators said the couple were undergoing marital problems.
