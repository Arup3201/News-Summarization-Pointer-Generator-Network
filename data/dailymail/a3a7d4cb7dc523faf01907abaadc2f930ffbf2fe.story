A Royal Navy engineer is sailing to Africa as part of Britain’s ebola task force just days after learning the virus has killed eight members of his family and infected a further six.

Christian Blango, 28, from South London, is on a mission to Sierra Leone after hearing that ebola had spread through his family’s village.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Blango turned down an offer of compassionate leave after he told Navy top brass of the deaths.

Naval airman Blango said: ‘This is personal now and the deaths in my family have made me even more determined to help people suffering with ebola.

‘Even my commander asked me not to go because of my family circumstances but I still wanted to go and help. I am proud to do my part and to contribute to the vital humanitarian work.

‘I was aware of the ebola situation in Sierra Leone but it never occurred to me it would affect my own family. I was prepared to go before I knew that my family was involved but knowing that has made me even more determined.

‘I just want to help, not only because of my family, although that has made me more passionate.’

He told his father: ‘Somebody has got to do something about it and I’m very pleased we have decided to provide aid. Sierra Leone does not have the infrastructure needed to cope and it would be a disaster for the country if we didn’t help. It is an honour for me to play a part.’

Blango joined the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) in 2009 after obtaining an engineering degree from the University of Greenwich. He is currently sailing to Sierra Leone aboard British hospital ship RFA Argus.

His job on board is to service and maintain three Merlin helicopters which, once the vessel arrives off the coast of the country’s capital Freetown this week, will deliver food and medical supplies to remote areas.

Blango was able to speak to his parents from Gibraltar last week while the ship docked to allow vehicles to be driven aboard. He told his father, Columba, that he was in a good mood after being granted shore leave and finding a McDonald’s restaurant near the docks.

Last night 58-year-old Columba Blango, a former Mayor of Southwark, in South East London, said: ‘Christian joined the Royal Navy for the purpose of humanity.

‘He loves it and he knows he is doing the right thing now, and he considered it his duty to serve his nation.

‘His mother and I are very proud of him. When we’ve spoken to him we’ve tried not to ask him too much about his ebola mission but he seems very positive about what he’s doing. After the terrible family news I was surprised he was emotionally ready to go but he is and I am encouraging him every step of the way.’

Christian Blango was born and raised in Britain but visited his extended family in Sierra Leone as a 17-year-old.

On September 11, three of his cousins living in the village of Moyamba Junction, situated 100 miles east of Freetown, began displaying symptoms of the virus.

The following day rescue workers from the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres took swabs which led to them being diagnosed with ebola. They subsequently died.

Then on September 17, two more cousins were diagnosed and later lost their lives.

Since then a further nine of his cousins have contracted ebola. Of these, three have died and six are receiving medical treatment.

The 28,000-ton RFA Argus set sail for Sierra Leone ten days ago. Once she arrives, she is likely to spend up to six months there.

Last night, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment.

More than 10,000 people have been infected with ebola, according to figures released yesterday by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Of those, 4,922 people have died, the WHO said. The ebola epidemic in West Africa is the largest ever outbreak of the disease with a rapidly rising death toll in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

There have also been cases in three other West African countries, Spain and the United States.

The UN health agency said yesterday the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases has risen to 10,141, with about 200 new cases since the last report, four days ago. But even those figures are likely to be an underestimate, the WHO has warned, as many in the hardest hit countries have been unable, or too frightened, to seek medical care. A shortage of labs capable of handling potentially infected blood samples has also made the virus hard to track.

It comes as authorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country’s first ebola patient, a two-year-old girl who had arrived from Guinea.

And the governors of New Jersey and New York have ordered a mandatory, 21-day quarantine of all medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with victims in West Africa.
