Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock billed taxpayers for more than $10,000 on private flights last fall, including a trip on a private jet to a Chicago Bears football game.

The flights last November don't include more than a dozen other trips on donors' planes that Schock has paid for out of his House office expenses or campaign funds since joining Congress in 2009.

Schock, a 33-year-old Republican representing Peoria, had already been facing scrutiny for using congressional funds to redecorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show 'Downton Abbey.' 

He repaid those charges last month out of his own pocket; his office had said it's reviewing other expenses.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday night that Schock flew from Peoria, Illinois to Chicago to attend a Bears game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 16, 2014 

Overall, according to the paper, he used $20,855 in taxpayer money for the Chicago trip and another to New York in September, where his political action committee spent another $3,000 for tickets to the Global Citizen Festival concert. 

This week Schock reportedly hired a pair of lawyers to audit his political and legislative operations. 

Spokesmen for Schock declined to comment to the Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune, and did not respond to a request from Daily Mail Online.

In a statement last week they said a legal team was already poring over 'compliance procedures in his official office, campaign and leadership PAC to determine whether they can be improved.'

The football game was part of a longer trip on a chartered six-seat business jet that took off from a civil aviation airport in Manassas, Virginia en route to Peoria on a Friday. 

The Bears defeated the Vikings but the game may ultimately defeat a congressman

The Sunday trip was a sideline before the aircraft returned to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport a day later.

All the seats were filled, according to pilot Keith Siilats, who told the Sun-Times that Schock's district director Dayne LaHood and three others were aboard.

He also said he accompanied the congressman and his group to the football game.

He was paid $10,802 for 'commercial transportation' in November, the last month for which numbers are available.

'That whole weekend was paid by the government,' he said. 

Schock 'called me on Saturday and said "what do you think about’ a Chicago trip?"' Siilats recalled for the paper.

Chicago Bears single-game tickets range in cost from $106 to $430. It's not clear who paid for them.
