Georgina Blackwell is celebrating securing a First Class Honours law degree

She may be a young blonde beautician from Essex but Georgina Blackwell certainly does not live up to any of the usual stereotypes.

Miss Blackwell first hit the headlines when, aged just 23 and with no formal legal qualification, took on one of the country’s biggest homebuilders in the High Court - and won.

And that proved to be a turning point for the 26-year-old who had almost given up on a dream of becoming a lawyer to work in the family-owned salon in 
picturesque Halstead, Essex, after her mum broke her wrist.

After the stunning success against Bellway in 2009, Miss Blackwell was offered a law scholarship at BPP University in London.

She is now celebrating again after securing a First Class honours in her law degree, the top grade possible.

A delighted Georgina said: ‘Just over 
two years ago I was working in the salon and I would never have dreamed 
that I would complete a law degree and get First Class Honours.

‘If someone had told me that, I would not have believed them.

‘It all has happened too quickly, I 
don’t feel as though I have had time to take it all in. The past couple 
of years have been a complete whirlwind for me.’

The qualified beautician, who will 
start training to become a barrister later this year, added: ‘I was 
waiting for my results to arrive on e-mail and I must have refreshed the
inbox a thousand times before they arrived.

‘When I saw that I had got a First, I was running around the garden, screaming my head off.

‘The neighbours must have thought I 
was completely crazy but I don’t care - I was just so relieved as I was 
totally focused on getting a First.’

Georgina added: ‘If it had not been 
for the legal battle against the developers, I am not sure I would have 
been where I am today, so it was a blessing in disguise.

‘I would have still be in the salon, like I had been for the previous six years, and this might not have ever happened.’

Georgina Blackwell is as comfortable in the beauty salon as she is presenting complex legal cases before a High Court judge

Miss Blackwell, from Colchester, Essex
acted as a lawyer for her mum Sandra, in a bitter battle against 
Bellway Homes after it had filled the garden next to their beauty salon 
with scaffolding and debris.

The beautician was dubbed ‘Legally Blonde’ after she secured an unlikely victory against the wealthy developers.

She said her dad, Clive, 72, had been a massive inspiration for her.

She
said: ‘Dad knew how upset I was when I could not take my original place
to study law, so when I phoned him and told him the news, he was so 
happy for me and was choked up.’

Georgina’s
success means she has been lucky enough to secure a scholarship which 
will pay for the majority of the £16,000 costs of her nine-month course 
to become a barrister.

Georgina had almost given up on fulfilling her dream of becoming a lawyer after ditching the chance to study law in order to work in the family's beauty salon to help her mother Sandra, right, who had broken her wrist

However, the costs of her commute into London from her home in Essex means that she will still be doing a part-time job to help fund the costs.

And she said, time allowing, she will always be happy to help out her mum, Sandra, 55, at her salon, House of Beauty.

Georgina’s legal journey started when 
her mum bought a Grade II-listed 600-year-old home - a former school and
tailor’s shop - to set up her beauty salon.

But
soon after moving in, Bellway Homes purchased an empty factory which 
backed onto the salon’s garden with the intention of building 43 homes.

Her
mum had been taken to court in July 2009 after she refused builders 
access across her garden to demolish two factory walls which formed part
of Bellway’s Church View development.

After
losing the case Mrs Blackwell was faced with losing her home and 
business after spending £3,000 on legal advice and was ordered to pay 
Bellway’scosts of £22,000 as well as a ‘five-figure sum’ in damages for 
delays to the building work.

Georgina Blackwell took on Belway Construction after they started demolishing their garden walls and building scaffolding over their garden in Halstead, Essex

After the original case, builders moved onto the garden and filled it with scaffolding.

Bright-spark
Georgina sprang into action, checking deeds and documents to the house 
and realised the right of access was only to reach one wall of the 
factory not two.

And despite coming face-to-face with 
the developer’s top legal team, Georgina wowed the court with her legal 
arguments and cross examination, going on to win the case.

In
the High Court, Mrs Justice Proudman overturned the previous decision 
and ordered Bellway Homes to pay Mrs Blackwell £75,000 compensation.

Speaking after the original hearing, Georgina said: ‘I’m a blonde beautician from Essex. I think they underestimated me.

Bellway put scaffolding in Mrs Blackwell's garden and began demolition, which was halted after they lost the court case

‘They looked intimidating in their wigs and gowns, it was terrifying. I felt absolutely scared stiff by the huge courtroom and speaking in front of a high court judge but I got a surge of adrenalin and thought, ‘they aren’t going to intimidate me’.’

After hearing of the case, Peter Crisp, Dean of BPP Law School wrote to Georgina in November 2009, offering her a scholarship.

She completed BPP’s two-year law degree programme, which started in May 2010 and finished last month.

Georgina will receive her degree at an official graduation ceremony in London in November.
