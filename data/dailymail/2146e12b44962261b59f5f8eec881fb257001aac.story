Chronic infection with the parasite Toxoplasma can make mice lose their innate, hard-wired fear of cats, effectively turning them into zombies

Chronic infection with the parasite Toxoplasma can make mice lose their innate, hard-wired fear of cats, effectively turning them into zombies.

The loss of their innate fear may persist after the parasite is no longer detectable in their brains, suggesting that initial infection may cause permanent changes in the rodents' brains.

Infected mice lose their fear of cats, 
which is good for both cats and the parasite, because the cat gets an 
easy meal and the parasite gets into the cat's intestinal track, the 
only place it can sexually reproduce and continue its cycle of 
infection.

A study by the University of California, Berkeley, found the mind-controlling parasite is even more powerful than was first thought.

Wendy Ingram, a graduate student at the university tested mice by seeing whether they avoided cat urine, which is normal 
behaviour, versus rabbit urine, to which mice don't react.

While
 earlier studies showed that mice lose their fear of cat urine for a few
 weeks after infection, Ingram showed that the three most common strains
 of Toxoplasma gondii make mice less fearful of cats for at least four 
months.

In the research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, even after infection with Toxoplasma gondii has 
been removed from rodents' brains, they continue to behave as if 
unafraid of the smell of cat urine, suggesting that the infection causes
 long-term changes in the brain.

Ms Ingram said: 'It is remarkable that even after the infection has been largely or completely cleared, a profound behavioral change persists.

Toxoplasma gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals

Up to a third of humans worldwide have been exposed to the infection

Mild flu-like symptoms occur within the first few weeks following exposure but produces no symptoms in healthy adults

In babies, HIV and AIDS patients and others with weakened immunity it can cause fatal toxoplasmosis

The infection can be transmitted by eating uncooked meat containing tissue cysts or through transmission from mother to fetus

The parasite reproduces only within the intestines of the cat family, which is defined as the host

A handful of studies have suggested subtle behavioural and personality changes can occur in infected humans (as well as mice)

'Simply having a transient infection resulting in what is potentially a permanent change in host biology may have huge implications for infectious disease medicine.'

The Toxoplasma parasite, which has flu-like symptoms, can be deadly, causing spontaneous abortion in pregnant women or killing immune-compromised patients, but it has a zombie-like effect in mice.

Ms Ingram speculates the parasite could directly alter neurons involved in memory and learning in mice, or it could trigger a damaging host response, as in many human autoimmune diseases.

She became interested in the parasite after reading about its behaviour-altering effects in mice and possible effects in its common host - the cat - as well as humans.

One-third of people around the world have been infected with Toxoplasma and probably have dormant cysts in their brains.

Kept in check by the body's immune system, these cysts sometimes revive in immune-compromised people, leading to death, and some preliminary studies suggest that chronic infection may be linked to schizophrenia or suicidal behaviour.

Infected mice lose their fear of cats, which is good for both cats and the parasite, because the cat gets an easy meal and the parasite gets into the cat's intestinal track, the only place it can sexually reproduce and continue its cycle of infection

Pregnant women are already warned to steer clear of cat litter, since the parasite is passed through cat faeces and can cause blindness or death in the fetus. One main source of spread is undercooked pork, Ms Ingram said.

She is now looking at how the mouse immune system attacks the parasite to see whether the host's response to the infection is the culprit.

Ms Ingram said: 'The idea that this parasite knows more about our brains than we do, and has the ability to exert desired change in complicated rodent behavior, is absolutely fascinating.

'Toxoplasma has done a phenomenal job of figuring out mammalian brains in order to enhance its transmission through a complicated life cycle.'

Researchers believe the animals' lack of fear occurs within three weeks of infection but the behavioral change persists in the absence of parasite cysts
