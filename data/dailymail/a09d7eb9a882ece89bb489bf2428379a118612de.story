Flood alerts have been issued for parts of Britain as heavy rain and high winds are expected to hit the country over the next ten days.

The Environment Agency said areas in south-west England, the Midlands and Wales were at risk of flooding despite breaks in the wet weather which could see some parts warmer than Mexico City over the next few days.

The South East may experience temperatures of 
up to 18C (64F) today and tomorrow, five degrees higher than the 
national average for October.

However, recent
 gales and heavy downpours have triggered weather warnings and the 
Environment Agency has issued more than 30 flood alerts for areas in 
Wales, the Midlands and the South West.

In Wales, residents in ten areas have 
been advised to be vigilant amid predictions that the heavy rainfall and
 flash flooding that began over the weekend, is set to continue.

Gareth
 Harvey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press
 Association, said: 'We are expecting heavy rains and gales over the 
next 10 days or so. The weather pattern is very mobile and it is likely 
to stay unsettled.

'Tomorrow
 and Thursday see some drier weather but the rain is likely to be 
relentless, and as there has been quite a lot of rain in recent weeks we
 might start to see some localised flooding.

'There is also a suggestion that it might turn a little colder and drier towards the end of the month.'

Tredegar
 in south Wales saw the heaviest rainfall yesterday, with 40mm, or 
1.6in, falling in the 12 hours to 7pm, Mr Harvey said.

The
 Met Office has issued a number of severe weather warnings for the 
central, Tayside and Fife area, south-west Scotland, Lothian, 
Strathclyde and borders and south-west England as well as Wales.

It
 said the risk of river and surface water flooding was low for south 
west England and south Wales today, and very low tomorrow.

Dan Williams of the Met Office said: 'It looks unsettled into the weekend and indeed into the start of next week as well.

'It looks as though we will see periods of rain and perhaps some drier brighter spells.'

The
 heaviest rain so far this week was in Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, where 
1.4in (35mm) fell in 24 hours.

Natural Resources Wales said it was 
asking people to be vigilant for localised flooding.

The Environment Agency said the wet start to the week would give way to more settled weather by Thursday.

A spokesman said: 'There is a low risk of 
river and surface water flooding today across Devon and Cornwall and a 
low risk of surface water flooding in other parts of south west of 
England.

'On Tuesday there is a low risk of 
river and surface water flooding across much of south west England and 
south Wales as shown in the map below for tomorrow.

'This is as a result of further heavy rain expected through tomorrow.

'The forecast flood risk remains very
 low for all other areas today and tomorrow, and for all of England and 
Wales on Wednesday.'

Warm air flowing across the country from the south west is keeping temperatures hovering above average for this time of year.

However,
 the tepid air has triggered extreme conditions as it moves in, clashing
 with cold air from the north, stirring up squally wind, rain and storms
 that even triggered a tornado.

On
 Sunday, a twister damaged 100 homes, uprooted trees and flipped a 
caravan as it swept across Hayling Island off the Hampshire coast.

And
 a mini tornado ripped roofs off garages and tiles from homes, leaving a
 trail of destruction in its wake in Walsall, West Midlands.

Destruction: Three cars and a house were damaged when the 100-year-old beech tree fell down yesterday

Close-call: Karl Cadwell was sleeping when the tree narrowly missed hitting his bedroom window

Met
 Office spokeswoman Laura Young said: 'You have this warm air going over
 the sea and crashing into colder air over land, combines and produces 
the rain and wind.

'It has 
been slightly warmer than average by one or two degrees. All of our air 
is currently coming up from the south west, so conditions are on the 
warm side for this time of year.

'If
 it was coming from the west conditions would be closer to normal for 
this time of year, or if it was coming from the north west it would be 
slightly cooler.

'The big difference is the overnight temperatures have been much warmer than average and the nights have been quite mild.'

However, the mild nights and close days will soon change as wind directions change toward the end of the week.

Ms Young said: 'Early indications are showing that there will be a return to normal temperatures for this time of year.

'In
 the south, you would usually have temperatures between 12C and 14C for 
the maximum during the day, our if you were in the north you would be 
looking at between 8C and 12C, and further north in Scotland it may be 
closer to 9C or 10C.

'Night-time
 temperatures for this time of year all depend on the conditions, if 
there is cloud cover it will keep it lightly warmer.

It is claimed that the UK gets more tornadoes per square kilometre than the USA but not more tornadoes in total. 

On average, around 30 tornadoes are reported each year in the UK, although these are generally much weaker than their American counterparts. 

However, there have been a number of notable exceptions – such as the Birmingham tornado on July 28 2005, which left a significant trail of damage.

'Night-time
 temperatures this week are anything between 15-16 degrees in the south.
 That continues as a trend until dipping to between 11-13 in the south 
and seven and nine in the north, before warming up again on Thursday.

'But early indicators suggest a return to usual temperatures for this time of year in between five and 10 days time.'

Meanwhile, a family had a lucky escape after a tree toppled over in 50mph storms smashing into their three cars and house.

The 100-year-old tree came crashing down in Bissoe, Cornwall, as parts of Britain were lashed by high winds over the weekend.

Bill Cadwell, 55, heard the 40ft trunk landing on his driveway early on Sunday morning, crushing his son Karl’s Alfa Romeo and badly damaging a Peugeot 208 and a BMW.

It narrowly missed the bedroom windows where Karl, 23 and sister Jody, 27, were sleeping and is now resting against the side of the house.
