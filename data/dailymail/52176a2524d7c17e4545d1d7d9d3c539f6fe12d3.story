Private detectives hired by an insurance company filmed a seven-year-old girl getting undressed on a beach during an investigation of her disabled mother’s compensation claim.

Joanna Hill, a marketing executive and mother-of-four was left in a wheelchair and in constant pain after her leg was crushed in a car accident seven years ago.

Lawyers for Churchill hired a surveillance firm to check whether her injuries were as bad as suggested. The firm, the Cotswold Group, secretly filmed not only her but her friends and children, including when the youngsters were in the grounds of their private school, a Sunday newspaper reported.

On one occasion, her seven-year-old daughter Felicity was filmed changing out of her swimsuit on West Wittering beach, West Sussex, during a family holiday.

The footage was obtained by Mrs Hill and her husband Gavin, 43, an insurance actuary who works in the City, during court disclosure.

The revelations will raise further concerns about practices within the private eye industry.

It has faced scrutiny amid concerns over the so-called ‘blue-chip hacking scandal’ in which it emerged more than 100 companies including law firms and insurers hired private eyes who broke the law. Last week the Daily Mail revealed millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money was being spent on private investigators by councils and other public bodies.

There is no suggestion the Cotswold Group – now G4S Investigation Solutions – have behaved unlawfully. But Mrs Hill, 43, is furious at the use of covert techniques to film her family. She fears tracking devices may have been fitted to the family car to help the investigators follow them.

She told The Sunday Times: ‘We were disgusted when we found out they had filmed the children. The children were upset and for a long time afterwards they were very nervous about changing on the beach. They are still very self-conscious and worried about being followed and filmed. It’s devastating once you know people are snooping.’

The filming prompted a complaint to Royal Bank of Scotland Insurance, the then owner of Churchill. In it the family complained about the ‘appalling and unfair treatment which we have experienced at the hands of RBSI’. Paul Geddes, then chief executive of RBSI, said the company had carried out an investigation and was sorry the couple felt they had been badly treated. But he pointed out that Mrs Hill agreed a settlement – thought to be about £2million.

The Hills said they were forced to settle rather than face the huge costs of taking the case to court for a larger amount of money.

A spokesman for Churchill, now owned by Direct Line, said: ‘In common with other insurers, we occasionally use professional surveillance experts to help with evidence-gathering to test the veracity of claims.

‘Exaggerated or fraudulent claims cost the insurance industry in excess of £1billion in 2012.’

The case is now being examined by civil rights group Liberty. Its director Shami Chakrabarti said:

‘Creepy seaside snooping on children is the risk we run when respect for personal privacy and human dignity goes out the window.’

G4S, which took over Cotswold in 2011, said: ‘As this incident occurred before G4S took control of the company we are not in a position to comment, other than to confirm we are confident all our operatives now follow the highest standards.’
