When it comes to complaining about public transport, Twitter users don't hold back.

The US and Canada's top agencies earn more ire on the social media site than airlines and stir up as much disdain as police departments.

Many services have also more anger directed at them in 140 characters than did the Internal Revenue Service.

William Shatner represented the most positive Twitter luminary and, on the negative end of the scale was Osama bin Laden. The most negative Tweets among the 10 major US public transport agencies studied were for the Washington, D.C. Metro and public transport systems in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago

This is according to a study by the University of Southern California which algorithms to analyse 64,000 comments on Twitter about public transport agencies, as well as police departments, parks and airlines.

Surprisingly, the same algorithm found that William Shatner was more popular than Kim Kardashian on Twitter.

Kardashian and Shatner were used alongside villains as controls on the most positive and negative ends of comments.

The former Star Trek star  represented the most positive Twitter luminary and, on the negative end of the scale was the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

The most negative Twitter commentary among the 10 major public US transport agencies studied was directed at the Washington, D.C. Metro and public transport systems in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago.

A lack of Twitter interaction from the DC Metro saw the rise of the parody Twitter account Unsuck DC Metro, which currently has nearly 29,000 followers

Earning slightly less negative commentary on Twitter — and just ahead of the IRS - were Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.

Vancouver's Translink system fared the best, followed by Portland's TriMet and Toronto's TTC systems, which all had more positive Twitter sentiment on average than the other transport agencies.

Lisa Schweitzer, author of the study, said public transport has an especially acute Internet trolling problem.

The most negative Twitter commentary among the 10 major public transit agencies studied was directed at the Washington, D.C. Metro; Boston (MBTA); Philadelphia (SEPTA) and Chicago (CTA) public transit systems.

Earning slightly less negative commentary on Twitter (and just ahead of the Internal Revenue Service) were Los Angeles (MTA), New York (MTA) and San Francisco (BART).

Vancouver’s Translink system fared the best, followed by Portland’s TriMet and Toronto’s TTC systems, which all had more positive Twitter sentiment on average than the other transit agencies.

'Negative and racist comments about transport patrons are a larger part of the negative comments about transport, much more so than parks, airlines or other services,' Professor Schweitzer said.

'Otherwise, commenters appear on balance to say equally happy and unhappy things about public transit and airline service.' 

Agencies that use Twitter to respond to users' complaints or answer questions get more positive Twitter reaction and more civil discourse online, Professor Schweitzer said. 

'It's about the marketing potential of social media — a lot of public transit agencies are simply tweeting their problems to the world by blasting out late service announcements,' she said.

'That's not a good use of Twitter. 'Agencies don't want to stifle criticism or squash people's concerns because those are valid.

'At the same time, you don't want people walking away from social media thinking transit service is terrible, either, just because people complain.'

The most positively regarded agency of those studied, Vancouver's Translink system, tweets 90 times a day to interact with its patrons.

On the other hand, a lack of Twitter interaction from the DC Metro saw the rise of the parody Twitter account Unsuck DC Metro, which currently has nearly 29,000 followers.
