In an action branded as 'callous' by the RSPCA a bag of dead puppies has been found on the banks of the Burnett River in Queensland.

Brandon McMonigal's day of leisurely fishing was ruined when he happened across the bag of death near Kirby's Wall on Saturday morning.

'The tide came up and dumped the bag on the banks of the river,' he told News Mail. 'I thought it was just rubbish and went to collect the bag. 'I saw the hair and thought it was a rug at first.'

It was only after taking a closer look that Mr McMonigal realised what was actually inside. He was shocked and disgusted at what he saw.

'It's disgusting and feral behaviour,' he said. 'Why would you do something like this?'

Bundaberg Regional Council health and regulatory services spokesman Wayne Honor confirmed its animal control department investigated a report of puppies dumped in the Burnett River. 

'This is an inexcusable act of animal cruelty which was quite distressing for all council staff involved,' he said.

Three weeks ago a person left a female german shepherd dog tied to a tree in bush off the Isis Hwy.

The dead dog was found by a Department of Mains Road worker at 1pm on January 9. RSPCA Queensland spokesman Michael Beatty said nothing had come from the investigation so far and described the latest incident as a 'callous act'.
