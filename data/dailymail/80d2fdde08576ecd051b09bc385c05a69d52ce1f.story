The humpback whale carcass that made headlines around the world when an Australian man became stranded on it after climbing on board has been taken to its final resting place at a garbage landfill.

Council workers at the City of Scarborough in Western Australia have been working since Monday to remove the carcass when it washed up on the beach.

It was a tough job for the workers who took part in the 'massive engineering operation' which ended in a slow one-and-a-half drive to the Tamala Park landfill - in Perth's north - from Scarborough Beach.

A council spokeswoman said the 30-tonne whale was put on the back of a 40-tonne mining truck and was escorted by police to the landfill.

She added it had taken two days to remove the 17-metre carcass from the beach because there were fears it would fall apart.

It is the same whale that Harrison Williams, from Quinns Rocks near Perth, climbed on top of after he jumped off a boat on Saturday afternoon.

He became stranded when sharks started to circle the dead whale.

Looking back on the stunt, Mr Williams told Daily Mail Australia on Sunday that he wanted to help it because it looked like it was in distress but was obviously too late.

Brighton and South Trigg beaches were also closed because sharks were seen circling around the area, wanting to make a meal out of the carcass.

The humpback's mammoth size meant 'specialised equipment' - including two cranes and a Haulpak mining truck - were used to move the whale away from the surf.

Mr Williams said on Sunday he regretted climbing on board and did not realise the danger he was putting himself in.

‘He [the shark] was too busy chomping on the whale so it wasn't too bad,' he said. 

The extreme sports enthusiast added his parents were not impressed with his brush with the whale.

'I’ve done it, I don’t need to do it again,' he said.

‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn't mean any disrespect to anyone. Mum thinks I'm an idiot, and Dad isn't too proud either.'
