A 34-year-old man from Brooklyn has drowned while trying to save his dog from a frozen pond in upstate New York this weekend.

The Ontario County Sheriff's Office says Garvin Anthony Brown and his fiancee were renting a home in the Finger Lakes town of Naples, 40 miles southeast of Rochester.

Deputies say Brown was walking his dog around 1am Sunday when the pooch went onto the ice of a pond and fell into the water.

On thin ice: Brown was walking his dog while vacationing with his fiancee in Naples, New York, when the pooch ran onto a frozen pond along Route 21 

Police say Brown ventured out onto the frozen pond to save his pet, but the thin ice cracked and the 34-year-old fell through. 

Investigators say Brown was unable to get out of the frigid water and drowned. His dog survived the harrowing ordeal. 

The couple were staying at Jim's Adirondack House during their weekend getaway when tragedy struck, reported WROC.

When their dog fell through the ice, Brown ran inside the cabin to alert his fiancee and then returned to the pond to try and rescue the animal.

The woman immediately called 911 to get help, and first responders arrived on the scene along Route 21 in Naples a short time later, but by that time Brown had already drowned.

Responding officers were able to locate the man's body at the bottom of the pond and recover it within an hour.

Brown was pronounced dead at the scene.

Failed rescue: Brown's fiancee called 911 to get help, but by the time emergency responders arrived, it was too late 

Rest in peace: The 34-year-old is survived by his fiancee and a large extended family, many of whom mourned him online Sunday 

The deceased pet owner's body was taken to a nearby hospital for an autopsy to confirm his cause of death.

Brown, a Brooklyn DJ who went by the stage name Tony Trixx, leaves behind a large extended family.

'To all who knew him. My nephew Anthony Garvin Brown gone to soon. Died being a hero,' his uncle Alfie Blackman wrote on his Facebook page.
