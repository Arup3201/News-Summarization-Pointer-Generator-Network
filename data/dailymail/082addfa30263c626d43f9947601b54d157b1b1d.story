The tables were turned on a graffiti artist in Brazil after he was caught red - or in this case, black - handed tagging the side of a police station.

When the unidentified tagger was caught by police, the officer who busted him had something in mind other than arresting him: He forced the vandal to apologize and to allow the officer to spray him in the face with the same black spray-paint he used to tag the police barracks.

The entire thing was videotaped and uploaded to the website Live Leak earlier this week.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Tagger: This young man was busted spray-painting the police station near Sao Paulo, Brazil

Alternative: Rather than arrest the young man, the officer who busted him offered him an alternative

Apologize: The officer told the tagger he wouldn't arrest him if he apologized and allowed him to spray-paint the young man's face

The video shows the tagger on his knees as the officer lectures him in Portuguese.

The sound of the officer shaking the can of spray-paint is heard before he sprays it on the young man's face for about 15 seconds, covering his entire face and head.

The tagger then coughs from the fumes before he is forced by the officer to apologize.

'Say sorry,' the officer snaps at the tagger.

Thorough: The officer sprays the tagger's face for about 15 seconds, nearly covering his entire face

He's sorry: After having his face covered with spray paint, the tagger apologized for vandalizing the police barracks

Lesson learned: The officer then tells the tagger to leave before he changes his mind about arresting him

'Sorry, sir, I will never paint the base of police again,' the tagger responds.

'Now get out before I change my idea,' the offiser says.

The young vandal then gets to his feet and runs off.

The video already has been viewed nearly 125,000 times since it was posted two days ago.

Brazilian authorities apparently take graffiti very seriously - anyone caught tagging a building in the South American country can face a fine and up to a year in jail.
