David Cameron’s former ‘back-to-work tsar’ Emma Harrison last night claimed she was ‘bullied’ out of her job following embarrassing revelations that she had paid herself £8.6 million.

In an emotional interview Mrs Harrison said she had been unfairly caught up in a ‘political maelstrom’, forcing her to quit her roles as a Downing Street adviser and as chairman of controversial welfare-to-work firm A4e.

She did not criticise Mr Cameron directly. But, appearing close to tears, she said: ‘I am a useful face for the political people to have a go at.’

Her comments came as leaked figures suggested A4e received £46 million from the taxpayer last year for its work on the Government’s flagship Work Programme - despite finding long-terms jobs for fewer than four per cent of its unemployed ‘clients’.

Figures passed to Channel Four News revealed that just 3,400 of the 94,000 jobseekers referred to A4e were found a job lasting six months or more during the first year of the Government’s flagship Work Programme.

Despite this, the firm was paid £45.9 million for its work on the scheme, which ministers hope will get the long-term jobless back to work and drive down unemployment.

On average, each job cost the taxpayer £13,500. The figures - which were disputed by the company - will spark fresh concerns about whether the £5 billion Work Programme can deliver value for money to the taxpayer and cut unemployment.

Ministers have argued that the terms of the ‘payment-by-results’ scheme mean that firms will not profit unless they find jobs for significant numbers of unemployed people.

But firms like A4e, one of five main contractors, receive a ‘referral fee’ of at least £400 for each jobseeker they take on.

Jobseekers considered harder to place attract a fee of £600. A4e then receives £1,200 if a client is placed in a job for six months, with further payments to follow for up to 20 months.

The leaked figures suggest A4e’s success rate during the first year of the programme was just 3.65 per cent - well below even the Government’s minimum threshold of 5.5 per cent.

Mrs Harrison last night said the figures were ‘all wrong’, but declined to say what the true position is.

She said the statistics were part of an ongoing attempt to discredit the operation of the Work Programme.

She added: 'I was bullied out of a job that I had been doing for 25 years.

'My staff have been bullied. And do you know what’s worse? Because of the reporting you did my children have been bullied.'

She added: 'It’s time this bullying stopped. Bullying entrepreneurs like me, someone like me who has invested tens of millions and employed thousands of people, it’s not good for the UK.'

'We were caught in this political maelstrom. I am a useful face for the politics people to have a go at.

'I am not a politician, I am not a civil servant, I am not experienced in this stuff. But I was really useful to have a go at. And they used me and my organisation and I stepped down as the chairman, which is still incredibly upsetting as it’s something I loved doing.

'When I meet people in the street and they say "Oh, I recognise you, your lot got me that job. I’m now working at Marks & Spencer, it’s transformed my life", I bloody love the work I do.'

A4e also disputed the figures, which it said it ‘did not recognise’.

Mrs Harrison said A4e was a ‘wonderful company’, and insisted she had invested £50 million in building it up.

And she struggled to control her emotions as she discussed her spectacular downfall earlier this year.

Mrs Harrison quit as the Prime Minister’s adviser two weeks after the Daily Mail revealed she had paid herself an astonishing dividend of £8.6 million, most of it relating to public sector contracts. The following day she quit as the company’s chairman, although she still controls 85 per cent of the firm’s shares.

The firm also faced a string of allegations of fraud, although it was later largely cleared of serious abuse by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Mrs Harrison said she had been ‘bullied out of a job I loved’ and remained ‘incredibly upset’ about what had happened. She said the firm’s staff, and even her own children, had also been bullied.

She went on: ‘Bullying entrepreneurs is not good for the UK.’ In a statement last night A4e said the leaked figures were ‘out of date’, adding that the ‘data does not give a full or accurate picture of Work Programme performance’.

The company pointed out that the Work Programme is only 18 months into a five-year scheme.

The DWP is expected to publish its own initial figures next month, but has cautioned it is too early to judge the final outcome of the scheme.
