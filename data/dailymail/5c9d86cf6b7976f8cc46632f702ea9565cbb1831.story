Luka Magnotta, the suspected cannibal killer, poses happily with two of the big screen's most infamous monsters... just a few years before he took his own place in the annals of real crime.

Magnotta smiles as Mike Myers and Freddie Kruger take a swipe as his neck in a pitcure from a visit to a Florida theme park in 2007.

While they are the stuff of the darkest parts of our imagination, it is alleged that Magnotta went on to 
perform his sick fantasies for real.

The only question now is: how many 
times?

Which one's the real monster? Luka Magnotta, the suspect in the Canadian cannibal case, stands flanked by actors portraying horror characters Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers on Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, in 2007

Today it emerged that Magnotta has 
been linked to a second killing, in which a severed head, hands and feet
were left beneath the iconic Hollywood sign.

Parts of retired airline worker Hervey
Medellin, 66, were discovered at the landmark in Los Angeles, 
California, in January - when Magnotta is thought to have been in the 
city.

Police in LA are now said to be 
investigating if Magnotta was behind the killing, which has echoes of 
his alleged brutal slaying of 33-year-old Chinese student Jun Lin.

Another victim? Hervey Medellin's severed head was discovered beneath the Hollywood sign in January, when Magnotta was reportedly in the city

Magnotta, 29, a bisexual prostitute 
who had plastic surgery to look like James Dean, was arrested in Germany
on Monday as he viewed naked photographs of himself in an internet 
cafe.

The Sun claims his Hollywood pimp - 
named only as Alex - told them the Canadian was working as a rent boy in
Los Angeles at the time Mr Medellin's body was murdered.

Soon after the gay retiree's remains 
were discovered, Magnotta was reportedly using a Facebook page to offer 
'massages' to male clients at a flat in the city.

In another grisly twist to the case, 
police investigating the disappearance of Mr Lin said yesterday that two
of student's missing body parts – a right hand and a right foot – had been 
recovered.

They were posted to a primary school 
and a private boys’ school in Vancouver from Montreal, the city in which
officers suspect Mr Lin was murdered by Magnotta.

Police said staff at False Creek Elementary School opened a package containing a hand on Tuesday afternoon.

Taunting: Luka Rocco Magnotta posted three videos while on the run from authorities on a YouTube page that has since been taken down

Smoke: Magnotta puffs on a cigarette and poses 
to camera in one of the chilling videos. He was arrested on Monday at an
internet cafe in Berlin

Another containing a foot was 
discovered at St George’s private school for boys later in the day. 
Officers said the packages did not appear to have been intended for any 
specific pupil or member of staff.

Disturbing: This new photo of Luka Rocco Magnotta, the man accused of hacking his gay lover to pieces, shows the Canadian porn actor looking menacing with a switch blade

Montreal police commander Ian 
Lafreniere said DNA tests would be conducted to confirm the body parts 
belonged to Mr Lin, but added: ‘They were the same limbs we were looking
for. They also were shipped from Montreal, where the killing occurred.’

It also emerged last night that 
Magnotta - who has been dubbed the 'Canadian cannibal' apparently 
couldn’t resist taunting authorities while on the run, and left an 
enormous online footprint of videos and Facebook posts.

The brazen videos – which authorities 
believe were posted last Saturday through Monday, prior to his arrest in
Berlin – feature the low-budget gay porn star smoking and saying hello 
to ‘all my fans.’

He used different music in all three 
videos, including New Order’s True Faith. That track was also used in 
the grisly video Magnotta posted depicting him torturing and 
dismembering Mr Lin.

The three videos were posted under the YouTube moniker ibechillin69, which has since been closed.

Montreal police Cmdr. Denis Mainville confirmed to newspaper La Presse that the videos are indeed recent.

He said: ‘We must check the clothing, 
the physical aspects. The French police will give us a hand, adding: ‘It
would be very surprising if it was filmed before the murder.’

Trans-national: Pieces of Jun Lin were discovered more than 2,800 miles apart after Magnotta dropped his lover's dismembered limbs in the post

Poser: Another image posted online by Magnotta reading 'I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way'

The songs – Madonna’s La Isla Bonita, 
The Great Commandment by German band Camouflage, and New Order’s True 
Faith – were all released in 1987, thestar.com noted.

However, police have not yet found the significance of those songs, nor why Magnotta, who was born in 1982, chose them.

Investigators have already disclosed 
that Magnotta put a video on the internet of himself not only killing 
and dismembering his victim in his flat but also eating parts of the 
body.

A police car arrived at Moabit jail this morning, believed to be carrying Magnotta who is to be brought before a judge in Berlin

Grisly: A packaged containing a human hand was 
opened by staff at False Creek Elementary School, right, on Tuesday 
while another package containing a human foot was found by staff at St. 
George's private school for boys, left, later in the day

Investigation: The British Columbia Coroner's Service and the Vancouver police's major crime investigators have been called in

Spotted: Interpol launched a hunt for Magnotta last Tuesday after a headless torso was found behind Magnotta's flat in Montreal and a hand and foot were posted to political parties in Ottawa

Targeted? Police said there is no indication any student or staff has been targeted at either school

Following an international manhunt, 
the actor was arrested in Berlin on Monday after evading police for days
while he partied in Paris.

He was searching for online reports 
about the case and looking at naked pictures of himself when he was 
recognised by a member of staff in an internet cafe. He has told German 
officials he will not fight extradition to Canada.

The crime came to light last week when
body parts – now proven to be those of Mr Lin – were posted to the 
headquarters of Canada’s Liberal and Conservative parties.

A torso was found in a suitcase on a rubbish dump outside Magnotta’s apartment building, but the victim’s head remains missing.

International: Magnotta could be returned to Canada as early as this week, according to authorities

Murdered: Jun Lin was a Chinese exchange student in Montreal, who once dated Magnotta. A video shows him being horribly mutilated and partially eaten

Spotted: Magnotta was identified in an internet cafe in Berlin, allegedly searching for images of himself

Caught: An employee at the Spatkauf Internet-Cafe recognized Magnotta and called police. When German officials entered the premises, he did not resist

A copy of what police believe is a 
video of the killing shows a man hitting his naked and bound victim 
repeatedly with an icepick.

He then cuts up the body, performs sexual acts on it and feeds parts to pets.

Police are trying to remove the ten-minute video from the internet but it has already been viewed nearly two million times.

Entitled ‘one lunatic, one icepick’ and set to music by British band New Order, it shows the killer using a fork and knife.

Police suggested they had a longer 
version of the film which reveals him eating parts of  the body. 
Commander Lafreniere said: ‘As gross and as graphic as it could be, yes,
it was seen on the video. We’re keeping some details for ourselves.’

Jailed: The central police detention facility of Berlin where Luka Rocco Magnotta is being held in Berlin, Germany

Multiples: Police said he has 70 Facebook accounts under different names

Officers believe Magnotta flew to 
Paris soon after allegedly murdering Mr Lin on May 24. He chose the 
French capital because he knew people there from an earlier visit, they 
said.

He arrived in Berlin on Saturday by 
bus from Paris, staying for two nights with a friend he met on the 
internet before he was captured, German prosecutors said.

There has yet to be any explanation for why the school packages came to light only this week.

Alias: Magnotta, pictured at right at age 6, was said to use the name Eric Newman. Police said he may dress as a woman to avoid capture and released a sketch, left, during their manhunt

Concern: Parents were distraught by the news of the suspicious package

Hunt: Police said the body they found of Mr Lin was still missing a head, hand and foot, but would not immediately confirm if the found appendages were his

Post: Police said Magnotta mailed other body parts to political parties in Canada

According to investigators, Magnotta 
was born in Scarborough, Ontario, later changing his name from the less 
exotic-sounding Eric Newman.

An avid player of computer games, he 
has 70 Facebook accounts under different names and also used the alias 
Vladimir Romanov. Police say he worked as a rent boy under the name 
Angel.

He posted numerous images of himself 
online including one posing with a knife and another with the message – 
borrowed from the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit? – ‘I’m not bad, I’m just
drawn that way’.

Montreal police said they would review hundreds of murder cases for possible links to Magnotta.

In a blog post, the LA Times reported 
information from anonymous sources denying that investigators had linked
Magnotta to the Hollywood killing.

Sources familiar with the 
investigation said Magnotta had not visited the U.S. in two years and 
that the bizarre nature of the victim's mutilation was the only thing 
that linked the cases.
