A three-year-old boy is able to walk for the first time thanks to scientists who made him a bespoke body suit.

Brandon Conway was left with limited movement in his left side after suffering a stroke shortly after he was born.

He suffers from poor vision and epilepsy and doctors feared he would struggle to walk or even crawl.

Brandon Conway, with parents Andy Conway and Melanie Davies, was not expected to be able to walk because he suffered a stroke as a baby

Lycra dynamic splinting is a form of support, made from a strong type of lycra, that benefits people with many neurological conditions including strokes and cerebral palsy.

The splints are individually designed to fit all, or part of, the body.

They can improve tone, posture and muscle control by supporting the body in a healthy position and by stimulating weak muscles.

But he can now lead a normal life thanks to the £500 suit which supports his muscles.

His mother Melanie Davies, 24, said: 'When he took his first steps, I was in tears. We were on holiday in the Isle of Portland in the English Channel, and he was tottering around the cottage.

'He would let go of one bit of furniture
and go over to the next bit. It was amazing.'

Ms Davies and her partner Andy Conway, from Portsmouth, realised that Brandon was unwell when, as a baby, he stopped using his left side and taking milk properly.

He was rushed to hospital where a brain scan showed that he had had a stroke.

Since then he has been epileptic, has had poor vision, and has suffered from muscle weakness down the left side of his body.

However, his life turned around when staff at The Alexandra pub in Portsmouth offered to help raise money for him to have a specially made Dynamic Lycra Splint.

Brandon's suit helps him by keeping his hips and back straight. It also stabilises his body and keeps his posture balanced so he can move more normally.

Ms Davies said: 'It's very tight fitting and pulls his muscles in the correct directions.'

The NHS now replaces it every time he grows out of it.

The stroke left the three-year-old with weakness in his left side, epilepsy and poor vision

Brandon has now been fitted with a Lycra Dynamic Splint which supports his muscles and improves his posture so that he can walk

Ms Davies said: 'He's growing quickly and goes through about four suits a year.

'When
he got the suit we knew he would walk, but we didn't know when it would
happen and how soon. It felt like we were waiting forever.'

'Where the stroke affects one side of his body he's very lopsided and his spine had started to bend a bit.

'The lycra suit straightens up his spine and his hip and stimulates the muscles in his left arm as well.

'We are absolutely thrilled that he's walking and he can't wait to run now.'

Dynamic Lycra Splints are a relatively new way to help those who have suffered a stroke.

Brandon's mother Melanie Davies, 24, said: 'When he took his first steps, I was in tears. It was amazing'

They have to be made to measure to achieve a snug fit and increase pressure on the muscles that need support.

Talking about Brandon's condition, Huw Jones, neo-natologist consultant at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, said: 'In my first ten years of working in Portsmouth I have seen three cases of strokes in babies.

'It occurs in one in every 2,500 to 5,000 births, not all are diagnosed early on and some would be clinically sound.

'The key difference with infants is they have a better chance of recovery than adults.'
