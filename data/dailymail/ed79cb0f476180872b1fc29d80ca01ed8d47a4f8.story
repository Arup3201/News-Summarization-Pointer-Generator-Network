The Rose of Tralee is one of Ireland's  longest running festivals.

But the beauty pageant, which attracts entrants from as far flung as Dubai and Australia has also long been considered 'twee' and outdated by its critics over on the Emerald Isle. 

So the news this weekend that the event's latest winner, Boston-born Maria Walsh, 27, is gay has caused shock waves across Ireland.

Maria Walsh, 27, was crowned Rose Of Tralee at the competition in County Kerry last Tuesday 

Maria, who was raised in County Mayo for 20 years, made the revelation in the Irish Sun On Sunday yesterday and the resulting outpouring of affection from thousands of well-wishers has been enormous. 

Many are even predicting the announcement will give the Rose Of Tralee pageant a much-needed push into the 21st century. 

The studio manager, who has already flown back to her current home in Philadelphia took the courageous decision to make her sexuality public in order to help other people in the same situation. 

She told the newspaper: 'My family and friends have been extremely supportive, my parents were very much about ensuring that their children are healthy and happy.

Maria Walsh, 27, newly-crowned Rose of Tralee announced that she is a lesbian at the weekend 

'I'm not ashamed of my sexuality by any means.

'The Rose of Tralee is about celebrating women's intelligence, careers, their volunteer work, the question of sexuality just never came up.

'To me, being gay is normal; it's natural.'

The reception to Maria's interview was overwhelmingly positive, with Twitter lighting up with remarks about her inspirational decision. 

Maria's decision to speak out about her sexuality caused a barrage of positive comments on social networking sites like Twitter 

 

After the announcement yesterday morning, Maria donned a green jersey and headed down to cheer on her Mayo football team at the KerryMayo All Ireland football semi- final in Croke Park, where she was given a hero's welcome. 

The host of the Rose of Tralee, DÁithÍ Ó Sé has also now spoken out in support of Maria's announcement. 

He said: 'For me it doesn't matter what god you pray to, what colour your skin is or what your sexuality is - I think it's absolutely fantastic.

'All these people who have been saying for years that [the Rose of Tralee] is twee, it's back in the Fifties, well, I would love to see what they have to say this morning. 

'It just shows that the Rose of Tralee is very current and it is moving along with the times.'

The TV presenter said that the topic of her sexuality had just never come up during the competition rounds.

He said: You ask some of them if they have boyfriends, you don't ask others, it depends on what time you have and what stuff you have to talk about.  

Ms Walsh plans to work with teen suicide prevention charity, the Donal Walsh Live Life Foundation, during her year as the Rose of Tralee. 

She said: 'Being gay and in a gay relationship is just one of many things I identify and associate with. If this can help any person to feel more comfortable with who they are then I'm happy.'
