Fraudster: Colin Jarvie conned his wife, his employers, customers and insurance companies out of £92,000

An unsuspecting bride was scammed out of more than £50,000 by her conman husband - who even pawned her diamond wedding ring.

Mechanical engineer Colin Jarvie, 38, spent four years stealing from new wife Letizia Salaris to fund his taste in expensive cars.

He was jailed for 27 months yesterday after admitting seven charges of fraud and one of theft in what a judge branded 'a catalogue of dishonesty'.

Gloucester Crown court heard Letizia became a victim of Jarvie from the moment they were married, after meeting him on an online dating site.

He ducked out of their Far East honeymoon by saying he was ill and had to go to hospital.

In fact he had paid for the wedding and honeymoon with his employers' credit card - and soon afterwards he started stealing from Letizia to help fund his taste for expensive cars and clothes.

The court heard he took her £8,200 engagement ring 'to be cleaned' - but then pawned it for £2,000 before claiming to his insurers that it was lost and getting an £8,000 payout.

For almost four years, Jarvie also stole the £1,000 his new wife paid him each month towards their mortgage. In total she lost £50,400 to the fraudster.

Prosecutor Julian Kesner said: 'When she first started going out with him in 2005 she was not the only woman in his life. But they did settle down and they arranged to go on honeymoon which he paid for with the company credit card. The defendant paid for the wedding through the same company card.

'Immediately after the wedding, before they went on honeymoon, he said that he couldn't go because he had to go into hospital and as a consequence of that he didn't go home with her after the wedding.

'Nor could she arrange, although she wanted to, to go and visit him in hospital and she didn't actually see him there. His excuse was that he kept changing wards and doctors so she didn't see him.

'They bought a house together in Crawley [West Sussex] and agreed to settle the mortgage speedily by each paying £1,000 a month, a significant overpayment. He paid only the £600 interest on the mortgage.'

Mr Kesner added: 'In August 2012 he asked to borrow £2,000 from her. She didn't agree but he took the money in any event. He was desperate for money.

'Also in August 2012 he asked her for her engagement ring, a diamond ring of some value. He said "I want to get it cleaned" and she gave over the ring but it was the last she saw of it. He pawned it for £2,000.

'Not only did Jarvie get an £8,000 payout from Aviva for the ring - he also tried to claim the loss on another policy with Direct Line but they turned him down.'

'No greater breach of trust can be imagined than a husband stealing from his wife.'

Judge Jamie Tabor QC

Jarvie, originally from Motherwell, Lanarkshire but now of Chelmsford, Essex, also duped his employers, customers, insurance companies and a Cash Convertors shop during a campaign of fraud, the court heard.

Sentencing Jarvie yesterday, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told him the most serious offences were those against his bride.

He said: 'There you are, embarking on your marriage, and on the day of your honeymoon you conned your wife by saying you were not well enough to go.

'You spun her a yarn about being moved from hospital to hospital so she could not come and see you. Then you started stealing from her, That is unforgiveable.

'No greater breach of trust can be imagined than a husband stealing from his wife.

'Then, to cap it all, you take her engagement ring, saying you are going to get it cleaned, and you take it off to the pawnbroker and get £2,000 for it.

'Then comes the icing on the cake - you tell your insurers Aviva you have lost it and they pay you £8,000.'

Prosecutor
 Julian Kesner said Jarvie was a highly regarded employee at Socomec, a company 
dealing in thermal imaging and disaster rescue equipment in Cirencester,
 Gloucestershire.

As well as a company car he had business credit cards, phones, a computer and other 'signficant' perks, said the prosecutor.

The company had no problems with him until 2012, but then they discovered he had spent £5,000 on personal items on his business credit card. They made an arrangement for them to repay him at £50 a week but he Jarvie kept failing to keep monthly appointments.

Anomalies were then found in his expenses. As well as cheating the company out of a total of £24,000 - including another £7,900 on his credit card. He had also duped a customer, by selling him goods for £8,500 which he never received.

He 
abandoned his company car, an Audi A3, and drove around instead in 
luxury vehicles including a Range Rover and an Audi RS4 sports car, the court heard.

He had bought the Audi on credit and a county court judgement for £16,000 was made against him for defaulting on the payments.

After showdown talks with bosses, Jarvie then went to a Cash Convertors store and sold some company equipment, the court heard.

Mr Kesner said the total losses suffered by all Jarvie's victims was £92,000.

Joe Maloney, defending, said Jarvie accepted his offences were 'dreadful' but he had started to make amends by signing over his £34,000 pension fund to his wife and also his £8,000 share of the equity in the house.

He said Jarvie also suffered from an excess of iron and had to have a pint of blood removed from him every week.
