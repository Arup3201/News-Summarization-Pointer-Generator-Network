When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. 

Rather than letting the weather rain on his parade, a defiant driver with broken wipers has decided to take the impaired visibility he faced during a  storm into his own hands.

The dash cam video, which surfaced on Facebook on Thursday, begins on a busy highway surrounded by bushland during a heavy rain storm.

The dash cam video, which surfaced on Facebook on Thursday, has received over 250,000 Views and 4000 shares on Facebook

An old fashioned red sedan can be seen driving several cars ahead, which apparently has broken wipers. As the driver with the dash cam approaches, he says: ‘Go the squeegee.’

The driver of the sedan can then be seen reaching out the window with a hand held squeegee and wiping the windshield.

It’s unknown where the video was filmed or when, but it has received over 250,000 Views and 4000 shares on Facebook.
