A Newcastle man got the shock of his life while he was filming a lightning storm  in New South Wales.

Rob McGee was watching the storm roll over the city - two hours north of Sydney - when he captured the moment a lightning strike hit a nearby gym.

Mr McGee posted the video on social media just after 7.30pm on Sunday.

'Scared the crap out of me!' he wrote along with the video.

In the five-second footage, a deafening crack is heard when lightning hits a building.

Mr McGee told shocked friends who commented on the post that the landing place was a gym behind Civic train station. 

'Had a better look..... it is gym behind the station. Bet a few people dropped a weight or two,' he wrote.

The storm that rolled in over NSW on Sunday followed hot weather during the day

He added 'a few' others had hit his building but this was the only one he had captured on camera.

At the time of publication, Mr McGees' video had attracted almost 70,000 views on social media. 

Sunday's hot weather during the day was followed by thunderstorms late in the afternoon.

In NSW, a number of fires were believed to have been started by lightning strikes.

At least 90 blazes were burning across the state, with more than half deemed out-of-control.

Most were caused by lightning strikes late Sunday that followed scorching temperatures in Sydney and around the state, NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman Ben Shepherd said.

'The good thing at this stage is there is nothing impacting on any lives or property,' he told AAP on Monday.

'However, given the remoteness of some of these fires, it is going to take a considerable effort over coming days in order to actually start some containment on a number of these fires.'

Mr Shepherd said the RFS had sent out planes on Monday morning to try to detect new outbreaks.

'We are expecting more [fires],' he said.

About 430 firefighters were on the ground and more are on standby.

'We've probably got a day or two at least of more favourable weather, which will assist in getting some of these fires under control,' Mr Shepherd said.

Sydney was set to reach a top of 30 degrees Celsius on Monday while Wallsend, in the Hunter region, was expected to peak at 38, and Penrith in Sydney's west had a maximum of 36. 

Total fire bans remain in place for the lower central west plains, including Dubbo.
