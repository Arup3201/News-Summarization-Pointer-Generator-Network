'Critical': Marussia test driver Maria De Villota has lost an eye in the wake of her horrific crash at Duxford Airfield

The female Formula One driver who survived a horrific head-on crash at a British airfield has lost her right eye in the wake of the accident, it was revealed today.

Marussia test driver Maria De Villota is described as being in a 'critical but 
stable' condition after undergoing considerable overnight surgery at 
Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

Team principal John Booth said: 'Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident.

'We are grateful for the medical 
attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to 
thank the neurological and plastics surgical teams.

'However, it is with great sadness I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye.'

De Villota, who joined Marussia as 
test driver in March, was taking part in her first test for the team, a 
straight-line aero at the old Second World War site.

The 32-year-old Spaniard had just 
completed her initial installation run when her car ran into the 
tailgate of a support truck at around 20-30mph, which was at such a 
height to inflict the head trauma.

Initially her injuries were described
 as 'life-threatening' by an ambulance service spokesman, only for more 
encouraging statements to follow later on as De Villota was reported to 
be conscious.

Marussia have now confirmed, however, surgery began yesterday afternoon, with De Villota in theatre until this morning.

Booth added: 'Maria's care and the 
wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are
 at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them.

'We ask for everyone's patience and understanding with regard to updates on Maria's condition.

What happened? Maria de Villota slows her Marussia MR01 down as she approaches the team's makeshift pit area

Problem: Seconds later the car takes off, avoids a crowd of mechanics and crashes into her team's lorry

Horrific: The car was wedged under the lorry's loading bay. Miss de Villota suffered head injuries

'We will provide further information when it is appropriate to do so and with consideration for her family.

'In the meantime, we would all like to take this opportunity to praise the emergency services at Duxford Airfield, who were on stand-by yesterday, as is usual procedure for a Formula One test.

'Finally, we have been overwhelmed by messages of support for Maria, her family and the team and we would like to express our sincere gratitude for those.'

Early theories behind the accident have suggested the anti-stall mechanism on the car kicked in as she approached a makeshift pit area, suddenly propelling her into the truck.

Booth has confirmed investigations into the accident are ongoing, adding: 'We have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.'

Witnesses said De Villota's helmet and the front of her Marussia MR01 car took the bulk of the impact.

Her injuries were originally feared to
 be life threatening but Miss de Villota is now in a stable condition in
 hospital and has been able to speak to her family on the phone.

The crash happened yesterday morning 
at Duxford Aerodrome in Cambridgeshire, which is home to the Imperial 
War Museum's aircraft collection.

Doubts
 have been raised about the MR01 model which had to have corrective work
 after it failed a safety test in February. Yesterday was the first time
 Miss de Villota had tried it out.

Something seemed amiss with the car 
before it hit the lorry, according to Chris Mann, a BBC Radio 
Cambridgeshire presenter who witnessed the accident.

Racing in the blood: De Villota is the daughter of former Formula One driver Emilio De Villota

The 32-year-old Spaniard was taken to Addenbrooke's hospital

Marussia's race regulars are German driver Timo Glock (above), who missed the last Grand Prix in Valencia through illness, and Frenchman Charles Pic

'She got into the car, fired it up and did a test run at probably about 200mph in the rain,' he said.

'The
 car was slightly misfiring but there didn't seem to be any concerns.

'She came back into the area we were in with the engineers. She slowed 
down but then suddenly, inexplicably, accelerated through the crowd and 
smashed into the side of the truck.'

Mr Mann's son, Nick, said it was a miracle none of the Marussia mechanics near the lorry was mown down.

De Villota was given a test drive by Renault in August last year when she clocked up just under 200 miles

Miss
 de Villota, whose father Emilio was a F1 driver in the 1980s, was 
scheduled to spend two days doing straight-line tests on Duxford's 
1,312-yard runway.

She was pulling in for mechanics to inspect the car 
in the makeshift pit area when it took off and crashed at around 40mph.

It has been suggested that the anti-stall mechanism on her car kicked in and propelled her forward.

'There
 was a sort of board down, like a loading board, and the car went 
careering into the side of that,' Mr Mann said.

'The top of her car and 
her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it.'

Miss de Villota remained motionless for around 15 minutes while paramedics treated her.

She
 was seen to move her hands before being transported by air ambulance to
 Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge with serious head and facial 
injuries.

F1 drivers spoke of their shock at hearing news of the crash.

Jenson
 Button wrote on Twitter: 'Terrible accident for Maria de Villota, 
Marussia F1 team test driver.

'My thoughts are with Maria and her 
family.'

Spain's Fernando Alonso said: 'We called the family and hopefully we will know more soon. All my energy with you!'

After racing in Spanish F3, the Daytona 24 Hours, the Euroseries 3000 and Superleague Formula Championship, Miss de Villota was appointed test driver of Marussia in March. Test drivers help the team develop cars without taking part in races.

Since Miss de Villota's appointment another woman, Britain's Suzie Wolff, has been given a similar role at rivals Williams.

Russian-owned Marussia, which is based in Banbury, Oxfordshire, has taken over the Virgin Racing team of Sir Richard Branson. Last night a spokesman said: 'Maria is conscious and medical assessments are ongoing.'

Discussing how she compares to male 
drivers, Miss de Villota has said: 'While I have great respect for them,
 I do not see an uneven playing field.

'Physically I have to work harder,
 but as an athlete and a driver I feel that with proper training and 
with the experience that I need, I think I can do it very well.'

Her brother Emilio Jr is also a racing driver.
