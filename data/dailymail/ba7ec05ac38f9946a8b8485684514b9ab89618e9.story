Teddy Sheringham has emerged as a shock contender for the role of forwards coach at West Ham.

Sam Allardyce has been told to introduce a more attacking brand of football if he wants to remain as manager, with the recruitment of a more offensive coach part of the deal.

And Sportsmail understands that Sheringham, the 48-year-old former Manchester United and England striker who spent three years at Upton Park towards the end of his career, has been approached about the position.

Hammer time: teddy Sheringham is set to rejoin West Ham, the club he played for between 2004 and 2007, as Sam Allardyce's new attacking coach

East End hero: Sheringham was part of Alan Pardew's team who celebrated promotion to the Premier League in 2005 after winning the Championship play-off final

After 288 goals in 755 league appearances, Sheringham finally retired from playing in 2008 following a spell at Colchester United.

But he has been studying for his coaching badges since then and is now ready to take a job in coaching. Les Ferdinand has also been linked with the job but the role is certainly one Sheringham would entertain taking.

Under orders: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has been instructed by the club's board to improve the attacking flair of the team that finished last season in 13th place

Leading the line: Should Sheringham take the role, he'll be working with England forward Andy Carroll (pictured alongside Mark Noble) at Upton Park
