 IN HAMILTON, ONTARIO

She is an icon of the skies – one of the most famous and recognisable aircraft in the world – and now she’s coming home.

Tomorrow Vera, a legendary Avro Lancaster Mk X bomber, will begin an epic 3,700-mile journey from her base in Canada en route to England.

Here she will be reunited with the only other airworthy Lancaster, operated by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, part of the RAF, and for the very first time, and probably the only time, they will fly together.

Giant of the skies: Avro Lancaster VR-A flying over the plains of Hamilton, Ontario, last week

Voyage: The legendary bomber will fly from Canada to England, with stops in Newfoundland and Iceland

Vera, so-called because of her registration VR-A, will then embark on a tour to delight crowds at air shows across  the country.

Leon Evans, chief pilot for the Canadian Lancaster’s historic trip, says: ‘It’s a thrill and an honour to be doing this. I’m sure it’ll be very emotional for everyone.’

It will certainly be emotional for aircraft enthusiast Matthew Munson, from Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.

The 34-year-old will be a passenger on Vera’s transatlantic flight after bidding £43,000 on auction website eBay for the privilege.

One lucky Mail on Sunday reader could also grab this once-in-a-lifetime chance – and if that’s you, unlike Matthew you’ll fly in the Lancaster for free.

Today we are offering a fantastic prize of a flight in this historic aircraft, along with an overnight stay to help you prepare for it. See the panel below for details and how to enter.

Before Vera, whose last visit to Britain was in 1959, left her base at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario, I was offered the chance to take a 30-minute test flight with her crew.

War hero: The Lancaster is named after Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski, who was awarded a posthumous VC

The sound hits you first: the distinctive, deep-throated growl of its four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

At a length of just over 69ft and with a wingspan of 102ft, the bomber dwarfed me as I stood next to her, but inside, it’s surprising how tight the space actually is – about 6ft feet across and 5ft high.

As I stand in the cockpit at 2,500ft, it’s  impossible not to be moved by my surroundings, nor to marvel at the bravery of the men who crewed this magnificent aircraft during the war.

The Lancaster was built in Toronto in 1945 and served as a search and rescue aircraft. It is dedicated to the memory of Royal Canadian Air Force Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski, and is known as the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster.

It is painted in the colours of his wartime Lancaster KB726 VR-A, which flew in raids with 419 (Moose) Squadron.

Mynarski was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after his aircraft was shot down over France in 1944. As the blazing aircraft plummeted, he attempted to free the trapped tail gunner.

Mynarski survived the crash but later died from severe burns. Miraculously,  the gunner lived to tell his story.

Vera’s journey will take four days, involving stops in Newfoundland and  Iceland before arriving at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire on Friday.

Dream trip: Matthew Munson paid £43,000 to fly in the Lancaster - you can do it for free

Durham Tees Valley is a fitting start and end point for the flight:  it was once Middleton St George RAF base, the northernmost bomber station during the war.

The Mail on Sunday has teamed up with Thwaites, brewer of Lancaster Bomber ale – sponsor of the Lancaster’s landmark tour around Britain – to offer this fantastic prize.

You can buy Lancaster Bomber ale, twice voted Best English Bitter, in stores, including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose, Booths and Ocado.
