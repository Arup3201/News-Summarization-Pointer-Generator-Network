The collapse in value of Facebook shares after the company's disastrous flotation on the stock market might be a sign of worse things to come.

One senior investment analyst predicts that the firm will collapse in value and will virtually disappear within eight years.

Eric Jackson of investment firm Ironfire Capital predicts that Facebook will collapse like ex-internet titans such as Yahoo, as it struggles to keep up with younger, leaner firms.

Speaking to the CNBC show Squawk on the Street, he said that Facebook would struggle with the 'modern', mobile web, and would disappear.

‘In five to eight years they are going to disappear in the way that Yahoo has disappeared. Yahoo is still making money, it’s still profitable, still has 13,000 employees working for it, but it’s 10 percent of the value that it was at the height of 2000. For all intents and purposes, it’s disappeared,’ said Jackson.

The key to the impending disaster that Jackson predicts for the social networks is that it's falling between 'generations' of technology - and will struggle with moving into mobiles.

Facebook has aggressively targeted mobile users with a range of new apps, but has struggled to make apps profitable without making advertising too intrusive.

Jackson divides companies into three generations - web portals, such as Yahoo, social sites such as Facebook, and mobile companies, such as today's hot app start-ups.

‘When you look over these three generations, no matter how successful you are in one generation, you don’t seem to be able to translate that into success in the second generation, no matter how much money you have in the bank, no matter how many smart PhDs you have working for you,' says Jackson.

‘Look at how Google has struggled moving into social, and I think Facebook is going to have the same kind of challenges moving into mobile.’

He continued, ‘The world is moving faster, it’s getting more competitive, not less, and I think those who are dominant in their prior generation are really going to have a hard time moving into this newer generation.’
