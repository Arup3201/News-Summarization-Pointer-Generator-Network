Cherie has been treating her daughter Abbey with medicinal marijuana for several months and has seen a dramatic improvement in her condition

A NSW mother who was treating her two-year-old daughter with medicinal cannabis says the child has just months to live after police raided her supplier who was dobbed in to authorities by ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher.

Doctors told Cherie last year that her daughter Abbey would live only a few months as a result of CDKL5, a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes, as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities.

After months of failed treatment, and on the verge of admitting Abbey to a palliative care unit, Cherie bought some liquid medical marijuana from a supplier in Canberra and snuck it into the hospital and put it into Abbey's feeding tube.

The result on the two-year-old's health was extraordinary.

'The seizures were less intense, they weren't as long and she wasn't having as many of them,' Cherie told Daily Mail Australia.

'I started her on it without the knowledge of the staff at the hospital… They were quite surprised because they didn't know what was going on. The paediatrician commented on how well she was looking.'

Cherie describes Abbey, who is the youngest of her six children and the only one with the rare condition, as a 'cheeky' girl.

'She loves cuddles and she loves music, she just loves attention.'

But Cherie says it is likely that Abbey will die in the next few months, after her supply of medicinal cannabis dries up.

Cherie has enough medicinal cannabis to last Abbey for six weeks and no prospect of getting more since her cannabis supplier was raided in February.

'Once [the cannabis] is gone the seizures will return, there's no if and buts about it, there's a big risk of death,' she said.

Cherie found her supplier after talking to friends online who were treating their own children with medicinal cannabis for uncontrolled seizures.

'I did my own research and everything was so positive. One of my friends was giving her child medicinal cannabis, I asked if she could recommend someone.'

The supplier Cherie contacted was raided earlier this year after he was dobbed in to authorities by Katy Gallagher, ACT Chief Minister.

The man had regularly corresponded with Ms Gallagher about medicinal cannabis, but she reported him to police after he informed her he was administering marijuana to a child.

'I felt that there was no other alternative to me but to forward that to child protection and to police, I still think that was the right thing to do despite people raising concerns about it,' said Ms Gallagher.

She added that while she had 'huge empathy' for parents trying to find ways to alleviate the suffering of their sick children, she was required to forward on the man's email to police and child services.

'At the end of the day I think I have to operate within the laws that are currently in operation, which are very clear regarding marijuana and also child protection.'

Ms Gallagher has received abuse and death threats on social media for the decision, with people calling her a 'robotic kid killer' a 'hypocrite' for whom 'evil is not a strong enough word' and comparing her to 'Nazi death camp guards'.

'[Katy] would dob a homeless man into police for stealing bread cause stealing is illegal. Antiquated dinosaur,' wrote one person.

But critics are not finding support from Cherie, who said: 'I can understand where Katy's coming from, yet she could have had more compassion regarding the situation.'

The 60 Minutes TV program is airing a story on Sunday night about the fact that Australian families are being left with no choice but to break the law in order to save their children, while many families in America don’t need to go down that avenue as medicinal cannabis is legalised in some states.

The report reveals that politicians, doctors and patients in Australia are shifting their thinking and there's now a green rush to legalise cannabis for medicine nationwide.

Last week, governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania all signalled they would support law reform which would allow chronically-ill patients to take cannabis to relieve their suffering.

After rejecting a medicinal cannabis trial earlier this month, the Tasmanian government has announced it would be prepared to support the findings of an Upper House inquiry into medicinal cannabis.

Under a private member's bill to be introduced this month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally-ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis.

The renewed push to relax the laws comes as a new poll reveals two thirds of Australian’s support the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.

However, it’s unlikely there will be any change to the legislation in Victoria with the state government and the opposition admitting they have no immediate plans to legalise the drug.

Earlier this month, pregnant mother of one Cassie Batten was questioned by Victorian police over the use of cannabis oil to treat her epileptic three-year-old son.

Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Premier Mike Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments.

Mr Baird indicated his support after meeting Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old who in 2010 was told he would only live for a few more months.

The Tamworth resident began taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease and has made vast improvements in his health.

Tasmanian mum Nicole Cowles is hopeful the rising groundswell of support for the legalisation of medicinal marijuana could stop her having to obtain illegally from interstate suppliersto help the suffering of her daughter Alice Agnew, who is just eight.

‘I’m seeing Alice for who she really is – I only saw glimpses of her before,’ Ms Cowles said about the improvement of her daughter, who also suffers from CDKL5, since she started taking the liquid form of cannabis four times a day in February to help control her seizures.

The family is one of 200 across the country who are forced to import the cannabis from a supplier in Kempsey in NSW which is free of charge but the waiting list is sitting at 1,500 with people desperate to get their hands on the drug to relieve chronic pain and aid with seizures.
