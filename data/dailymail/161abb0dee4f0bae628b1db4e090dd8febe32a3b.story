A Canadian hunter was accidentally shot by his son-in-law who was trying to save him from a bear attack.

Wilf Lloyd, 56, was hunting with Skeet Podrasky in Fernie, British Colombia on Sunday when the bear attacked. 

It is understood that Podrasky, in a bid to save Lloyd from the bear, fired his rifle - missing animal.

A second shot hit and killed the animal according to CBC. 

Lloyd, from Cranbrook, was rushed to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. 

An air ambulance took him to Calgary's Foothills Hospital for treatment. 

Animal behavour expert Kevin Van Tighhem told Calgary CTV News: 'Even if you're able to score a lethal hit on the animal as it’s coming at you, it can still complete the attack because it’s running on adrenaline. On the other hand, bear spray, all it requires is a wall of spray between you and the bear. As soon as it hits the wall of spray, its attention is about getting away from that spray.'

It is understood the bear weighed in the region of 400lbs. Medics are planning to fit a metal rod into Lloyd's leg. It was feared at one stage that Lloyd could have lost his leg due to the severity of his injuries.
