The Government should do everything possible to support the family, David Cameron said yesterday in a speech reiterating his support for marriage.

He said families should be at the heart of everything politicians do, as he announced that online music videos would receive film-style age ratings to help protect children from sexual and violent content.

The Prime Minister also said that in future, all government policies will have to pass a ‘family- friendly’ test. His comments came after an official study found 500,000 troubled families cost taxpayers £30billion a year.

Mr Cameron said politicians were often 
reluctant to talk about relationships because they did not want to 
appear judgmental. However, he insisted the issue was too important to 
ignore.

He admitted that splitting up is the right course of action 
for some couples, and acknowledged that many single parents do an 
‘amazing job’ – but repeated his support for marriage.

‘For me, 
nothing matters more than family. It’s at the centre of my life and the 
heart of my politics ... that’s one of the reasons why I feel so 
strongly about supporting marriage,’ he said.

‘I’m not saying that 
marriage is the only way to make such a commitment, and we certainly 
shouldn’t judge people who feel marriage isn’t for them ... but neither 
do I think we should shy away from standing up for marriage in our 
society. I think it’s important that government sends a strong signal 
that we back marriage.’

In a speech to the Relationships Alliance 
group in London, Mr Cameron announced music videos appearing on the 
websites YouTube and Vevo will carry age ratings from the British Board 
of Film Classification.

The move follows concerns about racy videos from the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, who are popular with young children.

Asked
 about his own experiences with Nancy, ten, Arthur Elwen, eight, and 
three-year-old Florence, he said: ‘I am sure there are times when they 
have been disappointed because they haven’t been able to do something or
 see something.

Louise
 Casey, the Government's Troubled Families Tsar, has claimed many 
families are 'off the barometer' in the number of problems they have

‘But that is part of what being a parent is about: 
being able to deploy the use of the word “no”, and even sometimes to 
deploy the use of the off switch on the television, as unpopular as that
 might be, and sometimes ineffectual, because they find another screen 
somewhere that is switched on.’

From October, he said families’ 
interests will become an explicit element of policy impact assessments, 
alongside issues such as equality, the environment and value for money.

Mr Cameron also said the Home Office is looking at including details of mothers on marriage registers, as well as fathers.

Explaining
 that the rules had not changed since Victorian times, he said: ‘This 
clearly does not reflect modern Britain and it is high time the system 
was changed.’

He said he was ‘proud’ that the Coalition was 
recognising marriage in the tax system, and had taken action to ensure 
people of all sexualities could wed.

In this year’s Budget, the 
Chancellor confirmed new laws giving 4.1million couples a transferable 
tax allowance, worth up to £200 a year, from April 2015.

However, any
 couple in which one or both partners is a higher rate taxpayer (earning
 more than £42,285 a year) will be excluded from the tax break..
