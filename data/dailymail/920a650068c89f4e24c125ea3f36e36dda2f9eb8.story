John Ransford, chief executive of the Local Government Association, described his £300,000 pay packet as 'peanuts'

The outgoing head of the quango that acts as a mouthpiece for town halls has described his £300,000 salary as 'peanuts'.

John Ransford, who quit as the chief executive of the Local Government Association earlier this month, receives a total pay and pension package of £302,840.

He claimed this was 'not particularly out of line' with the salaries earned by other executive staff in the public sector.

However, he claimed it would be regarded as 'peanuts' by high-earners in finance and private industry.

But the 63-year-old added: 'I don't regard it as peanuts, I regard it as high pay.'

Mr Ransford's salary of more than £300,000 is more than double the Prime Minister's salary and £70,000 higher than it was last year.

His salary in 2009 was £193,923. This was increased in 2010 to £245,612 - a rise of more than 25 per cent. This is because he was promoted from deputy chief executive.

Details of his rapid salary increases came to light earlier this year when the Local Government Association published a report on high-earners within its ranks.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps then called for Mr Ransford to 'lead from the front' by taking a 10 per cent pay cut and 30 top councillors publicly criticised his remuneration package.

'This report is a devastating exposé of how fat cat pay has spiralled out of control in local government,' he said at the time. 'It seems many councils have taken their eye off the ball.'

But Mr Ransford this week told the Guardian that none of his 400 members had objected to his salary and blamed Mr Shapps for launching 'a quite unfair and unreasonable sting' against him through the media.

Mr Ransford is now planning to take a long break in New Zealand 'as far from Westminster as it is possible to go'.

He explained: 'I've done the heavy-lifting, I’ve given it my all. It’s for others now to perform on that stage.'

Mr Shapps today described Mr Ransford's comments as 'out of touch'.

He told the Telegraph: 'He has set such a bad example to local government advocating whopping fat cat salaries for chief executives whilst thousands of public sector workers are subject to a pay freeze or losing their jobs.

'We are calling time on the unacceptable practices of mega pay packets, boomerang bosses and double dipping to ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.'

Mr Ransford's replacement, Carolyn Down, is on a much lower salary of £169,000 a year, plus £27,000 in annual pension contributions.
