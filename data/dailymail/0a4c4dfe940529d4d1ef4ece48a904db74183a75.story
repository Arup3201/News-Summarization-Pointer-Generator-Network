Laura Bush has spoken out against the superficial scrutiny given to the First Ladies and hopes the eventual First Gentlemen is given the same treatment.

She said that while she thinks too much attention is paid to a first lady's hair and make up, 'I don't think we can get around it'.

'Maybe when we finally have a first gentleman. And maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also, and really critique the way they look all the timeâ€”their choice of tie or their hairstyle or whatever. Or maybe their weight,' she said.

Looking back: Former First Lady Laura Bush said that the first spouse should 'Stand back and be quiet'

'It'll be interesting when it finally happens what the First Gentlemen will do. I hope they take on men's health perhaps,' she said, making an underhanded slight at the pattern of initiatives that are seen as 'appropriate' for First Ladies to handle falls mostly in the realm of women's and children's health.

Mrs Bush was interviewed by C-SPAN as part of their ongoing series of interviews with former First Ladies.

In the clips released ahead of the full program, which will air on March 2, Mrs Bush dismissed the theory that those married to the President should receive a salary.

'I don't think so. There are plenty of perks, believe me!' she said.

'A chef, that was really great! I miss the chef.

Highlight: Mrs Bush said that one of her favorite moments during her husband's terms was when she unexpectantly took over the speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2005

'I think the interesting question really is not should they receive a salary but should they be able to work for a salary at their job that they might have already had and I think that's what we'll have to come to terms with.

'Certainly a first gentlemen might continue to work at whatever he did- if he was a lawyer or whatever he did. So I think that's really the question she should ask is should she have a career in those years that her husband is president in addition to serving as First Lady.'

She talks at length about questions of protocol that will arise when a woman is elected president and her husband is given the title of First Gentlemen- but doesn't once mention the most likely candidate: former President Bill Clinton.

She did have one key piece of advice for any first spouse, however.

Breaking the mold: In her interview, Mrs Bush never explicitly names Bill Clinton as the potential 'First Gentleman' but he seems like the most likely candidate (with the Clintons and Mrs Bush seen here at a 2004 event at the White House)

'Stand back and be quiet,' she said with a smile.

Mrs Bush is just the latest to be featured in the ongoing series, and her mother-in-law's turn came out earlier this month.

In it, the elder Mrs Bush said that while she 'loves' Bill Clinton but not his politics.

If she had her way, neither her son Jeb Bush nor Hillary Clinton would run for the White House in 2016- even though they are among the most likely candidates for their respective parties.

'I think this is a great American country, a great country, and if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office that's silly because there are great governors and great eligible people to run,' she said in a new interview.

'I think the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes- there are just more families than that.'

Twice is enough: Barbara Bush said that should her younger son Jeb decide to run for president in 2016, that would be pushing the amount of time that one family had been in the White House
