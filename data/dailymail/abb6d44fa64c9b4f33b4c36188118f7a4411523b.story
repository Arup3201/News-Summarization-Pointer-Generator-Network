Chinese police are looking for a father who allowed his son, aged three, to drive along what appears to be a motorway.

Not only did he make illegal turns, but at one point he heads the wrong way against what should have been oncoming traffic.

Video footage of the risky move quickly became one of the most popular shared items on Chinese social media sites.

Risky: A Chinese father let his son, aged just three, drive down a motorway in Beijing

Many commented that the lack of traffic on the road meant that it might well have been somewhere that had been recently built and was not yet in operation.

However, it was later identified by other users as being a section of motorway outside the capital, Beijing, which was open to traffic but meant for a business park and industrial complex that had not been built yet. It therefore had very little traffic, they said.

Dangerous: Local police said the stunt put the lives of other road users at risk

The six-minute long clip includes comments from the father about how proud he is of the three-year-old boy

The clip was posted anonymously, although police suspect it was the father who uploaded it

Local police declined to comment but said that allowing a child to drive on a public road was an offence for which the car owner risked a jail term, as it put the lives of others at risk.

The six-minute long clip includes comments from the father about how proud he is of the three-year-old boy.

From what he says it is clear that he videoed it for later internet publication, telling the boy to say hello to the people that would be watching.

The clip was posted anonymously, although police suspect it was the father who uploaded it.

Although the father comments on the video that the lack of traffic makes what his son is doing legal, it is still illegal for a child to drive on a public road.
