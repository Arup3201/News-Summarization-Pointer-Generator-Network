Fans of the hit television drama Broadchurch have complained they are finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'.

The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received wide-spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed ITV crime show.

But a number of viewers have complained that they are finding it increasingly difficult to understand his accent - ever since the second series got underway earlier this month.

Speaking out: Amanda Kerfoot was another to claim that David Tennant's accent was stronger than in the first series

Venting frustration: Fans have taken to Twitter to suggest that the actor's accent has become more Scottish

Some have vented their frustration on Twitter suggesting the Scottish actor is now using a stronger  accent.

One Broadchurch fan, Daniel Capwholdi wrote: 'Is it me or has David Tennant become more Scottish?' while CallMeLisa said: 'Speaking of strong accents I had to turn the subtitles on when I was watching Broadchurch because David Tennant is VERY Scottish.'

After the critically acclaimed first episode aired on January 5 this year, some baffled viewers accused the actor of 'mumbling' - to such an extent that they were struggling to understand parts of the plot.

ITV said at the time that it had received ‘fewer than five’ complaints about mumbled dialogue.

It is not the first time Broadchurch has sparked debate on social media with some pointing to inaccuracies in legal proceedings 

One of the Twitter users suggesting that this may be the result of a stronger Scottish accent was Anuja P. who wrote: 'Has Tennant gotten more Scottish in the new series of Broadchurch?'

But Walaa Mancy was just content to see the actor on screen, tweeting: 'I find it a little bit difficult to understand the Scottish accent, but it's David Tennant, so who cares?'

An ITV spokesman this afternoon pointed out that David Tennant was Scottish and merely speaking in his own accent 'as he usually would in every day life' - and denied that it had changed in any way.

It is not the first time Broadchurch has sparked debate on social media.

This morning, viewers accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene - table service from Nando's.

Disgruntled viewers have complained that the latest episode of ITV's crime show Broadchurch is unrealistic as it shows table service in fast food restaurant Nando's

Disgruntled fans complained after David Tennant was seen in the latest episode of the show, set in Dorset,  ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table.

At the Portuguese fast food chain, customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time.

Others have complained about the plot line, claiming there are a number of inaccuracies in the way legal proceedings have been portrayed

Elsewhere, mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. 

MailOnline has requested a comment from Mr Tennant's representatives this afternoon.

Digging up Danny's corpse. 

What happened: Danny Latimer’s parents Beth and Mark with prosecuting barrister Jocelyn Knight were horrified after Joe Miller’s defence team got Danny’s body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family. 

But retired detective Graham Walker told the Mail on Sunday: ‘The body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation. You would have to consult the family beforehand. The only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case.’

Use of spy cameras 

What happened: Hardy installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller - where a terrified Claire is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from Lee. 

Hardy installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller, but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court

But Graham Walker explains: ‘I’m afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court. Of course, if you suspect somebody of an offence, you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent.’

The wrong wig 

What happened: Sonia Sharma (Meera Syal) is the judge in the case of Joe Miller but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case.

Why Beth would never have been interrogated about her sex life

What happened: The judge allows the defence barrister to question Danny’s mother about her sex life and the affair her husband Mark had with a woman called Becca Fisher, even though it has no obvious connection to the murder. But criminal barrister Maria Dineen explains: ‘The sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed. There is no relevance whatsoever.'

Could Beth and Mark really select their own criminal barrister? 

What happened: Danny’s grieving parents choose retired local lawyer Jocelyn Knight as their prosecution barrister. 

But legal expert Baroness Kennedy says: ‘The whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of Queen.

Danny’s grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life

‘They are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim’s family does not get to choose the barrister.’ 

Witnesses can't stay to watch trial

What happened: Danny’s parents Beth and Mark, along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence. But Maria Dineen says: ‘Witnesses cannot sit through any part of the proceedings, nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part. They should never have been in court.’ 

How come the new suspect turns up everywhere? 

What happened: Lee Ashworth (James D’Arcy) – who is the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at Hardy. But bemused viewers have wondered exactly how Ashworth has been able to track down Hardy everywhere he goes so easily.

The newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old 

What happened: Those who watched last night's show criticised a storyline in which new mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth. Viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old.

A one in 7,000 occurrence

Fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female Asian judge, a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel.

In 2010, 35% of barristers were women, and 10% were from ethnic minorities. Meanwhile in 2011, 22% of judges were women and 5% were from ethnic minorities.

That makes the diversity likelihood of the Broadchurch trial a one in 7,000 occurrence.
