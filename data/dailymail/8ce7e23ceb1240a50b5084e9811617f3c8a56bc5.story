It is a disservice to both competitions to compare the Commonwealths — the ‘Friendly Games’ —  to the Olympics, but there is one legacy of London 2012 that is very much alive in Glasgow.

The Australians are desperate to forget about their embarrassing performance two years ago, when they finished a lowly 10th in the medals table. Beset by in-fighting and lacking discipline, they won only seven golds as Great Britain plundered 29 to finish third overall.

The Commonwealth Games have, therefore, suddenly become very important for Australia as a great sporting nation attempts to rebuild towards the Olympics in 2016.

Australia need a strong performance at the Commonwealth Games after being embarrassed at London 2012

Where once the  Games might have been a chance to impress Australia’s might on fellow Commonwealth countries, there is now considerable pride at stake.

The 2018 Games will take place on the Gold Coast, and Australia has topped every medals table at the Commonwealths since 1986. The country’s chef de mission, Steve Moneghetti, wants 111 medals as a minimum in Glasgow, although he has admitted Australia will have their ‘work cut out just to win the medal tally, let alone dominate it’.

England are very different to the weakened team that arrived in Delhi in 2010. Many of their  high-profile stars stayed at home rather than risk their safety and security just two years from London 2012.

But the Commonwealth Games just across the border is a very different matter. England, for example, have won three golds, a silver and a bronze as they dominated the men’s, women’s and mixed team medley events in triathlon while Australia have had to make do with a bronze.

Shooter Michael Gault has a chance to overtake Australian Phillip Adams' record Commonwealth medal haul

Australian shooter Phillip Adams, the most decorated Commonwealth Games athlete, also now has an Englishman for company after 60-year-old grandfather Mick Gault won a bronze in the 10m air pistol yesterday. Gault now has the opportunity to go one clear of Adams and win his 19th medal in the 50m air pistol.

Yet in the pool and on the track cycling, some things never change. Australian Anna Meares has already won the 500m time trial and will face compatriot Stephanie Morton as she bids for her six Commonwealth title in the women’s sprint. The double Olympic champion, 30, looked as imperious as ever on Saturday as she swatted aside England’s Jess Varnish in her semi-final.

Australia won the first seven races of the evening session inside the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome, including gold for Annette Edmondson in the 10k scratch race. The Australian, whose mother Cathy grew up in Elgin, gained revenge over England’s Joanna Rowsell, who beat her comprehensively in the individual pursuit  final on Friday, and led an Australian one-two ahead of Amy Cure. Wales’ Elinor Barker was third.

The day had begun with a thrilling contest between Australia and England in the group stage of the netball, with the team in green and gold sneaking a 49-48 win in the last 30 seconds.  Netball has been dominated by Australia and New Zealand, the highest ranked teams in the world, since it was introduced into the Commonwealths in 1998, but England still maintain this is their chance to improve on their three bronze medals to date.

Anna Mayes’s side thrashed Australia 3-0 in a Test series last year, but the doubts resurfaced yesterday as England squandered a 16-10 lead and suffered a crushing defeat by an aggressive Australian side.

It does not make England’s dream of gold impossible, but life will be harder given New Zealand are the likely semi-final opponents for the team finishing second in this group.

With the scores level at 48-48 after going with the centre pass, England goal shooter Joanne Harten, one of the five English women who play in Australia and New Zealand’s semi-professional ANZ Championship, failed to convert a shot at goal.

Australia raced to the other end and Caitlin Bassett scored her 36th goal of the morning to claim victory, leaving Harten in tears.

England goalkeeper Geva Mentor said: ‘We’re still serious contenders. I’m very excited by this team and I know we can go all the way.’

England’s Ed Clancy was unable to claim a podium place as Australian Scott Sunderland took gold by setting a new Games record of 1min 0.675secs in the final race of the 1000m time trial.
