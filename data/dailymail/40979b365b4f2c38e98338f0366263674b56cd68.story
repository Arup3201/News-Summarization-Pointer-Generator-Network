Gold Coast teenager Todd Elswick prompted a serious police response when spotted playing with a toy gun at home on Tuesday

A teenager on Queensland's Gold Coast had a very real-life experience while fooling around with a toy gun at a family gathering on Tuesday.

Todd Eslick from Upper Coomera sparked a swift and strong response from police in the area and got the surprise of his life when a dog squad and officers in bullet-proof vests turned up at his home.

Police officers stormed Clydesdale Drive around 10am while a police helicopter monitored the situation from above, while several nearby streets were sent into lock down.

It is thought a spooked passerby made a call to police after another family member had pointed the fake weapon at their car.

Todd told the Gold Coast Bulletin he and his family spotted the helicopter above while he was messing around at home, but they were unsure what it was doing.

'I saw the chopper and next thing I saw cops coming down with dogs,' he said.

The 18-year-old told the publication that he then was ordered to the ground by an officer, who had his hand on his weapon.

'I got on the ground and they pat me down and stuff. They [police] are pretty big, a lot bigger than me.

'It was something to remember.'

Todd's father, Les, said he was impressed that police were on the ball and he was glad they were doing their job efficiently.

He also told the Bulletin he held no grudge for their unannounced arrival at the family event.

A police spokeswoman said three police crews were sent to the scene with a fourth on standby should things have escalated, and the teenager will not face charges over the incident.
