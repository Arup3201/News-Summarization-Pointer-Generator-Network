While millions of people around the world are tuned into Prince George's christening in the UK today, Ivanka Trump is celebrating her own newborn with a different religious ceremony.

The 31-year-old entrepreneur, who welcomed baby Joseph Frederick with her husband Jared Kushner last Monday, shared an Instagram picture of herself in a black dress and black cap, her little one wrapped in a long white robe.

Judging by their outfits and the timing of the shot, the mother-son duo were likely celebrating Joseph's bris - a traditional Jewish circumcision ceremony.

Religious celebration: Ms Trump's Instagram page is often dominated by photos of her growing brood (pictured giving baby Joseph Frederick a kiss at his bris ceremony last month)

Ms Trump captioned the image: 'One week old. Thanks to all of you for your kind words and best wishes.'

The mother-of-two paired her black ensemble with matching black stilettos and dangling diamond earrings, her hair pulled back in a chic chignon.

Despite giving birth just over a week ago, Ms Trump looked as trim and youthful as ever, showing off her toned legs in the short dress.

A bris is held on a babyâ€™s eighth day in the world, meaning the photo shared by Ms Trump was likely taken on Monday.

The ceremony, which is typically held at the parents' home, consists of the baby's circumcision performed by a mohel - a Jewish man who has been trained to do the procedure.

Ms Trump's two-year-old daughter Arabella was likely in attendance, as she has shown a particular fondness for her new baby brother.

The toddler was pictured in an Instagram photo on Monday practicing her medical skills as she held a toy stethoscope to Joseph's chest.

To announce the birth of her son, Ms 
Trump again took to Instagram, where she shared a picture of herself

'We welcome with love, Joseph Frederick Kushner,' she captioned the touching photo, before going into more detail about the child's moniker.

She wrote that the boy was 'named 
after each of our paternal grandfathers, both master builders of their 
generation and inspiring patriarchs of their families.'

She
 added: 'Both men set the standards that have been passed down through 
the generations and which we hope to impart upon Joseph and Arabella.

'They created a legacy for our family that inspires our careers as well as our love and respect for one another.'
