A group of mothers are campaigning to remove an inappropriate range of Kardashian Kids clothing from the shelves of all Babies 'R' Us stores.

Kansas-based mother Amie Logan started an online petition asking the retailer to remove the 'damaging' garments after seeing the new collection, which is designed for baby girls aged zero to 24 months, on shelves and online.

The campaign comes just one week after Babies 'R' Us' sister store Toys 'R' Us agreed to stop selling a line of Breaking Bad action figures, after parents accused the retailer of promoting drug use through the sale of the toys.

Leading the charge: Kansas mother Amie Logan started the campaign to remove the inappropriate designs

Fashion faux pas: Many parents are outraged by the 'sexualized' nature of the designs

Appropriate? The Kardashian Kids collection includes this $23 pleather mini skirt 

'I don't want my child to grow up to be a Sex Tape star,' Amie wrote at the top of her petition, which is posted on Change.org. 'You pulled the Breaking Bad toys because they promoted Drug use. You should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well. 

'The madness has to stop. If the toys are damaging so is the clothing.'

The collection, which is an extension of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney's globally-successful Kardashian Kollection for adults, includes a $25 leatherette mini skirt - with 'attached diaper cover' - a $33 fur faux animal print vest and a $23 leatherette skirt.

Each of the designs, while not necessarily the personal handiwork of Kim, 34, Khloe, 30 and Kourtney, 35, have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters which is perhaps all the more disturbing given that Kim and Kourtney both have young daughters of their own.

Kourtney welcomed her daughter Penelope, her second child with long-term partner Scott Disick, in July 2012, while Kim and Kanye West's daughter North was born on June 15 last year.

At the time of writing, the petition, which is just a few days old, has already been signed more than 2,000 times by eager supporters, many of whom wholeheartedly agree with Amie's thoughts about the offending clothing designs.

Motherly instincts: Both Kim, 34, and Kourtney, 35, have young daughters of their own

'Damaging': The designs, such as this pair of gold lurex pants, have been deemed completely inappropriate for young children

'Disgusting': The collection includes a number of short skirts and tight-fitting lurex trousers 

Monique Smith from Greensboro, North Carolina, wrote: 'Babies don't need to look like porn stars' while Liz Thomas from Gainesville, Florida added: 'Breaking Bad toys are nowhere near as damaging to a young psyche as sexualization at such a young age. 

'These people should be ashamed.' 

The campaign has also convinced some people to boycott the store entirely, with one mother commenting on the petition: 'Disgusting. I had no clue. I was just looking at starting my baby registry at Babies R Us last night. I am so glad I saw this first. 

Kardashian controversy: While Khloe, Kim and Kourtney did not design each of the garments themselves, each item of clothing has been given their seal of approval

Car crash clothing: While the Kardashians' clothing collections have proved incredibly popular with adults, they seem to have missed the mark with their unsuitable childrenswear designs

'I would never spend my money on it': The petition has now been signed by more than 2,000 people, many of whom have children and grandchildren of their own

'S****s and babies just do not go together. Babies are innocent, Kim is a s***k, any questions?'

And it's not just parents who have taken offence at the inappropriate clothing collection. Jenny Chavez, a grandmother from Chula Vista, California, said of the designs: 'I am a grandmother and shop at Babys R Us. 

'I find the Kardiashian kids clothing line completely inappropriate and would never spend my money on any Kardashian merchandise that promotes their stardom from a sex tape.'

MailOnline has contacted Babies 'R' Us for a comment.
