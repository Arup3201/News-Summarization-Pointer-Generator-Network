As she stepped off the royal train at Elgin Station yesterday, a succession of flunkies could be seen ferrying the Queen's wardrobe from the locomotive to a waiting van.

Piles of garment bags and stacks of hat boxes could all be seen peeking out - and all this just for one weekend away.

But as royal watchers know, the monarch, 88, has a reputation for never travelling light  and has a team of dressers to ensure that no matter what happens, the Queen will always look pristine.

In total, the Queen's wardrobe department includes 12 people whose job it is to make sure she looks great on big occasions such as yesterday's visit to RAF Lossiemouth. 

For that, she wore a chic lavender coat by designer Karl Ludwig and a matching hat by dresser Angela Kelly, all accessorised with one of her trademark Launer handbags.

Kelly, who has been working with the Queen since 1994, is the head of the wardrobe team, which also includes three dressmakers, a milliner and four dressers, who, as their job title suggests, help the Queen get dressed as well as keeping unworn garments in pristine condition.

During busy periods, such as 2012's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the team drafts in extra staff, with an additional two needed for the spate of events that accompanied the Jubilee celebrations.

Outfits are chosen by the Queen, with Miss Kelly , Angela makes notes of the Queen’s wishes and ideas for alterations before producing a final technical drawing from which the pattern is cut.

To stop her feeling uncomfortable or getting too warm when she is on official business, the Queen insists on loose clothing. 

All of her clothes are made of natural fibres: 100 per cent pure cotton or wool, no linen (it creases too easily) and certainly no polyester.

When she travels, Angela Kelly, her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe, ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand so that if something is spilled on her clothes or there is any other mishap, Her Majesty can discreetly change into a new set without anyone knowing - which perhaps explains the two garment bags in the back of the van.

If disaster does strike, the ensemble won't be sent to a dry cleaner - all clothes are hand-washed, steamed and pressed by one of her three dressers to avoid any unpleasant chemical smells.

As for cosmetics,  Angela Kelly uses a special, secret formula for the Queen’s foundation, which prevents too much shine on her face.

Another royal beauty secret is a gel that keeps her hair firmly in place (even in gale-force winds) and is mischievously known among royal staff as ‘liquid concrete’.

Her Majesty’s hairdresser also keeps a couple of huge hat-pins handy, just in case the ones already in place don't prove equal to the task.

Incidentally, you will never see Her Majesty removing her headgear in public; she always waits until she is safely back indoors.

And it isn't it just clothes and make-up in the Queen's cases. When she is travelling, the monarch is never without several cases of Malvern water - always still, never sparkling. 

She is jokingly said to suffer withdrawal symptoms when deprived of her bottle of Malvern.Then there’s a plentiful supply of Earl Grey tea, her favourite, which is made especially for her by Twinings.

She favours a blend of China and Darjeeling, ‘delicately scented with oil of bergamot’, and drinks it with a special sweetener, which she carries herself.

Coffee is supplied by the Savoy Hotel coffee department and is much favoured by the Duke of Edinburgh.

Though she carries her own bag (which contains just a handkerchief, lipstick, a tiny mirror and a copy of the day’s programme), one of her ladies-in-waiting always has what is known as the ‘Brown Bag’.

This holds all the essentials she might need in an emergency: spare pairs of tights, gloves, sweeteners and a moist, lavender-scented cloth in case of extreme heat.

She also carries a hook to hang her bag on from the table, her reading glasses, mint lozenges and a collection of good luck charms given to her by her children, including miniature dogs, horses and saddles.

One item the Queen does not pack is her own lavatory seat - unlike Prince Charles, who it is said takes a white leather one on every official trip.
