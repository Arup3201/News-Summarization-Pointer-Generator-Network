A castle with its own moat, turrets and dungeon has gone on sale for £3million.

Caverswall Castle, near the village of Caverswall in Stoke-on-Trent, dates back to 1275 and has 20bedrooms.

The rooms are adorned with furniture from the Jacobean, Georgian and Victorian eras and even comes with tapestries and suits of armour which can be bought separately.

Fit for a king: Caverswall Castle, near  Stoke-on-Trent, dates back to 1275 and is on the market for £3million

But like with any property this size, there are huge running costs.

Its current owner, property developer Robin MacDonald, says the oil, gas, electricity and water billsamount to £10,000 to £12,000 year alone and that is before any repairs. 

He bought the castle eight years ago for £1.7million and has spent £1million doing it up.

One of the main reasons why Mr MacDonald has decided to sell is because of an ongoing battle with the council planning department.

The castle, classified for residential use, was briefly used as a wedding venue but this was stopped because the correct planning permission had not been sought.

An application has been submitted for the castle to be transformed into a 'fat camp' where people can eat healthily and exercise but Mr MacDonald is still awaiting a decision.

According to Mr MacDonald, town hall bosses have suggested that the castle could be turned into aboutique hotel.

There are also three converted turret cottages with self-containing living quarters includingbedrooms and lounges.

Previous residents include the Wedgwood pottery family who lived in the castle between 1878 and 1890.

However they too were forced to leave, according to English Local History, because they found the castle 'damp, cold and in need of constant repairs.'

Mr MacDonald told Bricks & Mortar in The Times: 'When I bought it, it was a shell.

'It had been a long time since anyone with money had owned it, so it was in a state of neglect. I originally came across it on Rightmove, I was looking for a nice home to retire to - not that that happened - and this moated castle popped up. I thought to myself, "Wow, it's a castle."'

The
 property is on the market with Strutt & Parker estate agency and 
the 20,000 sq ft floorplan spans five pages in the marketing brochure.

David Henderson, a partner at Strutt & Parker, said the castle had been owned by a 'succession ofsuccessful people who wanted a statement of wealth and power.'

He also said it was very rare to find a moated castle on the market for sale these days.

As for Mr MacDonald, he is planning to downsize and plan more time with his young family.

But he added: 'I don't see us moving from Caverswall to a two-up, two-down, put it that way.'
