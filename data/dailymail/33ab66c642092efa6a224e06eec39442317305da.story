Business Secretary Vince Cable tonight attacked the 'utterly reprehensible' behaviour of his close friend Lord Oakeshot - after it emerged he had paid for a poll that showed Nick Clegg was doomed to election defeat.

Mr Cable said his friend's bid to topple the Deputy Prime Minister in the wake of the party's European and local elections disaster was 'totally inexcusable'.

The Lib Dem Cabinet Minister's decision to name Lord Oakeshott as the source of the damning research came as Mr Clegg was left pleading with his party not to sack him.Mr Cable tonight insisted there was 'no leadership issue' as far as he was concerned.

Vince Cable moved to distance himself from his friend Lord Oakeshott tonight after confirming that he was behind a damaging poll on the Deputy PM's leadership

insisted the Lib Dem peer was not his spokesman

Nick Clegg faced growing criticism over his leadership today following last week's disastrous showing at the European and local elections

The dramatic development came after pollsters ICM released the new survey revealing that Mr Clegg could lose his own seat at the general election.

It showed that if an election was held now, Mr Clegg would finish third in his constituency - behind Labour and the Tories.

More than half of Mr Clegg's constituents thought he was doing a bad or 'very bad' job as Deputy Prime Minister - while around 45% said he was a bad local MP.

Meanwhile, almost one in three voters in Sheffield Hallam did not even know Mr Clegg was their MP, the poll found.

The poll sparked fury among Mr Clegg's allies who suspected Lord Oakeshott had commissioned the study to topple the Deputy Prime Minister and replace him with Mr Cable.

But the Business Secretary released a statement tonight denying that Lord Oakeshott spoke for him.

He said: 'Lord Oakeshott's actions are totally inexcusable and unacceptable. I have made it very clear repeatedly that he does not speak or act for me.

'Commissioning and publishing polls without the consent of the Member of Parliament, as in the case of Sheffield Hallam, is utterly reprehensible.

'There are undoubtedly raw feelings in the wake of poor local and European election results. We need to respond in a measured way.

'Public speculation about the leadership is an unwelcome distraction and as I made absolutely clear yesterday there is no leadership issue as far as I'm concerned.'

The Deputy Prime Minister appeared more relaxed and happy than yesterday as he played pool with 16 and 17-year-olds at a training centre at St Andrew's Youth Club, in central London this morning

Mr Cable's bombshell statement came after Mr Clegg pleaded with Lib Dem MPs not to 'lose their nerve' and get rid of 
him.

The
 Deputy Prime Minister admitted he had lost the argument over Europe and
 immigration with Nigel Farage, in the wake of last week's disastrous 
European and local election results.

But
 the Lib Dem leader insisted he would not quit. He said he wanted to 
'finish the job' and dismissed calls to dissolve the coalition or shift 
the party's approach to Europe.

Asked
 this morning if he was prepared to stand down, Mr Clegg said: 'Look, I 
think if I felt or indeed if the whole party felt that changing 
strategy, changing leaders, pulling out of the coalition, which is what a
 number of these individuals advocate, would deal with the challenge 
which the party faces, because of course we face challenges - that's 
obviously daft to suggest otherwise - then I wouldn't hesitate to 
advocate it.

'But
 I think it's so important that particularly at a time when our big 
judgments as a party over the last few years, difficult years they've 
been politically, are now being vindicated in terms of delivering the 
economic recovery that we came to this Government to deliver, delivering
 all the things that we've been campaigning on for years.

'I
 think that's not the time to start turning inwards when we of course as
 a party, as a campaigning party should be talking to the British people
 about what we want to do in the future.'

Asked later what he would do to win back voters, Mr Clegg reaffirmed his commitment to the Coalition and said it was the 'wrong time to lose our nerve'.

He said: 'I don't think pulling out of the Coalition is the answer. We said back in 2010 very, very clearly that we were making a five-year commitment.

'We knew it was going to be tough, not only tough of course entering into a coalition in the first place, but also doing the very downright difficult and controversial things that we needed to do to fix the economy.

'But I think a year out before a general election, exactly at the point, as I say, when those big judgments are proving their worth, would be the wrong time to lose our nerve.'

He added: 'I think it's very important that we see that through because otherwise, of course, a lot of people will conclude that somehow the Liberal Democrats are only comfortable in opposition.'

Mr Clegg was bombarded with questions from reporters when leaving his home in South London this morning

Asked if he had lost the argument on Europe, Mr Clegg said: 'I totally accept, of course, the verdict of voters last week that we did not win the case that I was putting and my party was putting.'

But he added: 'The argument has now started and I hope and believe over time it will be won.'

Mr Clegg received support from unlikely sources yesterday - as Tony Blair and David Cameron threw their weight behind him.

This morning Downing Street made clear Mr Cameron wanted the Deputy PM to stay on.

Meanwhile, former PM Tony Blair said he admired the 'leadership and courage' the Lib Dem leader had shown in power.

The backing came with Mr Clegg under intense pressure after his party lost hundreds of councillors and 11 of its 12 MEPs.

He has received public support from senior Lib Dem colleagues, but a number of MPs and activists have broken cover to warn he is 'toxic' for voters and must go.

A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister was repeatedly asked about Mr Clegg's position at a briefing for journalists this morning.

She said: 'This is a strong coalition that is pursuing its long term economic plan.'

Pressed on whether that meant Mr Cameron wanted his deputy to remain in place, the spokeswoman replied: "I think I have said that...

'I've been clear the PM is intent on working with the coalition, with the Deputy Prime Minister to secure the economic recovery and to keep improving the situation for Britain's hard-working families.

'He's focused on working with the Deputy Prime Minister as part of the coalition to deliver on the Government's plans.'

Nigel Farage was congratulated during a meeting of the leaders of European Parliament political groups in Brussels today

Quizzed on whether Mr Cameron could work with anyone else if Mr Clegg was overthrown, the spokeswoman said: 'I have not seen anything from either the PM or Deputy PM to suggest that is happening, and they are very much focused on working together and continuing with the achievements that the coalition has made.'

Mr Blair told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he did not think the Lib Dems' decision to campaign in the European election as the 'party of in' had been their main problem.

He said: 'To be fair to Nick Clegg - and I don't want to damage him by saying this - I think over the past few years he has shown quite a lot of leadership and courage.

'The problem they have is nothing to do with Europe. The problem they have is very simple. They fought the 2010 election on a platform significantly to the left of Labour and then ended up in a Conservative Government with a platform significantly to the right of Labour. There's not really a cure for that.'
