Afghanistan could slip back into the hands of extremists and pose a terrorist threat to  the West when Western troops leave, experts have warned.

David Cameron claimed at a Nato summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal by the end of December 2014 are ‘on track and on target’.

Barack Obama went even further, declaring that the allies would soon be able to say: ‘The Afghan war as we know it is over.’

But despite those optimistic statements, the U.S. commander of Nato’s troops said they would have to fight their way out of the country.

A senior British official also conceded that it was ‘unrealistic’ to assume Afghanistan ‘is going to be completely secure’ or that there would be ‘no possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging’. 

Yesterday’s summit was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013.

General John Allen said he ‘fully expects that combat is going to continue’ past that milestone.

‘There is no end of combat before the end of 2014,’ he added. ‘And in fact, the Taliban will oppose the Afghan National Security Forces after 2014.’

He went on to warn that Nato may need to send more troops to Helmand province, where British forces are currently stationed, if extremists seize ground vacated by the allies.

Mr Obama, presiding over a 50-nation war coalition summit in his hometown, summed up the mood by saying the Afghanistan that will be left behind will be stable enough for them to depart - essentially good enough after a decade of war- but still loaded with troubles.

'I don't think there's ever going to be an optimal point where we say, "This is all done. This is perfect. This is just the way we wanted it,''' Mr Obama said. 'This is a process, and it's sometimes a messy process.'

Afghan forces for the first time will take over the lead of the combat mission by the middle of 2013, a milestone moment in a long, costly transition of control.

Even in a backup role, U.S. forces and all the rest will face surprise attacks and bombings until the war's end.

The partners are in essence staying the course on Afghanistan. They stuck with a timeline long established and underscored that there will be no second-guessing the decision about when to leave.

Questioned about what will happen if Afghanistan eventually falls apart, Mr Obama signalled that there is no turning back.

'I think that the timetable that we've established is a sound one, it is a responsible one. Are there risks involved in it? Absolutely.'

Mr Cameron insisted that British troops will have completed their mission and can leave ‘with their heads held high’ – but he conceded that Western leaders would not control the country’s fate.

‘British troops will no longer be in a combat role beyond the end of 2014,’ he said. ‘That is our deadline. And at this summit, Nato confirmed it will be the deadline for the ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] mission.

'The plan for the transition of full security responsibility from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces is on track and on target.’
