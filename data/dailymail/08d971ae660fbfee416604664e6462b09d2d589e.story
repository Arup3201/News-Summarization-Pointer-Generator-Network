Professors at an Alabama university described James Holmes as an excellent candidate for their neuroscience program in February 2011, but rejected him anyway after his behaviour raised concerns.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham on Thursday released the application of the man accused of the Colorado movie theatre shooting rampage, including interview forms from his visit to the school.

Professors described him as a top-notch student and shy. One professor doubted whether he wanted Holmes in his lab, noting that 'he may be extremely smart, but difficult to engage.'

Another wrote: 'His personality may not be as engaging as some applicants, but he is going to be a leader.'

A message left for Scott Wilson at the school's neurobiology program was not immediately returned.

The application was obtained from the school. According to admissions experts, federal privacy laws do not cover graduate student applications.

Holmes graduated from the University of California, Riverside in June of 2010 while earning a 3.94 Grade Point Average out of a 4.0 scale, according to newly released transcripts.

Furbishing his GPA, Holmes received A+ grades in biology, chemistry, economics and Spanish. In a course taken titled Ethics and the Meaning of Life, he received an A.

Following his rejection and withdrawal of another graduate application to theÂ  University of Kansas, Holmes later enrolled as a first-year Ph.D. student in a neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Denver.

Concerns: Holmes' rejection by the University of Alabama at Birmingham is the second for the accused shooter whose interview for their neuroscience programme raised concerns

He withdrew about six weeks before the July 20 attack in Aurora, a Denver suburb.

Prosecutors say the 24-year-old 
opened fire during a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie, 'The 
Dark Knight Rises,' killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.

Holmes also raised concerns at CU 
where university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton said she contacted police in 
June after a meeting with Holmes.

Defense
attorneys claim Holmes is mentally ill and sought help from Fenton, 
while prosecutors paint a picture of a man angry at the failure of a 
once-promising academic career.

Prosecutors
say Holmes had failed a key oral exam in June at about the same time he
was stockpiling guns, ammunition and body armour.

The University of Iowa also rejected Holmes' application.

According to university records released last week, he was interviewed, but neuroscience program director Daniel Tranel wrote a strongly worded email urging the admissions committee not to accept Holmes.

Top student: Holmes achieved a 3.95 GPA while attending the University of California Riverside and graduating with honors in 2010

'James Holmes: Do NOT offer admission under any circumstances,' wrote Tranel, a professor of neurology.

Psychology professor Mark Blumberg followed up with a separate email to say he agreed. Blumberg recommended admission for the other two.

Neither official elaborated on their reasoning in the emails.

Holmes graduated from the University 
of California, Riverside in June of 2010 while earning a 3.94 Grade 
Point Average out of a 4.0 scale, according to newly released 
transcripts.

Furbishing his GPA, Holmes received A+
grades in biology, chemistry, economics and Spanish. In a course taken 
titled Ethics and the Meaning of Life, he received an A.

University of Iowa President Sally Mason said on Thursday she had 'no idea' whether Holmes raised red flags or why he was rejected.

But she said the case illustrates the critical significance that interviews play in evaluating prospective graduate students, and how candidates who appear strong on paper might not measure up in person.

'Getting to know someone, hearing them, meeting them face-to-face can tell you a lot about an individual,' she said.

Michael Reilly, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said graduate applicants are not covered by federal student privacy laws and there are no reporting requirements if somebody raises a concern.

Reilly said the graduate candidate interviews are more detailed because the programs involve working with a research professor in a close lab setting for a number of years.

'They want to read a little more closely the responses of applicants that this is somebody who is not just bright, but sane and focused,' Reilly said.

He said screening applicants who are intelligent but socially awkward could be a topic for a study session at the organization's convention. Members of the organization include most of the major not-for-profit and public universities that include the University of Iowa, University of Colorado and the University of Alabama.
