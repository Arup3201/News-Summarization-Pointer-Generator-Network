A young British backpacker was being hailed a hero today after risking his life to try to save a drowning man in wild seas in New Zealand.

Simon Constable, 20, from Yorkshire, did not hesitate before jumping into the sea at Tolaga Bay Wharf, north of Gisborne, on New Zealand's East Coast, when the troubled man’s family begged him to help.

A 38-year-old Malaysian man - who has yet to be named - was clinging to a pylon under a pier as heavy waves crashed into him.

Realising the man, also a tourist, was in serious trouble, Mr Constable dived into the rough water and swam towards him.

’I went down the ladder on the side of the wharf and saw the man clinging to one of the piles (pylons) underneath,’ he told the Gisborne Herald.

‘He had the pile in a bear hug and I dived in to help him.

‘As I swam towards him, he let go of the pile and was drifting. I grabbed him from behind under his arms but a wave came and pushed us against another pile.

‘We both went under the water and at that point I lost him.’

On coming back up to the surface Mr Constable looked around but there was no sign of the man.

‘I searched around for about five minutes, then went back to the ladder,’ he said.

The incident took place at Tolaga Bay Wharf, north of Gisborne, on New Zealand's East Coast

Mr Constable had gone to the wharf, at Tolaga Bay, with other tourists and some of the group began having fun jumping into the water, including Mr Constable and the Malaysian.

When the man’s sister saw him get into trouble, she pleaded with other tour party members to help him and that was when Mr Constable didn’t hesitate.

‘His actions were heroic,’ police sergeant Greg Lexmond said today.

‘It was very noble of him to dive in and do his best to save the guy,’ he told the paper.

A big swell was sweeping in through the bay, he said, and conditions were marginal for people who were confident in their ability in the water.

Hopes were fading today for the missing man as a search by frogmen and helicopter crews continued

Sergeant Lexmond’s sentiments were shared by Tolaga Bay chief fire officer Ray Dever who praised Mr Constable’s courage.

‘That was a fair gutsy move for Mr Constable to jump in to help in those conditions and he should be commended in some way for it.

‘Jumping off the end of the wharf is on the itinerary for the tour company but I question whether the conditions yesterday afternoon were safe enough.’

Hopes were fading today for the missing man as a search by frogmen and helicopter crews continued.
