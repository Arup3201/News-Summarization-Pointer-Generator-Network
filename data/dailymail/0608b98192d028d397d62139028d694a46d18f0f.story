A registry office marriage ceremony was revealed to be a sham just moments after the ceremony finished when the bride and groom hastily removed their wedding rings, a court has heard.

Instead of exchanging kisses, the bride Marcela Tancosova and the groom Choudry Kanwal took off the rings and handed them to a guest at the Sheffield ceremony.

But unfortunately for them the moment was captured by CCTV cameras and it led to the couple, from Slovakia and Pakistan respectively, being arrested for a fake marriage.

Further investigations revealed that Tancosova, 35, was pregnant by another man, she had a husband back in her home country and lived with another Slovakian man who was in prison at the time.

The couple could only communicate using sign language.

Jailing the bride for 12 months at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Peter Kelson told Tancosova: 'There was little better evidence than (that) as you left the Register Office the CCTV showed you and your false husband immediately took off your rings and handed them to somebody else.

The court heard that her co-defendant Sajid Mehmood, 38, had previously 'fixed' three sham marriages in Sheffield.

When he was arrested over one of them, a 'shopping list' was found in his car along with a cheap wedding ring.

The incriminating list, which was written in Urdu, read: 'Girl £4,500; P60 £1,900; wedding permission £600; wedding expenses £200; Home Office £2,100.'

Both Tancosova, of Bradford and Mehmood, of Sheffield, admitted conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of immigration laws.

Choudry Kanwal and Tancosova also admitted a second offence of making a false marriage statement.

Ms Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said Kanwal, a Pakistani national, submitted an application to the Home Office for a certificate of approval on July 21, 2009 to allow him to marry Tancosova backed up by documentation.

In May 2010, Tancosova and Kanwal completed their notice of marriage forms at Sheffield Register Office with Tancosova declaring she was free to marry when she had a gravely ill husband in Slovakia.

The couple got married on June 17, 2010 with Mehmood acting as 'interpreter' and signing the register in a false name.

While Tancosova had the right to remain in the UK as an EU citizen it emerged that Kanwal had entered the UK in 2007 on a six-month visitor’s visa and was here illegally.

Prosecutor Ms Wright, said: 'This was a sham marriage arranged solely with the intention of allowing Kanwal to remain in the UK and was facilitated by Mehmood.'

Kanwal submitted an application for a residency permit in July, 2010 but it was refused after Home Office officials became suspicious about the fake wedding and Tancosova was arrested at her Bradford home.

She claimed the marriage was genuine and that she lived part of the time with Kanwal in Sheffield but could not supply an address.

When arrested, Mehmood said he knew Kanwal from Pakistan and had backed his residency application but merely acted as an interpreter at the wedding.

Kanwal later jumped bail in February 2011 and remains on the run.

Defending Mehmood, a divorced father-of-four who has been granted leave to remain in the UK, Dermot Hughes said he had been well behaved since being released from a 15-month jail term for organising the other two sham marriages.

But Judge Peter Kelson said he would have jailed Mehmood for at least two years if he had been sentencing him for all three fake marriages.

'You have got very lucky with a 15-month sentence, it should have been rather longer than that,' he was told by the judge.

Mehmood received a community order with 200 hours of unpaid work.

The judge told Tancosova: 'You knew from start to last that this was a sham marriage with the promise of money.'
