WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT One of Britain’s top universities is to overhaul its animal research work after an undercover investigation revealed ‘appalling suffering’ in its labs.

Imperial College London, a world leader in scientific research, has admitted that there is ‘significant scope for improvement’ and has pledged to take immediate action.

The admission follows footage obtained by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection which showed rats being beheaded with a guillotine and having their necks broken at the end of experiments.

The BUAV, which infiltrated one of Imperial’s labs, also alleged that rats were able to wriggle around during operations, baby rats had their heads chopped off with scissors and that mice were found emaciated and ‘pitiful state’ on a Monday morning.

The harrowing images raised fears about the treatment of larger animals such as dogs, cats, pigs and monkeys in labs around the country.

They also sparked an independent review, which in a report released today accuses Imperial of complacency and calls for sweeping changes.

The review identified a lack of ‘adequate operational, leadership, management, training, supervisory and ethical review systems’ at Imperial, where more than 1,000 people are involved in animal research on four separate sites.

It made 33 recommendations for improvements – and said that other universities should also take note.

The panel, headed by Professor Steve Brown, of the Medical Research Council, found that training of scientists doing animal experiments was ‘ad hoc’ and that there was a ‘them and us’ culture between those looking after the animals and the scientists.

The review found while the mice and rats well were well fed and watered and kept in modern cages, there were serious concerns about their care during experiments.

This included whether research workers always responded rapidly enough to reports of sick animals, so that they could receive attention or be put down if this was necessary.

The university was criticised for an over-reliance on agency staff and the ethical committee that reviews applications for new research, evaluates existing projects and looks for ways to reduce the use of animals in future, was described as being  not fit for purpose.

The independent experts stressed that their remit was not to investigate the specific claims made by the BUAV, but the general systems employed at Imperial College.

They said that all lab animals deserved be treated humanely, even ‘just mice and rats’.

Calling for an immediate overhaul, Professor Brown said: ‘Our investigation identified a number of serious concerns on the conduct, management and oversight of animal research at Imperial College.

‘Imperial College is internationally recognised as one of the world’s best research institutes and it is important that this is matched by its standards of animal use and welfare.

‘While our focus has been on Imperial College, the committee’s recommendations should serve as a useful framework for other institutions to review their policies and practises.’

Imperial said it accepts all of the professor’s recommendations, including better training, more staffing, better leadership and more emphasis on finding ways of minimising the use of animals in research.

It stressed that it only uses animals when essential for developing new treatments and making medical advances.

A spokesman added: ‘The College reiterates its strong belief that the use of animals in research is essential to improve human and animal health and welfare.’

The BUAV said the report’s conclusions were a ‘devastating indictment’ and added: ‘If such criticisms can be levelled at one of the world’s leading universities, then it is inevitable that similar issues arise in research establishments all over the country.

‘It should not take an undercover investigation to expose what is happening in UK laboratories. The system overseeing animal experiments is broken and needs a drastic review.’

Dr Vicky Robinson, chief executive of the  NC3Rs, a government-funded body which looks for ways of reducing the number of animals used in research, said: ‘It is important that words are translated into action through appropriate ethical review, and having the right culture and organisational leadership.

‘As we have seen from the recent investigation even giants like Imperial College have some considerable work to do in this area.

This isn’t the time for finger pointing but an opportunity for the scientific community to ensure that it is truly operating at the highest standards when it comes to the difficult issue of research using animals.’

The Home Office, which regulates animal research and inspects labs, is carrying out a separate inquiry into the specific allegations made by the BUAV.

The Home Office said it will take action against anyone found to breach animal research regulations.
