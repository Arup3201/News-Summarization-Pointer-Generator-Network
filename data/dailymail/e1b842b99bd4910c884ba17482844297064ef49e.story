The mysterious properties of asteroids have long confounded astronomers, despite the billions spent in research.

Scientists believe they the materials deep within an asteroid's core could help unlock the secrets to how planets, like Earth, form.

Now a group of researchers has come one step closer to understanding these enigmatic objects by finding the first ever evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure.

Scientists have found the first evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure. Pictured here is a schematic view of asteroid Itokawa. The asteroid surface has two distinct surface types: a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface, and a bumpy zone, covered with a great number of rocks

The discovery was made by a team of astronomers at Kent University who found that different parts of a near-Earth asteroid - called Itokawa - have different densities.

Using telescope images from 2001 to 2013, Dr Stephen measured the speed peanut-shaped Itokawa spins and how its spin rate is changing over time.

They combined these delicate observations with new theoretical work on how asteroids radiate heat.

This provided the space scientists with a unique opportunity to explore its interior, revealing the complexity within its core and secrets about its formation.

The Itokawa asteroid was discovered in 1998 by the LINEAR mission. In August 2003, it was officially named after Hideo Itokawa, a Japanese rocket scientist.

The asteroid surface has two distinct surface types: a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface, and a bumpy zone, covered with a great number of rocks.

In 2000, it was selected as the target of Japan's Hayabusa mission. The probe arrived in the vicinity of Itokawa on 12 September 2005.

The probe collected samples from the surface and returned them to Earth for analysis.

Scientists were able to piece together the impact history of Itokawa, showing that that the asteroid had been shaped by collisions with objects ranging in size from 10 kilometers down to a nanometre.

‘This is the first time we have ever been able to determine what it is like inside an asteroid. We can see that this asteroid has a highly varied structure,’ said Dr Lowry.

‘This finding is a significant step forward in our understanding of rocky bodies in our solar system.’

The spin of an asteroid and other small bodies in space can be affected by sunlight.

This phenomenon, known as the YORP effect, occurs when absorbed photons from the sun are re-emitted from the surface of the object in the form of heat.

When the shape of the asteroid is very irregular the heat is not radiated evenly and this creates a tiny, but continuous, torque on the body and changes its spin rate.

Dr Lowry’s team measured that the YORP effect was slowly accelerating the speed at which it spins.

The change in rotation speed is tiny – only around 45 milliseconds per year - and was far from expected.

Scientists suspected Itokawa’s ‘bi-lobed’ or ‘peanut-like’ appearance is the result of two bodies of very different densities, that came together at some point in its ancient history.

This research is the first time that astronomers have found evidence for the highly-varied internal structure of asteroids.

Up until now, asteroid interiors could only be inferred using rough overall-density measurements.

This rare glimpse into the diverse innards of asteroid Itokawa has led to much speculation regarding its formation.

One possibility is that its origins lie within the catastrophic collapse of a double asteroid, also known as a binary asteroid system.

‘Finding asteroids which don’t have homogenous interiors has far-reaching implications, particularly for models of binary asteroid formation,’ said Dr Lowry.

‘It could also help with work on asteroid mitigation, or to plan future trips to these rocky bodies.’

This new ability to probe the interior of an asteroid - without the need for a visiting spacecraft with penetrating radar - is a significant step forward, and may unlock many secrets of asteroids in the future.
