They may be known for being some of the world’s most intelligent predators, but even killer whales have their off days, as this slippery sea lion proved.

It looked like curtains for the lucky sea lion, as the three-tonne whale came hurtling up the shoreline.

But with a swift dart to its left, the pup managed to outsmart the giant orca, swimming away to safety and leaving the whale hungry.

The shots were taken in Patagonia, Argentina, by wildlife photographer Pablo Cersosimo, 44.

Mr Cersosimo, who returns to the same peninsula every year to shoot whales’ hunting season, said that a group of wildlife photographers had named the nine-year-old whale Mica, and it just wasn’t her day.

'Watching the most intelligent predator from the sea going full speed out of the water when they hunt is very special. It doesn't matter how many times I’ve seen it or photographed it, the scenario is always different -- there's a lot of adrenaline in the air.

'Sometimes I feel sorry about the sea lion pups because from the very first moments of their lives they face a lot of challenging situations in order to survive -- they are really tough animals.'

Mr Cersosimo said he felt privileged to witness such an important natural occurrence.

'This is a spectacular natural event that only happens in this part of the world, as these orcas have developed a very difficult and dangerous hunting method.' He continued, 'There's a lot of strategy in their action, and some of this orcas work together to capture the sea lions from the shoreline.

'When an orca captures a sea lion, they take it 50 meters offshore, release it and they start playing with it by hitting it with their tales and biting it. The pup tries to escape by reaching the beach the orcas let them arrive very close, sometimes two meters away but then they capture it again. This behavior seems to be cruel, but orcas teach the youngest how to chase and hunt and its the way it has to be in nature. 

But the hardy sea lion didn't seem too perturbed by its near-death experience and was soon back in the waves again.

Mr Cersosimo added: 'Every year I have different chances of shooting these events, but it’s not easy and many times you don't get what you want despite waiting for 10 hours, every day for two months. But on the other hand, it always worth it just to witness such an amazing place.'

Phew! The sea lion heads back into the water to swim another day
