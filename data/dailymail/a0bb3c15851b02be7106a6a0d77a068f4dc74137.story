A woman's world has literally been turned upside down by a rare condition which causes her to see everything the wrong way up.

Council worker Bojana Danilovic, 28, sees everything upside down because of an extremely rare fault in the way her brain processes images.

That means she reads papers from the bottom up and even has special topsy-turvey official forms to fill in for her job at the Uzice town hall in Serbia.

Then when she gets home, she watches one TV balanced on its top while the rest of the family watch another.

'It may look incredible to other people but to me it's completely normal.

'I was born that way. It's just the way I see the world,' said Bojana, an economics expert.

Neurological experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University in the USA say she is suffering from a condition called 'spatial orientation phenomenon'.

'They say my eyes see the images the right way up but my brain changes them.

'But they don't really seem to know exactly how it happens, just that it does and where it happens in my brain,' said Bojana.

'They told me they've seen the case histories of some people who write the way I see, but never someone quite like me,' she added.
