Usually when thieves are caught carrying out their crimes, they are said to be caught red handed, but not this adventurous pickpocket in China.

Instead of using his fingers to grab this man's smartphone from his pocket, he is instead filmed using a pair of chopsticks.

But unfortunately for him his skills don't seem to be up to the task as he quickly drops the mobile, causing the unsuspecting victim to turn around and foil the crime.

Scroll down for video

A man has been caught trying to steal a phone from another man's pocket using chopsticks in China

The video starts with the thief (in black) and the victim (in grey) lounging around on a street corner

As the victim moves towards the wall the criminal moves around behind him and tries to grab his phone

In the short clip the criminal makes several attempts to take the mobile from the man, at first crouching down behind him in order to get into the right pocket of his hoodie.

As the unsuspecting victims moves to lean on a wall the pickpocket has no choice but to follow beside him. He is nearly discovered when the victim moves his arm and almost touches the thief's hand.

Undeterred the man keeps tugging at the phone, but is forced to abandon the attempt after the phone owner turns his head, hiding the sticks under a hat he is carrying to avoid detection and leaving the mobile hanging tantalisingly out of reach.

But he is soon back at it, and after a few more pulls he manages to get the mobile in his grasp, and tries to quickly put it into the hat to avoid getting fingerprints on it.

The thief risks detection with his determined efforts to take the man's mobile away from him

He eventually manages to get the handset, but while trying to slip it into this hat he drops it

But he tries to do it too quickly, and at the last second drops the handset on to the floor, causing a noise which the victim obviously hears as he suddenly turns around.

For a moment the two men stand frozen, as the victim can hardly believe he is looking at his own phone on the floor.

The less-than-master thief pats down his pockets, perhaps trying to pretend that the phone is his, before walking away once the victim has gone in for a closer look.

As the mobile falls to the floor the criminal pats his pockets, as if tying to pretend it was his phone

It is not the first time a chopstick thief has been caught picking pockets in the country.

Back in April last year Wang Hongbo, 32, was snapped lifting the phone from a woman’s pocket as she cycled through Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province.

Photographs show him running after the unsuspecting cyclist along a busy road. The pictures were posted online and after national news coverage, Hongbo handed himself in to the police.
