A teenager who ran onto the pitch during the All-Star game at Citi Field could be jailed for a year and fined $1,000.

Dylan McCue-Masone, 18, of Shirley, on Long Island, has been charged with interfering with a professional sporting event, Queens district attorney Richard Brown said.

McCue-Masone, who allegedly said he would run onto the field if his message on Twitter was retweeted 1,000 times, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment this week.

McCue-Masone, who also faces civil penalties of $5,000, was released without bail and is due back in court on September 11.  He was represented by an attorney from Legal Aid.

The incident began earlier this week when he tweeted: '1,000 RT's and I'll run across the field...'

When the figure reached 300 within an hour, he clearly began to get nervous, and as the number of retweets continued to rise McCue-Masone wrote: 'This is gonna be terrible' before posting 'I hate all of you'.

Once the target was reached, the full scale of his dare dawned on the teenager but he refused to back down.

On his @masonedylan Twitter account, he posted to his followers, of whom there are now some 8,000: 'Alright... i guess have no choice... gonna try to 
get out by left field.'

As Twitter encouraged him to go through with his dare, his mother tried to make him change his mind.

In a message the teenager posted online, she wrote: 'Dylan it's not funny that a serious thing and u could get arrested if not worse please don't b ridiculous'.

In his final tweets before running onto the field, McCue-Masone wrote: 'Blame it on social media, love you all' and then 'If I actually get on the field pray for me cause my mom's gonna kill me.'

His last tweet was a picture from the side of the field and the simple caption 'AHHH'.  The tweets have now been removed from his feed.

In videos of the incident, the teenager 
can be seen running on the field in front of the tens of thousands of 
fans waving his hands in the air.

But security quickly caught up with him and tackled him to the ground before escorting him off the pitch.

McCue-Masone was charged with interfering with a professional sporting event and may now be banned from the ground.

Mets fan Brendan Lane, who was at the game, told NY Daily News: 'People were laughing (when he was on the field) and the climax was when the guy tackles him, aggressively. He tackled him like he had been waiting a long time to tackle someone.'
