A woman has been arrested at Madrid airport after confessing to hiding £70,000 worth of cocaine in her breasts.

The 43-year-old Venezuelan woman used two plastic bags containing 3.75lbs (1.7kg) of cocaine as breast implants to get through customs at the airport in the Spanish capital.

The woman was singled out when she arrived at customs, due to her nervous appearance, but officials found nothing after searching her possessions.

The woman had just arrived on a flight from Bogota, Colombia, and officers took her to one side due to her behaviour as she went through customs at Madrid airport.

Although nothing was found in her luggage, customs officials ordered a full body search.

A frisk by female officers revealed irregularities and deformations in both of the suspect's breasts.

The passenger then 'became nervous and confessed to carrying cocaine implants,' a police statement said Friday.

She was rushed to hospital where doctors removed an implant from each breast, containing a total of 1.7 kilos of cocaine, worth at least £71,000.

Spanish police carry out regular checks on passengers arriving at Madrid's Adolfo Suarez international airport on so-called ‘hot flights’ from Latin America.

Between January 1st and July 15, customs seized 493kg (1087 lbs) of cocaine, believed to be worth around £20million.
