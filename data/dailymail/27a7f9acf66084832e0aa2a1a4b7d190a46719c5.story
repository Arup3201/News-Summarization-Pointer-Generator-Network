A drunk nine-year-old boy brags about smoking weed after claiming to have drunk 18 cans of whisky and cola given to him by his auntie, in a disturbing video clip that has emerged on the internet.

Filmed at a skate park in New Zealand, The Maori youngster is first seen leaning on a wall clutching a can seven per cent strong pre-mixed bourbon and cola before collapsing on the ground.

When the interviewer asks what he is doing drinking a girl on a scooter claims 'he's allowed' and says he had been given the booze by his aunt who lives nearby.

The boy slurs his speech as he clutches hold of a can of seven per cent strong whisky and cola

After staggering around and slurring incomprehensibly the boy moves away sits down with another group of youngsters.

But the interviewer follows him over and asks how many cans he has drunk that day, to which the boy replies '18'.

When the interviewer points out that his aunt could go to jail for supplying him with alcohol the boy begs him not to tell the police.

Risk: The drunken youngster continues to use his scooter seemingly oblivious to the danger

The boy tussles with a girl who said the boy was 'allowed' to drink and had been supplied the alcohol by his aunt

When someone in the background mentions smoking cannabis, the boy says: 'I do smoke weed.'

He
 then walks across the skate park to join a group of older children. 
Among them is a teenager who claims to be the boy's brother and says: 
'He's Maori, he's different'.

Incredibly
 the 'brother' does not seem to be at all concerned about the 
youngster's welfare claiming it is alright and that he was drinking at 
the age of nine also.

After
 the interviewer suggests he could collapse and die from alcohol 
poisoning at any moment the teenager replies: Does he look dead to you?'

As the atmosphere becomes noticeably more aggressive the interviewer and cameraman decide to leave.

When
 police arrived at the scene in Fairfiled, a suburb of the city of 
Hamilton, the boy had disappeared, but they found out where he lived and
 spoke with his mother who was described as being 'distraught'.

A police spokesman said he was appalled that not only had the boy had been supplied with alcohol by an adult but that victimising footage of him drunk had been uploaded to the internet.

A spokesman said: 'I see the drunken activities of adults who one would think could make good choices in life.

'But to have a vulnerable young boy consuming alcohol is very appalling.'

The boys father, who has not been named, told the New Zealand Herald he had separatred from the mother and now had little contact with his son.

He said: 'My heart is ripping out at the moment, I'm trying to hold it together. It's hard.

'I haven't seen my boys in that long, you know, and to have somebody ring me up stating that they've seen my son on YouTube wasted as f***, as it says on there - to me, that's an unfit mother, right there.'

The man who uploaded the footage to the internet said he had done so to highlight the issue.
