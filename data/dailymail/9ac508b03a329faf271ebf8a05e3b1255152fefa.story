A cliff-edge hotel could soon collapse into the sea after authorities decided they couldn't afford the cost of building defences.

The Blue Anchor Hotel, overlooking the cliffs at Minehead, in Somerset, has been forced to close its children's garden play area that backs on to the cliffs which are crumbling at a dangerous rate of a metre a month.

The play area's ship was moved at a cost of £800,000 a year ago to a safer location - one that is now crumbling, as more huge chunks of the beer garden slump onto the beach.

The Blue Anchor Hotel in Minehead could be lost to coastal erosion after funding for a rescue plan was withdrawn by authorities

The hotel has reduced the size of its beer garden due to the erosion with 13ft slipping into the sea in just three months

The regulars joke that they stand on the landward side to even things up.

A plan to build a flood defence wall to keep the hotel from falling into the sea has been abandoned.

In September, a funding bid was made for £570,000 to build a new section of sea wall between the threatened hotel and Watchet.

But West Somerset Council says it is now dropping its bid altogether due to time pressures and a financial risk.

The cliffs at Minehead in Somerset are at risk of collapse by a process called abrasion.

This is when the waves crash against the foot, or the toe of the cliff, and start to erode the soft rock.

As the base of the cliff becomes smaller and weaker, it is no longer able to support the weight above it, and this is when the overhang is at risk of crashing into the sea.

The cliffs at Minehead are red sandstone, and interestingly are harder at the bottom. Three or four metres up the rock is softer as there is less stone content. 

Many cliffs in the south west of the UK are described as 'soft' - often chalky rock or sandstone, whereas many cliffs in the north are granite and described as 'hard'.

The Environment Agency has £570,000 ready to spend extending the sea defences here - but won't spend it unless tiny West Somerset Council provides a consultant's report and pays survey costs.

The council, the smallest in the country, says it cannot afford that, and that the government will need to step in and find the extra funds.

Bridgwater and West Somerset MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said the council's decision was 'utterly ridiculous.

The landlord of the hotel, Simon Strom, said the property lost 13ft of garden in three months last winter and said if the cliff was not shored up the hotel would fall into the sea.

He said: 'I can't do anything.

'All I have got to do is sit here and wait for it to fall in.

'It's just a matter of time before the erosion reaches the hotel.

'It does depend on the high tides and the winters, because obviously we've had a nice summer so the ground has hardened.

'Then you get the high tides, the storms and it just starts cracking again - that's the problem.'

Senior councillor, Anthony Trollope-Bellew, said: 'We have been faced with an impossible combination of circumstances - extraordinarily tight deadlines and substantial financial risks.

'It's not very hopeful for the hotel and everybody at West Somerset Council very much regrets that.

'We have made every effort to help the hotel up till now, but we cannot help anymore I'm afraid.'

The hotel was forced to close its children's play area which backs onto the cliffs and it was moved at a cost of £800,000 - but now that is back in danger

He said the risks included the council having to underwrite the project financially and meet consultation and procurement rules within a stated deadline.

Some £11,500 has already been spent by the local authority on the first stages of the application for Environment Agency money.

Conservative MP Mr Liddell-Grainger said the council's lack of involvement is ridiculous.

'The hotel and possibly the road could go into the sea, which would be a disaster,' he said.

'But the original report that was done by West Somerset Council the Environment Agency quite rightly threw out; it was appalling.

The cliffs that support the Blue Anchor Hotel are made of red sandstone and are being worn away by a coastal erosion process called abrasion 

'So now they have taken the easy route and just said, well if it falls into the sea, it falls into the sea.

'Not acceptable! You cannot have the coastline of West Somerset held hostage by a council that doesn't care.

'I am not prepared to tolerate this shirking of responsibility on such a crucial issue as this and I am taking up the matter immediately at ministerial level with a request that West Somerset be forced to progress the scheme.'

The final decision will be made at a council meeting on December 17, but the recommendation is that the council halts the bidding process.
