Seasonal flow patterns seen by spacecraft orbiting Mars could have been caused by salty water, new research suggests.

Dark, finger-like features appear and extend down some Martian slopes during late spring through summer, fade in winter, and return during the next spring.

Now two U.S.-based researchers have explained how the intriguing dark streaks could have been caused by the melting and subsequent evaporation of frozen salty water.

The lines, first spotted last year by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, lengthen and darken on rocky equator-facing slopes from late spring to early autumn.

Research published at the time said that these seasonal changes suggested that a volatile substance was involved, but the environment is too warm for carbon dioxide frost and too cold for pure water.

Some kind of brine was suggested as fitting the bill, but until now there had been no theories as to what that could consist of.

'We had to find a salt-water mixture that would come and go,' said Vincent Chevrier, a research assistant professor in the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, and lead author of the new study.

Professor Chevrier and co-author 
Edgard Rivera-Valentin, now at Brown University, investigated forms of 
salt known to form on Mars to work out how they could affect the melting
and evaporation points of ice and water.

The director of Nasa's Mars exploration programme says he hopes that one day the rover Curiosity might be brought back to Earth by astronauts.

Doug McCuistion said it was his personal hope that humans would visit the Red Planet in the 2030s or 2040s. He said he could imagine astronauts walking up to Curiosity.

Mr McCuistion said the roving laboratory's mission was scheduled to last two years, but it could have enough power for 20 years.

The Nasa chief set out his vision during a satellite link up with Glenelg in the Scottish Highlands at the weekend. The community of about 280 people has twinned itself with a site on Mars that Nasa has labelled Glenelg - 35 million miles away.

Mr McCuistion said: 'It is my hope that humans will be sent to Mars in the 2030s, or 2040s, and they will be able to walk up to Curiosity and bring it back, as I am sure there is a museum out there that would love to have it.'

Basing their model on soils up to 20cm deep, because beyond that depth the seasonal temperatures would not affect the freezing and melting aspects of the salt-water mixtures, they found calcium chloride fits the bill.

'In one day we could form enough liquid to create these flow features on the surface,' Professor Chevrier said. The model also explained why the flow features disappeared by incorporating evaporation into the model.

'The easier it becomes to melt, the easier it becomes to evaporate,' the professor said. At low concentrations of brine, 'as soon as it melts, it evaporates and disappears.'

The researchers showed that they could melt enough calcium chloride brine so that it would not completely evaporate, thus creating conditions that might explain the flow features.

Their model fits with the seasonal change in flow observations, with the flows occurring on equator facing slopes and with seasonal changes.

Also, high surface evaporation rates as demonstrated in their model explain why, if there is water, it would disappear relatively quickly and why imaging spectrometry on Mars has not identified water signatures.

Mars is now a frozen desert, but geological studies of rocks by previous missions to the surface have suggested the planet used to be warmer and wetter.

Finding water is a first step toward learning whether the environment could support microbes. Scientists generally agree that besides water and an energy source such as the sun, organic carbon is a necessary prerequisite for life.
