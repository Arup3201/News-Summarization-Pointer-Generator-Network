China today executed a man who killed a two-year-old girl by throwing her on the ground following a row with her mother over a parking space.

Han Lei was sentenced to death in September after the incident in which he confronted the child's 
mother in a car park in Beijing, claiming her shopping 
trolley was in his way.

During the altercation in July, he beat the woman to the ground, snatched the child from her buggy and raised her above his head before throwing her to the ground.

Executed: Han Lei was stenced to death for murdering a two-year-old girl in a row with her mother over a parking space

He and a friend in the vehicle then drove away. The toddler died two days later of her injuries, provoking widespread public outrage.

Han was sentenced to death two months after the incident. He appealed against the penalty without success.

He had claimed to have been drunk and told Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court during his trial he believed he was only throwing a trolley to the ground.

He asked for the charge of intentional homicide to be reduced to involuntary homicide, which carries a sentence of between three and seven years instead of a mandatory life sentence.

But China's Supreme Court approved the sentence and he was executed on Friday, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said on a verified microblog account.

Han reportedly told prosecutors last year he felt so guilty and distressed that he wanted to die, according to previous Chinese media reports.

'I caused such a calamity for the child... please make sure that I am sentenced to death,' he was quoted as saying. 'I don't want to live any more.'

Han was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for stealing a car but was released 2012 after the sentence was commuted, the reports said. 

A second man, Li Ming, who drove Han away from the scene, was sentenced to five years in prison for hiding the suspect at the original trial.
