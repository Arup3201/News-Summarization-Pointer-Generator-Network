As police officers searched frantically for a lion on the loose today, others thought they would join in the hunt for the beast by posting their own version of the predator on the internet.

The claims a lion had been spotted near Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, sparked a huge outpouring of humour on social networking site Twitter, with hundreds of users claiming they had spotted the ‘Essex lion’.

A common theme running along the images were scantily-clad women with bouffant hair, heavy make-up and spray-tanned.

Is this the lion? Many Twitter users claimed TOWIE star Gemma Collins, pictured wearing fitting make-up, was actually the lion on the loose as hundreds of users posted their own version of the predator on the site

Animal-lovers also posted pictures of their cute cats and kittens, claiming police were on the look-out for their fury creatures.

Other funny pictures included an iconic picture of Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah running, superimposed on a picture of a lion to look as if he was running away from the beast.

Others superimposed big-hair dos onto pictures of lions – which were then re-tweeted by fellow Twitter followers.

Some people joked stars of The Only Way is Essex were in fact the lion on the loose.

Twitter users said whoever had seen the beast had actually seen the women from the show without make-up or without them brushing their hair.

Several unflattering photos were also uploaded of TOWIE star Gemma Collins, including one of her with lion make-up on while driving a car.

Hannah Bryant said on Twitter: 'Police report: Lion in Essex captured - actually TOWIE'S Gemma Collins after morning spray tan.'

Another Twitter user uploaded a picture of three women scantily clad and tweeted: 'There are far scarier things on the loose in Essex than the escaped lion. We ran in terror from these beasts last night.'

The pictures made a mockery of the sightings yesterday, where residents believed they were 100% sure they had spotted a lion.
