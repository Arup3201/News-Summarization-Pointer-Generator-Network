Dining in Bilbao can easily slip into a game of tapas roulette.

Or perhaps that should be pintxos roulette, as that is what the diminutive plates of bar food are called in this Basque region of northern Spain.

Mrs C is not a seafood connoisseur. I first convinced her to try fish a decade ago - and she has become more daring.

But 'really fishy seafood', as she terms it, remains a challenge, which is problematic here.

Delicious plates of pintxos line every bar. And it's not clear what they contain. And since most of the labels for these dishes are printed in Basque, with its excessive use of the letter x, it becomes almost impossible to tell what you are about to chow down.

Still, it's hard not to love this form of dining - and harder still not to love Bilbao. Everything seems tasteful, with striking sculptures dotted here and there. Even the graffiti on the main bridge in the centre of town looks like it's been considered.

We explore the back streets to the old town, and the fish market (stopping for more pintxos), before heading back to our hotel along the wide riverside path

The modern offices blend in seamlessly with the classic Spanish buildings and large parks, such as at Dona Casilda.

Our hotel - the splendid Gran Domine Bilbao - is a good example of this. Every room has its own work of modern art, and it sits over the road from the Guggenheim Museum.

Opened in 1997, this dazzling titanium, granite and glass shell is a must for devotees of modern art and architecture.

Even before you enter, you are given a taste for the creativity/ bonkers-ness that awaits inside, in the form of the 40 ft topiary Puppy, by Jeff Koons, that sits outside.

Inside hang works by Andy Warhol, Gilbert & George and Wassily Kandinsky.

But it's the enormous rusted 10 ft-high walls of curved metal in the main hall that really catch our imagination. They have been sculpted to form waves that merge to form mazes that you can actually get lost in.

Later that day we take a trip up to the Vizcaya Bridge. This transporter suspension bridge, built in 1893, is 200 ft high and still carries half a million cars and four million people from one side to the other every year in gondolas that hang from steel cables.

It's a staggering work of engineering and is a World Heritage Site. Fares start at about 35 cents - so plenty of change left over for another plate of pintxos.
