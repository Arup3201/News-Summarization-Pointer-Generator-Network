This is the moment a widower made sure his late wife went out with a bang - after turning her ashes into fireworks and blasting her into the sky.

Mother-of-one Annette Maunder, from Plymouth in Devon, came up with the idea with her husband Gary before she died aged 55 from cancer.

Former Royal Marine, Gary, also 55, then fulfilled his soul mate's dying wish by having her ashes piped into rockets and firecrackers.

Annette (pictured left and right with husband Gary) wanted her ashes to be put into fireworks for a send off to remember - and Mr Maunder ensured her dying wish was fulfilled

Annette's friends and family joined him for a special memorial service on Saturday night - culminating with a spectacular two-minute firework display.

The couple from Plymouth, Devon, had been married for 13 years before Annette died on September 11 following a long battle with cancer.

After she was cremated Mr Maunder commissioned the £250 fireworks from Essex-based firm, Heavenly Stars Fireworks. 

Her ashes were fed into gold tails, green peonies, crackling dragon eggs and red and blue chrysanthemum bursts before being launched at Devonport Park in Plymouth on Saturday night in front of friends and family

Her ashes were then fed into gold tails, green peonies, crackling dragon eggs and red and blue chrysanthemum bursts before being launched at Devonport Park in Plymouth.

Mr Maunder said: 'She would have loved it. It's a good way to send her off.

'Our 13 years of marriage was the best 13 years of my life. We won the battle but lost the war. She was a keeper.'

The box of fireworks Mrs Maunder's ashes were piped in to. Fireworks included gold tails, green peonies, crackling dragon eggs and red and blue chrysanthemum bursts before being launched at Devonport Park

Co-op funeral arranger Hayley Pell, who helped organise the display, said: 'In many cultures the funeral is an occasion that brings the whole community together in a grand celebration of a person's life.

'Gary decided to do just that and, with the help of myself, Annette's ashes have been interred into a firework.

'This is a fitting tribute and a great final farewell to Annette.'
