An Observer article that called transsexuals 'bed-wetters in bad wigs' and 'd**** in chick's clothing' has been taken offline after a torrent of abuse from furious readers.

Controversial newspaper Julie Burchill was accused of being transphobic after she wrote a column in the Observer yesterday defending her friend and fellow columnist Suzanne Moore who came under fire on Twitter for an article that said women were under pressure to have bodies like 'Brazilian transsexuals'.

The Observer website was swamped with comments in response to Miss Burchill's column, many describing it as 'vile' and 'horrible'.

Now the paper has spiked the article and issued a statement from editor John Mulholland.

Contrite: The Observer withdrew Ms Burchill's feature and apologised on its website after a storm of protest

It said: 'We have decided to withdraw from publication the Julie Burchill comment piece 'Transsexuals should cut it out'.

'The piece was an attempt to explore contentious issues within what had become a highly-charged debate.

'The Observer is a paper which prides itself on ventilating difficult debates and airing challenging views. On this occasion we got it wrong and in light of the hurt and offence caused I apologise and have made the decision to withdraw the piece.'

But Liberal Democrat minister Lynne 
Featherstone has called for Miss Burchill to be sacked. The
 former Equalities Minister, a staunch supporter of transsexual rights, 
said she should be fired and Mr Mulholland 
should also go.

Miss Featherstone, now Minister for International Development, accused 
Miss Burchill and the Observer of ‘inciting hatred’.

She said on 
Twitter: ‘Julie Burchill rant against transgender community is 
absolutely disgusting – a bigoted vomit for which the Observer should 
sack her.’

Replying to a message saying Mr Mulholland should be sacked, she said: ‘Good point – they can both go!’

Miss Burchill wrote the article in defence of fellow columnist Suzanne Moore, who became the target of transsexuals’ fury over what seemed to be a throw-away comment in a previous article.

Miss Moore, describing the challenges faced by modern women in an article for the New Statesman, had written that modern women were expected to look like ‘Brazilian transsexuals’.

She had said: '(Women]) are angry with ourselves for not being happier, not being loved properly and not having the ideal body shape – that of a Brazilian transsexual.'

The comment provoked fury on Twitter and Miss Moore subsequently said she had been forced to stop using the website because of the abuse she had received.

Miss Burchill ranted: 'Though I imagine (Twitter) to be something akin to being savaged by a dead sheep, as Denis Healey had it of Geoffrey Howe, I nevertheless felt indignant that a woman of such style and substance should be driven from her chosen mode of time-wasting by a bunch of d**** in chicks' clothing.

She added that the reaction of ‘the very vociferous transsexual lobby and their grim groupies’ reminded her ‘of those wretched inner-city kids who shoot another inner-city kid dead in a fast-food shop for not showing them enough “respect”.’

Miss Burchill’s column also compared the attacks on Suzanne Moore to ‘the Black and White Minstrels telling Usain Bolt how to run’.

She added: ‘I must say that my only experience of the trans lobby thus far was hearing about the vile way they have persecuted another of my friends, the veteran women’s rights and anti-domestic violence activist Julie Bindel – picketing events where she is speaking about such minor issues as the rape of children and the trafficking of women just because she refuses to accept that their relationship with their phantom limb is the most pressing problem that women – real and imagined – are facing right now.’

The row started when Suzanne Moore said in a column that modern women were expected to have bodies like 'Brazilian transsexuals'. Brazilian Cristini Couto is pictured posing after she was elected Miss Transexual International in Madrid

Miss Burchill was supported on Twitter by Miss Bindel, who writes for the Observer’s sister paper the Guardian.

She said of her article: ‘This has been a long time coming, the bullying has to stop.’

But not all at the Guardian News & Media were so supportive.

The Guardian website last night published a retort to Miss Burchill’s column by a transgender rights activist.

Entitled ‘Julie Burchill has ended up bullying the trans community’, her article described Miss Burchill’s comments as a ‘list of negative epithets legitimising the currency of hate speech’.

She added: ‘The basic point behind everything she says is that trans people lead essentially inauthentic existences and that hers, as a working-class novelist with a taste for lobster and champagne, is real life.’

Readers also took to the Observer website in their hundreds to complain about Ms Burchill's argument.

Many readers described it as 'vile', 'shameful' and 'disgusting'.

The Observer website version of Ms Burchill's article carried a message that said a number of complaints had been received since its publication.

It said that it is subject to 'an inquiry' by the readers editor.

The message from the Observer readers editor Stephen Pritchard said: 'As you might imagine, I have received many emails protesting about this piece this morning.

'Thank you to those who have written. I will be looking at this issue and will be replying to all in due course.'

A poll of readers on the Independent website following the article saw 90 per cent deem Ms Burchill's article offensive.

Ms Burchill, 53, is a self-confessed 'militant feminist'.

As well as being a journalist from the age of 17, she is also an acclaimed novelist with her 1989 novel Ambition becoming a bestseller.

Her 2004 novel Sugar Rush was adapted for television.
