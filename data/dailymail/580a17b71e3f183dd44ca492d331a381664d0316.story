Diego Costa has made a storming start to life at Chelsea and Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running at Arsenal, but what about the players that Premier League clubs are regretting bringing in?

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 summer signings who have flopped.

Mario Balotelli, Liverpool

£16m from AC Milan

The most obvious candidate for biggest disappointment of the season so far, 'Mad Mario' hasn't had it his own way on his return to England.

Brought in by Brendan Rodgers as a replacement for  Luis Suarez, the former Manchester City striker has played 758 minutes in the Premier League without scoring while looking disinterested.

Liverpool have struggled without Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge this season, and Balotelli's ineptitude on the pitch and attitude off it have done nothing to help their cause.

Eliaquim Mangala, Manchester City

£35m from Porto

When Manchester City signed dominant French centre back Mangala in what was the fifth-biggest transfer of the summer, many thought the champions had fixed their only weakness.

But the 6ft 2in destroyer has struggled to adapt, and has been targeted by so-called lesser teams, especially when captain Vincent Kompany isn't alongside him. He admitted the Premier League was tougher than he ever expected, in an interview withSportsmail's Ian Ladyman last month.

'I would say that playing against Chelsea back at the start wasn't particularly a typical English game, it's the sort of football I'm more used to.'

Brown Ideye, West Brom

£10m from Dynamo Kiev 

West Brom have built their reputation as a relatively prudent side in the Premier League, so when they splashed £10million on a striker, you expect him to fire immediately.

But that just hasn't happened for Brown Ideye, who Alan Irvine admitted he hadn't watched before spending the money on him.

The 26-year-old has scored two goals in 13 games in all competitions and has been linked with a January switch with Sunderland and Newcastle possible destinations.

Facundo Ferreyra, Newcastle

On loan from Shakhtar Donetsk 

Somewhat of a mystery man in English football, the Shakhtar forward was tipped to shine at Newcastle, with Ukrainian fans bemused as to why he was let go.

But the Argentine, nicknamed 'Chucky' has been limited to a handful of Under 21 appearances, and even a change of manager isn't likely to have a baring on his future at St James' Park.

Rio Ferdinand, QPR

Free transfer from Manchester United

Harry Redknapp insisted on Queens Park Rangers signing the experienced defender in the summer after his contract at Old Trafford ran down.

However, after Ferdinand struggled at the start of the season, Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker have been preferred in central defence.

Ferdinand has been fulfilling his punditry duties but this looks likely to be his last season in the Premier League.

Hatem Ben Arfa, Hull City

On loan from Newcastle

At his best, Hatem Ben Arfa is a winger who can trouble even the best defences. But he is most often  a sulky trouble-maker who frustrates his manager.

Steve Bruce didn't see enough from the France international, who believes he can one day win the Ballon d'Or, during his stay at the KC Stadium and cut short his loan.

Newcastle rejected the chance to have him back too, terminating his contract, and Ben Arfa has now penned a deal at Ligue 1 side Nice. 

Michel Vorm, Tottenham

£3.5m plus Gylfi Sigurdsson as Ben Davies also moved from from Swansea to Spurs

Holland international Vorm would have been high up on managers' lists when considering a new No 1 after impressing over two seasons in Wales.

But he has yet to make a Premier League outing for Spurs and has instead had to settle with a place on the bench and Europa League appearances.

Emmanuel Riviere, Newcastle

£6m from Monaco

Newcastle raided Ligue 1 again to sign the French striker, but despite impressing at Monaco, Riviere hasn't scored in 11 Premier League games.

The 24-year-old struggled to lead the line on his own and has been left in the dark by Papiss Cisse and Ayoze Perez this season.

Georgios Samaras, West Brom

Free transfer from Celtic

The Greek striker once went two years without scoring an international goal despite featuring regularly.

So it is perhaps not a surprise that he has yet to hit the target for the Baggies.

Mauro Zarate, West Ham

Undisclosed from Velez 

'He wasn't good enough,' Sam Allardyce replied when asked why Zarate had not featured more for the Hammers, who has now moved on loan to QPR.

The former Birmingham and Lazio frontman seemed to settle in well at the start of the season, but with Andy Carroll returning and Stewart Downing on form, it was obvious the Argentine wasn't going to get the opportunity he craved.
