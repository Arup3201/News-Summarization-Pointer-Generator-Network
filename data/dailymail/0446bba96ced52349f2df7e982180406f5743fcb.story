Matthew Macklin was sore, obviously heartbroken, but gracious in defeat.

A thunderous right hook from Jorge Sebastien Heiland of Argentina had knocked him out in the 10th round of their WBC world middleweight title eliminator at the 3 Arena on Saturday night. He is now left with the unappealing and likely decision to retire without winning a world title.

A student of boxing, he pointed out fighters who had numerous title shots before reaching the summit but also name-checked legends of the sport who fought because they were fighters. He deserves access to that club.

‘Look at the [Jake] LaMottas and all them — they lost many, many times and still went on and won a world title,’ said Macklin in his dressing-room after the fight. ‘How many footballers have bad games? It’s just in boxing you’re as good as your last fight.

‘It’s a shame because now the world title looks further away and maybe it’s just not to be for me. Maybe that fight in Germany will haunt me forever.’

That fight in Germany was a reference to his 2011 points loss to Felix Sturm in Cologne in a WBA world-title fight. He was awarded the decision by German TV pundits that night, but the judges, bafflingly, awarded the win to Sturm.

In hindsight, it was his best opportunity to win a world title, despite the fact that he went on to headline at Madison Square Garden against Sergio Martinez and later challenged pound-for-pound monster Gennady Golovkin.

Now it seems likely that this could be the end for the two-time European champion after his sixth career loss brings his record to 31-6.

Heiland and Macklin went toe to toe for 10 rounds. After a clean left hand landed on Macklin’s chin, that right hook from Heiland left the home fighter on the canvas 42 seconds into the round.

In truth, the Birmingham-born Tipperary man looked every inch of his 32 years from the third round on and the aggregate damage of a pro career which started in his teens made him look, for the first time, a very tired fighter.

‘He was decent and I knew he was good,’ said Macklin of Heiland afterwards. ‘No one wants to admit they’re getting older but the pace of the fight… it probably suited him more than me.’

A constantly busy 27-year-old Heiland was too much to deal with.

‘I’ve got the sort of face where I show every emotion anyway, so I looked tired after a round!” laughed Macklin afterwards, but the 32-year-old is now, undoubtedly, considering retirement. ‘I’ve had tough fights, tough spars and lived in f***ing hotel rooms all over the world! It’s a tough-ish life, but I’ve had more highs than lows, definitely.... I’ll just have to see.’

The unusual predicament Macklin finds will finds himself in is whether to fight on considering there is a possibility that he could yet book an All-Ireland showdown with Limerick’s Lee or a date with England’s Martin Murray.

Promoter Eddie Hearn pinpointed Dublin middleweight Luke Keeler as a star in the making after the 27-year-old demolished Gary Boulden in one round, while he hinted that Cork’s Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan could yet become a major player in the 160lb division after he battered Anthony Fitzgerald inside two minutes. Former amateur stars John Joe Nevin and Tommy McCarthy both recorded early stoppage wins.
