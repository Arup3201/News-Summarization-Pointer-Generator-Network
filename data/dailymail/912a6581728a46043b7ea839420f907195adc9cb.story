Brian Banks says his pre-season debut with the Atlanta Falcons after his rape conviction was overturned was 'better than any roller-coaster ride you can ever get on.'

The 28 year old spent five years in prison and five years on probation following his conviction of rape and kidnapping charges a decade ago.

But now he is free to finally pursue his career as a NFL linebacker because the woman who made the charge when Banks was a 16-year-old high school junior recanted her accusation.

Banks (number 53) on the field, said being back in the game 'is better than any roller-coaster ride you can ever get on'

The conviction was overturned by a California court on May 12, 2012.

Banks, who signed with the Falcons in March, had two tackles in the Falcons' 34-10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday night.

Banks had been trying to get back into football since he was cleared of the conviction.

The Falcons are the first NFL team to sign Banks, but he has had chances with other teams, including the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers and Seattle Seahawks.

He took part in the Seahawks' minicamp last June following workouts in Kansas City and San Diego.

Banks was 16 and had a scholarship offer from USC when a Long Beach Poly high school classmate accused him of the rape.

The woman recanted her claim and offered to help Banks clear his name after he was out of prison.

That helped lead to the conviction being overturned by a California court and Banks' record cleared.

Banks has become a spokesman for the California Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongly accused.

Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a statement in April: 'We
are pleased to have Brian join our team. We had a chance to work him 
out last year and have been monitoring his progress since then.

'He
has worked extremely hard for this chance over the last year and he has
shown us that he is prepared for this opportunity. We are happy that 
Brian will have a chance to live out his dream of playing in the NFL and
we look forward to seeing him on the field.'

Banks spent five years in prison and five years on probation following his conviction of rape and kidnapping charges, which were later overturned

Four months after he was cleared of the charges, the linebacker signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.

Banks was 16 and had just been offered a scholarship to USC when Wanetta Gibson accused him of sexual assault and kidnapping in 2002.

He
was on the way to the school office to talk about his college 
applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went
to a stairwell to make out, his attorney Justin Brooks said.

He
explained that Banks said something to upset Gibson and they parted on 
bad terms. She later accused him of kidnapping her, dragging her across 
the school and raping her in the stairwell.

Investigators
tested her but found no physical evidence of rape, Brooks said. Banks 
maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been 
consensual.

Yet his then-lawyer encouraged the 
promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, 
warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted.

Expecting he would serve just 18 
months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest - and was 
put behind bars for nearly six years - but he never lost sight of his 
NFL dream.

He told ESPN last year that he has been seriously training since October 2011, saying: 'After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.'

He was exonerated in May after Gibson added him as a friend on Facebook when he left prison
with a tag a few months earlier. In a message, she explained she wanted to 'let bygones be 
bygones.'

Brooks said his client met Gibson and caught her on video saying there there had been no kidnap and no 
rape, and would help him clear his record.

Yet she refused to repeat the story to prosecutors as she feared she 
would have to return a $1.5million payment she won after her mother 
brought a suit against Long Beach Schools.

She was quoted as telling Banks: 'I will go through with helping you but
it's like at the same time all that money they gave us, I mean gave me,
I don't want to have to pay it back.'

The Los Angeles Times also reported
that Gibson had been worried the admission would affect her 
relationship with her two young children.

Banks said he would not pursue legal action against his accuser, and Los Angeles 
prosecutors have said it is unlikely Gibson will be charged with making 
false accusations.

After
the exoneration, Banks added: 'My only dream in the world 
is just to be free... For years, I felt like a toy with the switch cut 
off, sitting on the shelf.'
