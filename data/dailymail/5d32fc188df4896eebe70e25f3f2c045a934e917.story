There were mostly treats at the White House this Halloween.

President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama handed out chocolate candies and butter cookies while welcoming thousands of people on Friday. 

The guest list included pint-size superheroes, caped crusaders, princesses, sailors, soldiers and other costumed characters.

More than 4,500 people were expected to participate, including children from military families and area schools. 

Monster Mash, Michael Jackson's Thriller and the Adams Family theme were among songs that blared from speakers as guests walked up the South Lawn driveway.
