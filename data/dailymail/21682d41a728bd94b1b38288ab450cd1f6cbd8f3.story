Amber Vinson's family rushed to her defense today saying the Ebola-stricken nurse would not have boarded flights with symptoms of the deadly virus and put anyone else at risk.

The nurse told her uncle, Lawrence Vinson, that she didn't feel ill until Tuesday morning when she went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital - hours after disembarking her return flight from Cleveland to Dallas, according to a GMA report.

He said on Friday: 'Absolutely not. Amber is one of the most conscientious individuals I know.' 

Mr Vinson said that 29-year-old Amber didn't contact the CDC, despite reports from the agency that she had, because she was not told  to. He added that she had followed the guidelines of self-monitoring her temperature.

Miss Vinson, 29, was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital

Miss Vinson did contact Texas health officials as she had been told to do, who contacted the CDC on her behalf and relayed the information back that she was safe to travel on Monday as her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. 

Miss Vinson, 29, may have been showing symptoms of the deadly virus as early as last Friday - before she flew to Ohio for the weekend and then back to Texas, the CDC claimed on Thursday. 

CDC Dr Chris Braden said: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday.... Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.'

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has a Film Array device, a medical machine that could have detected Ebola in less than an hour.

However, doctors were barred from using the device to check for the disease because it wasn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

US military doctors sent to West Africa to combat Ebola are already using the Film Array, which has more than 90percent accuracy.

The maker of the machine, Utah-based BioFire Diagnostics has received a $240million grant from the Defense Department's Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense to hone the device to detect Ebola and other deadly pathogens.

The device costs $39,000 - a pittance by the standards of medical devices in hospitals - and was developed by Utah-based BioFire Diagnostics to test the genetic markers of a slew of gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. It can use blood or saliva samples and it's proven adept at quickly detecting Ebola, as well. 

The CDC made the shocking announcement after Miss Vinson was revealed as the second nurse in Dallas to contract Ebola from the U.S.'s 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan. 

On October 10, Miss Vinson may have had Ebola symptoms when she flew out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 to Cleveland to plan her upcoming wedding. 

However her mother, Debra Berry, also spoke out to defend Amber saying that much criticism had been thrown at her daughter but that she wasn't sick when she flew to Cleveland. 

Her uncle added that his niece had been given assurances by her employer, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, that she would be protected while caring for Mr Duncan.

He said: 'They [medical staff] were given gear that was supposed to provide isolation, and protocols to follow that they believed would protect them.'

Miss Vinson's family released a statement on Thursday which thanked well-wishers for their prayers and support but also made clear that the 29-year-old nurse had done nothing wrong. 

It read: 'Our family has been overwhelmed with support and love for Amber and our extended family over the last 72 hours, and we thank you for those prayers and well wishes. Amber is stable, and we are continuing to work with her doctors as her treatment progresses.

'Amber is a respected professional and has always had a strong passion for nursing. She followed all of the protocols necessary when treating a patient in Dallas, and right now, she's trusting in her doctors and nurses as she is now the patient.' 

Nina Pham, 26, was the first nurse diagnosed with Ebola this weekend. She spoke on camera from her hospital bed on Thursday to show gratitude to those caring for her after being moved to National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland

Miss Vinson is being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition. 

Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, 42, was treated by two nurses who have since contracted the virus

Chief of Texas Health defended his hospital's protection of their own nurses again on Friday.

Dr Daniel Varga said he wished he could have 'hermetically-sealed' those on the frontline of care for Thomas Duncan - but once again pointed out the hospital had 'been in compliance with CDC guidelines' in protective clothing for their staff.

However he admitted that the hospital was not ready for the challenge of diagnosing Ebola when Mr Duncan first presented with symptoms on September 25.

Dr Varga told GMA:  'We were well-prepared to take care of a patient who walked in holding a sign that says, ''I have Ebola.''

'And a couple weeks ago it was a gentleman walking in off the street with nonspecific symptoms who happened to have Ebola. It's a different concept diagnosing Ebola than being able to treat Ebola, and being prepared to diagnose it.' 

The first nurse diagnosed with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham, was the first caregiver to accept Thomas Duncan when he came up from the ER on September 28, after he was initially sent home. 

Miss Vinson was also one of the nurses to treat Duncan when he was admitted the second time in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea.

Dr Varga said there had been no break in protocol from either of the nurses. 

Miss Pham, who was diagnosed with Ebola this weekend, was flown on Thursday to National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland after initially being treated at Texas Health. 

She is reportedly in a good condition. 

The Frontier Airlines plane that Amber Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday, flies out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. It emerged today that Miss Vinson may have been showing symptoms on her inbound flight to Cleveland
