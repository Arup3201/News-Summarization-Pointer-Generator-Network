Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz will release a book this summer designed to boost his political bona fides in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign.

'A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Miracle of America' will go on sale June 30, joining a raft of other political books penned by other Republicans for the same reason.

Cruz inked a deal with Broadside Books, a division of Harper Collins, last year for a reported $1.5 million advance. 

That would pale in comparison to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's $14 million contract, but signals the publishing industry's eagerness to cash in as political books become more like campaign commercials than memoirs.  

NOW AN AUTHOR: Sen. Ted Cruz, shown on March 2, will likely rail against executive overreach, open borders and the threat of a nuclear Iran in his book due out in June

DISAPPOINTING: Hillary Clinton's memoir made a giant splash in 2014 but sales were well below what her publisher expected for a $14 million advance

Cruz, a first-term lawmaker, told the Associated Press in a recent interview that in a time of 'extraordinary challenges' he wants to tell his story and share his message of free markets and constitutional liberties.

'Men and women are frustrated with career politicians in both parties who are not listening to them,' Cruz told the AP, adding that the themes of a possible White House candidacy are 'certainly reflected in this book.'

Cruz, a favorite among tea party activists who has battled with Democrats and members of his own party, also said he wants to counter the 'caricatures' of the right as 'stupid,' 'evil' or 'crazy.'

'The image created in the mainstream media does not comply with the facts,' he said. 

He said that 'A Time for Truth' will include vignettes about Anwar Sadat, Elie Wiesel and others who 'had the courage'  to speak out even at risk to themselves, a theme he acknowledged can be found in a famous work by a future president, then-Sen. John F. Kennedy's 'Profiles In Courage.'

The vignettes draw upon 'an aspect of what Kennedy did' in his book, Cruz said of 'Profiles in Courage,' a tribute to U.S. senators who took stands unpopular within their own party.

A bipartisan field of possible 2016 candidates will have books on store shelves by the time any primary debates happen.

Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will unveil 'Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey' on May 5. 

Three weeks later Rand Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, will release 'Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America.'

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is waiting until October 6 to introduce 'A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties.'

A few GOP hopefuls have already put their political books out this year, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 'God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy' and Marco Rubio's 'American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone.'

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker released 'Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge' in August 2014, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum published 'Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works' four months earlier.

Carson, who made headlines this week for saying homosexuality is a 'choice' and pointing to prison life for evidence, is the most prolific writer among the likely Republican candidates with eight books to his name already, including four released by the Christian publisher Zondervan.

COTTAGE INDUSTRY: By the time presidential primary debates begin, at least 10 likely candidates – including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee – will have their names on book jackets

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the fundraising standout among Republicans in the early going, published his most recent book, 'Immigration Wars,' in 2013. 

On the Democratic side, Clinton's 'Hard Choices' came out in the summer of 2014 to great fanfare but disappointing sales. At one point The Washington Post declared that it was 'bombing.' 

Her publisher, Simon & Schuster, printed 1 million copies but sold just 161,000 in the first three weeks, a critical marketing period, according to Neilsen BookScan. That number was still under a quarter-million by August.

Elizabeth Warren, seen as a far-left alternative to Clinton if her star should fade, released her own book 'A Fighting Chance' in April 2014.

Cruz's book is scheduled for a June 30 release

That book sold fewer than 72,000 copies in its first four months.

It remains to be seen how Cruz's book will perform, but sales aren't the only motivation for politicians to become authors.

The free publicity is one. Book-signing appearances can take on the flavor of campaign stump speeches, with publishers – not campaign coffers – often footing the bill.

Cruz's campaign referred Daily Mail Online to Harper Collins for comment. A publicist at the company wouldn't comment on the content of the book, describing it as 'under embargo' and saying there would be no advance copies sent to reviewers before the book is finalized and printed.

But the book's pre-order page on Amazon, which still describes it as 'unti' – for 'untitled' – includes a preview from the publisher.

'Liberals love to hate Ted Cruz,' it reads in part. 'The outspoken Texas Senator has a knack for getting under their skin.'

'Since his election to the Senate in 2012 he has refused to go along with the established way of doing business in Washington. As a result, he has become a voice for millions of Americans frustrated with governmental corruption and gridlock.'
