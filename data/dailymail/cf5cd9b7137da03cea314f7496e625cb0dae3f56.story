When 14-year-old Katelyn Norman learned that her bone cancer was going to take her life, she drew up a list of her final wishes - a slow dance, a last kiss, a date to prom.

But as her friends gathered at a venue in LaFollette, Tennessee on Tuesday night to throw the prom in her honour, Katelyn was airlifted to hospital after struggling to breathe.

So classmates and relatives brought the party to her bedside instead, bringing balloons, music and her smartly-dressed date to make sure she didn't miss out on completing her bucket list.

Katelyn has been fighting osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone cancer, for two years but doctors told her last week that it has spread to her heart, arteries, pelvis and spine and that there is nothing more they can do.

Special day: Katelyn Norman, 14, is presented a sash by her date at her prom in hospital on Tuesday night

Dream come true: Her date presents Katelyn, who is suffering from terminal bone cancer, with a corsage

In an extraordinary show of 
courage and determination, Katelyn has drawn up a 
list of activities she hopes she complete before passing away.

Aims on her bucket list include
 having a last slow dance, learning to drive a car, getting a Marilyn 
Monroe piercing, spending a day with each of her three siblings - and attending prom.

Katelyn, who was in stable condition and high spirits on Tuesday night, was pictured grinning as her date bent down to her hospital bed to present her with her corsage.

Outside the hospital, thousands of people lined along Highway 63 as part of a candle-lit vigil for Katelyn, who had insisted that a party continue in her absence.

Celebration: Staff and family members gather for the prom, which was on Katelyn's bucket list

Party: She was supposed to attend a prom in her honour at her school on Tuesday but fell ill earlier in the day

Support: Relatives joined the party, which was a dream for Katelyn before she succumbs to the illness

Personal party: Guests tucked into drinks and cake - which was iced with the theme of the party

'She contacted me and said prom must go 
on, that's her, and you can't help but feed off that energy, that life,'
Sharon Shepard, an instructor at Katelyn's school and prom coordinator, told WATE-TV.

'Once you meet her your life will never be the same, she has such an impact.'

The event, which was held at The Stables in LaFollette, had been personalised for the teenager, with the theme 'Katie in the Sky with Diamonds'.

Friends danced, ate and drank at the party, and posed in front of Italian landscape backdrops - a nod to Katelyn's other dream to visit Italy.

The Campbell County mayor, William 
Bailey, also headed to the prom - where he announced Tuesday - March 26 -
 would be known as 'Katelyn Norman Day'.

Loved: Other friends and community members gathered outside her bedroom window for a vigil

Joy: Katelyn, who has been credited with bringing a community together, looks at the gathering outside

Big day: Katelyn, who has bone cancer, was hospitalised earlier in the day as she struggled to breathe

'We
 wanted to try to make this day, and this time in her life, special to 
her because she makes it special for people in Campbell County,' he 
said.

Her story has spread across social 
networking sites and Kristi Buckner in North Carolina set up a 
fundraising page so the family could afford to carry out Katelyn's last 
wishes.

'Katelyn has touched so many people and has been an inspiration, she has brought an entire community together,' it writes. 'Will you help us fulfill her bucket list?'

Katelyn's mother, Erica Nelson, said they hoped to complete as many activities as possible as she spends her last days at home.

Celebration of a life: Friends and relatives still attended the original party, at Katelyn's request

Candle-lit vigil: Thousands gathered with lights along the streets to celebrate Katelyn's prom

Smiling until the end: Katelyn, now 14, was diagnosed with bone cancer in her arm in May 2011

Healthier days: Friends and family have said that Katelyn is headstrong, upbeat and one-of-a-kind

Dreams on Katelyn's bucket list include:

A last slow dance

Learning to drive a car

A day with each sibling

Seeing Italy

A last kiss

A Marilyn Monroe piercing on her lip

Attending an Of Mice and Men concert and getting an autographed T-shirt

Riding on the back of a motorcycle

'I just want to give her what she isn't 
going to see and just try to fulfill what she wants to do. It's not 
really much, but it's something to her,' she said.

'We're very grateful that they're wanting to come help Katelyn. She's 
touched a lot of people.'

Sharon Shepard, the school nurse at Campbell County High School, where Katelyn attends, told ABC News the teenager is unlike anyone else.

'[Katelyn]
 will change your life,' she said. 'You'll never be the same. She will 
make an impact on you. She's a jewel. My life will never be the same.

'She's
 a fighter. She's just very opinionated and very well-spoken, very 
headstrong, very driven and that's what has gotten her this far.'

Her best friend Brandon Huckaby, 16, added to ABC: 'She's always used her sense of humor 
and her grab on others to push to make everything better for everyone.

Fighting back: On Tuesday she will complete one bucket list item - going to a prom at her school

Staying positive: She has undergone transplants and chemo but the cancer has spread to her heart and spine

'She doesn't care that she's suffering. 
She cares that other people are suffering and she wants to stop that.'

He
 said that, although he's sad about losing his friend, he knows he must 
help her complete her final wishes. 'This is happening,' he said. 'I'm 
getting this done.'

Katelyn was diagnosed with the bone 
cancer in her right arm in May 2011, after a friend punched her arm and 
it went limp. X-rays revealed abnormal bone and she was found to be 
suffering from cancer in her arm and nodules in the lungs.

She has since undergone bone 
transplants, surgeries of tissue ligaments and chemo for her lungs, but 
they have failed to ward off the illness.

Family: She said that her siblings, pictured, are struggling to come to terms with her illness

Upbeat: Her friends and family said she has stayed positive and confident despite her prognosis

Community: Neighbours and groups - including these bikers - have rallied around Katelyn in her last days

Doctors are uncertain exactly how long Katelyn has to live.

'She doesn't let the fact that the 
doctors said she won't last very long bother her,' her friend Brandon said. 'She has an attitude 
that, "I'm Katelyn. I'm bald, I'm beautiful and I will beat this."'
