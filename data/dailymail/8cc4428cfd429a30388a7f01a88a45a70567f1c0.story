Tragedy: Charlie Kelsey-Neil, 12, was found hanging in his bedroom by a younger sibling

A 12-year-old schoolboy accidentally hanged himself in his bedroom just two weeks after jokingly wrapping a cable around his neck in a classroom prank, an inquest heard today.

Charlie Kelsey-Neil, 12, was a big fan of street magician Dynamo who often enjoyed watching the British-born star's TV shows.

An inquest in Medway heard how he was found by a younger sibling at the family home in Canterbury, Kent.

His mother Caroline, 31, and stepfather Jovan Neil, 26, desperately tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead later that evening.

Mr Neil told the inquest the incident was not a cry for help and Charlie had never given any indication of wanting to harm himself.

Mr Neil said that Charlie, who had ADHD,
 loved watching magic tricks and would pretend
 to be Spiderman.

He said: 'He was not interested in looking on the internet, but when he did it was about fishing and magic tricks.

'He became really interested in Dynamo who does street magic.'

The inquest heard Charlies had loosely put an internet cable around his neck and jokingly faked a hanging pose in front of Year 8 classmates just two weeks before his death.

Charlie, a pupil at a school in Canterbury, Kent, was found unconscious at home in Sittingbourne last October.

Patricia Harding, the Coroner for 
Medway, said: 'I totally rule out suicide. There is no evidence he was 
suffering from depression or anything of that sort.

'The evidence shows that it was probable that it was the unintentional consequence of a deliberate action.

'The probable cause of death is that it was an accident. It is a very tragic case.'

After the hearing Charlie's family said: 'Charlie was a lovely boy with a real get up and go personality.He loved the outdoors and would even camp in the garden.

'He was a good brother and very protective of his siblings. He was always there for them and his smile could light up any room.

'All his friends have nothing but good things to say about him and he is sorely missed, we all loved him so much.'

The coroner ruled the schoolboy's death was an accident.
