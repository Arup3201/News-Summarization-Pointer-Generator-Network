Gay couples are racing to pick up marriage licenses in Pennsylvania now that a ban on the practice was struck down Tuesday.

County offices in Philadelphia are staying open late to give out applications. The office in Pittsburgh is taking applications online.

Finding the state's 1996 Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, U.S. District Court Judge John Jones III wrote: 'By virtue of this ruling, same-sex couples who seek to marry in Pennsylvania may do so.'

Pictured: Pennsylvania became the 19th state to legalize gay marriage on Tuesday. In doing so, it joined every other state in the Northeastern U.S.

Judge Jones was confirmed by the U.S. Senate back in 2002, in part at the urging of conservative vocal gay marriage opponent and presidential also-ran Rick Santorum, who was serving his second term as a Senator.

The ruling makes Pennsylvania the 19th U.S. state where gay marriage is allowed, a movement that has gained momentum since the Supreme Court ruled last June that legally married same-sex couples are eligible for federal benefits.

With the addition of Pennsylvania, the all the states of the Northeastern U.S. now allow same-sex marriage.

Most recent court rulings allowing gay marriage have included a stay pending appeal, but Jones' ruling does not.

There is, however, a three-day waiting period for all weddings in Pennsylvania.

The judge noted the issue of gay marriage 'is a divisive one' that makes some people 'deeply uncomfortable.'

'However, that same sex marriage causes discomfort in some does not make its prohibition constitutional,' he wrote. 'Nor can past tradition trump the bedrock constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.'

He compared Pennsylvania's ban on 
same-sex marriage to school segregation laws overturned by the U.S. 
Supreme Court's 1954 landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision.

'We are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history,' he wrote.

The legal challenge to Pennsylvania's Defense of Marriage Law was filed last July by several gay couples.

Challengers
 argued that under the ban, gay couples were denied an inheritance tax 
exemption for surviving spouses and survivor benefits to partners of 
police officers killed in the line of duty.

'This
 is a momentous day for our clients and all same-sex couples in 
Pennsylvania who want to have their love and commitment to each other 
recognized in the same way as that of other couples,' said Reggie 
Shuford, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which
 was involved in the case.

The state has 30 days to decide whether to appeal, the ACLU said.

Plaintiffs: In this July 9, 2013 file photo, the Whitewoods, left to right, Landon, Susan,  Abbey, Katie, and Deb, pose together after a news conference to announce that Deb and Susan are the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit to overturn a state law effectively banning same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania

The
 National Organization for Marriage, which argues marriage is the union 
of a man and a woman, called the ruling 'brazen and unjust' and said it 
would like to see the issue decided by voters.

'The
 ruling unilaterally makes an end-run around the democratic process and 
places the capricious will of one man above the desires of millions of 
citizens,' said Brian Brown, NOM president, in a statement.

Pennsylvania
 Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced after the lawsuit was filed 
that she would not defend the case, prompting calls for impeachment from
 conservative legislators.

On
 Tuesday, Kane tweeted: 'Today, in Pennsylvania, the Constitution 
prevailed. Inequality in any form is unacceptable and it has never stood
 the test of time.'

Governor Tom Corbett appointed William Lamb, a fellow Republican and former prosecutor, to handle the case.

Joe Parisi and Steven Seminelli hurried from work to get their marriage license at Philadelphia City Hall.

Parisi
 says they didn't want to miss their chance. The licenses could be put 
on hold if Republican Gov. Tom Corbett appeals Tuesday's court decision.

Corbett hasn't said if he will appeal.

U.S. District Judge John Jones' ruling calls the same-sex couples who challenged the ban "courageous."

Pennsylvania was the last Northeast state to outlaw gay marriage.
