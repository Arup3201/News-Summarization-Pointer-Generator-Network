With her thick luscious dark brown hair, she was unsurprisingly voted the celebrity with the most desirable locks earlier this year.

But as a new mother, it appeared even the Duchess of Cambridge can forget to touch up her roots from time to time after she displayed a smattering of grey hairs earlier this month.

The grey hairs were long gone this evening however when Kate attended a charity ball with her dark, wavy locks back to their glossy best.

The Duchess appeared to have had her hair darkened and trimmed in preparation for the event

The Duchess looked her usual immaculate self in an elegant off-the-peg Temperley dress paired with Jimmy Choo shoes at the London event.

But it was her hair that sparked the most interest after apparently having undergone a transformation since her other recent outing.

Her hair became the focus at a recent Poppy Appeal event in London when she displayed several grey hairs in her centre parting, while her eyes were also perhaps a little shadowed. 

Many new mothers, like Kate, find that their hair changes after they give birth.

Greying hair is not normally directly associated with pregnancy, however, any form of stress can encourage it and can be a side effect of being pregnant or giving birth.

Kate's visible grey hairs in recent weeks suggested that the Duchess, like many breastfeeding women, had decided not to dye or highlight her hair.

But tonight her hair appeared significantly darker and more bouncy than it has of late. She also appeared to have had an inch or two trimmed from the length.

Kate, 31, left four-month-old baby 
George with daddy at Kensington Palace while she attended the London 
SportsAid ball as patron of the charity, which provides financial support 
for promising young athletes.

According
 to sources Kate normally enhances her sleek hairstyle with an organic 
vegetable-based colour wash and subtle low lights at the Richard Ward 
salon in Chelsea.

Kate's hair has long been the envy of women around the world.

Her thick mahogany locks that never frizz, kink or wisp have, unsurprisingly, become her trademark.

Sources have previously said that the Duchess had, to her horror, started finding the odd 
grey hair (â€˜stress highlightsâ€™, her friends joke) before her pregnancy

In fact, the 'cascading locks' of the former Kate Middleton were voted the celebrity hair other women would most like to have.

Kate's hair was followed closely by the wavy blonde 'elegant and effortless' tresses of Mick Jagger's ex-wife Jerry Hall, and the shiny 'big bouffant' of singer Cheryl Cole.

Model and presenter Kelly Brook, Spice Girl Victoria Beckham and new mum Adele also made it into the top five, while Holly Willoughby just missed out.

The survey, conducted by professional hair product retailer, Fabriah.com, polled 700 of the site's female users and asked them which celebrity hair they would most like to have.

And with Kate's hair back in tip-top shape, it appears she is likely to stay at the top.
