U.S. Marshals have arrested a fugitive wanted for the brutal murders of a family of three in Colorado last month.

Harry Carl Mapps was apprehended Saturday in a late-night raid at the motel room where he was staying in Roland, Oklahoma - 700 miles from the home in Rye, Colorado, where he allegedly killed three friends.

The
 bodies of 51-year-old Reginald Tuttle, his wife, 55-year-old Kim 
Tuttle, and their daughter, 33-year-old Dawn Roderick, were found on November 27 in the ruins of their home outside the small town of Rye.

Police said he shot Mr and Mrs Tuttle in the head and then strangled their daughter, a mother of four, before burning the house down to conceal the evidence.

Mapps, a 59-year-old former long-haul trucker, was a friend of Mr Tuttle and had been staying with him, authorities said. 

U.S. Marshals tracked him to a motel after launching a nationwide manhunt. He has been charged with arson and three counts of first-degree murder.

Roderick lived in nearby Pueblo with her husband and four children and was visiting her parents at the time of the shootings.

No good deed: Police say Mapps, a trucker, was staying with Reginald Tuttle and his wife

‘He took the mother of my children,’ an inconsolable Mark Roderick, Dawn's husband, told CBS Denver. ‘Kind of disbelief. I had never seen him [Mapps] violent, I’ve never even seen him lose his temper, so I’m kind of in disbelief, but just real surprised.’

Taylor said investigators have received hundreds of tips and followed all of them. He said Mapps' last known location was the town of La Junta in southeastern Colorado, where authorities said he cashed a check made out to one of the victims.

An earlier warrant for Mapps' arrest listed charges of theft, identity theft and forgery, all related to the alleged check theft.

Authorities identified Mapps as a suspect in the deaths three days after the fire, but the murder and arson charges were not announced until Thursday. Taylor said the warrants took time to process.

‘The new charges will make him one of the most sought-after fugitives in the country,’ the sheriff said.

‘Law-enforcement agencies nationwide will not want a triple-homicide suspect on the streets.’

The warrant is sealed and no details have been released.

A federal fugitive arrest warrant has also been issued for Mapps, U.S. Marshal John Kammerzell said.

Mapps was initially described as a handyman. His estranged wife, Sandy Mapps, told The Denver Post she ordered him to leave their home in Dimmitt, Texas, last spring. He quit a farm labor job in Texas and moved to Colorado, she said.

Mrs Mapps has been using her Facebook page to spread the message about her husband’s manhunt, posting regular updates on the progress of the investigation.

Fugitive: Mapps is considered armed and dangerous. He was last seen driving a blue 2004 Chevrolet mini-van with the Texas license plate

A $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Mapps’ arrest.
