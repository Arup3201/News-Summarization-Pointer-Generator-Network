The world of football reacted with the same disbelief shared by the rest of the planet while watching Germany's 7-1 humiliation of hosts Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup.

Brazil's dream of winning the tournament in their home country was effectively ended after the Germans scored five goals in the first 29minutes - the fastest time it has ever taken a team to reach that number in World Cup history - on a night when the record books were being rewritten practicallly every time Joachim Low's side touched the ball.

The likes of Theo Walcott, Radamel Falcao and Daniel Sturridge took to social media as the Twittersphere seemed to collectively pinch itself to confirm the shock result was a reality.
