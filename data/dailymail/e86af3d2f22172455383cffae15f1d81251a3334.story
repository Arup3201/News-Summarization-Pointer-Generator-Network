Derby's 12-game unbeaten run was brought to an end as they lost 2-1 at home to Wigan, who came from behind to win for the first time since late August thanks to a James McClean brace.

The Championship leaders went in front through John Eustace after Jack Butland had saved a James Tavernier penalty, but Wigan substitute McClean struck twice from close range in the second half to end Derby's hopes of a club-record seven consecutive clean sheets.

Although Wigan had not won since August 30th, they had drawn their previous four games and there was little in the match until the 31st minute when Roger Espinoza put Callum McManaman in on the left only for Butland to block the midfielder's low drive with his legs.

It started a good period of possession for the visitors but they were almost caught on the break in the 36th minute when Johnny Russell ran away from two defenders down the right to win a corner that went behind off a Derby player.

Another swift attack, this time down the left, created a decent opening for Derby when Jordon Ibe carried the ball across the face of goal before setting up Russell who curled a shot narrowly wide from 20 yards.

Russell was involved in a moment of comedy in the 41st minute when he was barged over by Espinoza and crashed into Wigan boss Uwe Rosler, who was knocked off his feet to the great amusement of the Derby fans.

Rosler also saw the funny side of it but he was not smiling as the first half ended in dramatic fashion with his side missing a penalty before Derby scored in added time.

Derby were stunned when referee Robert Madley gave a handball against Eustace just inside the box, but James Tavernier's spot kick was brilliantly saved by Butland diving to his right. Eustace then went down the other end and opened the scoring when he bundled the ball in after Zak Whitbread flicked on a free-kick.

Although his team were ahead, head coach Steve McClaren made two changes at half-time, replacing Ibe and Will Hughes with Simon Dawkins and Jeff Hendrick, and the latter almost doubled the lead with a 20-yard shot that Scott Carson could only parry in the 56th minute.

Derby went close again in the 67th minute when Craig Bryson's shot deflected off Hendrick and went just wide, but Wigan equalised two minutes later when Espinoza's low ball from the right was turned in from six yards by McClean.

It was the first goal Derby had conceded in 644 minutes and they found themselves trailing seven minutes from time when McClean scored his second of the afternoon from eight yards after Butland could only parry a shot from Adam Forshaw.

Chris Martin curled a free-kick agonisingly wide but Wigan held on through five minutes of stoppage time to repeat last season's win at Derby.
