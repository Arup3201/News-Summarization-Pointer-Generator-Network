The bittersweet moment of saying goodbye to loved ones has been documented by a Cleveland photographer in a new photo series which movingly captures his father’s life and death.

In 2013 Angelo Merendino started taking photographs of his parents waving goodbye on their Akron doorstep after every visit. He didn't realize how poignant the series would become until his father died in May 2014 and his parents joint appearances on the porch slipped away to his mother’s solitary wave farewell.

His photos capture the emotional moment that most of us will experience during the holidays - the combination of happiness at our time spent with loved ones but also our reluctance to see them walk out the door.

Goodbye: Angelo Merendino was touched by how his parents would always come to the door to see him out of their Ohio home

Loving: The couple are always seen grinning and affectionately hugging each other as they wave goodbye

Home for the holidays? The series reflects what many will experience as they travel home for the holidays and eventually have to make those bittersweet goodbyes

‘As long as I can remember my parents have stood by the door and waived goodbye when I would leave. There was never an, "I'll just let myself out," it was always, "We'll walk you to the door,’ Merendino writes on his website.

‘I don't remember when I realized that this goodbye wasn't a given. One day it would be different. Since my dad's passing a mom still comes to the door.’

In a recent interview with Today, the artist spoke out about his grief over the death of his father who died aged 85. He said he feels the photos document how much his parents cared about him and all those who visited the family home.

'I felt like that really told the story of how much they cared," Merendino said. "It wasn't just for me or my brothers and sisters, anyone who's ever come to visit my parents' home were walked out the door. They really cared about people and taught me to care about people.'

Merendino’s personal work is a continuation from his emotional series documenting his late wife’s battle with cancer.

Manners: Merendino recalls how his parents will refuse to let anyone see themselves out - insisting on the proper goodbye 

Lessons: Merendino says his parents taught him how important it was to care for others seen in the simple but moving way in which they welcomed people to and from their home

Not a given: Merendino only decided to share the images when his father died at 85. Looking back it made him realise how moving they are

Supportive: His parents supported him throughout the loss of his wife to cancer and he would in turn support his mother through the loss of his dad

All year round: The pictures show the couple on the doorstep come rain or shine

Shift: The photographs become all the more poignant when they change so Merendino's mother is the only one on the porch not his father

In a series entitled The Battle We Didn’t Choose, Merendino photographs his wife Jennifer in her brave battle with the disease after being diagnosed just five months after their Central Park wedding.

Following her death in December 2011, Merendino moved home to Cleveland from New York to live near his elderly parents.

Their relationship - particularly with his father - drew even closer after the move and in response to Merendino’s heartbreaking experience of losing his wife aged just 40.

The artist told Today he wants his work to remind people to seize the day and remember what matters is their loved ones and to hold them near.

‘I want people to see that life is precious,’ he said. ‘Stop for a minute and say 'I love you' to the people in their life. It's the greatest feeling, to be loved.’

Quoting his wife on his website he writes ‘Love every morsel of the people in your life’.

Angelo Merendino now runs a non-profit organisation The Love You Share to provide financial assistance to women who are being treated for breast cancer.
