An active NAVY Seal and father of three made his college football debut over the weekend.

Tom Hruby, a junior at Northwestern University, took the field on Saturday as the Wildcats faced the Michigan Wolverines, even carrying the American flag as the team entered the stadium.

And as if the fact that a man with a full time job and three children found time to play on a college football team isn't impressive enough, there is also the fact that Hruby is 32-years-old.

Hruby's quest to play for the Wolverines began over the summer, when he participated in the team's three-week training camp to try and score a walk on spot.

Still a SEAL instructor at Great Lakes Naval Station, he saved up his leave to attend the camp, and in the end it paid off, as the defensive end scored a spot on the roster.

Hruby became a SEAL in 2006, and says he has operated in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

It was while in SEAL training that he met his wife Jen, with whom he has three sons all under the age of four; Troy, Ethan and Dean.

A little over a year ago, Hruby decided he wanted to have a Northwestern degree, and began studying for the SATs, having previously attended a junior college.

Once admitted, he and his wife sold their house and moved in with Hruby's mother in Crown Point, Illinois to save money, and now Hruby stays at the dorms during the week and drives to see his family on the weekends.

Practice makes perfect: Hruby saved up his leave so he could attend Northwestern training camp for three weeks over the summer

'Our family really likes to challenge each other, and it’s important to us to aspire to our dreams because I don’t think that you can truly be happy unless you go after those dreams that you think are unattainable,' said his wife Jen. 

It is a lot for one man to handle, and something that is not lost on Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald. 

'I know I couldn’t do it,' Fitzgerald told the Chicago Sun-Times. 

'He’s a man’s man.'

He then said of Hruby's drive, 'He was relentless, absolutely relentless, like you would suspect from a SEAL.' 

Despite all of this however, Hruby remains humble and still driven. 

'I don’t feel like where I’m at today is some outstanding or amazing thing,' said Hruby.

'It’s just more of a challenging route . . . the way I kind of think about finding and accepting and trying to take on these challenges that most people would probably say are impossible, one, or very unlikely or just plain dumb.'

Unfortunately, the Wildcats lost the game, 10 - 9.
