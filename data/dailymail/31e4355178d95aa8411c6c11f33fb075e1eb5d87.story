His political career may have hit the doldrums but the public can rely on the ever-resilient Anthony Weiner to grasp on to any silver lining of his waning fame.

In his latest comeback, the disgraced former congressman, who made a failed attempt for New York mayor last year, will appear as himself in the final episode of web series Alpha House, it was confirmed today.

The show, an original by Amazon.com, depicts four senators who live in a frat-style house in Washington D.C. and stars Bill Murray and John Goodman.

He's back! Anthony Weiner makes a cameo appearance in the final episode of web series Alpha House

The Alpha House, starring from left, Matt Malloy, Clark Johnson, John Goodman and Mark Consuelos, is an original series by Amazon and has had positive reviews

Weiner joins a cast of real-life politicos making cameos including former GOP head Michael Steele, CNN analyst and Supreme Court guru Jeffrey Toobin and former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw.

It is a brief moment in the spotlight for Weiner who has kept a relatively low profile since crashing out of the race for City Hall.

At the end of 2013, Weiner took to social media to hint at a comeback.

The politician, whose embarrassing 
sexting scandals saw him resign from Congress in 2011 and lose the 
mayoral election, wrote on his Facebook page that he 'hopes to
 keep the band together'.

'What's next? I'll keep you posted on my plans. But I hope we keep the band together,' he wrote, noting that 2013 'didn't go as I had hoped'.

The Democrat became a national joke 
after explicit images he sent to various young women under the alias 
'Carlos Danger' were made public.

Alpha House, which has had thumbs-up from critics, is based on a home in the capital known as 'The Omega House' shared by Senators Dick Durbin from Illinois and Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative George Miller from California.

CNN went inside the house where the political heavyweights live on bowls of cereal, don't make their beds and haven't updated the music collection since Jackson Browne topped the charts.

They are all Democrats, unlike the politicians in the web series who are Republicans.
