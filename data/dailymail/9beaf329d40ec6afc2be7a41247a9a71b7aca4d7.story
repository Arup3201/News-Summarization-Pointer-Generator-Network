A tragic tortoise is battling a severe bout of constipation after swallowing a lucky charm the shape of a turtle. 

Lola, a large Sulcata tortoise, was taken to the vets on Monday afternoon after  her owners noticed she was unwell.

Dr Harris at Avian & Exotic Animal Centre, in Miami, immediately sent the creature for an x-ray to determine what was causing the blockage. 

 Blockage: An x-ray scan of Lola the tortoise shows the turtle-shaped pendant lodged in her digestive tract 

Squeeze: Poor Lola was left with terrible constipation after swallowing the pendant 

The medical expert was then left stunned after discovering Lola had swallowed a small metal pendant in the shape of a turtle. 

The small piece of jewelry had caused a blockage in the 10-year-old amphibians digestive tract preventing it from passing any stool. 

Lola is now being treated at the vet's office with enemas and laxatives in hopes she'll pass the charm on her own. 

But if she doesn't pass the sea turtle charm on her own she will have to be taken for emergency surgery.
