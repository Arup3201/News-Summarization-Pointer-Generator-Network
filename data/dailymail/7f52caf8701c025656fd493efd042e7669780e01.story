The Government yesterday issued a glowing report on the Olympics coming in under budget – despite the cost being almost four times the original estimate.

Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson said it was a ‘significant achievement’ that spending on the 2012 Games was expected to come in £476million under its £9.3billion budget.

But his boast was declared ‘disingenuous’ by critics, who pointed to the initial estimate of £2.4billion made by the Labour Government when London won the bid in 2005.

This had ballooned to £9.325billion by 2007, leading to claims that the public was duped over the true cost – or that an overly generous budget had been created to ensure it would not be exceeded.

Nevertheless, Mr Robertson used the final quarterly update on Olympic finances before the London Games to say: ‘The project is in an extraordinarily good place financially.

'We are in the process of delivering the largest logistical exercise outside a major war and we have done it on time and under budget, and that’s a fantastic calling card for this country.’

He added that there was a 
‘recognition right from the word go that [the £2.4billion estimate] 
would have to change dramatically on the basis of delivering the Games’.

The figure did not include costs for security, VAT, the regeneration of East London or contingency funds.

Yesterday also saw the disclosure that a further £19million would be spent on security.

The
 decision was made after ministers were ‘surprised’ at the huge turnout 
for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant, which saw 1.2million 
people line the banks of the Thames despite poor weather.

The
 scenes sparked fears of over-crowding during the Games, particularly 
around the cycling road races during the opening weekend.

The
 Government has already revised  the cost of security once, allocating 
an extra £271million to almost double the initial £282million put aside 
after the organising committee said it needed thousands more security 
guards.

'Disingenuous': Olympics minister Hugh Robertson

Providing details of the 
penultimate day of the relay on July 26, they said 175 torchbearers 
would take the flame from Camden in north London to Westminster via 
Downing Street and Buckingham Palace.   

Queen Elizabeth is due to 
open the Games on July 27, when a cauldron will be lit at the Olympic 
Stadium in east London, in what will also be a family affair.   

Her
 daughter Princess Anne is president of the British Olympic Association 
while grand-daughter Zara Phillips has been nominated to compete for the
 Team GB equestrian squad. 

The flame will also visit St Paul's Cathedral, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, pass Battersea Dogs Home and travel to the site of the 1908 Olympic Stadium in White City on the penultimate day.   

The torch relay is currently in Scotland on the 27th day of a tour around Britain.    

Yesterday thousands of people lined the streets of Scotland's capital to greet the Olympic Flame on its last full day north of the border.

Thirteen-year-old Joseph Forrester, trailed by 20 schoolchildren, carried the torch along West Sands beach in St Andrews to recreate the opening scene of Chariots of Fire.

The 1981 film opens with a classic scene of British runners churning through waves and sand to the soaring strains of music by Vangelis.

The title of the film comes from a refrain in the classic Christian hymn Jerusalem, which is sung later in the film.

In Edinburgh, onlookers crowded into the top of the Royal Mile to catch a glimpse of the flame, while thousands more took their seats at the Castle Esplanade for an outdoor celebration and concert.

Pop singer Emeli Sande headlined the event, which also featured acrobatic performances, dance displays and community acts.

The musician performed a selection of her new songs and well-known hits, including Heaven and Next to Me.

The torch was taken into the arena by Lesley Forrest, who lit a cauldron on stage towards the end of the show.

Ms Forrest, 54, received a kidney transplant in 1996 and went on to become a multiple medallist in both the British and World Transplant Games.

Reflecting on the experience, she said: 'I was getting to the point where it was quite emotional and I thought I would have a few tears, but the crowd just brings you along and I was just so overwhelmed and excited about it all.

'I think the torch has really pulled all the communities together; you just have to look at Edinburgh today. I think it's gathered momentum and everybody now will be watching the Olympics.'

Today the Olympic torch is making its way south after taking in some of Scotland's most famous landmarks during a week-long tour.

The day's first torchbearer was 16-year-old Raquel Matos from Edinburgh, who started the flame at the city's Festival Square. She was nominated for her swimming achievements.

Many schoolchildren waited on the Royal Mile for a glimpse of the flame as it was carried by wheelchair user Sally Hyder along with her assistance dog Harmony, from Canongate Kirk to Holyrood.

The 49-year-old, from Edinburgh, has multiple sclerosis and was nominated for the work she does to promote the charity Canine Partners.

Finally torchbearers will run around Alnwick, Northumberland, and end their relay at the town's castle.

The Olympic Torch arrived in Scotland on June 7 by ferry from Northern Ireland and set off the next day.
