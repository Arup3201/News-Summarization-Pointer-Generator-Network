A three-week old kitten survived a 1,000 mile journey across two US states inside the engine of a car.

The cat was only discovered after the driver heard it meowing while driving from Oregon to California.

Police were called but were unable to find it and the kitten was eventually freed by an animal rescue charity after being trapped for two to three days.

The kitten survived a two-day 1,000 mile journey across two US states before being rescued

Speaking to ABC News, Julia Di Sieno, the founder of Animal Rescue Team, Inc., said the car's owner first called her last week.

She said: 'She heard the kitten crying before she departed and there was nothing she could do. She tried to find the kitten. So they continued on their journey, driving south.'

But the owner called her again the following day to say she thought the kitten, a stray, was trapped somewhere in the car.

Miss Di Sieno said she asked the owner to call the Santa Barbara police department and ask them to call animal control.

The kitten is thought to have been trapped inside the engine compartment for two to three days

The driver heard the kitten - a stray - meowing while driving 1,000 miles from Oregon to California

She added: 'Animal control was dispatched, an officer showed up, and he thought perhaps the kitten was no longer in the compartment.'

But that afternoon Miss Di Sieno got another call saying she could still hear the cat meowing. Miss Di Sieno added: 'I had to go do something.'

She drove to meet the owner. At first, they struggled to find the kitten - even after they had lifted up the car to look underneath with the help of a tow truck company - but then found it hidden away in the silver Honda Fit's engine compartment.

She managed to sedate the cat with a 'jab stick' and was then able to manouevre it out of the engine.

Miss Di Sieno said: 'I was concerned about this kitten because it had been in the car engine for two to three days.

'I put on latex gloves, and I managed to get my hands in there until I had a little kitten and wiggled it through.'

The rescuers managed to remove the kitten by sedating it and then pulling it out carefully

The kitten, which was dehydrated and had an infected eye, is now expected to make a full recovery

Miss Di Sieno then took the kitten, who was dehydrated and had an infected eye, home to give it treatment.

It is now expected to make a full recovery.

Miss Di Sieno added: 'He is very tame now, purring, and finally eating. We’ve been treating him with antibiotics.'

Miss Di Sieno has been saving animals for more than 29 years at Animal Rescue Team, Inc., sustained solely by donations.

She has rescued lions, bears and other large mammals, but she said this was the first time she’s rescued a kitten from an engine.

She said: 'It was refreshing for me because I’m passionate about this work and saving animals. The moment I pulled him up, it was so exhilarating.'

She added that, for a lost kitten, an engine is a perfect small, tight compartment to seek warmth, especially if it was in a climate such as Oregon.

The cat has now been named 'Love' after the owner of the tow truck company, who helped free the kitten without asking for payment.
