Two fishermen captured scenes of sharks feeding in British waters worthy of the film classic Jaws - all for just £5.

Instead of using high-tech safety equipment, the pair risked life and limb by shot the never-before-seen footage from the inside of a converted laundry trolley.

Martin Bowler, 41, and Michael Jackson, 46, said they pushed their luck 'as far as we could' as they whipped the blue and porbeagle sharks into a feeding frenzy.

Dangerous: Michael Jackson was lowered into the water among dozens of sharks in just a converted laundry trolley

Damaged: The cage, which was picked up for free from a scrapyard, has been bent after an eight foot blue shark charged at Mr Jackson

The unique footage has been added to an independent DVD about the underwater filming of fish in their natural environment.

Mr Jackson, who was in the cage, 
experienced one nerve-wracking moment when an aggressive eight-foot-long 
blue shark rammed into the front of the trolley, making a large dent in 
it.

The pair, from Wiltshire, planned the 
dangerous shoot so they could be the first to film the lethal sharks in 
that state in British waters.

Mr Bowler, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, admitted they had concerns about the safety of Mr Jackson.

He said: 'We did ask ourselves how safe Michael would be in the cage.

'We couldn’t afford to do proper health and safety checks but we did a risk assessment beforehand and we decided to risk it.'

They recovered a 6ft tall, three-sided metal trolley for free from a scrapyard to use as a 'shark proof' cage.

The trolley was then fixed to the back a boat using a 30ft bungee rope, which they already owned.

Chicken wire - the only item they had 
to pay for - was wrapped around the front for added protection and three
 large floats were placed underneath to give it buoyancy.

They charted a fishing boat to the 
Celtic Deeps, an area where the Atlantic, English Channel and Irish Sea 
merge about 30 miles off the Cornish coast.

It is brimming with sharks that are said to be venturing further north in the hunt for food.

Mr Jackson climbed into the cage wearing a wetsuit and snorkel and carrying a water-proof HD video camera.

They baited the area with ‘chum’ - a 
mixture of fish heads and guts - to attract numerous blue and porbeagle 
sharks and whip them into a feeding frenzy.

Mr Bowler said: 'We knew that nobody 
had climbed into the water to film sharks while baiting up in British 
waters before and wanted to be the first.

'Michael and I are self-employed fishermen and we don’t have much of a budget.

'There was no way we could afford our own shark cage or hire one so we decided to improvise as best we could.

'We picked up an old linen trolley from a scrapyard that is made of metal and weighs about 75lbs.

'It only had three sides so we used 
some wire on the front up to waist height. That enabled Michael to lean 
out of the cage and fend off the sharks with the video camera.

'We put three floats on top of it to give the cage buoyancy.'

After baiting the water up, the two 
men were joined by half a dozen porbeagle and blue sharks that measured 
up to 8ft in length and weighed about 180lbs.

Mr Bowler said: 'Sharks are quite 
placid but some, like blue sharks, can be very aggressive and dangerous 
when there is blood in the water.

'Michael climbed into the cage which then drifted about 20ft off the boat.

'We whipped the sharks up into a feeding frenzy and Michael set about filming.

'He got some great footage and some of
 the sharks got really close to him. One blue shark got too close and 
barged the front of cage.

'I’m quite certain that in that state, it would have had your arm if it tried.

'We were delighted with the footage we got but we won’t be doing it again as we felt we had pushed our luck as far as we could.'
