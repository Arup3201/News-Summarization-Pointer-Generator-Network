Roy Hodgson has reassured Ross Barkley that he has a big future with the national team after he played just four minutes against Scotland as a substitute and failed to get on the pitch against Slovenia.

Last weekend his Everton manager Roberto Martinez claimed Barkley, 20, can be the best player in the history of the national team.

Hodgson said: ‘I am not uncertain about him. Barkley has only just come back from a long injury.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez thinks Barkley can be the best player in the history of the national team 

‘He is an outstanding talent and a part of our thoughts going forward.

‘But at this particular point in time, I think he, like Theo Walcott, needs a few more games to help him.

‘I have no doubt that will happen and that in future he will give us another interesting option in terms of team formation. We like him very much.’
