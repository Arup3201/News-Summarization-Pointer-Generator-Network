It took a special goal from Oscar and an Eden Hazard penalty for Premier League leaders Chelsea to claim three points from west London rivals QPR at Stamford Bridge.

Diego Costa returned from injury after four games out but it was Oscar's stunner that gave the hosts the lead in the 32nd minute. QPR equalised via a clever  Charlie Austin finish threatening a draw in Jose Mourinho's first derby against QPR, but Hazard was on hand to secure the win in the 75th minute.

Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan was at Stamford Bridge and rates the players' performances.  

Oscar was the main man for Chelsea with a stunning strike and continues to improve with each appearance

CHELSEA

Thibaut Courtois - 6.5

Very, very little to do, but questionable whether he should have punched for the QPR equaliser. Other than that, caught well, organised the back four and was quick to distribute.

Branislav Ivanovic - 7

Guilty of missing an early sitter, but was solid defensively. Junior Hoilett didn’t get any change out of the Serbian and wasn’t able to affect proceedings.

John Terry - 7

Strong in the air and - as ever - assured when coming out of the back four. Helped that QPR only opted for one up front, but you can only dominate what’s put in front of you.

Gary Cahill - 7

See Terry. Calm and assured but for one moment in the first half when Charlie Austin headed over the top.

Filipe Luis - 7

Eduardo Vargas is a tricky customer but he stood up to him with varying success. Doesn’t look like someone who has played in a Champions League final, though.

Nemanja Matic - 8

Peerless, yet again. Isn’t handed the plaudits the flair players are for obvious reasons, but there isn’t a better midfielder ahead of a back four in the Premier League.

Nemanja Matic was immense again in the Chelsea midfield

Cesc Fabregas - 7.5

Knits, threads and gives the Blues an impetus they lacked last season. Consistent in his performances and seems to register an assist every week.

Willian - 7.5

Becoming a devilish to play against. Happy to flit inside off his wing to influence the game but is equally adept at beating a man at the byline as he managed to great effect.

Oscar - 8.5

Absolutely marvellous finish for the first goal, curling an effort with the outside of his foot beyond Rob Green from 18 yards. Gets better each week.

Eden Hazard - 7.5

Hasn’t come under fire for his form this season as such, but Hazard is yet to hit the heights of last year. Good here, jinking and weaving on the edge of the box. Won and then scored the penalty.

Diego Costa - 7

His mere presence is enough to strike fear among visiting defenders. Hold-up play was its usual bustling brilliant.

Subs

Didier Drogba (for Willian, 64mins): Back to his normal self, haring around the Bridge. 6

Andre Schurrle (for Costa, 78mins): Had one stinging effort well saved by Green. 6.5

Ramires (for Hazard, 90mins): Timewasting substitution.

QPR

Rob Green - 7

Made a number of smart saves. No fumbles and kicked well. Has had to up his game with the emergence of Alex McCarthy.

Mauricio Isla - 6.5

Faced his toughest direct test since joining the club in Eden Hazard and - although the South American was dumbfound on occasion - stuck to his guns.

Steven Caulker - 6

The clamour for an England call-up seems like a lifetime ago now. May be good enough to keep the Rs in the division but up against Diego Costa? Not quite there.

Richard Dunne - 6.5

Surprisingly, Harry Redknapp didn’t have his back four stationed deep. That was potentially a recipe for disaster for Dunne, but the captain performed admirably.

Yun Suk-Young - 5

Given a torrid time at left back; Willian ran him ragged and he looked out of his depth. Began to get forward more after half-time.

Eduardo Vargas - 7

Could be the man to keep QPR in this division. Has that driving ability with the ball you need to worry defenders. Just a shame that he was stuck out on the right here and it’s not in his nature to help defensively. Slightly unfortunate in conceding the penalty.

Eduardo Vargas was unfortunate to concede the penalty for the winner and was stuck out on the right

Karl Henry - 7

Chelsea did have a lot of the ball, but Henry kept his discipline well throughout. Always showing for the ball.

Sandro - 6

Fairly anonymous but for a deflected second half effor, which is no bad thing for a man sitting. Failed to utilise his range of passing effectively - all the more galling given the speed of Rangers’ wide men.

Leroy Fer - 7

Big strong runs from the middle of the park as he tried to offer support to Charlie Austin.

Junior Hoilett - 5.5

Barely got a kick up against Ivanovic and tends to hide when things aren’t going his way.

Charlie Austin - 7.5

Thankless task up there on his own. Tried his best to ruffle the feathers of Cahill and Terry and linked up nicely in spells. Excellently-improvised flicked finish for the equaliser.

Subs

Bobby Zamora (for Hoilett, 60mins): Wins almost every header and offers Redknapp an out-ball, particularly when they’re chasing games. 6.5

Armand Traore (for Fer, 84mins): Tried to give Rangers extra width in search of a late equaliser. 6
