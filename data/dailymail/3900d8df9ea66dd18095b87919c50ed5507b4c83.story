A Good Samaritan who stopped to help Clarke Carlisle after he jumped in front of a lorry has been left so traumatised that he has been forced to quit his job.

Chris Kilbride was driving along the A64 near York on his way to work when the former footballer launched himself into the path of an oncoming lorry in a bid to take his own life.

The 24-year-old was forced to swerve to avoid the sports star, as he lay fighting for his life in the middle of the road. He then rushed to his side and phoned 999.

Chris Kilbride, 24, (left) has revealed how he stopped to help Clarke Carlisle (right) after he attempted to end his life by jumping in front of a lorry on the A64 near York in December 

But the father-of-two revealed today how the terrifying incident has left him in a 'dark place', which includes flashbacks and nightmares.

He says he is so disturbed about what happened that he cannot drive past the same spot, meaning he has had to give up his work.

He also told how he made a promise - while tending to Carlisle - to try and meet him, should he ever pulled through from the horrific crash. At the time, he did not know who the man.

He told the Sunday People: 'I can't believe he ­survived. I expected him to pass away. 

'I said to myself, "If he survives I would like to meet the man". I don't have any hatred towards him. He did what he did because he was in a bad place.

'But the consequences of his actions have now put me in a similar place. I'm not angry at him.

'Everyone deals with things differently. But because he did that, I've now got to deal with it.' 

Carlisle, the former Leeds, Burnley and QPR defender, bravely revealed earlier this year how he jumped in front of the lorry in December in a failed suicide attempt. 

Carlisle was recently released from hospital. six weeks after he was injured in the collision with a lorry

The 35-year-old had previously spoken about how he had struggled with mounting depression and a sense of worthlessness after he retired from professional sport in 2013.

He attempted to build a career as a pundit but lost a £100,000 role with ITV. He was then arrested for drink-driving just 36 hours before his suicide attempt. 

Carlisle was critically injured during the collision and was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary.

He finally returned home from hospital earlier this year, after suffering internal bleeding, a broken rib and cuts and bruises.

Today, Mr Kilbride described how he rushed to Carlisle's side as he lay in the middle of the road, in a pool of blood. 

Clarke Carlisle's wife Gemma has spoken of her horror at witnessing the former footballer's injuries after he jumped in front of a lorry. The pair are pictured together in 2013

He told how instinct kicked in and that he immediately leapt out of his car to phone an ambulance.

He described how Carlisle was so still that he believed he was was dead. But he then saw Carlisle's arm move and realised he was conscious. 

Another passer-by then stopped to help and Mr Kilbride continued talking to the call handler.

When the police arrived, he says he went to comfort the lorry driver, who was 'hysterical' and also had glass in his eye.

A few hours later, he received a voicemail from the lorry driver's wife, thanking him for comforting her husband. 

Meanwhile, the footballer's wife Gemma Carlisle had previously told how she begged her husband not to die as he lay disfigured in a hospital bed because she was 'too young to be a widow'.

Brave: The former Leeds, Burnley and QPR defender has spoken about his depression in the past

He suffered internal bleeding, a broken rib and cuts and bruises following the incident in December 

Recalling her first visit to see him in hospital, she said: 'Nothing could prepare me for what I saw. There was so much blood. It was everywhere.

'I went to hold his hand but his hands and his arms had bits hanging off. I remember saying to him "don’t you dare die, please get better, please live". I thought I'm too young to be a widow.'

She told how she had Carlisle missing two days before the collision and tried desperately to contact him through his mobile but had only managed to reach the answer phone every time.

When officers knocked on her door to reveal he had been found, she was taken in a police car to hospital and could see the helicopter that was carrying her husband.

Earlier this week, Twitter users had leapt to Carlisle's defence  after actor Ralf Little accused his former friend of not telling the 'full story'.

The Royle Family star was branded 'crass' and 'insensitive' for tweeting that Carlisle was going to 'get away with it again' in reference to his interview about his battle with depression.

The actor had earlier tweeted a picture of the article, commenting: 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN. #Teflon #nonstick.'

He also wrote: 'Seems people want context about previous tweet. So let me say, I know the full story and it's not what's portrayed in the media. That's all.' 

The pair had become friends in the early 2000s, but are thought to have fallen out when Carlisle took the actor's bank card to fill Little's car with petrol.

Instead, according to Carlisle's autobiography, he used the card to fund a drinking spree.

Little did not refer to the incident, thought to have taken place in 2003, but admitted he should not have used a forum such as Twitter to make the comment.
