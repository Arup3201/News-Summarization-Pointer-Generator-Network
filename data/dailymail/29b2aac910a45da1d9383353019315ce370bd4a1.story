Karim Bellarabi scored the quickest goal in Bundesliga history and then set up another for Stefan Kiessling as Bayer Leverkusen stunned hosts Borussia Dortmund with a 2-0 win on Saturday evening.

Bellarabi struck after only nine seconds, beating the previous quickest goals scored by Giovane Elber and Ulf Kirsten by two seconds to leave the Westfalenstadion shellshocked.

He then teed up Kiessling for the second deep into second-half stoppage time with Leverkusen proving to be good value for their win in Roger Schmidt's first game in charge.

Off the mark: It did not take long for Bellarabi to score his side's first goal of the new Bundesliga campaign

Hannover came from behind to beat Schalke 2-1 to increase the pressure on the Royal Blues' coach Jens Keller. 

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar gave the visitors the lead within two minutes of the half-time interval after a dreary first 45 minutes at the Niedersachsenstadion.

But two goals in three minutes from Edgar Prib and Joselu turned the game on its head, earning Hannover all three points and condemning Schalke to a second defeat in a week, after they lost to Dynamo Dresden in the first round of the DFB-Pokal.

The Bundesliga season may only be a day old, but already Keller will have to listen to speculation over his future.

Goalscorer: Former Real Madrid striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar gave his side the lead

Julian Schieber's fourth brace of his top-flight career was not enough to earn Hertha Berlin victory as they surrendered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Werder Bremen at the Olympiastadion.

The former Borussia Dortmund forward gave the hosts what seemed to be a comfortable lead with goals in either half, but Assani Lukimya and Franco Di Santo scored two goals in as many minutes to earn Robin Dutt's men a share of the spoils.

Hoffenheim began their campaign with a 2-0 win over Augsburg as Adam Szalai marked his debut with a goal before Tarik Elyounoussi added a second just two minutes later.

Haris Seferovic scored the only goal for Eintracht Frankfurt as they beat Freiburg 1-0, while Cologne and Hamburg began their league season with a goalless draw.
