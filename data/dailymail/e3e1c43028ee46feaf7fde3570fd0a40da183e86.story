Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has turned to Twitter to help find an earring she lost on Monday morning before doing a live TV interview.

Ms Bishop appeared live in the Sky News studio in Sydney's Martin Place with one pearl earring noticeably missing.

Later on Monday morning she tweeted: 'Hi Twitter I lost earring in Martin Place today - if found grateful contact me 02 62777500.'

Ms Bishop appeared on Sky to talk about the Bali Nine members on death row in Indonesia and an asylum seeker hunger strike on Manus Island.

Ms Bishop may be one of the most powerful women in Australia but she often uses her Twitter account to show a more personal side. 

The Foreign Minister took to Twitter on Christmas morning to wish everyone a happy holiday with the help of a few emojis. 

Her message included Christmas trees, presents, Santa Claus, family and music.

Many humorously opted to relate Ms Bishop's tweet to same-sex marriage equality after she included emojis of two women and two men holding hands. 

The earrings are a favourite pair of the foreign minister's - she has been seen wearing them numerous times

'@JulieBishopMP I like how you have included same sex couple emojis in your Christmas tweet #marriageequality #auspol,' one person tweeted. 

'Nobody tell Julie that these aren't brothers and sisters,' another wrote. 

It wasn't the first time the politician took over Twitter with emojis.

She spent three hours replying to her thousands of Twitter followers using nothing but the small pictures last year.

Ms Bishop's popularity has doubled in recent months ranking her on par with the prime minister as preferred Liberal leader and she was named 'Woman of the Year' by Harper's Bazaar magazine in November.

The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security last year.

Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin  at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.

The Foreign Minister was further regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies.  

Ms Bishop was also listed as one of the 50 most powerful women in Australia of 2014 by the Australian Women's Weekly.

She told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'living then dream and loving the job'. 

'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said. 'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.' 

The 58-year-old politician is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits

Ms Bishop revealed due to high demanding job, she only gets four hours sleep a night but still manages to fit in a workout each day. 

While she famously wears Giorgio Armani suits and has a love for pearl necklaces, a departmental document reveals many of the other requests that follow Ms Bishop all over the world in her role as Foreign Minister. 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document contains insider information on her non-stop professional life and personal preferences when travelling.

The note shows that Ms Bishop leads a healthy lifestyle, saying that she is a 'non-smoker', and 'prefers to eat healthily but not a fussy eater and open to try local foods. 

The document also makes note of her love of running, saying under 'Personal Time' that she requests '1 hour (early morning) for exercise.'

Her morning jogs have become known among other foreign staff, who often join her in her precious sole hour of 'alone time' in her hectic day.

The minister is also not a coffee drinker, despite only sleeping for four hours a night, noting that 'We don't have time for that'.

She prefers 'English Breakfast tea with skim milk or peppermint tea', but isn't demanding, noting that there is 'no need to provide in hotel room.'

Ms Bishop 'Prefers sparkling water, however will drink wine or Champagne at appropriate functions,' the document states.

The Foreign Minister also likes to be prepared for small talk as well as large issues, with the document revealing that she likes to be given a 'snippet' of local information 'to start conversation with interlocuters', and gives the example of meeting New York Mayor as 'Yankees scraped into the finals this week'.

It is also important for her to have gift wrap, scissors, and tape on hand, in order to wrap presents she might need to present to hosts or other leaders.

The Foreign Affairs Minister spent three hours entertaining her 85,000 Twitter followers by replying in nothing but emojis

The requests continued to roll in, pushing the Foreign Affairs Minister to see just how far she'd take the online joke

The jokes continued on until just after 11pm when the Foreign Minister, clearly knackered from keeping up with today's youth, wrote the following Tweet
