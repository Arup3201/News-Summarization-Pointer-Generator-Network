A young Chinese woman named Song Ying who sang to her mother everyday is rejoicing after she she finally came out of a 600-day coma.

Doctors were amazed when they heard that Chinese woman Hu Xuehong, 47, had woken up after almost two years in a coma after her daughter Song Ying, 24, gave up her job as an accountant to care for her.

Asked what she had done the young woman said that apart from feeding and bathing her mother, she had also been singing a popular Chinese children song called: 'Mum is best'.

Doctors were amazed when they heard that Chinese woman Hu Xuehong, 47, had woken up after almost two years in a coma after her daughter Song Ying, 24, gave up her job as an accountant to care for her

Hu Xuehong had collapsed after a brain hemorrhage in 2012 at the town of Guankou, in the county of Sishui in central China's Hubei province.

Her daughter had graduated as an accountant at the start of that year and had immediately landed a job, but only three months later she had to give it up on hearing that her mother had been taken sick.

She said: 'I had a call from a neighbour who said she had been suffering from a pain in the chest and had been feeling very sick.

Asked what she had done the young woman said that apart from feeding and bathing her mother, she had also been singing the nursery rhyme that her mother had sunk to her so much as a child

'By the time she was at the hospital she was unconscious and diagnosed with cerebral haemorrhage. She was operated on for seven hours and I was hopeful that she would then survive, but she never woke up.' 

It was not possible for them to remain in the hospital and it was also impossible for the 51-year-old father to care for her at the family's modest home.

She said: 'As a family we decided that my father would carry on working, and I would give up my job to care for my mother as this was a full-time occupation. The medical fees have cost us 200,000 RMB (£20,000) and my sister is still working so that we can try to pay those.

'I had a lot to do looking after my mother but whenever I wasn't busy with chores I would sit by her bed and sing the song.

'It was her birthday on 21 March, and we bought a cake and lit the candles and then me and my sister and father sang her favourite song again – only this time as I was holding her hand I felt the grip tighten.

'I couldn't believe she was squeezing my hand and then seconds later she opened her eyes and smiled at me. It's the first time she has seen the light of day in 600 days.'

Doctors say that the chances of anyone coming round after such a long length of time is extremely unlikely and have suggested that the woman's frequent singing reached through to her mother and helped her to wake.

Song added: 'I never gave up on my mum, now we need to concentrate on getting her back on her feet.'
