A man has been charged after a 12-year-old girl was stabbed twice in the back close to her home.

Lawrence Wood, 31, from Marsh Green, Wigan, Lancashire, will face magistrates tomorrow accused of attempted murder.

The unnamed youngster was attacked in broad daylight at about 4.15pm on Wednesday afternoon in a street close to her home in the northern town.

Attack: Stranraer Road, Lancashire, where a 12-year-old girl was stabbed yesterday

She was taken to hospital where she underwent emergency surgery after suffering punctured lung.

Her injuries are not believed to be life threatening and her condition is described as stable.

Wood was originally arrested on 
suspicion of wounding with intent, but charged with attempted murder 
after questioning by police.

Detective Chief Inspector Howard 
Millington, of Wigan CID, had earlier said: 'This incident is 
understandably going to cause concern in the local community.

'However, I would like to try and reassure people that this was an isolated incident and a man was arrested shortly afterwards.

'He remains in custody where we are continuing to question him.

'There are extra officers patrolling 
in the area to provide reassurance to residents and if anyone has any 
concerns or has information they wish to pass to police about this 
incident, they can either speak directly to these officers or call us.'
