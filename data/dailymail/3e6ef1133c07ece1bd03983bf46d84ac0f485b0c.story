Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar believes his former club have already identified Mexican stopper Guillermo Ochoa as a possible replacement for Simon Mignolet.

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers said the Belgium international would be sidelined for an 'indefinite' period after dropping him for the match at Manchester United a fortnight ago.

However, the 26-year-old earned an unexpected reprieve when Brad Jones was forced off with a thigh injury 15 minutes into the 1-0 Boxing Day win against Burnley.

Simon Mignolet's place in Liverpool's starting line-up is far from safe, claims Bruce Grobbelaar 

Despite playing his part in a 4-1 win against Swansea on Monday night, Liverpool legend Grobbelaar believes the Belgian may be on borrowed time with 2014 World Cup star Ochoa in the frame.

He told talkSPORT: 'I’m not really any more encouraged by Mignolet [following his dropping]'.

'He's learned his lesson. He needs to play better. I'm a stickler on goalkeepers that don't start in the right position and his starting positions have been all wrong.

'Liverpool need another goalkeeper and I believe Ochoa from Mexico has been looked at.'
