A woman who may be a 'possible DUI driver' led the California Highway Patrol on a slow-speed chase, and even stopped at traffic lights, through Los Angeles for almost an hour, officers said.

The CHP became aware of the woman after someone called 911 to report there was an erratic driver in a black SUV on a freeway in Orange County around 12:30pm Wednesday. 

The woman was 'weaving, accelerating and slowing down,' according to a tweet by the official CHP Southern Division Twitter.

A woman who may be a 'possible DUI driver' led the California Highway Patrol on a slow-speed chase, that included stopping at traffic lights (pictured in the black car), for almost an hour, officers said

The chase finally came to an end in Pasadena  when one patrol officer tapped the rear bumper of the woman's SUV and sent the car into a slow spin. The woman then exited her vehicle and raised her hands up

Unlike typical police chases, the woman wasn't speeding and was driving at 35 and 40mph, CHP officer Juan Galvan told KTLA. 

The woman stopped for red lights, but Galvan said she was weaving in and out of traffic lanes and failed to yield when authorities tried to stop her. 

Patrol officers left their vehicles twice after she halted at two stoplights, but continued their pursuit when she kept on driving, according to NBC Southern California.  

The chase finally came to an end around 1:15pm when one patrol officer tapped the rear bumper of the woman's SUV - known as a pursuit intervention technique. 

This sent the car into a slow spin. The woman then exited her vehicle and raised her hands up. 

She was taken into custody without incident. 

The woman was 'possibly a DUI driver' and authorities are currently determining whether alcohol or drugs were a factor in her behavior, according to CHP Officer Edgar Figueroa.
