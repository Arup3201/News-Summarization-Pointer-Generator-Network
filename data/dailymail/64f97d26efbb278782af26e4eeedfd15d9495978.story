They say birds of a feather flock together, and these beautiful starlings make the perfect pair - even though there are thousands of them.

An extraordinary image captured above Didcot Power Station shows a gigantic cloud of birds forming the shape of a two in the sky.

The remarkable spectacle appeared over the Oxfordshire landmarkÂ  at the end of a cloudless day.

Double trouble: The birds create a perfect figure above Didcot Power Station in Oxon after appearing apparently from nowhere

Photographer George Reszeter captured the moment after waiting patiently beside the power station in the hope of witnessing the event, having heard of its beauty a year earlier.

The 59-year-old, from Abingdon, described the sight as 'sheer bliss', with the birds appearing to come out of nowhere.

He said: 'I arrived at about 3.30pm and waited, wondering if I was in the correct location.

'I had heard about this roost last year and, for various reasons, never managed to get there, but that afternoon I decided to make the effort.

'At about 4.10pm, the first trickle of birds started to arrive and, within minutes, the sky was swirling with starlings - there were thousands of them.

'It was as if a zip in the sky had been opened.

'The strange thing was though, despite there being thousands of birds in the sky it was very quiet, almost eerie.

'It was sheer bliss but it seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.

'How they managed to avoid the power line cables to create a perfect two was awesome but all too soon the starlings had gone.'
