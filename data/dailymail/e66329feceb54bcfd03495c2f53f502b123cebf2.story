Jodi Arias is raising money for victims for domestic violence by selling 'Survivor' T-shirts via her website, as jurors debate whether she will face the death penalty for killing her ex-boyfriend.

The murder suspect is advertising shirts for $15 on jodiaarias.com, along with her paintings of Californian sunsets, animals and castles in the clouds.Â 

Proceeds from the T-shirts will go to a Long Beach women's shelter along with charity Reach Beyond Domestic Violence. The money is also being used to fund Arias' family while they are staying in Phoenix, Arizona during her lengthy trial.

The shirts come in black and white and have the word 'Survivor' written on the front in flowery script.

Arias is reportedly making thousands of dollars by selling art that she continues to make from behind bars. eBay has banned her from their site so she is relying on a loyal group of friends running her website where pieces of Arias' artwork are on offer for $3,000.

Her mother confirmed last month that the colored pencil drawings made by Arias were being sold through a third party.

When asked if the drawings - portraits of unidentified women or dead celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly- were selling, Sandra Arias said: 'Oh yea.'

Arias is charged with first-degree murder in the May 2008 death of on-off lover Travis Alexander, who was stabbed multiple times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head at his Mesa, Arizona home.

The prosecution claims she planned the attack in a jealous rage but Arias' defense team says it was self-defense.

The defense team for Arias has alleged that Alexander had grown physically abusive in the months before she killed him, once even choking her into unconsciousness, but she kept seeing him because she was in love.

However, there has been no evidence or testimony during the trial to corroborate her stories that Alexander was violent or owned a gun - the weapon she says she used to shoot him.

The defense has portrayed Alexander as a cheating womanizer who used Arias for sex and abused her physically and emotionally.

Prosecutors have depicted Arias as an obsessed ex-girlfriend who couldn't come to grips with the ending relationship.

Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, was shot in the forehead, and had his throat slit. Arias' palm print was found in blood at the scene, along with nude photos of her and the victim from the day of the killing.

She said she recalls Alexander attacking her in a fury after a day of sex. She said she ran into his closet to retrieve a gun he kept on a shelf and fired in self-defense but has no memory of stabbing him.

She could receive the death penalty if she is found guilty.
