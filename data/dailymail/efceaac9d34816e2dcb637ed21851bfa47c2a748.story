Urbanised areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size, according to a new study.

Researchers studied the 'births' of thunderstorms - known as storm initiations - between 1997 and 2013 and found a significant increase in densely populated areas such as Atlanta.

And this has been tied to the increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas in the same geographical location.

By studying the 'births' of thunderstorms (stock image) - officially known as storm initiations - experts have found they occur more frequently in urbanised areas. This is tied to  increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas of the same size in the same goegraphical location

Researchers from Northern Illinois University studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast US between 1997 and 2013. 

They found that urbanised areas such as Atlanta are 5 per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms, on a given day, than rural areas of the same size.

'Per year, that amounts to two or three more thunderstorms of the pop-up variety,' explained lead researcher Alex Haberlie. 

'These originate over the city or downwind and are separate from large and more easily predicted weather events.' 

Storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months, in July and August, in the late afternoon and early evening. 

And the study found more 'births' occurred during the week than at weekends. 

These findings add further weight to the fact rising temperatures increase the frequency of storms, but also that increased pollution levels in urban areas play a major role.

During the week, more businesses and factories produce emissions than at weekends, for example. 

Rural areas showed no significant differences between weekdays and weekends.

In addition to pollution, the study said urbanised areas cause more storms because they create 'urban heat-islands'.

Concentrations of buildings can increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities, compared to high pressures in rural areas. 

This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms.

Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air.

'City planners, meteorologists and citizens who live in or near large urban areas should be aware of the increased risk,' Mr Haberlie continued.

'These storms can produce dangerous weather hazards, including lightning, hail, strong winds and flash floods, often with little or no warning.' 

As air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the Equator, the air mass near the surface 'absorbs' water through evaporation.

The warmer the air mass, the more water it takes up, and as it reaches the Equator, it begins to rise through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space.

Cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, and heat is released.

When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm.

As a result, many experts predict that global warming will cause the number of thunderstorms to increase and they are often used as indicators of rising temperatures and climate change.

Thunderstorms get  energy from the heat released by the condensation of water vapour (illustrated). Using climate records, and simulations up to 2098, experts recently said warming will create more precipitation and less circulation. The number of storms will stay the same, but they will become more intense 

However, earlier this month a separate study found that instead of increasing in number, storms will increase in intensity as the globe gets warmer - meaning the same number of storms will occur, but they'll be stronger.

Researchers from the University of Toronto explained that the Earth's atmosphere needs fuel to work, which in this instance is energy from the sun.

When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm.

The 'output' of this atmospheric engine, and storms, is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the Equator and the North and South Poles. 

The  physicists said that this is because global warming will directly affect how the atmosphere circulates air mass, heat and water using what's been dubbed 'Earth's heat engine.' 

Frederic Laliberté and his colleagues from the University of Toronto compared climate records from 1981 to 2012 with climate simulations. 

This comparison revealed that a third of the atmospheric energy is typically involved with the movement of water through the cycle.

But, as a result of climate change, the atmosphere is expected to use more energy during this part of the cycle. 

This is because the air will be warmer, so will take up more water, which will create more evaporation and precipitation.

By using more energy to move the water, less energy is used to circulate the air mass, and an increase in water vapour, put simply, will make the process less efficient.

The atmosphere still needs to get rid of the precipitation it collects, but because circulation is affected, it has to do this in fewer, more intense storms.

Air masses that are able to reach the top of the atmosphere are strengthened, while those that can't, are weakened.
