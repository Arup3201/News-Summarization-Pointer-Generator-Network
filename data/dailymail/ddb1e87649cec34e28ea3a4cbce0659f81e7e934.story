The living nightmare a family from Victoria has been through for the past two years looks to be finally over after the suspected remains of murder victim Patricia Ann Gay were found.

Her remains were discovered near a creek bed on a Victorian farm just 3km from her home, The Herald Sun reported. Ms Gay’s daughter Brooke James tearfully told how the ordeal had torn their family apart.

'It’s a nightmare to wake up every morning and wonder what’s happened to her, where is she,' Ms James told The Herald Sun.

'It’s horrible to see her face every time you close your eyes, trying to go to sleep.

'You wonder what’s happened and did she suffer. What was running through her head when it was happening.'

Not knowing what happened to their 'funny, caring and beautiful natured' mother was devastating for Ms James – Ms Gay disappeared from the area on March 2012.

Although this brought her family some closure and they were now able to lay their mother to rest, still not knowing what happened to her was difficult for them to comprehend.

'It’s still on your mind 24/7. What happened? Why did it happen? Who done it?' she said.

Despite extensive searches of the area when the mother-of-five disappeared two years ago no trace was found of her. 

It was only after skeletal remains that were believed to be Ms Gay’s had been found by a farmer recently as he cleared land on his property on the outskirts of Malmsbury that the family's nightmare looked to be over.

Once the bones were identified as human, and most likely belonging to  her, Ms Gay's family were notified.

The property owner found the bones when he was recently clearing his land. They were scattered over a 20sqm area in shrubbery adjacent to the creek.

Police do not believe her body was recently dumped in the area.

Ms Gay was wearing pyjamas when she was last seen by her daughter at about 10.30pm on Sunday March 11, 2012, at her Malmsbury property. She was reported missing the next morning.

Homicide squad detective Senior Sergeant Shane O’Connell said the evidence suggests foul play took place and he ruled out suicide or the fact Ms Gay, who was ill and required medication, may have wandered off from her Malmsbury home and fallen in the creek.

'There were a number of things in the initial stages that didn’t ring true (that led us to believe her disappearance was suspicious),' he told The Herald Sun.

'I can’t go into detail about that because it is an ongoing investigation and our concerns have very much heightened since the location of these remains.

Patricia (left) was last seen by her daughter at about 10.30pm on Sunday March 11, 2012, at her Malmsbury property 

'But given the area we are searching is not in close proximity to (her) house and the terrain between the two is quite rough, and her ill health, suggests the likelihood of her getting to this location on her own is highly unlikely.'

Further forensic testing will be conducted on the remains to make a formal identification and to try to determine the cause of death. So far police have no suspects or a motive.
