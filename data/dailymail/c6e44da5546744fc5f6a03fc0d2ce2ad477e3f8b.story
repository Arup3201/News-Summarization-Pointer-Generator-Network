Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba will absent for Besiktas' Europa League clash against Tottenham.

The 29-year-old swapped west London for Istanbul in the summer and on matchday two converted the penalty which secured the Turkish giants a late 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane.

Ba will, though, miss the return fixture at the Ataturk Olimpiyat Stadium on Thursday due to a broken toe, while fellow attacker Mustafa Pektemek is also absent for Slaven Bilic's men.

The frontman slotted home a penalty during the first game at White Hart Lane earlier in the season 

Both sides' progression to the knockout stages has already been secured ahead of this match, but Besiktas know victory would see them usurp Spurs at the top of Group C.

'We've got a good form, we have got good results,' former West Ham and Everton defender Bilic said.

'We have before us a great team and a tough test awaits.

'There are a number of our players that are missing and we have to be careful about injuries and fatigue.'
