Stepping down: Judge Sir Paul Coleridge claimed to have strong backing within the judiciary

A High Court judge, who is stepping down after being rebuked for campaigning in favour of marriage, claimed yesterday to have strong backing within the judiciary.

Sir Paul Coleridge said only ‘one or two’ of his colleagues were opposed to his traditional views.

He spoke out after being given a formal warning by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling for judicial misconduct.

An inquiry by the Office for Judicial Complaints, the body that polices the behaviour of judges, had found his speeches and newspaper articles were ‘incompatible with his judicial responsibilities’.

Last December the office advised Sir Paul to take a lower profile after he had protested about the devastating impact of family break-up on children, criticised cohabitation, and called for greater support for marriage.

Sir Paul, who handles family cases as Mr Justice  Coleridge, could have served for another five years and was effectively forced out.

He said: ‘I would like to refute the erroneous suggestion that my fellow judges are opposed to what I have been doing. With one or two exceptions they have been very, if quietly, supportive.’

Sir Paul said he was a whistleblower who needed to speak out against the collapse of family life.

He confirmed his decision to step down as a judge in April – a resignation announced earlier this year – was linked to his public attempt to speak up for marriage.

Sir Paul set up the Marriage Foundation think tank to champion the institution on a national basis and promote ‘healthy, stable relationships’.

He said he strongly disagreed with the inquiry’s conclusion that his ‘occasional comments on the huge social problem of family breakdown or my public support for the Marriage Foundation amounts to misconduct or brings the judiciary into disrepute’.

The judge added: ‘Indeed I think the contrary is true.

‘One or two members of the public may resent my intervention for their own particular reasons, hence their complaints, but, judging by the support I have received, that is not the view of the majority.’

He said his work with the think tank might be ‘unusual and unconventional for a judge’ but it had not interfered with his work in the courtroom.

‘Tackling these urgent problems calls for those of us who know more about them than anyone else occasionally to blow the whistle publicly and do something,’ Sir Paul said.

He said he would quit the High Court at Easter, adding: ‘I could have carried on for a further five years – and been prepared to complete them – but it is not really feasible if I have to look over my shoulder every time I want publicly to support the Marriage Foundation or its work. My position would become increasingly untenable.’

Last week Sir Paul wrote an article in the Daily Mail in which he said people who wanted to be parents should get married and added that supporting marriage was ‘something our courts no longer seem able or willing to do’.

He said: ‘The fact is that the single most vital factor, by far, in the successful development of children is a committed, healthy relationship between their parents.’
