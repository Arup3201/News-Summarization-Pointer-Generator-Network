Ukraine's prime minister Mykola Azarov resigned along with his entire cabinet today over the country's deepening political crisis, as parliament repealed harsh anti-protester laws.

Azarov said he was stepping down in a bid to ease 'a political compromise to peacefully resolve the conflict' and preserve Ukraine's unity, adding that he had been forced to work in 'extreme conditions'.

In a statement on the presidential website prime minister Viktor Yanukovych said: 'I accept the resignation of Mykola Azarov and as a consequence the resignation of the entire Ukrainian government.' He added that Azarov will remain in a temporary role until a new government can be elected.

Ukraine's prim minister Mykola Azarov submitted his resignation this morning amid continuing political protests in the capital Kiev

At a special session of parliament today the Ukrainian government has scrapped anti-protest laws which sparked violence across the country

President Viktor Yanukovych has also offered an amnesty to imprisoned demonstrators if activists cease their occupation of central Kiev

While the joint moves are a major concession to anti-government protesters across the country, they do not address the two key demands that Yanukovych himself stands down and that fresh elections are held.

Yanukovych has also suggested he will offer an amnesty for arrested 
protesters on the condition that demonstrators stopped occupying 
buildings and ended their round-the-clock protests on Kiev's central 
Independence Square.

Azarov was a fierce political leader loyal to the president, who once told his critics to 'piss off'. The Russian national has been the target of opposition ridicule in the past for his inability to speak Ukrainian.

He has blasted an EU partnership deal that was scrapped by Yanukovych and has hailed Russia's controversial bailout of Ukraine as 'historic'.

Azarov has also taken to Facebook to thank supporters and take on critics, accusing the opposition of trying to stage a 'coup' and reiterating his message of stability - particularly for pensioners.

He headed the election campaign in 2010 that helped Yanukovych defeat his sworn rival - now jailed opposition leader - Yulia Tymoshenko.

Azarov's departure will be welcomed by the activists, as he was a particular target of anti-government hatred

Yesterday a man was found dead hanging from Independence Square protest 'tree' in Kiev. The 'new year tree' has become a symbol of pro-EU and anti-government protests

Standing guard: Demonstrators stand guard at the entrance to the Justice Ministry, which became the fourth government building to be occupied during the protests, but was quickly abandoned after the justice minister threatened to declare a state of emergency

Violent: Hundreds of protestors burst into the building on Sunday night. They erected a number of barricades, before burning a portrait of President Viktor Yanukovych

Defence: The ministry is situated several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in central Kiev. Above, a protester erects a barricade near the building

Action: Speaking to a local TV crew, Ms Lukash said the 'so-called protesters' had seized the building as ministry employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters. Above, demonstrators pull a public bin to be used in the construction of barricades

Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of the protest leaders, has already turned down the now-vacant prime minister's 
job, which Yanukovych had offered him on Saturday.

A 
key issue moving forwards will be the amnesty offer, which could allow for the release 
of dozens of protesters currently being held in jail in exchange for an 
end to the demonstrations.

Azarov's departure has brought encouragement to people at the protest encampment, but no inclination to end their demonstrations.

'The authorities are afraid and making concessions. We should use this moment and continue our fight to achieve a change of power in Ukraine,' said 23-year-old demonstrator Oleg Rudakov.

In another sinister development yesterday a
 55-year-old man was found dead hanging from the framework of a
 huge artificial 'New Year tree' in central Kiev which has become a
 symbol of anti-government resistance.

Police
 said they removed the body, which was hanging inside the cone-shaped 
tubular steel construction on Kiev's Independence Square. The 'tree' is 
festooned with a poster of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and
 scrawled with graffiti attacking president Viktor Yanukovich.

The
 body, that of a man from Volyn region in western Ukraine, had no 
external wounds and was being examined to establish the cause of death, a police statement said.

The
 incident was especially bizarre since the square has been swarming with
 protesters day and night since the onset of mass demonstrations against 
in early December.

Last night protesters briefly occupied the ministry building of Elena Lukash, Ukraine's justice minister, but abandoned it again after she threatened to call off talks and declare a state of emergency.

Seized: Staff had also been attempting to make changes in the constitution, she said. Above, three anti-government protesters stand guard at the ministry with icons

Speech: Opposition leader and former WBC heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko (pictured) addresses the media in front of the ministry in Kiev today

Demonstrations: Beleaguered President Viktor Yanukovych offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday, which he declined

Chaos: President Yanukovych also offered former boxer Vitali Klitschko, another opposition leader, the role of Deputy Prime Minister. Above, protestors face riot police

Upcoming 'judgement day': Mr Yatsenyuk said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for Tuesday would be 'judgement day'

Though the occupation was short lived, it underlines protesters' growing 
inclination to take radical action after two months of largely peaceful 
demonstrations turned violent.

Three 
protesters died in the clashes last week, two of whom were shot by 
hunting rifles, which police insist they do not use. With protesters now
 willing to risk injury, a state of emergency would be likely to set off
 substantial fighting on the streets of the capital.

'Today, such a measure is not on the table,' Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara told journalists.

EU
 foreign police chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement that she was 
alarmed by reports about the government considering a state of emergency
 and warned that such a move 'would trigger a further downward spiral 
for Ukraine which would benefit no one.'

Ashton,
 who is set to travel to Ukraine Tuesday, called for a dialogue and 
urged the opposition leaders to dissociate themselves from those who 
resort to violence.

Protesters still occupy three sizable buildings in downtown Kiev, 
including City Hall. One of the buildings was seized in a spectacular 
assault early Sunday, when hundreds of protesters threw rocks and 
firebombs into the building where about 200 police were sheltering. The 
crowd eventually formed a corridor through which the police left.

Lukash,
 in a televised statement, noted that protesters seized the building as 
justice employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to 
the activists and to make changes in the constitution to restore more power
 to the prime minister.

A city in flames: The president's announcement came as fresh violence erupted in Kiev, with a large crowd attacking a government exposition and conference hall

Danger: Demonstrators were throwing firebombs into the Ukrainian House building and setting off fireworks - to which police responded with tear gas

Deal: President Yanukovych has offered the role of Prime Minister to Arseniy Yatsenyuk (left) with fellow opposition leader Vitali Klitschko (right) as his deputy.

Concern: Today's prospect of a state of emergency also follows other official statements suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the protesters in the wake of the violent clashes. Three protesters have now died in the protests - two of them after being shot and one of unspecified injuries

Yanukovych
 on Saturday offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one
 of the opposition's most prominent leaders. Yatsenyuk rejected the offer, but said protests would continue and that a special 
session of parliament called for Tuesday would be 'judgment day'

The
 protests began in late November when Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited 
agreement to deepen ties with the 28-nation European Union and sought a 
bailout loan from Russia.

The demonstrations grew in size and intensity 
after police violently dispersed two gatherings. Demonstrators then set 
up a large tent camp on Kiev's main square.

After
 Yanukovych approved the new anti-protest laws, demonstrations spread 
into other parts of the country, including to some cities in the 
Russian-speaking east, the base of Yanukovych's support.

Fire: A demostrator walks near burning tyres during an anti-government protest in downtown Kiev. The protest movement is reportedly now spreading beyond the capital

Prayers: An orthodox priest stands between between police and protestors at the scene of anti-government demonstrations near Dynamo Stadium in Kiev

Protesters have occupied Kiev's city hall for nearly two months and turned it into a makeshift dormitory and headquarters. The government claims they are holding two police officers hostage

Fortifications: The protests began in late November when President Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union

Spread: Protests have now spread into other parts of the country, including to some cities in the Russian-speaking east, the base of Yanukovych's support
