Jockey Andrea Atzeni will be used ahead of Jamie Spencer on two-year-olds owned by Qatar Racing for the remainder of the season in order to familiarise himself with their string ahead of taking over as No 1 jockey next year.

David Redvers, racing manager to Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s organisation, has confirmed the arrangement, which will also involve handing two-year-old rides where possible to Oisin Murphy, Atzeni’s Qatar Racing understudy in 2015.

But Redvers emphasised that Spencer will continue to be the first choice on the team’s older horses until his retirement at the end of the season.

Spencer will ride Side Glance as he returns to Australia, where he won last year’s Mackinnon Stakes, and be the pick for a Breeders’ Cup squad which could include Just The Judge, Trade Storm and Secret Gesture.

Atzeni, arguably the jockey of the season and due to ride his St Leger winner Kingston Hill in Sunday’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe, was on board the Sheik’s new purchase Elm Park, winner of the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday.

The Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on October 25 could now be on the agenda for the Andrew Balding-trained colt.

Redvers said: ‘There is no doubt Andrea is a young jockey going forward at a fast rate. He has lots of confidence and his ride on Elm Park, who wasn’t going anywhere three furlongs out showed great maturity.

Spencer is retiring from as first jockey at Qatar Racing, allowing Atzeni to come in

‘Our intention is to give Andrea and Oisin as much experience as possible of the two-year-olds going into the winter as their commitments allow.’

Qatar Racing’s Derby fourth Arod, who hasn’t run since his fifth to Australia in the International Stakes at York in August and was forced to miss Friday’s Joel Stakes at Newmarket, is being lined up for the Group One Queen Elizabeth, his first run at a mile since his debut last year.

Redvers said: ‘It was bizarre, Arod choked eating some straw and in the process he broke a tooth. There was some serious inflammation and he had to be treated with antibiotics.

‘It was a shame as we would have like to have tried him over a mile before the QEII. After the Derby, we thought he was a mile and a half horse but he has got stronger and quicker as he has got older and they just have not been going quick enough in his races.

‘We hope dropping back to a mile will be the key to him.’

OL MAN RIVER is a 10-1 shot for the 2015 Derby with Coral after a clear-cut two-and-three-quarter-length win in the Group Two Beresford Stakes at the Curragh.

Trainer Aidan O’Brien said the impeccably-bred colt could run again this season. He holds entries in the Dewhurst Stakes and Racing Post Trophy.
