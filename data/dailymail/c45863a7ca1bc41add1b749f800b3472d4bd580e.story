Humans may be staying inside for the frigid temperatures of the polar vortex, but the gust of arctic weather has brought unexpected guests to New York City.

Seven snowy owls have been spotted this year in the city, which reached a 60-year low of 1F for February 20 on Friday morning.

The birds are generally seen along the water in Brooklyn and Queens, but one was found on Governor's Island off the southern tip of Manhattan, according to DNA Info.

A snowy owl was cited on Governor's Island and the park's staff asked for New Yorkers to help name the bird

A spokesman for the island said that it is the first time that snowy owls have been seen at the site, which is accepting proposals for what to name the animal.

The arrival of the white-feathered owls, which are native to Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia, comes as air from Russia moved over the North Pole and has pushed south into the US.

Temperatures in Embarrass, Minnesota, slid down to -41F on Thursday.

The cold front, dubbed the Siberian Express, has brought single-digit temperatures as far south as Georgia as well as bringing arctic birds to the US.

Snowy owls are carnivorous and experts advise against approaching the predators, who mostly eat lemmings, rodents and fish, according to National Geographic.

Unlike many other owls, they are active both during the day and at night.

This year's snowy owl sightings follow on dozens of the birds appearing in New York during last year's polar vortex.

A group of owls is called a parliament.
