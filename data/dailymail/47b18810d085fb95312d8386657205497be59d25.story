Called a 'monster' and 'evil,' by those in court, Carnell Petetan Jr. was sentenced to death Thursday in the murder of estranged wife, Kimberly Farr Petetan

It took jurors in Waco's 19th State District Court roughly 225 minutes before returning to the courtroom with a punishment-phase verdict.

While they found Petetan was a continuing threat to society, they did not find him exempt from execution on the grounds of mental impairment.

Carnell Petetan, Jr. was convicted of shooting estranged wife Kimberly Farr Petetan to death

As Judge Ralph Strother handed down the death sentence on the 38-year-old Petetan, deputies circled him in the courtroom.

When Petetan was asked if there was any reason the sentence should not be imposed, he said it was because he was not guilty, the Waco Tribune reported.

During victim impact statements, Kimberly's youngest daughter said Petetan had robbed his family of its most important person'

“I don’t think you are dumb,' the 11-year-old girl said. “I just think you are evil.'

Oldest son Tyler Farr called him a 'monster.'

'You got what you deserved,' he said. 'The next time I see you will be the last time you’ll see anybody.'

He called his mother a good woman who even saw the good in her murderer.

The couple met when Kimberly started writing him in prison in 2009 after she had a chance meeting with his brother.

Defense attorneys called four expert witnesses in an attempt to prove Carnell Petetan was mentally disabled

Kimberly was a recovering drug addict studying to become a drug abuse counselor, and Carnell's brother believed her story could help his brother.

At the time, Carnell was serving 20 years for shooting two men and attacking another with a chair in separate incidents when he was 16.

At the time Carnell was serving a 20-year-prison term for three violent assault charges.

Through out the trial, Carnell denied having broke into Kimberly's Lake Shore Drive apartment to murder her in September 2012.

However two men who rode with him from Port Arthur earlier that day said they witnessed the homicide, as did her daughter.

Carnell claimed one of the unidentified men fired the fatal shots himself.

Defense attorney Russ Hunt Sr. said the verdict was unsurprising.

'We believe that Carnell is mentally retarded and
 we thought the jury may have thought so, too, but not enough to prevent
 him from receiving the death penalty,' he said.

While an appeal is possible, Hunt said he wants an attorney with a 'fresh set of eyes' to review the case.

Carnell Petetan was called 'the most dangerous man' prosecutors had seen in 25 years as they urged jurors to hand down a death sentence

Carnell had just been released from prison a few months prior when he murdered his wife.

Even before his assault sentencing, Carnell had been behind bars since the age of 13 when he attacked a teacher. and spent most of his teenage years in a state juvenile facility before graduating to prison.

Far from a model prisoner, his early years were marked by the sexual assault of three other inmates as well as attacks on guards and membership in the 357 Graveyard Crips prison gang.

'You have the luxury of knowing how that animal will act inside a cage,' Reyna told them.

'He is a maniacal, evil, deceitful, aggressive killer,' he continued. 'Is he retarded? No. He is just evil.'

Renya called him a jungle predator as he urged a death sentence.

'There is absolutely no remorse in the evil heart
 that beats in that beast,' he said. 'You are not taking a life. He 
forfeited his life through his actions. He earned every bit of that 
death penalty.'

Defense attorneys argued that regardless of the jury's decision, Carnell would die in prison. 

Arguing for life in prison, attorney Michelle Tuegel noted that the expert testimony of four witnesses showed that Carnell was retarded and low-functioning, a claim the state had not bothered to refute with a single expert of their own.

'Carnell did not choose to be born with a 
disability. He didn’t choose to have a mother who is an enabler and a 
father who is an abuser,' she said.

Prosecutors noted Petetan's history of violence, including assaults as a juvenile and later being given a 20 year sentence for attacking multiple men

'Do justice. Love mercy. Go humbly before God,' she said, quoting Micah 6:8. 'Today you have a chance to do something 
extraordinary. Will you show mercy? Will you show compassion in the face
 of total brokenness?'

Davis argued that Carnell Petetan was the most dangerous person he'd seen in 25 years of prosecuting capital murder.

Though Davis refrained from advocating for death, he said he knew the advocates for justice would lead the jury to a proper decision.

'We have the death penalty in this state because we do place a high value on human life,' he said.

After the verdict was read, Reyna commended the prosecution team.

'Today, Carnell Petetan Jr. received the justice 
that was coming to him,' he told reporters 'It was the choices he made 
throughout his life and the evil that exists within him that earned him 
this death sentence.
