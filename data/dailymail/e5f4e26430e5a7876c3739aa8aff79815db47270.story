Frank Lampard will be able to extend his stay at Manchester City further into 2015 if his parent club New York City FC decide to hold a pre-season training camp in England.

Lampard has quickly become an integral part of Manuel Pellegrini’s thinking at the Etihad Stadium, having impressed with goals and match-winning performances since joining on loan from City's sister club in August.

With the American MLS season due to start in March and the 36-year-old initially expected to head to New York for pre-season sometime in the New Year, suggestions that City may try to keep hold of him a little longer have caused some consternation across the Atlantic.

However, it is understood one possibility that could help satisfy both clubs is  New York City using the English club’s new Etihad Campus training facility as a base for their own pre-season training camp in January or February.

Recently opened, the theory is that City’s new £200m facility could host NYCFC for training and accommodation while the MLS team play two or three friendly games against local lower league opposition in the North West.

This would enable Lampard to meet and spend time with his new team-mates while continuing to play for City as the NYCFC players went through stages of pre-season fitness work that he wouldn’t need.

City are aware the issue of Lampard’s availability is a sensitive one in America, where NYCFC have used the former England player’s impending arrival in marketing drives and to boost season ticket sales.

However, Lampard has already proved valuable to Pellegrini, scoring four times before injuring his thigh against Tottenham last weekend.

The former Chelsea star has said he will leave the decision about his future to the two clubs.

Meanwhile, Lampard has an outside chance of recovering from injury ahead of City’s visit to another of his old clubs, West Ham, on Saturday.

Lampard missed the Champions League trip to CSKA Moscow after being carried off on a stretcher against Tottenham last Saturday, but his thigh injury is not a serious one.

It is understood he remains a doubt for the trip to Upton Park but if he does miss the match he should be back for next week.

Lampard was voted City’s player of the month for September by fans and has already scored four goals for the club.
