A sprawling mega-mansion owned by a disgraced gold dealer is now half price as he desperately tries to find a buyer.

The lavish home, which takes influence from the Palace of Versailles outside Paris, is being offered for $12.9million - a substantial cut from when the property was first placed on the market four years ago at $25million.

Mark Yaffe reportedly agreed to offload his custom-built mansion in the exclusive enclave of Avila in Tampa, Florida to pay off multimillion dollar debts. He is head of troubled coin wholesaler National Gold Exchange.

Wealth: The grandiose reception room at the custom-built Tampa mansion is crammed with antiques

The mansion covers 29,000-square-feet and took four years to build to detailed specifications with marble archways, balconies and 14 fireplaces.

It has ten bedrooms and ten bathrooms along with 14 fireplaces, a grand ballroom, wood-paneled library, wine cellar and basketball court.

It was completed in 2004 but placed on the market only four years later.

The home has dropped in price three times since. However real estate agent Michelle Fitz-Randolph told tampabay.com: 'When something isn't selling, it's always price, price, price. They are very motivated to sell.'

She said that there had been three potential buyers for the property including two from abroad.

He has been married to wife Christel since 1988 and the couple have two children Sarah and Stephen.
