England will consider fast-tracking Sam Burgess into their Six Nations squad amid an increasingly desperate quest to find solutions to their midfield dilemma.

In the aftermath of his side’s victory over Australia at Twickenham on Saturday, head coach Stuart Lancaster admitted that Burgess is very much on the radar.

The cross-code convert made his debut for Bath on Friday night, as a replacement, but just 17 minutes into his union career, the 25-year-old Sportsmail columnist is already being talked about as an England contender.

Reflecting on that cameo off the bench at The Rec, which featured a strong burst in the centre, Lancaster said: ‘It was a good carry, wasn’t it? He is one who will be of interest, without a doubt. It took about three men to stop him. He is a powerful man and it will be nice to see him get a few more games and put his hand up.’

Asked if there is any possibility that the superstar from league could force his way into the squad for the Six Nations, Lancaster added: ‘That would be a big step, but who knows? We will wait and see. If he plays well, there’s a Saxons game in January...’

An outing for the country’s second-string side may be all it takes to convince England’s management to add Burgess to their championship plans.

Lancaster suggested that George Ford is on course to retain the No 10 shirt for the next match - against Wales in Cardiff on Friday February 6. But he urged his leading men to help create selection stability by maintaining high standards.

‘In an ideal world, the top players play consistently well week in, week out for club and country,’ he said. ‘That would make my life a lot easier.’

Meanwhile, lock Dave Attwood says he is happy for England to be branded boring just as long as they win.

‘People can say we’re the most boring team in the world if they want, but at the end of the day, winning is winning,’ said Attwood.

‘We’re in the business of producing results.'
