With stunning views, finely-dressed doormen and enviable locations, they are desirable homes.

But these ten skyscrapers, situated in the heart of Manhattan, New York, are remarkably empty.

That is because up to a huge 74 per cent of their wealthy - often, foreign - residents live elsewhere.

Instead, they rent out apartments in the buildings either as pieds-à-terre or investment properties.  

Highest proportion: At Executive Plaza (pictured), a skyscraper situated in Manhattan, New York, 74.4 per cent of the apartments are nonprimary residences, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office

Second and third: Meanwhile, 60.5 per cent of the residential floors at CitySpire (left) in West 56th Street, and 54.2 per cent of those at Three Worldwide Plaza  (right) are made up of investment flats and second homes

For example, although the marble lobby at CitySpire - a 72-story tower in West 56th Street - may appear to have an endless stream of people, this does not reflect the building's true occupancy.

Instead, more than 60 per cent of its residential floors are made up of investment properties and second homes, according to new figures from the New York City Independent Budget Office. 

Speaking to the New York Times, a tenant at the 814ft skyscraper - situated near the prestigious Carnegie Hall -  said the majority of the people there are delivery workers or visiting businessmen.

'If you pay attention to the lobby on a Friday or a Monday, you’ll see a lot of key exchanges taking place and people with suitcases coming and going,' said the resident, Nicholas Richards.

Fourth and fifth: Other largely unoccupied skyscrapers include The Vanderbilt (left, 52.6 per cent) in East 40th Street, Murray Hill, and Zeckendorf Towers (right, 51 per cent), situated on the eastern side of Union Square

Unoccupied: The lobby of Zeckendorf Towers - also dubbed One Irving Place and One Union Square East

Sixth: At The Parc Vendôme (pictured), 49.7 per cent of apartments are pieds-à-terre or investment properties. The condominium complex is situated on 340 West 57th Street, close to both Central Park and 5th Avenue

CitySpire, originally built in 1987 by Ian Bruce Eichner, boasts a fitness center with a 50-foot pool and a garage. In 2012, it unveiled a luxury penthouse costing a whopping $100million.

Meanwhile, at Executive Plaza, a skyscraper situated in West 51st Street, an enormous 74.4 per cent of the apartments - the highest proportion in the figures - are nonprimary residences.

The building, which is a short walk away from 5th Avenue shops and Central Park, allows people to rent out apartments by the month. 

The below list reveals the top ten 'emptiest' skyscrapers in New York City, alongside the proportion of their apartments that are rented out as pieds-à-terre or investment properties:

1. Executive Plaza (74.4%)

2. CitySpire (60.5%)

3. Three Worldwide Plaza (54.2%)

4. The Vanderbilt (52.6%)

5. Zeckendorf Towers (51%)

6. The Parc Vendôme (49.7%)

7. Madison Green (47.2%)

8. Continental Towers (47%)

9. The Corinthian (40%)

10. Kips Bay Towers (37.1%)

For a one-bedroom apartment rental, the price typically ranges from around $3,500 to $5500.

In addition to CitySpire's (60.5 per cent) and Executive Plaza's high proportion of nonprimary residences, other largely unoccupied buildings include Three Worldwide Plaza in West 49th Street (54.2 per cent) and The Vanderbilt in East 40th Street (52.6 per cent) in Murray Hill.

Meanwhile, 51 per cent of residents at Zeckendorf Towers - a 29-story tower near Union Square - and 49.7 per cent of those at The Parc Vendôme - based in West 51th Street - live elsewhere, the figures reveal. 

At Madison Green - a 31-story condominium building  on the corner of East 23rd Street and Broadway - 47.2 per cent of apartments are pieds-à-terre or investment properties.

A slightly fewer 47 per cent of residences at Continental Towers in East 79th Street, and 40 per cent of apartments at The Corinthian on Madison Avenue, are nonprimary.

And at Kips Bay Towers in the Kips Bay neighborhood, 37.1 per cent of tenants do not use the building as their primary home, the data shows. 

The figures are a reflection of the massive proportion (25 per cent) of co-op and condo apartments in New York City that are not used as primary residences - many, by millionaire foreigners. 

'Twenty-four percent of co-op and condo apartments citywide are not the primary residence of their owners,' George V. Sweeting, the deputy director of the budget office, told the newspaper.

'Not all of these units are pieds-à-terre; many are likely owned by investors or original sponsors.'

Seventh and eighth: At Madison Green (left) - a 31-story, 424-unit condominium building situated on the corner of East 23rd Street and Broadway - 47.2 per cent of apartments are not primary residences. Meanwhile, a slightly fewer 47 per cent of residences at Continental Towers (right) in East 79th Street are nonprimary

In recent years, the issue has proved controversial, with many complaining that residents who buy expensive apartments to use for just a few weeks a year do not have to pay personal income taxes.

The figures were acquired by the budget office using data based on the New York City co-op and condominium tax abatement. In recent years, this has been restricted to only primary residences.

Therefore, the office compared the number of apartments receiving the abatement in 2012 to the number received it this year. However, this means that the data does not include apartment buildings with 421a tax exemptions - excluding a number of recently-built condos in Manhattan. 

'There are a lot of misses, but of the condos and co-ops that are captured, the number of nonprimary residents is high,' said Andrew Beveridge, the president of a firm tracking census data and demographic information, and the chairman of Queens College's sociology department.

Ninth and tenth: Forty per centr cent of apartments at The Corinthian (left), which opened in 1988 on Madison Avenue, and 37.1 per cent of those at Kips Bay Towers, both also in Manhattan, are nonprimary residences

He added that the figures reflect the increasing levels of income inequality in New York City. 

Earlier this year, it was revealed that there has been a rise in the number of Chinese investors snapping up apartments in New York after finding they can get more for their money in Manhattan than Shanghai or Hong Kong.

Russians used to dominate the property market in the city, but their interest has dropped since the crisis in Ukraine and the increasing threat of sanctions.

The number of buyers from China is nearly a fifth higher than it was this time last year, with many signing deals on properties they haven't even viewed in person.

'By far and away, the Chinese are the fastest-growing demographic,' Dean Jones, of Sotheby's International, said in April.
