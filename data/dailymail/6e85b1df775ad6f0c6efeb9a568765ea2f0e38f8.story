Brian Matthews, pictured appearing at court, is accused of leaving his 96-year-old mother to wallow in her own filth

A son left his 96-year-old mother to wallow in her own filth without heat, light, hot water, a telephone or even a working toilet, a court heard.

Brian Matthews, 75, is accused of neglecting his mother Winifred who was found living in squalor at her Essex home.

Matthews, who held power of attorney over his mother's financial affairs, also allegedly diverted £18,000 of her pension into his own bank account leaving her in squalor.

Retired police officer Jonathan Chapman called 'the worst case he had ever seen'. 

Mr Chapman, husband of Mrs Matthews' niece Rosalind Reynolds, told the court that the stench coming from Mrs Matthews' home in Cranham, Upminster in Essex, was 'enough to knock you backwards'. 

She was left in extreme poverty between 2010 and 2013 - despite the fact she was entitled to three pensions. 

The vulnerable pensioner's toenails had been allowed to grow so long they were curling into the skin of her feet and dirt had become 'ingrained into her skin', the jury heard.

Formerly a senior member of the finance department at Barking and Dagenham Council, Mrs Matthews spent her days seated on a hard-backed dining chair by the window, next to a broken portable heater.

The court was told she did not even have basic necessities such as heat, light, hot water, a telephone or even a working toilet.

Mr Chapman said he was completely unaware of his elderly relative's plight after losing contact with her after his wife broke her back in 1997.

Mrs Reynolds later re-established contact with her aunt after a phone call from the defendant's son and alerted social services to her condition.

Two daily care visits were then arranged, the court heard.

Mr Chapman said: 'I was shocked because I been a regular visitor previously, and the house was always very clean, it was always spick and span, walking into there was heart breaking.

'I've been inside a lot of horrible houses as a police officer, yes, but this was one of the worst I'd ever seen.'

He added: 'My wife had warned me what I was going to see and about the smell of urine, but even though my wife had warned me I was still shocked.'

Ms Reynolds added: 'The dirt was ingrained into her skin. It wasn't something you could get rid of by running her hands under a tap. Her nails were long and black.

'She had a pair of slippers on, there were tears in them where her toes were poking out.

'Her nails were so long they were curled round and they were curling up the folds of her feet- they were like those witches fingers you could get in a shop.'

Mr Chapman told the court that Matthews would usually only make the 100 mile drive from his Suffolk home once a month.

He said he always knew when he had been there because he would leave a bottle of Bristol Cream sherry and a glass next to his mother. 

Mr Chapman and his wife claim they began doing repairs to the house as best they could, including hiring a plumber to fix the hot water and begin clearing the house and garden.

He said: 'We didn't initially have the funds to do all the work in one go, we didn't really know where to start so we thought we'd start with the essentials.'

Matthews was repeatedly called upon by social services to replace his mother's bedding, her fridge and her boiler, but allegedly failed to do so.

He eventually had his power of attorney over his mother revoked by the Court of Protection in April 2013.

Mrs Matthews, now 98, was moved to a care home in Romford in February 2013.

Matthews denied neglecting his mother, and even threatened to take legal action against Ms Reynolds for upsetting Mrs Matthews by 'interfering'.

In a police interview he claimed Ms Reynolds was after his mother's money and  had her placed in a care home just to spite him.

In her evidence Ms Reynolds said: 'I'm not someone who saves, so I started doing bits here and there when I got my pension each month.'

She admitted she had not inherited any money from either of her parents or from her other aunt, but denied she was after Mrs Matthews' cash.

She said: 'I inherited things that were far more important - that's how to love my family and how to treat them decently.'

Defending for Matthews, Noel Casey asked Ms Reynolds: 'You did a lot in two years, you bought things for the house, you washed all the clothes, you attempted deep cleaning the floors, by 2013 things must have improved considerably.'

She replied: 'I wouldn't say things had improved considerably, she still didn't have any heating, I was giving her food but she still wasn't being washed and bathed - things hadn't improved considerably, that was just helping out.'

Mr Casey added: 'Despite two years of your involvement, despite two carers coming every day, things still were still hardly better - that's because it's very hard to look after an elderly person in their own home.'

Matthews, of Broome, Suffolk, denies one count of fraud for allegedly taking his mother's cash for his own personal use, and one count of neglect of a person who lacks capacity, between January 2010 and July 2013.

The trial continues.
