Paul Scholes insists England manager Roy Hodgson must copy Sir Alex Ferguson when it comes to stopping Andrea Pirlo when the two sides clash at the World Cup on June 14.

Writing in his Paddy Power blog, the former Manchester United midfielder claims the Italian is the best playmaker in the world.

But he believes United showed how to deal with him when they deployed Park Ji-Sung in a man-marking role against AC Milan in the Champions League in 2010.

‘Pirlo is the world’s greatest playmaker – the complete footballer,’ writes Scholes. ‘Give him time and space and he will destroy you. He’s such a clever player and is so composed. If surrounded he’ll lay it off. If he’s got room he’s devastating.'

England have first-hand experience of Pirlo having lost to his Italy side in Euro 2012.

Scholes added: ‘Even though England’s Euro 2012 game against Italy finished 0-0, we paid nowhere near enough attention to him. Pirlo is not renowned for his athleticism, and he’s 35 now, but that day he ran 11.58km, more than any England player. He also had more passes (131) than England’s four starting midfielders.’

Scholes recalls how Ferguson learned from his mistakes when United played Milan four years ago.

‘In 2010 before Man United played AC Milan in the Champions League, Sir Alex gave very specific instructions on how to take care of Pirlo. Man-marking him was a huge part of our pre-game plan – I played against him when Milan beat us 3-0 at the San Siro in 2007. We didn’t man-mark him. He destroyed us. We learned, and it was painful,' he said.

‘Park Ji-Sung was the perfect man for Pirlo in 2010 and never gave him kick (in a 7-2 aggregate victory). You could even see Pirlo getting frustrated and having little kicks out by the end.

‘Pirlo spoke about Park in his book: "They’d programmed him to stop me. His devotion to the task was almost touching. Even though he was a famous player, he consented to being used as a guard dog.”

‘For Manaus, we need an ‘English Park Ji-Sung’ – one England player designated to man-mark him. Looking at the squad, Danny Welbeck – a good defender who can nick the ball well – could be an option and would be a bold decision, one which gives England a creative outlet, and saddles Pirlo with defensive work.’
