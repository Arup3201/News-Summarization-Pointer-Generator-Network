Pope Francis is selling one of his two Harley Davidson motobikes in order to raise money for charity.

The 1,585cc Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide was given to the Pope in June 2013 along with another bike to mark the 110th anniversary of the motorcycle brand.

The hog, which has been signed on the tank by the Pope, is to be auctioned off by Bonhams auction house in Paris, France in February and will raise money for Caritas Roma, a charity which works on behalf of the Roman Catholic church.

The bike, which has an estimated cost of £12,000, will be sold with no reserve in order to raise as much money as possible for Caritas Romas.

The charity hope to use any money to renovate a soup kitchen in Rome which offers food and shelter to more than 1,000 people.

Ben Walker, head of motorcycles at Bonhams, said: 'We are incredibly honoured to be selling this item on behalf of Caritas Roma. We hope to be able to do both Pope Francis and Harley-Davidson proud by raising a significant amount of money for a very worthy cause.'

Four days after being given the gift, His Holiness blessed a group of 100 Hells Angles in St Peters Square

Two choppers and a leather jacket were given to the pontiff in June last year in order to celebrate the 110th anniversary of Harley Davidson.

Four days after the gifts were given to him, Francis blessed a crowd of Hells Angle bikers in a congregation at an open air mass in St Peter's Square.

It is not the first time that a papal vehicle has been sold in order to raise money.

In 2005 a Volkswagen Golf which belonged to Pope Benedict was sold anonymously on eBay to German man.

It was only when he looked at the registration documents that he realised who the previous owner was, prompting him to re-sell the car for £127,000 to a Las Vegas club.

Yesterday Pope Francis was pictured blessing children in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and encouraged mothers to breast feed their children if they wanted, adding that the children were the 'most important' people there.

During the Baptism Of The Lord mass he washed the heads of 32 children, including one baby of an unmarried couple.
