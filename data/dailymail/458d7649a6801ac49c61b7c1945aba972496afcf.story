The Florida man confronted by an off-duty sheriff's deputy who caught him having sex with a woman in a community pool was shot twice in the chest, it was reported today.

Alex Alfonso, a seven-year Sheriff's Office veteran shot Anthony 'Tony' Ribero when he discovered him and the woman in the pool of his West Boca apartment complex Saturday.

Mr Ribero, 49, is now fighting for his life in hospital, his brother told a local newspaper.

Crime scene: Gunfire erupted poolside at this Boca Raton, Florida, apartment complex where an off-duty sheriff's deputy shot a man whom he caught having sex with a woman in the water

The incident took place at Reflections of Boca Del Mar, where the Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy is a resident

'He's hanging tough,' his brother Steven Ribeiro, of North Carolina, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

'Just pray for my brother, he's hanging on by a thread. If anybody can do it, he can.'

Alfonso confronted Tony Ribeiro and a woman he claims were engaged in a sex act
 just before 12.30am and told them to leave the pool area.

The
 angry man then returned to the scene in a threatening manner and was 
shot by the off duty officer who lives in the building, authorities 
said.

The deputy 
identified himself as a law enforcement official and asked the man and 
woman, who did not live in the housing complex, to leave the Reflections
 at Boca Del Mar complex's private pool, according to WPTV.

The couple reluctantly complied, but a short time later the boyfriend returned and approached the deputy in a threatening manner as he was sitting in a lounge chair by the pool, according to a report by the Palm Beach County's Sheriff's Office cited by the station.

Fiery argument: Officials say the officer told the amorous couple to leave, but the man returned and allegedly tried to attack the deputy with a glass or a bottle

The two men got into a dispute, which 
escalated when the suspect allegedly tried to hit the officer with a 
wine glass or a champagne bottle, officials said.

That is when the off-duty cop pulled out his gun and fired, striking Ribeiro.

The amorous man was taken to Delray Medical Center in critical condition.

The unidentified deputy has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.

Shocked residents were interviewed by the taped off pool on Sunday.

Phylicia Dashoff, 23, told the Sun Sentinel: 'I assumed that someone maybe drowned in the lake or the pool, because I couldn't imagine why the pool would be taped off.'
