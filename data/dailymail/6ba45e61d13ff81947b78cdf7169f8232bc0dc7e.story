This was a three-minute video about nothing.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie showed his pop culture chops and channeled the Seinfeld-Newman rivalry on a YouTube video posted on his page.

In the three minute video, Christie is thwarted, time and time again by Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who last month rescued a neighbour from a burning building.

Hello! Gov Christie, back right, posted a Seinfeld spoof where he is Newman and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, left, is Seinfeld

Newman: Christie tries to volunteer his services, but is always thwarted by Booker in the video

Heroics: The video also gives a nod to Booker's helpful nature - last month, he saved a woman from a burning building

The parody spoofs the mayor's storybook heroics and Christie's vice presidential potential.

Christie finds himself thwarted at do-gooding by Booker, who is always two steps ahead of the Republican governor.

The video, which played at Tuesday's New Jersey Press Association's Legislative Correspondents Club show, shows Christie asking a New Jersey state trooper for good deeds to do.

‘You guys got any problems you want me to handle, like a fire anywhere, people trapped?’ the New Jersey governor asks. ‘Maybe a cat in a tree?’

The trooper shakes his head and tells him there is nothing happening. Moments later, Booker turns up and assuredly tells Christie: ‘Governor, I got this!’

Clash of the titans: Newman, a disgruntled postal worker, and Seinfeld had an embattled relationship throughout the long-running NBC series

I got this: Booker popped up everywhere, and even helped Christie change a flat tire on his car - only enraging the Republican governor, who muttered 'Booker' in Seinfeld fashion

When Christie’s Cadillac gets a flat, there Booker is, telling him 'I got this' with jack in hand.

Booker later helps Bruce Springsteen replace a missing guitar (‘I always carry a spare’) and Tebows after catching a baby dropped from a state Capitol balcony before Christie's eyes.

Each time, Christie grits his teeth and laments: 'Booker!'

Booker is then shown on a phone telling Mitt Romney he wouldn't make a good running mate, saying: ‘Yes, that was me running into the fire. Yes, I do shovel snow as well.

‘Yes, you’re very persuasive, but I’m not a number two guy. I’m not a background singer.’

Christie grabs the receiver, saying: 'Excuse me mayor, I got this.'

Seinfeld and Newman had a tumultuous relationship throughout the entirely of the NBC comedy. The jaded postal worker, played by Wayne Knight, was always coming up with schemes to outdo neighbour Jerry Seinfeld.

At the ready: Booker offered Bruce Springsteen an extra guitar

Face off: While Christie couldn't keep up with Booker's good deeds, Booker conversely was no match for playing veep to Mitt Romney

The New Jersey governor has had his fair share of comedy in the past month. At the White House Correspondents’ Dinner last month, host Jimmy Kimmel singled out Christie for his waistline.

Kimmel had joked: ‘You know, they say that inside every American governor is a president struggling to get out. In Chris Christie’s case, it’s the only one where you can still hear him screaming.’

But the jokes didn’t’ stop there. Kimmel said: ‘Gov. Christie, I think you might be misunderstanding New Jersey’s slogan – it’s not the Olive Garden state.’

Not to be outdone, Christie fired back a few days after the dinner, saying: ‘(When you have Sofia Vergara) next to you do console you… you don’t care what the heck Jimmy Kimmel said.’

The Modern Family actress shared a table with him during the night’s festivities.

Jokers: Booker and Christie have always had a jovial relationship - here, they're pictured in 2011 sharing a laugh

Last laugh: At last month's White House Correspondents' Dinner, Jimmy Kimmel poked fun at Christie's weight, but the governor fired back, saying he was at least sitting next to Sofia Vergara
