Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to act to cut the cost of living, as new figures show the economic downturn left middle income households £3,000-a-year worse off

The disposable income of an average family is twice what it was in the late 1970s, official figures showed yesterday.

But the report reveals that the rise is not down to significant tax cuts, as the taxman’s share of middle-class incomes has hardly changed over the past 35 years.

The disposable income after taxes and benefits of a middle-earning and working age household is currently £29,900, according to the analysis from the Office for National Statistics.

This is a fall from a peak of £31,100 in 2007, before the recession eroded the earnings of middle Britain.

But back in 1977, the era of union barons and near national bankruptcy, the average disposable income was half this level when calculated at today’s prices – £15,500.

The proportion the Treasury takes from the average income in tax has hardly changed.

Instead the state has continued to demand virtually the same share of middle incomes – around a third.

This means that, in real cash terms, governments have taken increasing amounts from families.

The ONS report says that, at current prices, the taxman was grabbing a little over £8,000 a year from an average income family in 1977, but £14,464 out of their income in 2007, and £12,654 now.

It comes as Chancellor George Osborne faces growing calls to act to tackle the rising cost of living in Wednesday's budget.

He is expected to scrap planned rises
in fuel duty, offer more help to homebuyers and tax breaks to help 
working families with the cost of childcare.

There will also be the promise of a flat rate £155-a-week pension and a cap of £73,000 on the costs of social care which an individual will have to find before the state will help.

The statistics watchdog examined the 
effects of the downturn on the crucial ‘middle fifth’ of the income 
distribution range to see how the middle classes were hit.

Average incomes for all families rose steadily since the 1970s, until the financial crash in 2007

Before tax and cash benefits are 
taken into account, the average income for non-retired 
households in the middle fifth stood at £36,400 in 2007-08 but by 
2010-11 it had fallen by 8.8 per cent to £33,200. 

The ONS said: ‘This was largely due to
income from wages and salaries falling for this group since the start 
of the economic downturn.

‘However, the effect of falling 
earnings was partly offset by an increase in the average amount these 
households received in cash benefits and a fall in the proportion of 
gross income paid in direct taxes.’

After tax, disposable incomes also fell 
during the double dip recession but not as steeply. 

Between 2007-08 and 2010-11, after adjusting for 
inflation, the average disposable income the ‘middle fifth’ fell by 3.8 
per cent, from £31,100 a year to £29,900.

Should this Budget be George Osborne's last chance to turn around Britain's economy?

However, researchers found that over the longer-term, Britons are still much better off than in the 1970s when, allowing for inflation, the average middle income household had a disposable income of £15,500 in 1977.

For all households from the richest to the poorest, the median disposable income in 2010-11 was £22,590, wiping out rises since 2005-06.

Incomes have also been hit by the coalition's decision to increase VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent in 2010.

But at 2010-11 prices, disposable incomes are still much higher than the £10,708 enjoyed by a family in 1977.

The revelation that 'squeezed middle' families were left £3,200-a-year worse off by the recession coincides with a survey by consumer watchdog Which? suggested families have curbed their spending by more than £3,000 a year since the economic downturn.

As Brits feel the squeeze they are scaling back on buying non-essential items in an attempt to save money, according to consumer watchdog Which?.

This frugal attitude has created a £136billion hole in the economy, which is already limping under the strain of austerity measures.

The research found that even despite the 2007 financial crash, the middle classes had seen their incomes double in real terms since the 1970s, when economic turmoil and industrial strife saw rubbish piled up in the streets, including in an official rubbish dump in London's Leicester Square

In 1977, the middle fifth of non-retired households paid 16.3 per cent of their gross income in indirect taxes. By 2010/11, this had fallen to 15 per cent, the ONS said

The ONS said there was a close link between average family incomes and the state of the wider economy.

Incomes rose during periods of economic growth and fell after the recessions of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s.

For 30 years form 1977, the proportion of income paid in direct taxes remained relatively stable at around 21 to 23 per cent.

But since the downturn, the level has fallen to 19.2 per cent, largely as a result of the relative decrease in the amount of income tax paid.

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'These figures show the real cost of the UK’s living standards crisis for middle Britain, with households thousands of pounds poorer today than five years ago. 

'But rather than helping families, the government’s real-terms cut in welfare support next month will make them ever poorer.

'The Chancellor can start putting right this damage in his Budget on Wednesday by cutting VAT, which will save households hundreds of pounds a year. TUC research shows this is the most effective way to help low and middle-income households.

'Cutting VAT and reversing welfare cuts, rather than reducing corporation tax or raising the personal allowance again, would show that the Chancellor is prioritising the living standards of middle Britain over big business and rich households.'

The figures show non-retired households have seen sharper rises and bigger falls in their incomes

Increases in the personal tax allowance has contributed to a reduction in the amount the middle fifth now pay in tax, which for direct taxes (income tax, council tax) stood at 19.2 per cent of gross income in 2010/11, compared to 23.5 per cent in 1977.

Indirect taxes, such as VAT and fuel duty, have also fallen from 16.3 per cent to 15 per cent, reflecting the reduction in consumer spending during the financial crisis, but has started to rise again since the VAT rate rose to 20 per cent in January 2011.

But the figures do show the toll that the credit crunch has taken on households that were previously financially comfortable.

The average disposable income of those in the middle who have not yet retired stood at £29,900 in 2010/11, but this has fallen by around 3.8 per cent from the £31,000 it was before the financial crisis hit.

The number of non-retired households relying more on the state has also increased, with cash benefits in the middle fifth increasing by 26 per cent since the downturn began - thanks in the main to more retired people receiving the state pension.
