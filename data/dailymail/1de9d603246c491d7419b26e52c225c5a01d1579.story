Sarah Palin has taken another jibe at President Obama - this time mocking his 'coffee cup' salute.

The commander-in-chief was criticized after White House officials posted a video of him stepping off of Marine One in New York City and saluting waiting Marines while still holding a white cup.

In response Palin, speaking at the Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C, said: 'To the commander -in-chief, we then salute him,' before sarcastically waving the Styrofoam cup over her head.

However she soon became the victim of embarrassment herself when she said the White House is located at '1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.' It is actually at 1600.

'To the commander-in-chief': Sarah Palin raises a cup sarcastically above her head during a speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C. - mocking President Obama's 'coffee cup' salute earlier this week

The commander-in-chief was criticized on Wednesday after the White House uploaded a picture of him on Instagram stepping off of Marine One in New York City for a UN summit still holding the cup in his left hand 

After realizing her mistake, she tried to turn it around by poking fun at herself on Twitter.

She wrote: 'Doggone it. That explains why my Christmas cards keeps (sic) getting returned.' 

Palin then visited wrong address she had mentioned in the slip up and sent a photo underneath the street sign to CNN reporter Jake Tapper. 

Saluting military personnel is something presidents are expected to do since they're at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command.

After realizing that she had got the address of the White House wrong, Palin tried to poke fun at herself 

Obama caused a stir because it is customary for a commander-in-chief to salute uniformed servicemen and women who salute him first as a sign of respect.

Many people took to Twitter criticizing his controversial method while Donald Trump said it was 'terrible'.  

President Ronald Reagan reportedly began the tradition and future presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, followed suit. 

Marine One lands at a heliport in New York City ahead of a UN Summit - moments later the President was captured giving a salute while holding a coffee cup to waiting Marines 

Obama's casual approach to the moment as he left his Marine One chopper at a helipad in New York City came at a time when he had just ordered U.S. fighter planes to fly perilous missions in the skies over Syria.

Twitter predictably erupted, with most commenters expressing outrage. 

Before the cup gesture and subsequent gaffe at the summit, Palin was asked questions about recent photos that were taken of her without her wedding ring.

She denied her and her husband Todd were on the verge of divorce and added: 'Well, I rarely wear a ring, especially up in Alaska, you know it's choppin' wood or you're butcherin' a moose or something.'

'Terrible': Donald Trump was one of the people to have criticized the President's actions on Twitter 

The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee playfully confronted the issue on her own accord Friday afternoon, saying midway through her speech, 'I heard the other day that I'm in the middle of another divorce.' 

Palin didn't talk about the media coverage of the drunken brawl her family recently got into in Alaska during which her daughter Bristol allegedly punched a man in the face, her son Track broke four ribs and her husband Todd bloodied his nose.

Instead, she used the divorce chatter as a bridge into a lengthier rant on the mainsteam media and the perceived bias against conservatives.
