Warning: Dr Myles Bradbury has been warned he faces a substantial sentence after admitting carrying out examinations on children 'purely for his own sexual gratification' and with no medical justification

A children's doctor who admitted abusing boys in his care fondled some of his victims behind a curtain while their parents were in the room, a court has heard.

Dr Myles Bradbury has been warned he faces a substantial sentence after admitting carrying out examinations on children 'purely for his own sexual gratification' and with no medical justification.

His 18 victims, aged between 10 and 16, included children with haemophilia, leukaemia and other serious illnesses, Cambridge Crown Court heard.

In total, the married 41-year-old father-of-one, who worked at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and lived in Herringswell, Suffolk, has pleaded guilty to 25 offences including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images.

At the beginning of his sentencing hearing today, prosecutor John Farmer said the defendant had a 'longstanding, unlawful, sexual interest in boys'.

He added: 'The defendant, through the trust he had acquired, circumvented the procedures and encourages a number of young patients to see him alone.

'It was in these circumstance under the guise of legitimate examinations he went entirely beyond the bounds.

'He took the opportunity of fondling the boy's genitals and encouraging them to masturbate in his presence and obtain erections for his own personal gratification.

'On some occasions, when he failed to exclude the parent, he simply carried on behind the curtain behind which the boy had gone to remove his clothes.'

The offences took place over four-and-a-half years, beginning within six months of him taking up his post in 2008 and continuing to the day he was suspended when the first concerns were raised.

At some point, he began using a camera pen in an attempt to gain images of the boys when partially clothed, Mr Farmer added.

Police found 170,425 images on this pen but none of these were classed as indecent.

Mr Farmer explained Bradbury was first arrested in December 2013 after police were alerted by Canadian authorities that he had bought a DVD containing indecent images of children as part of Operation Spade.

At that point Cambridgeshire Police were already investigating after concerns were raised about his conduct.

Mr Farmer said the offences were a 'grave breach of trust' which had undermined the trust of patients.

'This defendant was a complete maverick and his behaviour is the antithesis of his profession - he has betrayed his profession,' he added.

The court is due to hear mitigation from Bradbury's barrister, Angela Rafferty, this afternoon before Judge Gareth Hawkesworth delivers his sentence on Monday.

Bradbury, who, the court heard, was also involved in church and Scout groups, was described as 'a man of great charm and persuasiveness' whom everybody trusted.

When one victim raised concerns with his mother, she responded: 'He's a doctor, it must be necessary.'

Brazen: Outlining details of some of Bradbury's victims, the prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating them from their parents, asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals

Mr Farmer said: 'That was the very image that really protected him from anything other than the most persistent line of complaint.'

Outlining details of some of Bradbury's victims, the prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating them from their parents, asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals.

The depth of the examinations were often increased to meet Bradbury's sexual needs, not any medical requirement, he added.

One victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said in a statement read to the court: 'I am now anxious to go to the doctor because I don't know who I should trust.

'I have haemophilia and a pain in my side so I know I should go but I feel disgusted and weird.

'I didn't think it would happen to me and I feel angry every time I think about it but also relieved it wasn't just me but we shouldn't have to go through it.'

Another said he had regular nightmares, felt stressed and lacked confidence.

'I'd like to see Myles Bradbury and ask him why he did what he did to me,' he added.

Bradbury looked anxious as he sat in the dock wearing a dark suit and blue tie.

In mitigation, Ms Rafferty said Bradbury's guilty pleas had spared his victims the ordeal of giving evidence in court.

She added: 'Clearly on a human level something has gone very badly wrong in this man's life and thought processes.'

She said Bradbury seemed to have repressed homosexual feelings during puberty and this influenced his behaviour.

Ms Rafferty added that he accepted what he did was 'repugnant'.

'He knows he will not get any understanding or forgiveness because what he did was unforgivable,' she said.

'His medical life may have done some good at some time but that means nothing now.

'He accepts that that was the life which allowed him to commit those offences.'

Mistakes by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) meant Bradbury was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse.

The doctor bought a DVD in 2005 from Azov Films in Canada. The company advertised on its website 'just legal' and 'naturist' films but many were clearly illegal - and were bought by paedophiles in over 50 countries around the world.

The site was finally closed down by Toronto police in the summer of 2012 and concerned officers in Canada soon dispatched the names of its customers to authorities in other countries in an operation called Project Spade.

CEOP was handed a list of 2,235 suspected British paedophiles in July 2012 by Canadian police - but did nothing for months.

Canadian police told British authorities about suspected paedophiles including Bradbury as part of a worldwide operation called Project Spade

It was only when the centre was absorbed by the National Crime Agency last November that Bradbury's name was passed to Suffolk police and his home was raided.

In the intervening time he had continued his abuse and made his trip to the African orphanage.

Among the other suspects named on the list handed over by Canadian authorities was that of teacher Martin Goldberg, who was found dead a day after police first contacted him.

Following the 46-year-old's death, a search of his house in Shoeburyness, Essex was conducted and 7,257 indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet were found.

Three police forces in Britain - Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales - are under investigation for allegedly failing to act on the child porn intelligence, it emerged earlier this month.
