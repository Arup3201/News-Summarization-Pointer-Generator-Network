Ban: Joshua Rushton has been given an Asbo which prevents him from touching cars

A prolific thief has been given an Asbo banning him from touching cars after repeatedly trying to break in to parked vehicles.

Joshua Rushton, a convicted football hooligan, has racked up multiple convictions at the age of just 18.

He was jailed for 12 weeks after police saw him try the door handles of four cars as he walked down the road in his home town of Stockport, Greater Manchester.

Rushton pleaded guilty to theft and four counts of interfering with a vehicle in an attempt to steal at Stockport Magistrates' Court.

In addition, he was handed an Asbo stating that he cannot 'touch or enter any unattended motor vehicle without the express permission of the owner' for the next three years.

He received the unusual punishment after the court heard that he was obsessed with breaking in to cars.

Stephen Gilbertson, from Stockport Police, said: 'He doesn't own a car but he can't go past one without trying the handle or seeing if there's something in it.

'He just can't keep his hands off cars.'

Rushton and Joshua Forrest were seen trying to enter four different cars on the same road on October 15 this year.

Forrest, 20, was also sentenced to 12 weeks in a young offenders institution.

Last week, Rushton was ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work after being convicted of receiving stolen goods, two counts of theft, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and criminal damage.

Earlier this year Rushton, a Manchester City fan, was convicted of causing trouble during a hard-fought derby match against Manchester United at the team's Etihad Stadium.

United won the December 2012 game 3-2 thanks to a dramatic late goal, leading to a flare-up which saw one fan confront defender Rio Ferdinand on the pitch.

Rushton, who was watching the game in a pub because he was banned from stadium, ran into the ground with five minutes left in the match and was seen hurling a bottle and a coin at United fans.

He was given a three-year football banning order and ordered to pay Â£185.
