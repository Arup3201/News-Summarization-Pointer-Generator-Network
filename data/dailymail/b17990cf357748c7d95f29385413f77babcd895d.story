If you've ever left your sunglasses on the beach or in a taxi, help could be at hand.

Designers have revealed the first pairs of 3D printed glasses frames - and say soon we could be able to simply print a replacement pair at home.

London-based 3D printers Digits2Widgets has begun making sunglasses frames for designer Ron Arad's new eyewear line, PQ Eyewear.

Protos, a company based in San Francisco, produces 3D-printed frames that cost around £115. These 'pixelated' frames are designed to look like Lego bricks

The frames made by Digits2Widgets are printed in the closed position. Slashes, like shark gills, are added where the hinges should be to make them open, and sit securely on the wearer's head

Protos, based in San Fransisco, even prints a range of glasses that appear as if they're pixelated.

The Protos frames start at £115, and the company is working on producing tailor-made frames using precise facial measurements.

The Ron Arad frames from Digits2Widgets don't have hinges and are instead made of a single piece of nylon.

They cost £36 to make, and retail from between £400 and £900.

Be warned though, if you're thinking of printing these frames at home, you will need to pay for a specially designed machine that will set you back around £150,000.

The Digits2Widgets frames are designed to be built, or printed, in the closed position.

A series of slashes, similar to gills on a shark, are cut into the frames at the point where a traditional hinge would go. 

This means the glasses stems can be pulled apart in order to allow the glasses to be put on the head. 

When the glasses are removed from the 3D printer, the material memory of the Nylon SLS means the stems revert back to the closed position.

And this means they sit securely on the wearer's head. 

SLS
stands for Selective Laser Sintering and is the process of using lasers
and powder to create layers of nylon that fit together to form a solid 
model.

Tests by Digits2Widgets have found that the frames can be opened and closed more than 500,000 times before the stems start to loosen.

Selective
Laser Sintering (SLS) is a relatively new way of 3D printing that uses a
laser to fuse, or sinter, powder-based materials together.

The powder is put together in layers to form a solid model.

The printer system has of a laser, part chamber, and control system.

The powder is put into a cartridge in the part chamber, and leveled out by a leveling roller.

How SLS printing works

A thin layer of material is spread onto the platform and the laser traces a two-dimensional cross section of the part.

It then fuses the material together.

The
leveling roller pushes material from the powder cartridge across the 
platform, where the next cross section is sintered to the previous.

And so on.

This continues until the part is completed.

Once
the model is complete, it is removed from the part chamber and finished
by removing any loose material and smoothing the visible surfaces.

Layers and strips of material are built and fused together using a 3D printer to complete the finished frames

Dozens of different-styled glasses can be printed at the same time using 3D printers, see left, and Selective Laser Sintering. A close-up of what this process looks like is pictured right

Digits2Widgets say it can make 25 pairs of the glasses every 36 hours.

3D printing is still a relatively new technology, and printers are still expensive.

It can be used to print anything from chocolate, to jewellery, building materials, spare mechanical parts, and even other 3D printers.

Tests are also being carried out to see if 3D printing could be used to print human tissue, and car manufacturers have also experimented with printing replacement parts and panels.
