A Dallas bride-to-be has been left devastated 36 days before she says 'I do' after a mix-up over her doily-covered wedding invitations.

Natalie DeGraffenreid ordered custom, doily-decorated invitations from the Arlington-based company, Art by Ellie. But what she received in the mail was apparently not what she ordered. 

Her distress began when she opened the package from stationary firm - half of her invitations allegedly had the wrong doily design.

DeGraffenreid was so upset about the doilies that she turned to her local ABC TV station to warn others of her experience.

Natalie DeGraffenreid and Cory Teague, who have been engaged since March 2014 and are expected to marry this spring. But the bride-to-be was left devastated after she had a mix-up with wedding invitations she ordered

DeGraffenreid ordered invitations from Arts by Ellie. The company allegedly contacted her to tell her they had ran out of the doily she wanted and ordered a second one, but she didn't realize how different it would be

DeGraffenreid, a nurse, placed her invitation order in early January, paid a $500 deposit and signed the company's contract, she told ABC 8. 

But problems set in when the company allegedly said only half of the invitations for her April wedding were ready, claiming there weren't enough of the same doilies for the entire order.

'When she e-mailed me a few days later and said she didn't have the same pattern - that she was ordering a new one - she said it was different. I didn't know how different,' the bride-to-be said.

'It matters to me. I'm the bride and I'm the one that paid for it,' DeGraffenreid, who has been engaged to Cory Teague since March 2014, added.

One doily the bride-to-be received had swirly designs, while the other was more symmetrical and had more holes, it is reported.

She said that Art by Ellie did not fulfill its part of the transaction, so she has not paid the remainder of the bill. 

After DeGraffenreid contacted the six-year-old stationary company asking for a refund or discount, she said the owner told her a full refund would not be an option and that the bride-to-be's payment was overdue. 

Lauren Heymann, owner of Art by Ellie reportedly said in a statement to ABC that she was 'very sorry she [DeGraffenreid] is so upset about the doilies'.

Heymann said that she offered DeGraffenreid some kind of a refund, but the bride-to-be denies, and said the stationary firm owner instead reminded her of the contract she signed. 

'We are not under contract for a guaranteed specific delivery date, a specific envelope, or a specific doily pattern with your contract,'' DeGraffenreid read from an e-mail she said Heymann sent. 'That means she could give me whatever she wanted... and she did.'

The bride-to-be was so disappointed that she contacted the company and asked for a refund, but she said the company told her she needs to pay in full

 Arts by Ellie owner Lauren Heymann said in a statement that she was 'very sorry' about DeGraffenreid's disappointment with the doilies and said she had tried to give some kind of refund

DeGraffenreid said that she is unsure as to how she will proceed with the invitation situation. But she does hope that other brides-to-be don't have to go through the same experience

DeGraffenreid was contacted earlier this week by an attorney representing Art by Ellie demanding she pay the remainder of her bill, it is alleged. On the Art by Ellie website, the company ensures that customers see their products before they go to print. 

'Of course; you are involved every step of the way. We work with you to get a feel for your event style and then we begin working on your first round of proofs,' the company says on their FAQ page. 

'The first e-mail will usually contain a few concepts and then we'll go from there, making changes until it’s perfect, and we wouldn’t dream of sending anything to the printers without your final approval.'

It is unknown if DeGraffenreid saw her doilies before they reached her by post. 

The bride-to-be told ABC that she's unsure how she will proceed, but she hopes others won't have to go through the same stress she did. 

On the couple's wedding site, which has since been deleted, DeGraffenreid and Teague said they are getting married on April 4.

This isn't the first time DeGraffenreid made headlines during her engagement. 

She and Teague, were in the news in March 2014 after he proposed to her during an awards ceremony for his fire department after two years of dating.

She was shocked at the proposal and had no idea it was coming, according to Fox 4.

DailyMail has attempted to contact Ms Heymann for comment.
