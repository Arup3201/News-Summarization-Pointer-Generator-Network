The mother of a British woman shot dead 
on holiday in Turkey has denied claims her daughter was 
having an affair with the man accused of shooting her.

Cecilia Bury, 87, shook her head and said she was not aware Anne, 56, was having an affair with gardener Veli Acar.

The accusations emerged in the aftermath of the barbaric shooting with locals suggesting he had
flown into a jealous rage after seeing Anne with another man.

Speaking from the Tiryaki Boutique Hotel in Fethiye her brothers said: 'It is completely untrue.'

Cecilia, who was also shot in Monday's savage attack, shook her head, frowned and added: 'No that's not true.'

She was released from hospital on Tuesday was recuperating from her injuries at the boutique hotel, while her two sons made arrangements to repatriate their sister's body to the UK.

In a statement today, Miss Bury's family said they 'cannot comprehend the mentality' of the gunman who killed her and injured her mother Cecilia and son Alex.

They said: 'We would like to thank everyone for their warm wishes and condolences at this very sad time.

'Although our family are still deeply shocked and grieving for Anne, we are pleased to say that both Anne's mother and son are recovering from their injuries and have both been given wonderful care, treatment and support by hospital and consulate staff and many other local people.

'It appears that the person that Anne employed as a general gardener/handyman, to look after her holiday villas, has committed this terrible crime.

'We cannot comprehend the mentality of somebody who would do this to three lovely people who would never harm anybody.

'We would like once again to thank everyone for their kindness and offers of help - they are a great source of strength to us.

'We are sure that you will understand that we would now like peace and privacy at this time so that we can get on with everything we need to do.'

Earlier today, Anne's son Alex Bury, 24,  said he tried to reason with alleged attacker, Veli Acar, before he opened fire on Miss Bury, 56.

Speaking from his bed in Mugla University Hospital, Mr Bury, 24, said he recognised the gunman as Acar, their gardener, who was said to have been in a relationship with Miss Bury.

He claimed Acar had threatened the family earlier that weekend but was later released by police and returned, armed, to the Bury villa in the resort of Dalyan at around 5am on Monday.

Mr Bury, who was being treated for a leg injury, told The Times : 'I tried to reason with him.

'I told him it didn't have to be this way.

'He lifted the gun to his shoulder and gestured for me to go through to my mother and grandmother's room.

'They had heard me talking and had locked themselves in the room.'

Miss Bury reportedly ran up three flights of stairs and bolted herself into the bathroom.

But Mr Acar shot off the lock before shooting her four times as she cowed on the floor.

Acar then gunned her down as she cowered in on the floor, it was reported.

The
Turkish ministry of culture and tourism confirmed the death of Ms Bury,
who lived in the North Yorkshire village of Swainby, and said her son, 
Alex, remained in hospital

Miss Bury's mother Cecilia, 87, was discharged after treatment.

Acar is said to have given himself up after the shooting and is due in court.

Anne
Bury was celebrating her 56th birthday when she was killed, while son 
Alex and mother Cecilia, 87, were taken to hospital with serious 
injuries.

Their attacker had been arrested less than 48 hours before for apparently making death threats against the family.

But
he was released, and shortly afterwards arrived at the luxury villa in 
the picturesque coastal resort of Dalyan armed with a pump-action 
shotgun.

The shootings happened in the early hours of Monday, after a party to mark Miss Bury’s birthday.

The
46-year-old gunman, named by locals as Turkish gardener and handyman 
Velli Acar, appears to have targeted the family in some kind of revenge 
attack.

He blasted Mrs Bury 
in the back and shot her grandson in the leg. Miss Bury fled in  terror 
up three flights of stairs and bolted herself in her bathroom. But Acar 
blasted the lock and reportedly shot her four times at point-blank range
as she cowered on the tiled floor. She died at the scene.

Her son and widowed mother were taken by ambulance to separate hospitals.

Mrs
Bury was later discharged and Alex was said to be in a ‘stable’ 
condition after undergoing successful surgery to repair a damaged artery
in his leg.

Locals
in Dalyan claimed that Miss Bury may have been in a relationship with 
Acar and the killing was probably a crime of passion.

Neighbour Ozman Tugcu said: ‘I’d seen 
them out together occasionally and thought they were a couple. But they 
were both quiet and kept themselves to themselves.’

But
another neighbour said the row was over money, and Acar had been 
accused of pocketing cash intended for other tradesmen for work at the 
villa.

Police have refused to comment on the motive for the shooting.

Mr
Tugcu described the British family as ‘quiet and respectable people’. 
He said he was alerted to the shooting by the arrival of police. 

Alex Bury planned to become a doctor, according the family's neighbours in north Allerton

‘I
was horrified to see the elderly lady brought out of the house,’ he 
said. ‘She was covered in blood. I was sure she was dead and am 
astonished she survived. It’s a really dreadful thing to happen.’

The gunman later gave himself up to police and was remanded in  custody yesterday ahead of a formal court appearance.

Miss Bury and her family had been going to stay in their villa in the tiny fishing village for six years.

Acar,
described as a heavy drinker, had been reported to police over alleged 
death threats and was arrested on Saturday. He was held overnight for 
questioning and released the following day.

Locals said the suspect also owned a boat and ran trips for tourists in the resort.

One
resident said he would regularly drink a bottle of a strong local wine.

‘Veli was a quiet man but we think he had an alcohol problem,’ he 
said.

The Bury family had  decorated their villa with bunting and 
balloons for the birthday party by the pool on Sunday.

Yesterday blood smears could be seen on the marble floors beneath the decorations.

Friends and neighbours at home in Britain paid tribute to the dead woman and expressed their shock.

Miss Bury, a former nurse from North Yorkshire, worked as a risk manager for a Saudi-based medical services company.

Neighbour Stephen Garbut said the family are 'the nicest people you could ever wish to meet'. Pictured is the Bury family's UK home in Northallerton, North Yorkshire

She had a masters degree in law and a degree in midwifery.

Mr Bury, her only child, had graduated from university and was working in medical research while planning to train as a doctor.

Miss
Bury lived in a bungalow in Swainby, North Yorkshire, but spent 
prolonged periods abroad working in Saudi Arabia and visiting her 
holiday home in Turkey. Neighbour Steve Garbutt, 72, said: ‘They were a 
lovely family and this has come as a terrible shock.

‘You
just don’t expect anything like this to happen. [She] was an excellent 
neighbour and was always friendly when you spoke to her.

Neighbours said the suspect, Velli Acar, was a quiet man who used to run boat trips for tourists

‘I
never ever heard a bad word, or a cross word or anything like that from
any of them. How on earth they got into this situation I cannot 
imagine.’

Local resident 
Irene Cousans, 60, added: ‘They never caused any  trouble and were 
always very friendly. I think everyone in the  village is in shock. I 
don’t understand how this has happened.

‘Anne’s mum used to visit a lot too and she was just as lovely as her daughter and grandson.’

A Foreign Office spokesman  said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family at this  difficult time.’
