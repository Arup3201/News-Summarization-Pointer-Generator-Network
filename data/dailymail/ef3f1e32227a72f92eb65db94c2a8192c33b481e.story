Hermione Norris admits that if she had the money she would go to an American plastic surgeon and get 'the lot'

Hermione Norris is looking down at her chest in faux disgust. 'I want my boobs done,' she says, cupping them.

'But I just want them lifted a bit, not implants, and I don't think they do that. And I'd have my thighs tightened because all the muscle and skin tone's gone.

'And I'd have the cellulite shlooshed out of my tummy. And I'd have that wattle thing done, under my neck.

'Oh yes, and hair implants – maybe a hair transplant. If I had the money, I'd go to the best plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go there...'

It's fair to say that Hermione isn't quite as I'd expected. She looks just like the cool, composed, very middle-class Karen Marsden from Cold Feet, or Spooks' tough Ros Myers, or even DCI Carol Jordan from Wire In The Blood – all sleek, beautifully fitting clothes, discreet jewellery and immaculate skin.

But actually she's warm, funny, surprisingly open and brilliantly messy. 'Do you want to see the inside of my bag?' she says, grabbing an enormous soft leather tote.

'Look! There's sand, sweets, salt sachets, pens, drinks, packets of crisps, Lego, plasters. I like to be prepared and I know most things I need for all eventualities are there.'

Which is all very interesting, but we're actually here to talk about The Crimson Field – a new BBC1 drama series set in a field hospital in France in the First World War, but filmed in the Cotswolds.

Hermione, who's long been fascinated by the war and in her 20s made pilgrimages to the French battlefields, plays stern but compassionate Matron Grace Carter.

'It was very emotional. That level of loss – what must it have done to those poor men? To be a good nurse you'd have to have a level of  detachment. I'd just want to take them home with me. My mother's a nurse, but I couldn't do it.'

Her mother sounds more capable than most, single-handedly raising four children after her husband walked out when Hermione was just four.

'I don't know why he left – but I would imagine there was someone else involved, knowing my dad. There were four of us under six. It was really hard for my mum.'

And her dad – what was he like? 'Great fun, naughty, charismatic, twinkly... trouble. He made me laugh. I saw him every Sunday. He was good at gifts and going out for nice meals but not the sort of man you should marry.' He died when Hermione was 21. 'It had a profound impact. It was really, really difficult. It was like the removal of a limb.'

So Hermione immersed herself in work. 'Suddenly I was at Colchester Theatre, sharing a dressing room with a woman who drank gin out of the bottle and went on and on about her cats.'

'If I had the money, I'd go to the best 
plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my 
clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go 
there...'

For years she alternated between theatre and anything that paid the bills – walking around shopping centres in a moose outfit and selling double glazing. Until,  in 1997, she was cast in Cold Feet, the cult ITV drama co-starring James Nesbitt, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst and Helen Baxendale.

The show ran for five series and served as a launch pad for its stars, who at one stage were reputed to be being paid £70,000 each an episode. (She looks a bit blank when I mention the money today, as well she might after saying last month she now shops at Asda because British TV pays such meagre wages.)

Much has been made of the differences between the cast over the years – so did they get on at all?

'We were a very eclectic group,' is her careful answer. 'A really different bunch of people. But it worked.'

Are any of them still friends? 'I'm 
godmother to John Thomson's little girl. And I worked with Robert 
recently. And Jimmy's been away in New Zealand doing The Hobbit... With 
Jimmy you always knew. I remember a helicopter arriving on set to pick 
him up, and John saying, "Oh look, there's Jimmy's career taking off," 
as the rest of us got into a minibus.'

Which brings us neatly back to hair transplants and, in passing, Jimmy Nesbitt's very natural-looking new thatch.

'Jimmy's is amazing. You've got to have the cash to do it really, really well. I'm so pleased for him. As an actor it makes a difference to your castability as well.' So what about Botox? 'I would...' And has she? 'I'm not telling you! If you have surgery, don't speak about it. But I'm not against it, obviously.'

It's ironic that while she played the wife with children in Cold Feet, Hermione was the last of the cast to settle down. For years, she found herself attracted to charming but unsuitable men – not unlike her father.

Then in 2002, at the age of 35, she met Simon Wheeler, a writer and TV producer, when she was filming Wire In The Blood with Robson Green. They married the same year and now have a son, Wilf, nine, and daughter, Hero, six. 'I just thought, "Oh **** it's you!" It was very straightforward. He's kind, bright, my best friend.' At 40, he's also seven years younger than her. Is she conscious of the age gap? 'I'm sure as I get older I will be. I need that work done!'

The family live in Dorset and, between filming commitments, spend their time watching mostly American DVD box sets. 'I'd absolutely love to be in an American drama, but I couldn't go over there and peddle my wares,' she says.

'I'd want them to come to me and just offer me an amazing part. I'd never have to work again and I'd be able to get my plastic surgery done then. I reckon I'd need about a quarter of a million.'

Hermione is brilliant. She may have a tendency to play dauntingly capable women but she's great company. And you never know, one day, if Hollywood does finally come calling she might end up looking rather different.

'I'd see you in a few months and my boobs would be up here and I'd look amazing!' Let's just hope she leaves the hair transplants to James Nesbitt.

The Crimson Field starts tomorrow at 9pm on BBC1.
