No kingpins or so-called 'Mr Bigs' of the drug smuggling ring that supplied the Bali Nine operation have ever been found.

Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who will be executed within days for their role in the plot to traffic 8kg of heroin from Indonesia to Australia, are the most senior figures to have ever faced charges over the conspiracy.

But key players in the operation - including a Nepalese drug trafficker, a Thai prostitute and a Sydney-based lotto winner - managed to slip through the cracks following the Australian Federal Police sting.

Less than two weeks after the Bali Nine arrests in 2005, Indonesian police shot Nepalese drug trafficker Man Singh Ghale dead and claimed he was the king pin of the drug ring that supplied the heroin

Following the Bali Nine arrests, Indonesian and Thai authorities let Thai prostitute Cherry Likit Bannakorn – who brought the heroin to Bali and was a key link to the 'Mr Bigs' of the operation – escape arrest

The AFP had been tracking Chan and Sukumaran  ahead of their April 17 2005 arrests.

Investigations to find and prosecute to international smuggling ring behind the Bali Nine plot later established that the heroin came from Myanmar, smuggled via Thailand.

But following the Bali Nine arrests, Indonesian and Thai authorities let Thai prostitute Cherry Likit Bannakorn – who brought the heroin to Bali and was a key link to the 'Mr Bigs' of the operation – escape arrest.

On April 8, Likit Bannakorn met Chan in a Kuta hotel room and gave him a silver suitcase filled with 'brown packages'.

But on April 18, the day after the nine were arrested, Likit Bannakorn slipped out of Indonesia.

Authorities were aware of her alleged role in the Bali Nine operation and she was later arrested by Thai police as she tried to enter at the Thai-Malaysian border.

But she was set free and allowed to enter the country, with Thai officials claiming Indonesian investigators did not have adequate extradition documentation for them to detain her. She is still wanted by Interpol.

Another figure who will never  explain his role in the Bali Nine operation is Nepalese drug trafficker Man Singh Ghale.

On April 27, Indonesian police shot Ghale dead and claimed he was the king pin of the drug ring that supplied heroin to the Bali Nine.

Ghale was at his home in East Jakarta with two young women singing karaoke when Indonesian police entered, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

At the time, authorities said police shot him in his chest because he resisted arrest and tried to escape, labelling him a 'dangerous fugitive'.

But the story told by police was contradicted by four witness accounts from neighbours and street vendors who said he was shot in the leg, then was handcuffed and walked to a police car.

That was the last time they saw him alive.

One drink seller named Hatta said an officer told him the raid was related 'to Bali', while another unidentified witness suggested he was killed because police officers were involved in Ghale's alleged drug crimes, the Herald reported.

Nepalese police said he had a long history of drug smuggling, having set up his base in Indonesia where he supplied heroin from Pakistan and other countries to places like Australia and the U.S.

But months after his death the Australian Federal Police admitted Ghale was not the 'king pin' of the Bali Nine smuggling ring.

The real mastermind of the trafficking plot is allegedly enjoying an extravagant lifestyle in Sydney, having won $5 million in the lottery after he escaped all convictions.

The unnamed drug lord had been the subject of previous police investigations into drug trafficking before the 2005 bust.

Chan and Sukumaran have never exposed the identity or the person or people they were working for, fearing they would put their families in Australia in danger.

Chan and Sukumaran were the so-called organisers of the group of nine Australians, supplying them with SIM cards so they could stay in contact in Bali and leading them through the final preparations before they attempted to board their flights to Australia while carrying narcotics.

On Thursday, Bali officials signalled the beginning of the end for the pair, with permission granted to move them from Kerobokan jail to their execution place.

Momock Bambang Samiarso, head of Bali Provincial Prosecutors, said a meeting on Thursday afternoon confirmed the Bali Nine pair would be transferred to be executed outside of Bali.

A meeting on Friday will confirm the date of their transfer.

Chan, Sukumaran and their families will be given the required 72 hours notice of their executions.

The meeting came after heartfelt pleas in parliament by Julie Bishop and Tanya Plibersek, and the Indonesian foreign minister's reiteration that the men be dealt the ultimate punishment.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said she had received letters from both women, and phone calls from the minister.

Her replies were clear and consistent, she said.

'I have told Julie that this is not against a country, this is not against nationals of a certain country, but this is against a crime, against an extraordinary crime,' she told reporters in Jakarta.

'We will keep on communicating, explaining, in consistent language like that.' 

A meeting on Friday will confirm the date of their transfer
