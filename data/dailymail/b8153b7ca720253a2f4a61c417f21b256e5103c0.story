Women in Brooklyn are the pickiest in the country, a new study claims.

The signature scruffy beard and plaid shirt combination in the hipster capital are apparently no longer enough to score a date - but the ladies say the men just aren't trying.

Dating website AYI.com examined more than 453,000 interactions of single women between the ages of 18 and 99 and discovered singles in the New York City borough were the least likely to respond to online dating messages.

After Brooklyn, women in Detroit were the least likely to message back followed by Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Los Angeles.

However, guys looking for love should target Jersey City, New Jersey, which is home to online daters who are much more likely to respond to messages.

Those from Miami, St. Louis, Las Vegas and Portland were also less picky when it came to prospective lovers.

But Rosalie Ryan, 22, from Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood complained that the local men were simply lazy.

'Brooklyn men don't have enough confidence to just come up to you and ask you on a date,' she told The New York Post, adding that she recently closed her online-dating account because her inbox was overflowing with 'stupid messages.'

'Online dating has ruined dating. It makes guys more lazy and less in the moment.'

Edna Velasco, 27, of Williamsburg, said she has dated 20 men on OkCupid this year and only one was passable.

She told The Post she generally judges an admirer by their subject line alone.

'When they start with "Baby" or "Honey" â€” never mind! Or "I like Latinas!" Delete, delete, delete!" said Velasco. 'Some guy said, "Hello, do you like sex?" That's the first thing he says to me!'

She explained that one disastrous date, her suitor bought a $2 slice of pizza with pocket change and then asked her for 50 cents because he didn't have enough.
