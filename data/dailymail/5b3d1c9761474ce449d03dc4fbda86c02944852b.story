The blonde pre-op transsexual model who was allegedly punched, bit and spat at by her FDNY calendar boyfriend was grilled on the stand yesterday.

Testifying in Manhattan Supreme Court, Claudia Charriez, 31, was questioned about her sexually-transmitted disease, experiences as an escort and deceased ex-boyfriend as the defense went on the attack.

Attorneys for Taylor Murphy, 29, attempted to damage Charriez's credibility during fierce questioning. Their client stands accused of a vicious attack on the transgender model in August 2011.

According to the New York Daily News, Murphy's defense attorney Jason Berland began by asking the former call-girl, who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man, about her venereal disease.

'You (worked as an escort) knowing that you could potentially transmit that disease?' asked Berland.

'I was an escort, not a prostitute. I do not have sex for money,' Charriez replied.

'Whether or not I chose to engage in sexual activity with someone - protected - was my choice,' she said. 'What does this have anything to do with him hurting me?'

Charriez, dressed in a black mini-skirt, blazer and heels, endured over four hours of exhausting cross-examination in the courtroom yesterday.

Berland asked the model as to why she charged her clients $300 per hour if she wasn’t offering sex. The defense claims that at one point her hourly rate jumped to $600.

'Dinner dates. Accompanied them on many different occasions,' replied Charriez.

The defense inquired if the model had been taking estrogen over the period in question.

'I don’t need hormone therapy because at a very young age I was castrated,'  Charriez claimed.

Berland then asked her about a deceased former boyfriend, allegedly the subject of tension between Murphy and Charriez.

The model was upset by this line of questioning and screamed 'You shouldn’t talk about dead people' as she was escorted out of the courtroom.

Murphy is accused of assaulting his ex-lover, Charriez, in the summer of 2011. 

The firefighter previously worked 
with Engine 59 and Engine 7, Ladder 1 in lower Manhattan. He is best 
known as Mr March in a 2011 firefighters calendar. But the FDNY said the calendar Murphy posed in was not affiliated with the department.

At yesterday's hearing an unidentified woman waving a copy of the calendar shouted 'I love you Taylor!' before being bundled out of the court by officials.

'Hunky': Taylor Murphy is best known for his topless firefighters calendar. In court yesterday a woman burst into court with the image, screaming 'I love you Taylor.'

In opening statements of Murphy's trial on Thursday, prosecutors claimed Murphy 'grabbed her with his massive hands' during the August dispute in their room at the Hotel Metro on 35th street.

'He punched her in the back on the right side, by the shoulder blade, assistant district attorney Kevin Rooney said, according to The New York Post.

'Enough to make her fear what was coming as he slammed the door shut... the two struggled. He bit her on the forearm.

'Ultimately he pinned her down on the bed... all 240 pounds of her on top of her, into her, until she felt like she was literally engulfed by the bed.'

His voice rising, Rooney continued: 'He spit at her. Covering her mouth so she couldn't scream.'

In his opening statement, defense lawyer Berland described the couple as having 'a textbook dysfunctional relationship.'

Berland told jurors that Charriez had been working as a prostitute and the love affair 'unfortunately went south' when Murphy discovered the woman was sick with 'a venereal disease.' 

'Because he loved her he begged her to stop working as an escort,' he said, according to The Post.

'But his pleas fell on deaf ears' and Murphy, who is bisexual and has a penchant for trannies, started seeing other people, which is when Charriez embarked on a campaign of threats and allegations against the firefighter.

But the prosecution claims the breakup and subsequent beat-down was sparked by Murphy's drunken jealousy.

On a separate evening, which ended in blows, the couple visited Times Square strip club Flashdancers where, according to The Post, Murphy wound up getting a lap dance and Charriez retaliated by chatting up patrons who mistook her for an employee.

Tempers flared and they took their dispute outside.

She called him various expletives, the prosecutor told jurors. Then started screaming 'Rape! Rape!' the defense lawyer claimed.

Murphy allegedly slammed his date into a phone booth and dragged her down the sidewalk by the hair before the pair dashed back to their room in separate cabs.

There, they eventually kissed and made up, prosecutors admitted.

'She realized she could not stop him,' Rooney said. 'She began to cry and she pulled him closer to her, then he started crying and they sat up in the room for several minutes.'

But the two made plans to see each other the next afternoon, the defense lawyer said, while Charriez' lawyers admit they did get together soon after the brawl.

Murphy is charged with felony strangulation and felony violation of an order of protection barring him from contacting his alleged victim, which he reportedly did 1,400 times in the space of three months in the form of text messages and phone calls.
