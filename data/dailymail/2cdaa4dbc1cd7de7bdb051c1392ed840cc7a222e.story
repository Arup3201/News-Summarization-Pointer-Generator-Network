A family were left distraught after a lorry driver with road rage tried to break into their car on the motorway - because they had beeped at his bad driving.

The thug was captured on video jumping out of his cab during rush hour on the six-lane motorway approaching the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland yesterday - one of the most congested crossings in the UK. 

He is seen pulling at the door handle of the family's car, where a two-year-old sat in the back seat before swearing and returning to his vehicle.

The lorry, bearing the name Carr's Flour Mills, appeared to cross into the lane occupied by a motorist with a camera on his dashboard.

The driver gave the lorry driver a lengthy beep on his horn before driving off.

Seconds later, the lorry driver comes back into view, making an obscene gesture at the family and shouting 'stop the car'.

The footage then shows the driver leaping from his cab and dashing across the A90.

Off camera, he is heard pulling at the door handle of the family's car, who had a two-year-old girl in the back seat. 

After swearing at the family, the tattooed lorry driver gives up and runs back to his cab.

The driver of the car, who does not want to be identified, said: 'I think he backed off when he spotted my two-year-old daughter on the back seat.

'My daughter was distraught and traumatised.'

The lorry, bearing the name Carr's Flour Mills. The company has been contacted but have not yet commented 

The video, uploaded on to the Edinburgh's Worst Drivers website, lead to calls for the unnamed driver to be sacked.

One comment said: 'Has to get the sack for this violent, intimidating behaviour.' 

The driver has been since been sacked. 

A spokesperson for Carr's Flour Mills said the driver was not an employee, but had been sent by an agency to provide holiday cover. 

She said: 'We wish to confirm that this behaviour is disgraceful and totally unacceptable to Carr’s Flour Mills. 

'The driver was not one of our employees, but an agency driver providing holiday cover. He has been removed from our vehicles, and the agency is investigating the matter.

'We regret any distress caused to the family concerned.'

The agency added: 'We have been made aware of this incident and the behaviour of the driver in question is clearly not acceptable under any circumstances.

'We operate very stringent recruitment procedures. We are conducting an investigation into this incident but we can confirm that this driver will not be working for us in the future.

'This driver had been with us for some time and his conduct had not previously given cause for concern. 

'Nevertheless we would repeat that this incident is totally unacceptable and we regret any distress caused to the family in question.'
