Former waitress Heidi Agan is determined to be the best Kate Middleton lookalike in the world - but the role has just got more complicated thanks to the Duchess' pregnancy.

Mother-of-two Heidi hasn't gone to the extreme of getting pregnant again herself but has instead invested in a number of belly prosthetics so she can continue to replicate Kate's look. 

'As Kate grows I will too - to be authentic I thought it was important,' she told the BBC, adding that she has had a 'bump made in various sizes'.

Heidi, from Corby, Northamptonshire, earns £650-a-day as the Duchess' doppelganger through public and media appearances.

The 32 year old single mother has worked hard to mimic Kate's clothes, mannerisms and posture since she quit her job at a Frankie and Benny's restaurant to become a professional lookalike.

She made the career move after people kept coming up to her convinced she was Kate.

She has had to spend some of her earnings on replicating Kate's designer wardrobe including buying the blue Issa dress Kate wore when she and Prince William announced their engagement and a £300 copy of her Alexander McQueen evening wedding gown.

The Duchess is currently five months pregnant and is still not showing much of a bump. She has worn clothes she has been pictured in before at recent public appearances - albeit less tightly fitted - so has not yet been seen in maternity clothes.

As a result, Heidi said it's currently not as easy for her to copy Kate's style.

She said: 'It's difficult at the moment as she's not big enough yet to change her 
entire wardrobe so it's difficult to see how she's going to dress it.'

Heidi was given a taste of what Kate's maternity wear may look like when the Daily Mail used her as a model in a 'dressing the royal bump' fashion piece last year.

Aside from what clothes to wear, Heidi, who has a son, Blake, 11 and daughter, Abigail, four, is having to get used to having a baby bump again.

She wrote on Twitter earlier this month: 'picked up my 'baby bump' today, how strange.'

But despite the fact she'll have to carry some extra weight for a few months, Heidi said she has no regrets about becoming a lookalike.

She said: 'It’s a huge difference from working in a restaurant and it pays better. It’s a really fun job as I’m doing something different every day.'
