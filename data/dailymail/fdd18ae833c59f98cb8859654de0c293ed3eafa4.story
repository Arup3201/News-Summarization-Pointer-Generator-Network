The alleged rapist who was lynched by a mob in India offered his victim £50 to keep quiet about the attack, she has claimed. 

Shocking pictures showed the angry mob of 2,000 people after they broke into a prison, kidnapped the man, stripped him naked and mercilessly beat him to death in front of a frenzied crowd. 

The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college on February 24, and he was arrested a day later. 

Now the alleged rape survivor has spoken out, accusing the lynched man of giving her £50 to not tell anyone about the attack.

Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later

Offer: The woman says that the man offered her £50 to keep quiet about the alleged attack

Speaking anonymously to a local TV station, the woman said: 'The accused person was my neighbour. 

'It was only after the incident...he told me, he gave me the money to keep silent...I took the money and gave it at the police station.'

The pictures showed the mob after they overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man.

According to local media reports, he died while being dragged four miles through the streets as people beat and pelted him with stones. 

It was reported that the crowd tore down two gates before dragging him to the town's clock tower.

It was said they also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. 

Several people were injured when police used batons and opened fire, while officers were hurt when the mob pelted them with stones in Nagaland state in northeast India. 

A 25-year-old believed to be part of the mob was injured when police opened fire and he later died in hospital. 

The police later removed the man's body. 

Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express

Protesters: A mass rally was held in Dimapur by those who oppose the rape of a student last month

But the family of the lynched man have maintained his innocence and say the medical report of the rape complainant proves that she was not sexually assaulted.

The man has been named by Indian media as Syed Sarif Uddin Khan and his brother Jamal said the killing was 'politically motivated' and accused police of 'falsely implicating his brother on behest of Naga groups, who want to root out non-tribals from the state'.

Nagaland's indigenous tribal groups, especially the largest Naga tribe, have for years accused the growing population of Bengali-speaking Muslims from nearby Assam state and Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and usurping resources.

Nagas have previously campaigned to evict Bengali-speaking immigrants from their territory, who they claim entice local girls into marriage for getting tribal status.

Jamaluddin, an Indian army sergeant, accused Nagaland's government of 'deliberately dubbing him as a Bangladeshi... to justify the killing'.

'The girl's medical report didn't confirm rape but still my brother was jailed and then handed over to the mob who lynched him just because he was a Bengali-speaking person.

'There are multiple members of our family serving in the Army. How could they have killed him claiming he was Bangladeshi? My brother was made a scapegoat.' 

Police had initially claimed that the man was an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant.

'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it

India is in midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student.

The incident, which sparked outrage both in India and around the world, highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the country.

The Indian government has also asked YouTube to block access to the documentary, claiming that its broadcast violated certain key agreements with the filmmaker.

But the Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch the documentary, which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'.

The documentary, called 'India's Daughter', was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack.

The film by award-winning Briton Leslee Udwin, who produced 1999 indie hit East is East, was due to air on the BBC and Indian news channel NDTV to mark International Women's Day this Sunday.

But it was dropped by NDTV following the ban and the BBC brought forward its screening to Wednesday, citing a strong public interest.

India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowed there would be consequences for the Corporation, telling NDTV: 'We had asked to not release the documentary but BBC still released it.

'We will investigate and the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) will take action accordingly. The conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly. I won't comment any further.'

Protest: The woman's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens

The hour-long documentary aired as part of the long-running Storyville series on BBC Four, and is believed to have been accessed by many in India online.

The victim's family showed their support for the film, saying the rapist's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think.

The victim's father, who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies, told NDTV the film was 'the bitter truth'.

'Everyone should watch the film,' he said. 'If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free?'

The victim's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed Singh's views were widespread in India.

Horror: The crew obtained an interview with killer Mukesh Singh, who said the student was to blame

'I don't care what the government does, bans the film, doesn't ban the film, the only thing I know is that nobody is afraid,' she said. 'It is not only Mukesh who thinks like this.'

Mukesh Singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012.

Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack.

The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death.

She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines.

Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. 

Many in the country still believe that women are subservient - illustrated by convict Singh, who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected.

'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back,' he said. 'She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after 'doing her', and only hit [her friend] the boy.'

He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two' and insisted: 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night.

'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal.

'Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. About 20 per cent of girls are good.'
