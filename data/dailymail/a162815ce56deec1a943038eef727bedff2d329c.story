A police dog shot in the face in the line of duty while confronting a gunman has been deemed well enough to go home by the end of the week.

Bruno, a seven-year-old German shepherd, underwent several surgeries after his jaw was shattered and lung damaged, while a bullet was lodged close to his heart.

But Anaheim Police Department has now announced he has made a strong recovery.

He should be released from Yorba Regional Animal Hospital on Friday ahead of his retirement from police work.

'With
 expert care from Yorba Regional Animal Hospital, Bruno is now well 
enough to go home and continue his recovery,' said the Anaheim Police 
Department in a statement.

'Bruno
 will make only a brief appearance at this conference, as he is just 
being released from care and it is anticipated he will need time to 
adjust.'

In March, Bruno received a blood transfusion from another dog on the force, such was his condition.

The
 dog, the most experienced K-9 on the unit, was shot when trying to 
apprehend a suspect who fired at probation officers who were at the home
 of a man they were checking in on.The man was with two friends at the 
time, both of whom ran after spotting the officers.

One
 of the officers walked down an alley to see if he could find the men 
when he was shot at, according to Lt Tim Schmidt, an Anaheim Police 
spokesman.

When Bruno and 
his partner, Officer RJ Young arrived about an hour later, the K9 went 
searching for the men. When the dog found one of the them hiding by a 
trash bin in the courtyard of a nearby apartment complex, according to 
the Orange County Register, the perpetrator fired several shots at the 
dog and officers, with one of the bullets striking Bruno in his jaw.

Officers
 fired back, killing 21-year-old Robert Moreno Jr. The man who probation
 officers were set to interview was taken into custody, but the third 
man escaped. Police say all three are suspected gang members.

Officer
 Young took his injured partner to the Animal Hospital, where Bruno 
underwent three-hour surgery. Since the round traveled from his jaw into
 his chest area, veterinarians had to remove part of Bruno's lung. They 
also had to reconstruct his lower jaw.
