A janitor at an elementary school in New Jersey responsible for causing a blaze that essentially burned the entire building to the ground over the weekend says he's sorry for what happened and he's just thankfully nobody was injured.

Jerome C. Higgins, 48, is a custodian at the James Monroe Elementary School in Edison. On Saturday, Higgins tossed a lit cigarette into a trash can in the custodians office.

About 7:45 p.m., the lit cigarette had grown into a huge blaze that ultimately consumed much of the building.

Oops: A janitor at a New Jersey elementary school nearly burned the entire building down with a cigarette

'I’m sorry I just can’t believe this, my heart goes to the children,'
 Higgins told Pix11.com.  'As long as nobody was hurt, that’s God’s grace.'

It took firefighters more than three hours to extinguish the fire caused by Higgins' cigarette, and nearly a dozen were treated for smoke inhalation.

Luckily, no other injuries were reported.

Higgins has been issued a summons for a petty disorderly persons offense for smoking inside the school.

Under New Jersey law, 'smoking and/or carrying lighted tobacco materials' in a school is against the law.

According to Pix11, the school is home to about 500 kindergarten through fifth-grade students.

Sorry: Janitor Jerome Higgins says he's just glad that none of the children were hurt in the fire he caused

The school is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.

'I think it was very careless mistake by someone I trusted,' school district Supt. Richard O’Malley said during a meeting for parents in the auditorium of a local high school.

Authorities say that the summons issued to Higgins is the most they can do under the law - because there was no intent to burn the school down, or start a fire at all, the janitor can't be charged with arson.

Some parents aren't thrilled with the charges, and say Higgins' demeanor as the school burned was a little odd.

Classes canceled: The students at James Madison will not have class again until Wednesday and will use classrooms at a local college

'The thing that I thought was a little unusual was he was pretty calm,' Edison resident Karen Halo tells CBSNew York. 'Like if I was the last person in the 
building and the building was in a fire, I don’t know if I would be 
quite so calm and collected.'

Students will not have classes until Wednesday when they will use classrooms at Middlesex County College for lessons.
