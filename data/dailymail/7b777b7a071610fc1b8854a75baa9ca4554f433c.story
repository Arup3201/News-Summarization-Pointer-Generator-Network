Bandidos enforcer Toby Mitchell allegedly threatened to shoot dead a man and his baby girl if he wasn't given $300,000

Mr Mitchell was charged with a string of offences including extortion with threats to kill, extortion with threat to inflict serious injury, assault, blackmail and carrying a prohibited firearm.

He didn't apply for bail when he appeared in court on Sunday and was remanded in custody to reappear in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

Speaking outside court, lawyer Theo Magazis said Mr Mitchell, 39, would fight the charges. The Sun Herald reported that two of Mr Mitchell’s associates later threw a milk crate at the media and screamed ‘f--- off’.

Mr Mitchell, who was charged with a string of offences, has already survived two shootings

Mr Mitchell has survived two shootings. He was shot five times in the back outside a Brunswick gym in 2011 and was again shot in March last year after more than 30 rounds were fired at a Melton bikie clubhouse.

Police allege Mr Mitchell demanded $300,000 with threats to shoot dead a man and baby girl. Mr Mitchell, who was wearing a black Adidas track suit and light blue track pants in court, said nothing.

Mr Magazis also told the court Mr Mitchell needed his diet monitored in custody, because one kidney was functioning at just 30 per cent.

Magistrate Ross Betts requested a medical examination for Mr Mitchell, and also ordered the names of alleged victims be removed from documents provided to the media.

The court was told on Sunday that Mr Mitchell needed his diet monitored in custody, because one kidney was functioning at just 30 per cent
