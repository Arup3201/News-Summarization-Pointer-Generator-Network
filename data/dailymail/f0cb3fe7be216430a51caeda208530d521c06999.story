Locals in a quiet country town have paid homage to the humble pumpkin by holding their annual festival to celebrate the vegetable they credit for saving them from a devastating drought.

Residents of Goomeri in south-east Queensland, population 450, have taken part in a series of events involving the locally grown produce including pumpkin shotput, pumpkin bowls and the blue riband event of pumpkin rolling, which involves competitors hurling the orange food stuff down a steep hill in the centre of town.

For the last weekend in May, the number of people in the normally sleepy truck stop swells to 14,000 as competitors flock from as far afield as Europe and other parts of Australia to join in the Goomeri Pumpkin Festival.

Celebrations - which began in 1997 to bring the community together after a devastating drought - culminate in the annual pumpkin roll, which has been dubbed Australia's version of England's centuries-old cheese rolling contest in Gloucestershire.

Roads are closed and spectators watch from behind barriers as the vegetable is tossed down Hodge Street.

There is no one more dedicated to the roll than Goomeri resident Margaret Geritz who was born on the street where the event is held.

'It's our eighteenth (festival), I missed the first one but I'm rolling my 17th time,' the 83-year-old said.

The 450-person population of Goomeri grows to 14,000 at the festival that started in 1997 - to help local businesses who were heavily impacted by the drought

Ms Geritz said she kept up the tradition because it was a lot of fun.

The festival's success has come as a surprise to its co-ordinator Trish McArthur.

Her daughter, Mandy McArthur - who is also on the organising committee - said her mum had eaten her words since the festival's popularity.

Tens of thousands of spectators stand behind barriers to ensure no injuries or interference

'It started out because we were in a really bad drought and had a couple of think tank meetings as to how we could get people into Goomeri as businesses weren't doing well with the drought,' Mandy said.

'There was a Canadian lady here who was rolling pumpkins down the hill to feed her cattle and she suggested we should have a pumpkin festival and Mum actually said 'it won't work'.

'In the first year we had about 30 stalls and 800 people turn up. Now that has grown to our maximum of 250 stalls and 14,000 people. Mum's eating her words a bit.'

The event's popularity, in part, is due to the efforts of more than 120 volunteers. Some helped slice and dice half a tonne of the vegetable for the well-guarded secret pumpkin soup recipe - only available on the day.

One of the events at the festival include the Giant Pumpkin Competition
