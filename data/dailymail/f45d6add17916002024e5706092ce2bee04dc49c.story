Children aged ten should be given more school lessons about illegal drugs and dangerous new ‘legal highs’, a government adviser said yesterday.

Professor Simon Gibbons, a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said a broader drugs education was needed in  primary and middle schools.

He said the committee should be ‘pushing for’ more information for ten, 11 and 12-year-olds.

The PM's drug adviser, Professor Simon Gibbons of University College London, says that children should be educated about the dangers of 'legal highs' as early as primary school

The father-of two said his elder daughter, aged ten, was already ‘starting to be aware of some of these materials’.

His comments will raise concerns among parents who do not want their children exposed to such advice or who would prefer to handle the issue at home.

Mr Gibbons, a professor of Medicinal Phytochemistry at  University College London, is chairman of the council’s sub-committee on legal highs.

He told a public meeting of the council yesterday: ‘As chairman, I would certainly like to see more done on the education done in primary settings.

‘We had a discussion last week and we want the Department for Education to be involved in this.

‘I always use this as a little girl test. I have two young daughters who are eight and ten and the elder one is certainly at that age when she is starting to be aware of some of these materials.

Education minister Liz Truss said the DfE was taking ¿to ensure children are taught about the harmful effects of drugs¿

'At the primary/middle school phase there’s not enough information on drug education – that’s something we should be pushing for.’

Schools are required by law to cover the harmful effects of drugs on behaviour and health as part of the national science curriculum.

A new national curriculum being introduced in September states that pupils in year six at primary school – those aged ten and 11 – must be taught to ‘recognise the impact of diet, exercise and drugs and lifestyle on the way their bodies function’.

It states ‘pupils should learn how to keep their bodies healthy and how their bodies might be damaged – including how some drugs and other substances can be harmful to the human body’.

They should also explore ‘the relationship between diet, exercise, drugs, lifestyle and health’.

Although Personal, Social and Health Education lessons remain non-compulsory, the Department for Education recommends schools use them to expand the knowledge pupils get in science classes.

Guidance endorsed by ministers says primary pupils should be taught ‘which, why and how commonly available substances and drugs (including alcohol and tobacco) could damage their immediate and future health and safety, that some are legal, some are restricted and some are illegal to own, use and supply to others’.

Further guidance commissioned by ministers contains a series of standards for delivering drugs education in schools, including that ‘the situations, language and images are appropriate for pupils’ maturity, understanding and knowledge’.

Education minister Liz Truss answered a Parliamentary written question last month on drugs education in schools.

Asked by Tory MP Andrew Rosindell what steps the DfE was taking ‘to ensure children are taught about the harmful effects of drugs’, she said: ‘Pupils will learn about the effects of drugs on behaviour and health as part of the new science national curriculum from September 2014. Teachers can also cover the issue through PSHE lessons.’
