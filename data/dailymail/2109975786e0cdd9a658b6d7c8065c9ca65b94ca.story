Police investigating the death of a father-of-two found dead in a chest freezer at home are examining the possibility he may have fallen in and frozen to death.

Architect Colin Machin, who was 50, was found dead at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, last week, but police do not believe there is aÂ  criminal reason for his death.

Instead they are hoping that a post-mortem - expected to be carried out this week - will shed some light on whether Mr Machin froze to death or died of other causes.

A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'We have got to keep an open mind about everything now.'

Tributes have been paid to father-of-two Colin Machin, right, who was found dead in a freezer at the home he shared with his wife Maria, to his left. Also in the picture are their daughters Sinead, left, and Erin, right

Mr Machin was found at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, last week

Dundee University Graduate Mr Machin, who ran architecture firms Machin, Dunn and Macfarlane and Machin Associates, and ran Boll Holiday Cottages with his wife, Maria, 51, was a popular figure locally.

Friends and family have now paid tribute to the architect, who leaves daughters Sinead, 23, and Erin, 21, online.

Mr Machin's younger daughter Erin changed her profile picture on Facebook to a photo of her and her father, and posted lyrics from the song Caledonia, saying: 'Let me tell you that I love you. And I think about you all the time.'

Friend Kevin Hogg wrote: 'Such a great guy with a huge heart. Such a privilege having being a friend, so sad to have have lost a great friend.'

Margaret Paterson added: 'There are not enough words to say how sad Jock and I are to hear about Colin.

'A wonderful person and loyal friend whom I will miss very much. My love to you all.'

Police are treating the death as 'unexplained'. It is understood officers are working on a theory that no crime was involved in his death

Another friend wrote: 'I did not want to believe what I was hearing, just heartbroken for you all.

'Colin will be so missed by everyone who knew him.'

Pauline Fisher told Erin: 'So so sorry to hear about your dad. He was a great friend and so much fun to be around. We will miss him. All our love to you.'
