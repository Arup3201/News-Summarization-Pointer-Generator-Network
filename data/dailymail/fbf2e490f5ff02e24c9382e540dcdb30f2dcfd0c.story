She’s an aristocrat in name only. But a little technicality like that wasn’t going to stop Dame Edna Everage mixing with some very blue-blooded friends last night.

Dame Edna was more than happy to pull up a seat next to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during the annual Royal Variety Performance.

The couple burst out laughing in delight as Dame Edna joined them in the Royal Box at the London Palladium.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also met legendary West End composer Andrew Lloyd Webber at the London Palladium

They were seen joking with Dame Edna,
played by 79-year-old Australian comedian Barry Humphries, who wore his
trademark mauve wig and rhinestone glasses. 

Camilla
wore a specially-commissioned midnight blue evening gown by Vivienne 
Westwood. Her floor-length midnight blue silk gown had scoop-neck detail
with textured fabric.

She 
teamed the frock with a matching purple silk shrug, matching silk court 
shoes in the same shade of blue and accessorised with a statement silver
necklace.

The couple met legendary West End composer Andrew Lloyd Webber at the London Palladium, as well as singer and The Voice judge Jessie J.

Liverpool comic John Bishop hosted the evening which incorporates the best of British music, dance and comedy.

Take That frontman Gary Barlow, the cast of the hit West End musical Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Olly Murs, Dame Edna Everage and jazz musician Carol Emerald are on this year's bill.

Figure skaters Torvill and Dean will mark the 30th anniversary of their Olympic gold medal by taking part in the show and newly-discovered dance act Attraction won themselves a place on stage after coming first in TV reality show Britain's Got Talent.

U.S. singer Mary J Blige, cockney singers Chas & Dave and the cast from the upcoming spoof X Factor musical are also on the line-up.

The evening also included a performance from choirmaster Gareth Malone’s latest project, Voices.

Malone
is hoping to repeat his 2011 success and gain another Christmas number 
one, this time with their rendition of A Little Respect by Erasure.

Bishop, 46, said: 'As a child, the Royal
Variety Show was like the Grand National and the FA Cup final - it was 
something our family always watched (the only difference being that we 
didn't bet on the winner).

'To host a show with such heritage is something I never imagined I would do and I trust my parents will be proud when they take their seats in the audience, although I have told my dad not to shout, 'Come on son' ... It's not a match or a horse race!'

The last time the Prince and Duchess attended the Royal Variety in 2010 their evening was marred when a protester campaigning against the rise in tuition fees attacked their Rolls-Royce limousine.

David Walliams hosted last year's 100th anniversary show in front of the Queen at London's Royal Albert Hall.

This year's performance, staged in aid of the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund, will be screened on ITV in December.
