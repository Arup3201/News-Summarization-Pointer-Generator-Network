Paris Couture Fashion Week came and went in a blur of whimsical designs with incredible showings from the likes of Zahair Murad, Valentino, Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel.

Berlin Fashion Week, however, hasn't been quite such a spectacular showcase.

A far cry from the £20,000 gowns on show in the French capital, one German designer even appeared to take inspiration from an aardvark, sending models down the catwalk in gas masks resembling the peculiar animal.

What is THAT? Irene Luft sent models down the runway in some seriously weird headwear at Berlin Fashion Week yesterday

This appearance is Irene Luft's fifth time at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin and this season her creations were wackier than ever.

As the daughter of a master tailor she followed her mother’s footsteps and attended the renowned German Master Craftsmen School for Fashion.

She founded her own eponymous label in Munich and has since established herself as one of fashion's biggest names.

All white! This is Irene's fifth appearance at the prestigious Fashion Week and she has become a big name on the fashion scene

Barely there: Some models donned gas masks made out of, what looked like, scraps of napkins in revealing dresses

Berlin Fashion Week lacks the glamour of its Parisian counterpart but it does showcase up-and-coming as well as established designers in all their glory.

Berlin does lie at the heart of a massive fashion, culture, and trend setting revolution and boasts  designers like Aquilo Rimondi and many more setting the style stakes for the new season, with the likes of Mischa Barton and Stella McCartney in attendance.
