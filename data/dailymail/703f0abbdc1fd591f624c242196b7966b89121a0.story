Israel has been accused of spying on White House nuclear talks with Iran and then leaking details to Republicans in Congress in an effort to scupper the deal. 

President Obama's administration, along with Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain, have been engaged in highly confidential talks with Iran. 

However, Israel's security services have been accused of relaying information gleaned from the talks to Republicans in Congress.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nethanyahu flew to the United States earlier this month to lobby President Barack Obama, right, about Tel Aviv's concerns over any potential deal with Iran over their nuclear ambitions

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, pictured, said at the weekend  there was 'nothing that can't be resolved' 

Leading Republican senator Linsdey Graham, pictured, warned President Obama against signing a deal without first bringing the proposal to Congress to allow proper scrutiny of any agreement 

Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took time out from his re-election campaign to directly lobby U.S. President Barack Obama and senior members of Congress to highlight Israel's opposition to any proposed deal. 

Upon his return to Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu said: 'After my short visit to the United States, I return to Israel knowing that many around the world heard what Israel has to say about the impending deal with Iran.'

Mr Nethanyahu wanted any proposed deal dependent upon Iran denouncing terrorism world wide and ceasing its ongoing sponsorship of jihadi organisations.  

The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. intelligence agencies discovered Israeli officials discussing information that could have only been gathered from inside the confidential talks. 

A senior U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal: 'It is one thing for the U.S. and Israel to spy on each other. It is another thing for Israel to steal U.S. secrets and play them back to U.S. legislators to undermine U.S. diplomacy

A White House source said: 'People feel personally sold out. That’s where the Israelis really better be careful because a lot of these people will not only be around for this administration but possibly the next one as well.' 

A spokesman for Mr Netenyahu rejected the espionage claims. 'These allegations are utterly false. The state of Israel does not conduct espionage against the United States or Israel’s other allies. The false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the United States and Israel and the security and intelligence relationship we share.'

This denial was reiterated by the country's outgoing Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman: 'This report is not true. Obviously Israel has security interests to defend and we have our own intelligence. But we do not spy on the United States. There are enough participants in these negotiations, including Iranians. 

'We got our intelligence from other sources, not from the United States. The instruction has been clear for decades now: you don’t spy on the United States, directly or indirectly.'

The Israeli government has strongly denied spying on the talks which are being held in Switzerland 

However, reaction in Congress among Republicans to possible deal with Iran has been hostile, with one senior senator warning that the White House faces 'a violent backlash' if it bypasses Washington and instead brings the deal to the United Nations. 

The negotiations concern a promise to loosen economic sanctions on Tehran if the Iranian administration pledges to cease development of nuclear weapons. 

Republican senator Lindsey Graham threatened to pass legislation in the Senate in April to require congressional oversight of any deal before it can be brought to the U.N. 

The deal is being discussed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and if agreement is reached, it is expected that it will receive the full backing of the United Nations. 

Senator Graham told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York: 'That would be met with a violent response in the Congress. I don't think that's good for the country - to take a deal that could affect world order to an international body before you take it to your own people.'

Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the bipartisan bill to give Congress a vote on any agreement reached. 

The bill would require the president to submit the text of any agreement to Congress and would prohibit the administration from waiving any of the congressional sanctions for 60 days. During that time, lawmakers could hold hearings and approve, disagree or take no action on the deal.

Israel wants any deal to include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear weapon development programme

Senator Corker, who introduced the measure with Democratic Senators Bob Menendez and Tim Kaine of Virginia and Graham, already wrote to Mr Obama warning him not to try to by-pass Congress. 

In a letter, Senator Corker told President Obama that letting the U.N. consider such an agreement - while at the same time threatening to veto legislation that would allow Congress to vote on it - would be a 'direct affront' to the American people and would undermine the role of Congress.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that substantial progress had been made on a possible deal, claiming 'there is nothing that cannot be resolved'. 

The talks are taking place in Lausanne, Switzerland, and are expected to resume tomorrow after a two-day break. 

Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz has flown to Paris to directly lobby the French over the deal. 

He said that dialogue with France in the past over Iran's nuclear ambitions have proven 'productive' in the past. 

He said: 'We don't have a plan B, we only have a plan A and this is to try to prevent a bad deal with Iran or at least to try to make it more reasonable and to close some of the gaps and loopholes that made it even worse.'

Israeli diplomats believe that the United States is willing to do a deal with Iran. Israeli officials claim they are only interested d in proposal which 'dismantles, not simply freezes' Tehran's nuclear weapon programme. 

Former Israeli ambassador to Germany Shimon Stein added: 'It's only natural that given Netanyahu's concern of a deal with Iran that he would turn to France. France is the weak link among the group.'
