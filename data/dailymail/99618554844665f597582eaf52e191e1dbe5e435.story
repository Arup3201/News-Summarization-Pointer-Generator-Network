War medals will be given a special exemption from inheritance tax under proposals buried in yesterday’s Autumn Statement.

Until now awards for military service counted towards a person’s wealth when they die.

But George Osborne yesterday scrapped the unpopular tax on military awards.

War medals - including these Korea War medals - will be given a special exemption from inheritance tax under proposals buried in yesterday’s Autumn Statement

There was already an exemption for medals and other decorations awarded for ‘valour or gallantry’.

The medals included the Victoria Cross, George Cross and Military Cross – but also awarded for gallantry overseas included the famous Legion d’Honneur and Croix de Guerre in France.

The Turkish ‘Order of Medjidieh’ was also exempt.

But from today ‘all decorations and medals awarded to the armed services or emergency services personnel’ will be exempt.

OBEs and CBEs will also be exempt, the Treasury confirmed today.

Death taxes of 40p in the £1 are paid on inherited wealth of anything more than £325,000.

The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to £1million before the 2010 election – but have failed to increase it since 2009.

But Mr Osborne yesterday moved to exempt emergency workers, and humanitarian aid workers from future inheritance tax bills if they are killed in active service.

Armed forces personnel who die in the line of duty are already exempt.

George Osborne was at a Bentley factory in Crewe this morning after yesterday's Autumn Statement 

The change covers anyone working for the police, fire, ambulance or the search and rescue services, and follows a government consultation launch in the summer.

He has also extended it to all humanitarian aid workers aimed at those who have gone to west Africa to help fight the spread of Ebola.

Inheritance tax currently hits around 16,000 families a year.

But official forecasts have suggested the number of families paying inheritance tax will double over the next five years because of soaring house prices.
