A BBC reporter slipped up today by referring to Baroness Thatcher's funeral as a 'wedding'.

Charlie Stayt was talking to DJ Terry Wogan when he made the blunder, which was widely ridiculed by viewers on social media.

ITV also came under fire for refusing to broadcast the momentous ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral.

While the BBC and Sky News each set aside hours of programming dedicated to the service, ITV decided to continue with its normal morning shows.

Blunder: Charlie Stayt, left, called Baroness Thatcher's funeral a 'wedding' while talking to Terry Wogan

Confused: Terry Wogan did not know what to make of the blunder during his interview

Mockery: Web users took to Twitter to make fun of the embarrassing gaffe on live television this morning

Mr Stayt was standing outside St Paul's when he 
interviewed Mr Wogan, saying: 'It's interesting, it's an eclectic mix of
 people who are invited to the wedding... yourself - to the funeral, my 
apologies.'

The veteran DJ chuckled at the mistake, but viewers were quick to leap on the error and took to Twitter to mock the BBC.

'Gaffometer soars - Charlie Stayt BBC
 St Paul's just asked Wogan about being invited to attend "the 
wedding"... aaaahhh,' journalist Colin Brown wrote.

Claire McLoughlin added: 'Charlie Stayt just accidentally called Thatcher funeral a wedding. Giggle!'

Ceremony: The funeral of Baroness Thatcher was broadcast live on BBC and Sky News today

Interview: ITV decided not to broadcast the funeral in favour of This Morning, featuring Chris Evans

On ITV, Daybreak, Lorraine and 
This Morning all featured interviews with commentators and friends of 
Lady Thatcher, and cut away to the scene at St Paul's every so often.

However,
 from 9.30 to 10.30, ITV was broadcasting The Jeremy Kyle Show, the 
controversial talkshow dedicated to sordid family dramas which often 
features fistfights in the studio.

Should every major TV station have been broadcasting Baroness Thatcher's funeral or were ITV right not to?

As the BBC showed David Dimbleby 
interviewing Conservative grandees and political veterans, and Sky News 
showed scenes from inside the cathedral, ITV broadcast a shouting match 
between two girls and a man who was trying to deny that he was their 
father.

And while grandees filed into St Paul's and Lady Thatcher's coffin was driven to the cathedral, a young woman told the studio audience that she was trying to work out who her real father was.

Matthew Woolcott wrote on Twitter: 'Live coverage on BBC of Thatcher funeral. On ITV... Jeremy Kyle. Yes, really.'

This Morning was hosted as usual by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby - neither known for their political acumen.

The last time Mr Schofield attempted a high-profile political occasion, he caused controversy by handing David Cameron a list of alleged paedophiles which he had collected from the internet.

Disrespect? The Jeremy Kyle Show, a notoriously sordid chat show, was broadcast in the run-up to the funeral

Contrast: At the same time Jeremy Kyle was on, David Dimbleby was interviewing friends of Lady Thatcher on the BBC One coverage

As the coffin was taken into the cathedral, This Morning ran a feature on dangerous criminals - apparently ignoring the start of the funeral.

They also interviewed the victim of an arson attack in a Leicester gay bar from October 2011.

Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans then joined Mr Schofield and Ms Willoughby on the show, discussing his own career.

The pair also interviewed a writer who said that seeing his wife give birth gave him post-traumatic stress order, and interrogated him on his love life.

Viewers criticised the decision to cover the funeral from the This Morning sofa, claiming that it trivialised the moment of national mourning.

Paul Hempstead tweeted: 'Liking the respectful coverage of thatcher on ITV. Now over to the sofa to discuss it with 2 random women and Harry Hill #thismorning'.

Chris Voss wrote: 'Did ITV miss out on the rights to Thatcher's funeral?'

The BBC did not escape criticism for its coverage of Lady Thatcher's funeral - although the choice of the experienced Mr Dimbleby as anchor was widely praised.

'BBC is covering Thatcher's funeral properly with a Dimbleby at the microphone,' Twitter user Rob Clarke wrote. 'Much better than that Queen's Jubilee c**p.'

Ahead of the service, the Corporation seemed keen to interview anyone it could - including Mr Wogan, who admitted his connection to the former Prime Minister was 'tenuous'.

Andrew Pelling wrote on Twitter: 'Terry Wogan's commentary uncomfortably inappropriate for a BBC coverage of Margaret Thatcher's funeral that should be respectful today.'

Mr Stayt, the presenter of BBC Breakfast, also came under fire for not wearing a black tie - unlike Adam Boulton, who was anchoring the Sky News coverage at the same time.

Some web users also accused the BBC of being overly negative, focusing more on the possibility of unrest than the respectful mood felt by most bystanders.

'The BBC must be disappointed only finding two Anti-thatcher supporters on the streets of London this morning,' Stephen Woods tweeted.

Jacqui Burke added: 'BBC reporters at Thatcher funeral sound so disappointed that they can't get anyone to say anything negative.'

Others pointed out that the free-market stateswoman was not fan of the state-funded broadcaster.

Robert Wilkin wrote: 'Watch the funeral on the BBC? You must be joking. Margaret Thatcher despised the BBC!'
