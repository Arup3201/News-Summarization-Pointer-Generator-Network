The government has written off England's World Cup chances even before the team has boarded the plane to Brazil.

David Cameron’s plans to relax drinking laws during games have been based on the assumption that Roy Hodsgon’s side will not progress far beyond the group stages.

The Home Office has decided there is a ‘high probability’ that England will not make it into the knock out games, so the impact of extended pub opening hours will be limited.

THe boss: Roy Hodgson has named his 23 man squad for the World Cup in Brazil

The damning assessment emerged just as Hodgson unveiled his 23-man squad which he hopes will take him to World Cup glory.

Mr Cameron overruled the Home Office to insist that pubs should be allowed to open when the Three Lions were in action this summer.

But the details of the plan reveal how Whitehall is pessimistic about England’s chances in Brazil.

The official impact assessment on late-night drinking says there is a ‘high probability’ the squad will not play in ‘later matches’.

Just yesterday Hodgson confirmed he will be taking a side packed with young talent as England bid for their first world title since 1966.

The squad includes young midfielders Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere in the 23-man squad.

But Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick was left out, less than two years after he was tempted out of international retirement by the England manager.

Ashley Cole and Jermain Defoe - with 162 caps between them - were the other most senior internationals jettisoned.

Fans flocking to pubs to watch England play could boost the industry by £20million, the British Beer and Pub Association has claimed.

But while they will be hoping for victory, Whitehall was rather more pessmistics  when drawing up rules on extending licensing for matches kicking off throughout the night due to time-zone differences.

The impact assessment said: ‘While England are certain to be playing in the matches in the first period, there is a high probability that they will not be playing in the later matches.’

The gloomy predictions are based on bookies odds, officials said.

‘We have used odds from Betfair.com13 implying that England have a 54% probability of progressing past the group stage and an 11 per cent probability of progressing past the quarter-finals, allowing us to estimate the expected benefits.’

Labour's Lord Rosser highlighted the comments, saying: ‘So it's good to know what the Government thinks of England's prospects.'

Home Office minister Lord Taylor of Holbeach said the comments in the paper were 'a matter of opinion'.

He added: 'I'm sure other peers will have different views on that issue.’

A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘Because we want everyone to get behind the England football team this summer, the Government has extended licensing hours so fans can watch England games in pubs.

‘As part of the process for changing licensing hours, the Government is obliged to carry out a formal impact assessment.

‘As part of that assessment, officials used odds from Betfair to estimate the probability of England playing in the knock-out stages.

'The Government is of course 100% behind the England football team and we wish the players every success in the World Cup.’
