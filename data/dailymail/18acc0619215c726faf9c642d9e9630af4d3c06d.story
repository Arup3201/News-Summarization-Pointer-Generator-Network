Actor Bill Roache has been pictured hugging members of a spiritual love sect just hours after leaving his first day at court.

Here he can be seen hugging members of Circle of Love, a group which meets twice a month to practise spiritual healing, meditate and discuss the mysteries of the universe.

The Coronation Street star, 81, spent two hours with the group at a community centre near Altrincham, Greater Manchester, following the first day of his trail for child sex offences last week.

According to the Sunday Mirror, Roache arrived at the meeting with his daughter, Verity, and after parking ran through the rain to the main entrance where other members were waiting for him.

Early last year Roache split from his girlfriend, 44-year-old weathergirl Emma Jesson, so that he could be free to 'explore a mystic message of love' after revealing he had joined the group.

The motto of the Circle of Love is to share 'wisdom, knowledge, but above all, love' and meetings involve meditation, reiki - a form of healing using mystic vibrations - and discussions where members share messages from the spirit realm.

The main message of the group is that love conquers all. They seek to 'empower each person to recognise their own knowing, their own truth' and welcome people from any religion.

Roache is currently standing trial at Preston Crown Court accused of indecently assaulting five girls more than 40 years ago, exploiting his fame in the knowledge they wouldn’t dare to speak out.

On the most recent day of the trail, a woman who claims she was groped by Bill Roache as a schoolgirl said that she was warned away from him by another Coronation Street star.

In a video interview played to the court the woman - who was around 14 at the time - recalled how Roache allegedly behaved ‘like an octopus’ with ‘hands everywhere’ as he indecently assaulted her in a dressing room.

She then explained a chance encounter while sitting on the steps outside Granada Studios in Manchester, in which she was warned to 'watch that one' by Johnny Briggs, who played Mike Baldwin in the series.

Roache, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies five counts of indecent assault and two of rape involving the girls then aged 16 or under.
