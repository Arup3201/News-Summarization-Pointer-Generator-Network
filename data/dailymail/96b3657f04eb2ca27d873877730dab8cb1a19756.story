The American doctor diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia says he will have no regrets if he cannot be saved, a friend revealed today.

Kent Smith,
 an elder at the South Central Alliance Churches in Fort Worth, Texas, 
where Kent Brantly and his wife Amber worship, told MailOnline that the doctor has been frank
 with friends.

'God's going to deliver me from this 
but even if he doesn't I have lived my life for him and I have no 
regrets,' he has said, Mr Smith told MailOnline.

Dr Brantly, a 33-year-old father of two, is one of two Americans fighting for their lives. Married 
missionary Nancy Writebol, from Charlotte, North Carolina, is also fighting for her life at a Liberian hospital as the continent struggles 
against the worst ever outbreak in history.

Hopeful: A sign at Southside Church of Christ in Fort Worth, Texas offers support for Dr Brantly. There is only a 10 per cent survival rate for people who become infected with the incurable disease

Nearly 700 people have been killed by Ebola in West Africa, with 127 of those in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization, but the families of the Americans hope prayers will pull them through.

Brave: Dr Brantly has said that he is putting his trust in God to help him defeat the Ebola virus

Speaking 
from her home in Indianapolis, Indiana, Dr Brantly's mother Jan, 72, said she was in
 'daily contact' with her son's wife, Amber, and that she was praying 
for them both.

She
 said: 'It's a very very stressful time. Kent is a fine young man, very 
compassionate, doing what he’s prepared all his life to do.

'He’s placed his life in the hands of a loving God and our love in that God sustains us.

'We pray constantly for him and we solicit the prayer of the whole world. He's a brave man. He's doing what he's doing to serve his God and we are asking people to pray.'

Outside of Brantley's church, a sign reads: 'Pray for Kent.'

Infected: Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, also became infected while working in Liberia

Brantly, who has been working
 as medical director for an Ebola case management center run by 
Samaritan's Purse, recognized that he had symptoms associated with Ebola
 last week, Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for the North 
Carolina-based charity, told the Dallas Morning News.

The virus can go unnoticed for three weeks and 
kills 90 per cent of those infected. Health workers are at serious risk 
of contracting the disease, which spreads through contact with bodily 
fluids.

There
 is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever 
and sore throat and escalates to vomiting, diarrhea and internal and 
external bleeding.

Brantly,
 who had meticulously adhered to protocols when treating patients, 
immediately isolated himself when he recognized the symptoms and 
notified team members, Strickland said.

He is now 
being treated in an isolation center at a Liberian hospital and is in 
stable condition. He is sitting up and working on his computer, 
Strickland said.

Cautious: Dr Brantly of Samaritan's 
Purse relief organization is shown wearing protective clothing as he 
works with Ebola patients in Liberia. Brantly is also being treated 
after somehow becoming infected with the virus

'His fever 
is fluctuating,' she said. 'He has some aches and pains... He's a very 
dedicated person and a very strong person, and he’s fighting as we'd 
expect someone like him to fight.'

His
 family, who had moved to Liberia with him, had returned to the U.S. for
 a pre-planned trip last week, before he found out about his condition. 
They have shown no signs of the disease.

MailOnline understands that his wife is not at their home in Fort Worth, Texas, but is elsewhere and staying with family.

Before
 heading to Liberia, Brantly, who graduated medical school in Indiana in
 2009, had worked as a resident at John Peter Smith Hospital, and he 
completed his three year placement last year.

Throughout
 the residency, he and his wife managed to save money and pay off his 
student debts so that they could head to Africa to become international 
medical missionaries last October.

They went to Liberia 
as part of a two-year fellowship with Samaritan's Purse.

'The
 caliber of a person like that who says, "I'm going Africa, I'm going to
 where people need me the most," it really speaks to you,' Robert 
Earley, president and CEO of JPS Health Network, said Sunday, NBC reported. 'It speaks
 to your heart.'

Safe: Dr Brantly's wife and children went on a trip back to the U.S. before he started showing symptoms

Missed: Brantly and Writebol, right, are both in isolation, which is devastating for their families, friends said

Aparna
 Raj Parikh, who had attended medical school with him, told the Dallas 
News that he wasn't surprised that Brantly had put himself in danger to 
help others.

Photos of Brantly working in Liberia show
 him in white coveralls made of a synthetic material that he wore for 
hours a day while treating Ebola patients.

Writebol
 had moved to Liberia with her husband. She worked as a hygienist, 
spraying protective suits worn by health care workers treating Ebola 
patients in Monrovia, the Charlotte Observer reported.

Writebol 
and her husband David are not medical personnel, but rather Christian 
missionaries with 15 years experience serving disease and 
poverty-stricken third world nations.

Originally
 from Charlotte, North Carolina, the couple raised two sons before 
moving overseas, first to Ecuador and Zambia before moving to Liberia.

'It's
 just devastating news,' her pastor, Reverend John Munro, said. He 
described the couple as religious, humble people who were desperate to 
stay and help despite the congregation's fears.

Caution: Sierra Leone now has the highest number of Ebola cases, at 454. The outbreak started in Guinea

Her husband, David, delivered the terrible news to the congregation over Skype, he said.

'He's 
devastated,' Munro said. 'He can't really be with his wife. She’s in 
isolation. Ebola is very contagious. She's not doing well. It's grim 
news.'

The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks.

Dr. Samuel 
Brisbane on Sunday became the first Liberian doctor to die in an 
outbreak the World Health Organization says. A Ugandan doctor working in
 the country died earlier this month.

Brisbane,
 who once served as a medical adviser to former Liberian President 
Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine 
unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F. Kennedy Memorial 
Medical Center in Monrovia.

After
 falling ill with Ebola, he was taken to a treatment center on the 
outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an 
assistant health minister.

The current outbreak of Ebola has spread to at least four countries in West Africa since the start of the year. So far, it has claimed 672 victims, and infected 1,093. Countries affected include Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.

The disease spreads through contact with blood, body fluids or contact with tissue from infected people or animals. It has only a 10 per cent survival rate.

Civil
 servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20
 after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his 
sister, who had also succumbed to the disease.

His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country.

Professor
 Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University 
of Aberdeen, said: ‘If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be 
cause for concern.

‘Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.’

Nigeria,
 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers – but
 doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation 
period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot.

Symptoms
 include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is
 no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or 
other bodily fluids.

All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280.

Unprecedented: The outbreak has spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and has now killed a man in far more densely populated Nigeria. The outbreak is the deadliest ever of the terrifying disease as the death toll crept past 700

As
 the death toll continues to rise in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, a
 fourth African country was alerted over the weekend to their own case 
of Ebola: the far more densely populated nation of Nigeria.

Nigerian
 health authorities raced to stop the spread of Ebola on Saturday after a
 man sick with one of the world's deadliest diseases brought it by plane
 to Lagos, Africa's largest city with 21 million people.

The
 fact that the traveler from Liberia could board an international flight
 also raised new fears that other passengers could take the disease 
beyond Africa due to weak inspection of passengers and the fact Ebola's 
symptoms are similar to other diseases.

Nigerian
 officials say a Liberian man died of Ebola in a Lagos hospital Friday 
after arriving in the country on Tuesday. It is the first case of Ebola 
to be confirmed in Nigeria since the current outbreak began in West 
Africa earlier this year.

Nigerian
 Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said all ports of entry in the country
 are now on 'red alert' and health officials are investigating all 
people who had contact with the deceased.
