Proposals: The European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso outlined the plans for lower international phone charges during his 'State of the Union' speech

Landline calls anywhere in Europe will cost the same as ringing family or friends at home, while mobile phone calls will be capped at 16p a minute, it has been revealed.

Companies will also be barred from charging more for international calls within the EU under plans which could lead to a dramatic reduction in one of the biggest household bills.

The proposals outlined by the European Commission would 'abolish premiums' within the 28 member states, meaning dialing relatives abroad would cost the same as a long-distance, domestic call.

The plans are the latest move by Brussels in a long-running battle with telecoms companies over 'rip off' fees which can lead to costs almost double those in the UK

Vodafone charges customers up to £1 a minute to call European countries on its standard price plans while the international rate for BT is 23.2p a minute for calls to landlines in France or Germany.

The proposals were dubbed the 'most ambitious plan in 26 years of telecoms market reform' by Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in a state of the union speech, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The continent's biggest mobile providers, who charge customers millions to use their handsets abroad, could now fight the proposals over the fees.

The new laws are designed to create a 
single market for telecoms services in Europe and block what Brussels 
officials referred to as 'arbitrary profits'.

Reaction: BT have said they will look at the proposals and 'determine their impacts'

The European Commission also wants to 
make it far easier for customers in member states to be able to switch 
provider and walk away from a contract if it is not met by what is 
stated in adverts.

Neelie Kroes, vice president 
and the digital agenda commissioner responsible for the plan, said: 'The legislation proposed today is great news for the future 
of mobile and internet in Europe.

Cheaper: The plans would see a huge reduction in phone costs which are one of the largest household bills

'The European Commission says no to roaming premiums, yes to neutrality, yes to investment, yes to new jobs.'

Ryah Heath, spokesman for the digital agenda package said they were taking a carrot and stick approach to the plans.

He said: 'The carrot is for the phone companies to offer an EU-wide phone plan which works everywhere.

'We will exempt them, but if they don't do that, consumers will be able to choose a different company when they travel abroad if they are not happy with the prices their company are offering.'

A spokesman for BT said the company would look at the plans and wait for the proposals to be finalised in the Euoprean Parliament and Council.

But, they said their views will be made known to EC, Ofcom and The Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

Anne Bouverot, Director General of GSMA, which represents mobile phone operators, said: 'The Commission has rightly identified that increased investment in Europe’s telecoms infrastructure is needed to drive progress across all sectors of the economy but, on balance, the package needs to do much more to support this goal.' 

'A more thorough and comprehensive approach is required and the mobile industry stands ready to contribute to efforts to develop an ambitious shared agenda to underpin Europe’s digital economy.

'Reform today will set the context for investment and innovation in Europe’s digital economy for the next ten years.

'It is essential that we get it right and this process should include a comprehensive review of the increasingly outdated regulatory framework for telecoms in Europe.

'The right policies are ones that encourage investment, enable innovation and help build consumer confidence.

'We will continue to support efforts to develop these to help drive Europe towards a connected future that meets the expectations of its businesses and consumers.'
