A convicted murderer tried to skip his sentencing hearing because he didn't want to hear his victim's family 'b**** and whine' about what a monster he is, it has emerged.

Seth Mazzaglia, who was convicted in June of the 2012 killing of University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth Marriott, dropped his bid to skip the hearing after an appearance in court on Tuesday.

Prosecutor Peter Hinckley had argued that Mazzaglia, 31, should be compelled to attend the sentencing hearing, which will be held on Thursday.

'Suffice it to say there are multiple 
interests at stake - the court's, the public's, the victim's family and 
the defendant's,' Hinckley told Strafford County Superior Court Judge 
Steven Horan.

Killer: Seth Mazzaglia, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, said he didn't want to listen to the victim's family 'yell and whine' about what a monster he is at his sentencing hearing - but he has now dropped his bid to skip it

On Tuesday, the court heard how Mazzaglia had told his mother in a recorded phone call that he did not want to go and 'have to sit there for an 
hour and a half listening to them yell and whine and b**** and moan 
about what a monster I am' - referring to Marriott's family and friends.

'I already know what everyone's gonna say there so why the hell do I have to be there,' he said in the call, made on August 6. 'And it's a waste of my time.'

He insisted that he should have been found 'innocent of the big stuff'.

But his mother, Heather Mazzaglia, told her son that he should face the family.

'They're in misery,' she said. 'I mean they're in agony - their daughter is lost. I would be the same if it were you... You have to sympathize with what they've lost.

'I think you have to be there... I think they have a right to confront you because the jury found you guilty.'

Victim: Lizzi Marriott was killed after she rebuffed Mazzaglia's advances in 2012 and her body has never been found. Her mother Melissa, pictursed, called Mazzaglia 'cowardly' for trying to avoid the sentencing hearing

After court on Tuesday, the mother of victim 
Lizzi Marriott, Melissa Marriott, said she wasn't surprised by 
Mazzaglia's comments to his mother.

'He's just a selfish coward, and he really does not care about anybody else,' she said.

She called his motion 'a 
self-serving attempt to avoid being held publicly accountable for 
Lizzi's murder and rape' and said it was 'a cowardly attempt to avoid 
facing us, the victims of his horrific crimes'.

Mazzaglia was convicted in June of 
first-degree murder and other felonies in the October 2012 death of the 19-year-old student, who was from Westborough, Massachusetts.

His ex-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, testified he 
strangled Marriott from behind with a rope and then raped her motionless
 body at his Dover apartment after he rebuffed her advances.

Testimony: Kathryn McDonough, Mazzaglia's girlfriend at the time of the killing, is pictured in court in June as she testified that she had brought the teen to their home as a sex offering for her boyfriend

McDonough had lured Marriott to their 
apartment as appeasement to him and to join their sexual escapades, 
which included bondage and discipline.

McDonough first told investigators that Marriott died during rough sex between the two women that involved restraints. After getting immunity from prosecution, McDonough said Mazzaglia strangled Marriott and then raped her.

Marriott's body, which prosecutors say was dumped in a river, has never been found.

McDonough pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution and is spending 1 1/2 to 3 years in prison.

On August 6, Mazzaglia spoke to his mother, Heather Mazzaglia, on the phone from prison and told her he did not want to go to the trial. A transcript of the recorded call was shared in court on Tuesday:

Heather Mazzaglia: Have the lawyers come to visit you at all?Seth Mazzaglia: Um, rarely because it's a bit of a haul for them but they're supposed to come visit me before the fourteenth [the date of the sentencing hearing]. I'm gonna see.HM: Okay.SM: If there's any way I cannot attend the fourteenth.HM: Either what?SM: That I cannot go to the fourteenth. I already know what everyone's gonna say there so why the hell do I have to be there. And it's a waste of my time.HM: Yeah well it's - it's for them.SM: Yeah well I'm not feeling particularly gracious at the moment.HM: I know.SM: Heh. If I had been found innocent of the big stuff like I should have been, and like I am, now then it might be a different story. Then, then I might have some sympathy.HM: Well.SM: But.HM: Yeah all you can do is regret your part in it. And.SM: Yeah but I'm gonna have to sit there for an hour and a half listening to them yell and whine and b**** and moan and scream about how I'm a monster who killed someone when I'm not. That's what I'm literally gonna have to listen to for the whole time.HM: (Unintelligible)SM: It isn't gonna be like, "Oh you took away our chance of burying her", it's gonna be, "You're a monster" and that's what it's gonna be over and over and over again.SM: Ah.HM: So anyway. Anyway. I'm - I mean you can -, they're in misery. I mean they're in agony. Their daughter is lost. I would be the same if it were you but, you know, you have to sympathize with what they've lost and I, ask, um, ask Jacque and Melissa I mean and the verdict took long I don't see why you, eh, it's you're allowed to say that. I don't know. I don't know what they allow you to do.SM: Well my preference would be not to attend the sentencing hearing on the fourteenth. I can get an after action report that tells me everything that I already knows gonna happen there.HM: I think you have to be there to be sentences so. I think they have a right to confront you because the jury found you guilty.
