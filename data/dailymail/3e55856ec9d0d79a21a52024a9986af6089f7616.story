Labour MP Maria Eagle was 'ballistic' over motion Scotland should be allowed to vary 24-week upper limit as part of devolving powers to Edinburgh

Ed Miliband has been caught up in a furious Labour row over plans to let Scotland decide its own abortion laws.

The proposal is outlined in the cross-party Smith Commission report on devolving powers to Edinburgh drawn up in the wake of the ‘No’ vote in September’s referendum on Scottish independence.

But the suggestion that Scotland should be allowed to vary the current 24-week ‘upper limit’ for terminating pregnancies sparked a blazing row at last week’s Shadow Cabinet meeting.

Senior frontbencher Maria Eagle, who has opposed a reduction in the abortion time limit, led calls for the proposals to be thrown out. Witnesses said the Shadow Environment Secretary banged the table and hit out at the male-dominated Commission who were drawing up the plans.

She said: ‘This is outrageous. What we’ve got is a bunch of men deciding on women’s rights to abortion.’

Pro-abortion activists fear that Scotland, with its strong Roman Catholic tradition, could insist on its abortion regime being tightened if given the chance.

They fear this in turn could lead to Scottish women travelling to England for terminations.

A Labour source said there was ‘panic’ at the behind-closed-doors Shadow Cabinet meeting when they were told the Smith Commission was poised to recommend handing over the abortion powers. 

One said: ‘Several people went ballistic – it wasn’t just Maria.’ The source said that Ms Eagle, MP for Garston and Halewood in Merseyside, was only placated when she was promised that the final Commission report would be ‘watered down’.

The report – agreed after the meeting – still called for ‘serious consideration’ of the plan.

But a Labour insider said: ‘This has effectively been kicked into the long grass.’

Last week’s row came against the backdrop of Ed Miliband’s party finding itself under huge pressure from a rampant SNP and amid dire predictions that Labour could to lose as many as 37 of its 41 Scottish seats at Westminster in next May’s Election.
