This is the incredible moment a water bomber was used to pour thousands of litres of water on a burning lorry.

The plane was called in because the local fire chief feared it would take too long for a fire truck to arrive at the scene in a remote part of Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.

The lorry erupted in flames after it crashed into a road grader on the treacherous Trans-Labrador Highway.

Flames: Smoke billows out of the lorry as the water bomber approaches the scene

The 47-second video shows the plane straightening out as it rapidly approaches the fire scene on a gravel road that is blocked by authorities.

With just a few feet to spare the plane drops a massive amount of water on the smouldering wreckage. The lorry and grader are not visible through the wall of water.

The Labrador fire service had been dealing with widespread forest fires all summer and decided not to take any chances, so it requested aid from above.

There was a lack of available water to put out the fire and because of the isolated rural location the authorities were anxious that a fire truck would not be able to prevent the flames from spreading to the dry grass and trees. 

The lorry driver was trapped inside the burning vehicle but the driver of the road grader managed to pull him to safety.

Timing: The pilot releases the water at just the right time as he flies directly over the fire

No risks: Labrador firefighters had been battling widespread forest fires and did not want to risk another one

Close call: The driver of the lorry has to be pulled to safety by the driver of the road grater

The amazing footage was recorded last year but it has recently emerged online once again.

Shawn Noseworthy, a manager with Humber Valley Paving, was part of a work crew on site when the crash occurred.

Mr Noseworthy filmed the remarkable water bombing on his mobile phone.
