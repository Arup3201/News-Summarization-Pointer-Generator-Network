Hopes of an end to the Ukrainian conflict look bleak after the release of a deeply disturbing video purportedly showing two hostages being 'executed' on the orders of a pro-Russian separatist leader.

Some sources claim the macabre footage is staged but 'meant to provoke terror' while others fear it is authentic.

A man resembling Igor Bezler, a Russian separatist leader, in the mining town of Horlivka, twinned with Barnsley, is seen in a darkened cellar ordering the shooting of two blindfolded pro-Ukrainian men, and threatening others if Kiev fails to release its separatist captives.

'Execution': A man, believed to be a Russian separatist leader, was filmed ordering the deaths of two men

Threats: The man says that he will continue to kill two men an hour until Ukrainian authorities release their captives

'If my man is not released soon, every hour we will shoot two officers,' threatened the mustachioed man believed to be Bezler in a video aimed at the Ukrainian authorities.

He claimed to be holding three SBU secret services colonels and three lieutenant-colonels held as hostage.

'At the moment all agreement with Ukrainian side are broken. I have been waiting for three days but I do not have more time to wait.

'Mr Budyk and Mr Vasyuschenko will be shot dead now.... if my man is not free in one hour, second two will be shot, in another hour and a half, the third two. Until all eight officers are shot dead. If the Ukrainian army and state does not need these officers, I do not need them either.'

Slumped: A gunshot can be heard in the video, after which the two blindfolded men fall to the ground. It has been suggested that the video could be staged

The then gives the order to a marksman armed with a Kalashnikov to shoot and two men - their backs to the gunmen and camera - are seen collapsing on the floor to the sound of gunfire. 

A pro-Ukrainian activist called Vasyl Budyk was abducted in Horlivka on 2 May. 

Alexander Khryakov, a leader of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, is on record as claiming the video is authentic, though several sources have expressed doubts. 

The Ukrainians allege that Bezler is a serving office in Russian military intelligence. 

Following the video's release acting president Oleksandr Turchynov warned: 'The Russian citizen Igor "Bes" Bezler is a criminal and murderer, that is why he should be punished under the Ukrainian and international law.

'He will not manage to escape this punishment.'

He also stressed that the authorities 'were not holding negotiations with murderers and terrorists'.

Topic of conversation: Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two men spoke of 'the soonest end to bloodshed in south-eastern Ukraine and combat actions by both parties' - separatists and Kiev's armed forces

The responsibility for the 'crimes committed by Russian citizen Bezler also lies on the political leadership of Russia that continues to supply arms and support bloody terror in the east of Ukraine', he said.

While there have been claims of 'executions' by the armed forces of self-proclaimed independent states in eastern Ukraine, it has been impossible to verify the reports. 

The footage emerged before today's brief encounter between president-elect Petro Poroshenko and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in France.

Putin later called for a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, and told Poroshenko to show 'good will' over the conflict.

Both men vowed to seek an end to bloodshed. 

Poroshenko is due to be inaugurated in Kiev on Saturday at a ceremony to which Putin has not been invited.

Loading up: Soldiers pile shells into their tank in anticipation of more fighting. Ukrainian authorities say 200 people have died over the past few weeks
