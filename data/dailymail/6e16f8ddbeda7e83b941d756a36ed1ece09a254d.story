THE Duchess of Cambridge was definitely overdue when she went into labour yesterday, according to Kensington Palace sources.

It is thought she may have been 41 weeks pregnant — a week overdue – but comfortably within the normal margin for giving birth.

In fact, fewer than one in 20 women give birth on their due date.

Around half go into labour up to two weeks after this point, the expected date of delivery given at the start of the pregnancy.

Some mothers have their labour medically induced during this period because of concerns about their health and that of the baby. Professor Andrew Shennan, an internationally renowned specialist in obstetrics, says it is more accurate to talk about a ‘due month’ of birth because each woman’s circumstances are different.

The professor, who is based at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, said his unit’s policy is not to intervene until a woman is two weeks overdue, unless there is cause for concern.

Professor Shennan explained: ‘Most women want to give birth naturally when possible and if there is no reason to induce, we’d rather not because it involves using drugs. Only about 4 per cent of women deliver on their due date, so it’s better to talk about a due month, because when they are giving birth naturally around half will deliver later.’

The placenta, the baby’s support system in the womb, is equipped to last for between 40 and 42 weeks.

If labour does not start during this 
period there is a risk of the baby running out of nutrients — when it 
has never been bigger  or needier.

Another reason for intervening earlier
is when there are signs of pre-eclampsia, which can threaten the lives 
of mother and baby.

When a decision is taken to induce 
labour, a variety of drugs can be used to soften up the cervix and start
contractions. Like thousands of other first-time mothers, Kate would 
have been asked to keep track of her contractions at home.

She would have had instructions to 
contact her medical team when they were strong and regular, coming at 
the rate of two or three every ten minutes, or if she was worried.

Professor Shennan, a leading 
researcher for the baby charity Tommy’s, said: ‘It’s OK to stay at home 
at this stage and there is some evidence that women do better as a 
result.

‘When they increase to three or four 
every ten minutes then normal labour has started and she will need to 
set off for the hospital, allowing for the time of day and traffic.’

Professor Andrew Shennan says it is more accurate to talk about a 'due month' of birth as each woman's circumstances are different. Kate Middleton is currently in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital (pictured)
