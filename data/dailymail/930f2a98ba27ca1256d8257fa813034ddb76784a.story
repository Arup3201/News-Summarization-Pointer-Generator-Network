For a bullock with two heads, he's mighty healthy.

A cattle saleyard in Mareeba, North Queensland, hosted an unusual sight on Tuesday when a livestock agent arrived to hawk a two-faced cow.

Its second face, mounted on top of its first, had one eye, a single tooth and functional nostrils, according to the saleyard. It was in 'great condition'.

'Mate, he's as fat as a fool!' said Elders selling agent Mark Peters, who witnessed the animal's purchase yesterday.

Two faces! This unnamed two-face bullock was successfully sold at Mareeba Saleyards by Queensland Rural selling agent Jack Shepherd on Tuesday

According to the saleyard staff, the second face (attached on top of the first face above) had one eye, one tooth, working nostrils and was in 'great condition'

Mr Peters said: 'It was an absolute prime condition animal, he just had two faces'. 

Unsurprisingly, the two-faced animal attracted curious glances at the saleyards. 

'It received a fair amount of attention,' said Queensland Rural livestock agent Jack 'Jacko' Shephard, who sold the bullock. 

Mr Shephard said he had not seen another two-faced cow during his 17 years on the job, although he had seen other abnormalities. 

The 440kg animal successfully sold for $537AUD, or 122 cents per kilo.

But the future is not bright for this cow.

He was purchased by an abattoir.  

'It was an absolute prime condition animal, he just had two faces,' said Elders Mareeba livestock agent Mark Peters, who witnessed the two-faced bullock's sale
