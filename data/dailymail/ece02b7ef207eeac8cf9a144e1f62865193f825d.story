Former Manchester United winger Chris Eagles has opened talks over a move to Blackpool.

The 28-year-old has been a free agent since leaving Bolton Wanderers in the summer and has turned down an offer from Championship rivals Millwall.

Eagles has held talks with a number of clubs and is now training with Lee Clark’s side alongside former Celtic defender Darren O’Dea.

Lee Clark is looking to bolster his depleted squad with his team currently bottom of the Championship

Blackpool have been battling to bolster their squad all season and coach Jose Riga was sacked in October with the club bottom of the Championship table, having won just once.

Eagles left Manchester United in 2008, spending three years at Burnley before moving to the Clarets’ fierce rivals, Bolton.
