With just two days to go before the Women's Rugby World Cup finals, England centre Claire Allan admits she's raring to go.

Allan, who plays centre and full-back for Richmond and England, missed the last tournament after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament just two weeks before it began.

She said: 'This is a really proud moment for me.  
After missing the tournament in 2010 I can’t wait to get on the pitch 
and see it also as a way of thanking my family, friends and the support 
staff for all their help.'

Physical: Allan said England know little about opponents Samoa or Canada except they will be physical

Preparing for a World Cup is hectic at the best of times, but especially for Allan who has to balance training with her career as a police officer. But the 29-year-old admitted she has enjoyed the punishing schedule.

'Training has stepped up with a lot of contact sessions,' she said, 'which some players have liked more than others.  It has been great as we have been lucky to spend a lot of time with each other, so you can feel a rise in intensity from our Six Nations campaigns.'

England have been drawn against Spain, Canada and Samoa in their group, and despite not knowing a great deal about their opponents, Allan was sure England will be prepared for whatever comes at them.

Press-ups: Claire Allan says there has been a noticeable increase in intensity between now and the Six Nations

She said: 'We don’t know too much about Samoa and Canada but they will be tough, physical teams.  We have played Spain a lot on the 7’s circuit and they have some really skilful, quick players. 

'We are however just focusing on ourselves and what we need to do, taking each game at a time.  There is a really good atmosphere in the squad and we are all really close.  A lot of us have been playing with each other since we were 16.'

The Women’s Rugby World Cup is live on Sky Sports from August 1.
