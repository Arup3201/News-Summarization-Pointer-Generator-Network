In Hollywood's golden age, photographers
 were often hired to come on set and take reams of still images of actors during 
filming, for promotional purposes.

The resulting contact sheets - tiny images printed on to sheets so photographers could scan them and pick the best - were regarded as mere byproducts and would often be covered in scribbles and notes.

Now, however, they are
treasured by film buffs, for whom Hollywood Frame By Frame: Cinema’s 
Unseen Contact Sheets will provide consuming reading.

The new book brings together rare, unpublished images from some of the most famous films from the 1950s-1980s - and of some of the world's most glamorous stars - and offers a tantalising glimpse of what happened just before or after filming.

The new book brings together rare, unpublished images from some of the most famous films from the 1950s-1980s

The new book features collected contact sheets from classic movies such as Rear Window (1954), Some Like it Hot (1959), Taxi Driver (1976), 
Scarface (1983) and more.

Capturing
 legends such as Audrey Hepburn, Alfred Hitchcock, Marilyn Monroe, Robert De NIro and 
Frank Sinatra at the height of their powers, these images offer rare glimpses into the science of movie marketing, and the 
nature of stardom.

One such contact sheet sees Marilyn 
Monroe with her handsome co-star Don Murray as the pair enjoy the Jaycee World Championship Rodeo in Phoenix. They were on
 location at Arizona State Fairgrounds to film the rodeo scenes for 
Joshua Logan's Bus Stop in March 1956.

Audrey Hepburn is also seen blinking through smoke after her famous scene from 
Breakfast At Tiffany’s, and Robert De Niro taking a punch for his art in Raging Bull.

It's
 remarkable to see the moments of spontaneity, the slipping of the 
facade, often visible in the outtakes right alongside the images deemed 
commercially useful.

Captioned with fresh insights from the creatives involved, each contact sheet tells its own story about the film, the stars, and the off-screen chemistry that yields the on-screen movie magic.
