A woman who lost her birth certificate aged 12 has finally been given a passport after 14 years in legal limbo - but only after undergoing DNA tests to prove that she is British.

Allem Kerr, 26, was left unable to work, apply for a driving licence or holiday abroad with officials unable to give her a passport because there was no official record of her birth.

Her Scottish parents MS sufferer Ann, 56, and her full time carer husband Andrew, 60, have struggled to support their daughter over the years while she desperately tried to register her existence.

She attempted to contact the South African hospital where she was born only to find it had closed down and even wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron asking for help.

Relieved: Allem Kerr, 26, is planning a holiday after receiving a British passport after 14 years in legal limbo

But a DNA test has now finally proven to the Court of Session in Edinburgh that Miss Kerr is her Scottish mother's daughter and eligible for a UK passport.

She said: 'It's been a nightmare of red tape but I'm so relieved that I officially exist.

'I'm British. I happen to have been born in South Africa but I have lived in Scotland almost my entire life, but proving it has been a real problem.'

Allem, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, was repeatedly told by Home Office officials and the consulate of South Africa that there was no record of her birth and attempts to contact the hospital where she was born proved futile as she discovered it had closed and records been moved or lost.

She even wrote to Downing Street desperate to resolve her plight, but to no avail. She said: 'I wrote to David Cameron and his secretary replied that she would pass it on to the Home Office, but that was months ago and I've heard nothing.

'We even tried to contact the hospital where I was born and the doctor who delivered me but it is not there anymore.'

UK citizen: Allem was only able to prove to the courts that she is eligible for a British passport by undergoing a DNA test

Allem was born in South Africa after her Scottish parents decided to emigrate, but the family returned to Britain when she was four.

Her brother Alasdair, 28, and sister Mallory, 24, both have their birth certificates but Allem lost hers when the family moved to a new house when she was 12.

Since then she and her parents have tried in vain to track down the vital piece of paper.

Her last foreign holiday was on a school trip 11 years ago when she went on a group passport.

Allem won her lengthy identity battle after contacting lawyers who applied for a declaration of parentage at the Court of Session.

DNA tests were ordered and she has finally received her passport - and now she is planning her first holiday for over a decade.

She said: 'I would love to go to Greece, and France - in fact there are so many places to go. I feel I have a lot of catching up to do.

'I'm also saving up for a car and I have finally been able to send away for my provisional driving licence.'
