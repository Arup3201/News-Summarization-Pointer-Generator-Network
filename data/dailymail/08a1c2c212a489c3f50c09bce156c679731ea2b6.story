The BBC spent £70,000 of licence-payers' money on an annual party for local radio staff despite plans to axe 400 jobs, it has been claimed. 

Costs for the Corporation's annual Gillard Awards included a £35 Venison dinner for more than 200 people and free travel to and from a hotel, a source said. 

The hotel costs alone for last year's event topped £25,000, with thousands more spent on alcohol and transport, it was alleged.

The BBC spent £70,000 on an events ceremony for local radio staff last year, it was claimed, as the Corporation announced plans to axe 400 jobs to save money  

A BBC spokesman this morning rubbished the claims, insisting the total costs for the event were in fact £34,115.15 - just shy of £200 per head.  

A spokesman could not offer a breakdown of the above figure when asked by MailOnline this morning. 

The Gillard Awards party, which celebrates local radio, was held months before bosses revealed more than 400 jobs would be axed in a bid to save millions. 

An estimated 415 jobs are to be scrapped to save £48 million a year by 2016/17 with James Harding, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, described the cuts as ' an extremely difficult undertaking.' 

'The challenge is how to make BBC News even better, despite having less money,' he told a London meeting. 

James Harding, Director of News and Current Affairs said cutting hundreds of jobs was an 'extremely difficult undertaking' 

Among costs for last year's Gillard Awards was £896 by BBC Tees spent on rail fares, it was claimed. 

The alleged £25,000 hotel costs were revealed in a Freedom of Information Request, according to the Sun. 

'Factor in a conservative estimate of £100 shift cover and £50 transport plus alcohol and hotels and the total exceeds £70,000,' a BBC source told the newspaper. 

A BBC spokesman this morning denied the figure as 'ludicrous', insisting the total cost of the party was around £34,000. 

This year's event  he said, cost around £13,000 but not all expenses - including travel, shift cover and hotel stays - had been accounted for yet.

The party, at Guildhall in Hull, saw broadcasters and producers sit at large, round tables strewn with wine buckets and candelabras.

Guests were put up in the nearby Holiday Inn Express, where rooms start at £69.00, according to the hotel's website. 

Last year, the party was held in Windsor. 

A spokesman today praised the awards, saying: 'BBC local radio has been connecting local communities for years.  

The Gillard Awards honour this by helping ensure quality output and highlight the excellent programmes people listen to across the country.' 

But critics warned taxpayers may question the need for expensive events when funds are strained.  

Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance said, 'It is crucial that the BBC watches the cost of these taxpayer-funded celebrations, particularly at a time when the Corporation's having to find necessary savings, resulting in pay freezes and job cuts within the organisation.' 

In 2011 the Corporation was slammed for spending £70,000 on leaving parties and award ceremonies over 12 months. 

Figures revealed £20,000 was spent on London parties and £48,000 on alcohol. 

The Corporation ran up a bill of £581 at Paradise, a gastro-pub in Notting Hill, west London at an event for just 17 people.

It also spent £600 at both the Clarendon, in Holland Park and the Iskele, a Turkish restaurant in Clerkenwell.

A further £595 was spent at the Stinging Nettle in Shepherd's Bush and the cocktail bar in LVPO in Soho, according to figures released under freedom of information laws.

At the time a spokesman said the BBC was 'dramatically' cutting back on expenses.
