A pensioner was punched and battered by a gang of hooded thugs after he confronted them for throwing snowballs at his elderly wife. 

Brian Cox, 74, had put up with the youths hurling snowballs at his windows for three days.

But when his 70-year-old wife Joy was pelted outside their home in Northampton last Thursday, Mr Cox decided enough was enough and courageously stood up to the gang.

Swollen: Brian Cox suffered from severe bruising after he was punched and kicked by a gang outside his home

But shockingly the yobs retaliated by headbutting the retired caretaker to the ground before punching him in the face and mouth.

He managed to escape and stumbled the short distance back to his house with blood pouring from his mouth, where his shocked wife dialled 999.

Mr Cox said: 'I've worked hard all of my life, but I thought I am not going to sit here and be intimidated.

'About 15 of them came round and they were banging snowballs against the window.

'My wife went out to see what was happening and they threw snowballs at her.

'She is 70-years-old and she has had a heart attack before. It could have scared her to death.'

The
couple, who have three children, 12 grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren, say they are now too scared to leave their home 
after the attack. 

Mr Cox said: 'I'm 75-years-old this year, I'm not 21 anymore. I went down when one of them headbutted me.

'It is still swollen and I had lots 
of blood in my mouth afterwards. I haven't been able to eat properly 
since and I'm taking painkillers every day. 

'I did national service in 12 months in Yemen when I was younger and I never saw yobs like this over there.'

The great-grandfather was taken to hospital where he was treated for severe bruising to his face.

Two teenagers - aged 17 and 14 - were arrested shortly afterwards but released without charge while investigations continue. 

Mr Cox's wife Joy, also a retired school caretaker, added: 'It beggars belief that these young lads could do this. 

'It was terrifying when they were throwing the snowballs. They make such a noise and I'm surprised the windows didn't smash. 

'We haven't been able to sleep properly since.

'We're scared to leave our home now.

'These kids have been running riot and nobody has done anything about it.

'And God knows what their parents think they are up to.'

A Northamptonshire Police spokesman confirmed officers attended the scene at 8.45pm. 

Witnesses to the incident should call the police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
