Iain Duncan Smith last night called on Ed Miliband to ‘immediately’ say what cuts Labour would make to keep within a legal cap on welfare set by the Government.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Labour leader’s decision to back the new long-term limit was a ‘scam’ unless he was prepared to say how he would fund the scrapping of the so-called bedroom tax.

A group of 13 Labour MPs, including former frontbenchers Diane Abbott and Tom Watson, rebelled against their party’s backing for the Government’s plan.

But the measure, which means overall welfare spending cannot rise above inflation from a fixed limit of £119.5billion until 2020, passed easily in the Commons, by 520 votes to 22.

A radical new limit – to be set every five years, and taking effect next year – will include housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits, although the state pension and jobseekers’ allowance will be excluded.

Governments will have to respond to any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what Chancellor George Osborne describes as a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’.

Under the legislation, any increase on one part of the welfare budget will have to be offset with cuts elsewhere. A Commons vote will have to be held if the cap is breached and the Government does not want to respond by cutting spending.

Pledge: Labour has already pledged to reverse cuts in housing benefit for council tenants with spare rooms - dubbed the 'bedroom tax' by critics

An incoming Labour government will be free to set a higher cap at the start of the next parliament, but would have to change the law if it wanted to unpick the system altogether.

Labour has already pledged to reverse cuts in housing benefit for council tenants with spare rooms - dubbed the ‘bedroom tax’ by critics. Mr Duncan Smith said reversing the housing benefit cuts would mean Labour would immediately breach the cap as it would cost £460million.

‘They have to say immediately now what would they actually reduce in that spending to be able to afford that otherwise they are voting to break the cap immediately,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said.

‘I think there’s a bit of a scam going on. Because what they are trying to persuade their own backbenchers is, “Don’t worry, we won’t implement this as it stands”.

‘They have to tell us whether they would make savings to cover getting rid of the spare room subsidy.’

Ed Miliband suffered a fresh blow yesterday when a poll showed that fewer than a fifth of voters think he is fit to be prime minister. A YouGov survey said that just 19 per cent could imagine him in Downing Street and only 26 per cent of voters think Labour is ready for government.
