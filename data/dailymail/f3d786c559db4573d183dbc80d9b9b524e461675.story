A shocked woman claims to have found a mouse foot in a Lidl mince pie - after tucking into the festive treat.

Kathie O'Connor made the grisly find in a £1.49 box of the supermarket's Luxury Mince Pies that she bought in Harpurhey, Manchester.

The 58-year-old said she was down to her last bite of the first pie out of the box when she felt the  inch-long object in her mouth.

'It's about an inch long, gristly and ghastly, ' she said.

'The more I think about it the sicker I feel because I don't know what it is. To me it looks like a mouse's foot.

'I was down to the last bite of my pie when I felt something hard in my mouth and then I pulled that out.

'It was my first mince pie of the year and it will be my last one.'

After finding the bone-like object in the first pie of the box Ms O'Connor complained to Lidl.

She has been told to send the pies, packaging and the mysterious item back to the store so they can work out what it is. 

 'That has really put me off, I might try a mince pie next Christmas but that is it for me this year,' she said.

'I can't get it out of my head that it's a mouse's foot. Even if it's not, I want to know what it is because this isn't a complaint about a missing button, this is my food. 

'It's a good job I am an adult, a child might have choked.'

A Lidl spokesman said: 'We can confirm we have been in contact with a customer regarding the contents of a Lidl mince pie.

'A member of our customer services team spoke with the customer and requested images in order to investigate the matter fully.

'Lidl also contacted the customer via email to request that the product in question be sent to us for testing.

'We will, of course, keep the customer updated with the findings of our investigation and we appreciate their patience and understanding through this process.'

The 58-year-old has been asked to send the rest of the box of mince pies, the packaging, and the bone-like object back to Lidl
