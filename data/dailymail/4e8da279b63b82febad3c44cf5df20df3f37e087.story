The question of who may be buried in an enormous and mysterious tomb in northern Greece has titillated archaeologists for months.

But now, at a well-known burial just 100 miles (161km) away from the Amphipolis site, experts have confirmed that a grave unearthed decades ago, belongs to Alexander the Great’s father.

A team of researchers have confirmed that bones found in a two-chambered royal tomb at Vergina, belong to Macedonian King Philip II.

Experts have confirmed that a grave unearthed decades ago, does belong to Alexander the Great’s father, as experts have previously guessed. A team of researchers have confirmed that bones found in a two-chambered royal tomb at Vergina, belong to Macedonian King Philip II (shown on this coin)

A total of 350 bones and fragments found in two caskets in the tomb were examined, Discovery reported. 

Researchers found trauma on some of the bones, which helped them decide they belonged to the ancient  king of Macedon.

They also found bones belonging to a female warrior, thought to be the daughter of the Skythian King Athea.

A collection of photographs, X-rays and other evidence is expected to be released on Friday at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, to settle the debate about the tomb’s occupants once and for all.

The two-chambered royal tomb at Vergina (marked on the map) lies in the north of Greece, some 100 miles away from Amphipolis (also marked), which is the site of a mysterious ancient tomb. Archaeologists are working hard to establish who it belongs to

The bones were first recovered in 1977 by Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos when he was excavating the mound, known as the Great Tumulus.

Debate over whether the tomb really belonged to Philip II has raged ever since.

Three tombs were found in the mound. The first, known as Tomb I, had been looted, but a wall painting of the Rape of Persephone remained, along with bones.

Tomb II was found untouched and Mr Andronikos found the cremated remains of a male skeleton in the main chamber, along with the cremated remains of a woman in the antechamber.

Philip II was king of the Greek kingdom of Macedon from 359 BC until his assassination in 336 BC.

He was the father of Alexander the Great and Philip III.

He is reported to have come up with the maxim 'divide and conquer'.

The warrior king gained control of Greece and other lands along the Balkan peninsular using a mixture of warfare, diplomacy and marriage alliances.

He laid the foundations for his son's impressive military feats, who went on to conquer many more lands stretching east from Greece and Egypt to India.

It has been popularly claimed for decades that the tomb in Vergina belongs to Philip II, but now the new research has settled the debate.

Analysis of the king's cremated remains reveal that he sustained many injuries in battle, including a laceration to his hand and rode a horse frequently.

Gold wreaths, silver and bronze vessels, weapons, amour and gold caskets, hinted that the tomb belonged to a member of a royal family. 

Experts were unsure, whether the remains in Tomb II were Philip II and one of his wives, or Philip III Arrhidaeus, who was Alexander the Great’s half-brother.

Phillip III took the throne after Alexander's death and the female could have been his wife, Eurydice.

To come to their conclusion, the researchers, led by Theodore Antikas, scoured the bones for peculiarities that might give them clues.

They found that the man suffered from  frontal and maxillary sinusitis - inflammation of the lining of the sinuses - which was probably caused by an injury to the face.

This could have been the result of an arrow that hit Phillip II in the right eye and blinded him at the siege of Methone in 354 BC.

Experts found others signs of wear and tear consistent with a warrior, such as trauma to the ribs and a wound on his left hand, which was likely caused by a weapon.

Lesions also led them to conclude that the bones are of a middle-aged man who rode a horse.

The female remains also helped to shed light on the remains of Philip II.The female was between 30 and 34 when she died, meaning that she could not be Arrhidaeus’, wife, who was under 25.

By studying the bones, anthropologists discovered that the woman was also a keen rider, was cremated soon after her death and had a slightly shorter left leg.

All eyes are on a mysterious tomb (pictured) some 100 miles from Vergina, where archaeologists seem close to revealing another secret of the ancient royal family.

‘This leads to the conclusion that the pair of mismatched greaves [shin armour] - the left is shorter - the Scynthian gorytus and weaponry found in the antechamber belonged to her,’ Mr Antikas said.

The researchers believe that the remains and armour belong to an unknown daughter of the Scythian king Ateas, who was defeated by Philip in 339 BC.

‘No Macedonian King other than Philip is known to have had "relations" with a Scythian,’ Antikas said.

His team picked through over 100 never-studied bone fragments from Tomb I to find that it was where seven people were laid to rest – a man, woman, child, four babies and a foetus.

The find disproves previous theories that the looted chamber contained the remains of Phillip II and his family.

The largest antique tomb ever found in Greece was unearthed in August in Amphipolis, not far from the newly confirmed tomb belonging to King Philip II.

Since then, archaeologists have debated who it may belong to, with candidates including Alexander the Great, his mother Olympias, his wife Roxana or an important general.

Now an intricate mosaic has been uncovered in the tomb, which lies around 100 miles (161km) from Vergina and Philip II's confirmed grave.

The mosaic measures 15 feet (4.5 metres) by 10 feet (3 metres) and covers the whole floor of a room, which is thought to be the ante chamber to the main burial room at Amphipolis.

It shows a chariot drawn by two white horses, driven by a bearded man wearing a crown of laurel leaves. Hermes - the messenger of the gods in ancient Greece - stands in front of the chariot, according to experts from the Greek Culture Ministry.

A number of scholars believe that the presence of female figures, known as caryatids, show that the tomb belongs to a female.

Experts have previously suggested that the tomb belongs to one of the king’s officials.

A broken marble door and large sculptures such as caryatids made marble that support an inner entrance into the tomb, have been found.

A pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's main entrance beneath a large arch, a painted lintel and other frescoes have also been discovered.

It was feared that the tomb was completely looted, but the discovery of the treasures has given experts hope that they may finally find remains and solve the mystery of the unknown tomb.

The find in Amphipolis in northern Macedonia adds weight to archaeologists’ suspicions that the burial mound could hold the remains of a family member of Alexander the Great - perhaps his mother
