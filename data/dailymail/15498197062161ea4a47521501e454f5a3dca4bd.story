Republican Alan Grayson has sent out an email for his re-election campaign in which he says people are sick of the Tea Party's tactics

A Democrat Congressman has compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan in an attack on right wing politics as part of a fund-raising campaign.

Republican Alan Grayson has sent out an email for his re-election campaign in which he says people are sick of the Tea Party's tactics.

'At this point, the Tea Party is no more popular than the Klan,' he says, a catchphrase that was used by his campaign group to tag a link to his comment on Twitter and elsewhere online.

Grayson, who represents Florida’s Ninth Congressional District that includes Orlando, Kissimmee and St. Cloud, shared his transcribed interview with talk-show host and Democrat Rev. Al Sharpton, on last week's MSNBC’s 'PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton'.

At the top of the email he attached a picture of KKK members watching a burning cross at night, with the words Tea Party written in flames. The flaming cross represents the 'T'.

When asked if he think the President has the Tea Party 'on the ropes', Grayson replied: 'I think so. I think that ordinary Americans are with the President. They’re appalled by the Tea Party’s tactics. They come to the President saying, “If you don’t let us steal your car, then, we are going to burn down your house.”

'They are appalled by the way the Tea Party cheered on the shutting down of the government, cheered at the fact that we put our credit at risk for a generation to come.

'And they’re appalled by the enormous expense - the fact that this temporary shutdown ended up costing America $24 billion. That’s almost $100 for every man, woman, and child in this country.

'Frankly, they want their money back, and the Tea Party out of their lives. At this point, the Tea Party is no more popular than the Klan.'

The Congressman's campaign group also shared his comments on Twitter.

He goes on to say he thinks the Tea Party is on its way out.

'The Republican Party is going to go the way of the Whig Party, the way the Whig Party disappeared in the 1830s in America. And the reason is simple. They simply won’t do anything useful for ordinary people.

'Whether the issue is jobs or housing or health care or transportation, whatever the issue might be, they got nothing.'

In the wake of the debt ceiling controversy which saw the US government stalled by lack of consensus over its budget, Grayson has also said he thinks House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, 'has to go'.

He said the Republican catered to the Tea Party and therefore ignored the interests of US citizens.

According to ABC News, it is not the first time Grayson, 55, has made controversial public remarks.

In 2009, he called a senior Federal Reserve advisor a 'K Street Whore'. He also said of the Republican GOP healthcare proposal: If you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.'
