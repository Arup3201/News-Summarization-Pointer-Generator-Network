India is stepping up its tourist provision by introducing dedicated carriages for visitors on trains.

The government's Ministry of Tourism announced that the new plans that will take effect on routes that travel through or terminate at the country's more popular attractions.

Research will be carried out prior to passengers setting foot on the tourist carriages, so that specific information can be passed out that can help guide the tourists.

Tourists may escape the India rush on trains with their own dedicated carriage to travel in

Speaking to the Hindu Business Line, Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Tourism said: 'We will have complete information of any passenger who books a ticket for this coach. The ticket for this may be 5-10 per cent costlier than the regular coach fare. 

'We are also looking at the possibility of a surveillance camera in the tourist coach.'

Sharma has indicated that as the prices will be slightly higher for the tourist carriages compared to the rest of the train, the facilities will be of a higher standard.

Attractions such as the Taj Mahal but be continually cleaned to provide the ultimate tourist experience

'What we are planning is end-to-end tourism encompassing cleanliness, safety and security and high level of hospitality for tourists,' he added.

The tourist train carriages are just part of a wider programme to improve the India experience, led by the BJP Centre-led government.

The idea of specific tourist train carriages follows several high profile cases of travellers being attacked in the country.

In January this year, two men were accused of gang raping a 51-year-old Danish tourist in New Delhi who stopped them to ask for directions.

Violence against women in India has caused increasing alarm since the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old Indian physiotherapy student in New Delhi in December 2012. Several foreign tourists also have been targeted in attacks that often get international attention, although Indian women are assaulted far more frequently.

The Indian government wants to improve the tourist experience for foreign visitors

Tourism figures fell significantly in the three months following the 2012 gang rape, with visits by women dropping 35 percent, according to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Although the industry appears to have bounced back,negative publicity still swirls following attacks on foreign women.

Plans to spruce up monuments and heritage sites are also important to help boost tourism to India, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Mr Modi also urged the separate state governments that it is their responsibility to provide a hassle-free prgramme for tourists.

Speaking to NDTV Sharma said: 'If we receive a person at the airport, work out their itinerary, take them around in India and finally drop them off at the airport with the assurance that they are looked after by the government as guests, concerns about touts and harassment would disappear.'

The full announcement on India's re-think on tourism is expected to be announced on Christmas Day.
