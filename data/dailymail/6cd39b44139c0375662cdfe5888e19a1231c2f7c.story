The toughest group in the African Cup of Nations begins on Monday and Algeria, a surprise package at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, take on South Africa in Equatorial Guinea.

Algeria, 18th in the FIFA world rankings, are the highest placed team in the tournament and one of the early favourites to win the competition.

But South Africa know that beating them would send out a huge statement to Senegal and Ghana, who also compete against each other in Group C's other fixture.

Here, Sportsmail's Adam Shergold profiles the two teams ahead of the showdown.
