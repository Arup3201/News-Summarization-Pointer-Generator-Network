England won their first World Cup warm-up with relative ease at Wembley with Daniel Sturridge, Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka on the scoresheet.

But who performed and who should be looking over their shoulder? SAMI MOKBEL gives his ratings.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Roy Hodgson

Main man: Daniel Sturridge led the line brilliantly and capped his performance with an excellent goal

Joe Hart: Looks well past those early season wobbles that threatened his World Cup place - 6.5 Definite starter 

Glen Johnson: Always a willing runner down the right, but must be more disciplined defensively in Brazil - 6 Definite starter 

Gary Cahill: England's best central-defender. Largely untroubled and scored with an excellent header - 6.5 Definite starter

Composed: Gary Cahill was untroubled and made sure of victory by scoring the second goal

Phil Jagielka: Looks comfortable at this level now. Knows, if he's fit, he plays and benefitting as a result - 6.5 Definite starter 

Leighton Baines: Safe pair of hands down the left and delivery from wide will be an asset. Two assists - 7 Definite starter 

Steven Gerrard: Assumed his club 'quarterback' role and was yet again England's heartbeat. Booked - 6.5 Definite starter 

Jordan Henderson: Showed great energy in midfield, but still question marks about his quality on the ball - 6.5 In contention

Willing: Jordan Henderson showed great energy but there are question marks over his ability

Adam Lallana: Showed in flashes why he's being touted as a starter for the opener against Italy - 6.5 In contention 

Wayne Rooney: Being positioned just behind Sturridge suits his game, but he must maintain his goal threat - 6.5 Definite starter 

Danny Welbeck: Looked dangerous at times, but the Manchester United man doesn't do enough when in possession - 6 On the bench

Daniel Sturridge: Led the line and marked the occasion with a brilliant opener. Has the potential to be England's main man - 7.5 Definite starter

On the bench: Danny Welbeck looked dangerous at times but should not start against Italy

Jack Wilshere (for Gerrard 64): Got 25 much needed minutes under his belt and will be better for it - 6 In contention 

Raheem Sterling (for Rooney 66): Tipped to be England's wild card in Brazil. Added urgency into England's attack - 6.5 In contention 

James Milner (for Lallana 73): What you see is what you get. Will be important in games against top opposition - 6 In contention

Wild card: Raheem Sterling but be England's secret weapon in Brazil

Chris Smalling (for Jagielka 73): In the squad for his versatility. Slotted in comfortably at centre-back - 6 On the bench 

John Stones (for Baines 76): Big night for the youngster on his England debut. One for the future - 6 On the bench 

Ross Barkley (for Sturridge, 83): Has the ability to break teams down with a flash of brilliance. A weapon as a sub - 5 On the bench 

Subs not used: Lampard, Foster, Lambert, Barkley, Forster, Flanagan 

Bigger challenges lay ahead but he'll be happy with the result, if not completely by the performance - 7

Steady: Roy Hodgson will be happy with the result if not entirely by the performance

Fernandez 5; Advincula 6 (Velarde 78), Ramos 6 (Riojas 68), Rodriguez 6, Callens 6; Ballon 6, Cruzado 6, Yotun 6.5; Deza 5 (Ruidiaz 65, 5), Carrillo 6 (Flores, 87); Ramirez 6 (Hurtado, 60, 5) Subs: Gambetta, Forsyth, Trauco, Gallese  

Pablo Bengoechea - His side certainly didn't come to make up the numbers. Provided England with a decent test - 6.5 

Viktor Kassai (HUN): Didn't endear himself to the home supporters by booking captain Steven Gerrard for a meaty first half tackle - 6
