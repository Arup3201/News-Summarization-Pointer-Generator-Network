Chris Ling is one of a number of teachers being investigated over allegations of abuse at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester

A violin teacher accused of sexually abusing pupils at one of the country’s top music schools could be ordered back to Britain.

Chris Ling is one of a number of teachers being investigated over allegations of abuse at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester.

Children have told how Ling would instruct girls as young as 15 to strip naked during lessons or spank their bare bottoms when he was a young teacher at Chetham’s in the 1980s.

Ling, now 55, moved to California after a previous police inquiry in 1991 resulted in no action.

Yesterday detectives at Greater Manchester Police said they had been speaking to US authorities with a view to extraditing him.

More than 30 female former pupils have reported historic sexual abuse at Chetham’s and the Royal Northern College of Music – also in Manchester – since the conviction in February of former Chetham’s director of music Michael Brewer for sexually assaulting a pupil more than 30 years ago.

His victim, mother-of-four Frances Andrade, committed suicide during the trial at the  age of 48 following a torrid cross-examination.

The publicity surrounding the trial and her suicide has led to other ex-pupils coming forward.

Former pupils have named a number of ex-teachers in connection with the alleged abuse, of whom five have subsequently died – including renowned Chopin specialist Professor Ryszard Bakst.

Mr Ling is married to former pupil Pippa Clarke, who is now a concert violinist.

Ling has repeatedly declined to comment on the claims.

But contemporaries have described how his pupils were known as ‘Ling’s strings’ and that he bragged about taking nude pictures of them.

A police spokesman said: ‘We are supporting each and every person who has come forward and made a complaint to us as best we can.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
