The Duchess of Cornwall has lent her support to a pioneering prisoner rehabilitation scheme after meeting convicts at HMP Erlestoke in Wiltshire this morning.

Camilla, who has visited the Category C jail before, took tea with prisoners during the visit and met prison staff and supporters. 

She also witnessed the world of Friends of Erlestoke Prison, a charity of which she is patron and which helps rehabilitate offenders.

Camilla also stopped to praise volunteers working with the men, saying: 'I always say this country would collapse without volunteers. You are the backbone of this country.'

Speaking about a new scheme which sees helpers drive visitors to and from the prison to the station, she added: 'I imagine it must make a big difference to their lives because otherwise how would they get there?'

The Duchess, who has long been a supporter of the charity, also got a glimpse of other programmes, including literacy training and mentoring schemes. 

During the  tour, Camilla met prisoners in the library and watched offenders learning vocational skills such as bricklaying and plastering in the prison's workshop.

The royal who was elegant in a knee-length grey pin-striped suit and simple pearl earrings, praised the establishment's initiatives.

It comes two years after she first visited the prison in 2012, when she attended the Pimlico Opera's production of 'Les Miserables' which was performed by the company alongside serving prisoners.

The Duchess then became patron of the Friends of Erlestoke Prison in 2013, which also helps ex-offenders find employment and accommodation, and bring fathers closer to their partners and children.

In total, HMP Earlstoke houses 500 inmates, some of whom are serving short sentences while others are sentenced to life.
