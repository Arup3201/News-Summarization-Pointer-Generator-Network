He's famous for his bold and rather outrageous designs but this could just well be Henry Holland's most outlandish creation yet.

Created for the opening ceremony of Leeds' newest shopping centre, Trinity Leeds, Holland's record-breakingly lengthy dress is a whopping 15 metres long - the equivalent of three double decker buses - and 480 square metres wide.

Th world's longest designer dress was modelled for the occasion by aerial acrobat and former Cirque Du Soleil principle artist, Colette Morrow.

Thousands of shoppers watched on in awe as the larger than life dress emerged from a giant gift box in the shopping mall's central atrium.

Rising to the top of the beautiful domed roof and filling the space beneath it with layers of silk, Manchester-born Holland's yellow and pink polka dot creation was embellished with thousands of glittering Swarovski crystals.

Holland said: 'Curating the launch ceremony for Trinity Leeds gave me the opportunity to celebrate fashion in a totally unique way.

'I was challenged to deliver a spectacular show that would excite Leeds shoppers and propel Trinity Leeds into the fashion spotlight.

'It has been an immensely rewarding project to work on and it has been great to hear the reaction from the public and see it all come to life on opening day.'

David Laycock, Trinity Leeds Centre Director, said: 'We wanted to create a memorable opening spectacle for the launch of Trinity Leeds, something which celebrated fashion and shopping in a unique way to showcase what Trinity Leeds and the city itself has to offer.

'After years of hard work, we're thrilled to be open to the public and canít wait to offer visitors to Trinity Leeds something new and exciting every time they visit.'
