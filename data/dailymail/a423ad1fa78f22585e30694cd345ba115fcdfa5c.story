Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz scored an outstanding header in stoppage time against Malaga to level the scoring in his side's La Liga opener - only for his effort to be ruled out by referee Antonio Mateu.

The 33-year-old Spanish custodian thought he had won his side a point only for the officials to deem that there was a foul in the build up to the goal.

Iraizoz leaped above Malaga's defence to head past his former Espanyol team-mate Carlos Kameni before running away in celebration following what he thought was a crucial equaliser.
