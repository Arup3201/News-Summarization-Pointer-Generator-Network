Thanks for following Sportsmail's live coverage of Lewis Hamilton's victory at the US Gran Prix. 24 points ahead with two races to go! See you next time...

Hamilton: 'This is an incredible place. Huge thanks to the fans. We've got an incredible team. I'm really excited and it's such a privilege to represent my country here. '

So, we hear the National Anthem and Hamilton is presented with his well-earned trophy. 

It was the 32nd victory of Hamilton's career, making him the most successful Briton in F1 in terms of race wins, edging him ahead of 1992 champion Nigel Mansell.

Hamilton also becomes the first non-German to win 10 races in a season, with Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher both having won 11 and 13 apiece in past years.

'Get in there Lewis, get in there, mate,' shouts his engineer.  'Epic drive, mate, epic.'

How it finished - 1.Hamilton, 2.Rosberg, 3.Ricciardo, 4.Massa, 5.Bottas, 6.Alonso, 7.Vettel, 8.Magnussen, 9.Maldonado, 10.Vergne.

He's done it! Hamilton wins the US grand Prix to move further ahead of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg who follows him in second place. Hamilton stretches his Championship lead to 24 points. 

It's another Mercesed one-two as Ricciardo finishes in third. A brilliant race from the Australian, who had started in fifth on the grid. 

We're into the final stages and it looks as though Hamilton will break Nigel Mansell's record of 31 F1 wins. Button has been caught late on as Vettel surges through the field. He's in ninth place which is good going considering his terrible start. 

2.4seconds is the gap between Hamilton and Rosberg, while Ricciardo continues to fight off Massa in third. 

Lap 50 - Massa hasn't given up on a podium position as he chases down Ricciardo. The Brazilian's team have just told him that they suspect Ricciardo has a problem. 

Maldonado almost touches Grosjean as he overtakes the Frenchman and heads into ninth.

Rosberg reduces the gap behind Hamilton and the German is now just 1.9 seconds away.

How they stand after lap 47

1. Ham 2. Ros 3. Ric 4. Mas 5. Bot 6. Vet 7. Alo 8. Mag 9. But 10. Mag

Lap 44 - Vettel takes Alonso to move up into sixth place. Alonso was ahead in the hairpin but the German got the better of him on the straight. 

Hulkenberg's reason for retirement was down to an engine failure. He told his team that he could smell oil and they told him to stop immediately. 

The Mercedes team tell Rosberg that he is 2.6seconds behind Hamilton, but his tyres are in good shape. Elsewhere, Ricciardo is now 1.8seconds clear of Massa in third.

1. Ham 2. Ros 3. Ric 4. Mas 5. Bot 6. Alo 7. Mal 8. Rai 9. Kvy 10. Mag

Rosberg isn't giving up yet - He's just recorded the fastest lap of the day - 1:42.38. 

Hamilton is currently 2.3secs ahead of Mercedes rival Rosberg. Ricciardo moves up once again as the Australian takes advantage of a pit stop from Massa. It's been a brilliant race from Ricciardo so far. He also records the fastest lap of the day - 1.42.8.

Lap 29 - Alonso moves up to sixth as he continues his charge and overtakes Magnussen. Elsewhere, Grosjean and passed Vettel for ninth place. Vettel is having a torrid time - he's three pit stops in already. 

He's done it! The crowd, who seem to be behind Hamilton, go mad as the Brit manages to squeeze past Rosberg. Hamilton shot down the inside, forcing Rosberg to yield and give Hamilton the lead. 

Hamilton is getting closer and closer to Rosberg. Separated by just a couple of car lengths. The German seems to be struggling for one reason or another.

Meanwhile, Alonso and Button continue their battle towards turn one. Definitely one to keep an eye on.  

Lap 21 - Rosberg's lead is getting cut by Hamilton and the Brit was four tenths of a second behind his team-mate on lap 20.

Alonso and Button battle it out for 8th place. The Spaniard takes Button before the English driver regains the position as Alonso fails to take advantage of his original move. 

Here's a look at how they stand after the first batch of pit stops.

1. Ros 2. Ham 3. Mas 4. Ric 5. Bot 6. Kvy 7. Mag 8. But 9. Alo 10. Vet

Nico Hulkenberg is OUT as the Force India driver seems to have stopped just past the home straight. 

Strange one as there doesn't seem to have been any sort of collision... That's both Force India's out of the race. 

Ricciardo takes Bottas as his decision to pit works perfectly. The Australian moves up to seventh. 

Lap 16 - Hamilton has a poor 14th lap and is clearly struggling for grip as the Briton falls two seconds behind Rosberg.

His seem to be suffering as his Mercedes team ask him for a grip update. Rosberg pits and gets the medium tyres on. 

Massa, in third, pits while Ricciardo follows closely behind. This could put Ricciardo ahead of Bottas. The Australian goes onto the medium tyre. 

'Front left is finished', says Rosberg as it looks like the German will have to pit soon. This could play into Hamilton's hands, who looks to have more laps in his tyres. Hamilton has slipped out of the DRS zone, however. Is he struggling with his tyres as well? 

Hamilton is told he's safe on fuel and has started to put the pressure on Rosberg. He's closed in to within 0.8 seconds of the leader.

Both Rosberg and Hamilton record their fastest laps of the afternoon so far as we enter lap 8. 

Vettel, who has already pitted twice, moved up from last place to 15th. Meanwhile, Hamilton is currently 1.1 seconds behind Rosberg. 

We're back underway at the end of lap 4 as the safety car leaves the track. 

Ricciardo makes up for a poor start with a brilliant move past Alonso to move up to fifth. Fantastic driving from the Australian. 

Adrian Sutil's race is over as the Sauber driver clashes with Perez. The safety car is out and as the replays are shown it's clear there can be no one to blame other than Perez. 

The Mexican shunted Sutil as he seemed to lose control on the corner. Lots of debris and damage to both cars.

That's Perez and Sutil out of the race.

And they're off! Rosberg gets away brilliantly but so does Hamilton. Bottas struggles to stay in third after pressure from Massa and Alonso.

Massa takes Bottas to move up to third!

Rosberg has established as good a lead as he could hope for at this early stage. 

We're just moments away from the lights go off here as the Circuit of the Americas welcomes a full house of race fans.

Can Hamilton grabs his 32nd Formula One win to overtake Nigel Mansell? No doubt that record won't be in his mind as he concentrates solely on chasing down Rosberg in pole. 

 

Keanu Reeves and Pamela Anderson have just sauntered through the starting grid. The former Baywatch actress tell Sky Sports: 'I love the noise. I love the people. Fast cars and fast women.'

Reasonably amicable pre-race interview with Hamilton and Rosberg. 

Hamilton tells Sky Sports: 'It's incredible (the atmosphere). We've got a great crowd here today. I'm hoping my breaks will be OK. I'm excited about actually doing some racing.'

'The priority is always for the team, but we obviously we want to finish ahead of each other.'

Rosberg adds: 'The team come first but it's time to focus on myself a little bit. Our battle has always been aggressive and that's not going to change.'

Before we get going, let's take a look at where we stand the the Drivers' Championship. As we've mentioned, Hamilton leads, but only by 17 points. It's a big day for his closest challenger Rosberg.
