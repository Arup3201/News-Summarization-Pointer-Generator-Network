Some tennis fans may go to the lengths of camping overnight to show their support for Andy Murray.

But Gemma, 24, and Johnny Hitchcock, 26, decided to lend their backing to Britain’s number one at Wimbledon in a rather more unusual fashion - by installing a tennis court in their living room.

The couple, who live in a three-bedroom house in Woodville, Derbyshire, ensured that if rain stops play during the competition in SW19, they will be able to play a match in the comfort of their home.

Mrs Hitchcock admitted she was not impressed at first with the idea which came from her husband, but now has accustomed herself to the new-look living room in their semi-detached home.

‘I thought he was joking but then he started looking into it properly and getting measurements done, and it just went from there,’ said Mrs Hitchcock, an account manager for a public relations agency.

‘We’ve had a bit of stick about it from friends and family who think we are nuts - but I think it looks good. It’s not every day you can boast about having a tennis court in your home.’

The couple - who were pictured in a photoshoot for their new living room with friends Jessica King, 18, and Keely Hodgekiss, 20 - will be playing host when the Scot takes to the court at Wimbledon.

Mrs Hitchcock added: ‘We’re going to have friends round when Murray’s playing and get the Murray mania in full swing. I’ve got a good feeling about this year.’

Technical administrator Mr Hitchcock added: ‘It started off as a bit of a joke that was discussed one night in the pub and the more we talked about the more I wanted to do it.’

Their living room was turfed out by Bradleys Surfacing Systems of Birmingham.

Company director Tom Bradley said: ‘We’ve done similar things to balcony’s in people’s flats and carry out tennis court installations on a regular basis.

'However this is the first time we’ve completed one in someone’s lounge before.’
