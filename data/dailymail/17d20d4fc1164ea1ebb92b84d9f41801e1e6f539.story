Jailed: Douglas Bailey has been sentenced to five years in prison for killing his wife Hazel

A pensioner who beat his wife to death with his walking stick after a row about the heating has been jailed for five years.

Douglas Bailey, 79, was obsessed with money, even though he had tens of thousands of pounds in savings.

He clubbed his 82-year-old wife Hazel 22 times around the head and neck and punched her so hard her false teeth fell out.

He was furious because she had turned the central heating on when it was only early September, police sources said.

It is believed Mrs Bailey had been dead for two days by the time her body was found after the attack last year.

The couple’s window cleaner raised the alarm when Bailey answered the door in blood-stained pyjamas, a court heard yesterday.

He alerted a neighbour who went round to check up on the couple. 

At first Bailey lied that his wife was at a friend’s house, but eventually admitted: ‘It’s Hazel. She’s dead. I have killed her.’

The couple had been married for 45 years and did not have any children. They lived in Winsford, Cheshire, in a bungalow Bailey had built himself.

The retired joiner, who was later diagnosed as being in the early stages of dementia, looked confused yesterday as a judge said his crime was so serious he had no choice but to send him to prison, despite his age.

Home: The killing took place at the Baileys' bungalow in Winsford, Cheshire in September last year

‘It is a tragedy to see you here at 
your age and that your wife of so many years is dead at your hands,’ 
Judge Elgin Edwards told him. ‘This was a brutal attack on a vulnerable 
old lady of nearly 83 years.’

The
couple used be ‘well turned out’ and keep their home spotless, Chester 
Crown Court was told.

In recent years, however, they had been in 
declining health and struggled to look after themselves.

Mrs
Bailey had sciatica and needed help getting about, but her husband had 
shown little sympathy, neighbours later told police.

Mrs Bailey had also
been seen with bruises, apparently inflicted by her husband, but police
had not been informed and the ‘proud’ couple had rejected help from 
social services.

Simon 
Medland QC, prosecuting, said Bailey’s concern about the heating was 
part of an obsession with saving money.

He added: ‘Whilst they had not 
much by way of income, they had tens of thousands of pounds in shares, 
owned their bungalow outright, which is a valuable, substantial 
property, and £68,000 in bank cash.’

Bailey
was in custody for more than a year while experts compiled reports on 
his mental health, finally concluding he had been suffering from 
dementia.

As a result, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds 
of diminished responsibility.

Mr
Medland said the killing would otherwise have been ‘a grave case of 
murder, involving the killing of an 82-year-old woman by protracted, 
substantial violence’.

He 
added: ‘She must have known it was her husband inflicting the injuries 
on her and it was plain death was far from instantaneous.’

Last night Mrs Bailey’s cousin, Andrew Buckley, said: ‘Hazel was a very kind and devoted wife and certainly didn’t deserve to end her life in this cruel and tragic way.’
