An underwater 'Grand Canyon' has been captured in a series of spectacular images created by a Royal Navy survey ship.

HMS Enterprise discovered the 250 metre-deep canyon in the Red Sea during a nine-month mission to improve understanding of the waters east of Suez.

The 3D images were created after the ship left the Egyptian port of Safaga and were made using the Devonport-based survey ship's multibeam echo sounder.

Commander Derek Rae, said the features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the Red Sea flooded millennia ago

Commander Derek Rae, commanding officer of HMS Enterprise, said: 'These features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the Red Sea flooded millennia ago.

Submarine canyons are steep-sided valleys cut into the sea floor.

The
deepest below-water canyon in the world is in the Bay of Biscay off the
coast of Spain, which falls nearly 5,000m underneath the surface.

Other canyons of note are in the Hudson and Amazon rivers. A canyon in the Congo is the largest river canyon in the world.

The major mechanism of canyon erosion is now thought to be turbidity currents and underwater landslides.

Turbidity currents are dense, 
sediment-laden currents which flow downslope when an unstable mass of 
sediment that has been rapidly deposited on the upper slope fails, 
perhaps triggered by earthquakes.

'Some may be far younger and still in the process of being created by underwater currents driven by the winds and tidal streams as they flow through this area of the Red Sea, carving their way through the soft sediment and being diverted by harder bed rock.

'Or there is always the possibility that they are a combination of the two.

'It is, however, almost certain to say
that this is the closest that humans will ever get to gaze upon these 
truly impressive sights hundreds of metres beneath the surface.'

The echo sounder, which is fitted to 
Enterprise's hull, produces the images from the echoes returning from 
the sound pulses it sends out.

This is a highly accurate way to measure the sea bed to determine if the depth of water is safe for navigation and shipping.

HMS
Enterprise will remain in the Middle East until the summer to continue 
its task of updating some of the 3,300-plus Admiralty Charts which are 
used by many of the world's seafarers, including the Royal Navy.
