A retired army nurse is facing a council tax hike of £1,000 a year after inspectors ruled her property is actually two distinct homes.

Nerys Davies will now get two monthly bills after her four-bedroom house in Cerrgydrudion, Conwy, was judged to be 'two self-contained units'.

Miss Davies, who served with the Army for 26 years, called the decision 'absolutely shocking'. But inspectors have held firm and dismissed her attempt to appeal.

Nerys Davies outside her four-bedroomed property - now officially two separate homes for tax purposes

The 56-year-old has only paid one bill to the council since she bought the house and its annex, which she uses as a utility room, 20 years ago.

But now inspectors have told her that this 'granny flat' section of her property could potentially be used as another home and ought to be billed accordingly.

That means she will have to cough up the cash for lots of council tax, amounting to £2,500 a year, when previously she paid between £1,500 and £1,800 for a single property.

'It’s absolutely shocking because I’ve owned this house since 1995 and I’ve always paid my council tax,' she said.

'The extension was built well before I moved in here and now all of a sudden I’m being told it’s two separate houses.

'There’s only a flimsy door between the two so I don’t think a family would want to live in that tiny space if there was another family right next door.

'I used to pay around £1,600 to £1,800 tax as my house fell into the band F category.

'But now I’ve been told it will be split into two meaning it will be classified as a three-bedroom house and a one-bedroom flat under categories E and A.'

Council inspectors told Miss Davies that there was ‘no breach of planning control’ and that ‘nothing has been compromised’ at her property.

She tried to reverse the decision but her appeal was dismissed at a valuations tribunal hearing, despite Valuations Office Agency officer David Taylor conceding it might not be possible to sell the building as two properties.

Miss Davies said: 'The process was incredibly confusing and whenever I tried to ask questions I felt like I was being ignored.

'The council told me that I hadn’t broken any rules by having the cooker and utility facilities in the extension when they visited in January.

'But then the VOA evaluators came and said that it was two separate properties.

'I was absolutely stunned so I asked them how it could possible be another house as it didn’t have a proper exit.

'So people living there would have to come through into what would be the house next door.

'It’s only about three metres wide and three metres long anyway and is exactly the same size as it was in the original plans when I moved here.

'I’ve been all over the world in my job and I’ve seen some pretty grim things but this whole situation has completely baffled me.'

The letter from the council informing Miss Davies of the change in her home's council tax status

A spokesman for the Valuations Office Agency (VOA) said: 'The VOA is responsible for allocating council tax bands in England in Wales.

'We cannot comment on individual cases.

'Where part of an existing home is built or adapted for use as separate living accommodation, it may be treated as a self-contained unit and have its own council tax band.

'If an occupier disagrees with that decision they can appeal.

'The VOA is also happy to review the council tax band of any domestic property, free of charge and without an appeal.

'Billing authorities may also apply an exemption from the council tax bill. Local councils will deal with any questions about payments and exemptions for council tax bills.'
