Bolton player Marvin Sordell was racially abused by a 13 year old Millwall fan

A 13-year-old football fan has been banned by Millwall FC after admitting to racially abusing a player during a match last month.

Millwall have offered the boy a place on a 
'Millwall for All' educational programme, instead of imposing a full life ban, 'in the hope that we can change 
his outlook on equality, racism and life in general'.

The incident occurred during Millwall's 
2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers at the New Den on October 6.

An investigation involving both clubs and the Football Association started after the teenager verbally abused Bolton player Marvin Sordell.

Millwall today confirmed the teenager had admitted abusing the player and has subsequently issued a written apology to Sordell.

The club's statement was released in conjunction with notices from the FA and Bolton.

'Firstly we would like to put on record how grateful we are for the support and co-operation we have received from Bolton Wanderers and The FA in resolving what has been a challenging and topical issue over the past four weeks,' the statement read.

'Having completed our investigations into the incident, we have identified and interviewed a 13-year-old boy who admitted a verbal exchange with Marvin Sordell in which abuse was used.

'The individual has been banned from Millwall matches for the foreseeable future, but as a club we also felt, given the boy's age and background, we had a duty to play our part in attempting to educate and rehabilitate him.

'Accordingly, we have offered to put him through one of our education programmes, run by Millwall for All (formerly the Millwall Anti-Racism Trust) in the hope that we can change his outlook on equality, racism and life in general.

'In the meantime, the boy has written a letter to Marvin Sordell offering his apology, which has been accepted.'

While tackling the individual responsible, Millwall also went on to critique the media response to Sordell's complaint.

The club believe the scale of the abuse was overplayed in some quarters and did little to mask their frustration.

'We would also like to put on record how disappointed everybody at Millwall FC was in the way in which the initial allegations were reported in some sections of the media,' the statement continued.

'These reports were made with no knowledge of the facts and created the impression that Bolton players were subjected to racial chanting or systematic abuse by more than one individual.

'We trust that, now the facts have emerged, certain individuals will reflect on the reports they made.

'Finally, it is our hope that all of us within football, including governing bodies, clubs, players, fans and the media can continue to work together to build on the progress that has been made over many years in effectively tackling the issue of racism in our game, rather than merely sensationalising, and thereby trivialising it.'
