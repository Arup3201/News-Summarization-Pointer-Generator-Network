Liverpool have revealed they expect their income to surge by £25m a year when their expanded main stand opens next year. Around £20m of that cash will come from 8,500 extra seats, including 4,500 corporate seats.

The club also hope to make £5m a year from getting a naming rights sponsor for the stand - while keeping the name Anfield for the ground as a whole. Extra income could also follow because the new Anfield will be eligible and fit to stage major European club finals.

The details are revealed in an interview with Liverpool’s chief executive Ian Ayre in the new edition of FC Business magazine.  Liverpool desperately need extra match-day income to help them catch up with major rivals already housed in much bigger stadiums, not least Manchester United and Arsenal.

Stadium expansion work began in December on the redevelopment of the Main Stand at Anfield

By the start of the 2016-17 season it is expected that the stadium redevelopment will be completed

45,000 - Anfield's current capacity

54,000 - Capacity after initial expansion 

58,800 - Potential capacity after second phase

8,500 - Phase one to extend the Main Stand

4,500 - Phase two to extend Anfield Road end 

£75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season 

£260m - cost of overall regeneration in Anfield

Anfield’s current capacity is just shy of 45,500 and the first phase of expansion - with building work just underway - will take that to 54,000 by the start of the 2016-17 season. A second phase could see the Anfield Road Stand expanded later by a further 4,800 seats.

The expansion will cost £100m but the club will reap the benefits in the medium term. Ayre insists that adding a sizable amount of higher-priced corporate seats, often known as ‘prawn sandwich’ places, is key to the scheme’s viability.

‘Corporate hospitality revenues are essential,’ Ayre says. ‘If we had increased capacity by 8,500 general admission seats only, it would have taken a ridiculous time to pay back the investment, meaning revenues into the team would have been affected.

‘But the large corporate increase means we will pay the debt back quickly and not be saddled with debt, while quickly increasing revenues into the playing squad. 

Liverpool's new Main Stand will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for Reds fans

The Main Stand will have two new tiers added to take the capacity to over 53,000 by start of 2016-17 season

‘The club wants the return on investment as quickly as makes sense. Liverpool has to be sustainable. We have formulated a model that gives a fast return of the capital expenditure over five to six years, but that will also allow the club to enjoy some benefits from the expansion even before that time. Beyond the five or six years, we will of course really see more revenues on the bottom line.’

Liverpool’s American owners Fenway Sports Group, who also own US baseball team the Boston Red Sox and successfully modernised their Fenway Park Stadium, are effectively lending Liverpool the stadium expansion money in the form of an interest-free loan, bypassing the need to meet crippling bank charges.

The £5m-a-year potential income in naming rights is an estimate floated by experts in that field. 

Ayre says: ‘The commercial department is in talks with various people. We didn’t think that looking for a naming rights deal on a stadium as iconic as Anfield made sense, but there are real value and benefits to be had around a naming rights deal on the new stand. 

There was plenty of building activity from workers on the opening day of the Anfield Main Stand redevelopment

‘It is not just a question of how much a deal is worth, but more about which deal would allow the club and partner to enjoy the most benefit.’

Not only will the club benefit enormously from the expansion, so will the wider area, with local regeneration directly creating 360 new long-term jobs according to economists. The numbers exclude construction and supply chain jobs, which, if included would see 770 jobs created.

The redevelopment will also allow Liverpool to host international fixtures and European finals in the future. UEFA insist upon at least a 50,000-capacity stadium, corporate accommodation and a minimum standard for players and match officials’ changing rooms - which will all be passed once the first phase has been completed.
