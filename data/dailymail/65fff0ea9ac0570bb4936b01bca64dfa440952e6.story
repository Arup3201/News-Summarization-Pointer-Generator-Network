David Cameron has written to the parents of a 10-year-old girl who died from a brain tumour and shared his own pain at losing a child.

Paula and David Holmes, of Penwortham, Lancashire, wrote letters to the Prime Minister and Health Secretary following the death of their daughter Katy, urging the Government to put more money into researching the cause of brain tumours.

Today, Mrs Holmes spoke of her delight after not only receiving a letter from the Prime Minister but also a handwritten response in which he talked about the pain of losing his son Ivan, who had severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died in 2009 aged six.

Mr Cameron wrote: 'I am so sorry to hear of your loss. I miss my Ive every day, but at least I do sometimes now feel happy and not sad when I think of him. The point that you make about causes and medicines is a really powerful one. I will check myself that the research programmes are properly directed.'

He adds: 'I know from my own experiences of losing a child how devastating it is and that the pain never truly goes away.'

In their letter, the couple urged Mr Cameron to consider their arguments for greater research with his 'Dad head' rather than as PM.

The Prime Minister signs off his letter: 'With love and best wishes David Cameron (with my Dad head firmly on!)'

Mrs Holmes, a mother of five, said: 'We are over the moon at getting this reply from David Cameron. We asked him to show us that he cared and by handwriting this letter, he has done exactly that.'

Katy died in January at Derian House Children's Hospice, Chorley, after she was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour in October. She had been a healthy and happy child up until a few weeks before her diagnosis, when Mrs Holmes grew worried after her daughter stopped smiling and started complaining of headaches and blurred vision.

At the time Mrs Holmes was pregnant with a baby girl, and as the aggressive cancer took hold she began to worry Katy would die before she had a chance to meet her new sister Scarlet.

She took the decision to have Scarlet induced three weeks early and, despite the tumour's rapid development, Katy held on long enough to hold her newborn sibling in her arms.
