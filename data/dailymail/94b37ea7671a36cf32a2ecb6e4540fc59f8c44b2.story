A salon boss threatened to employ only ‘fat, gay and lesbian’ stylists because he was fed up with staff having babies, a tribunal has heard.

In an angry outburst, Andrew Rodgers, 34, accused women of ‘draining resources’ by going on maternity leave, it is claimed.

The hairdresser is said to have justified his threat by saying gay people were less likely than straight people to have children.

Tribunal: Former salon manager Natasha Bramhall, 26, is claiming sex discrimination and unfair dismissal against Andrew Rodgers's business which operates three hair salons in Sheffield and employs 28 people

He allegedly added that he made an 
exception for fat heterosexual people – because ‘no one would want to 
have a baby with a fat person’.

The comments were reported in a sex discrimination hearing in which Mr Rodgers was branded a sexist bully by former employees.

Salon manager Natasha Bramhall, 26, says she was bullied out of her job after having her son, Alfie. 
Colleagues queued to support her at Sheffield employment tribunal.

Mr Rodgers, who is gay, allegedly 
resented employing women at his Funky Divas salon chain, which has three
branches in Sheffield.

Witnesses said he was ‘very sexist’ 
and picked on those who became pregnant because he did not want them to 
take maternity leave.

Building: Mr Rodgers, who runs a chain of salons called Funky Divas in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is accused of being a sexist bully by hairdressers who used to work for him

Nail technician Kirsty Diver, 32, said she was reprimanded for  taking time off to have a baby.

She said: ‘He stated that in future 
he will be employing only fat, gay and lesbian members of staff as  no 
one would want to have a baby with a fat person and gays and  lesbians 
would not need to be off for maternity or paternity leave.’

Tracey Everatt said that she quit because of her boss’s ‘poor’  attitude towards women.

She said: ‘Andrew used to say “I’m sick of these women draining the resources, I am going to make their life hell”.

‘He wanted to sack someone when he found out they were pregnant. He didn’t want the hassle.’

Miss Bramhall, who claims  sex 
discrimination and unfair  dismissal, said Mr Rodgers’s behaviour 
changed dramatically after she told him she was pregnant in 2009.

She said she was left to work alone in a run-down area and was not paid when she took time off for pre-natal appointments.

She added that he branded her a ‘drama queen’ for raising concerns about down-and-outs in the salon.

Miss Bramhall, of Darnall,  
Sheffield, said she returned to work in March 2011 after six months’ 
maternity leave – but quit in  September after finding she had 
effectively been demoted.

The tribunal heard Mr Rodgers was a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character who could erupt in anger.

One stylist said she had a 
miscarriage in the toilets while doing a client’s nails but was too 
scared to tell him. Another said she went into early labour in a salon 
after Mr Rodgers allowed her no breaks all day and just a cookie for 
lunch.

Mr Rodgers, of Ecclesfield,  
Sheffield, denies all the claims. He said he believed Miss Bramhall was 
aggrieved because he tried to stop her and another employee setting up a
salon in competition with his.

Asked about his ‘fat, gay and  
lesbian’ remark, he replied: ‘I don’t speak like that. It is ludicrous 
to think that. It is not my nature.’

The hearing was adjourned.
