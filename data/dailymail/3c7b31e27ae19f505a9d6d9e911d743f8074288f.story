It's the honey-stone pile that glowers out across Danish capital Copenhagen and is home to the country's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary.

But Frederik VIII's Palace, which sits within the Amalienborg Palace complex, isn't only popular with the crowds of tourists who flock there in hopes of catching a glimpse of a royal.

According to Danish sources, another fan of the palace is none other than the Duchess of Cambridge herself who was given a personal tour during her 2011 visit to Copenhagen.

Colourful: Frederik VIII's Palace in Copenhagen reportedly left the Duchess of Cambridge inspired

So enamoured of the palace was the Duchess during her 2011 visit to the Danish capital, which was on behalf of UNICEF, she reportedly asked Australia-born Mary for decorating tips.

'Mary showed them around their apartment at Amalienborg Palace and they loved the way they had combined their collection of modern art with antique furniture,' a Royal Court source revealed to Royalista.com.

'Kate was truly inspired and wants to use some similar ideas in some of the rooms at Kensington Palace.' 

The Duchess of Cambridge, who is almost seven months pregnant with her second child, recently moved into a palatial new home in Norfolk called Anmer Hall.

Striking: Renovations on the 4,800sqm property were completed in 2010 and include some modern touches

Renovations at the Grade I listed home reportedly cost £1.5m, including £500,000 for replacing the roof tiles and another £500,000 on landscaping the lawn.

The property has also had a new kitchen put in after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are currently on holiday in Mustique with Prince George, decided the existing £175,000 kitchen wasn't to their taste.

Frederik VIII's Palace, which was built betweenn 1750 and 1760 for Baron Joachim Brockdorff, also underwent expensive renovations before its current occupants moved in.

Home to current monarch Queen Margrethe's Swedish mother Ingrid until her death in 2000, the palace lay empty for 10 years, with the present royals moving in in 2010. 

Eye-catching: The most striking additions are the colourful murals created by contemporary artists

Tasteful: The murals are offset by tasteful beige walls and limited amounts of gilding

Stylish: Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary also have light sculptures by Olafur Eliasson

Before they did, the 250-year-old 4,800sqm palace was completely redecorated over five years at a cost to the Danish taxpayer of 220m Danish Krone (£22m).

Along with enormous crystal chandeliers and tasteful beige walls, the palace is also home to a series of murals and artworks created by Danish contemporary artists, among them the Icelandic-Danish sculptor, Olafur Eliasson.

Another, by artist John Kørner, is themed around Afghanistan and shows camels, stately palm trees and soldiers silhouetted against a colourful Afghan sunset.

Speaking to CNN shortly after moving in, Crown Prince Frederik revealed that some thought his choice of murals, in particular the Afghan artwork, was a brave one.

Inspired: The palace cost a total of £22m to renovate and was briefly opened to the Danish public

Minimalist: Apart from the mural, the kitchen is strikingly minimalist and includes pared-back pine units

'People were amazed that we had dared to do this,' he said. 'We took a chance, but we didn’t do it like gambling on a roulette or poker. It was calculated, but it was also a calculated risk from our hearts.' 

Other rooms are more traditional, including the beautiful Sun Room, which boasts a series of beautifully worked tapestries and delicate apple-green walls.

Equally striking is the kitchen which, along with having classically Scandinavian minimalist fittings, includes one wall completely covered by a mural featuring wildlife and flowers painted by Danish artist, Kathrine Artebjerg.

LK Bennett Autumn Winter 2011 Ami Coat

The Duchess of Cambridge has one of the most coveted wardrobes around, spilling with designer dresses and sophisticated courts. But her style isn't just about high-end pieces, she's known just as much for wearing high-street too from Whistles to REISS, ZARA and L.K.Bennett. And coincidentally, she is wearing L.K.Bennett here.

Pictured here she was showing her royal support for Armistice Day in regal red - how appropriate.

This elegant wool coat from the  Autumn Winter 2011 collection featured a high collar, epaulets and a clinching waist belt that showed off her slender figure. She looked super sophisticated in the pick that she teamed with her suede knee boots.

We've seen this winning combination on her quite a few times and that's just one of the things we love about her - her fashion recycling. Sadly, the 'Ami' coat is quite old so it's now sold out, but maybe we can tempt you with one of the royally red coats below instead?
