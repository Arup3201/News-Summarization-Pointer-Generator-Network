They have been a common sight in circuses for years, but a pair of daredevils from Germany have taken the art of unicycling to new heights.

Lutz Eichholz and his friend Stephanie Dietze have just completed a 9,000-feet descent down the Dolomites mountain range in Italy.

It is the latest and highest challenge the German adrenalin junkies have tackled to date.

High life: Lutz Eichholz and his friend Stephanie Dietze have just completed their biggest challenge yet

Four-time world champion Eichholz has been pedaling across cliffs and deserts all over the world for 16 years, but that made his and Dietze's latest venture down the Cima Ombretta Orientale mountain no less daunting.

Eichholz a student from Germany, said: 'It's at times like this that I realise just how thin the line between 
success and failure can be.

'Riding down the Dolomites on a 
unicycle is a major challenge, even after more than 16 years of extreme 
unicycling. The terrain is particularly craggy and steep.

On the edge: Lutz and Eichholz dice with death for the love of their hobby and are often injured in the pursuit of the buzz

Beer: Lutz says he likes nothing better when he reaches the summit than rewarding himself with a cold beer

Dismount: Even the intrepid duo are sometimes forced to dismount and carry their unicycles when there is no other way through

Perilous: The pair have to bunny hop down sheer rock face and are often forced to leap off their unicycles during their descent

'The massive mental effort means that as time goes on, it gets harder and harder for me to concentrate.

'But when I'm enjoying my summit beer at the end, there is no better feeling in the world.'

The 26-year-old has been unicycling since he was just nine years old, is a pioneer of the extreme sport and has travelled the world to indulge his heart-stopping hobby.

Don't look down: The duo, balancing expertly high up in the Dolomites, are just inches from death

It is not the type of activity for the faint-hearted and the sport has even spawned its own terminology for the many injuries it 
can cause, such asÂ  'shindentations' (marks where rocks puncture the 
front of the legs) and 'calf tracks' (thin scars where the pedals cut 
into the back of the calves).

Earlier in the year Lutz and Dietze paid a separate trip to the Dolomite's and filmed their perilous descent.

Speed demon: Four times world champion Lutz Eichholz demonstrates what it's all about

X marks the spot: The duo take a breather and enjoy the view from the summit

Lunar landscape: The Dolomites are said to be particularly challenging due to its craggy surface

Safer ground: The pair back down at the foot of the mountain after their strenuous effort

Peddle power: The duo are often left injured by their exploits and the sport has even developed its own terms to describe the injuries

They were sponsored by Adidas, who funded a professional cameraman to record 
their unbelievably dangerous feats.

The riders are often forced to bail on their one-wheeled machines, which have similar tyres to mountain bikes, if they take a spill during their hair-raising journey.

Record breaker: Lutz Eichholz (right) holds the world record for successfully completing a 6m drop.

They have to 'bunny hop' down sheer rock faces, fight to maintain their balance on the treacherous shale beneath them and teeth-grindingly pedal up arduous steep slopes.

Lutz is also the world record holder for the highest ever unicycle drop, landing a plunge from 6m of an overhanging rock in the Moroccan desert.
