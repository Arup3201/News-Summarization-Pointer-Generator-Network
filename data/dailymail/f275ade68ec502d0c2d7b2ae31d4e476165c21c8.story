A woman dubbed the UK's most evil mother - who was charged but not convicted over her son's murder - has again pleaded her innocence and called for fresh information on the 20th anniversary of the killing.

Rikki Neave, six, was strangled and left for dead, naked, in woodland near Peterborough's Welland Estate - just 500 yards from his family home - on November 29, 1994. 

His mother, Ruth Neave, was charged with his murder but a jury found her not guilty at Northampton Crown Court.

Ruth Neave and her husband Gary Rogers today launched a fresh appeal for information about the murder of Mrs Neave's son, Rikki Neave, who was found dead near his family home, on November 29, 1994

However, she admitted charges of causing child cruelty to Rikki and his two sisters, Rebecca, then eight, and Rochelle, three, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. 

The case caused a national outcry after details of the horrific abuse Rikki suffered at his mother's hand became public.

Mrs Neave, who moved from Peterborough after being freed in 2000, today held a press conference at the Oliver Cromwell Hotel in March, Cambridgeshire, were she appealed for information to catch her son's killer.

The 45-year-old acknowledged that the perception that she had killed her son still lingered, but claimed the real killers were a sex abuse gang.

She called for those living on Welland Easte to come forward: 'We know you know something about where Rikki was that night and who killed him and why he was killed.

She claimed the estate was riddled by criminals in 1994, the year Rikki was killed.

Mrs Neave said: 'Many had a lot to hide and lied in their statements and even got immunity.

'But we'll fight this to the end on our own if need be - other people have their agenda, I say get on with it,'

She added: 'It could have been your mother, father, uncle, aunt, son, daughter, cousin or even an old/new neighbour who acted weird that night or probably never came home that night until after 7 am the following day.

'These people are not going to come forward lightly, I am not silly, but a prick of conscience may play a part somewhere.

'If anyone saw one, two, three or even four people early that Tuesday morning between 4-8am in the area of Belvoir Way Woods or Eye Road we would be so grateful.'

She asked anyone with information to call police, Crimestoppers, or to contact her though the email address justiceforrikki.info@mail.com. 

Mrs Neave claimed police had wrongly charged her because she was an 'easy target' and said she had been pressured into pleading guilty to the neglect charges. 

Speaking before the press conference she told how the last 20 years of her life had been a 'nightmate' and said when Rikki died 'I died inside too'.

Mrs Neave claimed she had been intimidated, bullied and threatened, but despite now being crippled by arthritis, was as determined as ever to 'do what I have to do to get to the truth and no-one is going to stop me'

But as she restated her innocence at the press conference, her daughter, Rochelle Neave, now 23, recalled the horror of growing up in the family home: 'Although I was only young I can still remember the abuse.

'I can remember her dragging my sister up the stairs by her hair and there was never any food in the house. She spent all her money on drugs.

'I don't know why she's dragging this up 20 years later. She should let it lie.

'She may have been cleared of murder but she was convicted of cruelty and I don't think the police will find anybody else responsible for his death.'

And protesters gathered outside the hotel objecting to Mrs Neave continuing to plead her innocence and appeal for information. 

Steven Fox, 45, was among the protesters outside the hotel, who objected to Mrs Neave's public appeal. 

He said: 'As a single dad bringing up two boys who suffered abuse from their mother, I don't think it's appropriate that she's doing this here.

'The local community still feels very strongly about what she did and feelings still run deep.' 

Rikki had been on social services 'at risk' register and there had been a history of abuse by Mrs Neave.

Mrs Neave said her other children, who were all taken into care and later adopted, had been 'brainwashed' against her and had frozen her out of their lives. She is no longer in contact with them.

She said: 'If they want to talk to me, they know where I am.

'I will prove that I should never have been accused of cruelty.'

Mrs Neave said she had evidence that Rikki was in fact killed by a sex abuse gang which she had passed on to Cambridgeshire Police. 

She said: 'I know people out there think I'm a murderer but I'm determined to prove that somebody else did this to my boy.'

She hopes Cambridgeshire Police will act on her concerns within the next four months.

Detective Superintendent Paul Fullwood, from Cambridgeshire Police, said any action taken by the family is 'a matter for them'.

But he said police had met with Mrs Neave and her husband Gary Rogers, 52, last month and agreed to re-examine a 'numbers of matters they raised'. 

There was 'insufficient evidence' to start a fresh investigation, Det Sup Fullwood said, but the case would remain open until ' those responsible for the tragic death of Rikki can be brought to justice'.

Mrs Neave and Mr Rogers married in 2010 and launched their quest for a fresh investigation into Rikki's murder from their flat in Cambridge. 

She said: 'I feel let down by everyone - police, social services and people who just chucked me under a bus for what reason to save their own skin.'

'All the lies in the statements and to the media were all about money.

'I have been telling the truth for 20 years and no-one has listened or took anything on board in what I have been saying until I met my new husband Gary.'

Of her late son, Mrs Neave said: 'My Rikki was the most beautiful person I have ever known, he was sweet, cheeky, and full of life and mischief and he had not a bad bone in his body.

'I love him so much it hurts.

'Rikki was so very bright.

'He idolised his sisters and yes there were tantrums, arguing, fall outs and shouting that went on, but he loved them totally.

'What really broke my heart that was the fact I never was allowed to have anything of Rikki and what was Rikki's was destroyed and trashed by neighbours.

'Photos of Rikki were sold to the press for drugs.'

Mrs Neave recalled the last time she saw her son, on the morning of November 28, 1994, when she got him up for school. She was 'knackered' but not asleep, and claims she heard him get dress and leave. But that afternoon he never came home. 

After alerting police a search was launched and he was found dead nearby.  

She said: 'Rikki was a challenge, but it would not be Rikki if he was good all the time.

'He knew right from wrong early in his life,' said Mrs Neave.

'He was a cheeky monkey, full of mischief and such a cute face he would look at me and put on his baby eyes - they made me melt every time.

'He was the cutest boy ever.'
