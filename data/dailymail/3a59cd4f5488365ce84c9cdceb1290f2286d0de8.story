Up to three feet of snow was dumped onto the Rockies on Monday when a spring storm hit Colorado.

The snow began falling on Mother's Day in Colorado and caused some power outages as it weighed down newly greening trees.

It was a stark contrast to New York City, which saw temperatures soar to 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday and Monday for a sunny start to the week.

Much of Interstate 80 in southern Wyoming was closed today after severe thunderstorms and tornadoes hit the Midwest.

A flash flood watch was in effect for portions of Oklahoma and Arkansas, where more than 4 inches of rain were possible.

Residents in eastern Nebraska were also cleaning up from Sunday's thunderstorms and twisters, which ripped roofs off homes and toppled buildings, but caused no major injuries.

People in the western Panhandle woke up to a blanket of heavy, wet snow.

In Wyoming, a 180-mile stretch of I-80 was closed between the Nebraska state line and Rawlins.

Another 200 miles of eastbound I-80 between the Utah state line and Rawlins also was closed because of snow and blowing snow.

Truck stops in southeastern Wyoming were full of stranded truckers.

Among those affected by the outages 
was Denver International Airport, where some escalators and elevators 
temporarily stalled Monday morning.

Airport spokeswoman Julie Smith said a backup generator spared the airport any major problems.

At
 least 27 arriving and departing flights were canceled due to the 
weather, but Smith said there were no major delays. Crews were working 
overnight to de-ice runways.

The lingering snow slowed down Monday morning's commute in the Denver area but driving conditions were worse in the mountains.

The weather appears to be to blame for at least one fatal crash Sunday on U.S. Highway 285 southwest of Denver.

The
 highway was one of the worst for accidents in the storm. Two law 
enforcement cruisers were also hit along the road in less than an hour 
responding to other crashes.

In Nebraska, officials said the storms
 damaged homes and businesses in or near Sutton, Garland, Cordova and 
Daykin, knocking out power. Parts of Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, were 
hit by strong thunderstorms and hail, which also caused some power 
outages.

'May snow certainly
 isn't unheard of here in Colorado, even down in the Denver metro area,'
 said David Barjenbruch, a National Weather Service meteorologist in 
Boulder.

'If we see the
 total accumulations that we are anticipating from this storm, we are 
certainly going to see a top 10 May snow event for the Denver metro 
area.'

In the West, high 
winds at the bottom of the storm sent dust blowing across Arizona and 
New Mexico, and the Los Angeles area had been under 'red flag' fire 
warnings, with authorities saying blazes could quickly spread out of 
control under low humidity, gusty winds and dry conditions.

The storm is the result of a low-pressure system moving east colliding with a cold air mass from the north.

While
 temperatures were expected to drop below freezing Monday night, 
spring-like weather was expected to return to the Rockies by Tuesday.
