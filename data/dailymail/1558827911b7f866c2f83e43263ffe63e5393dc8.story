These are the stunning photos that show a family of gorillas letting off some steam in the wet with a play fight.

The young apes appear to be having fun during the tussle, showing off their strength and energy by throwing punches and wrestling with each other while the adult members of the family take a rest nearby.

The pictures were taken by Stanford University biology professor Susan McConnell at the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda.

Stanford University professor Susan McConnell captured the tussle over the course of an hour

The young apes were play-fighting within the boundaries of the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda

She said: 'It was hilarious - I mean, the gorillas were like little kids having an absolute ball on a playground. It was clear they were having a blast!

'They went on for nearly an hour, but in fits and starts - they'd chase and tussle for a while, then either the silverback [dominant male] would get up and give them a 'knock it off, kids' grunt and stare, or they'd just get tired and laze about for a few minutes.

'Then they'd get up and go back at it for another round. Â 

'At the very end they sat down in the puddles and drank water off their wet fingers and toes.'

Professor McConnell, 55, also teaches an undergraduate course on conservation photography as well as researching neurological biology at the Californian university.

She said: 'I try to take photos of wild animals that show their beauty, their strength, their fragility, and the complexity of their behaviors.

'By photographing animals in their natural habitats, I hope to convey that these creatures exist only because the ecosystems in which they live have been preserved.

'I want viewers to connect emotionally with wildlife, to treasure our natural resources, and to take personal action to promote the sustainable use of these resources.'

The energetic display carried on in fits and bursts for an hour

There are though to be only 880 mountain gorillas left in the world, with the species under threat from a loss of their habitat as human settlements spread out, poaching, war and civil unrest.

Professor McConnell has spent time with mountain gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda, and lowland gorillas in the Central African Republic.

She said: 'Watching a family of mountain gorillas is a deeply emotional experience.

'Nearly everyone who visits experiences an extraordinary sense of connection with these animals, who are evolutionarily some of our closest cousins.

'They are expressive, tender toward their infants, tolerant of their kids, and protective of family members.'

The play-fighting saw the apes land punches on each other while the adult Silverback occasionally intervened to tell them to pipe down
