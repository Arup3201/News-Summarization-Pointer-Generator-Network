Busy workers can now shave on the go whenever they want - using a rechargeable USB razor.

The unique shaver is just four inches (10cm) tall and two inches (5cm) wide - which is smaller than a smartphone - and can easily be transported and slots into any trouser pocket.

It can be recharged via a USB port and a single four-hour charge provides 30 minutes of use.

The compact men's electric shaver, known as 'The USB Travel Shaver', comes with a foil razor.

It can be bought from online retailer Hammacher Schlemmer for £20 ($29.95) and comes with a cleaning brush and carrying case.

The foil razor easily slips off so it can be cleaned and the whole device weighs just 0.22lbs (100g).

A Hammacher Schlemmer spokeswoman said: 'Smaller than a smartphone, it slips into a carry-on or briefcase for easy portability.

'With its retractable USB connector, it powers up via any computer or USB adapter so you don't have to pack chargers, cables, or worry about extra power adapters on overseas trips.'

Using the USB connector it can be charged with any computer or USB adapter.

The shaver blades rotate at 8,000 RPM, with sharp blades and the foil razor delivering a 'comfortably close shave,' according to the company.

It also comes with a cleaning brush and carrying case, so you won't get hair everywhere if you decide to store it in a pocket or bag.

One reviewer on Hammacher's website said: 'Shaves very well, almost as well as my $120 full-size shaver.

'I use it for travel, for a quick shave in the car and in bed when I don't feel like get up to getting up to get my regular electric shaver. No cons at all for my purposes.'
