Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown has provided player ratings for Tottenham's home match against Liverpool.

Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno all managed to get on the scoresheet - but who stood out at White Hart Lane?

Tottenham (Team average 5.9)

Hugo Lloris - 5.5A day to forget. His kicking was not the best though he had little chance with the goals. 

Eric Dier - 5.5

Was solid until giving away the penalty, which seemed to affect his performance.

Younes Kaboul - 5

Looked rocky at times and always seemed nervous in possession.

Struggling to cope: Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul attempts to wrestle Mario Balotelli off of the ball

Jan Vertonghen - 5.5

Shaky in defence and was easily beaten on too many occasions.

Danny Rose - 5.5

Not the best of showings in front of the watching England manager.

Etienne Capoue - 6.5

Despite the score he tried to keep his team going, but Liverpool's movement was too good.

Passion: Tottenham Etienne Capoue did not give up hope of helping Tottenham get back into the game

Nabil Bentaleb - 6.5

Impressed with his quick passing of the ball but against Liverpool bossed the middle.

Eric Lamela - 6

Put in a shift but struggled to get any joy in attacking areas of the pitch.

Christian Eriksen - 5.5

Had a very quiet game by his standards. Failed to get on the ball enough to create.

Nacer Chadli - 6.5

Showed the most potential of Spurs' attacking players but missed a good chance.

Emmanuel Adebayor - 6.5

Can't question his work-rate but too often drifted away from the centre.

Eyes on the ball: Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor worked hard but couldn't break down Liverpool's defence

Subs: Townsend (for Eriksen 59, 5.5), Dembele (for Bentaleb 59, 6), Davies (for Rose 72, 6).

Not used: Friedel, Chiriches, Holtby, Kane.

Mauricio Pochettino - 6

A tough test after initial success. He’s the right man for the job but still finding out his best XI.

LIVERPOOL (Team average - 7) Simon Mignolet - 6.5

Untroubled for the most part but made a smart first-half save to deny Chadli.

Javier Manquillo - 6

Had a quiet game but played his part in a solid defensive display.

Dejan Lovren - 7.5

Caught out by the odd long ball but tidied up brilliantly and made good interceptions.

Solid display: Liverpool new boy Dejan Lovren showed why Brendan Rodgers wanted to sign him

Mamadou Sakho - 7

Sometimes looks uncomfortable in possession but was very solid defensively.

Alberto Moreno - 6.5

Learned from his mistake at City and showed blistering pace for his goal.

Steven Gerrard - 7

The perfect player for the base of a diamond. Nobody in Britain does it better.

Jordan Henderson - 7

Made intelligent runs, particularly for the first goal and played with real confidence.

Key player: Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson is now one of the first names on Rodgers' teamsheet

Joe Allen - 6.5

A key ingredient in midfield. Used the ball quickly and effectively.

Raheem Sterling - 8

Gets people off their seats with blistering runs. Grows every game.

Mario Balotelli - 7

Showed flashes of pace and power and only rustiness stopped him scoring a couple.

Daniel Sturridge - 7.5

Like Sterling he beat defenders with ease. Was not put off by Balotelli's arrival.

Running man: The pace of England international Raheem Sterling troubled Tottenham's defence

Subs: Can (for Allen 61, 6) Markovic (for Balotelli 61, 6), Enrique (for Sterling 86)

Not used: Jones, K Toure, Coutinho, Lambert. 

Brendan Rodgers - 8

Bounced back brilliantly after the loss at City and did not let Balotelli’s arrival disrupt his team’s style of play.

Phil Dowd - 7

Handled the game well, though the penalty had an impact. Tottenham will say it was soft, but if you get caught on the wrong side and put your hands on someone, you run that risk. Dowd made the right call.
