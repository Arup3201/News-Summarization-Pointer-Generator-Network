In a tragic shooting incident, a depressed father reportedly under severe financial strain opened fire on his wife and two children in Miami on Wednesday evening before turning the gun on himself.

Pilot Carlos Zuniga, 45, shot his wife Michelle, 43, outside the family home they had lived in for 20 years and then turned his attention to his 11-year-old boy Stefan and 14-year-old daughter Lauren.

All three were rushed to Jackson Memorial Ryder Trauma Center where Stefan later died from his wounds. Mother and daughter are in a critical condition.

According to family friends 45-year old Carlos Zuniga,had been suffering from depression over his financial situation before he shot his wife Michelle, daughter Lauren and son Stefan

'As officers arrived, screaming and possible gunshots were heard from inside the home,' said police spokesman Detective William Moreno to the Miami Herald.

'Officers quickly assembled a small team and made entry into the home to protect those in danger.'

A neighbor, Enrique Cal who heard the shooting, remarked on how sad the event was for the affluent neighborhood.

'Oh, yeah, it's tragic,' said Cal. 'He shot his own kids and wife, tried to kill everybody.'

'Those people never had any problems. They were very decent people. It's very sad, very sad, unbelievable that this happened.'

'The last shot that he fired was one that he took to himself,' he added. 'The wife was laying outside on the grass next to the sidewalk, and the daughter was brought out by a police officer, (he) dragged her out.'

Police said that as of Thursday, Michelle and Lauren remained in a critical condition and that each was shot multiple times.

Another neighbor Jennifer Pich said that the horrifying shooting unfolded very quickly.

'My room is right on the side of their house. I heard the two shots, we lowered the TV, and we heard the cry for help,' she said. 'A little girl screaming, 'Help.'

'It shocked me because she's just a little girl,' she said. 'Kids shouldn't get hurt.'

Police investigating why a father would attempt to kill his entire family have turned their attention to the hot-air ballooning company the former commercial pilot owned with his wife.

The couple opened the company in 2005 under the name Winds Aloft Aviation Inc. It was more commonly known as Miami Balloon rides and according to friends it had entered financial difficulties.

Zuniga had recently put one of his balloons on sale on an industry website. And Colin Graham, a family friend said he knew the family business did not seem to be doing so well professionally.

The website for the firm no longer operates properly and the telephone number listed does not connect.

Graham added that Zuniga had recently taken a job as an aviation safety inspector at the Federal Aviation Administration - who recently announced a swathe of job cuts.

Before the FAA, Zuniga worked as a pilot for DHL, an international package shipping company, and before that, flew 737s for Miami Air.

The Zunigas were married in 1998. Neighbors said Carlos Zuniga also had two adult children from a previous marriage.

'We’ve never heard them fight. The police have never come to the house,' Cal said of the Zunigas. 'I’m in shock.'

'It’s an extremely calm neighborhood,' said Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado, who lives about five blocks from the Zuniga residence. “Never, in my 30 years here, have I seen a violent crime in this neighborhood.'
