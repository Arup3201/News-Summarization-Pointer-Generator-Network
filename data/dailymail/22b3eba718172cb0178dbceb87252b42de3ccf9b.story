Four years after her 7-year-old son disappeared, an Oregon mother has posted emotional message saying she'll never stop looking for him.

Kyron Horman went missing on June 4, 2010 after his step-mom Terri Moulton Hormon dropped him off at Portland's Skyline Elementary for an early morning science fair.

The young boy's disappearance prompted the state's largest ever search operation, but he was never found and no arrests were made - though Terri Horman seemed a strong suspect.

Wednesday marks the four year anniversary of the day he went missing, and Kyron's mother marked the occasion by writing a message on Facebook.

In the post, Desiree Young talked about how much she misses her son and how she'll never give up hope that he'll one day be returned to her.

'I miss all of the giggles that have filled our home since he was born. The smiles that Kyron gives us are infectious and I am a different person without him to brighten my days,' Young said.

Broken up: Kryon's father Kaine has since divorced Terri Horman and taken custody of their younger daughter Kiara

'I will never give up looking for Kyron, I will never stop, and I promise all of my Kyron supporters...I will find my Kyron.'

Young has organized three private search parties for June 20, 21 and 22.

Kyron's father Kaine Horman has since divorced Terri Horman, and the two recently settled a custody dispute over their younger daughter Kiara.

Kaine Horman won custody of the girl, but her mother will be allowed to see her on strictly supervised visits.

In July 2013, Young hit Terri Horman 
with a civil suit, accusing her of kidnapping her son. She demanded she 
either return Kyron or reveal where she hid his body, in addition to 
demanding $10million in damages.

However, she dropped that suit eventually, saying she didn't want to interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation.
