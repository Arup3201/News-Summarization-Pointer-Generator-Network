Guilty: Berta Manzanero, 71, pictured arriving at court yesterday, was fined £300 after she admitted stealing the flowers from the grave in Barking

A woman who stole flowers from a child’s grave wept as she was brought to justice yesterday.

A hidden camera caught Berta Manzanero, 71, taking four potted plants worth £15.

After the images were published, Manzanero’s disgusted daughter phoned police and identified her.

Yesterday she was fined £300 after admitting theft.

She was supported by her son-in-law, but her daughter was not at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court in East London.

The family of 11-year-old road crash victim Robert Stringer, who was killed more than 30 years ago, installed the camera after thieves targeted his grave at Rippleside Cemetery in Barkingside almost every fortnight for 18 months.

They put up a sign pleading for the thefts to stop but it did not work, and others complained that they too had fallen victim.

Last month, the camera recorded clear images of Manzanero as she knelt down to help herself to the floral tributes.

The footage showed her taking the terracotta pots and their  contents and stuffing them into   large shopping bags before casually walking away.

Yesterday Manzanero, who moved to Britain from Spain in 1962, admitted taking the flowers as she visited the graves of her husband and mother, but insisted she was not responsible for the other thefts.

Prosecutor Ellen Warner said  Manzanero confessed what she had done to her daughter, who telephoned police.

After being arrested at her home  in Dagenham, Essex, she told  officers she took the flowers because they were ‘nice’ and intended to return them.

Manzanero’s solicitor Kaushik Ramdhary told the court that she suffered depression after her son, a City banker, committed suicide, leaving a wife and baby. This was soon followed by the deaths of her husband and mother.

Mr Ramdhary said she visited the cemetery once a month and did not need the flowers because she has a ‘lovely garden at home’.

Thief: Four pots of flowers, worth £15, were taken from Robert Stringer's grave Rippleside Cemetery. He died when he was 11 in the 1980s

Stolen: Berta Manzanero, who is a former NHS worker, is caught on camera bending down and taking the four flower pots

Getaway: She wanders off with the haul of flowers. The family of Robert Stringer set up the CCTV camera after a string of thefts from the grave

He said: ‘There was no need for her 
to steal flowers to put on her own family’s grave. She is very, very 
fond of flowers. On that particular day those four pots caught her eye.

'She turned back to look at them, she
picked them up and put them in her bag. It was impulsive. She knows 
what she has done is wrong and she knows that the family of the boy has 
been very, very upset. She asks that her apologies be passed to them.’

Last night, Robert’s cousin, taxi 
driver Stephen Rose, 37, said: ‘What she did was terrible and we’re glad
that she’s been brought to justice.’
