A football referee made history last night by becoming the first woman to officiate an NFL game.

Shannon Eastin served as the line judge for the San Diego Chargers' 21-13 preseason victory over the Green Bay Packers, making her the first female referee in the NFL's 97-year history.

All went well on the night for Eastin, who was only selected because an ongoing dispute with regular referees meant the NFL had to draft in replacements.

Wearing Number 27 on the back of her black-and-white striped uniform and with her hair tucked under her cap, Eastin seemed dwarfed by the players, but remained calm as she made history within the San Diego stadium.

The 42-year-old, who is from Arizona, also seemed to get the thumbs up from the coaches for her performance on the night.

'She was confident and in control,' said Chargers coach Norv Turner.

Packers coach Mike McCarthy added: 'I thought she did a good job of 
communicating. I was focused on the 
Packers, but there was communication before the game.'

Though she wasn't involved in many calls until late, Eastin appeared to stay steady among the giants and worked well alongside her seven-man crew.

The trailblazer got her shot at making history as a replacement official following a dispute between the NFL and the regular referees, who are now locked out.

The disagreement marks the first time in 11 years that the NFL has had to draft in replacements, who are scheduled to work 16 games over the weekend.

Hearing of the decision to use Eastin for last night's game, the locked out NFL Referees Association said that she should be barred, because she once took part in a World Series of Poker tournament.

The NFL has strict rules on its employees taking part in gambling.

However, the league vetted and accepted Eastin for the game and it seems she does have all the credentials to take her place on the NFL field.

She has 16 years' of experience and works as a referee in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I's Football Championship Subdivision.

Eastin joins a small group of women to crack the officiating ranks at the highest levels of sports.

Violet Palmer, one of Eastin's inspirations, began officiating NBA games in 1997 and is still in the league.

Bernice Gera became the first woman to
work in baseball's minor leagues, serving as an umpire in a New 
York-Penn League game in 1972.

Pam Postema umpired major league 
spring training games in 1989 and, thanks to a push by commissioner A Bartlett Giamatti, made it up to Triple-A for six seasons.

But she was fired
a few months after Giamatti's death. She filed a sex discrimination suit 
against the baseball organisation and settled out of court.

A multiple national judo champion as a child, Eastin also  owns a company called SE Sports Officiating, which trains officials in football and basketball.

Just before the game, Eastin seemed to fit right in and appeared relax as she chatted with the other officials, members of the chain crew and players.

Chargers tackle Jeromey Clary and 
linebacker Antwan Barnes sought her out, shaking her
hand and saying a few words before she ran down the sideline for the 
first time.

She spent most of the first half 
straddling the line markers and keeping track of the time, without much 
action on her side of the field.

But things picked up in the second 
half, when she had to break up a small skirmish between players and 
whipped her flag to the middle of the field for a holding call late in 
the third quarter

Eastin heard a few boos early in the 
fourth quarter from the hometown fans for a pass interference call on 
San Diego's Corey Lynch -- a call she appeared to get right -- and later
signaled touchdown when Green Bay's Marc Tyler dived in from one yard 
out.

She also gave a 
touchdown signal on a one-yard run by San Diego's Curtis Brinkley and 
was on the spot for a fumble recovery by the Chargers near Green Bay's 
bench in the closing seconds, although she did not have to climb into 
the pile to make the call.

Charges
coach Turner said afterwards: 'I think it's exciting for her. It's the 
first female official ever in the NFL. I got my picture taken with her 
before the game because it's history and it's reality.'

Her cap will now take it's place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Ohio.
