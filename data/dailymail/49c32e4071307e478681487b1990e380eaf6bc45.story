A Swedish man who once was considered a psychopathic serial killer has been freed, after authorities found that his eight murder convictions were based on false confessions.

Sture Bergwall was convicted of eight murders in a series of trials from 1994 to 2001 - despite there being no forensic evidence or witness statements - and confessed to more than 30 killings in total.

But the 63-year-old later recanted his confessions, saying that he made them to get attention and drugs, and prosecutors dropped the final murder charge in July last year.

Yesterday, a court in Falun, Sweden, ordered his release from a secure psychiatric unit where he has been held since 1991 - ruling that he should continue to receive care, but no longer in a closed unit.

Each of Bergwall’s convictions was overturned after prosecutors said they had no other evidence linking him to the deaths, some of which may not even have been murders.

‘He has been detained for 20 years in a locked psychiatric clinic. It is a miscarriage of justice,’ said his lawyer Thomas Olsson, adding that they will now start looking at whether to seek damages. 

Bergwall had been kept at the mental institution until now, waiting for a verdict on whether his mental health was good enough to let him out. His case is one that has gripped Sweden for years.

The Government launched a commission of inquiry last November looking into possible shortfalls in the legal system that may have resulted in Bergwall's convictions.

He relished his reputation as 
'Sweden's answer to Hannibal Lecter' and would happily regale anyone in 
ear shot with stories of murder, mutilation, rape and cannibalism.

His
 tales of how he strangled, stabbed, defiled and mutilated his victims 
captivated and horrified his homeland, cementing his standing as 
Sweden’s most prolific and deranged serial killer.

Some victims he claimed he stabbed, others he strangled and one he beat to death with a rock. Some he said he raped, others he chopped up and one he even claimed to have eaten.

But what was constant throughout all his gruesome confessions was the detail with which he described the murders: how he killed them, where he killed them, even their last words.

He managed to hoodwink judges, psychiatrists, journalists and the Swedish public, until he decided to make his most staggering confession of all: that he had made it all up.

His near forensic knowledge of many of the murders convinced detectives and prosecutors that he must have committed the crimes.

Nobody bothered to find out that he had studied the killings during regular trips to a local library on day trips from the asylum.

Bergwall, a convicted sex offender and bank robber who at the time had changed his name to Thomas Quick, had already been locked up in the Sater hospital for a botched bank robbery.

1976, Charles Zelmanovits, 15

He claimed to
 have picked the teenager up in his car by the side of a road. After 
persuading him to engage in a sexual act he said he strangled him, 
abused the body and cut it up with a saw in nearby woods. He said he 
took a leg as a souvenir.

1980, Johan Asplund, 11

He spotted Aspland by the side of a 
road and asked to check if he had run over a cat. When the boy bent over
he smashed his head against the door and dragged him into his car. He 
drove the boy into the countryside, where he sexually assaulted then 
strangled him. He buried some of the organs, put the hands on the car's 
front seat, the head, legs and torso in plastic bags. He said what he did no't throw out of the window he took home and ate.

1981, Trine Jensen, 17

After beating and raping her, he said he strangled her with the strap of her handbag

1984, Marinus and Janny Stegehuis

The
 Dutch couple were on a camping holiday. He said he stabbed the husband 
through the tent canvas and clambered inside. He described the attack in
 extraordinary detail, accurately numbering how many times each victim 
was stabbed.

1985, Gry Storvik, 23

He made the Norwegian female prostitute strip before he tortured her, and he described how she vomited as he strangled her.

1988, Israeli student, Yenon Levi, 24

He
 said he and an accomplice took the tourist, who was seeing relatives, 
to a holiday home in the woods and killed him when he tried to escape.

1988, Therese Johannesen, nine

The
 Norwegian girl was waiting at a bus shelter for a downpour to end when 
he pulled her down a slope and bashed her head against a rock. he later 
told how disappointed he was that she was not a boy. He said her last 
words were: 'Mummy, mummy'. He then dismembered and buried her, returning
 a year later to burn the remains. Police later found a bone fragment 
that matched that of a young girl that appeared to have been cut by a 
sharp instrument in the spot he identified.

It was there, during a series of therapy sessions which he says were so uninteresting that he felt a failure even at that, that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take notice of him.

He told GQ magazine in an interview last August how when he said his heavily-pregnant mother had walked in on his father sexually abusing him at the age of ten, the therapist's interest sparked up.

Such was the shock at what his mother had seen, he claimed, that she miscarried the baby onto the bedroom floor.

He told how the next day his father took him to bury the dead foetus in nearby woodland. As the therapist listened intently to his tale, for the first time he felt important.

And within weeks he was telling staff he was behind one of Sweden's most famous unsolved murders - that of 11-year-old Johan Asplund whose torso alone was found in 1980.

As the months drew on he confessed to a host of other murders including that of a 15-year-old boy in 1976; a 17-year-old girl in 1981; Dutch husband and wife in 1984; a 23-year-old female prostitute in 1985; and an Israeli student and a 9-year-old Norwegian girl in 1988.

Of those eight murders he was convicted, despite claims of a lack of real evidence.

Retrials were ordered in each case, but prosecutors said that without the confessions they didn't have enough evidence to go back to court.

Last July they dropped the final case, which involved the death of 15-year-old boy who disappeared in northern Sweden in 1976.

Bergwall was convicted in 1994 of murdering the boy, even though there was no technical evidence linking him to the crime and the cause of death could not be established.

The lack of evidence to support the confessions led to some doubts over Bergwall's guilt, but a 2006 review by Sweden's chancellor of justice found no problems with the convictions.

Two years later Bergwall recanted in a Swedish TV documentary, saying he had fabricated the story of Thomas Quick the serial killer. He now claims it was a cry for attention, fuelled by heavy medication.

Sven-Erik Alhem, a Swedish legal expert who was not involved with the case, last year called it the country’s 'greatest miscarriage of justice in modern times.'

He said it was particularly painful for the families of the victims, who are unlikely to ever find out the truth of what happened to their loved ones.

With Bergwall's confessions withdrawn, there are no longer any strong links between the eight deaths, and it is not even clear that all were homicides. In two cases no bodies were found.
