Wealthy socialite Sheila von Weise Mack had a blazing row with her daughter and the teenager's boyfriend over a hotel bill hours before her body was found crammed into a blood-stained suitcase on the holiday island of Bali.

Witnesses have told police that Mrs Mack, her 19-year-old daughter Heather and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, had a row at the reception desk of the luxury St Regis Hotel on Wednesday morning before her body was shuffled from the hotel in a silver suitcase.

Staff have told police that the three argued about who should pay the bill when they were due to check out on Thursday.

Suspect: Heather Mack at the police HQ in Bali. Hotel staff have told MailOnline how she and her boyfriend were arguing over the bill in the lobby the night before Sheila von Weise Mack's body was found stuffed in a suitcase

Uncooperative: Heather has been refusing to talk to police and has been demanding that she has a U.S. lawyer

Confrontation: The teenager and her mother pictured on one of their many exotic holidays. The night before her death witnesses said she told her daughter angrily: 'I paid for his (the boyfriend's flight), you pay the hotel bill'

According 
to a staff reconstruction of the argument, Mrs Mack, from Chicago, was seen pointing at
 Mr Schaefer, who had checked in after the couple earlier in the week, 
and telling her daughter:'I’ve paid for his flight here, so the two of you should pay for the hotel.'

The
 three of them left the lobby area after the row but a few hours later, 
at 11.26am, Ms Mack and Mr Schaefer arrived in the reception area with a
 large suitcase wrapped in a bed sheet, refusing to allow a porter to 
take it out to a waiting taxi.

The 'body in the suitcase' murder is a story spiced with tragedy, involving
 a troubled young woman, Mr Schaefer, whose previous girlfriend was 
killed in a car crash in South Africa in April, and a wealthy widow who 
met a grisly death in a tropical paradise.

Staff
 at the $650 St Regis hotel told of the strange behaviour of Miss Mack, 
who would instantly change from being friendly with them to storming 
around the opulent lobby and the pool area in an aggressive manner and 
glaring angrily at those who approached her.

Police
 sources in the Bali capital, Denpasar, said that both Mr Schaefer and 
Ms Mack were being questioned but the couple are refusing to 
co-operate and are demanding a lawyer from the US.

Witnesses
 reported that she and her mother were seen arguing on a number of 
occasions at the hotel, causing some staff to be concerned that the 
couple might even come to blows.

'The
 mother had all the appearances of one of our upmarket guests,' said a 
staff member, 'but the behaviour she and her daughter showed did not 
belong in our hotel. Even so, it’s such a tragic end for that poor 
woman.'

Held:
 Schaefer is escorted by a policeman for questioning in connection with 
the murder. He sent a Facebook message some days before his trip hinting
 that he may never return from Indonesia

Lovebirds: The couple started dating after the tragic death of Schaefer's girlfriend in a car crash in April

After
 carrying the suitcase containing Mrs Mack’s body out to the taxi, Ms 
Mack and Mr Schaefer  returned to the reception desk and said they 
would not be paying the bill - it would be taken care of by Mrs Mack 
when she checked out later.

But
 it is claimed they did ask for a safety deposit box, believed to 
contain Mrs Mack’s jewellery and their passports, to be opened and its 
contents given to them. The staff refused because they said Mrs Mack had
 left instructions that only she should be allowed to open it.

Ms
 Mack and Mr Schaefer said they had more bags to collect - but instead 
they went out through the back entrance and later ordered another taxi 
to take them to the airport.

Denpasar police chief Djoko Hariutomo said they approached immigration officials claiming they had lost their passports.

'They
 said the needed to get new passports in order to leave the country, but
 that was because the passports were locked inside the deposit box at 
the hotel,' said Mr Djoko.

After
 being told by immigration officials that lost passports had to be 
reported to respective embassies, the couple vanished again, this time 
taking a taxi to the four star Risata Bali Resort, a short distance from
 the airport.

With
 an alert going out to all hotels and taxis, police received a call from
 staff at the Risata where, raiding a room at 8.30am on Wednesday, 
police found the couple asleep and arrested them.

As
 police began the difficult task of trying to question the pair in 
detail, fingerprint experts were examining pieces of glass from an 
unidentified object that is believed to have been used to bludgeon Mrs 
Mack in room 616 in the hope of finding clues as to whether it was Ms 
Mack or Mr Schaefer who had last touched the suspected murder weapon.

While
 suspicion remains on both young people, as they were the only ones seen
 entering the room on CCTV footage, police said their initial inquiries 
suggested the perpetrator of the crime was the daughter.

Rages:
 At the $650 St Regis hotel staff told of the strange behaviour of 
Heather, who would instantly change from being friendly with them to 
storming around the opulent lobby and the pool area in an aggressive 
manner and glaring angrily at those who approached her

They
 have both been subjected to blood and urine tests to check if the pair 
were on drugs, but officers said psychological tests and Ms Mack’s 
behaviour suggested she was 'unpredictable'.

In
 a bizarre twist, the couple, who are being interviewed separately, have
 told police that Mrs Mack had been killed by an armed gang who had then
 taken the two of them captive before they were able to escape.

'They
 have both told the same story about the armed gang, but clearly this is
 something they have concocted before their arrest, as there is 
absolutely no evidence from the CCTV cameras to show they were captured 
by a gang,' police said.

From
 both the US and Indonesia, reports have emerged telling of Mrs Mack’s 
troubled daughter, who is understood to have been adopted.

An
 insight into the family background and Ms Mack’s psychological problems
 has come from a writer to the Jakarta Post who said she was the same 
age as Heather, having been friends with her for years.

'Heather
 has always been a very disturbed girl.
 She was extremely spoiled and would often scream and throw things until
 she got her way,' the writer said.

'In
 2006, Sheila and her husband were vacationing on a cruise ship when 
something went wrong and her husband cut his foot due to negligence. 
Sheila sued the cruise ship and won a sizeable amount of money.

'Heather became even crazier with the newly-inherited millions.'

The
 former friend added: 'I have absolutely no idea what Tommy saw in 
Heather or what would bring him to' - allegedly - 'participate in the 
murder'.

'Tommy
 recently lost the love of his life. In April, Tommy’s long-time 
girlfriend, Rachel Smylie, passed away in a car accident in Cape Town, 
South Africa.

'I guess Tommy and Heather started dating after Rachel’s death and I’m saddened that he got caught up in Heather’s insanity. Sheila was an incredibly nice, educated woman.

Horror:
 The blood-stained suitcase where the body of Mrs von Wiese-Mack was 
found. It was left in a cab when Mack and Schaefer checked out of the 
hotel, but they failed to return and the driver went to police

'She
 was always dressed to the 9s, even while running errands. If I close my
 eyes and try to visualise her, an image of Sheiila wearing a fur coat 
and stiletto heels while shopping at the local Jewel-Osco comes to 
mind.'

Ms
 Mack appears to have caused numerous problems for her mother and police
 in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, where the Mack family lived for a 
number of years.

Between 2004 and 2013 had resulted to officers responding to 86 calls from the Mack home.

Even
 before the Bali trip there was added conflict when Mrs Mack told police
 that her credit card was being used on July 23 without her permission 
at the Conrad Hotel in Chicago, according to the Chicago Tribune.

When
 officers arrived, they learned that Ms Mack and Mr Schaefer had used 
the credit card to book a room and ring up almost $1000 in charges.

Shortly
 before he flew to Bali, Mr Schaefer had told friends in a cryptic 
Facebook message that he was going too Indonesia and 'wasn’t sure' when 
he was coming back, before planning to go on to China.
