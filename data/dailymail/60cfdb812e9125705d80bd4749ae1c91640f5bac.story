Disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile was given a key position running Broadmoor and personally selected managers, it was claimed last night.

A former manager claimed that politicians and civil servants thought he was the ‘bee’s knees’ and appointed him to a task force to run the hospital in 1988.

The Top Of The Pops presenter has since been unmasked as one of Britain’s most prolific sex offenders, but was ‘given the keys’ to Broadmoor.

Savile had had a long association with the hospital, having been a volunteer worker there in the 1970s and 1980s with the unofficial title ‘honorary entertainments officer’.

He had his own set of keys and living quarters on site and is accused of sexually abusing a number of patients.

It is now claimed that he had a far bigger role than previously thought and was able to choose managers to run the hospital.

He is also said to have been put in charge of a committee which examined the welfare of patients, even though the new management were given no say in his appointment.

A manager who had close links to Broadmoor told a newspaper: ‘Savile was a national entertainer and was in charge of this psychiatric unit. I thought it was extraordinary, but the civil servants and the politicians apparently thought he was the bee’s knees.’

A female civil servant at the health department had complained to her boss that Savile had kissed her on the mouth before a meeting with Edwina Currie yet nothing was done.

He was appointed by Mrs Currie, then a junior health minister, despite the fact he had no expertise in mental health.

The Broadmoor taskforce, which replaced the previous suspended management, was set up in August 1988.

The Earl of Dundee told the House of Lords that Savile was ‘devoting his considerable talents to ensuring that the hospital functions smoothly’.

Alan Franey, a taskforce member and later Broadmoor’s general manager, said: ‘Savile was appointed to the task force by Edwina Currie, but it would have been on the recommendation of civil servants. It was a bit odd.’

Cliff Graham, under-secretary at the Department of Health and an advocate for NHS change, recommended that Savile sit on the taskforce.

Former Broadmoor staff recall being called to meetings with the DJ.

Mr Franey said: ‘I had an unusual meeting in the Athenaeum Club in London [Jimmy Savile and Cliff Graham were present]... and I was persuaded that a move to Broadmoor would be a good career step.’

The late David Edmond, the first chairman of the Special Hospitals Service Authority (SHSA), recalled: ‘I [was] asked to a strange meeting at Stoke Mandeville Hospital with Cliff Graham, Jimmy Savile, a retired Department of Health senior civil servant and other department officials...’

One manager at the hospital reflected on Savile’s influence: ‘We were told that he was a valuable asset, that he was well thought of in high circles in the Department of Health and it was important we got on good terms and that we cultivated what he had to offer.

‘Cliff Graham quite explicitly told me those things and said much the same to David Edmond.’

Mr Franey added that Mr Graham was in favour of Savile. He said: ‘Savile’s connections were significant. Everyone knew of the close friendship between Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, and Savile, whom she regularly invited to Chequers.’

There is no suggestion that Mr Franey or any of the civil servants and politicians had any knowledge of Savile’s abuse.

Staff at the hospital said they reported issues to management, but nothing was done.

Richard Harrison, a psychiatric nurse at Broadmoor for 30 years, said of Savile’s appointment: ‘The lunatics have taken over the asylum.’

He added: ‘I considered him, as many of my colleagues did, as a man with a severe personality disorder and a liking for children.’

Bob Allen, a former nurse, said he saw Savile take a girl who looked 14 or 15 years old into his house.

When he reported it, his supervisor said: ‘No one appears to be interested.’

Last night, Broadmoor did not respond to requests for a comment.
