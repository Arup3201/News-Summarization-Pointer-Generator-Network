According to a new report, Russian computer hackers managed to sneak a 'digital bomb' into the Nasdaq's computer system that is capable of sabotaging stock market computers and derail the U.S. economy.

In the report, published by Bloomberg Businessweek, the 'cybergrenade' was never set off.

The publication claims that hackers managed to slip into the Nasdaq's computer network in 2010 by using malware capable of spying and stealing data.

The malware could also cause 'digital destruction.'

Federal officials still aren't entirely sure who was responsible for the breach. Bloomberg's report, however, points the finger at the Russian government

In response to the report, Russian officials called the claims 'pure nonsense.'

FBI’s New York Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos said in a statement to CNNMoney that the FBI is still investigating the break in.

People familiar with the investigation tell Bloomberg that the person responsible is likely Russian hacker Aleksandr Kalinin.

Safe: Nasdaq is assuring customers that the hackers were unsuccessful and the 'digital bomb' never went off

Federal authorities say they caught him trying to hack Nasdaq computers between 2007 and 2010.

'The events of four years ago, while sensationalized by Businessweek, 
only confirmed what we have said historically: that none of Nasdaq’s 
trading platforms or engines were ever compromised, and no evidence of 
exfiltration exists from directors’ desks,' Ryan Wells, a company 
spokesperson, said in an effort to convince Nasdaq clients that their information is secure.
