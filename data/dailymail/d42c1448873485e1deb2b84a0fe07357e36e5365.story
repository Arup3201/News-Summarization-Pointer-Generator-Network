Poison victim: Linda McDonagh, 60, died after her saline drip was poisoned at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport

Police have named two more suspected victims of the hospital insulin poisoner.

John Beeley, 73, died on Friday and grandmother Linda McDonagh, 60, died earlier this month.

They are two of 21 patients thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 – which care for seriously ill patients – between June 1 and July 15 last year.

Mrs McDonagh, who had a serious motor neurone disease, was treated at the site last summer.

The former office administrator at an NHS clinic was diagnosed two-and-a-half years ago and her condition had been getting progressively worse.

She was being treated for pneumonia last summer when her blood sugar levels 'dropped dramatically', according to her devastated husband Stewart.

He said doctors removed her saline drip and replaced it with another which 'brought her back' and she recovered 'within minutes'.

After surviving the visit, she had a relapse and was back in Stepping Hill on January 7 with another bout of pneumonia. She was put on a 'non-invasive ventilator' but later decided to remove the mask and died on January 14.

Mrs McDonagh lived with her car mechanic husband in Offerton, Stockport. They have two daughters and a son as well as two grandchildren.

'She was the best mother anybody could ever wish for,' said her daughter Amanda Thorley.

Police are investigating whether insulin poisoning was a factor in Mrs McDonagh's death.

The coroner's office have been informed and tests are due to be carried out.

Arrested: Victorino Chua, 46, who was held in connection with the murder of three patients

Officers are continuing to probe the 
deaths of multiple sclerosis sufferer Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold 
Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, and Bill Dickson, 82, a former senior Daily 
Mail journalist, who all died after suffering ‘hypoglycaemic episodes’ –
a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels.

A saboteur is believed to have spiked saline solution with insulin at the hospital.

The alarm was
first raised by hospital staff on July 12 when a higher than normal 
number of patients were reported to have 'unexplained' low blood sugar 
levels.

However, police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluids at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport.

Earlier this month male nurse Victorino Chua, 46, was arrested in connection with the murder of three patients – Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83. He was bailed until April.

He was also arrested on suspicion of 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Fellow nurse Rebecca Leighton, 28, spent six weeks in jail following her arrest in the investigation.

She was released and cleared of any wrongdoing last September when prosecutors said there was not enough evidence against her.

Victim: Bill Dickson, a former Daily Mail journalist, who died after suffering a 'hypoglycaemic episode'

Announcing the latest death, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said today: 'The woman, who was one of a number of patients who police believe suffered hypoglycaemic episodes between June and July 2011 after being administered contaminated products at Stepping Hill Hospital, died in the early hours of Saturday 14 January.

'The coroner has been made aware and further tests are ongoing.'

The family of Mrs McDonagh, from Offerton, Stockport, have said they do not wish to comment.

Police chiefs have previously stressed that detectives have not yet established the degree to which deliberate contamination of products may have contributed to the patients' deaths.

They added that about 650 people have already been spoken to by officers since the contamination was discovered when nursing staff raised the alarm.
