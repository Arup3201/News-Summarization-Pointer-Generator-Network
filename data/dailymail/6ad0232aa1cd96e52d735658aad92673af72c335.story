Real Madrid legend Jorge Valdano has launched a scathing attack on Jose Mourinho, saying the Chelsea manager has an 'ego' and has never said anything about football 'worth remembering'.

The former Real director, who clashed with Mourinho during his time in charge at the Bernabeu, also claimed the 'Special One' was vastly inferior to Pep Guardiola.

Writing in his new book 'The 11 Powers of a League', Argentine World Cup winner Valdano said: 'Mourinho is a figure who is perfectly suited to these bombastic, shallow times.

'I couldn't understand him because he is the antithesis of my sensitivity. Intelligence and ego are enemies and when they collide, the ego wins.

'I've never heard him say a single thing about football worth remembering, whether in public or in private.'

Valdano, who played for Real in the eighties and managed them for two years in the nineties, was sacked from his director general post in May 2011 after his relationship with Mourinho hit rock bottom.

Comparing Mourinho to Guardiola, Valdano said: 'If Guardiola is Mozart, that makes Mourinho [Italian composer Antonio] Salieri. He would have been a great musician if Mozart had never existed.'

While Guardiola delivered the Champions League twice in three years for Barcelona, Mourinho failed to reach the semi-finals of the competition during his time at the club.

In an interview to promote his book, Valdano added: 'He had one of the best squads in the history of Real Madrid.

'He always remained just outside the door of the Champions League. That was the big challenge which he did not manage to succeed at.'
