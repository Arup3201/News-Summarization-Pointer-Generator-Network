A DJ has been jailed for attacking his girlfriend after she confronted him about his persistent womanising.

Malachi Halstead was in a relationship with several women at once, sparking a row with his partner Samantha Bowden.

During the fight, the 33-year-old kicked her between her legs, leading her to require hospital treatment.

Trouble: Newport Crown Court heard that Halstead is so 'likeable' that he cannot avoid flirting

Newport Crown Court heard that Halstead, who DJs under the names 'Madman' and 'Madskie', admits that 'fidelity is not his strongest quality'.

Photographs of him on nights out which have been posted on Facebook show him posing for dozens of photographs with different young women.

However, his lawyer defended him by saying he was so 'affable and likeable' that he could not avoid attention from women, comparing him to the playboy film character Alfie played by Michael Caine and Jude Law.

Halstead was sentenced to two and a half years in prison over the attack on Miss Bowden, 26, in July last year.

The assault took place at her home in Newport, South Wales.

In court, the father of one claimed to be a 'gentleman' who nonetheless had a number of relationships with different women at the same time.

David Leathley, defending him, said: 'Mr Halstead and his background is very much like Michael Caine's Alfie.

'He was seeing a lot of women, he likes women and women like him. He conceded that fidelity is not his strongest quality.

'He's an affable gentleman adored by women and that's his problem. A more congenial, sociable individual one could not hope to meet.

'His affability and likeability has made him an attractive man to women.'

Prosecutor Byron Broadstock said: 'Halstead kicked Miss Bowden between the legs during a disagreement.

'Miss Bowden said the pain was such like she had never felt before.'

Convictions: Halstead has previously spent time in jail for robbery, blackmail and kidnap

Attack: The injuries he inflicted were so bad that his girlfriend had to go to hospital

Criminal: Halstead's latest crimes included assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving

Halstead pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm, and was convicted of a separate charge of dangerous driving.

The DJ, who has the word 'Madman' tattooed across his back, has previously been spent time in jail for a variety of offences.

He has been convicted of dozens of crimes, including kidnap, blackmail, robbery and stealing cars.
