The mega-fight for which the world has been waiting what seems like an eternity may finally happen not just once, but twice.

Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather is tantalisingly close to becoming reality after the PacMan’s dazzling, rejuvenated performance here in Macau.

The target date is May and if Pacquiao were to win the scene would be set for them to do it again next September.

Floyd Mayweather could demand a re-match with Pacquiao should he lose the first proposed bout

Mayweather is believed to be demanding a re-match clause in the contract if he succumbs to the mounting pressure to fight Pacquiao and then loses.

That was revealed by Pacquiao’s iconic trainer, Freddie Roach, as he reviewed the prospects for a Mayweather fight before flying back from China to Los Angeles.

Roach told me: ‘My understanding is that Floyd is insisting on the re-match if Manny beats him, which I believe he will. That’s okay with us.’

And why not, given the huge amount of money which would be involved?

The original projection of boxing’s first $300 million fight will soar to one billion dollars if Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum succeeds in opening up the vast Chinese television market to pay-per-view.

That would make for not just one but two Billion Dollar Fights if his PacMan beats Mayweather the Money man first time out.

Pacquiao put the heat back on Mayweather after decking Chris Algieri no fewer than six times on his way to victory by a record 18 points in the Cotai Arena.

That was compiled by his winning of all 12 rounds and the American having half a dozen points deducted for those knock-downs.

Job done, world welterweight title retained, Pacuaio then called out Mayweather for the first time, saying: ‘I want this fight and it is time now to give it to all our fans. They deserve to see it.’

One by one the several obstacles raised by Mayweather have been removed, including Pacquiao agreeing to random blood tests for drugs and accepting a 60-40 financial split in favour of his rival for the mythical title of greatest pound-for-pound boxer in the world.

Arum, having said that the fight needs to happen if boxing wants to be regarded as a major sport, adds: ‘Enough is enough. Let’s do this. All it needs now is for them to make the call. Me and Manny are waiting to pick up the phone.’

Arum is working also on the rivalry between the two major US cable television networks, HBO who screen Pacquiao’s fights and Showtime who have two fights left on their mega-bucks contract with Mayweather.

He is reported to be in talks with CBS, Showtime’s parent company, about them sharing the pay-per-view broadcast in America with HBO, the way they did with Mike Tyson versus Lennox Lewis.

That puts the ball in Mayweather’s court.

As Roach says: ‘Floyd is afraid of losing his unbeaten record to Manny. But that’s not what defines greatness. Ali lost, Robinson, lost Leonard lost….but they’re still all-time greats. What counts is fighting the best of your era.’

Correct.

It would have been preferable for these two to meet five or six years ago, in their prime, But although Mayweather is 37 and Pacquiao coming up 36 next month, there is still time for the fight, or fights, to be meaningful.

Both men live clean, eat healthy and adhere to rigorous training regimes. Given the remarkable physical conditioning made possible by those disciplines, they are still the greatest fighters of their age.

Manny’s waiting. Come on Floyd. Let’s get it on.

Pacquiao shows his softer side after Algieri demolition 

Manny Pacquiao will dip into his £20million-plus purse for turning Algieri into a human yo-yo to fund the education of three hundred under-privileged kids in the poor district of the Philippines which he represents as a Congressman.

He is paying the school fees as well providing the computers and other equipment.

Floyd Mayweather has used a portion of the $40 million he received for September’s repeat victory over Marcos Maidana for his latest glitzy extravagance, the purchase of a gold-plated Bentley golf buggy for his son’s birthday.

They are both great fighters but there is one thing Money can’t buy.

Class.

Froch set for a final fling in Las Vegas?  

Carl Froch’s hopes of ending a stellar ring career with his first fight in the glamorous boxing Mecca of Las Vegas are still alive.

Negotiations for him to defend his world super-middleweight titles there against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr seemed to have stalled on a contract dispute between the son of the Mexican legend and his promoter Bob Arum.

However, before flying back to Vegas from his successful staging of Manny Pacquiao’s latest victory in Macau, Arum said: ‘Although Chavez wants to move on, we have one fight left on our contract with him.

‘Now he tells us he wants the fight with Froch so if he bites the bullet with us it will happen.’

The delay is expected to push the proposed date of January 31 back to late February or early March.

By then the IBF may strip him of their belt for failing to give fellow Brit James DeGale a mandatory defence, even though he has been an exemplary, high-profile champion for that body.

But that would still leave his WBA title at stake and Froch will not be railroaded into another domestic scrap, the way he was for two successive mandatories against George Groves.
