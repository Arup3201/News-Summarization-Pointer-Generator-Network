A devastating rainstorm that claimed 37 lives in Beijing over the weekend has raised serious concerns over the Chinese capital's ability to cope with flooding.

Beijing was hit with the heaviest downpour seen in the city in 60 years on Saturday, with many roads submerged under waist-deep water for hours.

The death toll had reached 37 by Sunday night according to the municipal government, after 25 people drowned, six were killed in cave-ins in houses, five were electrocuted and one was killed by lightening.

Deluge: Non-stop rain saw roads turned into rivers in the city, with parts submerged in up to 17 feet of water

Chaos: Cars can be seen floating in floodwaters surrounding a residential building in Beijing, following fierce rainstorms over the weekend

The rain and flooding caused blackouts and road closures across the city. The Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Expressway was still yet to reopen on Monday as part of it remained submerged.

The disaster affected 1.9 million people and caused almost 10 billion yuan (almost Â£1 billion) of damages, according to state news agency Xinhua. The exact economic loss is still being verified by local governmental departments, according to Beijing flood control and drought relief headquarters.

Government officials faced criticism as local people took to the internet to criticise the city's inadequate drainage systems.

'The situation of the sewers reflects the real quality of the city's infrastructure,' one user called Brother Zhang Xiaohua posted on popular micro-blogging site Sina Weibo.

Another going by the name of 'Musibo' wrote: 'China has been investing heavily in construction in recent years, and the glossy appearance of the cities is eye-catching.

'However, the huge loss from the rainstorm in Beijing has exposed the flaws of the city's infrastructure, which should raise an alarm for the policy makers.'

Scenes such as those witnessed in Beijing across the weekend are becoming an all too familiar sight in China this summer, with rainstorms and flooding wreaking havoc in cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongquing and Shenzhen.

Experts believe the floods are largely down to urbanisation, with vast networks of roads and the elimination of greenbelts reducing some cities' ability to cope with heavy rainfall.

Wang Hao, from the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, said more than 80 per cent of Beijing's roads are covered in impermeable materials like concrete and asphalt - which prevent the infiltration of rain water.

But an investigation led by Li Haiyan, a professor at the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, about half of the city's drainage networks are filled with sediments - with some layers as thick as ten to 15 per cent of the pipes' diameter.

Sheng Minzhi, an engineer at the Hangzhou Planning Bureau, said the mass construction of tall buildings and underground parking lots in some Chinese cities had also slowed the rate at which rainwater is absorbed into the ground.

Wang Yi, from Beijing's flood control and drought relief headquarters, said the drainage systems in the city's downtown area are for the most part build to withstand rainfall of between 36 and 45 millimetres per hour.

Only a few places, such as Tiananmen Square, have a more robust system that can withstand 56 millimetres of rainfall per hour.

Wang Zhansheng, an environmental and engineering professor at Tsinghua University, said the flooding would not be so severe if drainage systems were designed to handle more severe rainfalls, adding that the flooding could be avoided if regulations governing urban drainage took population growth, water usage and sewage treatment into consideration.

Xu Chenghua, an engineer at the Hangzhou Urban Planning Academy, said storm drainage systems are supposed to be designed in accordance with the Urban Drainage Engineering Planning Regulations approved by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development in 2000.

A central government group responsible for drafting regulations related to urban drainage engineering gathered on May 18 to discuss the problem of urban flooding. New regulations are expected to be launched next year, according to a source with the group.

But experts have pointed out that the reconstruction of the drainage systems would be a very expensive and difficult undertaking.

Since the lay-out and the functional structure of the cities are already in shape, renewing the drainage systems to bring them up to the level of developed countries would be hugely costly, according to Wang Hao at the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

Experts have urged the government to launch a uniform urban flooding drainage standard to guide the urban planning of Chinese cities, Xinhua said.
