Flexing its financial might, the political machine backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch on Monday told its allies that spending in the 2016 election cyle would hit $889 million across its conservative network.

Three major news outlets – The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Associated Press – reported the 'leaked' figure almost simultaneously on Tuesday morning, along with the Virginia political newspaper Politico, suggesting the uber-wealthy brothers want that gargantuan number out there.

The Kochs would put only a small amount of that money on the table themselves: They have patiently cultivated a hush-hush collection of about 450 moneyed conservatives who are expected to carry equal shares of the load.

The brothers' Koch Industries produces everything from Dixie cups and toilet paper to jet fuel and fertilizer. They're personally tied for fourth place on Forbes magazine's list of the wealthiest Americans, with assets estimated at $41.5 billion each.

But in the pantheon of individual political donors, the Kochs are nowhere near the top: They were tied for 24th place, at $2 million apiece, among donors to outside spending groups in the 2014 elections. Liberal climate-change hawk Tom Steyer outdistanced the field with more than $73 million.

Charles Koch (shown in 2007) is at the head of Koch Industries and runs the company with an eye toward giving 100,000 a say in management and reinvesting 90 per cent of profits instead of pulling money out

In conservative circles, though, they're without equal in their willingness to organize other wealthy donors to defend the ideal of a limited federal government. 

That's a value their father Fred instilled in them after he spent the earliest part of his career building oil refineries in the Soviet Union and became enraged by what he saw as the evils of communism. 

The net result is an $889 million political budget planned by Freedom Partners, the secretive chamber-of-commerce-type group that hosted four potential Republican presidential candidates at its weekend meetings in Palm Springs, California.

That amount would dwarf expected spending from official GOP committees and many major presidential candidates.

In the 2012 election, the last time Americans elected a president, the Republican National Committee and the party’s two campaign committees covering congressional races spent a combined total of $657 million. 

News of the hefty budget also suggests that the Koch-backed groups are prepared to spend heavily and early to weaken the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Koch-backed groups such as Americans for Prosperity aired tens of millions of dollars in negative ads against incumbent Democratic lawmakers in 2014 and helped Republicans win a majority in the Senate.

While the Koch-backed groups are tremendously effective, even some of their allies eyed the latest budget figure with wariness.

Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican who now heads the American Bankers Association and who calls the Kochs 'wonderful human beings,' lamented the ballooning role of outside groups in politics during an Associated Press interview.

'This is the new normal,' Keating said.

And fierce political enemies of Charles Koch, 79, and David Koch, 74, pounced.

Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee told Politico sarcastically: 'Wait, you mean a bunch of billionaires are going to spend nearly $1 billion in pocket change to try to buy a president to rig the system for them and give them massive tax breaks that no one else gets? I'm shocked!'

Ben Ray, a spokesman for the liberal American Bridge 21st Century, a PAC linked to the controversial group Media Matters for America, told the AP that the Kochs will 'stop at nothing to purchase a government that grows their profits, weakens pollution standards and maintains tax breaks for big oil.'

But spending is not a guarantee of success. Veteran GOP operative John Feehery said the massive investment would have little impact if Republicans lack quality candidates.

'None of the spending will make a difference unless we have a credible candidate who can effectively lead the country,' Feehery said. 

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a hard-charging Republican, told the Palm Springs gathering that 'there are a bunch of Democrats who have taken as their talking point that the Koch brothers are the nexus of all evil in the world. Harry Reid says that every week.'

'Let me be very clear, I think that is grotesque and offensive.'

'I admire Charles and David Koch,' Cruz said. 'They are businessman who have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and they have stood up for free-market principles and endured vilification with equanimity and grace.'

On the surface, Koch Industries appears to embrace values that liberals would applaud.

The elder brother has trademarked the phrase 'Market-Based Management,' a philosophy that he applies to business. It calls for giving its 100,000 employees a bigger voice in decision-making, and demands that the company reinvests 90 percent of its earnings instead of pulling profits out for shareholders.

The net result for the Wichita, Kansas company they inherited from their father is the second-largest privately held company in the nation.

And David Koch in particular is a philanthropist of the first rank. He personally gave $100 million to build a theatre at Lincoln Center in New York City, $65 milion for a plaza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and $100 million for an ambulatory care center at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

But all their spending on conservative and libertarian groups has turned the Kochs into the men liberals most love to hate.

'It's no wonder the candidates show up when the Koch brothers call,' former Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod told the Times. 'That's exponentially more money than any party organization will spend. In many ways, they have superseded the party.'

Charles Koch thanked his group's members on Saturday night for helping Republicans win a congressional landslide in November, an event he reportedly called 'an important step in slowing down the march toward collectivism.'  

Freedom Partners founded a super PAC in 2014, giving the brothers a critical tool to run openly partisan political ads. The trade-off was a rare bit of transparency.

The super PAC spent $25 million on the elections, of which trusts controlled by the brothers contributed about $4 million. 

Freedom Partners is the central hub for the Koch-backed network that includes groups like the activist-recruiting Americans for Prosperity, the millennial-targeting Generation Opportunity and the Hispanic-wooing Libre Initiative. 

But unlike political parties covered by strict campaign finance laws, the Koch collection of organizations is mostly made up of nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors.

Democrats have heavily criticized the Kochs' spending in politics and lack of transparency. A Washington Post-Center for Responsive Politics analysis of the Koch-linked network found $407 million in spending during 2012's elections.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul appeared at the weekend Freedom Partners gathering in California, trying to sell donors on his libertarian brand of noninterventionist foreign policy with an eye toward 2016

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told the Koch-backed gathering that  Hollywood and left-leaning media outlets exert influence over politics that's at least equal to what the Kochs can muster 

Freedom Partners' twice-as-large 2016 budget was included in a Monday briefing that Freedom Partners officials offered a record 450 allies and donors who huddled in Palm Springs.

Two people familiar with the budget disclosed the sum on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans.

Charles and David Koch typically end their twice-a-year summits with company advisers urging likeminded donors to pledge to open their checkbooks and support their campaigns.

The events offer donors access to  top lawmakers as well. For instance, likely presidential contenders Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida appeared together for a policy discussion. Another likely candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, also was on hand.

Rubio was asked by ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl, the forum's moderator, whether there is 'too much influence in politics by super wealthy donors on both sides.'

'As opposed to Hollywood or the mainstream media, you mean, or other multi-million dollar entities that try to influence American politics every day?' Rubio asked.

The crowd went wild.
