These are the stunning landscapes captured by a photographer who returned home to expose the beauty of Great Britain in autumn.

Travelling across Britain, photographer Julian Elliott, originally from Salisbury, began his adventure in the middle of September and finished it this month.

It required plenty of patience as a great deal of his time was spent watching the weather and waiting for clear skies.

He captured incredible scenes in Dorset, Dartmoor, Devon, Sussex, Wiltshire, Scottish Highlands, Peak District National Park, Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia and the Yorkshire Dales.

The 39-year-old photographer, now of Tours, France, said: ‘In some cases, the images were difficult to get. The weather is very fickle, as anyone who lives in the UK knows.

‘I had originally planned to capture the autumn colour across Britain during early November, but during a visit in mid-September it was obvious that autumn had arrived early in some place, with the leaves already changing.’

After moving to France four years ago, the natural beauty of Britain has remained close to Julian's heart.

Mr Elliott spent a lot of time waiting for clear skies as he visited places such as the Sgwd Gwladus waterfall in the Brecon Beacons, Wales

He said: ‘I used to visit Snowdonia every year with my grandparents; to see it again through the eyes of adult was great and it's somewhere I want to go back to.

‘Outside of this, the Galloway Forest was also a highlight. It seems to be one of those places where you can spend a whole day and not see anyone.’

He decided to pursue a career in landscape photography because of his love of the outdoors.

He said: ‘Everyone that I talk to about my work has always been very positive.

‘You do of course get opinions about what you should and shouldn't have done but that's always going to be the case.

‘I think there are a lot of people who like my work as I try to keep it as natural looking as possible instead of adding all sorts of digital filters over the image.'

Mr Elliott's journey across Britain took him to this incredible landscape at Loch Garry in the Highlands of Scotland

Julian added: ‘My message would be for people to appreciate more of what is around them.

‘Not living in the country anymore I'm not always in the position where I can jump in the car to get images of these beautiful places.

‘British people are lucky as they are never that far from beautiful scenery.’
