This hilarious footage taken on a camera phone captures one man's battle with a highchair as he struggles to get out after becoming trapped.

The man, identified only as Darren, begs, squirms and even takes off his jeans as he fights to get out of the chair - which he chose to get into - while out with friends at a pub, thought to be in Cambridge.

The video, uploaded to Facebook by one of his friends on Thursday, shows Darren becoming increasingly desperate as his friends laugh at his attempts to escape.

Trapped: Darren's friends start by trying to lift him out of the wooden highchair, left, which he became stuck in after climbing in as a joke, but later leave Darren to scramble on the floor as he tries to pull himself free

After realising Darren is stuck, one of his friends tries to haul him out of the chair by grabbing him under the arms - while another pulls on the wooden tray attached.

When that doesn't work the two men tilt the chair towards the ground - as Darren groans in pain - hoping that the new angle might make it easier to pull him free.

His friends burst into laughter when Darren once again can't get out and continue laughing as he starts wriggling desperately in his chair - his face becoming increasingly panicked.

A third friend gets involved in the rescue mission as they try once more to pull Darren out, but they all step back when nothing can be done.

Darren is seen shuffling around the floor while pushing the chair away from his body before leaning forwards on all fours - the chair resting around his waist.

Desperate: At one point in the video, Darren begs his friends to pull him out, left. Finally, at the suggestion of one of his friends, Darren takes of his trousers in a last-ditch attempt to wriggle free

At this, laughter erupts from the other patrons and his friend John Henshaw, who filmed the video, turns his phone to show customers on the other side of the pub sharing in the joke.

One of his friends, after pointing out that Darren 'got himself in there', suggests that he takes off his jeans and Darren, in a last-ditch attempt, decides to give it a go.

The video cuts out after his friends suggest calling emergency services and Darren asks the bartender for a saw.

It is not known how he was finally freed from the chair.
