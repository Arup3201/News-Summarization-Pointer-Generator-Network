Scars: Yoselyn Ortega, the nanny who is accused of killing Lucia and Leo Krim, appeared at a hearing for her trial at Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday with her self-inflicted wounds visible

A nanny accused of brutally stabbing two children to death in the bathtub of their luxurious Manhattan home returned to court today after being ruled fit to stand trial for murder.

Yoselyn Ortega, 50, wore her dark hair tied back in a braid for the brief hearing at Manhattan Supreme Court and her self-inflicted stab wound on her neck was clearly visible.

The scar shows where the nanny attempted to slit her own throat on October 25 after Marina Krim came home to her Upper West Side apartment to find her daughter Lucia, six, and her son, Leo, two, dead in a pool of blood in the bath.

The short appearance comes after Ortega was examined by two mental health professionals, both of whom found that she could assist in her defense in a meaningful way and that she was mentally fit to proceed to her trial. Her lawyer is challenging those results.

Last month, Ortega claimed someone else killed the children she's accused of stabbing all over their bodies in the Krims home.

'I didn't do that,' the nanny insisted in jailhouse interview with New York Daily News.

'Someone else did.'

Ortega did not say who else could be responsible for murdering the children. 

Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to
meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became 
concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home.

After learning from the doorman that 
the nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the 
apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom.

Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma.

When
questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted 
to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the 
tragedy on her.

Ortega,
who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed
she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and
asked her to do the housework.

'She said something like, "I'm paid 
to watch the children, not clean up and do housework",' a 
law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to police after she 
woke from the coma.

Yoselyn became extremely animated 
when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she 
had numerous disagreements with mother Marina about how the kids were 
being cared for.

Reports claimed Marina didn't think 
Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk 
food.

Plea: Jocelyn Ortega, pictured centre, has pleaded not guilty to killing six-year-old Lucia Krim (right) and her two-year-old brother Leo while they were in her care at their Manhattan home

Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home

Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother

The Krims were also reportedly worried about Ortega's job 
performance in the weeks leading up to the killings and had told her 
that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace her.

But the Krims' extended family 
dispute they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to 
travel on holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican 
Republic.

In April, Ortega, was ruled fit to 
stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of first-degree 
murder and two counts of second-degree murder.

She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Last month the Krim's revealed they are expecting a baby boy in October,

Family: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin Krim and mother Marina Krim, who found her children stabbed in the bathtub and their nanny with a slit throat and wrists on the bathroom floor

Happy news: Marina and Kevin Krim, whose son and daughter were allegedly stabbed to death by their nanny last year, have revealed that they are expecting a baby boy this fall

'Hello everyone, We are very happy to let you know that Marina is expecting a baby in the fall,' read the message on the Lulu & Leo Fund.

'Nessie
can’t wait to welcome her new baby brother. We are filled with many 
emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope. 
We are very grateful to you all for your amazing support.'

In
January, Mr Krim, an executive at America's CNBC television station, 
said that they are drawing strength from their remaining child.

He
said: 'Marina and I couldn't be more proud of her - she is very smart, 
beautiful and tough. And she's grown so much over the past two months. 
She saves us every day.'
