A district judge faces up to seven years in jail after allegedly
dismissing traffic tickets against her that included expired registration on
her BMW.

Kelly Ballentine, 43, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was hit with two parking tickets and a third for the registration - totalling $268.50,
prosecutors said.

She failed to pay the November 2010 tickets on time, but then allegedly
accessed the online court system and dismissed her summonses.

Charged: Kelly Ballentine, 43, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was hit with two parking tickets and a third for the registration which totalled $268.50, prosecutors said

Ballentine has been arraigned and released on $25,000 bail. She
faces conflict of interest, public records tampering and obstruction charges.

The violations were allegedly within her magisterial district
and handled by staff in her office. She did not pay within the 30-day
limit, prosecutors said.

Court summonses were then sent to her, but she
allegedly accessed the Pennsylvania Magisterial District Judicial system and dismissed
them.

Each of the three counts of conflict of interest and six of public
records tampering could see her jailed for up to seven years if convicted.

The three obstruction charges are punishable by up to two
years in prison, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said in a press release.

'I have issued an order that she be placed on indefinite administrative leave until all criminal charges are resolved'

Lancaster County President Judge Joseph Madenspacher

She was arraigned in court on Monday before District Judge
William Benner. A preliminary hearing will take place in front of the same judge next
Thursday.

Ballentine, who was elected as a district judge in 2006, is being
represented by lawyer Royce Leon Morris of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

She has been put on paid leave while the charges are resolved,
Lancaster County President Judge Joseph Madenspacher told Lancaster Online.

Judge Madenspacher added that he will contact the Supreme Court
about the charges and they can decide if they want to further discipline her.
