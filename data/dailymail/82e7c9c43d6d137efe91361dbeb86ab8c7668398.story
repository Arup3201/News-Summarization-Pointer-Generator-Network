Two Western female doctors and three Afghan colleagues have been kidnapped by masked gunmen in a remote area of north-east Afghanistan.

Officials said they were snatched while travelling on horseback between Yaftal and Ragh districts, about 55 miles from Badakhshan provincial capital Faizabad.

A witness said: ‘I saw gunmen surround them. The people who kidnapped them had scarves over their faces.

‘They kept the two women on the horses and told the Afghans to walk in front of the horses. The kidnappers took the group’s bags and carried them themselves.’

The doctors and their colleagues, believed to be a guide and two interpreters, were employed by a non-profit humanitarian organisation, the Swiss-based Medair, and had been working to help to treat malnourished children.

Abdul Maroof Rasikh, spokesman for Badakhshan province’s governor, said it was unclear who kidnapped them.

A massive search operation involving police, military and volunteers was underway, he said, but the area was rugged and ‘very difficult’ to travel in. 

It is the same area where British surgeon Karen Woo, 36, was murdered in 2010 by militants as she returned to the capital Kabul.

The area is not known as a focus for Afghan insurgents but is home to groups of mainly criminal gunmen.

Police said the aid workers had been visiting a health clinic in Yawan district, where the road had been destroyed by floods.

'They were travelling by donkey. Two foreign women and their Afghan translators were kidnapped and we have started a search operation,' said Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, police spokesman for northern Afghanistan.

NATO-led forces said they had no information on the kidnapping, while NGOs operating in the area declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue.

The kidnapping of foreigners has become relatively common in parts of Afghanistan since U.S.-backed Afghan forces toppled the former Taliban government in 2001, sparking a decade-long anti-insurgent war.

Concerns for the hostages' safety are likely to be high after another Western aid worker, captured in neighbouring Pakistan, was executed last month.

Khalil Dale, 60, was taken at gunpoint while working with the British Red Cross in January.

He was found beheaded and riddled with bullets on April 28, in an orchard in the south-west city of Quetta.

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility and along with the body was a note addressed to the chief of police, which read: 'This is the body of Khalil who we have slaughtered for not paying a ransom amount.'

And in October 2010, British aid , worker Linda Norgrove died in a botched rescue attempt after she was taken hostage in Kunar province.

It was originally reported that the 36-year-old, from the Western Isles, had died at the hands of her captors but an investigation later revealed she was in fact killed by a grenade thrown by the U.S.-led team of would-be rescuers.

Earlier this month a video was posted on jihadist websites in which American captive Warren Weinstein is seen urging Barack Obama to meet Al Qaeda's demands and set him free.

Mr Weinstein, 70, was working for a development consultancy in Pakistan, where was taken from his house in the city of Lahore last August.
