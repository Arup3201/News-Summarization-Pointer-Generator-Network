Jose Mourinho doesn't agree with Luis Suarez's stadium ban following the Uruguay frontman's alleged bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.

The Chelsea manager agrees that the Liverpool striker should be banned from playing for a period of time but doesn't see a problem with Suarez attending his side's future matches.

Speaking to Yahoo, the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss said: 'The punishment is deserved because it's an accumulation of
acts on the football pitch.

'What I really don't like is the stadium ban. What's the
problem for Suarez to be in the stadium with the Uruguay supporters watching
the game between his country and Colombia?

'It's too hard. It's something that I really don't
understand.

'But the punishment has come through three separate
incidents, three similar mistakes. It's deserved.'
