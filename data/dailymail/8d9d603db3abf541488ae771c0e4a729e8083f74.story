Cesc Fabregas deserved a better send-off from Barcelona, says former team-mate Cristian Tello.

The playmaker is currently lighting up the Premier League for leaders Chelsea, having joined the west Londoners from his boyhood club in a £30million deal this summer.

But Tello believes the former Arsenal man left the Nou Camp under a cloud, saying Fabregas' dream was to succeed at the Catalan giants.

'He didn’t leave the club as he deserved,' said Tello, who also left Barcelona this summer, moving to Porto on loan in a two-year deal.

'He left through the back door. He was a spectacular player, you only have to see the goals and assists from his time at Barça.

'I suppose he will be hurting because his dream was to triumph at Barcelona.'  

Fabregas made over 100 appearances for the Catalan giants having joined from Arsenal in 2011.

However, the Spain international will now be fully focused on helping Chelsea continue their blistering start to the season having won six of their opening seven Premier League fixtures to top the table. 

The midfielder has struck up an impressive partnership with Chelsea's top scorer Diego Costa, and assisted the former Atletico Madrid striker four times already this term.
