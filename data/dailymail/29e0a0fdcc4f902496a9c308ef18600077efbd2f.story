Two crosses which feature models of destroyed towns are to go on display in St Paul's to mark the centenary of the First World War this year.

The pair of 20ft white sculptures, by artist Gerry Judah, will hang at the head of the nave, greeting visitors as they walk into the cathedral.

The structures feature models of modern-day towns ruined by conflict, inspired by the likes of Aleppo and Homs in Syria, and Baghdad in Iraq.

Speaking to the Mail Online, Mr Judah said he chose to use modern conflicts as his inspiration in order to 'contemporise' the First World War.

He said: 'Given that there are going to be many memorials to the First World War itself, I chose to say it's no just about remembering, but realising that the conflicts that are being fought now are knock-ons from that war.

'For example when they carved up the Ottoman Empire they created states like Syria, which is where these conflicts are being fought.

'I wanted to contermporise the War, to say we can look at 100 years ago, but let's also look at today.

'These wars may not be on the vast scale of people that died in the First World War, but these conflicts are still a tragedy.

'What good is just remembering, why don't you look at what's happening today. When you bring the two together it becomes more poignant.'

Mr Judah added: 'It is a great honour to have been selected to create these two new works as part of the World War I commemorations at St Paul’s Cathedral, a building that has historically come to symbolise the triumph of hope and redemption in the face of conflict.

'These sculptures are intended to appeal to our feelings of pity and charity, as well as filling us with hope for the future, which, I feel, is one of the principal purposes of a great place of worship, contemplation and meditation such as St Paul’s.'

Mr Judah has previously created a sculpture of part of the Auschwitz concentration camp for the Imperial war Museum in 2000.

He has produced similar cruciform sculptures for both the Imperial War Museum in 2010, and St Mary Brookfield church in London in 2012.

The new pieces will remain in St Paul's for eight months, covering the centenary of the war in August.

The Chancellor of St Paul’s Cathedral, The Reverend Canon Mark Oakley, comments: 'Gerry Judah’s striking sculptures confront us with the reality of a War that saw thousands and thousands of young people from around the world buried with white crosses and stones over their remains.'

The artworks will be unveiled to the public on Palm Sunday, next week.
