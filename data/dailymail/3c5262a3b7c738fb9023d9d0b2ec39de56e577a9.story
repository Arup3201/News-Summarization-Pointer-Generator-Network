Alex Salmond might be struggling to win the argument over Scottish independence but today insisted he is winning the battle of the bulge.

The Scottish First Minister revealed he has been on the 5:2 diet for months, and has lost 2st 4lbs, with another stone to go to reach his target weight.

Accusing George Osborne of coming to the diet craze late, Mr Salmond said he had been advised to try the 5:2 by Mervyn King when he was the governor of the Bank of England.

Mr Salmond said that after easily shedding the pounds, he is now struggling to reach his target weight.

'I have lost 2st 4lbs. The last stone is proving a bit trickier than the previous 2st 4lb,' he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme.

Mr Osborne has used the 5:2 diet to get in shape, which means he has to fast for two days a week.

It appears to be paying off, with the Tory Chancellor looking noticeably trimmer in recent weeks.

But Mr Salmond claimed the Chancellor had come to the diet late. 'He started substantially after I did. On the issue of 5:2, as one the issue of sterling, George Osborne will see the error of his ways.'

Bizarrely, Mr Salmond decided to go on the diet after taking advice from the country's top banker.

'Mervyn King told me to go on it,' he said. 'I can reveal my dietary adviser is the former governor of the Bank of England.'

Mr Osborne imposed austerity measures
 on his food intake as part of an image makeover, which aides hope will 
boost his chances of succeeding David Cameron.

The Chancellor has already abandoned his 
foppish former haircut in favour of a close cropped Caesar cut, which 
his allies believe looks more serious.

The diet requires Mr Osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five.
