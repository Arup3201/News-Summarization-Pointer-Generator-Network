Charles Barkley on Tuesday doubled down on his recent controversial comments about events in Ferguson, Missouri, as he maintained the black community needs to shoulder more blame for tragedies like the one that befell 18-year-old Michael Brown.

'We as black people, we got a lot of crooks,' the NBA legend told CNN in an interview he gave after taking heat for similar comments he made on a Philadelphia sports radio show last week.

The 51-year-old, who also famously supported the acquittal of George Zimmerman, publicly agreed with the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson and doesn't fault police who tend to single out black people while investigating crimes.

'There's a reason they racially profile us at times,' he told CNN. 'Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes its right.'

'There's a reason they racially profile us': In an interview with CNN, Barkley defended his recent support of Ferguson police and said black people can tend toward lawlessness and are, therefor, at fault for racial profiling

'We have to look at ourselves in the mirror,' he said of people in black communities. 'To act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff is disingenuous'

He maintains a sort of 'bad seed' take on both police and the black community. There are good cops and bad cops, he said, black criminals and those who abide by the law.

And since, as Barkley said, the black community 'got a lot of crooks,' he thinks casting blame at police helps no one.

'We have to look at ourselves in the mirror,' he said of people in black communities. 'To act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff is disingenuous.'

Interviewer Brooke Baldwin then turned the subject to another case involving police and their handling of situations involving black men--that of Eric Garner, a New York man who died after several police held him down and put him in a choke hold.

Backlash: Civil rights activist Van Jones, himself a CNN contributor, called Barkley's comments inflammatory and irresponsible

'I don't think they were trying to kill Mr. Garner,' Barkley told Baldwin. 'He was a big man and they tried to get him down.'

Barkley said the media tend to only bring up race when situations like these emerge, and then it's the same group of national civil rights figures--and not members of the specific community--who voice outrage.

'[The] same sad sack of black characters,' he called them. 'We need someone in St. Louis to stand up and say "hey let's handle this situation."'

CNN's own Van Jones, himself a black civil rights activist, spoke to Don Lemon to hit back at Barkley for the comments he said were 'inflammatory' and 'irresponsible.'

'Barkley really went far beyond just saying he agreed or disagreed with that grand jury. He said a lot of things that were really inflammatory,' Jones said. 'The worst of it was his contention that African Americans who were concerned about this case were somehow anti-cop.

'That is really dangerous. African Americans want better policing, not no policing,' Jones continued, before he said that African Americans shouldn't have to choose between the two.

The outrage began on Monday, when Barkley's comments to Mike Missanelli of Philadelphia's 97.5 The Fanatic last made Tuesday started to be heard.

'There is no excuse for people to be out there burning down people's businesses, burning down police cars,' he told Missanelli as he referred to the rioters as 'scumbags.'

Barkley went on to commend police who work in black areas. 

'If it wasn’t for the cops we would be living in the Wild, Wild West in our neighborhoods,' he said. 'We can’t pick out certain incidentals that don’t go our way and act like the cops are all bad.

Start of the controversy: Barkley told a Philadelphia radio show host last week that he supports the Ferguson police and the grand jury's decision not to indict unarmed black teen Michael Brown's killer Darren Wilson

'Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasn't for the cops?' he said.

Barkley, who's become a high-profile sports commentator since leaving the NBA behind in 2000, said the media is at fault for at least some of what's gone on in the wake of Michael Brown's August 4 death.

'The true story came out from the grand jury testimony,' he said. 'I can’t believe anything I hear on television anymore.

'And, that’s why I don’t like talking about race issues with the media anymore, because they  love this stuff, and lead people to jump to conclusions.

'The media shouldn’t do that. They never do that when black people kill each other.'

Barkley also publicly sided with a decision to exonerate George Zimmerman in 2013 after he was tried in the shooting death of another unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin, notes the Christian Science Monitor.

Looters robbed Ferguson businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict Darren Wilson, which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue
