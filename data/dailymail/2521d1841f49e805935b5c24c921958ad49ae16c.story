It's a brave man who swims up to a shark to rub its snout.

But this is exactly what underwater whisperer Jorge, was able to do to tame the 8ft-long creature - causing the animal to become overwhelmed by the stimulation.

Having calmed the shark, the stunning images show Jorge gently grasp its body and turn the predator so it is upright.

Double trouble: As long as you 'stay humble' you can enjoy a shark dive without any danger

The amazing moment was witnessed by French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie, 39, just five metres underwater on a dive in the Gardens of the Queen National Marine Park in Cuba.

'I felt a mixed feeling between fascination and excitement whilst I was underwater watching the incredible moment,' Mathieu said.

The shark's trance-like state is known as "tonic immobility", a temporary paralysis caused by rubbing the animal's nose.

Mathieu, of Montpellier, France, explains: 'By rubbing the shark's snout, our guide was able to overstimulate its sensory organs, called the ampullae of Lorenzini.

'We were not in any danger at all, but an ordinary diver should never try to catch a shark or even to play with one.

'This kind of manipulation can be made only by experienced divers who know how the shark is going to react.'

The state of paralysis lasts for an average of 15 minutes, but most guides hold the shark for just two to three minutes.

This allows enough time for divers to approach the shark and touch the smooth texture of its skin.

Diving with around 20 sharks, Mathieu was able to watch as his guide carefully interacted with each of them.

Tranquil: The state of paralysis lasts for an average of fifteen minutes, but most guides hold the shark for just two to three minutes

The large size and cutting teeth of the silky shark make it a potentially dangerous species.

Mathieu says: 'We were totally safe and secure during the experience, as long as you stay humble and keep in mind you're just a guest, you can enjoy the dive without any danger.

'When people see these photographs they feel sheer amazement and astonishment, as it's not something you see every day.

'Sharks are incredible and beautiful creatures, much more sensitive, fragile and vulnerable than we can imagine.'
