Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has repeatedly blamed civil servants for the £100million fiasco, insisting ministers are not to blame

Official investigators into the Government’s West Coast franchise fiasco have demanded an electronic audit of Transport Department staff e-mails in a bid to unearth evidence of a biased ‘Anyone But Branson’ campaign.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin made the admission today while giving evidence to the transport select committee.

Appearing alongside his Permanent Secretary Philip Rutnam, he said the two independent investigations into the shambles had asked ministers and senior officials to instigate a ‘e-mail capture’ system to electronically scan for and root out any potentially biased internal references to Sir Richard Branson and Virgin Trains during their bid to retain the franchise.

It follows allegations revealed in the Daily Mail that there was an ‘anti-Virgin’ culture within the Transport Department which had been reflected in some ‘derogatory’ e-mails which pointed towards institutional bias among some staff.

Mr McLoughlin admitted his department made 'very regrettable' errors in its handling of the bidding process for Britain’s busiest rail line.

The minister was forced to explain to a select committee why his department ploughed ahead with the bidding process for the West Coast Main Line contract despite knowing the process was flawed.

Mr McLoughlin said ‘basic mistakes’ had led to a ‘catastrophic failure.’ It would be a ‘text book chapter’ for future Civil Service training.

The 13-year deal was handed to rival 
firm First Group in August, but last month days after becoming Mr McLoughlin announced serious flaws had been found.

The
deal was cancelled, and ministers spent £1million drawing up plans for 
the government to take over running the line from London to Scotland 
before asking Sir Richard to continue providing services for up to a 
year.

Mr McLoughlin told the transport select committee: 'Mistakes which were made should not have been made. It is very regrettable and very serious for the department.

‘We have already apologised to the bidders involved and the taxpayers who have a right to expect better and I would repeat that.'

An official report this week claimed the Department for Transport was biased against Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Trains bid to continue running the West Coast mainline.

Louise Ellman, chairman of the committee, said the interim report 'can only be described as a damning indictment’ of the Department for Transport.

The fiasco was ‘major catastrophe’ 
that had huge implications for the whole of the rail franchise process, she added.

But Mr McLoughlin insisted there were ‘a lot of people who work incredibly hard in the department who had noth9ng to do with this West Coast franchise and I wouldn’t want them to be condemned’.

He said it was now ‘obvious’ that decisions were taken by middle-ranking officials which were ‘not referred up’ to senior civil servants or ministers’.

The devastating interim report into the West Coast fiasco made for uncomfortable reading for the Department for Transport.

The key findings of Sam Laidlaw's investigation included:

Asked if he was grateful to Sir Richard’s for launching a legal challenge which highlighted the flaws, Mr McLoughlin added: ‘I think the country owes a debt of gratitude to Richard Branson for all he has achieved in the rail and aviation industries.’

But his comments appeared at odds with revelations about his department's attitude to Sir Richard.

Insider witnesses described this culture as ‘ABB’ or – ‘Anyone But Branson.’ They said it had its roots in Virgin’s successful and tough re-negotiaton of its franchise in 2006 which had left Whitehall officials feeling battered and ‘nailed to the floor’ after being outwitted by a smarter Virgin team.

Asked by MPs whether staff e-mails were to be scanned as part of the investigation Mr McLoughlin said: ’They have asked for it to be done. We have now received a request.’

Asked if he could have asked more questions to unearth earlier the scale of the fiasco, Mr McLoughlin said: 'Perhaps I could have asked more questions but I would have got the same answers.’

Mr Rutnam side-stepped questions about ‘who knew what and when’ by insisting he could not comment on it because the matter was still the subject of a ‘Human Resources’ investigated by personnel officials. Three staff have already been suspended.

Mr Rutnam said: ’It would be wrong to pre-empt that investigation by saying who I believe is responsible.’

He said the ‘risks’ should have been ‘escalated’ to senior officials and ministers as soon as they were known, but were not: ’The question of who knew what, when will come out when these investigations, including the Humans Resources are completed.

Virgin trains boss Sir Richard Branson branded the bidding process 'insane' and launched a legal challenge. He was vindicated this week when an official report said the Department for Transport was biased against him

On Monday the interim report into the fiasco concluded that the Transport Department was biased against Sir Richard Branson’s bid to continue running the West Coast mainline. But that was just one of a catalogue of failures – including of leadership- which contributed to the shambles, it concluded.

The independent investigation into the scandal by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw highlights ‘significant errors’, ‘weak governance’ , and a ‘flawed process’ with in which ‘bidders were treated inconsistently.’

But the report also highlights contributory factors including a general lack of leadership, late planning, hurried execution, and cut-backs within the transport Department which put key decisions into the hands of relatively junior, inexperienced and ‘stretched’ staff.

Today Mr McLoughlin apologised to taxpayers who are now facing a £40million bill – which could rise to £100million - following Mr McLoughlin's decision to scrap the West Coast franchise process following the finding of serious errors by the DfT.

Mrs Ellman asked the Department’s top civil servant Mr Rutnam, who only took up his post this summer, who at the department had taken the decision to go on with the bidding process regardless. Mr Rutnam replied: "I am afraid that I am not going to answer that question" saying that investigations into the whole matter were still going on.

The Laidlaw report also said the companies bidding for the franchise were not provided with adequate information, the DfT did not follow its own guidance, and the evaluation of the financial robustness of the bids was "developed late, in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation".

Mr Laidlaw said the DfT had undergone staff reductions and frequent changes of leadership, and organisational changes and the department's structure "resulted in a lack of clarity around allocation of repsonsibility" for the bidding competition.

He concluded that these factors raised "potentially significant issues about the ability of the DfT effectively to conduct rail franchise competitions".

Mr Rutnam said that when he arrived at the department in July he had received assurances that the West Coast process was "going well". He said it was not until October that defects and errors associated with the process became clear.

The FirstGroup had been due to take over the West Coast line on December 9. The Government is now in discussions with Virgin about it continuing to run services for up to 14 months until an interim franchise competition is held ahead of a competition for a full franchise.

The DfT, under the leadership of the then transport secretary Justine Greening, had decided in August to award a new 13 year West Coast franchise rival transport company FirstGroup for £7billion - £700million motre than Sir richard’s Virgin bid.

Three civil servants have been suspended by the Departmernt as a result of the fiasco.

But one of them, Kate Mingay, the 
department's commercial and technical services director, issued a 
statement through her lawyers shortly after her suspension saying her 
role in the West Coast process had been ‘inaccurately portrayed mainly 
due to statements and other comment made by the Department for Transport
itself’.

She added: ‘I would like to make it 
clear that I did not have lead responsibility for this project and that 
neither I nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the 
economic modelling for this project, or for any DfT project.

‘Nor did I have any responsibility for
the financial modelling in respect of this project and I have not been 
involved in briefing DfT ministers or other Government ministers in 
respect of this project.’
