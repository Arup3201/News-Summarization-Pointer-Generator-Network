Louis van Gaal will share a drink with Sir Alex Ferguson when he arrives at Manchester United as he sets his sights on returning the Premier League trophy to Old Trafford.

The current Holland national team manager has signed a three-year deal to take charge at United after this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

The 62-year-old has a proven track record of success having won league crowns with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich but will chat with his friend Ferguson to gain the inside knowledge on how to prosper at United.

'I will certainly go for a drink with him,' Van Gaal said on Dutch TV.

'I've often done it before. We are like each other, I always put more pressure on myself than other people do.'

His first task will be to restore confidence at United after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh.

Asked what his objectives were, Van Gaal said: 'That they are back as soon as possible at spot number one, (that) they (fans) will think they are champions of England again within a year.

'Spain saw me succeed in my first year and in Germany as well. In England, it must also be possible.

'But there can only be one champion. I would be proud if it works right away.'

Van Gaal may now be switching his immediate attention to the World Cup in Brazil but he has reportedly already handed United a list of transfer targets.

The Dutchman, however, also has a fine reputation for bringing through youngsters and he intends to give youth its chance again at United.

'You do not only do it with stars, but also with youth players,' said Van Gaal, who will succeed the sacked David Moyes.

Youngster Adnan Januzaj, whose emergence was one of the most positive aspects of Moyes' ill-fated reign, is looking forward to working with the new manager.

The 19-year-old said: 'He is an excellent coach, who has won a lot of prizes. I think United are facing a bright future.'Â

One of Van Gaal's first jobs has been to appoint Ryan Giggs as his assistant.

The long-serving Giggs, 40, has ended his glittering 24-season playing career to take up the opportunity.

Januzaj said: 'Giggs is very important to us. He gets a lot of respect and also helps me constantly.'

United are still to clarify the future of two of Moyes' backroom staff in coach Phil Neville and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods.

It is also unclear whether Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who came into the first-team coaching set-up during Giggs' recent four-match spell as interim manager, will still have prominent roles.

Butt had previously been working in the club's youth structure while Scholes, who retired as a player a year ago, was brought in by Giggs.
