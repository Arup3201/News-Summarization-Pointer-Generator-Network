Kim Teer was 17 when she went missing in Melbourne in 1979. She had been backpacking across the country

Kim Teer was on the trip of a lifetime backpacking around Australia when her mother last heard from her.

Kim, who was weeks away from her 18th birthday, had written to her mother, Colleen Holding, asking her to send a copy of her birth certificate so she could get a driver's license. Colleen never heard from her daughter again.

Colleen, now 73, still does not know what happened to her only child despite police investigations and two years spent travelling around Australia, visiting the places Kim had stayed in the hope someone might know something.

Kim is one of thousands of people missing across the country as Australia marks Missing Person's Week this week.

Kim's aunt Mary Hallam, 61, from the Southern Highlands of NSW said that 35 years after she went missing, the family believe that Kim is dead and police say they believe she met with foul play, but without a body, Kim's family have no answers and no finality.

'Unfortunately we all feel that Kim is no longer alive… But you can imagine, when you don't have the remains of someone, I know Colleen in her heart lives with the hope that she'll be found. That's something a parent never loses. When there's no body, there's no finality about it,' Ms Hallam told Daily Mail Australia.

Kim, described by her aunt as an artistic girl, took off backpacking around Australia in 1978 at the age of 17. She returned to her aunt's home in Bathurst for Christmas in 1978, the last time her family saw her, before continuing her travels in 1979.

After travelling across Western Australia, Queensland and NSW, she eventually stopped in Melbourne and shared a flat with two fellow travellers.

'Kim had an agreement with her mum that she would stay in constant contact to let her know she was okay, which she did, she sent letters to her mum and called her,' said Ms Hallam.

When Kim's mother Colleen did not hear from Kim as her 18th birthday approached she became distressed and knew something was wrong.

'There's no way Kim would have not contacted her mother for her birthday,' said Ms Hallam.

Colleen and her husband, Kim's step-father, drove to Melbourne to try and find her and then travelled across the country talking to people who might have known Kim.

'She just vanished off the face of the earth; [Colleen] never found any of her belongings. She spent two years going around Australia trying to find her,' said Ms Hallam.

Kim's disappearance devastated both her parents, who had separated years earlier.

Ms Hallam has not seen Kim's father Greg Teer for years, but is informed by his family that he is now 'very much a recluse… he can't quite cope with the fact that his daughter's gone.'

Colleen, who worked as a cosmetics buyer for Myer, threw herself into work and hobbies in order to distract herself from the heartbreaking reality of Kim's disappearance.

'She worked really hard all her life and owns her own home, she did a lot of things to take her mind off it, retain her sanity.

To mark Missing Persons Week this year, Australian Federal Police are attempting to raise awareness about the 35,000 people reported missing in Australia each year.

Of those reported missing, approximately half are 'recidivists', such as teenagers who regularly run away from foster carers or other institutions, almost all of whom are found.

Approximately 85 percent of all those reported missing in the country are found within 48 hours and police say it is crucial that people tell police as soon as they notice someone is missing.

'It is a myth that you have to wait 24 hours. We're always hearing on American TV that you don't call police or start searching [in the first 24 hours],' said Rebecca Kotz, from the Missing Person Unit with the Australian Federal Police.

'It couldn't be further from the truth. Police need to get onto it as soon as they can. In Australia we know for a fact the first 24 hours are so critical.'

This year the focus of Missing Persons Week is on people with dementia, who comprise 10 percent of missing people reported in Australia.

'We have people who will wander off. They might be 200m from their front door, they might also fall into scrub and hit their head,' said Ms Kotz.

Police are encouraging people with dementia to wear identity bracelets with a contact phone number and information about their condition, so that police can help them if they are found.

'She taught herself to sew and she'd make these amazing wedding dresses. She created some of the most beautiful things as a way of her dealing with the grief. It's a strange thing when something tragic happens in your life, certain people try to create something nice to balance it out.'

Ms Hallam said that her sister could not face dealing with what happened, but as she got older it has caught up to her and she finds the uncertainty harder.

'[Colleen] said: "I envy people who can bury their children, because at least you know where they are, you know what happened to them,"' said Ms Hallam.

Since retiring in 2009, Ms Hallam has dedicated herself to working with the NSW and Victorian police to trying to work out what happened to Kim.

Police have re-opened the cold case and a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of someone involved in Kim's disappearance, was announced in September last year in the hope of providing new leads into the case.

Ms Hallam says she thinks there are a few suspicious people police should talk to

'I've put several scenarios to the police, but as with an ongoing investigation they won’t comment,' she said.

But for Kim's family, finding out what happened to her is less significant than recovering her body.

'Whether or not, anyone was ever found responsible, that'd be good because people do these things and get away with it, but to know where she is would be the best outcome of all.

'To have her remains found would be the best outcome ever, at least then we would know where she was, we could bury her properly… To be able to bury her remains would give you some sort of peace of mind, that's the wrong word, and I hate the word closure, because you never have closure on things like this, you think about it every waking minute of the day. It would give her some sort of ending to a long search.'

Investigators would like to speak to anyone who has any information about Kim's disappearance or had any contact with her between August and October 1979.Anyone with any information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers 1800 333 000 or via the website at www.crimestoppers.com.au
