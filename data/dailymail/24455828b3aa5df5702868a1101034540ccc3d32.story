Astronauts aboard the International Space Station have taken a photograph of gravity waves - an atmospheric phenomenon that is impossible to see from Earth.

The image makes the clouds look as if they are rippling, an occurrence known as gravity waves, which shows the effect of gravity on the earth's weather system.

These particular gravity waves were over Lake Superior, one of the great lakes of Northern America, Southern Ontario, Canada and to the southwest of Pukaskwa National Park.

Several distinct sets of parallel cloud bands are visible in the photograph.

Gravity waves are produced when 
moisture-laden air encounters imbalances in air density, such as when cool air flows over warmer air.

This can make the flowing air oscillate up and down as it moves, which in turn causes clouds to condense as the air rises.

They then cool and evaporate away as the air sinks and warms, which produces the distinctive parallel bands of clouds.

Nasa said the orientation of the cloud bands in this image suggests that air flowing off of the land surfaces to the north is interacting with moist, stable air over the lake surface, creating gravity waves.

Sunglint - caused by light reflection off a water surface - can also be seen near Isle Royale

The photograph was taken on 24 June with a Nikon D3S digital camera by members of the Expedition 36 crew, and was then enhanced by experts on Earth to improve the contrast and remove lens artifacts.

It is also possible to see another phenomenon in the image, known as sunglint.

Sunglint is caused by light reflection off a water surface.

Some of the reflected light travels directly back towards the observer, resulting in a bright mirror-like appearance over large expanses of water.

Water currents and changes in surface tension, typically caused by presence of oils or surfactants, alter the reflective properties of the water and can be highlighted by sunglint.

In this image, surface water currents are visible to the east of Isle Royale that are oriented similarly to the gravity waves, suggesting that they too are the product of winds moving off of the land surface.
