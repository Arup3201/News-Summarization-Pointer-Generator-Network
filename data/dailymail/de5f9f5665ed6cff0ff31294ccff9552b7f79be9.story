President Obama made a personal phone call to USA captain Clint Dempsey and goalkeeper Tim Howard after their heroics against Belgium on Tuesday night.

The USA kept Belgium at bay until extra time before goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku broke their resistance and sent Belgium through to a quarter-final with Argentina.

But the President was quick to show his appreciation for the side's efforts at the World Cup.

Heroic: American goalkeeper Howard made a staggering 16 saves in the extra time defeat

He said: 'Clint, Tim. Man I just wanted to call to say you did us proud. You guys did great. There’s someone here who’s first sport was soccer although I was never that good.

'To see the way you guys captured the hearts and imaginations of the whole country is unbelievable and obviously the way the sport has been growing steadily because kids have been playing it at a young age, but this is the first time you have had an entire country focused.

'Clint you were fantastic and Tim I don’t know how you are going to survive the mobs when you come back home. You are going to have to shave your beard so they don’t know who you are.

'You guys did us all proud not just by how hard you played and how well you did; you guys just carried yourselves with a lot of class. It makes people really respect the sport and you guys are really great models for a lot of sportsman here in the states.

'I know it is disappointing but what you guys accomplished is really, really significant and it will make a difference to the country so congratulate coach. I know maybe you have got another couple of guys there.

'Fantastic job everybody and I hope I get to see you guys again at The Whitehouse sometime soon. I’ve still got my jacket that you guys gave me. I appreciate you guys. Safe travels back. Bye bye.'

Howard, meanwhile, was randomly drug-tested immediately after Tuesday's match during which he set a World Cup record by making an amazing 16 saves.

Howard wasn't able to join his teammates in the locker room immediately after the defeat because FIFA selected him to take the test.

‘I got dragged into drug testing, again, randomly,’ Howard told ESPN Radio when asked about the sombre mood after the match. ‘So I didn't hear all of [the reactions].’
