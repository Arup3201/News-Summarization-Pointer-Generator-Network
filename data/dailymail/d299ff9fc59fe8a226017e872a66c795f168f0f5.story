To millions of her subjects she is the ultimate Queen Bee.

Now Her Majesty is turning her attention to the plight of Britain’s honey bees, and funding grants from £500 to £1,000 to encourage people to set up beehives on Duchy of Lancaster land.

One condition for the grants is learning to distinguish queen bees from workers.

Funding: The Queen will offer out grants of up to £1,000 for those willing to keep bees on her estate

The Queen is apparently concerned by the rapid decline in Britain’s bee colonies linked to the varroa mite which has also devastated honeybees in the United States and mainland Europe.

Other causes include poor weather, pesticides and pollution. Without pollination by bees, Britain’s crops will suffer.

Beekeeping enthusiasts include  TV celebrities Kate Humble and Bill Turnbull, but many are put off by the cost.

So the Duchy, which provides a personal income to the Sovereign, has launched the start-up grants for tenant farmers or anyone else willing to keep hives on its 46,000 acres in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire.

The cash will be used for people to attend a training course, which costs about £60 for six three-hour sessions; to purchase a hive, which varies from £250 to £350; to buy a swarm of bees for about £150, and a protective suit with veiled helmet and gloves at £70 to £120.

Recipients will also have to join a local beekeepers’ association which costs about £30 a year.

There is no limited cash pot for the grants, and each application  will be decided on merit.

Nathan Thompson, the Duchy’s chief executive, said: ‘As a responsible landlord, the Duchy is acutely aware of the need to protect the natural environment and supporting the bee population is an intrinsic part of that.’

Beekeepers will be encouraged to keep the British native dark bee, or black bee, which is more resistant to British weather.
