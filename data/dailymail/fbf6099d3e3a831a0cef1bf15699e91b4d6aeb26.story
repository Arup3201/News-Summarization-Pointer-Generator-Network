Former member of 'The Real Housewives of Miami' cast Ana Quincoces was arrested Sunday in Key Largo for driving with a suspended license - an incident she blamed on a cockroach infestation at a friend’s home.

But a 911 call from an earlier incident involving Quincoces suggests that unrequited love may have set her on the path to jail.   

The 50-year-old lawyer and cookbook author from Coral Gables was pulled over in her Subaru SUV by a Monroe County sheriff's deputy at mile marker 99 on US 1 at around 3.40am.

The officer wrote in the incident report, cited by Keys Info Net, that he stopped Quincoces because he recognized her from a previous encounter that took place just hours earlier.

Police responding to a ‘disturbance call’ on Bahama Avenue confronted Ms Quincoces and informed her that her license had been suspended indefinitely February 9 and 'she was not to drive.'

In the early hours of Sunday morning, the same deputy stopped Quincoces outside the Courtyard by Marriot Hotel in Key Largo and demanded to know why she was driving after being explicitly told not to get behind the wheel.

The reality TV star was taken to the Plantation Key jail on a misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license and released just after 5am on her own recognizance.

Quincoces starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 and also made several appearances on the program in 2011 and 2013.

Roach phobia: Quincoces said the house where she was staying turned out to be infested with cockroaches, which prompted her to get in her car and head home 

On Monday, the 50-year-old 'Real Housewives' alum explained to Keysnet.com that she was staying at a house in Key Largo, which had been listed by a realtor friend, but discovered that it was crawling with cockroaches.

Desperate to get away from the critters, she got in her car and set out for home in Coral Gables.

Quincoces claimed she ‘didn’t realize’ her license was suspended, even though deputies warned her she was not allowed to drive just hours earlier.

The lawyer-turned-chef chalked up the entire incident to an ‘administrative glitch’ and accused police of being ‘overzealous.’

But according to the celebrity blog Gossip Extra, it all started hours earlier when Ana Quincoces drove down to Key Largo and barged into her ex-boyfriend’s home searching for his new girlfriend.

A 911 call placed by the homeowner allegedly picked up a shouting match between Quincoces, her former lover and his new flame.

Quincoces was reportedly heard yelling in the background that she came all this way after a night of drinking and had no intention of going anywhere.

The man repeatedly tried to convince Quincoces to leave, at one point telling her: 'I don’t want you here, I’m through with you!'

The 911 call concluded with the arrival of deputies. Quincoces’ ex declined to press charges against her, but because the jilted woman appeared drunk, the responding officers seized her license and ordered her not to drive.
