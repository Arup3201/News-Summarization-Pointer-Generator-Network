Airline complaints surged 20percent last year as grumpy airline passengers complained about being squeezed into smaller seats and flights that are becoming even more packed.

An independent review of airlines by researchers at Wichita State and Purdue universities found that United offered the worst service to passengers of all U.S. carriers.

Virgin America had the happiest fliers in 2012, according to the Airline Quality Rating, which measures Department of Transportation figures for on-time rates, overbooking, mishandled bags and consumer complaints.

Still, researchers found that, overall, airlines appear to be doing a better job, recording fewer late flights, fewer over-bookings and fewer mishandled bags.

Cramped: Passengers are complaining more as airlines make seats smaller and pack more passengers onto flights in an effort to maximize profits

But, that doesn't mean passengers are are less grumpy.

'The way airlines have taken 130-seat airplanes and expanded them to 150 seats to squeeze out more revenue I think is finally catching up with them,' said Dean Headley, a business professor at Wichita State University who has co-written the annual report for 23 years.

'People are saying, "Look, I don't fit here. Do something about this." At some point airlines can't keep shrinking seats to put more people into the same tube,' he said.

For the first time since 2007, the overall airline industry rating dropped from the previous year.

Fliers lodged more than 11,400 formal complaints last year, compared to 9,400 in 2011.

United had the highest rate of complaints - with 4.24 for every 100,00 passengers. That rate is nearly two and a half times higher than the next-most-complained-about airline, American.

Worst: United Airlines had the worst airline quality rating in the country, including the most complaints in 2012

Best: The relatively-new Virgin America offered the best service, according to Department of Transportation statistics analyzed by researchers

The Airline Quality Report, produced each year by researchers at Wichita State and Purdue universities ranks the nation's airlines based on Department of Transportation statistics.

The report takes into account on-time rate, mishandled baggage reports, over-booking and complaints filed.

The industry average rating got worse this year for the first time since 2007.

'They're just fed up. They’re fed up 
to the point that they are willing to make complaints to the Department 
of Transportation,' Purdue University Professor Brent Bowen, the 
co-author of the report, told MailOnline.

'They try complaining to the airlines, but the airlines don’t care, they’re not responsive and they don’t change.'

Professor Bowen said United fared so poorly because 2012 was the first year United and Continental were operating as an integrated airline after their 2010 merger.

Consumer satisfaction usually declines dramatically after a merger. 

'When you take two mediocre airlines and you put them together, you get one bad one,' Bowen said of the merger.

He noted that Delta - rated the best of the major air carriers this year - has only just recovered after its 2008 merger with Northwest.

The dependency was smaller when it came to being on time.

Hawaiian Airlines performed best at sticking to time schedules in 2012, while Skywest Inc's ExpressJet and AMR Corp's American Airlines were the worst, according to the study.

Hawaiian, owned by Hawaiian Holdings Inc, had the best on-time performance last year, at 93.4 percent. The two worst performers were at 76.9 percent.

Customer complaints per 100,000 passengers increased from 1.19 in 2011 to 1.43 in 2012, according to the study, a joint project funded as part of faculty research activities at Wichita State and Purdue universities.

The industry is even looking at ways 
to make today's smaller-than-a-broom closet toilets more compact in the 
hope of squeezing a few more seats onto planes.

'I
can't imagine the uproar that making toilets smaller might generate,' 
Headley said, especially given that passengers increasingly weigh more 
than they use to. Nevertheless, 'will it keep them from flying? I doubt 
it would.'

In recent years, some airlines have shifted to larger planes that can carry more people, but that hasn't been enough to make up for an overall reduction in flights.

The rate at which passengers with tickets were denied seats because planes were full rose to 0.97 denials per 10,000 passengers last year, compared with 0.78 in 2011.

It used to be in cases of overbookings that airlines usually could find a passenger who would volunteer to give up a seat in exchange for cash, a free ticket or some other compensation with the expectation of catching another flight later that day or the next morning. Not anymore.

'Since flights are so full, there are no seats on those next flights. So people say, "No, not for $500, not for $1,000,"' said airline industry analyst Robert W. Mann Jr.

Regional carrier SkyWest had the highest involuntary denied boardings rate last year, 2.32 per 10,000 passengers.

But not every airline overbooks flights in an effort to keep seats full. JetBlue and Virgin America were the industry leaders in avoiding denied boardings, with rates of 0.01 and 0.07, respectively.

United Airlines had the highest consumer complaint rate of the 14 airlines included in the report, with 4.24 complaints per 100,000 passengers. That was nearly double the airline's complaint rate the previous year. Southwest had the lowest rate, at 0.25.

Consumer complaints were significantly higher in the peak summer travel months of June, July and August when planes are especially crowded.

'As airplanes get fuller, complaints get higher because people just don't like to be sardines,' Mann said.

Word of warning: American Airlines is poised to merge with US Airways and the new airline is in danger of losing its customer satisfaction - if other airline mergers is any guide, researchers say

The complaints are regarded as indicators of a larger problem because many passengers may not realize they can file complaints with Transportation Department, which regulates airlines.

At the same time complaints were increasing, airlines were doing a better job of getting passengers to their destinations on time.

The industry average for on-time arrival rate was 81.8 percent of flights, compared with 80 percent in 2011. Hawaiian Airlines had the best on-time performance record, 93.4 percent in 2012. ExpressJet and American Airlines had the worst records with only 76.9 percent of their planes arriving on time last year.

The industry's on-time performance has improved in recent years, partly due to airlines' decision to cut back on the number of flights.

'We've shown over the 20 years of doing this that whenever the system isn't taxed as much - fewer flights, fewer people, less bags - it performs better. It's when it reaches a critical mass that it starts to fracture,' Headley said.

The industry's shift to charging for fees for extra bags, or sometimes charging fees for any bags, has significantly reduced the rate of lost or mishandled bags. Passengers are checking fewer bags than before, and carrying more bags onto planes when permitted.

The industry's mishandled bag rate peaked in 2007 at 7.01 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers. It was 3.07 in 2012, down from 3.35 bags the previous year.

The report's ratings are based on statistics kept by the department for airlines that carry at least 1 percent of the passengers who flew domestically last year.

The airlines covered in the report are Air Tran, Alaska, American, American Eagle, Delta, ExpressJet, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, SkyWest, Southwest, United, US Airways and Virgin America.

The research is sponsored by Purdue University in Indiana, and by Wichita State University in Kansas.
