As an actress, model, world-class snowboarder and 2014 Paralympic bronze medalist, Amy Purdy is an inspiration to young women everywhere.

And last night, the 34-year-old motivational speaker broke down the boundaries even further by hitting the red carpet in a mini dress proudly baring her prosthetic legs.

The snowboarder looked stunning in a black and cream lace dress with floral embellishment at the OK! TV Awards Party held at the Riviera 31 cocktail lounge at the Sofitel Hotel in Los Angeles, California, last night.

Inspirational: Paralympic snowboarder Amy Purdy, who lost both of her legs when she was 19, broke down the boundaries by hitting the red carpet in a mini dress baring her prosthetic legs at the OK! TV Awards Party at Sofitel Hotel in Los Angeles, California, and she looked stunning

Amy, who starred on Dancing With The Stars alongside professional dancer and Cheryl Fernandez Versini's best friend Derek Hough, looked chic in the stylish dress, which she accessorised with a gold clutch bag.

She is the co-founder of Adaptive Action Sports, an organisation for individuals with physical disabilities who want to get involved in action sports.

 She contracted Neisseria meningitis, a form of bacterial meningitis when she was 19.

The infection led to septic shock and both of her legs had to be amputated below the knee as a result; she also lost her kidney and had to have her spleen removed.

Earlier this year, she opened up about the experience on Dancing With The Stars.

Talented: Amy, who is the co-founder of Adaptive Action Sports, an organisation for individuals with physical disabilities who want to get involved in action sports, contracted Neisseria meningitis, a form of bacterial meningitis when she was 19. She is also an actress, model and ambassador 

Amy spoke movingly of how she was just 19 when she lost her legs and kidney function after contracting bacterial meningitis.

'My dad gave me one of his kidneys,' she said. 'I always say that my dad gave me life twice. He brought me into this world, and then through his gift he kept me in this world.'

She also revealed that she had been convinced she would never walk again - until music inspired her to dance with her dad.

In action: She learnt how to snowboard just seven months after she received her leg prosthetics and went on to compete in competitions and become a national star

'And I thought if I can dance I can walk. And if I can walk I can snowboard. I can live a great life,' she said.

And right she was. She learnt how to snowboard just seven months after she received her leg prosthetics and went on to compete in competitions and become a Paralympic champion.

She received a grant from the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF), a non-profit organisation, which led to her competing in more snowboarding competitions in the U.S. 

She then became a spokesperson for the charity and found work in modelling and film; she famously modelled in a Madonna music video.
