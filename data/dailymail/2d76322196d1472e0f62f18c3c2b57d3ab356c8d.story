Claim: Rodney Bass, 67, of Wickham Bishops, Essex, took over responsibility for highways in May

A county council’s highways chief applied for compensation from his own authority after his Jaguar XK convertible hit a pothole - and was refused, it emerged today,

Rodney Bass, 67, who lives in the village of Wickham Bishops near Witham, Essex, took over responsibility for highways in May - including tackling the county’s 13,705 potholes.

The long-standing Essex County Council councillor has revealed he asked the authority for compensation three years ago when the exhaust clamp broke off his car on a road.

Mr Bass, who was forced to pay £250 in repairs, said: ‘The car is fairly low slung and I hit an elevated part of a road in Little Totham caused by subsidence around a drain, which hit the bottom of the car.

‘I submitted a claim to Essex County Council, but it was rebutted. I can empathise with those who do damage their cars - it is very irritating, but it is something we have to live with.

‘These things happen and you have to grin and bear it. We have to have our eyes open all the time when we are driving.’

Mr Bass has since replaced the car, and emphasised that he does not interfere with the claims procedure as a cabinet member for highways.

Rules state that if a road defect has been drawn to the council’s attention, is classed as severe and has not been repaired, a claim for compensation can be made for any damage caused.

In Mr Bass’s case, the problem had not been reported to County Hall. He added: ‘The council’s claims record is very good, or very bad if you are a driver.

‘Our ability to defend claims is very good, and this means we are actually inspecting and taking remedial action on severe potholes quickly.

‘If someone has damaged their vehicle they will know if we have inspected the defect and how serious it is by whether it has orange paint, which is a priority and should be dealt with within 28 days, or purple paint, which means it is less serious.’

Mr Bass, a Freemason and University of Newcastle graduate, is a retired bank executive and has been a member of Essex County Council since 1997. His interests are cricket, golf and classic cars.

Jaguar XK convertibles cost between £71,000 and £103,000 new, although it was not clear how much Mr Bass - the Conservative councillor for Heybridge and Tollesbury - paid for his vehicle.
