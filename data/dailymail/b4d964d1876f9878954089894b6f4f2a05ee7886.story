Clay Aiken lost his bid for Congress on Tuesday and while others might retreat to lick their wounds, the former American Idol star has grasped the opportunity to bounce back on to TV.

Aiken has parlayed his political campaigning as a Democrat in North Carolina into a new fly-on-the-wall docu-series with the Esquire Network.

The cable network, owned by NBC Universal, made the announcement on Tuesday night after it came to light that Aiken would not be headed for Capitol Hill.

Man of the people: Clay Aiken, Democratic candidate for U.S. Congress in North Carolina's Second District, poses for a selfie with supporters after casting his vote in the midterm elections on Tuesday. He was defeated in his bid - but not for long as he returns with a new reality show

The series is directed by Academy Award-winning documentary-maker Simon Chinn and Emmy winner Jonathan Chinn.

It emerged that cameras for the TV show have followed 35-year-old gay single father Aiken since he announced his run in February.

The series will follow his life in politics as he hopped on campaign tour buses, held strategy meetings, glad-handed at events and went door-to-door to canvass voters in the run-up to the midterms.

Aiken, a former special education teacher who finished second in the 2003 American Idol final, lost his challenge to 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers on Tuesday.

The four-hour series, yet untitled, is scheduled for early 2015. 

NBC said: 'Throughout, Aiken struggles with his desire to be seen as a viable candidate and his need to convince voters (and America) to take him seriously.'

The Democratic candidate got off to a bad start on voting day Tuesday when, after he cast his vote at Mills Park Elementary School in Cary, his tour bus stalled.

The made-for-television moment took place close to the polling station with the bus emblazoned with the slogan ‘Clay for North Carolina’ marooned in the middle of the road.

Simon Chinn, who made Man On Wire and Searching For Sugar Man, said: 'We were granted incredible access during the making of this documentary, and in turn were able to capture the internal workings of an American campaign – the good, the bad and the ugly.'

The four-hour series, yet untitled, is scheduled for early 2015 and is produced by Jonathan Chinn, Simon Chinn and Mitchell Tanen. 

Since becoming a  TV sensation 11 years ago, Aiken has enjoyed stints on Broadway in Monty Python's Spamalot and on Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice.

He also made the cover of People magazine when he announced in 2008 that he was gay.

On the campaign trail, Aiken has also managed to cause quite a stir in his first attempt at running for political office. 

'I can get people to pay attention,' said Aiken at a town hall campaign event last month. 'It's a benefit of where I came from and how I got here.' 

He had been trying to attract independent and Republican voters who recall his appearances on American Idol and had been hoping to catch breaks on the waves of unhappiness with Republican state government and gridlocked Washington politics.

'People are very dissatisfied with congress in general and getting absolutely nothing done,' said Aiken on the campaign trail.

He had accused Ellmers, a nurse, of being wrongly fixated on repealing President Obama's signature health care law, rather than fixing its problems. 

'If after three or four years, you still haven't gotten anything done, then what are you getting paid for?' he said. 

Ellmers, who like Aiken was a first-time candidate four years ago when she upset Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge, had thrown his political inexperience back at Aiken and suggested he's role-playing to win votes.

'He's an entertainer. He's an actor,' Ellmers, 50, said. 'He believes that he can change costume and get into character and speak to whichever group and win them over.'

Aiken raised more than $1 million for his campaign since February, benefiting from Broadway and Los Angeles events along the way.
