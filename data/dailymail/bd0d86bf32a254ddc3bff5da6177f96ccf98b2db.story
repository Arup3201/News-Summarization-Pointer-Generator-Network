The owner of a wedding ring recovered off the coast of Mexico has been found after a Facebook campaign led by the young man who discovered the ring.

On Saturday, Daniel Roark, 21, posted to his Facebook wall that the search he began in September had finally located the owner, Martin Castillo of Nuevo Laredo.

A commercial and recreational diver from Gloucester, Massachusetts, Roark found the gold band while diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen on the Yucatan peninsula.

Daniel Roark, who was scuba diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen in Mexico earlier this year when he found a wedding ring on the sea bed 

Found: A cousin of Jessica Garza (center) messaged Roark to tell him the ring belonged to her husband Martin Castillo, who had lost it during their honeymoon in February 2013

The ring bore an engraving with the name Jessica, as well as the date 16 02 13 and the acronym TYYJCEM.

Roark now knows that 'Jessica' is Castillo's wife Jessica Garza, and the date that of their wedding last year.

TYYJCEM likely stands for 'Tu y yo juntos contra el mundo' or 'You and I together against the world.'

The Boston Globe reports that Roark was unconvinced by a message he received Saturday morning from someone claiming to be Garza's cousin.

Roark finally got in touch with Castillo, who confirmed the details of the ring down to the size and showed Roark his wife's matching band and a receipt confirming the purchase.

Castillo had lost his band on the first day of the couple's honeymoon.

The ring slipped off his finger as Castillo and his wife were scuba diving in Barracuda Point and a five-hour search failed to turn up the piece of jewelry.

Roark, in the words of Castillo, was the couple's 'angel.'

The gold wedding band has the name Jessica engraved inside it along with the date of 16 02 13 and the letters TYYJCEM

Happy couple: Garza and Castillo said they had no idea someone was searching for them to deliver the ring that matched Garza's

Mr Roark had been scuba diving while staying at Playa Reef in the Mexican resort, pictured, when he came across the ring 

'We had no idea that someone was looking for us,' Castillo said. 'You have no idea what this means.'

Roark found the ring along a reef off the coast of Mexico, more than a year and a half after it had gone missing.

Thinking it could be a meaningful piece of jewelry, Roark started a campaign on social media to track the owner.

And now the appeal has gone viral, with his post on Facebook under the hashtag #thelostweddingband being shared over 200,000 times.

Writing on Facebook with a picture of the ring, he explained: 'Ok, so while scuba diving around Playa Reef, Playa Del Carmen last week, I happened to find this ring.'

'Unfortunately there is no way for me to know whether it was lost or intentionally thrown into the ocean.'

'Assuming it was not the latter, I'd like to find the owner so I can send it to them.'

'If you know a couple who was married on February 16th, 2013, who lost a wedding band (likely while diving) near Playa Del Carmen Mexico, please have them contact me at thelostweddingband@yahoo.com.'

'If not, please take a second to share this. Let's make some social media magic happen!' 

In another post he added: 'I'm shocked at how much support the search for the wedding band owner has received!'

The story was even shared on George Takei's Facebook wall, boost the search's signal, with Roark stating that along brought in 125,000 more shares.  

'Sadly the owner has not been found yet, but my hope for humanity was certainly restored!'

'Always remember, even in this crazy world, there are a lot of kind people.'
