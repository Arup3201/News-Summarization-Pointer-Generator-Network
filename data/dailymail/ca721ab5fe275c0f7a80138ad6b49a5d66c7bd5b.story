Mohamed Bilal, 32, was a husband and father of a two-month-old baby shot at the Brooklyn electronics store where he worked on Monday

A gunman shot and killed a computer store employee in broad daylight on Monday in an alleged dispute over a cell phone.

Mohamed Bilal, 32, was a husband and father of a two-month-old son who had moved to the U.S. to realize the 'American dream'.

Mr Bilal had yet to meet his newborn son who is with his wife of one year in Pakistan.

He was working at repair shop New Attitude in Brooklyn, New York when a unknown assailant, dressed all in black, ran into the store and shot him in the chest.

Friends say Mr Bilal was on a call with his wife when the assailant entered the store.

The gunman then took off on his bike, witnesses reported. 

Police arrived at the scene at 1.30pm shortly after the fatal shooting.

Mr Bilal was taken to Brookdale Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Employees have said that the shooting was captured on the store surveillance system.

'You know a picture tells 1,000 words? So we got those 1,000 words,' a co-worker identified only as Mister Pratt said to CBS New York.

Pratt also told police the shooting may have been over a cellphone.

Mr Bilal's cousin Jabeen Ahmed revealed that he had never met his own son before his death. His wife and son are living in Pakistan.

'It's just heartbreaking,' Ahmed told CBS
New York. 'He was such a gentle person that his mother and his father 
are going to be heartbroken back home,” Ahmed said. 'His first 
anniversary is going to be next week.'

'American dream, you know,' friend Mohammed Usman said to NBC New York. 'He was really working hard.'

Police in Brooklyn say there are following a 'strong lead' in the hunt for Mr Bilal's killer.

No further information was released about the suspect. Nothing was taken from the store.

'The individual may have been in the store before and may have had family members that have gone in the store before,' Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told NY1.

Bilal was shot Monday afternoon while working at New Attitude on New Lots Avenue, in Brooklyn, NY. He never met his two-month-old son, living in Pakistan, seen here
