Roberto Martinez insists Ross Barkley is lucky his season is not over as he begins his recovery from knee-ligament damage.

Barkley will miss the next eight weeks following a training ground collision with Gareth Barry.

The 20-year-old has his knee in a protective brace but Martinez believes he can be thankful he is not awaiting an operation.

Big blow: Martinez will be without 20-year-old Barkley for eight weeks because of a knee injury

‘I’ve seen that situation cause an injury that is a full rupture, which then requires surgery and is a far more serious injury. Ross only has a partial tear,’ he said.

‘He is fortunate really, yes, it could have been a lot worse. If that action happened earlier in pre-season it would have been a full rupture.

‘It is a big blow. Ross is not replaceable.’
