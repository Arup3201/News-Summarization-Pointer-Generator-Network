Sam Allardyce insists Andy Carroll’s return to fitness will not result in West Ham resorting to long-ball tactics.

Carroll could make his first start of the season against Everton on Saturday after recovering from an ankle injury sustained in pre-season.

West Ham striker Andy Carroll has only made one brief substitute appearance this season

The loss of the target man was viewed as a huge blow ahead of the season, but Diafra Sakho’s prolific form has helped West Ham cope without Carroll.

Sakho is struggling with a back injury and that could open the door for 6ft 4in Carroll to return.

But Allardyce insists the England striker’s selection would not signal an aerial attack.

Carroll's last goal for West Ham was in the 3-1 victory over Sunderland last season

‘We play slightly different in that we play more into Andy’s feet than we do into [Enner] Valencia or Sakho,’ said Allardyce.

‘Valencia and Sakho are so pacy we are a massive threat in behind the opposition when the midfield players like Mark Noble, Alex Song or Stewart Downing start sliding balls down the side of defenders.

‘Andy is not such a big threat in that area, he is a much bigger threat in terms of setting up attacks to get into the final third by playing into his feet or chest and not playing into his head.

‘No way do I tell a player to just knock it up to Andy’s head. I want them to be talented enough to knock it into Andy’s feet or chest. We want it on Andy’s head when it is crossed into the box because that is where he is at his best and where he can score.’
