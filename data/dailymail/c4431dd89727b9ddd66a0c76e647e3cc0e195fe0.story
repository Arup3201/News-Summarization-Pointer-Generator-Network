Jeremy Paxman has announced he is quitting the flagship current affairs show Newsnight saying he wants to 'go to bed at much the same time as most people'.

The broadcaster, one of the most familiar faces on the BBC2 show, is one of the corporation's biggest stars.

In a statement, he said: 'I have decided it is time to move on from Newsnight. After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.

Veteran: Paxman, pictured left in on Newsnight in 1990, and right on the programme this year, 
decided to leave last July

'This was a decision I reached - and 
informed the BBC of - last July. I shall work out the remainder of my 
contract and will not seek another.

'It's
 been fun. I have had the pleasure of working with lots of clever, 
creative and amusing people. I think I've been lucky and wish the 
programme well.'

The BBC said Paxman, who has been on Newsnight for a quarter of a century, agreed to stay to help its new editor 'following a difficult period' which saw the show lambasted after it pulled a planned expose of Jimmy Savile's sex crimes.

Paxman's resignation comes two weeks after he was scolded by the boss of Radio 1

The flagship show has also seen a ratings decline in recent years.

A
 corporation spokeswoman said: 'The BBC is immensely grateful for this 
gesture, which is entirely in keeping with his outstanding contribution 
to both Newsnight and, over four decades, the BBC itself.'

He will present his last show in June and continue to host quiz show University Challenge.

Director-general
 Tony Hall said: 'This is a particularly poignant moment for me, because
 I have known Jeremy and relished working with him, since the day I 
joined the BBC in 1973.

And I am therefore better placed than most to 
know what a remarkable job he has done at Newsnight.

'His is a rare and dazzling talent. He
 has a unique ability to create moments of real discomfort for 
politicians and memorable delight for audiences.

For that cussed 
brilliance and much more besides, the BBC and our audiences will always 
be in his debt.'

The BBC's director of news, James Harding, said Paxman was the 'great lion of BBC journalism'.

He
 said: 'We accept his decision to move on but I think it is fair to say 
that the only people really celebrating his decision will be the 
politicians and public figures he has so often and so brilliantly held 
to account.'

The show's new 
editor, Ian Katz, said it had been 'a huge privilege' to work with 
Paxman and said he was 'deeply grateful' to him for agreeing to stay on.

It 
comes two weeks after Paxman was scolded by the boss of Radio 1 after 
claiming the station's music made travelling in BBC lifts 'hell'.

The
 Newsnight presenter was told he should 'take the stairs' if he did not 
like tunes from the youth music station piped into elevators.

Paxman is also a long-time presenter of the BBC's University Challenge programme

In
 a terse email fired off by Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper, the 
63-year-old was also asked to keep his outspoken views under control.

The
 row came after Paxman launched an astonishing attack on the BBC this 
week, calling his employer 'smug', criticising the payoff scandal and 
claiming it 'distorts the marketplace' with its news operation.

He said: 'There's a pile of stuff on the BBC I can't stand. My idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1Xtra plumbed into it. I don't quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1Xtra.

'I don't really understand why it does Radio 1. Clearly, you can meet those needs commercially.'

However, Mr Cooper defended his stations and said the BBC's commercial rivals are unable to provide a comparable service.

A close shave: Paxman's beard was the subject of much speculation last year. He later ditched it

He said: 'Commercial radio targeted at young listeners does not win awards for documentaries about domestic abuse in teenage relationships, it does not have two 15-minute news programmes in its daytime output listened to by more young people than watch the  10 O'Clock News, and it does not play 65 hours of specialist music  a week.'

He added: 'If the licence fee is collected from everyone, then the BBC should represent the whole of society, not just certain parts of it.'

In January, Paxman admitted that Newsnight 
viewers would sometimes do better to turn off the television and go to 
bed rather than watch the programme.

The
 anchor revealed that on some nights 
he wanted to say, 'Not much happened today' - but added that he would 
feel guilty about betraying his colleagues if he did so.

Last month, Newsnight editor Ian Katz was forced to defend
 his controversial appointment of a new economics correspondent, insisting he was the 
‘most suitable candidate’ for the job.

Duncan
 Weldon, who started work with the flagship BBC show this month, came
 under fire for his strong links to the Left and the trade unions 
movement, as well as a youthful flirtation with the far Right.

1. Paxman’s most notorious interview in May 1997. The Conservative former Home Secretary Michael Howard was asked the same question 12 times by the persistent Newsnight host in the wake of breakout at Parkhurst prison.

2.  Described as car-crash television, hapless Treasury minister Chloe Smith was wheeled out in June 2012 to defend George 
Osborne's U-turn on plans to increase fuel duty. She was faced with a 
furious Paxman.

3. Paxman clashes with London Mayor Boris Johnson over the BBC presenter’s reputed £1million wages. When Paxman appeared to scoff at the fact that Conservative leader David Cameron had been a 'PR man', Johnson hit back. He said: 'You chose to be a journalist. Why don't you get yourself a proper job? Instead of sitting around telling politicians what to do the whole time.'

4. A highlight of the BBC's 2005 general election coverage was Paxman's bat-tempered tussle with George Galloway. Paxman's encounter with Mr Galloway in the early hours of Friday May 6, following the latter's shock victory over Labour's Oona King in Bethnal Green and Bow, became one of the main talking points of the night after the victorious Respect candidate ripped off his microphone and stormed out of the interview.

5. The usually combative SNP leader Alex Salmond got unusually tongue-tied during this face-off with the Newsnight anchor in January 2012.

6. Paxman took on American right-winger Ann Coulter in 2006 - and got more than he bargained for.

7. London mayoral candidate Brian Paddick ran into Paxman during an election debate and the pair clashed.
