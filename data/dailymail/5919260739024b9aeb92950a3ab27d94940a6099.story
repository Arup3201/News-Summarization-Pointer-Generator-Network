Painful: Prime Minister David Cameron has been suffering from backache

David Cameron has injured his back, forcing him to cancel plans to hunt deer during his Scottish holiday.

The Prime Minister has had a painkilling injection after suffering a protruding disc in his spine.

In an interview on the remote Hebridean island of Jura, where Mr Cameron and his family were on their third summer holiday, he said his ‘phenomenally bad back’ had been a ‘bore’.

It has stopped him from doing his favourite activities including stalking deer – which involves crawling through the heather rifle in hand – and waterskiing.

Mr Cameron, who was once credited with killing two stags with one shot, denied that he had given up deer-stalking to placate animal rights groups, calling it ‘probably one of the most defendable’ field sports.

But said he was unable to do it on Jura, where he was staying on a 20,000-acre estate owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Lord Astor.

‘I’ve got a phenomenally bad back so I don’t really think I’ll be able to crawl,’ he said

The interview was apparently designed to show a Prime Minister at ease with himself.

But Tory MPs privately expressed concerns that openly discussing his interests in hunting, riding and fishing would do little to combat the charge from some critics that he is out of touch with ordinary voters.

‘Another masterstroke from the man of the people,’ one MP remarked.

Mr Cameron left Jura yesterday, after the interview, and travelled to Oxford for treatment.

The Prime Minister tweeted: ‘I’ve been treated for a bad back/protruding disc at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre today. The staff say all will be back to normal very soon.’

The Camerons then journeyed on to Cornwall for the final leg of their holiday.

Aides said no specific incident had caused Mr Cameron’s bad back but that it had ‘developed over time’.

Mr Cameron, 46, said: ‘When you get into your mid-40s stuff like this starts to happen.’

In the interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Cameron said he enjoys activity-based holidays.

He joked that he liked horse-riding but ‘not bare-chested’ like Russian premier Vladimir Putin. ‘I walk, I like fishing, I like going for a run.

'I’ve caught some sea trout here but we’re not talking Moby Dick,’ he said, adding that he occasionally swims in the sea while in Scotland.

‘It’s not actually as cold as some people think. But when you get out you need to get in a hot bath pretty quick.’

The Prime Minister said he is still ‘effectively in charge’ of the UK while on holiday – even in the remoteness of Jura.

‘I always think that you’ve got to be in contact, you are effectively still in charge,’ he said.

‘I check my BlackBerry, I contact the office, but I can do that and then say, “It’s holiday time, it’s children time”.’
