Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber has hit back at United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann for claiming that his star players could suffer a drop in form by playing in the North American league

While MLS has trumpeted the return of leading US players such as Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley as a sign of the league's rise, Klinsmann said this week that players returning from Europe risked a drop in form.

'Jurgen's comments are very, very detrimental to the league, to the sport of soccer in North America ... they are wrong,' Garber said.

An animated Garber said Klinsmann's words, which were made on Monday, undermined the work that MLS and the US Soccer Federation were doing to develop the game.

'I believe it sends the wrong message to other young American players that we collectively - the league and federation - want to have in Major League Soccer so that we can develop the game and the league,' he said.

Garber said he sent a 'very strong letter' to US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati and that MLS club owners had done the same independently.

Klinsmann had expressed concerns that Bradley, who moved from Roma to Toronto, and Dempsey, who left Tottenham for Seattle Sounders, could suffer a drop in form.

'There's nothing I can do about it. I made it clear with Clint's move back and Michael's move back that it's going to be very difficult to keep the same level that they experienced at the places where they were,' said Klinsmann. 'It's just reality. It's just being honest.' 

Garber also criticised the coach for not taking Landon Donovan to the World Cup.

Donovan, 32, the all-time top scorer for the national team and MLS, was dropped by Klinsmann in May and denied a trip to a fourth World Cup.

'I believe that Landon should have been in Brazil, not because he earned it or deserved it, but because his performance dictated it,' Garber said.

'And if anybody disagrees with that, and some of you might - clearly Jurgen does - then I believe that his treatment was inexcusable.'

Klinsmann, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990 and coach of the German team that reached the 2006 semi-finals, was hired in July 2011 to replace Bob Bradley. 

He guided the United States to the title at the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil, where the US lost 2-1 to Belgium in extra time.
