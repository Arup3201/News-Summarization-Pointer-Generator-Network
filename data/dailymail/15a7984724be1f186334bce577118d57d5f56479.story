Nearly a year to the day after Long Island college student Andrea Rebello was accidentally killed by police during a hostage crisis, her twin sister Jessica ascended the stage at Hofstra University Sunday to accept her diploma wearing a cap honoring the slain woman.

Just hours before Sunday’s graduation ceremony, Jessica Rebello, 22, shared a snapshot of her homemade tribute on her Instagram account, showing the top of the graduation cap with her sister's purple initials, ‘AR,’ with a pair of white wings sprouting from the sides of the letters, a golden halo crowing the ‘A’ and a pair of hearts.

Beneath the initials, Jessica laid out the name of their sorority, Beta Sigma Phi, and wrote on the other side of the mortarboard: 'always & forever.'

Touching tribute: Jessica Rebello shared a photo on her Instagram showing her graduation cap decorated with the initially of her sister, Andrea, who was accidentally shot by police a year ago

Bittersweet moment: Jessica Rebello took the stage at Hofstra University and got a kiss on the cheek from President Stuart Rabinowitz before accepting her diploma a day after the one-year anniversary of her sister's killing

Momentous occasion: Ms Rebello was on hand for the commencement ceremony Sunday, graduating with a bachelor's degree in public relations

Ms Rebello accompanied the picture by the following caption: 'I don't know how I did it... but I did it... for you- ilu &miss you, always &forever... until we meet again Twinnie...'

In the early hours of May 17, 2013, Andrea Rebello was in her Uniondale home, which she shared with her sister and two other roommates, when 30-year-old Dalton Smith, a convicted felon wanted for violating the conditions of his parole, forced his way in looking for money and got the 21-year-old in a chokehold.

One of two Nassau County police officers who responded to the hostage situation heard Smith repeating the words, 'I'm going to kill her,' and then saw him pointing his 9mm gun at the cops.

Crisis: Dalton, Smith, 30 (left), a convicted felon, was fatally shot by police seven times while holding Andrea Rebello (right) in a choke-hold, but the eight bullet struck the hostage in the head

Crime scene: The Nassau County prosecutor ruled last month that the responding officer had no choice but to use deadly force in response to the home invasion in Uniondale

The officer, Nikolas Budimlic, opened fire striking the intruder seven times, but the eighth bullet hit Andrea Rebello in the head, killing her on the spot. 

On Sunday, one day after the first anniversary of her twin sister's killing, Jessica Rebello graduated with a bachelor's degree in public relations from Hofstra’s Lawrence Herbert School of Communication, when Andrea studied as well, Newsday reported. 

On her way to receive her diploma, Jessica was greeted by Hofstra President Stuart Rabinowitz, who exchanged a few quiet words with her and gave her a kiss on the cheek.

Rebello's faculty adviser also gave the graduate a hug.

Legal action: The twins' family filed a wrongful death lawsuit last week against Nassau County and its police force

The commencement ceremony came just days after the Rebello family filed a wrongful- death lawsuit against Nassau County and its police department, claiming that Officer Budimlic 'carelessly discharged his pistol' and 'recklessly and unnecessarily endangered' Andrea's life. 

The county prosecutor ruled last month that officer Nikolas Budimlic, an eight-year veteran of Nassau police, had no option but deadly force on the armed convicted felon.

District Attorney Kathleen Rice concluded the 21-year-old Rebello's death was caused by a gunman breaking into her Hempstead residence with a gun, taking several residents hostage and refusing to surrender to police.

Officer Budimlic ‘acted accordingly’ when he opened fire, killing not only the armed suspect but 21-year-old Andrea Rebello in May 2013, at an off-campus New York house, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced Wednesday following an 11-month investigation.
