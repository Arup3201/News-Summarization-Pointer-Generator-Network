As Gareth Bale's season at Real Madrid continues to turn sour, the former Tottenham forward is continually being linked with a move away from the Bernabeu.

Manchester United and Chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world's most expensive player back to the Premier League.

Sportsmail asked Chelsea fan Cody Taylor of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to the champions elect.

Gareth Bale could be available this summer if various transfer reports are to be believed, so naturally Chelsea are being linked with an eye-watering bid - but we have to ask ourselves the question, is he necessary?

On the face of it Bale is a good player. At Tottenham he dragged an average team out of hole after hole, but it's easy to be a big fish in small pond. As he's found out in Spain it's much harder in the big pond and that's what it will be like at Chelsea too.

Overall he's not had the impact that the world's most expensive player should. There are plenty who would give up everything to have him, but we really don't need to be wasting time on a player that won't be a noticeable improvement, or even fit.

Even with his array of qualities, for the money, Bale just isn't worth it. As good a player as he is, he wasn't worth the world record £86m Real paid for him in 2013, after what was effectively only one explosive season. He still isn't worth the £75m that the Spanish giants will allegedly settle for now.

There's simply no room for him at Chelsea. Jose Mourinho already has a plethora of young, similarly able attacking players. Willian is not as glamorous as the rest, but even he is a crucial part of the team and the fans love him. 

The Brazilian doesn't score as many goals or provide as many assists as others, but he is the one above all else that never stops working hard and that type of attitude and passion is more important than everything.

If Bale arrives he is unlikely to do the same and it would negatively change the whole balance of the side which Mourinho has worked hard to build.

There is also Juan Cuadrado to think about. The Colombian hasn't shown anything like his best since arriving in January and isn't likely to before the end of the season. 

He is still settling in and just needs a bit more time before fans will eventually see the player that lit up last summer's World Cup. There's absolutely no point replacing someone before they've even started.

Even just a few games away from claiming a well-deserved Premier League title though, any Chelsea fan claiming there is no need to improve with summer additions is a fool. The season has been far from flawless, but the key areas that need strengthening are defensive.

If big money is to be spent it has to be used to address real issues, not bringing in additional unnecessary luxury. We are more in need of a centre-back, maybe a full-back, Paul Pogba even, but certainly not Bale.

Mourinho has the good sense to see that and Bale in blue is highly unlikely. Besides, if he has any ambition to show himself to be anything other a massive flop, he should reject all offers and do his utmost to prove himself in Spain.
