At first glance, these two images of the Thames, with the Houses of Parliament in the background, could be taken on the same day.

But now compare them with another split image of the river - one showing a woman from the present day, the other showing a policeman from yesteryear.

These remarkable pictures are actually stills from a film, illustrating a shot-by-shot comparison of London now and in 1927.

It was 86 years ago that Claude Friese-Greene - a cinema technician, filmmaker and cinematographer - travelled across the UK with a new colour film camera to create his famous collection of films, The Open Road.

These two images of the Thames look almost identical... but they were shot 86 years apart - the one on the left in 1927

Separated by the years, two toddlers pose next to a Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens. In early 2013, another filmmaker, Simon Smith, armed with his own camera, followed in the footsteps of Friese-Greene to make his own film

The filmmaker's trip culminated in London with scenes that captured the daily life of Londoners as well as several iconic cityscapes, such as Hyde Park, Marble Arch and Petticoat Lane.

Some of the original silent film's title cards will seem rather old-fashioned, and just a tad chauvinist to the modern viewer.

One of them reads: 'Now a little contrast, from the peace of the park to Peticoat Lane - where London's husbands amuse themselves while London's wives cook the Sunday dinner.'

Fast forward to early 2013, and another filmmaker, Simon Smith, armed with his own camera, followed in the footsteps of Friese-Greene to make his own film.Â 

The result is uncanny.

Over
 six months, Smith matched the original films shot by shot, mimicking 
the timing and angle almost perfectly for nearly six minutes of footage.

While the differences between London of 
1927 and 2013 are easy to spot when viewing the films side-by-side, 
what's more amazing are the similarities.

And though the clothing styles and car designs have changed, it's almost impossible to tell some of the shots apart if it weren't for the quality of the film.

It was not until 1967 that the BBC brought colour to television screens, so Friese-Greene's film - the property of the BFI - was a pioneering achievement.

Claude Friese-Greene died in 1943 at the age of 44.

He and his father, William Friese-Greene, developed an early colour process that was very effective but proved too costly for commercial use

The video slowly travels over London Bridge, showing motor buses, and panning over to Tower Bridge, where dozens of boats can be seen moored on the Thames or lazily drifting down the river
