Fancy dress-loving Samantha Humphreys is wearing her favourite 30 outfits and costumes each day before turning 30 - when, she says, she finally has to grow up.

Samantha is dressing as a different fancy dress character for the last 30 days that she's still in her twenties.

The careers advisor is living the dream as Madonna, Tinkerbell, Dorothy from Wizard of Oz, a Playboy bunny and Minnie Mouse.

And she's also been Scooby Doo, Rudolph, Ironman, Morticia Addams and a pirate before hitting the big Three-O.

She said: 'I love dressing up - this is perfect for me. Because it's coming up to my 30th, everyone was asking me what I wanted or what I was doing.

'I just thought I want to do something different, not what everyone else does.'

She is borrowing and hiring some of the fancy dress outfits, and even pulling some together herself from her wardrobe before turning 30 on April 12.

Samantha, of Neath, South Wales, is asking for sponsorship for her fancy dress countdown to 30 - with all funds raised going to children's cancer charity Clic Sargent.

She set herself a £300 target - and is more than half way there.

She said: 'Even if someone wants to donate the price of a birthday card, that's enough. I dare say I'll have to be more sensible when I'm 30.

'The charity does a fantastic job supporting children with cancer,' she said of her chosen cause.
