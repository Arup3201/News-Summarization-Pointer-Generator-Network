The ability to show kindness to animals is known to be a sign of good character.

And the man in this video proves himself to be a decent guy - after rescuing a squirrel from a dog. 

William Benton, from Alfreton in Derbyshire, is seen lifting up the frightened animal after he witnesses his pet pooch trying to pick up the tiny mammal. 

Distressed: Mr Benton found the baby squirrel who was the source of unwanted attention from a dog

During the video, Mr Benton rubs the squirrel and comforts it while keeping a close watch over his dog which attempts to bite the baby squirrel.

During the video Mr Benton can be heard saying: 'I won't hurt it, I'll try and see if I can get it to go up the tree.'

Moments later the dog tries to get close to the squirrel and the man says: 'No, leave it, don't dare touch it. Hey, don't dare bite it.'

Cute: Mr Benton places the baby squirrel on a rug as he comforts it and looks after it

Mr Benton then brings the baby squirrel to a tree and he encourages it to run up the tree

Shortly afterwards Mr Benton can be seen comforting the squirrel once again and he then places it on the tree. He says: 'It's nice that is, it's a nice little squirrel.'  

Mr Benton then places the squirrel on a tree trunk, telling it: 'Go on up, you're not very old are you? That's it you go climb up there. Go a bit further, go and find mum.'

Thankfully the squirrel makes a full recovery and at the end of the footage it can be seen crawling slowly up the tree.
