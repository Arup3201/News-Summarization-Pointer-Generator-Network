When police officers pulled over 23-year-old Warren Thomas Michael on Saturday night for erratic driving they found him to be red eyed, slurring his words and holding an angry squirrel.

Instead of handing over his licence and registration to the Clay County sheriff's deputy in Florida, Michael wound down his window to explain that he was in a bind and that 'he had a squirrel eating him.'

Detecting the strong smell of alcohol from Michael, the officer wrote in his report that 'I had the defendant secure the squirrel and then exit the vehicle,' after which he ran Michael through a series of tests to work out how drunk he was.

Warren Thomas Michael was charged with Driving Under the Influence after sheriff's deputies in Florida pulled him over after they witnessed him driving erratically - he blamed his pet squirrel DUI

Initially, the deputies witnessed Michael swerving across the lanes of Highway 17 on Fleming Island, caught up to him and pulled him over to ask him for identification.

Walking to the drivers side to meet Michael, the officer didn't even have the chance to him for his ID as the report states, 'Upon contact with the defendant, he immediately told me he had a squirrel eating him.'

DUI the squirrel is owned by Warren Thomas Michael and his girlfriend Alexandra Rock and was blamed by Michael for his bad driving on Saturday- even though the cause was his intoxication

Warren Thomas Michael found DUI as a stray and brought him into his house and also to the bar in Florida where he was drinking before being pulled over by sheriff's deputies on Saturday

The report from the on goes on to say, that 'After some discussion about the squirrel I introduced myself and explained the reason for the stop.'

After Michael left the car, he was put through his paces on several field sobriety tests, failing all of them.

According to the arrest report, he could not divide his attention between looking for the items that the officer needed such as ID and answering questions about his name and birth date.

'I believed the defendant was impaired,' indicates the Clay County deputy's report.

'I had the defendant secure the squirrel and then exit his vehicle.

'I had the defendant stand behind his vehicle while I checked his information through NCIC.

'I watched the defendant as he had a slight sway while standing without holding onto anything.'

When Michael had failed his sobriety tests he was breathalysed, registering samples of .145 and .156, which is nearly twice Florida's legal limit to drive of .08.

After Michael was informed he was going to be arrested for Driving Under the Influence by the officer, he was allowed to call his girlfriend, Alexandra Rock who arrived on the scene to berate her boyfriend and pick up their squirrel, who they have now named DUI.

Asked about the incident when local news caught up with him, Michael said he was worried about his pet when the police officer pulled him over on Saturday.

'The police officer considered calling animal control,' said Michael to News4Jax.

'DUI was tired and resting in my shirt nibbling at me and I guess she just moved a whole bunch and I wasn't ready for it.

'She is very friendly.'

'I have learned from this to not to drink and drive.'
