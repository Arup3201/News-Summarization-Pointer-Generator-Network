Perhaps it’s because many of us watched the Disney classic Dumbo as a child that we all 
seem to have a special place in our hearts for elephants, 
especially baby ones.

That’s what makes this latest video 
from elephant research and conservation project Amboseli Trust for 
Elephants - which has now started to trend on the internet - so special.

An eight-month-old calf became stuck 
in a shallow well in the parched grounds of Amboseli national park in Kenya - while its increasingly anxious mother, Zombe, looked on, powerless to help.

VIDEO: Mother elephant is kept away from scene as rescuers battle to save calf...

The baby's increasingly anxious mother, Zombe, looked on, powerless to help

Luckily, the Trust got word of 
the incident in the Rift Valley Province earlier this week and sent two jeeps to assist.

The rescue operation began early in the morning - before the mother would have been forced to leave by herders who would soon arrive to water their cattle.

At first, the team struggled to attach a rope around the calf in the 5ft-deep hole as the low-lying water caused the cord to float to the surface.

Finally, they managed to secure it and, with the other end of the rope attached to a jeep, hauled the animal to safety.

What followed was truly tearjerking.

The calf thundered across the barren plain, leaving a trail of dust in its wake.

In the distance, the cries of Zombe could be heard as she came running in the opposite direction.

And then they were reunited, embracing each other with their trunks.

They then turned to the camera, perhaps as a sign of gratitude to the little one's saviours.
