A mother has lost more than eight stone after an embarrassing picture of her in a Christmas costume motivated her to give up sugary snacks and junk food.

Sarah Whitaker, 32, from Swindon, weighed 23st 6lbs and wore a dress size 26, but after being confronted with the unflattering photograph, she decided she had to change her unhealthy lifestyle.

After radically overhauling her diet and joining a boot camp she lost an incredible 8st 1lb in just one year, taking her down to a more healthy 15st 5lb and dress size 14.

'I realised that someone who looked like I did couldn't be healthy and I knew I had to do something about it,' said Sarah.

'I was active as a teenager but from the age of 16 I began to put weight on. I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries at 18, which meant I had a hormone imbalance,' said Sarah, an administrator at a plumbing company.

'I also had a weakness for takeaways such as fish and chips.'

Sarah married her husband Mathew, 32, a plumber, in June 2009.

When she fell pregnant with her daughter Rosie-May in February 2009, she weighed 20st, and following her daughter's birth that November, she quickly put on weight.

Around the time of Rosie-May's first birthday, doctors were warning Sarah that she faced a lifetime of health difficulties if she did not bring her obesity under control.

'I really struggled with it. I tried dieting on my own, and then with a slimming club, but I never got anywhere,' she said.

'I was on my way to diabetes and heart issues. It was shocking to hear I would have life-threatening problems, especially when I thought about my daughter growing up without me.' 

Photographs taken of her over the Christmas period in 2011, including a picture of her in a Santa Claus costume for her husband's 30th birthday party in November, were to change her life forever.

She was by then the heaviest she had ever been - tipping the scales at 23st 6lbs. 

'I saw the photograph of me in the Santa outfit for the first time the day after Mathew's party. I was shocked,' she said.

'Then another photo was taken of me at New Years Eve which really upset me. I contacted my friend, who runs a weight-loss boot camp almost immediately.

'The photos were a powerful catalyst. I thought, "I'm going to end up dying prematurely if I carry on like this". I didn't look healthy - I looked like a ticking time bomb.'

Starting in January 2012, Sarah began exercising three times a week at NKD Fitness in Swindon, including intensive programmes of push-ups, lunges and burpees. 

'I couldn't even walk after the first session, but I forced myself to go back to the class the next day. My fitness levels improved at an amazing rate,' she said.

By the end of the first month Sarah had lost a whole stone in weight and by January 2013 she had lost 100lb. She now weighs 15st 5lb - a total loss of 8st 1lb - and can slip into a size 14.

Alongside her new fitness regime, Sarah was determined to completely overhaul her diet. 

Before embarking on her new healthier life, she typically ate toast and sugary cereal for breakfast followed by a cheese and coleslaw sandwich with crisps and a chocolate bar for lunch, and pizza and chips for dinner.

Today, she enjoys a much more nutritious diet including omelette for breakfast, chicken salad for lunch, and a home-made curry for her evening meal. Sarah is very careful about nutrition for her whole family and makes sure Rosie-May enjoys healthy meals too. Her home life has been completely transformed by her weight loss journey.

While she is overjoyed with her achievements so far, Sarah would like to lose more weight and get to a comfortable size 12.

Sarah now leads her own boot camp fitness groups, passing on her enthusiasm for healthy living which led to her amazing weight loss.

But she said the biggest benefit has come from being able to keep up with her four-year-old daughter.

She said: 'It's nice to go the park and do things with her. We went on holiday this year and I was able to go on the waterslides with her. She laughed when she saw me go down the slide, which was a simply wonderful thing to hear.

'I'm so glad I don't have to sit on the sidelines any more.

'Mathew was really supportive when I 
decided to lose weight and he's been very impressed by what I've managed
 to achieve. I feel like a new person.'
