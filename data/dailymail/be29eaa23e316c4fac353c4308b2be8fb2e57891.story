Income tax could be increased by a Labour government to fund other tax cuts, a member of Ed Miliband’s treasury team has revealed.

In remarks which will risk being seen as a Labour tax bombshell, Catherine McKinnell told delegates at the party's conference that a policy review would consider a hike in direct taxes to shift the burden away from indirect charges like VAT.

And in another shock move, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne today suggested universal benefits like bus passes, TV licences and heating allowances for wealthy pensioners could also be axed.

Ed Miliband's speech risks being oversshadowed by his frontbench floating ideas based on Ed Ball's 'zero-based spending review'

Both ideas emerged from discussions of Ed Balls’ announcement of a  ‘zero-based spending review' that will look at every pound spent by government.

But the prospect of tax rises and benefit cuts could overshadow Ed Milliband’s keynote speech at the Labour conference in Manchester today, where he hopes to portray himself as in touch with voters’ concerns.

Stung by criticism of a lack of policies, he will announce a series of education and economic reforms designed to present Labour as a credible alternative government.

However, policy kite-flying by two shadow ministers risks undermining Mr Miliband’s relaunch.

Ms McKinnell, who was promoted to the Treasury team in May, insisted nothing on tax policy was ‘set in stone’ and signalled that the burden of VAT, which Labour has long called to be reduced, could be cut if income tax rates went up.

Asked if the balance between direct and indirect taxation would be looked at by Labour, she said: ‘Yes is the simple answer.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne today said the balance between between universal benefits and targeted benefits has 'got to be looked at'

‘In this economic climate, I don’t think anything is set in stone any more.

'I think everything needs to be looked at and everything needs to be considered and everything needs to be reviewed,’ she told a PoliticsHome fringe event.

Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday it was too early to make promises on tax: ‘We cannot make any commitments now that the next Labour government will be able to reverse particular tax rises or spending cuts.

‘Because, unlike Nick Clegg, we will not make promises we cannot keep.’

But he criticised Mr Osborne’s aborted VAT hike on pasties and caravans and later called for VAT to be cut to five per cent for a year on home improvements.

Today Treasury ministers said Labour's existing proposal for a reduction in VAT from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent would cost £12.5 billion this year.

Sajid Javid, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Labour have let the cat out of the bag – if elected, their plans mean a £500 tax bombshell for every person who works hard and wants to get on in life.

'Labour isn't learning. They still stand for more borrowing and more debt - and higher taxes.'

Later a Labour spokesman said: 'Catherine was stating the obvious. Of course we will have to consider what we say in our manifesto on tax after this government has raised VAT, put up taxes for pensioners and cut the top rate of tax for the very richest.'

Today Mr Byrne, who famously left a note in the Treasury joking that there was ‘no money left’, indicated that Labour would also re-examine universal benefits for pensioners.

‘There’s always been a balance in the welfare state between universal benefits and targeted benefits, and I’m afraid that as part of Ed’s zero-based review, that balance has got to be looked at,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Labour strategists were quick to play down the significance of the remarks, and insisted Mr Miliband would not be touching on universal benefits in today’s speech.

Mr Byrne added: “I work on the assumption that we’re going to inherit a dog’s breakfast in 2015, the national debt’s going to be over £400bn higher than it was at the last Parliament. 

‘Savings are going to have to be made and I think there will be savings that are needed on welfare spending too. And our challenge is how we spend that money differently to support more people.’
