'Then one day we had a had a bucket in the yard and once Charcoal started playing with it he always preferred buckets to other toys.

'He plays with buckets for around three hours a day and the first thing he does when he goes outside is runs towards a bucket.

'Charcoal has gone through around 100 buckets but we found a place where we can buy them wholesale.

'We strip them down, taking off the handles and bottoms so he can play with them.

'My mum talked about wanting a video to remember him by and we agreed the world needs to know how awesome Charcoal is playing with his bucket.'
