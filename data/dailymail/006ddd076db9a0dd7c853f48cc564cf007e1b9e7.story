Win: David Cameron, pictured arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, was confident of securing a deal to protect Britain's rebate

David Cameron scored a vital victory for taxpayers last night as he protected Britain’s £3.1billion EU rebate.

The Prime Minister fought off a raid by France on the UK’s annual clawback of funding from Brussels.

Paris said Britain’s refund should not be exempt from a deal to hand over £300million a year in taxpayer-funded farming subsidies for new member states.

In a second victory for Mr Cameron, MEPs also backed down and agreed to the first ever EU budget reduction in its 56-year history.

They will vote on the £30billion cut to £770billion next week.

Mr Cameron blocked the refund raid after talks with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy ahead of the EU summit in Brussels.

Exemption from the farming subsidy deal was a key part of the UK’s rebate settlement, agreed at landmark talks in February, but it has come under increasing attack from France.

Mr Cameron said details should now be ‘locked down’ in EU law.

A Downing Street source later said there were ‘assurances’ that Brussels will stick to February’s deal.

The rebate was won for Britain by Baroness Thatcher in 1984 after her ‘handbagging’ of European leaders and her vow of ‘not a penny more’ for Brussels.

The refund was granted because Britain get disproportionately less in farm subsidies than France.

As he went into the meeting Mr Cameron said: 'It is absolutely essential that we stick to the deal we reached in February and that we protect the British rebate, and I will make sure that we do that.'

A Downing Street source said afterwards: 'We have assurances from Mr Van Rompuy that we will stick to the deal done in February. We are confident this is resolved now.'

Mr Cameron added: 'This council should be about doing in Brussels what we are doing in Britain, which is getting control of spending, making sure we live within our means, and then making ourselves more competitive, getting rid of regulations, making it easier for businesses to create jobs.'

But despite reductions in some areas of spending such as regional aid, the cost of running the EU civil service, assembly and quangos will still rise by 1.7 per cent.

And spending on the pensions of Brussels bureaucrats will rise by 7.2 per cent partly because of costs associated with an increase in officials taking early retirement.

Martin Callanan MEP, the leader of the European Conservatives, said: 'This is an historic cut but we still have enormous amounts of fat that can be trimmed.

'Administration is normally the first thing to be cut in any government’s budget. Only in the EU would it increase at a time of belt-tightening.'

Jobs: Mr Cameron is calling for rules to be relaxed to encourage firms to take on young people

The Prime Minister celebrated a major
diplomatic coup in Brussels in February after securing the first EU 
spending cut in its history.

But four months on, Francois Hollande's government launched a last-ditch attempt to slash Britain’s rebate.

After talks with European Council president Herman Van Rompuy, Mr Cameron insisted the deal still stands.

Under the agreement every other country with rebates had to agree to give up some of the money.

Diplomats hailed it as the biggest 
British triumph for the UK in an EU negotiation since the rebate was won
by Margaret Thatcher at the Fontainebleau summit almost 30 years ago.

Mr Cameron’s deal will save UK 
taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds on what  they would have been 
forced to pay under the European Commission’s initial plans to increase 
the budget.

The Prime Minister arrived at a summit in Brussels insisting he would block any attempt to reduce the rebate.

Mr Van Rompuy has declared improving the job prospects of young people the main theme for the two-day gathering.

Battle: The Prime Minister insisted it was 'essential' that the British rebate remained protected

Some 5.6 million are out of work in the eurozone, and in Greece and Spain the youth unemployment rate has rocketed to over 50 per cent.

Mr Van Rompuy is emphasising the need for money to be pumped into projects that could boost their employment chances.

But Mr Cameron is due to argue that loosening labour market rules and freeing up small and medium companies to take on young staff is more important.

He has staked Britain's continuing membership of the EU on his ability to negotiate fundamental reform of it - with an in-out referendum due to be held in 2017 if the Tories win the general election.

Mr Cameron could also face questions from German chancellor Angela Merkel and others after it emerged that eavesdropping agency GCHQ has been mass-monitoring global phone and internet traffic.

Berlin has openly challenged the validity of the Project Tempora surveillance operation, the existence of which was revealed by US National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden.
