Police are investigating a complaint that Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk was subjected to racial abuse during his side's victory over St Mirren.

The Dutch defender reported an incident to police following Celtic's 2-1 win at St Mirren Park on Saturday.

The 23-year-old acted after hearing chants from the crowd.

A police statement said they 'were liaising with both clubs and are analysing broadcast and CCTV footage'  

A police statement read: 'Police Scotland has received a complaint from a Celtic player alleging he was racially abused by a spectator during the St Mirren v Celtic match on Saturday.

'Police are liaising with both clubs and are analysing broadcast and CCTV footage. Inquiries are ongoing.'  

Meanwhile, the Scottish Football Association has postponed a hearing into allegations of racist abuse levelled at Hoops winger Aleksandar Tonev until October 30.

The incident took place during Celtic's 2-1 win over St Mirren in their Scottish Premiership match 

Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan accused the on-loan Aston Villa player of a racial slur during his team's 2-1 defeat at Celtic Park on September 13.

The Bulgarian has been called up to for international duty ahead of this month's Euro 2016 qualifiers with Croatia and Norway.

But Tonev was due to appear before an SFA disciplinary panel on October 9 - the day before Bulgaria's meeting with Croatia - to answer a charge of "excessive misconduct by the use of offensive, insulting and abusive language of a racist nature", so Hampden chiefs have now rescheduled his principal hearing until the end of the month.
