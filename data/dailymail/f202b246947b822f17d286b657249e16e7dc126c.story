Dies: Ottavio Missoni the founder of iconic fashion brand Missoni has died aged 92

The founder of the iconic Missoni fashion label has died at home aged 92.

Ottavio Missoni‘s whose brand was instantly recognisable for its unique zig zag stripes, had recently been hospitalised for heart failure and had resigned as director of the company last year.

His death at his home in Italy comes just months after his son's plane disappeared without a trace off the coast of Venezuela.

The brand's trademark geometric designs had won it high profile fans including Kate Moss and the Duchess of Cambridge.

At its peak in the 1970s Missoni was one of the world’s most influential fashion houses.

More recently it has expanded into branded hotels and home collections.

Ottavio originally founded the company with his wife Rosita, and the entire family continued to be closely involved in the business, considering themselves craftsmen.

He lived in Varese in northern Italy, near the border with Switzerland next to the factory he had built and worked in since 1969.

In his youth he was an accomplished athlete in hurdles and 400m and came 6th in in the 1948 Olympics.

His original collection was a set of tracksuits for the Italian Olympic team.

After meeting his wife they founded a
knitwear label which became Missoni and quickly drew the attention of 
legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland.

Forty years later, their three children - Vittorio, Angela and Luca - took over the company.

Sorrow struck the family earlier this
year when the fashion patriarch's eldest child, company CEO Vittorio 
58, disappeared with his wife and four others while flying in a
small plane during a vacation to a Venezuelan island.

The Missoni family are still hopeful that the pair, who went missing along with friends, Guido Foresti, his wife Elda Scalvenzi, and two Venezuelan pilots, will be found by rescue crews.

The BN-2 Islander plane vanished shortly after takeoff on Jan. 4 from Los
Roques, a tiny archipelago that is a dependency of Venezuela.

It was 
destined for Caracas, the South American nation's capital.

In Feburary police on the tiny island
of Bonaire said that two pieces of luggage from a missing plane that 
was carrying the CEO of Italian fashion house Missoni has washed up on a
local beach.

Italy's 
air safety agency has said the pilot of the vanished plane had an 
expired medical fitness certificate and that the company operating the 
aircraft wasn't yet authorized to fly.

However, the National Flight Safety Agency has said that neither factor is being blamed for the disappearance at this time.

Seven
minutes after takeoff, the pilot reported that he was at 5,000 feet and
10 nautical miles from the Los Roques airport, according to the agency.

The last radar readings showed the 
aircraft accelerating at 5,400 feet before it quickly lost altitude and 
speed, veering to the right until it disappeared from the radar.

Venezuelan air and sea rescue services continued to look for the plane (pictured) which went missing after taking off from the resort of Los Roques

Evidence two days after the plane 
disappeared after taking off from the resort of Los Roques, an 
archipelago that is a popular holiday destination among wealthy 
Europeans, suggested that Vittorio may have been kidnapped.

According to Telecom Italia Mobile, 
the son of fellow passenger Mr Foresti received a text message from his 
father on the evening of January 6th that read, 'Call now, we are 
reachable.'

The phone company confirmed to a 
local Italian television station that the message was sent, but they 
could not verify exactly when it was written, and subsequent calls to 
the number indicated the phone was off.

Angela Missoni, Vittorio's 
58-year-old sister and the creative director of the family-run fashion 
label, told reporters outside her home on January 6th: 'It’s better to 
be kidnapped than at the bottom of the sea. We hope all four are alive 
and well. We also hope that the searches go in all directions.'
