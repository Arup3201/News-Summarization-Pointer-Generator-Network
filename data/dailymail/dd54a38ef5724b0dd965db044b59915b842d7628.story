A New Jersey woman has been arrested for killing a 22-year-old student who died after having her buttocks injected with silicone.

Tamira Mobley, 28, was charged with assault and manslaughter on Monday by police investigating the homicide of Tamara Blaine.

Miss Blaine, who had a young son, was found foaming at the mouth in a pay-per-hour Manhattan hotel last July.

Miss Blaine's death was ruled a homicide in October.

Police believe she had gone to the Liberty Inn Hotel on July 8 last year to get butt injections.

Security camera footage showed Mobley arriving at the pay-per-hour hotel with Miss Blaine on the day she died.

Records show the 28-year-old also paid for the room on her credit card, and was at the hotel when police arrived, according to the New York Post.

Mobley has admitted being with the victim on July 8, but she denied injecting her with silicone.

Miss Blaine, from Brooklyn, had been 
going to college part-time while caring for her young son,Â  Amari 
Bermudez, who was born shortly after she graduated high school.

When
 police and emergency crew arrived at the Liberty Hotel, which describes
 itself as a 'rendezvous for romance', she appeared to be suffering from
 a seizure.

The autopsy revealed two puncture wounds and traces of silicone were found in the young mom's blood. The injuries could not have been self-inflicted, the medical examiner said.

There has been a concerning rise in the number of women seeking black-market injections, where silicone or other industrial-type fillers are injected to create a bigger butt.

Many of the procedures are carried out by people with no medical training, and the injections can cause death or serious injury.
