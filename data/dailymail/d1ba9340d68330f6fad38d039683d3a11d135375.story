Eva Rausing’s body may have lain for up to two months under a pile of bin bags, clothes and bed linen several feet deep which had been stuck together with gaffer tape, a court heard yesterday.

Officers found her decomposing body after gaining access to a ‘secure annex’ buzzing with flies at the 50-room Chelsea mansion she shared with her billionaire husband, a court heard yesterday.

Mrs Rausing, one of Britain’s richest women, was last seen alive on May 3, suggesting she might have died more than two months before her body was found on July 9.

Yesterday her husband Hans Kristian Rausing, whose father is a former boss of food packaging giant Tetra Pak, appeared before magistrates looking frail and withdrawn.

The 49-year-old is charged with preventing the lawful burial of his American wife.

Standing in the dock at West London Magistrates’ Court, bearded and bespectacled Rausing, wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue suit with gold buttons, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. He sat quietly listening to proceedings, clutching a copy of As Seen On TV, a satirical novel by Irish author Chris Kerr.

Last night, Mr Rausing’s parents issued a statement saying their daughter-in-law’s death was a reminder of the ‘distorted reality of drug addiction’.

The court was told that on April 29 this year, mother-of-four Mrs Rausing, a crack cocaine and heroin user, had looked ‘unwell’ after returning home from a rehab clinic in California, and had a swollen face and right leg.

She was last seen on May 3 by a financial consultant who visited the couple’s six-storey mansion in Cadogan Place.

On July 9, her husband was pulled over for ‘swerving and driving erratically’ in South London. When he got out he was unsteady on his feet and his pupils were dilated, the court heard.

Police found a crack pipe in the driver’s footwell, along with cannabis and a white powder that was sent away for analysis.

Eva and Hans were married in London's Swedish Church by the Archbishop of Sweden in 1992

In the boot, they found several unopened letters addressed to Eva Kemeny – the maiden name of his wife of 21 years – the court heard.

Brinkman May, prosecuting, said: ‘He was asked where his wife was. Then his demeanour changed and he appeared to well up. He said, “She went to America two weeks ago”. They asked where. He said, “California”. When they asked where, he became very vague and was unable to say where she was. He was arrested and taken to the police station.’

When police went round to search the £70million mansion, the stench of decomposition led them to a second-floor bedroom.

Mr May said: ‘They continued to search and discovered part of the floor had been cut off to form a secure annex.

‘Various doors of the annex were barricaded or locked and silver gaffer tape was around the bedroom door frame. Officers entered and noticed a stronger smell of decomposition. The bedroom was in a state of disarray, with clothes and household items on the floor, the windows open and there were house flies present.

‘On the floor to the right of the bed they found a large quantity of clothes, bedsheets and bin bags, stuck together with gaffer tape.

‘Under these items, which were several feet deep, they discovered the remains of a deceased person in an advanced state of decomposition. It seems to suggest she had remained at that location for some time.’

Her death is being treated as ‘unexplained’, as a post-mortem examination failed to find a cause of death due to the advanced state of decomposition of her body.

Family event: Eva's family said they hoped her death would raise awareness of drug addiction and financial support for those blighted by it.

Test results to determine whether drugs played a role in the incident are expected back soon.

Rausing and his wife had both suffered
from drug issues for the past 30 years and both had spent time in the 
US trying to treat their problems, said Mr May. The couple, who met two 
decades ago while in a drugs rehabilitation centre in Surrey, were 
active philanthropists.

Mr May described their home as an 
‘extremely large, multi-millionpound residence in Chelsea and 
Kensington, with six floors and over 50 rooms’.

They also spent time in their 11-bedroom mansion in Barbados.

Rausing is heir to a vast fortune from
his Swedish father’s packaging business Tetra Pak. The family is the 
12th richest in Britain and is worth £4.3billion, according to The 
Sunday Times Rich List 2012.

Rausing’s lawyer, Alexander Cameron 
QC, David Cameron’s elder brother, applied for his client to be bailed 
to his home address on the condition he surrender his passport but this 
was rejected by District Judge James Henderson, who said: ‘For a man as 
wealthy as your client, I don’t think a little matter of his passport 
would prevent him leaving the country.’

There was also a problem locating the passport, which is believed to be somewhere in the unkempt house, the court heard.

Rausing was granted conditional bail and ordered to remain at a psychiatric hospital in Marylebone, London.

The judge told him: ‘I grant you bail on two conditions.

‘The first is that you must reside at 
the Capio Nightingale Hospital and that you live there and sleep there 
overnight, and you do not leave that hospital unless you are accompanied
by a member of hospital staff.’

In a statement issued after the 
hearing, Mr Rausing’s parents said: ‘Hans and Marit Rausing and their 
families are mourning the death of their son’s beloved wife, Eva.

‘Her death, and the details of subsequent events, are a reminder of the distorted reality of drug addiction.

‘They desperately hope that their dear
son, Hans, may find the strength to begin the long and hard journey of 
detoxification and rehabilitation.’

Paying tribute to his daughter, Mrs Rausing’s father Tom Kemeny said she interrupted her own drug treatment to help her husband.

The retired Pepsi Cola executive said:
‘At the time of her death, her overriding concern was for the safety of
her beloved husband, for whom she interrupted her own treatment to 
return to London in an attempt to take him back with her to California, 
but tragically to no avail.’

Mr Kemeny described his daughter as ‘a beautiful, generous and fun daughter, wife, mother, sister and aunt’.

He said: ‘They bravely battled their 
demons and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to 
our beloved “son” Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all 
our hearts.’

Rausing, who has yet to enter a plea, is due to appear at Isleworth Crown Court on July 26.
