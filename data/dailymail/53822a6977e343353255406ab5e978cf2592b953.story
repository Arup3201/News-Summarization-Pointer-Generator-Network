Clive Palmer has made a strange accusation against ASIO, saying they have bugged his phone and computers

The colourful character that is Clive Palmer has made some interesting accusations against the Australian Security Intelligence Operation (ASIO), claiming all electronics in his office are bugged.

Mr Palmer has refused to use the computer system in Parliament House, and declared 'all the phones and all the computers are tapped', the Herald Sun report.

Despite these incredulous claims, ASIO have responded telling the publication they're not particularly interested in the Palmer United Party leader or any of his MPs.

Palmer has reportedly paid for and installed brand new computers in his parliamentary office, to ensure his activity can't be monitored in any way.

Furthermore, he's purchased new mobile phones instead of the tax-payer funded ones MPs are issued with, leaving it up to other members of his party to decide whether to follow suit.

Australia's spy agency denied they have any need to investigate the party leader, despite his claims that historically the country's richest were under surveillance.

They said they have no authority to monitor individuals simply based on financial status.

Mr Palmer also warned naivety was dangerous in the digital age, and you can never be too careful especially when politicians are making important decisions on behalf of a nation.

These are not the first concerns the businessman has voiced about his personal security, with his first question to the Prime Minister during question time an enquiry about the bugging of politicians phones.

He queried whether anyone was having their phones or emails intercepted, and whether the offices MPs work out of were bugged or monitored.

In another unusual outburst, last September the billionaire accused Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng of being 'a Chinese spy'.

In an interview with the Today Show he shocked Karl Stefanovic who was conducting the interview by stating that she had been 'spying on Rupert for years, giving money back to Chinese Intelligence.'
