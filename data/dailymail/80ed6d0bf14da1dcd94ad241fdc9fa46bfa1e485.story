Spared jail: Hugh Robert-Wotherspoon was found guilty of assault

A successful international lawyer who fondled a young woman who sat next to him has been put on the sex offenders register for the next five years and fined £3,500.

Hugh Robert Wotherspoon, 54, was convicted of assaulting the woman by touching her in a sexual manner against her will after after Carlisle Crown Court heard how he had repeatedly touched his victims leg throughout the journey from Edinburgh.

The married father-of-two from Carshalton, Surrey, admitted 'trying it on' because it felt natural to stroke her thigh after sitting next to her in cramped conditions for so long - but insisted he wasn't guilty because he believed the woman was enjoying it as much as he was.

At a sentencing hearing on Friday Wotherspoon was also placed on probation supervision and ordered to attend a sexual behavior progamme.

£1,000 of the fine will go to his victim as compensation.

Wotherspoon - a qualified solicitor 
who specialises in patent applications from his firm’s offices in 
London, Munich and New York -  was arrested at Tebay Services on the M6 last August after the German-born woman told the driver she had been assaulted.

During the trial the woman, who comes from London but can’t be named, said she was left 'shocked and shaken' by what happened.

Scene: The assault took place on a National Express bus travelling south from Edinburgh

She said Wotherspoon, who had chosen to 
sit beside her even though there were vacant seats when he got onto the 
bus, first put his hand on her knee.

She said that by the time the coach made its scheduled stop at Tebay, he had spent half an hour with his hand between her legs.

She said: 'I was thinking of hitting him or screaming, but you never know how people will react.'

In court his barrister Madeleine Wolfe said Wotherspoon admitted being 'an unconventional character'.

Guilty: The 54-year-old from Carshalton, Surrey was convicted at Carlisle Crown Court

But she said: 'That does not make him any more dangerous than somebody more straightforward.'

She said Wotherspoon had resigned from his highly-paid job following his conviction. He was also likely to be thrown out by the solicitors’ professional body.

Ms Wolfe said he was 'not the sort of man who needs to be on the sex offenders’ register', but the judge disagreed.

Judge Hughes said he found the case 'deeply troubling' and said he struggled to understand how such an intelligent man with his background could behave as he had done.

He told Wotherspoon: 'You have brought disgrace upon yourself and have caused acute distress and embarrassment on your wife, your family.'
