The report says that blood transfusions could be to blame for CJD remaining dormant in the British population

Up to 1,000 British people could die of the human form of mad cow disease because of infected blood given to them in British hospitals, ministers have been warned. 

The human variant of mad cow disease is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).

It is caused by an abnormal protein called a prion. Prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells, causing a rapid deterioration of the brain and body.

Most people who develop the disease die within one year.

The new report published by the Government’s Health Protection Analytical  Team said that people could have contracted the disease through blood transfusions and they estimate that 30,000 Britons are likely to be carrying the condition in a dormant form. This is double the previous estimate.

Scientists believe that the current total death toll of 176 could rise by more than five-fold as the infection has not been wiped out of the blood supply as it has been in the food chain.

Frank Dobson, a former health secretary, has urged ministers to develop a nationwide screening programme for blood donors to stop future infections of vCJD, which has the potential to cause 'horrendous deaths', according to a report in The Telegraph.

People are no longer in danger of getting vCJD from eating British beef, after ministers ordered the slaughter of millions of cows when the mad cow disease scandal broke in 1989.

However, the Government acknowledges that one in 2,000 Britons – or approximately 30,000 people- are already carriers of the infectious proteins that cause some people to develop vCJD.

A study last summer concluded the prevalence of this 'silent' vCJD is likely to be twice as high as previously thought.

These 30,000 carriers can unknowingly pass on the infectious proteins to new sufferers through donated blood.

Millions of cows were slaughtered after the CJD outbreak in 1989

Because so little is known about vCJD, no one knows which carriers will go on to develop the disease or whether any new cases will actually occur at all.

There have been no new cases for two years and there are thought to be no surviving sufferers of vCJD.

To combat the problem surrounding blood transfusions, the report suggests ministers could consider recruiting young blood donors born after 1996 once they become eligible, as they will not have eaten infected beef.

Mr Dobson, the former Labour Health Secretary, said 'everything humanly possible should be done to develop a blood test.'

'There is no room at all for complacency,' he said. '[With a blood test], you would be able to screen every potential donor.

'If that screening showed the incidence was higher than thought then maybe you would do it for the whole population.'

A spokesman for the Department of Health said the Government continues to encourage 'people of all ages to give blood', adding 'we have one of the safest blood supplies in the world'.

'Independent experts from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs have used this study during their considerations of measures to reduce the potential risk of transmission through blood transfusions,' she said.

'There is no evidence of any UK clinical cases of vCJD being linked to a blood transfusion given after 1999.'
