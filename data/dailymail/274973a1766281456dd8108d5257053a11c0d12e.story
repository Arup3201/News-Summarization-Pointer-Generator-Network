The website blamed for the death of  Hannah Smith have offered to name the trolls who tormented her

The website linked to a string of teenage suicides including the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith have offered to name the trolls who tormented her.

Hannah was found hanged in her bedroom, in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, last Friday after suffering months of abuse from trolls on Ask.fm who repeatedly urged her to kill herself, cut herself and ‘drink bleach’.

Founders Mark and Ilja Terebin, the wealthy sons of a Red Army officer, have promised to hand over details of her abusers after Prime Minister David Cameron urged parents, teenagers and advertisers to boycott the site.

In an open letter they wrote: 'Although it is possible to post anonymously to the site, we would like to reassure parents that in almost all cases it is possible for Ask.fm to identify users – through IP technology, everything on the internet is traceable – and in extreme circumstances such as those we’ve experienced this week we work through existing legal frameworks to ensure this information is accessible to the appropriate legal authorities.'

Firms such as Vodaphone, Laura Ashley and Specsavers as well as charity Save the Children pulled their adverts yesterday. 

The open letter came hours after the Prime Minister urged the Terebins, and those running similar sites, to ‘step up to the plate and show some responsibility’.

Mr Cameron also urged parents and teenagers to avoid using the ‘vile’ websites.

He told Sky News: ‘Just because someone does something online, it doesn’t mean they’re above the law. If you incite someone to do harm, if you incite violence, that is breaking the law, whether that is online or offline.

The mother and father of the Soviet-born brothers deny that their sons are in any way culpable over the death of Hannah

‘Also, there’s something all of us can do as parents and as users of the internet and that is not to use some of these vile sites. Boycott them, don’t go there, don’t join them – we need to do that as well.’

But some experts believe a ban is too simplistic. Holly Seddon, of parenting and technology website Quib.ly, told The Times: 'Even if (ask.fm) was taken down, there are many other avenues for online and offline bullying.

'There is a danger that if we just fixate on one product, we are not having the conversations we should have, whether that is in the government or with our kids.'
