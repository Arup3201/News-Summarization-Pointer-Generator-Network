His tweet prompted a flood of criticism on Twitter, with people angry he bragged about his own newspaper rather than mentioning the victims.

"You sick man RT @rupertmurdoch AUST gets wake-call with Sydney terror. Only Daily Telegraph caught the bloody outcome at 2.00 am. Congrats," pop singer Anthony Callea tweeted.

Winners and Losers star Melanie Vallejo said Murdoch's tweet was disgusting, while comedian Adam Hills said: "I'm sorry. Is this real?"

Former prime minister Kevin Rudd's daughter, Jessica Rudd, also took to Twitter.

"Good grief @rupertmurdoch AUST gets wake-call with Sydney terror. Only Daily Telegraph caught the bloody outcome at 2.00 am. Congrats," she wrote.

The daughter of former prime minister Kevin Rudd was shocked by Murdoch's tweet

Media commentator and author Mike Carlton was one of the first people to criticise Murdoch's behaviour.

"You'd think @rupertmurdoch would be having another of his humble days. But he's actually boasting about the Telegraph coverage. Disgraceful," he said. 

Other tweeters hurled all sorts of names at Murdoch, calling him a "callous pr**k" and "morbid ghoul".

"@rupertmurdoch are you actually the spawn of Satan? Serious question," @jonainscough said.

The criticism comes just two weeks after he caused a Twitter storm by commenting on Ridley Scott's new biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings.

The 83-year-old weighed in on the debate about the cast of the film being too white by tweeting 'Moses film attacked on Twitter for all white cast.  Since when are Egyptians not white?  All I know are.'

The 83-year-old weighed in on the debate about the cast of the film 'Exodus' which stars Christian Bale as being too white

The film stars Christian Bale, Australian actor Joel Edgerton and Sigourney Weaver.

His comment was re-tweeted more than 2,600 times and was ridiculed by some followers.

One person tweeted 'It seems @rupertmurdoch's Twitter account was hacked by @rupertmurdoch' while another commented '@rupertmurdoch I can tell you're a real man of the people.'

The media magnate then tried to backpedal by tweeting 'Of course Egyptians are Middle Eastern, but far from black.  They treated blacks as slaves', followed by 'Okay, there are man shades of color. Nothing racist about that, so calm down!'.

Murdoch joined twitter three years ago and frequently updates his account for his 537,000 followers.
