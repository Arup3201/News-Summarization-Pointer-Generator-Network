Art specialist Harriet Wheeler wanted to exchange a £2,000 jacket, which was an unwanted gift, but instead she was detained by police for seven hours

When Harriet Wheeler was given a £2,000 Mulberry jacket by a generous male friend, she faced an awkward dilemma.

Beautiful though it was, she felt it did not suit her.

Not wanting to upset her friend by telling him, she took the black quilted leather jacket back to Mulberry's flagship store in London and asked whether she could exchange it for something else.

There the ancient art specialist found herself handcuffed, arrested and marched off to a police cell on suspicion of handling stolen or fake goods.

To make matters worse, her friend was dragged into the row when he was telephoned as part of the criminal inquiry.

Now police have decided there is no case to answer, and have told Miss Wheeler, 25, she can collect her jacket from them.

But there are still questions about its origins as Mulberry insists that it may not be the genuine article.

Miss Wheeler is mortified that her friend found out in such a dramatic way that she didn't like his gift, and is furious that Mulberry has not apologised.

She insists the explanation is simple.
Unbeknown to her, her friend had bought the jacket direct from the East
London manufacturer.

That meant she was not entitled to a refund or exchange from Mulberry but she had no idea of that when she arrived at the shop.

Mortified: Miss Wheeler is humiliated that her friend found out in such a dramatic way that she didn't like his gift, and is furious that Mulberry has not apologised

She said Mulberry staff believed only 
six of the jackets had been made. One, a size 8 like hers, had been 
stolen from the store, leaving them fearing she was trying to exchange 
stolen goods.

Last night Miss Wheeler, who works for
an antiquities firm specialising in Egyptian, Greek and Roman coins, 
told how the drama unfolded last week.

'My friend is a generous person, and 
when he gave me the jacket I thought it was beautiful – but it didn't 
suit me,' she said from her home in Wandsworth, South London.

Miss Wheeler had been given the expensive black leather jacket by a friend, but wanted to return it

'I didn't want my friend to know I was
trying to exchange it, but after a couple of months I phoned Mulberry 
to talk about the jacket, and decided to go into the New Bond Street 
store.

'It took ages for it to be sorted out.
The store manager kept telling me it wouldn't be much longer. 
Eventually the police walked in.

'I didn't know what was going on and 
when the police officer said I was under arrest for handling stolen 
goods I was in shock. Then she whacked the handcuffs on me. I was so 
upset, I was in a mess.'

Miss Wheeler said that after waiting 
an hour for a patrol car to turn up, she was 'paraded' down New Bond 
Street in her handcuffs on the way to a police station.

'It was so humiliating,' she said. 'I 
was left in a cell for four or five hours and when I asked how long it 
would be they replied, "How long is a piece of string? You could be 
looking at staying overnight".

'Then hours later a detective breezed 
in and said they had got hold of my friend, who was on holiday in 
Barbados, and he corroborated my story that the jacket wasn't stolen.

'It's been hugely embarrassing,' she said. 'I feel angry and it's left a bitter taste in my mouth.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Following enquiries the woman was released and no further action was taken.'

A Mulberry spokesman said staff called
police after being 'forewarned that a customer was attempting to return
a product which had not been sold by Mulberry'. She suggested the 
jacket was not authentic before declining to comment further.
