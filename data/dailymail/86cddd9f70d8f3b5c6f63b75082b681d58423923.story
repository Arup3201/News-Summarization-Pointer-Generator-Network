Britain has blocked political asylum applications by two top Russian bankers amid suspicions the government wants to mend fences with strongman Vladimir Putin who returns to the Kremlin as president on Monday.

The former head of the Bank of Moscow Andrei Borodin, 45, and his deputy Dmitry Akulinin, 46, both exiled in London, are being denied asylum status by the Home Office, say sources close to the men.

The move is being seen in Russia as a significant shift by Britain coming as Putin begins a new stint in the Kremlin which could last 12 years.

Borodin - who fled Moscow for London - faces at least four charges of theft and embezzlement in Moscow and the Russian authorities have formally asked for his extradition.

The pair are accused of improperly loaning £285million to shell companies which then transferred the cash to holdings of Yelena Baturina, 48, Russia richest woman who is now also living in exile in London.

They claim they were forced out of the bank for political reasons and blame outgoing president Dmitry Medvedev who next week will become prime minister in a job swap with Putin.

The move is likely to be welcomed by the Kremlin which claims the case is purely about corruption.

One Moscow newspaper said the Home Office rejection is a 'break with a tradition of providing refuge for Russian exiles'.

Britain's relations with Russia have been in the deep freeze since 2006 with the death of Putin foe Alexander Litvinenko in London from radioactive poisoning.

Dozens of exiles have been given asylum or permission to stay in Britain since Putin came to power in 2000.

Borodin - who has a fortune of £500million - yesterday refused to comment citing advice by his lawyer.
