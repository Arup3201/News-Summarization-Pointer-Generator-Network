Chelsea Under 19s started their UEFA Youth League campaign with an impressive 4-1 victory over Schalke at Cobham.

The German side eliminated the Blues at the quarter-final stage last season but could not compete against a much changed side in coach Adi Viveash's debut in European competition.

Isaiah Brown opened the scoring after only 10minutes when he took a great pass over the top on his chest before slotting it past Schalke keeper Janik Schilder.

The Germans equalised through Maurice Multhaup only five minutes later with a fortunate rebound from Ola Aina's attempted clearance.

But, Chelsea took command with Belgian Charly Musonda flighting a diagonal ball for Dominic Solanke to finish from close range to give the Blues a half-time lead.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who had been involved in most of Chelsea's best moves, strode forward before releasing Brown who finished with a drilled shot into the far corner in the second-half. 

Schalke wasted several chances to bring themselves back into the game before the post denied Brown from netting his hat-trick - but the rebound fell kindly to Aina to secure a deserved victory.

The Germans had substitute Hendrik Lohmar sent off for a second bookable offence shortly after but the result was never in question by that stage.

The Under 19s travel to Sporting Lisbon in their next group stage encounter on Tuesday September 30.
