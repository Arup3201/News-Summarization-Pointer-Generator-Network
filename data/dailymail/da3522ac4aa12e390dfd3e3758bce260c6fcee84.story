Leanne Meredith was found guilty of two charges after her American bulldogs attacked a prize bull

A prize one ton bull had to be put down after it was savaged by two American bulldogs.

The animals 'shredded' one of the Limousin's ears and left it covered in blood after the attack in its farm pen.

Dog owner Leanne Meredith, 33, wept in court after she heard an application will be made to destroy her two American bulldogs, Murphy and Miley.

She was found guilty at the court in Holyhead, Anglesey, of allowing the dogs to worry livestock and a charge under the Dangerous Dogs Act of allowing them to enter a place where they were not permitted to be.

In a separate trial, Meredith was today found guilty of allowing a third dog to worry sheep.

In the bull attack, one farm worker told the court that he feared for his life when the dogs attacked at Tynygongl, near Benllech, on Anglesey, in July last year.

District Judge Andrew Shaw heard that one of the dogs broke its jaw in the attack but that the bull, called Hercules, later became infertile and was put down.

Both dogs are being held in secure kennels and the judge said it will decide on whether they should be destroyed.

Judge Shaw rejected Meredith's claim that the attack had taken place after the bull had strayed on to her property and the dogs were defending themselves, or that prosecution witnesses were lying.

The judge heard that the bull had later become infertile and was put down.

In the second trial, single mother 
Meredith, who now lives in Wimbledon, south London, was found guilty of a
further Dangerous Dogs Act charge relating to another dog, Humphrey, 
and also admitted allowing him to worry sheep.

An application has been made to destroy Miley, pictured, and Murphy, following the attack

This followed an incident last September in which Murphy was one of three dogs which escaped and attacked a flock of sheep on land adjoining a caravan site at Tynygongl.

Nine sheep died. The farmer shot dead two dogs not belonging to the defendant, and Humphrey, a French Bordeaux, was shot in the head.

He was found a few days later but was almost blinded and is now being looked after by a member of the family. A decision on whether to destroy Humphrey has not yet been made.

District Judge Shaw adjourned sentence on all the cases until next month and ordered a report from the probation service.

The one-ton prize Limousin bull called Hercules, similar to the one pictured, had to be put down

Nia Lloyd, prosecuting, said there will be applications for destruction orders, compensation, disqualification from keeping dogs, and court costs.

Kennel fees for Murphy and Miley have so far amounted to Â£11,318.

Barrister Paul Humpherson, defending, said Meredith had kept dogs without trouble all her life, mainly in London, and that Humphrey was normally docile and safe with children.

'I wouldn't make a destruction order unless I felt I had to,' the judge said.
