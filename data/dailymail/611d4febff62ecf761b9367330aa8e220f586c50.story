'Disgust': Single mother Chelsea Press was told by a Basildon District Council adviser she was £54 a week worse off by working part-time

Single working mother Chelsea Press 
was struggling to juggle her part-time job with raising her  young 
daughter and paying her bills.

Proud to be working, she just wanted to know if she was entitled to some more benefits to help make ends meet.

So the 23-year-old booked a consultation at her local council offices to assess her  financial situation.

After
totting up the income from her job and tax allowances compared with her
outgoings, she was horrified when the official  declared: ‘You’d be 
better off on benefits’.

As an unemployed person, she would not have to pay rent or council tax and would be £238 a month better off.

Miss
Press was outraged by the advice and insists she has no intention of 
giving up her job working 27 hours a week looking after the elderly.

She
will stick to her traditional values of hard work and wants to  set a 
good example for two-year old daughter Lacey.

Miss Press also fears that other people with less of a work ethic could just take the softer option.

She said: ‘I was disgusted. The council adviser should never have said that to me.

‘Telling some people they are better off on benefits would probably make them give up work.

 ‘I
love my job, but it is hard leaving Lacey when I am getting such little
financial benefit from it. I don’t feel any better off in work, but I 
really enjoy it.

‘Lacey knows that I go to work and help the old people. I hope she is proud of me.

‘I
want to set her a good example and show her that you don’t just sit at 
home expecting everything to be given to you on a plate.’

Shocking: The adviser also told Miss Press she would have an extra £2,850 a year if she left her job and would be able to spend more time with her daughter Lacey, two, pictured

Struggling: Despite regularly being unable to pay her bills, Miss Press refuses to leave her part-time job as a carer for the elderly as she says it would set a bad example for her daughter

Monthly income on benefits:

£600 income support£81.24 child benefit£260 child tax creditsTotal: £941.24

Monthly income in work:

£650 wage£81.24 child benefit£454 working tax credits and child tax creditsTotal: £1,185.24Total minus additional outgoings: £703.24

Additional outgoings in work:

£280 rent£90 council tax£112 nursery fees contribution

Miss
Press, from Basildon, Essex, gets by each month on her £650 wages, 
£81.24 child benefit and £454 working tax credits and child tax credits.

Her total income adds up to £1,185.24 but after bills she is left with 
£703.24 to live on.

Half her income goes on rent, council tax and nursery fees before the remainder goes on utility bills and food.

The other outgoings are £280 on rent, £90 council tax and £112 contribution for nursery fees.

She
says that without free babysitting help from her sister, she would be 
unable to hold down her job at the Munday House care home in Basildon.

However, on the dole, she would receive £600 income support, £81.24 in 
child benefit and £260 in child tax credits but would not pay rent or 
council tax.

The jobless option would leave her with £941.24 to live on – a difference of £238.

Miss
Press says she has such a struggle on her income, she allows  her 
daughter to eat first before seeing what is left for her.

Last night, Basildon District Council promised to investigate the incident.

Phil
Turner, deputy leader of the Conservative-run authority, said: ‘Our 
officers give very good advice, so I am surprised to hear what she says.

‘I will go back to officers to make it absolutely clear to all teams we have to get the message across.’

Reply: The deputy leader of Basildon District Council, pictured from the outside above, said he was 'surprised' at the advice Miss Press was given and will talk to his advisers

Work still doesn’t pay for hundreds of thousands of families who live below the poverty line,  researchers claimed yesterday.

The study, which was carried out in Wales, found that 51 per cent of the poor come from working families.

They include one-earner households, many of them traditional families where the mother stays at home to raise the children, and households where two adults work, but only part-time.

The findings from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation came a week after the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the Government’s welfare reforms are beginning to improve the incomes of working people compared to the welfare-dependent.

The Foundation report said families were classed as below the poverty line if they earned 60 per cent less than the national average weekly household income.

The report said: ‘The starkest finding shows that those who are working and live in poverty now exceeds the number of those who are not in work.’

Last night a spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ‘ ‘We remain committed to making work pay and our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities.’
