Vinnie Jones has revealed how Crazy Gang pal John Fashanu savagely beat up a Wimbledon team-mate by throwing him around the dressing-room and smashing him against the floor.

It is one of several stunning confessions from a television documentary about the Crazy Gang that charts the club’s incredible climb in the 1980s from the lower divisions to winning the FA Cup final at Wembley.

In the programme, which will be screened on BT Sport on Boxing Day, it is revealed:

Several former players including Fashanu, Scales, Phelan, goalkeeper Dave Beasant and Andy Thorn attended the premiere of The Crazy Gang in London on Thursday night alongside their ex-managers Dave Bassett and Bobby Gould and chairman Sam Hammam, while Jones sent his apologies from Los Angeles where he now works as a film actor.

The documentary described in their own words how a collection of misfits and failures changed the landscape of English football in the 1980s, partly through a culture of intimidation and violence, towards each other and opponents.

Alongside glory moments like winning promotion to the First Division and winning the FA Cup were reminders of darker times, including Fashanu fracturing the eye socket of Tottenham defender Gary Mabbutt, Jones ending the career of England defender Gary Stevens and also squeezing Paul Gascoigne’s testicles.

But most shocking to fans will be the violence that existed within the club – something Fashanu, a black belt in karate, did little to hide in the film.

His close pal Jones recalled one dressing-room fight between Fashanu and an unnamed player that left him particularly stunned. ‘Fash threw him around like a rag doll, I’ve never seen anything like it, never seen nothing like it,’ said the tough-guy actor.

‘We had wooden benches that went around, Fash literally lifted him up, swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated.

‘The fella had to have 20 stitches or 30 stitches in his calf, split it to bits.

‘Fash could be hilarious, a very funny man. But when he was angry, he was a very tough man. He didn’t hold off.’

There was also the feud between Fashanu and Sanchez that ended with Sanchez calling a reporter and telling him the striker had tried to karate-kick his legs.

Defender Scales was an eye-witness, saying: ‘We were used to see very unusual things and heavy conflicts but that physical face-to-face coming to blows was the most shocking thing I saw.’

And striker Terry Gibson revealed: ‘For six years they never spoke to each other. They were in the same changing room but wouldn’t even celebrate together.’

Fashanu was an intimidating figure to both the opposition and his own team-mates, it has been revealed

Sanchez admits the rift started almost immediately. ‘From the first moment, he knew what I was and I knew what he was,’ he said.

Goalkeeper Beasant thought Sanchez, who unusually for footballers of that generation held a university degree, regarded the more streetwise Fashanu as pretentious for using words in conversations when he didn’t know what they meant.

Fashanu comes across as largely unapologetic in the film but does admit at one stage: ‘Sometimes I even wince at some of things we made them do. Locking them in the boot of their car, dragging them around the pitch in the snow. You can’t eat for two days, someone will sit there and make sure you don’t eat.

‘I suggested to Scalesy (John Scales) that it might be an idea if we see the manager. He didn’t quite understand my English I don’t think, because the second time there was no word, I just grabbed him by his nostrils.

‘He had one of two choices, you either sink or swim. There were days when you thought Scalesy was almost breaking because it was not easy for him.

‘But if he and Phelo (Terry Phelan) saw us today, they would say "Thank you, Fash", you may have beaten the hell out of us but you changed our character.’

While some of the Crazy Gang like Fashanu, Jones and Dennis Wise loved the atmosphere instigated by manager Dave Bassett and assistant Wally Downes, some of the later signings found it hard to cope.

Scales, signed from Bristol Rovers, admits on camera: ‘The first thing I’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it, having a drink. Was it conducive to me playing well? Obviously not as an athlete. But at that stage it was a coping mechanism.

‘I had some pretty frank, long conversations with my dad, saying, "Is this really what I want to do, is this a place I want to be, I can’t cope, I am finding it incredibly different". Yes, (it was a) challenging place to be in my life and around the club.

‘I remember getting in the car and getting psyched up for training so I would be able to cope with it, to have the confidence to be assertive. I knew if I was that person who was relatively shy and unassuming, the Crazy Gang would swallow me up.’

Defender John Scales is one player who has admitted he struggled to cope with the bullying culture

Phelan, a left back brought in from Swansea City, recalls seeing some players cry at the abuse they received.

He said: ‘It was like a pack of wolves going out looking for blood. It wasn’t normal. I’ve seen players actually cry, physically break down and cry. It was a place for me that was really dark for six months, socially and emotionally.

‘As a footballer you have dreams, for six months I had no dreams. I used to sit in my bedroom upstairs, and I’d say, "My career is gone, where can I go from here?".

Downes is unrepentant at creating a culture where only the strongest survived. ‘Very, very, very tough love,’ he described it as.

Scales and Phelan did survive and shared in the FA Cup glory. But some of the most savage treatment was saved for opponents, with centre half Thorn admitting: ‘We went too far loads of times.’

Dennis Wise was a terrier in Wimbeldon's midfield and worked in tandem with Jones to intimidate players

Cork recalls putting Steve Bruce’s nose out of place on one side in the opening minutes of the game and then catching him on the other side.

Jones, who has gone on to have a successful career as an actor playing gangsters and tough guys, summed up the deliberate intimidation.

‘There was a few punch-ups, there were a few confrontations, we just went out, “How dare you think you can walk over us like we are a piece of crap on your shoes”. Shut up, bang,’ he said.

‘We’d look for an opponent who was weak and play on it. I’d say, "Wisey we’ve got one here". Or he might say "Jonesy, we’ve got one here".

‘We’d shout “Put it in the mixer”, when the ball was in the air you’d see their legs going, they’d be thinking “Oh, s***”. We were a proper organised force.’

Bassett admits his management philosophy was, "Why take 12 passes when you can get it up in one?". It was refined slightly when he was replaced by Gould in 1987 but only slightly.

‘He (Gould) just did what he was told,’ smiled Gibson.

The Wimbledon story, from non-League to First Division in nine years, will probably never be repeated.

For many of their players, it was a final chance to beat the odds and a new family. Barnado’s child Fashanu, hod carrier Jones and Southampton reject Wise all went on to great careers after leaving Wimbledon, their characters moulded by learning at a tough school.

There was black humour too with Bassett suggesting setting Cork’s car on fire after he had blocked him getting a pay rise.

‘He said “What am I going to do”, I said "Go and burn your car and claim on the insurance",’ said Bassett. And the fire did take place.

It was the violence though that will divide opinion as to whether Wimbledon’s story was a fairytale or a nightmare.

The last word had to go to Fashanu, of course. Did he have any regrets? ‘Not striking Lawrie Sanchez sooner,’ he replied.
