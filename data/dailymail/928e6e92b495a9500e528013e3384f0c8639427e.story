An underwater diver captures the only place on Earth where you can dive or snorkel between two continental plates, the Silfra canyon in southern Iceland. 

The crystal clear waters flow within the crack between the North American and Eurasian continents, which drift 2cm further apart each year. 

The stunning images were captured at 49ft during an expedition of Thingvellir Lake, by French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie.

Submerged 49ft deep, a diver explores the pristine waters of the Silfra canyon in southern Iceland. The canyon is a crack between the North American and Eurasian continents and every year these two continental plates drift 2cm further apart

The cold water temperature of between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius, and the filtering process through porous underground lava before it reaches Thingvellir Lake, result in the visibility of 100m

French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie captured the images during a diving expedition through the freshwater Silfra canyon, located in Thingvellir Lake, Iceland

The 40-year-old, of Montpellier, France, says: 'I had the privilege to dive at the famous Silfra dive site, probably the most impressive freshwater rift in Iceland. 

'It is without a doubt a world class dive site, with one of the clearest freshwaters on Earth.

'I felt hypnotised by the transparency, and it almost made me dizzy!'

The cold water temperature, and the filtering process through porous underground lava before it reaches Thingvellir Lake, result in the visibility of 100m. 

The water temperature ranges between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius all year round, as a result of its source being the second largest ice cap in Iceland, the nearby Langjokul. 

Foulquie, 40, of Montpellier, France, says: 'I had the privilege to dive at the famous Silfra dive site, probably the most impressive freshwater rift in Iceland. I felt hypnotised by the transparency, and it almost made me dizzy!'

Foulquie managed to use this visibility to capture the stunning shots between the two tectonic plates. 

He says: 'I did attempt to have a drink whilst diving in the lake, but the water temperature is about 2 or 3 degrees Celsius, and you're already frozen so you don't really need more refreshing.

'However, because of the lava filtration - which is one of the best in the world - the lake tastes of the purest of waters.

'When people look at photographs, the first sentence is usually 'it looks like they were in weightlessness' - a phenomenon which occurs when there is no force of support on your body.'

The diver said he attempted to drink from the waters because of the extreme purity due to the lava filtration
