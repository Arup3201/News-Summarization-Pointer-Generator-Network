They are the urban vehicle of choice for the well-heeled across the UK – but the spiritual home of the Chelsea tractor is... erm, Chelsea.

The gas-guzzlers are most likely to be sought after by the wealthy residents of the area of South West London that gave the off-road vehicle its nickname, a report out yesterday reveals.

The home of the Sloane beats ‘Archers’ 
country’ in England, Shakespeare country in leafy Warwickshire, and even
 Aberdeenshire in Scotland, and parts of rural Wales when it comes to 
the popularity of 4X4s.

A recent AA survey found drivers in south west London search online for 4x4 cars more than other motorists throughout the UK

In September, 1,955 people searched online for an off-roader in the home of the ‘Sloane Ranger’, according to research by AA Cars.

It was comfortably ahead of rural 
Worcestershire - the real life inspiration for BBC Radio Four’s 
long-running rural soap-opera ‘The Archers’ - from which there were 
1,763 searches.

It also beat Worcestershire (1,763 searches), Derbyshire (1,749), Warwickshire (1,701) and Cumbria (867) – rural areas for which the vehicles were designed.

There are more than twice as many searches in the up-market London area 
than in Aberdeenshire  (953), Monmouthshire in Wales (918), Aberdeen 
(909), and Cumbria (867), which takes in the Lake District.

The website www.theAACars.com currently offers more than 133,000 used cars, of which, more than 5,000 are 4x4s.

The report said: ‘Whilst most 4x4s never go off road, 
they can be very useful vehicles to negotiate potholes, tow boats or 
caravans or accommodate numerous passengers who like a better view.

Though designed for tough, rural terrain, 4x4s such as Range Rovers were most sought after by city dwellers according to the report

'However with restricted parking, narrow streets and no congestion charge
 exemptions for 4x4s in South West London, it is perhaps 
surprising that their popularity is still so strong.’

Experts
 say one possible reason is that 4X4s have a similarly large ‘footprint’
 to a London black cab so are less likely to be intimidated, bullied or 
cut up by other cars or big buses, and can better stand their ground in 
the cut and thrust of the capital’s traffic.

David
 Bruce, director of AA Cars said: ‘It is surprising that there are more 
searches for 4x4s in South West London than in most rural counties, from
 Cumbria to Cornwall.

'Some of this may be linked to the status of the 4x4, the state of the roads or the fact that a proportion of Londoners like to retreat to the countryside in their ‘Chelsea tractors’ at weekends.’

He added: ‘It’s even been claimed that certain Sloane Rangers used spray-on mud on their vehicles to pretend that they had been off-road.’

He said: ‘As colder weather arrives we find that searches for 4x4s on AA Cars increase.'
