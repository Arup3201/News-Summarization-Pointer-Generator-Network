Conman: Ian McEnroe, 49, duped owners of boutiques, toy shops and wine merchants in wealthy Manchester suburbs to give him refunds for items he'd stolen

A conman swindled thousands of pounds from a string of shops - by claiming their goods had injured his wife and children.

Drug addict Ian McEnroe, 49, targeted boutiques, toy shops, delis and wine merchants in wealthy south Manchester suburbs.

He approached stores across Stockport, Didsbury and Chorlton claiming their clothes, bottles, drinking glasses and even toys were dangerous to get refunds and vouchers as compensation.

In one scam last October, McEnroe told the owner of Monkey Puzzle toys in Chorlton that his son had cut himself on a shard of glass in a box of Lego.

The tale was completely untrue, but he was refunded for the imaginary accident.

He also duped staff at Ye Old Cock Inn in Didsbury by telling them his daughter had bitten into an ice cube which contained a piece of glass. Again, he got a refund.

Employees at The Cheese Hamlet in Wilmslow Road, Didsbury, refunded McEnroe after he claimed his wife had cut herself on a wine bottle bought from their deli.

In several incidents, he stole items from shops and then took them back and demanded a refund. In total he defrauded the businesses of £2,914.

Manchester Crown Court heard many of the traders were ‘more affected by the feeling of being duped than the financial loss’.

Lies: McEnroe also claimed his son was injured by a blade found in toy packaging he 'purchased' from Giddy Goat Toys on Albert Hill Street in Manchester

McEnroe, from Hulme, who has a string of fraud and theft offences dating back 30 years, was stealing to fund a heroin and cocaine addiction.

He was tracked down in Birmingham where he shoplifted clothes then rang police as ‘a cry for help’.

McEnroe pleaded guilty to 18 charges of fraud between November 2011 and February this year.

He also asked for another 15 offences, from other parts of the country, to be taken into account.McEnroe, a grandfather-of-one, was jailed for 15 months.

Recorder Judge William Waldron QC told him: 'You preyed on people’s goodwill, their sensitivity and compassion.'
