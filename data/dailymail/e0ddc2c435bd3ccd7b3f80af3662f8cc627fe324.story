This piano could be the narrowest in the world but pianists won’t have the chance to play a waltz or a sonata - as it has only five keys.

With three white keys and two black and one pedal, composers would struggle to come up with a catchy tune.

And that's before you factor in the problem of it no longer having its strings and not making a sound.

The 3ft 9in piano is less than a foot wide, so it's probably for the best that it is now a sculpture, not a functioning instrument.

Sculptor Bjorn Perborg took a saw to a grand piano and turned it into a sculpture that sold for £2,400

The piano only has three white and two black keys - even Status Quo might struggle to work within such limits

The sculpture is less than a foot wide - so even if sound were possible, you'd have to stand up to play it

The miniature grand was created by sculptor Bjorn Perborg, who took a saw to a full-size piano that was being thrown away.

He chopped the instrument into three sections and threw away the middle piece, before sticking the two ends together.

The piano strings had to be stripped out during the demolition, so you can tinkle the ivories but it won't make a sound.

The piano was showcased at an exhibition and then sold for £2,400 to a museum.

Mr Perborg, 38, a full-time sculptor from Paris, France, said: 'I made this piece for a gallery show.

'I showed an installation about the Collyer brothers, two hoarders who lived like hermits in Manhattan during the first half of the 20th century.

'One of the brothers used to be a concert pianist and I thought a crippled piano could go well with their story.

The piece was sold by Perborg to a museum for £2,400

The grand piano that was being thrown away has had its life extended by the sculptor - and will be preserved in a museum

'There were people giving away pianos for free, so I took one and cut it into three pieces, threw away the middle section and reassembled the other two parts.

'The lid and the music stand had to be cut separately as well.

'I didn’t have the proper tools to cut the heavy casted metal frame that holds the strings inside the piano, the harp, so I decided not to use it.

'It is not a functioning piano and I consider it to be a sculpture.'
