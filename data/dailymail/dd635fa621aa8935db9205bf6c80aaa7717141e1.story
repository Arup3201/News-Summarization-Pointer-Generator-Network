Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims

A Church of England Archbishop covered up the crimes of a serial child sex abuser, a damning report by a judge said yesterday.

The former Archbishop of York, Lord Hope, allowed the Very Rev Robert Waddington to escape exposure or punishment for his actions.

The judge said Lord Hope’s ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’.

Judge Sally Cahill said: ‘Because of the actions he took, and his inaction on other occasions, opportunities were missed for an investigation which may have led to a prosecution during Robert Waddington’s lifetime.’ Waddington died in 2007. One of his victims committed suicide in 1989.

Lord Hope had been second only to the Archbishop of Canterbury in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church while in the post from 1995 to 2005. The 74-year-old remains an active Honorary Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Bradford.

The report listed seven breaches of Church safeguarding rules by Lord Hope in 1999, five in 2003 and six in 2004. It added that the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Rev Nigel McCulloch, did not take any action out of respect for and obedience to his superior, Lord Hope. The judge’s 126-page report into the way the Church behaved blamed ‘cumulative’ failings by Lord Hope.

Claims by Lord Hope that he followed guidelines on abuse were rejected, with the judge saying his failings included ‘not following the Church’s policies’.

The judge’s report was drawn up following the decision last year by former Manchester chorister Eli Ward to speak out. He told how from the age of 11 he was groomed and then sexually abused by Waddington. The assaults began in 1984, shortly after Waddington became Dean of Manchester, the cleric in charge of the cathedral. He held the job for nine years.

Seven victims who complained about abuse by Waddington between 1955 and 1996 were listed in the report. A head chorister from Carlisle, where Waddington worked in the 1970s, was said to have taken holidays with the clergyman and visited his home. After leaving university the boy, named as Peter and nicknamed Tweet, developed depression and schizophrenia before committing suicide in 1989.

Robert Waddington died in 2007. He had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996

Judge Cahill said: ‘There is no information that we have received which leads us to doubt the veracity of the accounts we have heard and read from the alleged victims.’

The present Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu, who took over from Lord Hope, said: ‘I am deeply ashamed that the Church was not vigilant enough to ensure that these things did not happen, failing both to watch and to act, when children were at serious risk.’ The Archbishop made a ‘whole-hearted apology’ to the victims, adding: ‘The report is the result of painstakingly meticulous research and, as such, deserves the utmost attention.’

In a statement, Lord Hope described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ and said he was ‘disappointed’ with it. He accused the judge of criticising him unfairly and misunderstanding Church policies.

Lord Hope added: ‘This report makes clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. If either of the two persons concerned feel in the light of this report they have been denied the justice they deserve then on behalf of the Church, I offer my personal and profound apology.’

Judge Cahill made a string of recommendations for reforms to CofE child protection policies. Archbishop Sentamu also said the Church would in future ensure that cathedral choirboys are always chaperoned by ‘suitably trained adults’ and that priests may be required to report to police if they hear confessions of child abuse.

The Church of England declined to publish Judge Cahill’s report online, which means it is not easily available to the public.

The Church said this was ‘at the request of some of those interviewed by the inquiry’. Church officials said the request was made by victims of Waddington.
