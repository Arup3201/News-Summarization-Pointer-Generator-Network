A diner had to be rushed to hospital after eating the toxic liver of a puffer fish in a Michelin two-star restaurant in Tokyo.

The restaurant's head chef has been suspended by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for serving the dish at Fugu Fukuji in the capital's upmarket Ginza area.

The 35-year-old woman had to be taken to hospital suffering from a headache and numbness in her lips after eating her meal at the restaurant on November 10.

Dangerous: Japanese delicacy puffer fish must be prepared carefully before being served

A Japanese health official said: 'The chef served a liver, knowing that it is toxic, even if it was a request from the customer. It should warrant punitive actions'.

The woman, who has not been named, recovered after being treated at a local hospital, but the government has temporarily withdrawn the license of chef, Takeshi Yasuge.

His license may be revoked for good, he could also e fined and even jailed.

A public health official said: 'The chef served a liver knowing that it is toxic, even if it was a request from the customer.'

Puffer fish or 'fugu' is an expensive 
Japanese delicacy but it must be prepared by specially trained chefs.

The trainee chefs have to undergo three years of training and apprenticeship before taking a
 test - that only a third are said to pass - before they are qualified to 
prepare a fish.

Licensed chefs are required to cut out toxic parts of the fish, including the liver and skin before serving it.

However, some aficionados ask to be served the banned parts, which are said to be a fine but dangerous delicacy.

Two star: Japanese restaurant Fugu Fukuji will retain it's Michelin rating

In 2009, scientists managed to breed a non-lethal species of fugu, however it failed to prove popular in specialist restaurants as purists who enjoy the thrill of eating something potentially dangerous said it ruined the appeal.

Historically, chefs who failed to prepare the dish correctly and caused the death of a customer were traditionally bound to commit ritual suicide with their own fish knife.

Several fatalities are reported from fugu poisoning every year, although most are of sport fishermen who think they know how to prepare their catch and end up poisoning themselves.

Michelin said it does not plan to change its rating of the restaurant, which was based on the dishes its agents ate, a company spokeswoman said.

Michelin this week released its latest Red Guide to the Tokyo area, which listed 247 establishments with at least one star.

The Japanese capital boasts 16 three-star eateries, six more than Paris.
