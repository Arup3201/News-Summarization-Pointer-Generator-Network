The Daily Mail in association with This Morning and Lloyds Pharmacy recently asked readers to nominate special people in the healthcare sector who’ve made a real difference to their life, or to a loved one.

After hundreds of votes, some well-known faces have also talked about their very own health heroes.

Here, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Trisha Goddard and Liz Dawn talk about the doctors who saved their lives.

Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes OBE had a heart attack and a consequent double heart bypass in 2003.

His Health Hero is his cardiac surgeon, Professor Gianni Angelini, 60, from Bristol Royal Infirmary.

Sir Ranulph says:

After I had a heart attack on an aeroplane at Bristol Airport I was taken by ambulance to Professor Angelini.

I was completely out of it and put on a 
life support machine because my heart wasn’t working - Professor 
Angelini’s on-going attempts to restart my heart went way beyond what 
could be expected.

In 2003 Sir Ranulph had a heart attack which resulted in him having to have a double heart bypass while on a life support machine

Three days later my heart still wouldn’t tick and he decided to perform a double bypass while I was still on life support.

It was only on this, the 13th attempt, that my heart started again, thanks to Professor Angelini sticking with it.

Apart from saving my life, he’s a real hero to me because when I then told him that in three months I needed to run seven marathons in seven days in seven continents, instead of doing what most doctors would do - not risk their reputation by allowing it - all he said was keep to 130 heartbeats per minute and do my best.

I did and I’m incredibly grateful to him for being that brave.

Since then I always call Professor Angelini for his opinion about expeditions I’m planning and he’s supported me on various challenges that could have impacted my heart, including two attempts on Mount Everest.

In 2009 he encouraged me to try Everest for a third time again because he knew previously I’d got within 350ft of the summit. That time I did do it and became the first old age pensioner to get there.

I feel very comfortable calling Professor Angelini whenever I need his help and I know he’ll make time for me.

I’ve heard so many other patients talking about the great things he’s done for the hospital, completely rejuvenating the cardiac wing by raising money and introducing new equipment and techniques. A large number of people in the Bristol area will directly benefit from his efforts.Talk show host Trisha Goddard, 55, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008.

Trisha’s Health Hero is Dr Simon Pain, 45, consultant general, breast and endocrine surgeon from Spire Norwich Private Hospital.

Trisha says:

Trisha Goddard's Health Hero is Dr Simon Pain who treated her when she had breast cancer

When Simon broke the awful news that I had breast cancer I sobbed for half a second – then I wanted to get on with surgery.

The nurses had suggested waiting a few weeks to operate but Simon understood me straightaway and booked me in for first thing the next day.

You see, I don’t ‘do ill’ very well and Simon realised that and tailored his approach to me completely around my needs.

I’ve suffered from depression in the past and following an extensive fitness regime has always helped to keep it under control.

Throughout my chemotherapy and radiotherapy one of my main concerns was the state of my mental health and it was very important to me to continue exercising and working on my talk show.

For most people with cancer, the approach is ‘sit down, take it easy’ - there’s not many doctors who go ‘ok, let’s help you work a 40-hour week, run, push weights and do kettlebell training three times a week’.

While Simon raised an eyebrow and said he’s never had any patients doing that before, he supported me and gave me practical advice to make it easier for me, rather than be discouraging - which, to me, is going over, above and beyond what he had to do.

He designed my treatment around my television production schedule and booked my radiotherapy appointments early in the morning because of work, I didn’t want anyone to see me and I wanted to be able to run to the appointment.

I don’t do pity and Simon got that. I’d hear women saying ‘my doctor’s so lovely, he held me while I cried’ – but that would have unscrewed me.

So Simon didn’t talk ill to me, he talked facts, he talked can do. His wonderful sense of humour and people skills made such a difference when I felt so low.

Above all this, he’s a wonderful surgeon and did a fantastic job with my lumpectomy so I didn’t need any reconstruction and left a brilliant scar. I recently had my five-year all-clear with Simon – even now that I’m working in the States, I won’t transfer to anyone else because I want to stay with him. Former Coronation Street actress Liz Dawn, 73, was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2002.

Her Health Hero Professor Ashley Woodcock, 61, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.

Liz says:

‘The first time I saw Professor Woodcock was in 2002 and I thought I was dying. I’d been so breathless on the set of Coronation Street so a nurse at Granada arranged for me to see him.

He sent me for tests at the Wythenshawe and after the results came back he told me only a third of my lungs were working.

I then realised that since 2000, when I used to panic and get breathless, it was due to a shortage of lung function so in fact he saved my life. I didn’t have the right medication before that.

Liz Dawn's health hero is Professor Ashley Woodcook at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester. He treats her lung disease

I’d been on a blue reliever inhaler for asthma but that’s the problem – there are about three million people in Britain that have got COPD (the collective name for lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease) and the blue inhaler isn’t working because they don’t realise that they’ve got more than asthma.

It’s a shame because had I been diagnosed properly before I think I’d be better now.

Liz Dawn says that when she first saw Professor Woodcock in 2002 she thought she was dying

But Professor Woodcock gave me the right medication, which helped my breathing and allowed me to stay on Coronation Street for five years after finding out about my lungs.

I’ve got four children and six grandchildren, I’ve got a place in Spain - I’ve since had a life other than work which I wouldn’t have had, had I not gone to see him that evening.

At first I had difficulty using my inhalers but he took me under his wing when I had problems and showed me how to use them.

He’s been incredibly supportive and I always know that I can depend on him. When you’ve got what I’ve got you can have good days and bad.

You’re not just cured and if you get cold or run down it can affect your breathing. Knowing that I can rely on him and that he can help me sort it out is very reassuring and I can ring him at any time, whenever I need him and I get through to him straightaway.

Professor Woodcock is really to the point and he doesn’t mess around. I take everything he says in - if he says do this or take this, I do it.

He also explains things in a way that’s easy to understand. His treatment has been amazing and he’s helped me to live another ten years.’
