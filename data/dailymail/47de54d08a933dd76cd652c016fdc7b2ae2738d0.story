An unprecedented lung virus that has infected over 1000 children across 10 states from the Midwest to the east coast is likely to spread to the rest of the country, doctors have warned.

Hospitals have reported unusually high numbers of children being admitted - some into intensive care - with the same viral symptoms, which usually start as a common cold before developing into severe respiratory distress.

Experts have not yet been able to officially identity the virus, however some cases have tested positive to Enterovirus D68 or EV-D68, a rare respiratory virus that typically causes asthma-like symptoms.

Suspected outbreaks have already been recorded in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Georgia, Mark Pallansch, the director of the Division of Viral Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told ABC News.

Widespread: The virus has already been reported across 10 states - Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Georgia - and is likely to spread, doctors say

Unprecedented: Some of the children taken to hospital have been admitted to intensive care with problems breathing

'It is only 10 states now, but it's going to be across the country,' ABC News Chief Health and Medical Editor Dr. Richard Besser told the station.

'So if your state doesn't have it now, watch for it, it's coming.'

Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Viral Diseases, told CNN that the cases already being treated are 'just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases'.

While enteroviruses are quite common, the EV-D68 is rare, but there is no data showing any deaths have been elated to an EV-D68 infection in the United States.

The first cases were reported in the Midwest in August.

In Kansas City, Missouri, about 450 children were treated at one facility - Children's Mercy Hospital - with at least 60 of them admitted to intensive care.

Children's Mercy Hospital's division director for Infectious Diseases, Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, said the problem was 'big' and 'unprecedented'.

Close call: The parents of Will Cornejo, 13, feared their son would not make it after he struggled to breath this week and was rushed to Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver. He is one of hundreds of children being admitted to hospital for respiratory distress

Feared the worst: Jennifer Corneyjo said she didn't know to what to expect after her son Will went white and his lips turned blue as he struggled to breath

'I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,' Dr. Jackson told CNN.

'We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses. It's big. I would call it unprecedented.

'It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care.'

Dr. Jackson said the problem started around when school went back on August 17 and peaked between August 21 and 30.

The CDC says that some 19 of the cases in Kansas City tested positive for Enterovirus D68.

There is no specific treatment for an EV-D68 infection.

Ventilation appears to be the best away to assist patients with the infection.

There is also no available vaccine.

'It's the worst I've seen in my time': Dr. Raju Meyeppan from Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver said he is worried about what will happen in winter

Intense: Will required a breathing for 24 hours to help get enough oxygen into his lungs

'The full scope is yet to be known, but it would appear it's in the Midwest,' Dr. Jackson said.

'In our community (in Kansas City), meticulous hand-washing is not happening.

'It's just the nature of kids. Worst I've seen.'

Symptoms include fever, body and muscles aches, sneezing, coughing and rash, CNN reported.

Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver reported five children in their intensive care unit and 20 more in the pediatric unit.

Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care after he came down with a cold last weekend.

His mother, Jennifer Corneyjo, said when her son took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, struggling to breath, she feared the worst.

'It was like nothing we've ever seen,' Jennifer Cornejo told CNN affiliate KUSA.

'He was unresponsive. He couldn't speak to me. He was turning white and his lips turned blue.'

Will needed a breathing aparatus for 24 hours.

Nationwide Children's Hopsital in East Columbus, Ohio, reported a 20 percent increase in patients with respiratory illness last weekend.

They are testing to see whether the cases are EV-D68.

Hannibal Regional Hospital in Hannibal, Missouri, said on Facebook they were dealth with 'recent outbreaks of enterovirus infections in Missouri and Illinois'.

Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois, saw more than 70 children with respiratory issues last weekend, according to CNN affiliate WGEM.
