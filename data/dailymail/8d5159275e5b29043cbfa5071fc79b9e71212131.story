Everton made almost twice as many passes as Swansea City during the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park - 605 to 304.

Jonjo Shelvey should spend the next three weeks thinking about how he can improve his discipline, according to Swansea manager Garry Monk.

Shelvey, signed by Liverpool at 18, was sent off in Swansea’s goalless draw at Everton and already has 22 yellow cards and two reds at the age of 22.

The midfielder will not be able to play for Swansea until their game at Manchester City on November 22 because the club’s next match against Arsenal, for which he is suspended, is followed by an international break.

Everton (4-2-3-1): Howard 6; Coleman 6.5, Alcaraz 5 (Besic 32min, 6), Jagielka 6, Baines 6; Barry 6.5, McCarthy 7.5; McGeady 7 (Lukaku 68, 6), Naismith 6 (Pienaar 68, 5.5), Barkley 6; Eto’o 5.5.

Subs not used: Robles, Hibbert, Atsu, Osman. Booked: Barry, Besic.

Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 5.5; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6.5, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 5.5, Shelvey 6; Routledge 6, Sigurdsson 6.5 (Carroll 75, 5.5), Montero 5.5 (Dyer 79); Bony 6.5 (Gomis 61, 6).

Subs not used: Tremmel, Gomis, Bartley, Shephard.

Booked: Bony, Williams, Sigurdsson.

Sent off: Shelvey.

Man of the match: James McCarthy.

Referee: Kevin Friend 6.

His first caution was for kicking the ball away to waste time, his second was for wrestling James McCarthy as the Everton player surged towards the penalty area.

‘His commitment isn’t in question but sometimes his judgment is,’ said Monk. ‘You have to be clever - you play with intensity but a cool head. It’s the first one, the sloppy ones, we can cut out.’

Monk had substituted the booked Wilfried Bony to prevent him being sent off and was thinking about doing the same for Shelvey when his 72nd-minute indiscretion saw him ordered off.

‘He has to learn very quickly,’ added the manager. ‘He’s got a few weeks to think about it.’

When Antolin Alcaraz went off with a shoulder injury after half an hour, Gareth Barry, 33, moved to centre half for the first time since he was a youngster at Aston Villa.

‘He represents everything we are at Everton,’ said boss Roberto Martinez.

Early signs suggest Alcaraz may be out for months, which could mean a return for Sylvain Distin, 36, who was not even on the bench.
