Forecasters have issued an ice warning for Britain's roads as an Arctic blast is set to send temperatures plummeting and up to four inches of snow in parts of Scotland this weekend. 

The blast will sweep in from northern Europe late on Sunday but Scotland's mountains, upland areas of northern England and the Welsh mountains will bear the brunt of the weather, which could last well into next week. 

A yellow 'be aware' Met Office warning for ice for the southwest of England and Wales is currently in place, advising road users that showers will continue to affect the area tonight, with further warnings issued for snow in Scotland on Sunday. 

Blizzards and icy roads will make driving conditions treacherous in snow-hit areas with widespread frost expected as temperatures continue to plummet as low as -5 in rural areas tomorrow.

Several centimetres of snow are expected to hit the Scottish mountains, and this morning, the skies were cloudy as the sun rose over the Cairngorm Mountains in the eastern Highlands of Scotland

As road temperatures continue to fall, ice may form where surfaces are left wet or damp.

It warned: 'Icy stretches may form on untreated surfaces on Friday evening and overnight into Saturday morning. The public should be aware of the potential for difficult driving conditions.' 

Cold air will move across the UK on Sunday, with frequent showers expected in parts of west Scotland in particular, said the Met Office. Snowy showers will fall above 200m with a mixture of hail and sleet as well at lower levels. 

Above 400m, Scotland's mountainous areas could see more than four inches of snow.  

Today, the first snow of the season fell over the the northern mountain ranges of the Lake District and in the Highlands of Scotland.

The snow descended upon the peaks of Helvellyn, Belncathra and Skiddaw this morning, heralding the start of winter weeks after the first dustings

usually appear.

This year's mild winter has delayed snow fall by around a month, with temperatures only just cold enough to allow it to stick.

A Met office spokesperson said: 'Temperatures plummeted to around one degrees Celsius in Keswick, Cumbria, last night which is cold enough to see

snow.

'The temperature drops by one degree for every 100 metres of altitude, so it will have been even colder at the top of the mountains.

'This is the first snow of the season. We normally see sleet and snow in November, but not this year.'

Rachel Vince, senior forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: 'Scotland and Northern Ireland will see a mixture of sunshine and showers tomorrow.

'These showers do look like becoming hail and sleet showers in places, with snow in the mountains.'

The Met Office currently has a weather warning for ice in place for Scotland and Northern Ireland for tomorrow morning. Further weather warnings of snow are in place for western Scotland for Sunday and Monday.

Mark Wilson, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said travellers should be careful of ice tomorrow morning, with a night of rain and clear skies potentially leading to dangerous driving conditions.

He said tomorrow would be largely cloudy across the UK, although some sunny spells could be expected. Temperatures are expected to drop again tomorrow night, with the mercury plummeting to as low as -5C in some rural parts.

Mr Wilson said the forecast for Saturday looked slightly better, with largely dry, sunny spells and a slight increase in temperatures.

However, another band of rain is set to sweep across the country on Saturday night and temperatures are again set to plummet to below zero.

He said the colder temperatures and increased rainfall meant there was a 'more significant possibility' of snow falling on Sunday night.

He said accumulations of snowfall were predicted to be between 10cm and 20cm in western Scotland, over high ground, while up to 10cm could fall across the rest of Britain.

Ms Vince agreed there could be a possibility of snow on Sunday and added: 'The Scottish mountains could see several centimetres (of snow) by the end of the weekend.'

The Met Office's weather warnings in place for tomorrow, Sunday and Monday warn of 'widespread icy patches' and the risk of ice on untreated surfaces following overnight rain.

Forecasters warned of travel disruption due to the adverse weather conditions and added: 'Accumulating snow may lead to travel disruption through the region.

'The public should be aware of the potential for disruption to travel on Sunday and into Monday morning.'
