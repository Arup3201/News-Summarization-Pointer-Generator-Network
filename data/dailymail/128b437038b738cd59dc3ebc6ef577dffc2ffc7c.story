Somewhere inside the Pentagon sits a notoriously tight-lipped man whose words Defense Department top brass take as gospel and whose mysterious office exists to predict the future.

Andrew W. Marshall, 92, is nicknamed Yoda both for his bald head and uncanny ability to foresee advancements in military technology and warfare strategy decades in advance and has done so for the Office of Net Assessment since Richard Nixon gave his the agency’s top job back in 1973.

And though Marshall has accurately predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, the rise of China, and the advent of drone warfare, and is credited with helping end the Cold War, the ‘Pentagon’s futurist-in-chief’ could see his entire office axed if some bureaucrats get their way.

Mysterious, he is: Andrew W. Marshall, 92, (left) is known as Yoda (right) to Pentagon top brass because of his bald head and uncanny ability to predict what the state of warfare will be 20 to 30 years in the future

For the last twenty years, Yoda has been
using the force to contemplate scenarios of an American war with China,
a nation whose military spending could outpace our own within 20 years.

As for predictions, he's said that performance enhancing drugs will one day very soon be just as important as technological developments.

'People who are connected with neural pharmacology tell me that new classes of drugs will be available relatively shortly, certainly within the decade,' Marshall told Wired in an extremely rare interview from 2003.

Marshall has given very few interviews over the years and very rarely allows himself to be quoted in the press.

'One of the people I talk to jokes that a future intelligence problem is going to be knowing what drugs the other guys are on,' he said.

He's proven his predictive prowess with the fall of the Soviet Union, which he helped catalyze, and managed to keep his office afloat through every presidency since Nixon's.

But on October 15, Defense News reported that Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and his department were considering getting rid of the internal think tank in light of serious budget cuts.

Marshall is so revered in the 
tight, smoke-filled circles in which he’s traveled for 40 years, however, that critical voices have chosen to remain nameless.

Prescient: Here, Marshall receives the 2008 Presidential Citizens Medal from President George W. Bush. Since 1973, Marshall has navigated the highest and most secretive circles of the U.S. military thanks to his remarkable abilities

Nixonian: This photo was taken in 1973, the same year President Richard Nixon gave Marshall the reigns to the Pentagon's newly formed Office of Net Assessment, an in-house think tank formed to predict the state of warfare 20-30 years in the future

And its mysteriousness is working against it.

‘You
can’t quite tell what the nation is getting out of it,’ a former senior
defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the 
Washington Post.

That’s
because reports out of Marshall’s office—which cover everything from 
potential nuclear strike outcomes, to energy use in Asia, to U.S. 
military superiority and any number of warfare and security topics—are 
so classified that the only person who can read many of them in the 
Defense Department is the Secretary of Defense himself.

Even officials speaking on the record aren’t saying much on the subject.

‘The
Department of Defense is currently assessing our missions, structure 
and programs in light of an evolving set of strategic challenges, as 
well as a constrained fiscal environment,’ Lieutenant Colonel Damien 
Pickart, a Pentagon spokesman, told the Post in a statement. ‘It would 
be premature to comment on pre-decisional issues.’

Regardless of his office’s usefulness as a whole, no one seems to deny Marshall’s personal gifts as a gazer into the politico-military world of tomorrow.

‘Mr. Marshall’s brain is highly networked,’ John Arquilla, Navy professor who has known Marshall for decades, told the Post while praising his ‘mental suppleness.’

His age, Arquialla said, isn’t an issue, either:

‘His mind is as sharp as ever. He’s gotten not just a second wind but a third wind in recent years.’

Uncertain future: Chuck Hagel and the Department of Defense have considered giving Marshall and his office the axe due to budget cuts, but a high powered group of Washington insider quickly rallied around their 'futurist-in-chief'

Also among his fans is China’s General Chen Zhou, who last week said in an interview with the Economist: ‘We studied RMA exhaustively. Our great hero was Andy Marshall in the Pentagon. We translated every word he wrote.’

RMA stands for revolution in military affairs, a theory favored by Marshall that basically states that warfare technology develops in short and intermittent but transformative spurts—think bows and arrows to cannons to atomic bomb.

While some say he’s exaggerated such a possibility in order to keep his obscure office funded, other say this sort of thing is exactly why America needs Marshall.

One lawmaker pushing to keep the office around is Representative J. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican.

‘Given the critical contributions to U.S. national security made by the office during its forty-year history and its role as a central repository for long-range strategic thinking, we believe it would be a serious error to further consider its abolition.’ said Forbes, who is Chairman of the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee.

A bigger name fighting for Marshall himself is a man who worked closely with the ONA during his own tenure at the Pentagon.

‘Forefront of strategy & transformation @DeptofDefense for 40yr, to cut Andy Marshall & ONA would be a serious mistake,’ tweeted former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld October 19.

Buried somewhere deep within the Pentagon, the office's purpose is to look 20 to 30 years into the military's future and produce reports about vulnerabilities and opportunities

Only the Secretary of Defense is privy to the group's top secret findings, but some bureaucrat say its time to axe the agency
