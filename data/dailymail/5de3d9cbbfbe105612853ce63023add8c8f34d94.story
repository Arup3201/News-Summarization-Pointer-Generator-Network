A young mother moved into her new home to find it daubed in racist graffiti and a threatening note put through to door saying the flat block was for 'black sisters and brothers'.

Sammie Sunter, 24, was taking her sons, aged two and five, to see their new home in Willenhall, Coventry, for the first time on Monday when they found the front door smeared in anti-vandal paint.

It was also covered in vile graffiti and faeces, while a racist note stating 'Willenhall is black so f*** off' was posted through the letterbox.

One of the notes that was put through the letterbox had been written over a Coventry City Council letter and said: 'We are watching you white b****. Africa rules'

The note had been put inside an envelope marked 'Message inside oyinbo b****' - Nigerian slang for a white person, while another message inside read: 'Black power. Don't stay too long or else...'.

The hairdresser was handed the keys from housing association, Whitefriars, last Wednesday and spent the rest of the week decorating the boys' bedrooms.

She left the flat at 4pm on Sunday and returned with two-year-old Harvey and five-year-old Oscar, at 9am on Monday morning to see her house had been targeted.

Ms Sunter said: ' I had to explain racism to my five-year-old. It's just not acceptable. He didn't really understand. If we are equal what gives the person responsible the right to do that?

The door had been covered in black anti-vandal paint and smeared in faeces when Ms Sunter arrived at their new home with her two boys

'I told him that whoever was responsible was going to get punished, but who knows if that will happen.'

The mother-of-two, who is due to be re-housed following the incident, has lived in Willenhall for 15 years and said she has never experienced anything like this before. 

'These people make Willenhall out to be some sort of ghetto,' Sammie said. 'They say it's their area but it's really not - there's a little old white man living in the flat below.

'The whole point of this is that it's not right. I'm not going to sit there and take it.

'I had to have a police escort away from my property and I knew I was being watched. You hold your head up high but it's disgusting.'

When she called the housing association she was told that there had been a 'previous incident' at the address.

'Whitefriars were the first people I rang when this happened and when I spoke to someone they said they didn't think it would happen again,' she said.

'I think they have allowed this to happen. If it's happened before, and they have neglected to tell me, then they have put me and my children in danger.'

The incident was reported to West Midlands Police, who said it was treating the attack as racially aggravated criminal damage and it was being taken 'very seriously'.

Officers have made door-to-door inquiries while forensics experts are studying the note and they are also liaising with Whitefriars.

Police are hopeful that because the flat looks out onto a busy street, there will have been some witnesses.

Carmel McCarthy, director of housing and neighbourhood services, said: 'We absolutely deplore the actions reported and are working closely with the police to identify the culprit and to press for the strongest possible actions to be taken against them.

'There had been a previous incident reported at the property, which we passed on to the police for investigation. We closely monitor these events and in this case it appeared to be a one-off incident.

Another threatening note said 'These flat are for black sisters and brothers. Willenhall is black so f*** off'

The envelope put through the door had the word 'oyinbo' on - which is Nigerian slang for white person, and a drawing of a gun

'Black power. Don't stay to long or else...': Police are treating the incident 'very seriously' and has conducted door-to-door investigations

'As soon as Ms Sunter drew this incident to our attention, we offered her another home, which she will be moving into shortly.

'We have been working closely with Ms Sunter and the police on this incident and will continue to do so.

'Whitefriars always seeks to take strong action against any and all hate crime and we have close links with the police who work with us to investigate and prosecute these types of incidents.'

Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
