Police are searching for a woman who is brazenly stealing packages from doorsteps in a Dallas, Texas neighborhood.

Surveillance cameras outside two separate homes have captured the woman climbing out of a car, casually approaching the front of the house, snatching mail and then jumping back in the vehicle.

One couple, Missy and Ken Clinchy, shared their footage on Facebook and are offering a $100 reward for any information that leads them to the identity of the thief.

Mrs Clinchy said she was expecting three packages to be outside her home but when she returned, they were not there - and on looking at the surveillance footage, she was stunned by what she saw.

Brazen: A woman can be seen casually strolling towards a house in Dallas on surveillance footage

Thief: A moment later, she returns to the waiting car carrying a large package picked up from the porch

'I just started freaking out,' she told NBC. '"Oh my gosh, they stole our packages!"'

Her husband added: 'I think we were shocked at how casual she was walking up to the door.'

When they posted the video online, they discovered another piece of footage from another resident who lives 10 minutes away showing the same woman - in the same clothes - stealing packages.

From that home, she stole an electric smoker that had been outside the home for an hour.

The Clinchys said the package stolen from their home came from Amazon and contained some Christmas presents and dog food, but they fear for other families.

'While I am upset about the stuff someone stole from us, I've heard someone had their wedding invitations stolen,' Mrs Clinchy wrote, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Not the first time: Another security camera outside a home 10 minutes away, caught her stealing three packages from the doorstep on the same day. The owners are now appealing for information

Victims: Missy and Ken Clinchy said they were stunned at how casual the woman appeared on the tape

'Someone else had [personalized] gifts for their kids stolen, and they can't replace them in time for Christmas. I put myself in their shoes. Our stuff can be replaced. But I don't want this to happen to someone else with stuff that really means something to them.'

The couple hopes by posting the footage on social media, someone will recognize the woman.

She is seen climbing out of the passenger door, suggesting she is working with someone else. 

Police are now searching for the woman. If you have any information about the thefts, contact Detective Evans at 214-670-6179.
