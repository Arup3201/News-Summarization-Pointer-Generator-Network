Your success at playing a musical instrument could be down to a fatty substance in your brain.

Scientists have discovered that an electrically insulating substance known as myelin is essential to our brains learning new skills.

They claim that when a skill, such as playing the piano, is learned later in life, myelin must be made in order to retain the skill.

However, researchers at University College London claim that once a new skill has been learnt, it is retained even after myelin production stops.

They found myelin was produced by the brain and spinal cord into early adulthood as it is needed for many developmental processes.

Although earlier studies of white matter hinted at its involvement in skill learning, the study is the first to confirm it experimentally.

Lab mice tests showed that new myelin must be made each time a skill is learned later in life and the structure of the brain's white matter changes during new practical activities by increasing the number of myelin-producing cells.

These discoveries could prove important in finding ways to stimulate and improve learning, and in understanding myelin's involvement in other brain processes such as in cognition, the study published in Science suggested.

When a child learns to walk or an adult masters a new skill such as juggling, new brain circuit activity is needed and new connections are made across large distances and at high speeds between different parts of the brain and spinal cord.

Myelin is a fatty material that coats and insulates nerves.

It is sometimes compared to the insulating material around an electrical wire.

Its job is to quickly conduct impulses between the brain and different parts of the body.

The result is faster reactions to danger and a better chance of survival.  

It is made up of around 40 per cent water, while its dry mass is around 20 per cent protein.

Flaws in making myelin result in a number of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS).

For this, electrical signals fire between neurons connected by 'axons' - thread-like extensions of their outer surfaces which can be viewed as the 'wire' in the electric circuit.

When new signals fire repeatedly along axons, the connections between the neurons strengthen, making them easier to fire in the same pattern in future.

Neighbouring myelin-producing cells called oligodendrocytes (OLs) recognise the repeating signal and wrap myelin around the active circuit wiring.

It is this activity-driven insulation that the team identified as essential for learning.

But while the study showed young adult mice need to make myelin to learn new motor skills, new myelin does not need to be produced to recall and perform a pre-learned skill.

The theory was established when normal mice and mice which had their their ability to produce OLs and myelin switched off were made to run on an irregular spaced wheel.

The 'abnormal' mice could not master the wheel.

But when 'normal' mice used the wheel but were then switched off, they could still master the wheel.

Professor Bill Richardson, Director of the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, said: 'From earlier studies of human white matter using advanced MRI technology, we thought OLs and myelin might be involved in some way in skill learning, so we decided to attack this idea experimentally.

'We were surprised how quickly we saw differences in the ability of mice from each group to learn how to run on complex wheel, which shows just how fast the brain can respond to wrap newly-activated circuits in myelin and how this improves learning.

'This rapid response suggests that a number of alternative axon pathways might already exist in the brain that could be used to drive a particular sequence of movements, but it quickly works out which of those circuits is most efficient and both selects and protects its chosen route with myelin.

'We think these findings are really exciting as they open up opportunities to investigate the role of OLs and myelin in other brain processes, such as cognitive activities like navigating through a maze, to see if the requirement for new myelin is general or specific to motor activity.

'I'm keen to find out the precise sequence of changes to OLs and myelin during learning and whether these changes are needed more in some parts of the brain than others, which might shed light on some of the mysteries still surrounding how the brain adapts and learns throughout life.'
