The president of Kentucky State University (KSU) wants his employees to get a raise so badly, he's willing to give up 90,000 of his own salary to make sure they do.

Raymond Burse, 63, once was president of KSU from 1982 to 1989 and agreed to return again under one condition: that the school's clerical and maintenance workers get a raise from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 up to $10.10.

'It was something I was in a position to do, and it was something I wanted to do,' Burse told CBS.

Giver: Raymond Burse thinks low-paid workers at Kentucky State University deserve a raise, and he's personally willing to give up more than $90,000 to make sure they get one

'I told the board I was billing to work for less provided that what I gave up would raise employees from $7.25 an hour to $10.10,' he continued.

The board agreed to the change and he agreed to act as the school's president.

Burse graduated from Harvard Law School and after working at KSU in the 1980s he went on to work for General Electric for 17 years.

Now that he's back at the University after retiring in 2012 from his position as corporate officer and general counsel of its appliances and lighting division, he's aimed at helping his staff.

'You can live [on $7.25 an hour], but it's hard living, tough living,' he said.

'It forces individuals to make a choice between some necessities of life and the things they want to do. We want our employees to have a better life.

In return, I expect them to make a commitment to the institution and to help us with what we need to do to move education forward at KSU.'

Even though Burse got attention following his decision to raise his worker's salaries to $21,000 per year he says he didn't do it for the press.

'I didn't do this for PR,' he said

'What I did, I did for the employees of Kentucky State University.'

Burse wouldn't say whether or not he thought the government should raise the federal minimum wage.

Second presidency: Burse recently returned to lead the university after having previously headed it from 1982 to 1989
