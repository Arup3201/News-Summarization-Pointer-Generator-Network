The Supreme Court has put same-sex marriages on hold in Utah while a federal appeals court further considers the issue.

The court issued a brief order on Monday morning blocking any new same-sex unions in the heavily Mormon state.

It comes after an emergency appeal following the ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby last month that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage violated gay and lesbian couples' constitutional rights.

More than 900 gay and lesbian couples have married since the decision.

But in papers filed last week, the state asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor to overturn it. Sotomayor handles emergency requests from Utah and other Rocky Mountain states.

'Numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah,' lawyers said in the filing.

'Each one is an affront not only to the interests of the state and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this court's unique role as final arbiter.'

The high court order will remain in effect until the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decides whether to uphold Shelby's ruling.

Judge Shelby's decision on December 20
 came as a shock to many in the state, which approved the ban on 
same-sex marriage in 2004.

His
 decision, which came on a Friday, sent people rushing to a county 
clerk's office in Salt Lake City - about 3 miles from the headquarters 
of the Mormon church - for marriage licenses.

The following Monday, 353 more gay and lesbian couples grabbed a license, some camping out overnight to get in line early the next morning.

Nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles.

The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8.

The church says it stands by its support 
for 'traditional marriage' and hopes a higher court validates its belief
 that marriage is between a man and woman.

In the papers filed last week, Utah argues that children are best raised by a mother and father in a good relationship.

'On average children navigate developmental stages more easily, perform better academically, have fewer emotional disorders and become better functioning adults when reared in that environment,' it says.

It insists that states have the authority to define marriage as between a man and woman.

'That
 states have a powerful interest in controlling the definition of 
marriage within their borders is indisputable,' Utah said in the filing.
