Liam Bridcutt has completed a £2.5million move to Sunderland from Brighton, becoming Gus Poyet's fifth signing of the transfer window.

The midfielder on Thursday travelled up to Wearside to discuss personal terms with the Black Cats and completed his move on Friday morning.

Brighton had rejected a transfer request from the 24-year-old earlier this month but were unable to prevent him from signing for Poyet's side.

Bridcutt had been at at the Amex Stadium since 2010, when he joined the club on a free transfer from Chelsea.

Meanwhile, Albion boss Oscar Garcia has drafted in Spanish forward David Rodriguez from Celta Vigo.

Brighton have also been watching midfielder Dale Stephens as a potential replacement for Bridcutt but Charlton have rebuffed an offer.

Starting at Chelsea, Bridcutt had loan spells with Yeovil, Watford and Stockport County before being allowed to leave on a free transfer to Brighton in 2010.

Impressing at the Amex in the engine room of midfield, the Scot was called up to the national side for the first time for the 2-0 World Cup qualifying defeat by Serbia in March last year.

Bridcutt made 132 appearances for Brighton, scoring twice and was part of their 2010-11 League One promotion-winning side.

Bridcutt, who will wear the No 23 shirt, had not played for the south-coast club since submitting a transfer request earlier this month after the Black Cats formalised their interest in him.

The midfielder, who made his Scotland debut against Serbia last year, joins fellow January signings Marcos Alonso, Santiago Vergini, Oscar Ustari and Ignacio Scocco at the Stadium of Light.

Poyet needs to clear the decks and bring some money in too to keep owner Ellis Short happy, and Lee Cattermole could be leaving for Stoke City.

Despite Mark Hughes’ surprise that the proposed deal has caused Poyet so much consternation – ‘I don’t know where that came from,’ he said on Wednesday – there is interest in the former Sunderland captain according to first team coach Charlie Oatway.

Speaking at the weekend, Cattermole 
said: ‘I will definitely be a Sunderland player on Wednesday. I've heard
 no different and the manager has come out and said he has heard no 
different. I will be back in training on Monday. 

‘I am contracted to Sunderland. They make the decisions not me.

‘It's
 out of my hands. I'm contracted here for the rest of the season and 
another two years. It's out of my hands. Until I know any different, I 
will keep working. I have got a cup final to play in – if I'm here – and
 that would be brilliant.’

As well as making five signings this window, Sunderland snapped up 13 players last summer under Gus Poyet's predecessor Paolo di Canio. Including the five this window, that's 18 altogether.

Here's the full list of Sunderland's movers and shakers:

Summer signings 2013: Vito Mannone, Emanuele Giaccherini, Jozy Altidore, Fabio Borini, Ki Yeung-sung, Andrea Dossena, Charis Mavrias, El Hadji Ba, David Moberg Karlsson, Ondrej Celustka, Jozy Altidore, Modibo Diakite, Duncan Watmore

January signings 2014: Marcos Alonso, Santiago Vergini, Oscar Ustari, Ignacio Scocco, Liam Bridcutt
