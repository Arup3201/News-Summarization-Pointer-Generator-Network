Jose Mourinho admits that Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech is not fully happy with his current role as Blues No 2.

The keeper was dropped in place of Thibaut Courtois against Burnley on Monday and the Belgian youngster looks set to retain his position for Chelsea's clash against Leicester on Saturday.

Discussing Cech's situation, Mourinho said: 'He's a top professional, working as always, he is a Chelsea person.

'I don't believe he's totally happy, but that's him. 

'It's hard because at the moment it's one match a week. But in September there's the Capital One Cup, Champions League and Premier League, there will be rotation so everyone feels better. 

'Petr's behaviour is fantastic'

The Chelsea boss added that although keeping all of his players happy is a difficult task, it becomes much easier if the team are winning. 

He added: 'It's easier if you win. If you play one match a week it's easier for the players to feel there is first and second choice players. It's different when there's three games a week.'

JOSE MOURINHO'S PRESS CONFERENCE AS IT HAPPENED 

Host commentator

That's all we will be hearing from Mourinho today. A full write up of the best bits will follow shortly...

We have to think about the players and the players deserve respect. The club is the most important, then the team, then the players. But if you can make it good for club team and players. That's he perfect scenario.

Injuries

Everyone fit

Is it hard to keep players happy?

It's easier if you win. If you play one match a week its easier for the players to feel there is first and second choice players. Its different when there's three games a week.

It's difficult, they are champions they have a winning mentality. They know every point is important. They had a difficult start against Everton

 

I want to respect Dermot. Everytime a job opens there's always loads of candidates.

I hope Tony Pulis can come back quickly. I hope Palace makes the right choice for them.

 

On Balotelli...

I don't comment about him. The only thing I say is I always wish my former players the best.

Malky MackayI won't comment, between Malky and his lawyers.

It's the 6th Premier League I start. I don't think I had a lot to learn. Every match is difficult. The results in the first round of matches were very clear.

We are calm in the transfer market. My club did a fantastic job. We are calm. For us there is no tick tocking of the transfer clock.

Cech is coping.

Top pro, working as always, he is a Chelsea person. I

I don't believe he's totally happy, but that's him. Its hard because at the moment it's one match a week.

But in sept there's capital cup CL, PL, there will be rotation so everyone feels better. Petr behaviour is fantastic.
