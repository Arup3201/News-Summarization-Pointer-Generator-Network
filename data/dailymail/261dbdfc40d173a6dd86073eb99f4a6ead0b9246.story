He said: 'My biggest worry when I have a quiet moment to myself is where am I going to find a wallet big enough to take it all home with.'

He added: 'The reality is that I've got so much money I don't know where to put it. It's enough to make you cry, in Romania I never had any money and now I have so much I can't even carry at all. I wouldn't be able to walk if I tried to stuff it in my trouser pocket.

The Romanian said he moved to London in the past few years where he was able to get work as a bodyguard quickly graduating up to celebrity clients. 

Between 2011 and 2012 he was the bodyguard for former cage fighter Alex Reid.

He was close to  Katie Price's ex-husband  and is known to have socialised with him and Chantelle Houghton, who won the Celebrity Big Brother in 2006.

He earned his nickname The Redneck with a Maserati after was spotted driving one of the top of the range cars and living in a penthouse in the UK.

The bodyguard is said to tell his clients he is so scary he even frightens himself when he looks in the mirror.

Petre has posted pictures of himself driving expensive cars and living in a VIP apartment.

But some have claimed that   the car belonged to one of his employers and the house also didn't belong to him.

But in the cash video, from October last year, he said: 'I have a tip for my critics, if you come London buy an umbrella because it rains a lot. As every British person knows it's bad luck to open the umbrella inside a house, so I won't do it, and in my house it only rains with money anyway.'
