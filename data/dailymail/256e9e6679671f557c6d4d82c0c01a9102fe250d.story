10-year-old Izzedine lives with his family in a two-room container in a refugee camp located on the Turkish border with Syria.

One of an estimated 1.5 million Syrian child refugees, his brother Omar, just 15, is often away fighting with the Free Syrian Army, while his father, badly injured two years ago, remains in camp.

But while the plight of Syrian refugees is well documented, less well-known is the impact the experience has had on the children - in Izzedine's case, a shockingly adult hatred of the Assad regime and ambitions to 'do jihad'.

Devastating: Baraa, eight, from Homs, saw her mother's body after she was decapitated in a missile attack

Fighter: Izzadine, 10, lives in a refugee camp on the Turkish border and says he is 'ready for jihad'

'When
[the Syrian uprising] started, we went out to protest in the streets,' he says. 'I was still seven 
years old and I would keep crying and telling my father I am ready for 
jihad.

'Now I am older, I am ready for jihad.'

Sadly, as a new BBC documentary makes clear, Izzedine's shocking confession is by no means unique - and neither is his attitude confined to the rebel side.

Another child to appear is 14-year-old Jalel Suleiman who lives in Damascus with his father who is currently fighting for one of the Assad regime's 'neigbourhood defence units'.

Like Ezzadine, he displays a disturbingly adult appreciation of the situation, speaking endlessly of the need to 'defend the homeland' and of his pride in his 'martyred' uncle.

'Of course we all worry about my father but like anyone who loves his country, he must make a sacrifice and give his life for Syria,' adds the teenager.

'You
 won't find a country better than ours. I'd tell [rebel supporters] to return home and 
live with us in peace or they'll suffer the same fate as these armed groups.'

Clearly, the Syrian conflict, which has so far ground on for more than three years and claimed more than 150,000 lives, will not be ending any time soon.

But in a frightening glimpse of what might be around the corner, many of the children interviewed by the BBC's Lyse Doucet spoke of wanting to take revenge on the opposing force or, as in Izzedine's case, become jihadis.

'I
 would like to go back to school and become a teacher one day,' says Izzedine's fighter brother Omar.

'But I was
 not lucky and now all I have in my head is never to drop my weapon 
until Bashar [al-Assad] falls.

'I feel that I'll be martyred, God willing. I am not 
afraid for myself because I know I'll be a martyr. It's better to start a war and get killed rather than live like animals under the regime's control.'

'We made this film because we realised that by listening more closely to the children, we would see the shape of a country's future - and it's a troubling one.,' revealed Doucet in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'Children are not just cute or compelling sidebars in the worst wars of our time; they are front and centre on the frontline.'

One girl who knows all about life on the frontline is eight-year-old Baraa from Homs, the scene of some of the worst fighting the war has seen so far.

Baraa, who lives in the old quarter, was trapped behind rebel lines during a government siege and was forced to eat the family pet, a cat, to survive.

Haunted: Daad still dreams about the friends who were killed when her village was shelled by rebels

Worse still, her mother and brother were killed by a missile strike, the little girl catching a glimpse of her parent's decapitated body before her father was able to take it away.

'The
 siege was really difficult,' she remembers. 'We ate cats. We had about 40 rats in our 
home and a cat. She would eat them all.

'Then a month later, they 
slaughtered her too. They sent some of it to us. They didn't tell us 
what it was at first. We ate it and the next day, they told us it was 
cat meat.'

Others, such as 11-year-old Daad Sebbagh who lives in Damascus, say they are haunted by the faces of the friends they've lost - in Daad's case, her playmates from her home village which was flattened by rebels in the early days of the war.

'We were sleeping when the shelling 
started,' she says. 'My mother and father lay on top of us to protect us.

'Men came 
and woke us up at 4am, grabbed us from behind and took us downstairs. 
When they did that to us, we were terrified.

'We saw two men taking my 
parents out of the house. They did that because all the surrounding 
houses were flattened. When we left the house, it collapsed.'

The bombardment killed many of the villagers and two years on, Daad is still haunted by their deaths.

Fighting: The war in Syria has raged for more than three years and has killed an estimated 150,000 people

'In my 
dreams, I go back to my old town and I see the ghosts of my friends. I 
see them and I see people who were shot, who are still alive. I wake up 
and can't go back to sleep.'

Tragic though Daad's story is, what worries Doucet is what will happen when she and the other children grow up.

'We were shocked by how children as 
young as nine years old spoke passionately of seeking revenge,' she says.

'We were 
saddened by children who spoke of their shame that they knew more about 
weapons, then writing and reading.'

Fighter Omar appears to confirm her fears. 'I'm 99 per cent sure the war in Syria won't end,' says the teen. 'It will continue to the end of days. Generations will continue to fight on.'
