After the trophy had been presented and the players had finished spraying Arsene Wenger with champagne, I went down on to the Wembley pitch to say my congratulations.

The last time Arsenal won a trophy — in 2005 — I hadn’t even been that bothered about going to the game and I certainly didn’t feel emotional. After all, Arsenal were used to winning trophies all the time. On Saturday, I did feel emotional and I wouldn’t have missed being there for the world.

I was with Mo Farah, who is a huge Arsenal fan, and we spotted Wenger so went over to say hello. He looked a bit dishevelled as he’d just been given the bumps by his players and had to change out of his suit and into a tracksuit. I said to him that he looked like he’d just run a marathon.

Emotional: Arsenal ended nine years without a trophy by beating Hull at Wembley

He wore a huge grin. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happier. I think he was just delighted to be answering questions about winning a trophy — he probably wondered if it would ever happen again.

At 2-0, I was worried for him, concerned that his reputation wouldn’t recover from losing such a game. Instead, the team found a way to win and now Wenger is a winner again. That’s what trophies do.  People were doubting whether he still had it in him but here was proof that he did.

I also spoke to Aaron Ramsey, who has without doubt become Arsenal’s No 1 player, the first name on the team-sheet. Last season he was trying too hard at times but the improvement has been vast.

He refused to accept that Arsenal would lose and kept taking the game to Hull,  making runs in behind them again and again. The winning goal was down to his persistence and was a fantastic finish.

First step: But the Gunners must continue to win

Delighted: Arsene Wenger answered a lot of critics with the FA Cup win

I told him that the game will forever be remembered as the ‘Ramsey Final’ and that he’s gone down in history. He’s scored 16 goals this season and, amazingly, came back from injury playing at the same high standard as earlier in the season.

Yet he could have been in goal facing penalties in a shootout too if Lukasz Fabianski had made contact with Sone Aluko, 40 yards out, in those crazy closing moments.

Thomas Vermaelen is worthy of a mention too. He was once again left out of the team but you wouldn’t have known it from his celebrations. He showed true dignity and class as club captain — there was not a hint of bitterness in his behaviour.

The players will be desperate to win more trophies now. I didn’t win my first until 1998 — I was injured for the 1994 Cup-winners’ Cup final — and the waiting weighs heavily. But then you just become hungry for a repeat and try even harder.

No 1: Aaron Ramsey has grown to become Arsenal's most important player

Agonising: Sone Aluko saw a late, late chance cleared off the line by Kieran Gibbs

To do that, Arsenal will have to add to their squad. Yes, they are a maturing group of players but fans spend their hard-earned cash each week on tickets and merchandise and they want to see it invested in the transfer market.

Signing Mesut Ozil in some way reunited the fans and the club, and they will expect the same again. Football is not just about being competitive on the pitch, but being competitive off it.

Bacary Sagna looks likely to leave and Vermaelen and Johan Djourou could follow. Wenger must decide whether to make Carl Jenkinson his right back or buy a replacement. That could mean buying three defenders when they would surely rather spend money improving things at the other end.

Dignified: Club captain Thomas Vermaelen acted in a brilliant manner despite being left out

Potential: Mesut Ozil needs to play with a striker who has the pace and willingness to latch onto his passes

Olivier Giroud has done very well, netting 22 times, but his place needs to be under more pressure. Arsenal need a world-class centre forward who can offer something different from Giroud —  someone with real pace who can run in behind defences.  Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka used to fill that role.

With the right target, Ozil and Santi Cazorla will cause havoc, picking him out time after time. At the moment, especially with Theo Walcott injured, Arsenal are too reliant on Ramsey’s runs from deep. 

Added to that should be a tough-tackling midfielder. Yes, half the Premier League is looking for the next Yaya Toure or Nemanja Matic, but Arsenal need to find him.

As good as Olivier Giroud has been, Arsenal need a striker in the Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka mould - that will make Mesut Ozil better
