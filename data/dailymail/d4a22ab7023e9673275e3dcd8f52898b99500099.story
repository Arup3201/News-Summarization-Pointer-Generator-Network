A recently-published study has found a nearly 16 percent boost in HIV cases due to Craigslist popping up in a new area.

The study, 'Internet's Dirty Secret: Assessing the Impact of Online Intermediaries on HIV Transmission,' was published in MIS Quarterly in December last year.

Assistant Professor of Information and Decision Sciences Jason Chan - who works at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management - and Professor Aninya Ghose - who works at New York University's Stern School of Business - were the study's authors.

A release published by the University of Minnesota said, 'When mapped at the national level, more than 6,000 HIV cases annually and treatment costs estimated between $62 million and $65.3 million can be linked to the popular website.'

'I actually think that the creators of Craigslist had no intent of harming society,' Chan said in the release. 'They came in with good intentions. At the same time, they did not anticipate that users could use the features in an unexpected way with unintended consequences.'

The Star Tribune reported that Chan's inspiration stemmed from when 'he’d read about a doctor who traced sexually transmitted diseases to online chat rooms.'

Chan told the newspaper 'I went to Craigslist in New York and went through the ads. To my shock, I found out almost all the ads were hookup ads. They were very explicit.'

Information spanning nine years from 1998 to 2008 and in 33 different states was used, according to the University of Minnesota.

Its release also revealed that 'the researchers discovered that the upward shift was influenced by ads in Craigslist’s personals sections, not the site’s escort service ads. This finding was in line with existing research that shows internet-facilitated sex workers are less likely to participate in risky sexual practices with clients.'

The Star Tribune reported that 'The study found that HIV incidence began to increase about a year after Craigslist entered a market, then climbed through the study period.' 

The newspaper explained that the study could not separate types of personal ads available.

Chan told the newspaper 'My suspicion is most of this [effect] is coming from the M for M section. We do know that anal sex is a large reason why HIV is spread. It’s also prevalent in the gay community. It makes sense that this group is the most likely to be affected.'

Craigslist did not immediately return a message seeking comment from Daily Mail Online.
