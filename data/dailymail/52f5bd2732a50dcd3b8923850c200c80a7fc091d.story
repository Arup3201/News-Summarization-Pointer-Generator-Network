Two-week-old  Elleah-Jayne Knight-Holmes won't have to worry about having female roles models to turn to as she grows up.

The baby, from Kidderminster, represents the fifth generation of females in her family - and it's the second time they have celebrated five generations of girls.

There are 89 years between   Elleah-Jayne and her great-great-grandmother Jean Hore.

Female role models: From left, baby Elleah-Jayne, her mother, Katie Arens, 23, her aunty Amy Conway aged 27, her grandmother,  Laura Wycherley, 45, her great--grandmother Glenda Brown, 66, and great-great-grandmother Jean Hore, 89

In 1987, Elleah-Jayne's aunt Amy Louise became the fifth generation of females when she was born.

She was pictured at the time with her 100-year-old great-great grandmother Sarah Blything.

But when Mrs Blything died in 1991, aged 104, the female contingent in the family was back down to four until Elleah-Jayne was born on July 8 this year to Katie Arens.

And it was Katie's mother, Laura Wycherley, 45, who helped deliver her granddaughter after her 23-year-old daughter suddenly gave birth in the car as she rushed to hospital.

The third generation started with great-grandmother Glenda Hore, 66, and then grandmother Laura.

Laura's daughters Katie and Amy marked the fourth generation while her daughter Elleah-Jayne once more brings the family's female generations back up to five.

New mother Katie, who has another two-year-old son Rylan, said: 'It was a spectacular way for our fifth generation female to arrive into this world.

'I went into labour and my partner Alex was driving me and my mum to hospital when I suddenly had the urge to push.

'We parked the car and dialled 999. We were all surprisingly calm and followed the phone instructions from the emergency services, but after my daughter was born I started to worry.

'However, once the two ambulances arrived, one for me and one for Elleah-Jayne, they were brilliant and both of us are fine.

Plenty of babysitters: The family is full of 'strong women' who all live within five miles of one another

Fast arrival: Elleah-Jayne was born while her mother was still in the car going to the hospital

'She is beautiful but if her arrival is anything to go by we can expect her to be a right little madam.'

There will certainly be plenty of baby-sitters available to help care for the new arrival, with Katie's whole family living within four miles of each other.

Katie added: 'I think it is brilliant that my daughter has four generations of women to care for and support her. When she is older she will have so many stories to hear.

'Our family is very close and Elleah-Jayne will definitely get lots of attention.'

Great-grandmother Glenda Hore, 66, lives in nearby Stourport-on-Severn, Worcs., with husband John, 77.

Glenda also has two children and gave birth to Laura in 1969 when she was 21. Laura lives with husband James, 49, who are both financial advisors.

Laura's youngest daughter Katie, lives with partner Alex Knight-Holmes, 23, a gardener, and her two-year-old son Rylan, who is from a previous relationship.

Great-great grandmother Jean said: 'In 1987, when my mother became a great-great grandmother after the arrival of Katie's older sister Amy Louise, I never imagined that I would one day be in her position but here I am.

'I already have two great-great grandsons but to have five generations of females in the family is amazing and to have it happen to us twice is even more special.

'It's a family of strong women. I valued being in five generations and I'm sure Elleah-Jayne will too.'
