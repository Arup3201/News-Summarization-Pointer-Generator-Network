A World War II combat veteran from upstate New York is returning to the scene of a bloody Pacific island battle this week as an 'army of one.'

90-year-old Don Fida of Syracuse departed Monday morning for the Marshall Islands, where U.S. forces landed on the Japanese-held atoll of Kwajalein on January 31, 1944, according to The Post-Standard of Syracuse.

Fida was a member of the U.S. Army's 7th Division, which helped capture the island after a four-day battle against the Japanese.

The Post-Standard of Syracuse reported that Fida was twenty years old at the time, and also fought in Okinawa and three other battles.

The Japanese captured Fida, wounded his stomach and performed an incomplete castration while he was in the Phillippines, the veteran told the newspaper. Fida claimed that a school acquaintance saved him and tended to him.

He received a Purple Heart and went back to Syracuse  in 1945 and later began a landscaping business, the newspaper reported.

The 33 7th Division vets still alive were invited back to the island for a ceremony marking the battle's 71st anniversary, according to The Post-Standard of Syracuse - which explained that medical treatment available on Kwajalein mandates that traveling veterans must be capable of walking.

'Out of 22,000 men in the 7th Division, I'm the only one that can walk,' Fida told the newspaper.

Going with his daughter Donna Wisniewski, he'll be the only 7th Division veteran attending the ceremony.

'I'm so grateful that I'm able to do this at my age and to be able to remember all of this, which is a miracle to some people,' Fida told The Post-Standard of Syracuse.

Fida told the newspaper he frequently thinks of his memories from Kwajalein - including how he used a fallen comrade and friend's dead body to protect himself from bullets and informed the man's family of what happened in 2003.

Fida will turn 91 on January 28 - with his Kwajalein arrival date being  January 29, the newspaper reported.

Memories: Fida holds a photograph of himself during his WWII service. The 91-year-old will return to celebrate the 71st anniversary of Operation Flintlock, the Battle for Kwajalein Atoll on January 31, 1944
