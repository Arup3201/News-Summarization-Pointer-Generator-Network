An horrific image has emerged of a baby girl moments from being beheaded by IS.

The picture is among several recovered by Kurdish soldiers from the mobile phones of dead fanatics in the Syrian town of Kobane.

It shows the child being pinned to the floor, in clear distress as a knife is held to her throat. 

It is feared she may have been beheaded along with her family for being an Alevi Muslim, a branch of Islam whose followers have been targeted by IS. 

Horror: The harrowing image of the 'beheaded' baby girl was found on the phone of a dead Islamic State militant. Others images showed beheadings and jihadis playing football with the severed heads of victims

Other pictures show beheadings and jihadis playing football with the severed heads of victims. 

They were found by Kurdish YPG fighters defending the besieged town, where more than 1,100 are thought to have been killed since last month. 

The photo of the girl is believed to have been taken a week last Friday. There were no shots of her decapitation and her body has not been found, leading some to hope she had a miraculous escape.

The many fighters who have circulated the picture on Facebook have nicknamed her ‘Melek’, meaning angel.

Blast: The picture is among several recovered by Kurdish soldiers from the mobile phones of dead fanatics in the Syrian town of Kobane, pictured this afternoon during an American airstrike

One source, Ali, who obtained the picture from YPG soldiers, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The people of Kobane are desperate for the world to see with their own eyes the atrocities inflicted by these filth.

Each time I look at this picture it makes me weep.

‘You can see how frightened she is. I can almost hear her scream.What kind of depraved monsters are they? What pleasure can killing this child bring anyone?’

Soldiers said Melek, a woman and an older child – thought to be her mother and sister – were witnessed being dragged out of hiding by IS around the time of an air strike. 

‘Some have a flicker of hope in their hearts that they might have escaped,’ added Ali.
