Luke Anderson won over the nation when he was crowned the winner of Big Brother 2012.

But for the 31-year-old TV star winning the show meant more than just prize money or fame, it meant acceptance, because Luke was actually born a girl.

After living as a man for three years, Luke is now preparing to have a full sex change with the support of his wife Becki Anderson, and the couple plan to start a family as soon as possible with the help of an anonymous sperm donor.

Happy together: Becki and Luke Anderson are looking forward to starting a family together, even though Luke doesn't have a penis because he was born as a girl

22-year-old Becki from Chester had never dated a woman before but loves Luke as a man, despite the fact that he doesn't have a penis, and can't wait to give birth to his child next year.

The couple who married in summer of 2011 told Closer magazine: 'We can’t wait to have a New Year baby. We’ll pick a sperm donor who has features like Luke so the baby looks like both of us.'

They plan on bringing up their baby to be open-minded and will one day explain the situation.

Over the last three years, Luke's hormone injections have lowered his voice, grown hair on his body and even thickened his facial bones, which help him achieve a more masculine look.

After dating men and 
attempting to live his life as a woman, at the age of 27 he decided to begin the process of changing sex.

Becki, who is now a mortgage advisor, worked as a waitress in a hotel at the age of 20 and met chef Luke there.

The pair hadn't gone further than kissing when Luke divulged his secret.

Becki was shocked when she found out the truth but was so impressed that he mustered the courage to tell her

'It might sound hard to believe, but I don’t care he hasn’t got a penis.

'We have an amazing sex life. We try all different toys and positions, though Luke doesn’t wear a strap-on,' she told Closer.

After moving in together, the pair married at the hotel they met at and Luke underwent a double mastectomy.

But it wasn't until May 2012 that they shared Luke's secret with Becki's family.

Because of Luke entering the Big Brother house, they knew it was the right time and Becki's family, friends and colleagues all fully supported them.

After putting his £50,000 Big Brother winnings towards saving for a family home, Luke said: 'It’ll give us the family we dream of.

'I think I’ll make a great dad and I know Becki will be a brilliant mum.'
