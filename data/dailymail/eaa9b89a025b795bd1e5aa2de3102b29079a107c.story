Disciplined: Victoria Wasteney, an occupational therapist, was found guilty of three counts of misconduct after she prayed with her Muslim colleague

A Christian NHS worker has been disciplined for 'bullying' a Muslim colleague by praying with her.

Victoria Wasteney, an occupational therapist, was also condemned for inviting the woman to a sports day at her church.

And a hearing found her guilty of a further count of misconduct: lending the colleague a book about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity.

The 37-year-old, who was suspended for nine months, has now been banned from discussing her faith at work and given a formal warning by East London NHS Foundation Trust that will remain on her record for a year.

Challenging the measures, Miss Wasteney, from Essex, has blasted the NHS for being intolerant.

'I believe in tolerance for everyone,' she told the Telegraph.

'It certainly wasn't an attempt to convert her to Christianity,' she added.

Miss Wasteney claims she invited the colleague to a number of church events after she showed an interest in the work they do against human trafficking.

When the woman went on sick leave, she recommended a book about a Muslim converting that they had discussed at work.

And when the colleague came into her office in tears over health problems, Miss Wasteney claims she told her to draw on her faith, before they prayed together.

However, in June 2013, Miss Wasteney was told she had received a formal bullying complaint and would have to be suspended while the accusations were investigated.

'Intolerant': Miss Wasteney has blasted East London NHS Foundation Trust for being intolerant as she launches legal action against the disciplinary measures, which has banned her from discussing her faith

In February, a hearing upheld three charges of misconduct.

She is now challenging the ruling with the support of the Christian Legal Centre.

Contacted for a statement, a spokesman for East London NHS Foundation Trust refused to comment on individual cases.Â
