Six weeks after a teen mother vanished without trace, her brother has been arrested over unspecified abuse claims.

Derek Wood, 21, was charged with abuse on Friday, according to the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office.

His 19-year-old sister Brittney has not been seen since May 30, when she disappeared during a trip to visit her uncle about 45 miles from her home in Theodore, Alabama.

It is not yet known whether the two events have any connection.

The uncle, Donald Holland, was found dead of an apparent suicide the next day - before he could be questioned by investigators.

The case of Brittney Wood, who has a two-year-old daughter, has baffled investigators who have not yet found any trace of the teen.

The sheriff’s office would not comment when asked whether Derek Wood's arrest is linked to his sister’s disappearance.

Brittney’ mother, Chessie Wood, told WKRG that Derek and Brittney were extremely close.

She told the network: 'They have the same friends, run the same places, I mean they're like this. He is Brittney's protector and he feels like he wasn't there when he should've been.'

In a statement posted on The Hometown Search for Brittney Wood Facebook page her father and stepmother, Wallace & Stephanie Hanke said: 'In the wake of the recent arrest our focus is still the same as it's been from the beginning (sic).

'Our goal is to bring Brittney home. Thanks for the continued support of family & friends.'

Derek Wood, who is listed on the office’s website as homeless, is being held on $25,000 bond.

Also in the weeks since Ms Wood vanished, two more of her uncles were arrested, but the arrests are not believed to be connected to the teen's case.

Both of the uncles, Dustin Kent, 32, and Randall Wood, 42, have since been released on bond.

Brittney Wood is described as 5'1" and 105 pounds, with dirty blonde hair and blue eyes.
