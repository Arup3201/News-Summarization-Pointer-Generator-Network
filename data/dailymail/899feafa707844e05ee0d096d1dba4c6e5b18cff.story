Sunderland defender Wes Brown has become the latest star to appear on ITV show 'Who's Doing The Dishes', showing off his culinary skills with a three-course meal for his guests.

The 34-year-old welcomed four diners for a famous feast around his glamorous home, which includes the likes of a swimming pool, cinema room and a vast collection of illustrious medals from his playing career.

After having a quick kick-about with host Brian McFadden, Brown got down to business in the kitchen preparing a wholesome feast for his guests, including his special dish Jamaican jerk chicken with rice and peas.

As well as that he prepared two types of bruschetta for starter, and gingerbread men for dessert - drawing a comparison between his appearance and the latter during the show.

Prior to this show the team had correctly guessed their last two celebrity hosts who had cooked for them this week. 

Brown has been an ever-present so far this season for Sunderland, making five appearances in all competitions for Gus Poyet's side.
