Accused: Prosecutors say Sean Frayne (pictured on January 26) 'forcefully' raped a woman

A chief fire officer broke down in court yesterday after telling a jury he had sex with a woman in a village pub, while his unwitting wife sat drinking yards away.

Sean Frayne is accused of raping the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in an empty part of the building in Etwall, Derby in December 2006.

But the 48-year-old father-of-three claims the encounter was consensual and began when his accuser 'came on to him' with a 'passionate' kiss.

Mr Frayne was giving evidence in his own defence. He claims the woman turned to him after they had sex and said:  'We shouldn't have done that with your wife nearby.'

He wept as he told jurors he was a 'fool' for having a 'one night stand' with her but added: 'I'm not a rapist.'

Prosecutors say Frayne, the chief officer of Derbyshire's Fire and Rescue Service, followed the woman to an unused section of the pub and made polite conversation before 'forcefully' raping her.

They claim he then returned to his wife Helen Frayne in the bar area 'as though nothing had happened'.

The woman kept quiet about the alleged attack for seven years, Derby Crown Court has heard.

She eventually broke down and confided in a friend during a family wedding in 2013 and Frayne was arrested in February last year.

But he says his version of events was 'the truth' and the allegation had 'wrecked his life'.

The court heard he is currently suspended from his £142,000 a year job and his wife of 20 years had been 'destroyed' when he was forced to tell her about having sex with another woman. 

Frayne claimed the liaison began when he and his alleged victim found themselves alone - and she kissed him.

He said he 'unfortunately' kissed her back and told jurors: 'It was a nice, warm, welcoming passionate kiss. It wasn't a peck on the cheek.'

He added the woman then touched him intimately before they ended up having sex for a 'couple of minutes'.

Frayne said: 'It stopped and she looked round and said, "We shouldn't have done that with your wife nearby".

'I'm a fool. I'd never experienced anything like that in my life. I zipped myself up and left I went to the toilet, washed my hands, and went back in the bar.

'She [his accuser] was sat back in there next to my wife.'

Frayne added the couple stayed for a 'few more drinks' before leaving the pub.

He told the court he has seen his accuser in the years since the alleged attack and everything had appeared 'normal'.

He next heard about the allegation when he received a letter accusing him of rape. It had been sent by a friend of the woman and suggested the matter could be settled 'with an out of court payment'.

Frayne and his wife went to confront his accuser who claimed to know nothing about the letter at her home. She made a formal complaint to police in December 2013.

Frayne, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, denies rape. The trial continues.
