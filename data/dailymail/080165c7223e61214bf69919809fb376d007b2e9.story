Vile: George-Josef Blaj broke into a young woman's house before beating and raping her

A convicted Romanian rapist brutally attacked a young woman in her own home within weeks of  arriving in Britain.

George-Josif
 Blaj, 20, fled to the UK after judges released him three years into a 
prison sentence for a horrific rape and three robberies in his home 
country.

Less than three 
months after arriving in Britain, he broke into the woman’s home in the 
early hours and throttled her until she was unconscious.

When
 she awoke, she begged him to take her money but he refused, flashing a 
knife at her, battering her with a spade and subjecting her to a violent
 rape.

Jailing him for 15 years yesterday, a judge branded Blaj a rapist ‘of the most extreme nature’.

The
 girl’s friends, meanwhile, said she stopped feeling safe in the UK and 
had emigrated for fear of further attacks.

And MPs demanded to know why a
 criminal with such an ‘appalling’ history of violence was ever allowed 
into the country.

Blaj, a 
drink and drug abuser, was jailed as a minor in Romania in 2009 after he
 raped a woman in his home town Zarnesti, 125 miles north of Bucharest, 
when he was 16.

Because he 
was so young, he was sentenced to serve just four-and-a-half years for 
the sexual assault and three robberies and was granted a conditional 
release after serving two thirds of his sentence.

Border controls have effectively been eroded by free movement directives issued by Brussels, which mean Britain must open its doors to people from other EU countries, even convicted criminals.

Anyone coming to the UK from outside the EU faces stringent tests and must apply for a visa, giving details of their criminal history.

When it comes to most of those arriving from inside the EU, however, the Border Agency has no way of knowing their criminal record.

They are checked against a range of watch-lists – which include suspected terrorists, those wanted by police, certain sex offenders, and people excluded from the UK.

But British police rely on other countries to provide them with the details. The system breaks down when the offender’s home country does not come forward with this information.

Cynically, foreign countries within the EU may even withhold information because they would rather their murderers were in the UK than at home. If they are not informed, British police have no way of checking a foreigner’s criminal convictions.

But
 none of the conditions barred Blaj from travelling abroad and within 
weeks he moved to Britain, where his conviction was not flagged up.

Less
 than three months later, on February 1 this year, he broke into a house
 in Northampton by climbing through a bathroom window.

The
 victim, 24, awoke at around 7am to find him standing over her bed 
clutching a shovel. She saw a knife by the bed before he reached down 
and throttled her.

She lost 
consciousness and he waited for her to come back around, when she begged
 him to take her money and her laptop and leave.

Instead, he raped her and when she tried to scream, he attacked her with the spade, leaving her face and hair soaked in blood.

He
 was eventually caught after the girl’s best friend and housemate heard a
 commotion and walked in to see Blaj holding the spade.

‘I
 thought [my friend] was out for the night. I opened the door and saw 
the guy. Everything was in a big mess and he was holding a shovel,’ she 
said.

‘I couldn’t see [my friend] so I thought he was robbing the house.

‘I
 ran back to my room and locked it and he started banging on the door to
 make me afraid. I called the police and thought he would leave but he 
went back to [my friend’s] room.’

Blaj fled after officers arrived but was found nearby.

Jailed: Blaj was sentenced to 15 years in prison at Northampton Crown Court and will be deported afterwards

The Latvian victim’s friend only realised she had been attacked when she suddenly emerged from her room dazed and bloodied.

She was naked but had covered herself with a bed sheet.

The
 friend said: ‘After she came home from the police and the hospital, she
 packed her things. Within a fortnight she left for Canada. She was so 
scared … Everywhere that she turned there were reminders of what had 
happened.’

Criticism: MP Michael Ellis hit out at Romanian authorities claiming they did not inform the UK that Blaj had a serious conviction

Blaj was 
arrested and pleaded guilty to assault, burglary and rape despite 
claiming to have no memory of the attack, saying he had taken drugs and 
alcohol beforehand.

He also admitted burgling a mosque in Northampton.

On
 August 22 at Northampton Crown Court, he was given a sentence of 15 
years , with 11 years to be served in custody and four years on licence.

He will be deported after 
he serves his sentence. Judge Rupert Mayo said Blaj was a rapist ‘of the
 most extreme nature’. ‘This has left the victim with permanent 
psychological scarring,’ he said.

Addressing
 Blaj, he added: ‘What makes this case more disturbing is your young age
 and your previous convictions for rape and burglary in Romania.’

Michael
 Ellis, MP for Northampton North, said: ‘This is another appalling 
example of a person who has been permitted to enter the UK despite the 
fact that his presence was against the public’s interest.

‘The
 question needs to be asked why the Romanian authorities did not inform 
the UK that this person should not be permitted entry.’

The
 Home Office said people travelling to the UK were checked against a 
range of watch-lists but the onus for flagging someone’s criminal  
history is with the authorities in their home country.

‘Where
 we receive information that foreign nationals present a genuine threat 
to society, we are able to take action to prevent their entry to the 
UK,’ a spokesman added.
