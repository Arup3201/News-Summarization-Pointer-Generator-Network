The daughter of a Sandy Hook hero has married – but her deceased mother was still able to play a prominent part in the wedding.

Erica Lafferty, one of Sandy Hook principle Dawn Hochsprung daughters, married July 6 to her fiancee who had supported her through the grief of her mother's death.

Lafferty, 27, made a morning stop at her mother’s grave- wedding dress and all- to make sure the heroic woman had her place on the special day

‘I wanted to let her know how much I missed her," Lafferty told People Magazine.

‘No daughter should ever have to do that on her wedding day.’

Lafferty posted a picture of the tender moment to her personal Twitter page, with the poignant caption: 'I love you, Mommy'.

Planning the wedding was one of the last things the two women did before the horrific December 2012 shooting that claimed Hochsprung’s life, along with dozens of others.

Hochsprung is credited with saving the 
lives  countless children and teachers by confronting the gunman and 
broadcasting their interaction over the school announcement system so 
that everyone in the building could hear it and use the time to hide.

‘Never in a million years did I think I would be getting married without my mother there. Planning for my wedding was actually one of the last things my mom and I did together before she was killed,’ Lafferty told the magazine.

Lafferty and longtime boyfriend Christopher Smegielski were married at her Hochsprung’s upstate New York lake house in the Adirondacks, according to the magazine.

As a tribute to her mother, Lafferty wore custom sneakers as part of her bridal ensemble.

‘My mom always teased me because I was such a tomboy," she told People.

‘When I was picking out my dress, we found you could custom Converse sneakers, so she knew I had ordered them.’

The recently married Lafferty also shared that she finds a way to keep her mother part of every single day. Just days before the wedding, she posted a picture of a sign she left at her mother’s grave.

Smegielski stood by Lafferty during a number of interviews immediately following the December 14 tragedy.

In a segment for The Today Show, he said: 'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter'.

'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible,' he said.

Lafferty added that she was finding it 'tough' after her mother's death.

'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on.

'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.'

Lafferty is now a gun control advocate, working with Mayors Against Illegal Guns ‘to fight common-sense gun laws and join with others who've lost loved ones.’
