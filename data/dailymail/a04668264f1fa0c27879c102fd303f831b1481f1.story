He may be third in line to the throne,
but the newest addition to the Royal family was carried away from St Mary's Hospital seated in something a little more practical and safe.

Well wishers outside St Mary's 
Hospital watched as Prince William carried the Royal baby in his car seat from the steps of the Lindo Wing earlier today.

But a far cry from the throne he will one day occupy, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's newborn son will have to make do with an £80 car seat for now.

Prince William was seen carrying his son in a simple Britax 
Baby-Safe Infant Carrier car seat and although he appeared to fix it effortless into the car - he had a helping hand.

The Prince avoided every new father's worst nightmare - grappling with seatbelts trying to fasten the seat into the car - as he simply clipped it into a pre-belted base.

While the seat is a snip, retailing from as little as £80 online, the base itself sells for as much again.

The car seat won the Mother & Baby 
award for Best Buy in the infant car seat category in 2012, and is a 
favourite among new parents.

Crowds gathered outside the hospital were given a sneak peak of the child's first throne when an aide was seen carrying it into the maternity wing earlier today.

A Britax spokesman told MailOnline: 'The car seat is very safe, award-winning, and a great choice for newborns.'

According to Britax: 'The lightweight Baby-Safe provides a secure travel solution for your baby from birth.

'They
are secured by the 5-point safety harness and the deep, softly-padded 
side wings and head support add to your baby’s safety and comfort.

'The integral cushion allows your baby to lie in a more natural, comfortable position.'

Incidentally, Britax also have a model 
called the King Plus, for babies over nine months old. We'll have to 
wait until 2014 to see him in that one.

European Managing Director, Ian 
Watson, said that his firm were 'delighted' that one of their seats will
carry the heir to the throne from the hospital.

He said: 'As a British brand and the 
leader in child travel safety, are delighted and honoured to hear that 
the Prince of Cambridge could be making his first journey in one of our 
infant carriers.

'We send our warmest wishes of health
and happiness to TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they begin 
their exciting journey in to parenthood.'

The car seat could be used to transport the new baby for at least a year.

Britax says it is safe to use their seat until the baby weighs 13 kgs, the normal weight for a 12 to 15 month old.

Safe at a snip of a price: The Britax baby-Safe infant Carrier, which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge carried their newborn son home in, retails online from just £80

Cheat: But the couple also used a pre-belted base for the seat which saved the new parents from grappling with seatbelts in an attempt to strap their son in
