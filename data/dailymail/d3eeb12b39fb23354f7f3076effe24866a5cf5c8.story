Prime Minister Tony Abbott today stood by a plan that doctors fear will end bulk billing and force them to slug patients with higher prices from next week.

Doctors are on the warpath over the plan to cut the Medicare rebate for short doctor consultations (between 6 and 9 minutes) by $20.10 from Monday.

Some clinics have already announced they will cut bulk billing plans for groups of people and other doctors are considering whether they will pass the cost on to patients. 

But the policy seems likely to be overturned in February as Labor has joined a majority of senators in pledging to vote down the plan when Parliament sits.

Letter: Doctors are already providing patients with letters such as this in opposition to the Abbott Government's plan to cut the Medicare rebate for short consultations (between 6 and 9 minutes)

Rebate cut: The government argues that the Medicare rebate cut will encourage longer consultations and an end to 'six minute medicine'

Many GPs are writing letters to patients, penning Facebook posts and plastering their surgeries with protest posters over the plan. 

Labor, the Greens and three key crossbench senators - Nick Xenophon, Jacqui Lambie and Ricky Muir - have indicated they will vote to disallow. That means a majority of senators currently oppose the policy.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten described the policy as the 'D-Day for GPs in Australia' and pledged to stop the 'sneaky' measure. 

'Our position is unequivocal, it's in black and white. We will oppose Tony Abbott, absolutely, changing the rebate system for GPs,' he said.

On Radio 3AW this morning, Mr Abbott said: 'I say to all of the critics: If you don't like what we are doing, come up with your alternative because we simply cannot go on as a government, and as a country, living beyond our means.'

Mr Abbott said it was essential for the government to get healthcare costs under control in order to save the Medicare system. 

Dr Stephen Parnis, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said the plan had caused a 'level of angst and indeed fury among general practitioners'. 

Northwest Health, a chain of surgeries in Tamworth, New South Wales, has announced it will no longer be able to 'routinely offer bulk billing to concession card holders and children under 16'

There will also be a $5 cut to Medicare rebates for non-concessional patients from July

'They have many patients for whom the reduction of over $20... will impose incredible hardship on them,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Doctors are being forced to choose between an unviable business and patients who will be unable to see them on the basis of costs.

Rural Doctors Association of Australia CEO Jenny Johsnon said she had 'no doubt' doctors were already making changes. 

'We get feedback from a lot of doctors who are looking at their cost structures,' she said. 'The issue is the general practices are also small businesses.' 

A NSW AMA branch spokesman Lachlan Jones said many doctors were still considering whether the introduce changes, as the plan was introduced just prior to the holiday period. 

Northwest Health, a chain of medical centres in Tamworth, New South Wales, announced cuts to their bulk billing practices this week. 

'Due to the changes to Medicare rebates that commence on 19 January our practice will no longer be able to routinely offer bulk billing to concession card holders and children under 16,' they wrote on their Facebook page. 

Campaigners against Medicare cuts have also shared an image of a letter given to patients at a medical practice. 

The letter said: 'This practice is not able to absorb the cut made by the government and will have to pass it on to you, the patient'.

A spokesman for Health Minister Sussan Ley said she would explain the benefits of the plan with senators. 

'The majority of GP consultations in Australia already last over 10 minutes and will therefore be unaffected. Bulk billing will also remain free for patients.'

He said the changes encourage longer consultations with patients and not 'six minute medicine'.  

The government tabled the change as a regulation before Christmas. Parliament can review the regulation on February 9.
