Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted's chief inspector for schools, has warned rowdy behaviour in class is dragging schools down

Rowdy behaviour in class and a contempt for learning are dragging English pupils behind their peers in Asian countries, the chief inspector of schools will warn today.

The education of 700,000 children – one in ten overall – is suffering because teachers are failing to crack down on ‘horseplay’, Sir Michael Wilshaw will say.

In a speech to mark the launch of Ofsted’s annual report, he plans to describe how schools are plagued by a ‘casual acceptance of low-level disruption and poor attitudes to learning’ that is ‘a million miles away from the sort of cultures we see in some of the high-performing Asian countries’.

The comments come a week after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed that 15-year-old Asian children are easily outperforming other students from around the world.

British pupils came outside the top 20 in maths, science and reading for the first time – and are now lagging an average of around three years behind their counterparts in the Far East.

The results painted a troubling picture of the UK’s ability to compete with countries where teachers are revered and iron-willed pupils study for 12 hours or more every day.

Ofsted plans to focus on behaviour during the coming year, and headteachers will be expected to take back control of classrooms, Sir Michael will announce.

Only by creating ‘the calm and respectful culture essential for learning’ can classes avoid being hijacked by ‘background chatter, inattention and horseplay’.

He will go on to say: ‘Unless this changes, teachers will struggle to create an environment in which all children learn well.’

The former headteacher criticised teachers last month for failing to show pupils that adults are in charge.

He said there was ‘nothing wrong’ with telling children: ‘Do as I ask because I am the adult.’

He also attacked a generation of headteachers who are too weak-willed to lead by example, explaining: ‘Children cannot thrive in a chaotic school where there is little authority.’

School staff were handed new powers in 2011 to tackle disruptive pupils. Teachers were given more leeway to use force, the right to search children for items such as mobile phones – and financial penalties were increased for parents who allow their children to truant.

How Britain's schools are lagging behind some of the best performing Asian schools

Other powers teachers have been given include issuing no-notice detentions. And a school’s decision to exclude a pupil can no longer be reversed by an appeals panel.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said the measures would give disruptive pupils an ‘unambiguous lesson in who’s boss’.

A quarter of free schools have opened in areas where there is no demand for extra places, according to an official report.

The National Audit Office said 42 of the 174 schools set up over the past three years are in districts with ‘no forecast need’.

It
 means £241million out of the £950million in set-up costs has so far 
been spent in areas where there are already surplus places.

But Sir Michael’s speech will suggest that he believes teachers still lack the confidence to exert their authority after years of seeing their powers eroded.

He will also insist today that  poverty is no longer an excuse for academic failure, and will describe the nation’s ‘education lottery’ which sees the country divided into ‘lucky and unlucky children’.

He believes that some of the ‘unluckiest children’ are those  living in relatively affluent areas in the Home Counties, which are let down by coasting schools.

The annual report is expected to outline a blueprint for a ‘national service’ of top teachers and headteachers who are ready to be deployed to failing areas to help turn them around.

The East of England and the North East in particular will be  criticised. But Sir Michael will claim the ‘battle against mediocrity’ in English education is being won, with eight out of ten schools now judged good or outstanding – the highest proportion in Ofsted’s 21-year history.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Sir Michael is right – bad classroom behaviour is hugely disruptive to children’s  education. It means teachers can’t teach and pupils can’t learn.

‘That is why a key part of our reforms is restoring discipline in schools and why we have strengthened teachers’ powers to put them back in charge.’
