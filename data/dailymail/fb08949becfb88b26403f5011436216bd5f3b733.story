Scientists studying data from the the Large Hadron Collider who this summer announced the possible discovery of the Higgs boson now say they may have found two previously uknown particles.

The most recent release from the Atlas experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern) shows that their data contains two clear peaks indicating new particles.

It seems they have found one Higgs boson with one mass, and then another with a statistically significant slightly higher mass.

First proposed in 1964 the Higgs boson is the last missing piece of the Standard Model, a widely accepted theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe.

According to that model of our world, the Higgs particle must exist to bestow mass on other fundamental particles. However, until it was possible to build high-powered colliders like the LHC it has been impossible to detect.

Researchers at Cern in July announced that they believed their experiments had finally revealed the Higgs. But asÂ Scientific American explains, their findings were far from definite.

The Higgs they found appeared to show that the Higgs seemed to be decaying into two photons more often than they had expected - hinting at a new, as yet unimagined physics.

Last week scientists with the project's Atlas experiment finally admitted that the bizarre revelations from their data - that there appears to be not one Higg's boson signal, but two..

There seems to be one version of Higgs boson with a mass of 123.5 gigaelectron volts (the unit particle physicists prefer using to measure mass) and a second Higgs with a mass of 126.6 GeV.

The Higgs boson was proposed in 1964 - it is the last missing piece of the Standard Model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe.

The other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the Higgs is the last jigsaw piece.

If the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the Standard Model and going back to the drawing board.

And if there are in fact more than one Higgs boson particles, as the latest results seem to show, it could lead to a new understanding of dark matter, the mysterious substance thought to make up a large portion of the mass of the universe.

Scientific American reports how the Atlas team have spent the past month trying to find out whether they had made a mistake in their analysis. They have so far found none, raising the possibility that there may indeed be two Higgs bosons.

The anomalous result could of course still have been caused be a statistical blip that is not repeated as further data is collected, but their are certain versions of the Standard Model that predict the existence of multiple Higgs particles.

However these theories do not predict why one kind would decay into two Z particles, while the other decays into photons.

Furthermore the similarity in mass of the two particles is something that even the variants of the Standard Model are not able to explain.

For the moment, the scientists at Cern are not too concerned. Tommaso Dorigo, an experimental particle physicist on the projects CMS experiment says it is likely to turn out to be a blip.

He blogs: 'This is normal business - if we had to get excited at every slight disagreement between our measurements and our expectations, we'd be sick with Priapism (sorry ladies for this gender-specific pun).'

One has slightly more mass than the other, and each decays into different kinds of particles

Findings could challenge the Standard Model of physics, but researchers say they may merely be a statistical blip
