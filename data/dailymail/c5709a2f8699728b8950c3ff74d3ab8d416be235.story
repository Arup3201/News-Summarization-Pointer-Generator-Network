The founder of athletic label Lululemon pointed the finger at 'some women's bodies' as part of the reason why a line of yoga pants were recalled earlier this year for being too sheer.

Founder Chip Wilson told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday: 'Frankly, some women’s bodies just don’t actually work.'

Mr Wilson, along with his co-founder and wife Shannon Wilson, made the remarks as their company released its Full-On Luon pants, a style which claims to have 'major support and coverage'.

When speaking about how some customers' complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Mr Wilson  continued: 'It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time and how they much they use it.'

The founder's remarks caused Bloomberg TV host Trish Regan to cut in and ask: 'Interesting, not every woman can wear a Lululemon yoga pant?'

Mr Wilson responded: 'No, I think they can. I just think it’s how you use it.'

In March, the Canadian company was forced to recall 17 per cent of its yoga pants due to an 
unacceptable 'level of sheerness' created during the manufacturing 
process.

At the time, the 
company said that it was not sure why the pants were so sheer since they
 hadn't changed the materials used or switched manufacturers.

The
 scandal damaged its reputation and reportedly cost the company over 
$20million, and in June CEO Christine Day announced that she would be 
stepping down after five-and-a-half years.

Fine details: The leggings, which range in price from $72 to $98 per pair, 'involved a lot of people to develop,' says lead yoga designer Antonia as the camera pans to a close-up of yarn and machinery

In a very stylized video for new yoga 
pants, lead yoga designer Antonia delicately touches on the subject, 
saying: 'We saw that there was an opportunity to take the fabric and 
evolve it to another place.'

Full-On Luon leggings, which range in price from $72 to $98 per pair, 'involved a lot of people to develop,' she says, adding: 'It 
took over two-and-a-half years'

The camera shows a close-up of yarn and machinery as dramatic music plays in the background.

'In developing it we had to look at 
everything from where the yarn was coming from, how it was being 
knitted, the construction, the mills that we work with,' she explains.

Shots of women practicing various yoga poses in the pants show that they do indeed seem to maintain their opacity.

Painstaking process: Joan, vp of global product quality, explains in the ad: 'In the testing of the product there's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on. Every single lot of the fabric is tested before it leaves the mill'

Joan, VP of global product quality, explains in the ad: 'In the testing of the product 
there's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on. Every single lot of the 
fabric is tested before it leaves the mill.'

And materials innovation director Yogendra elaborates about the seemingly painstaking process of constructing the fabric, saying: 'We use special very fine microfiber yarns with a very special yarn construction'

Later he adds: 'We made this fabric 55 different ways to
 come to our current formulation that would give us one of the best 
fabrics in the industry.'

While the video claims that these new 
pants are made from a more supportive and opaque fabric, many of the reviews on the 
Lululemon website would suggest otherwise.

Still dissatisfied: One customer wrote: 'They pill and the thread in the seams loosens. I want to love these pants so bad. . . but honestly, my $15 Walmart pants are WAY better quality'

One dissatisfied customer wrote: 'They pill and the thread in the seams loosens. I want to love these pants so bad. . . but honestly, my $15 Walmart pants are WAY 
better quality.'

Another complained that the pants are just as see-through as their predecessors. 'After wearing four times I'm already experiencing pilling and sheerness,' she wrote.

'I am upset because spending so much money on leggings I expected them to be much better quality.'

A spokesperson told Reuters that only a very small number of customers has complained and that 'guest feedback is not indicative of a larger issue'.
