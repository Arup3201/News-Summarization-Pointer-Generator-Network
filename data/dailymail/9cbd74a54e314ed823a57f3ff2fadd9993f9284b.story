A Maine man who was terrifyingly dragged from his tent and attacked by a polar bear while camping in Canada has serious injuries but is improving in a Montreal hospital, according to his wife.

Matthew Dyer was attacked by a bear that crossed an electric fence designed to protect members of his group in Torngat Mountains National Park at the northern tip of Labrador on Wednesday.

The mauling ended when members of his group drove the bear away by firing flares. Dyer has a broken jaw and neck injuries.

The group had been advised to hire an armed guard to protect against such attacks but decided against it, a Parks Canada spokesman said.

Officials said they were investigating whether the portable electrified fence was working properly.

A helicopter took Dyer to a trauma center before he was transferred to Montreal General Hospital, his wife said.

'My husband has received incredible care in Canada and at the Montreal General Hospital; I believe that's why he is still alive,' Jeanne Wells said in a statement.

Wells told the Sun Journal newspaper of Lewiston that Dyer, of Turner, has retained his sense of humor even though he remains immobilized and cannot speak.

Dyer's neck remains immobilized to keep the fractures stable, and a breathing tube is in place to ensure that swelling doesn't interfere with breathing, she said.

Dyer, a lawyer with Pine Tree Legal Services, was attacked on Wednesday.

As of Sunday, he remained in critical but stable condition. The hospital had no further updates Monday.

Dyer was part of a seven-man group on a guided tour of Torngat National Park on the northern tip of Newfoundland when the attack happened.

The area is well known for polar bears and visitors sleeping in the park are equipped with an electric fence which is supposed to shock the animals if they touch it.

Dyer’s group was sleeping behind 
their protective fence when the single polar bear attacked them at about
1:30am on Wednesday morning.

The bear dragged Dyer from his tent and was mauling him when his friends fired flares to scare the bear which dropped him and ran off.

It then took several hours for the group to could contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

A
helicopter stationed at Saglek Fjord, about an hour flight away, was 
sent to the area and then took Dyer to a trauma clinic in Quebec. He was later transferred to Montreal 
General Hospital.

Wells was informed of the attack on Wednesday afternoon and flew to Montreal.

‘The Canadians did an amazing job of getting him transported. There was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start,' she told the Bangor Daily News over the weekend.

'He is in very stable condition. He will make a full recovery and that is a testament to his strength.'

Authorities are investigating how the attack happened and if there was an issue with the group's protective fence.

A spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005.

'There are high densities of bears in the park and you are at very high risk of encountering a bear. That said, this is the only incident we have had of this seriousness since the park was established,' said Peter Deering, manager of resource conservation for Parks Canada in Western Newfoundland and Labrador.

Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park located on the Northern Labrador Mountains in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers.
