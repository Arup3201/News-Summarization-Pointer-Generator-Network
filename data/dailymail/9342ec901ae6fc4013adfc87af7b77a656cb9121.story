Britain's quadruple gold-winning medallists David Weir and Sarah Storey were roared on by the crowd as they carried the Union flag into the Olympic Stadium during the Closing Ceremony.

They were joined by flagbearers from the other 163 competing nations as they paraded into the centre of the arena where they formed a heart shape encircled in a ring of fire.

The procession also was surrounded by some stunning effects and more than 1,000 performers, including a cast of disabled artists, who had spent weeks learning circus skills for the show.

Spirit of the Games: All 164 nations filed in together before forming the centrepiece of the celebrations in the middle of the stadium

The ceremony's theme - the Festival of
 the Flame - was introduced by soldier Rory Mackenzie, whose leg was 
blown off by a roadside bomb in Iraq.

Praising the 'indomitable human spirit' of the Paralympians, he told the crowd: 'Tonight we bring you the
 Festival of the Flame, the symbol of the spirit of the Games, which has
 burned bright at London 2012.

'Tonight we celebrate that spirit and 
although we have many differences, there is one quality we all share, 
one thing all of us have in common: human spirit.

'We have all been touched by the 
triumphs and drama of the Paralympics, witness to the indomitable human 
spirit of the athletes. We have come together in peace for the Games and
 through that respect for each other, found hope for the future.'

The achievements of wheelchair racer 
Weir and cyclist Storey, who each won four golds could not be separated 
so team officials asked the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) for
 permission to change protocol of having a single carrier.

Weir has lit up the Olympic Stadium 
over the last 10 days, with victories over 5000m, 1500m and 800m, and he
 won Britain’s last gold of the Games in the T54 Marathon.

At the end of his fourth Games, the 33-year-old Londoner now has a career haul of six gold, two silver and two bronze medal.

Before the ceremony, Weir said it was a 'great honour' to carry the flag into the stadium.

'I’m a proud Brit and Sarah is as 
well. She has done fantastically well too. To do it as a Londoner in 
front of a London crowd makes it even more special,' he said.

Storey starred in the Velodrome and on
 the road, taking individual pursuit and 500m time trial victories on 
the track before moving to Brands Hatch, where she won the Time Trial 
and triumphed in emphatic fashion in the C5 Road Race on Thursday.

That win brought her 11th career gold,
 making Mancunian Storey - a former swimmer who switched to cycling in 
2005 - Britain’s most decorated female Paralympian.

With eight silver medals and three 
bronze in a 20-year career she surpassed former wheelchair racer 
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson’s collection of 11 golds, four silvers and 
one bronze.

'I’m amazed at the news, I never expected it,' said Storey, 34, ahead of the ceremony.

'I’ve not been to a Paralympic 
ceremony since Athens and can’t wait to see the stadium tonight. It’s a 
huge honour and it should be a very exciting night.'
