A mysterious, sinister-looking clown who haunts the streets of Northampton and waves at passers-by has been filmed emerging from a lake.

The unnerving character is shown standing knee-deep in water, and waves at the camera while otherwise staying completely still.

He is then filmed climbing out of the lake, in Northampton's Abington park.

It appears to be the first time to clown, who has so far remained anonymous, has specifically arranged to be photographed.

Beforehand he was only snapped by chance when people on the streets in Northampton saw him.

He has recently taken to playing games with those who follow his Facebook page, leaving clues about his next appearance.

Earlier this week he dropped hints before appearing to dedicated fans on Northmpaton's Elm Street - a reference to the Nightmare on Elm Street horror films.

The timing of the images coincided with the arrival on stage of pop group Madness, who were playing just a few hundred yards away from the park at Northamptonshire County Cricket Ground.

He posted a link on his Facebook group detailing his exploits with the caption: 'So you are all at a gig...but just down the road i emerged....They all float!!! Beep Beep!'

While some followers have labelled the clown 'creepy', others consider him a local legend.

Jason Wilde wrote on Facebook: 'Keep up the fine work. You are an awesome distraction in this too serious world.'

Other fans from further afield also posted messages of support with Holly Payne adding: 'Sending so much love from Hollywood! You have a HUGE fan base here! Beep Beep!'

Last week he broke his silence and in his first interview claimed he was not trying to scare anyone.

The clown - who wishes to remain anonymous - said: 'I just wanted to amuse people. Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards.

'It's like watching a horror movie, when people get scared they usually start laughing - naturally, some people would have been extremely frightened by what they saw. But I hope many are starting to see it as a bit of harmless fun.'
