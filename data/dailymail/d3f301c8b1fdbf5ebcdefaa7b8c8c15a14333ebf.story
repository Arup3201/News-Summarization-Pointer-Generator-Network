Students at a Chinese high school gave new meaning to the practice of 'hot desking' during a heat wave this week... and sat their exams in a forest.

Teachers at the school, in Jinzhou city in Hubei province, were worried their pupils might overheat during their end-of-term tests so they moved all tables and chairs outside.

And not only did it allow the students to take their exams with a cool breeze on their backs but also made it harder to cheat, headmaster Luk Chien claimed.

Hot desking: Teachers at the school, in Jinzhou city in Hubei province, were worried their pupils might overheat during their end-of-term tests so they moved all tables and chairs outside

Leaf it out: And not only did it allow the students 
to take their exams with a cool breeze on their backs but it also made it 
harder to cheat, headmaster Luk Chien claimed

The 56-year-old declared: 'Nature has
 blessed us with beautiful weather - I suggest we show our appreciation 
for it by going outside to enjoy the sunshine which will have a 
nourishing effect on both bodies and minds!'

Headmaster Chien went on: 'The outdoor aspect to exams is also good to prevent cheating. 

'It is easier in an enclosed and crowded space for students who are tempted to be untruthful to copy or crib the answers from their friends. 

'Outside we were able to space the desks much more widely apart and had a better overview.

Nourishing: The school head told pupils nature had 'blessed us with beautiful weather' and suggested they show their 'appreciation by going outside to enjoy the sunshine which will have a nourishing effect on both bodies and minds'

Outdoor space: Teachers claimed it was 'easier in an enclosed and crowded space for students who are tempted to be untruthful to copy or crib the answers from their friends'

'There is fresh air outdoors and the weather is fine in this season. 

Taking exams outdoors can also help the students feel healthier.'

It went down well with students like Chen Fang, who said: 'I love this. In the past, we took the exams in a similar way, but we were just asked to move chairs outdoors to take the exams.

'It's quite uncomfortable to just sit on a chair and take an exam, but now we have moved the desks outdoors. It has become quite comfortable now.'
