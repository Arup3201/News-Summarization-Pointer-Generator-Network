Floyd 'Money' Mayweather has lived up to his nickname once more following another self-indulgent video on Instagram.

The 37-year-old displayed his enormous wealth by uploading footage of him on Thursday being bathed by a Money Team assistant at his home.

Accompanied with the caption, 'This is how I get my day started, everyday. - MR. MY LIFE IS THE SH*T' the American boxer can be seen enjoying a soak from one of his glamorous assistants.

Mayweather, who is gearing up for a rematch with Marcos Maidana on September 13, is clearly having a good time in the tub - cheekily playing the 1988 song 'I Like' by three-piece group Guy in the background.

The tongue-in-cheek video begins with the lyrics 'the touch, you give me with your hands, when you caress my skin I'm under your command' as the unbeaten fighter gets his back scrubbed.

In taking a daily routine to a new level, thankfully Mayweather has no trouble brushing his teeth as he does that while enjoying his bath.

The video is the latest example of the pound-for-pound king flamboyantly showing off his fortune.

Already in August he has uploaded pictures of him in Versace clothing and posing in £20,000 Audemars Piguet (AP) watches alongside his daughter Iyanna.
