Want to channel the Kardashian sisters' style this New Year? Now you can because Kim, Khloe and Kourtney have unveiled their second range for Lipsy just in time for the party season.

After a sell-out debut collection for the high-street chain, which broke all of Lipsy's shopping records, the famous trio are back with a fun and flirty new range.

The new 14-piece line will contain nods to each of the sister’s signature style and will 'embrace Kim's 
glamorous vibe, Kourtney's eclectic taste and Khloe's edgy style' with biker jackets, floral bodycons and lace blouses.

There are bold floral prints and spiderweb lace embellished dresses, which come in midi-length bodycon shapes to reflect the Kardashian's love for figure-hugging silhouettes.

Thigh-high split dresses aim to offer a subtly sexy new design style to the range and campaign images of the girls wearing their new garments will be unveiled later this week.

Separates include wardrobe staples such as wrap front sheer blouses and ladylike pencil skirts, while outerwear includes a rocky monochrome printed biker jacket.

The trio originally had exclusive rights 
to sell their line at Dorothy Perkins, owned by Sir Philip Green's 
Arcadia Group, but a spokesperson for the high-street chain told 
MailOnline that after the contract ended, the girls decided to look at 
stocking their label elsewhere.

'We feel that it was an amazing launch
 pad into the UK market for the Kardashians but we didn't want to 
distract from Dorothy Perkins as a brand,' said a spokesperson for 
Dorothy Perkins at the time.

'At Dorothy
 Perkins we very much enjoyed working with the girls on their three 
exclusive collections between A/W 2012 and Summer 2013.

Racy lace: Separates include wardrobe staples from wrap front sheer blouses and ladylike pencil skirts (L) sheer top, £30, (C) peach blouse, £38, (R) black pencil skirt, £38

'We
 have continued to focus and strengthen the Dorothy Perkins own-bought collections, with a particular emphasis on style essentials, where our 
customer comes to us for trend-driven key pieces at great prices.

'It was therefore the right time to move 
on from the Kardashian Kollection project and we wish the girls and all 
of their team the very best for the future.'

Retailing from £30 to £75, the Kardashian Kollection is now sold at Lipsy, Lipsy.co.uk, Next.co.uk and all Next international websites, as well as at Very.co.uk, Bank and House of Fraser.
