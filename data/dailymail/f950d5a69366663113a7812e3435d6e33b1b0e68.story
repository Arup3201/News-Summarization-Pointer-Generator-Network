Craig Alexander, 32, has lost his £250,000 NHS job after it was discovered he had been convicted of armed robbery in 2007

An NHS chief has been sacked from his £250,000-a-year job after it was revealed that he is a  convicted armed robber.

Craig Alexander was jailed after holding up a busy Tesco Express store at gunpoint in 2001 and threatening staff and customers before fleeing with almost £1,250 in cash and cheques.

On his release he lied about his three-and-a-half-year stint in prison and was hired for the senior post of interim borough director at NHS Brent, where he was in charge of multi-million-pound taxpayer-funded budgets.

By the time he was exposed, the 32-year-old had been handling the health service’s Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention programme in the north-west London borough for 17 months.

His criminal past was revealed only after a member of staff who had complained about Alexander’s rudeness at work  looked him up online and discovered reports about the robbery. Questions are now being asked about why NHS bosses failed to carry out simple security checks on Alexander, of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, who was dismissed last week.

He was employed from last January through an agency and is believed to have taken home £1,000 a day – or about £250,000 a year.

He had lied on his CV and also failed to reveal his criminal past in order to get the job.

However, a simple Google search of his name quickly reveals newspaper reports on his sentencing, accompanied by his mugshot.

A colleague, who did not want to be 
named, said: ‘He was in charge of the entire QIPP budget for the trust –
which runs into millions.

'He has been at Brent over a year. It is very 
shocking that for a senior member of staff and in charge of budget 
issues, no checks were done before he took up his position, and it took a
member of staff to find out about his past and report it to the 
executive team.’

An NHS Brent spokesman said: ‘The person concerned was provided through a staffing agency.

‘We have now terminated our  contract with the individual from the agency for failing to disclose a criminal conviction.’

Alexander was 20 when he stole £1,140 
in cash and cheques worth £89.97 – later recovered – during the robbery 
at the Tesco store in Byfleet, Surrey.

He threatened two terrified  cashiers,
telling them to hand over money from the till, and pointed a gun at 
customers as he ordered them to get out.

But Alexander managed to escape 
justice for six years and had been carving out a successful career as an
NHS project manager until new evidence linked him to the convenience 
store robbery.

Police took his DNA and fingerprints 
when he was arrested for a separate offence in 2007 and were able to 
link him to prints found on a gun dumped near the Tesco hold-up.

Further tests were then conducted on clothing recovered from the scene, including a stocking which had been used as a mask.

Saliva on the stocking was also matched to Alexander.

Alexander admitted armed robbery at 
Guildford Crown Court in September 2007 and was jailed for three and a 
half years. During the sentencing, the judge said he had taken into 
account the fear of the shoppers in the store at the time, and felt a 
custodial sentence was the only punishment.

Alexander boasts in his profile  on 
professional networking site  LinkedIn that he is: ‘An experienced 
turnaround and operations director working at both strategic and 
operational level.’

QIPP is an NHS scheme designed to 
improve care and save £20billion by 2014/15, from commissioning care to 
overhauling how organisations are run, staffed and supplied.
