A Saudi judge has sentenced a political activist to 300 lashes and four years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy in Saudi Arabia, his rights group said on Sunday.

Omar al-Saeed is the fourth member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) to be jailed this year after the group issued statements attacking the ruling family over its human rights record and calling for democracy.

Saeed, who has also been issued with a worldwide travel ban for his so-called transgressions, did not have legal representation at the secret hearing when he was sentenced, ACPRA said in a statement on its website.

Harsh penalty: Under Saudi's Sharia or Islamic law, flogging is mandatory for a number of moral offences such as adultery. But it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments

All powerful: King Abdullah is the prime minister and he appoints the government, which includes top princes in the roles of foreign, interior, defence and intelligence ministers

And today he issued a scathing attack on the ruling elite who exacted the medieval punishment.

'I am the proud prisoner Omar Mohammed al-Saed,' he said in a statement. 'I read out to you the motives and causes of my imprisonment: my hatred of injustice, the fabrication of pain and misery, taking advantage of passive attitudes, treating them as if they were fools, and denying them their livelihoods for brutal personal ambition.'

'This unjust sentence is an honour and
pride to Omar al-Saed and a disgrace and shame to Judge Issa 
al-Matrudi,' the activist’s brother, Abdullah al-Saed, tweeted after 
learning of the sentence late on Thursday.

Under Saudi's Sharia or Islamic law, flogging is mandatory for a number of moral offences such as adultery or being alone in the company of an unrelated person of the opposite sex.

But it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments.

King Abdullah (pictured) has promoted some social reforms since taking the throne in 2005 but diplomats say he is held back by religious clerics and princes.

Cinemas and music concerts are banned, while many restaurants and even some shopping centres cater to families only, especially on holidays.

Religious police roam streets to make sure no unrelated men and women mix.

The Saudi court system is exclusively controlled Wahahbi/Salafi clerics, and bans the employment of non-Salafi citizens, especially as judges.

Saudi Arabia is the world's leading country in the use of  torture-by-flogging, public beheadings and publically crucifying condemned  prisoners.

Adam
Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, added: 'It's just
another troubling instance of Saudi authorities' absolute refusal to 
countenance any activism or criticism of Saudi policies or human rights 
abuses.'

A spokesman for the Justice Ministry said he could not comment on the report or confirm its accuracy.

U.S.-allied
Saudi Arabia is ruled by the al-Saud family together with powerful 
clerics from the country's ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Sunni 
Islam.

King Abdullah is the 
prime minister and he appoints the government, which includes top 
princes in the roles of foreign, interior, defence and intelligence 
ministers. Most senior princes also have extensive business interests.

Saudi
Arabia's only elections are for half the seats on relatively powerless 
town councils. Licensed media exercises stringent self censorship, 
public expressions of dissent are often not tolerated and demonstrations
are banned.

During the Arab
Spring in early 2011, protests were restricted to the Shi'ite minority 
in the Qatif district of Eastern Province.

Unrest
among the Sunni majority was avoided after King Abdullah pledged $110 
billion in spending on social benefits and top clerics and tribal 
leaders said people should back the ruling family.

Foreign
analysts say there appears to be little public demand for big political
changes in Saudi Arabia now, although they point to evidence on social 
media of growing frustration at corruption, poverty and poor state 
services.

The government has
denied charges by international rights groups that it used a campaign 
against Islamist militants over the past decade to stifle dissent.

However,
human rights lawyers inside the country have said some of those 
sentenced in security courts, including a group jailed in Jeddah in late
2011, were peaceful activists put on trial for demanding political 
change.

Saudi Arabia is one of the top five executioners in the world. The death penalty is still applied to a wide range of non-lethal crimes such as adultery, armed robbery, apostasy, drug smuggling, kidnapping, rape, 'witchcraft,' and 'sorcery.'
