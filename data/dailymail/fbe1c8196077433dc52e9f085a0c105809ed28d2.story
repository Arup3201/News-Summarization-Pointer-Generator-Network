If you suffer persistent bouts of heartburn for three weeks or longer, it could be a sign of cancer

Suffering persistent bouts of heartburn for three weeks or longer could be a sign of cancer, experts warned today. 

A new Be Clear On Cancer campaign is urging people to visit their doctor if they regularly fall victim to the condition.

The pain could indicate the symptoms of oesophageal or stomach cancer. 

It comes as a survey commissioned by Public Health England revealed just one in two people would visit their doctor if they had heartburn daily for three weeks or longer.

Heartburn, also known as acid reflux, is a form of indigestion that occurs when acid and digestive juices flow back up from the stomach to the gullet, which doesn't have a protective lining, so it causes inflammation and pain.  

Early diagnosis of oesophageal or stomach cancer is crucial, improving the chances treatment will be successful.

Around 67 per cent of people diagnosed with oesophago-gastric cancers at the earliest stage survive for at least five years.

That figure falls to around three per cent for those diagnosed at the late stage.

The new survey found 59 per cent of respondents did not know that heartburn could be a sign of cancer, with just 15 per cent saying they were certain it is a symptom.

The campaign also urges people to be vigilant in understanding that another symptom is difficulty swallowing food.

The survey revealed 70 per cent of people didn't know that food sticking in the throat could be a sign of cancer, and just 13 per cent of those surveyed said they were sure it is a sign.

Latest figures released by Public Health England show around 12,900 people in England are diagnosed with oesophago-gastric cancers each year, with approximately 10,200 people dying from the diseases each year.

This equates to 28 people dying from either oesophageal or stomach cancer each day. 

Oesophago-gastric cancers are the fourth and fifth most common cause of cancer death in men and women respectively.

It has been estimated that around 950 lives could be saved in England each year if our survival rates for oesophago-gastric cancers matched the best in Europe.

The UK, with the Netherlands, has the joint highest incidence rate of oesophageal cancer in males in the European Union and the highest incidence rate of oesophageal cancer in females in the European Union. 

This may be due to smoking, low consumption of fruit and vegetables over time, rising obesity levels and consuming alcohol on a regular basis.

Of those diagnosed with oesophago-gastric cancers, more than nine out of 10 people are over the age of 50, making this the target age group for the campaign.

A new Be Clear On Cancer campaign is today urging people who regularly suffer the condition to visit their doctor. It comes as a survey reveals just one in two people would consider seeing a GP over the condition

Baroness Gail Rebuck, Chair of Penguin Random House UK, lost her husband Philip Gould to oesophageal cancer three years ago.

She said: 'I understand from personal experience the devastating impact that oesophageal cancer can have.

Acid reflux, also known as heartburn, is the most frequent cause of indigestion in the UK.

It happens when the valve at the lower end of the oesophagus is abnormally relaxed and allows the stomach's acidic contents to flow back or 'reflux' into the gullet.

The acid, which wells up from the stomach to the throat, causes sharp acid and burning pains.

The main symptom is a painful or burning sensation in the throat and chest, which can radiate to the back, and last for up to three or four hours.

If a person suffers heartburn regularly it can cause permanent damage to the oesophagus, making it difficult and painful to swallow food.

Some people are more prone to the condition, the risk increased with conditions including weight gain, hernias and pregnancy, heavy smoking and drinking.

'I lost my husband Philip Gould to this cancer in 2011 when he was just 61. 

'I personally want to raise awareness of the symptoms and how important it is to go to the doctor if you have them. 

'What we see from the statistics is the earlier the cancer is caught, the better the chances of survival.'  

Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England,said it is vital people are aware of the signs to look out for. 

'People may be reluctant to visit their doctor about persistent heartburn, thinking that it's something they just have to live with,' he said.

'But heartburn most days for three weeks or more could be a sign of cancer. 

'The earlier cancer is diagnosed, the higher the chance of survival. 

'If we're to improve early diagnosis rates, we need to encourage people with symptoms to go to their doctor, which is what this latest Be Clear on Cancer campaign aims to do.'

Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England said: 'Early diagnosis of cancer is absolutely critical to improving survival.  

'Part of this is helping people understand what symptoms to look out for, which is why campaigns like this are so important.

Experts have warned heartburn, also known as acid reflux - a form of indigestion - could indicate a patient is suffering oesophageal or stomach cancer, pictured 

'Patients with possible early signs and symptoms should visit their GP so where necessary they can be referred for tests, and treatment can start quickly. 

'Early diagnosis is a key focus for us and will form part of the NHS's new five year strategy for cancer, currently being developed by an independent taskforce.'

Professor Michael Griffin, Professor of Surgery, Northern Oesophago-gastric Unit, said: 'Around 10,200 people in England die from either oesophageal or stomach cancer each year. 

'Earlier diagnosis makes curative treatment possible and could potentially save hundreds of lives. 

'Cancer campaigns like this, which encourage people to speak to their doctor if they have heartburn most days for three weeks or more, are vital. 

'You won't be wasting your doctor's time - you will either get reassurance that it isn't cancer, or if it is, you will have a better chance of successful treatment.'

The four-week campaign will see adverts running nationally throughout England on TV, radio and in the press with events taking place at a number of shopping centres across the country.
