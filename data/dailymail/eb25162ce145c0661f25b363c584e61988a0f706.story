Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal with a boxing routine as the England captain made light  of reportedly being knocked out in his own kitchen by a former team mate.

Pictures emerged on Saturday night appearing to show the Manchester United player being floored during a playfight in his £3.5million home with Stoke City defender Phil Bardsley.

After scoring the third goal in the Reds' match against Tottenham Hotspur yesterday, Rooney poked fun at the incident when he scored, celebrating by throwing fake punches before falling to the ground.

Pictures emerged last night showing the striker wearing boxing gloves as he and Bardsley - a former Manchester United player - went up against each other in a bout.

During the jovial night-in last month at his Cheshire mansion, Rooney found himself on the receiving end of a heavy punch.

The England player was said to have been visibly shaken by the blow during the incident and footage appeared to show him falling backwards after being struck.

Although the England forward could face a grilling from Manchester United chiefs, who are said to pay the striker £300,000 per week, Rooney seemed to be treating the incident as nothing more than a bit of light-hearted fun.

After scoring the third goal in yesterday's match in Manchester, Rooney ran to the crowd before pumping his fists. He then closed his eyes before falling backwards to the Old Trafford turf.

Even referee Mark Clattenburg appeared to see the funny side of the Manchester United and England striker's celebration

Speaking of the kitchen playfight, a source told The Sun: 'Wayne had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that. He made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed, not moving.

'People were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage. Everybody realised it was a stupid thing to do, but they just got carried away.'

The incident is said to have come the day after United suffered defeat at Swansea, while his wife Coleen and their children Kai and Klay were on holiday in Barbados.

The clip is said to last around a minute and shows pair trading blows and friends laugh and joke.

According to the Sun, the pair's bout intensifies before Bardsley delivers the knockout punch, which leaves Rooney lying flat out on the kitchen floor.

The incident could leave Rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

Mr van Gaal is unlikely to be impressed with the 29-year-old for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training.

This is due to most footballers having clauses in their contracts banning them from taking part in certain activities to prevent the risk of them being injured.

Bardsley is a former team-mate of Rooney's with the pair having played together at Manchester United before the Scotland international left and signed for Sunderland in 2008.

He moved to Stoke City last year and his wife Tanya has also recently found fame, starring in ITV reality show The Real Housewives of Cheshire. Mrs Bardsley, 33, said the video was just a joke.

She claimed on Twitter that the clip was a ‘clever edit’, adding: ‘Two mates having a laugh - video doesn't show Wayne jumping up and laughing with Phil.’

Rooney comes from a big boxing background and is often photographed at ringside during high-profile bouts.

Speaking seven years ago, Rooney said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career.

'I think my boxing training was beneficial in my development as a footballer, especially breaking through to the Premier League at such a young age,' he said in 2008.

The incident happened at his £3.5million home while his wife Coleen, pictured, was on holiday in Barbados with their children

'I needed that extra bit of strength that the boxing training had given me. It made it easier to play than it might have been and it's helped me with the way my game is now.

'All through my life - from the ages of six, seven and eight - when big fights were on television, I used to stay up with my dad to watch them.

'I've always loved watching boxing and I went boxing training for about three or four years when I was younger. It's a sport I've always been involved in.

'I was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when I was about 15. But Everton, who I was with at the time, said I had to concentrate on one of them - and I opted for football.'
