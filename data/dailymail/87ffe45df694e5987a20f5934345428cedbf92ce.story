Pensioners: Robin Daykin, 74, and wife Annette, 62, from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, have sold their croft and piled their life savings into a high performance 600c superbike with sidecar

They are at an age when they could be forgiven for putting their feet up and relaxing a little.

But pensioners Robin Daykin, 74, and wife Annette, 62, who live in Scotland have no plans to slow down in life.

In fact, they are taking part in one of the fastest and most dangerous motorbike races on the planet.

The husband-and-wife team sold their croft and threw themselves headlong into the world of high-performance superbikes.

They gave up a lifetime of farming to invest in a 600cc superbike with sidecar – so they can compete in TT races.

While their friends are content with a bus pass, these grandparents will soon be tearing round the track taking on riders less than half their age on the gruelling Formula Two circuit in this month’s famous Isle of Man races.

The couple, from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, packed up and sold their croft eight years ago and dipped into their savings to finance a new thrill in life.

Mr Daykin convinced his wife they should invest in a classic Royal Enfield motorbike and sidecar to race.

Mrs Daykin said the couple’s three children – Nicola, Damian and Tree – were all grown up with their own families and so, after retiring they decided to revive an old passion for motorbikes

She said: ‘Neither of us wanted a quiet life. This is our time to go out and have fun.’

After some gentle persuasion, she agreed to join her partner in calmer Classic Club races.

But they soon became bored and decided to upgrade to a super-powered 600cc Yamaha R6 and sidecar to compete in the Formula Two circuit.

Performance: Robin and Annette Daykin in their leathers trialling their 'Team Past It' 600c superbike with sidecar in which they compete in TT races around the world

Thrills and spills: Annette Daykin falling from at Scotland's East Fortune track in 2008 during a race in their 600cc motorbike with sidecar

Skid: The couple on their Team Past It bike crashing during a TT race last year - luckily neither of them were hurt in the incident

They have raced under the banner of Team Past It after a young competitor told Mr Daykin he was too slow.

The Daykins – who have six grandchildren – moved to Scotland from Yorkshire in 1985, and have built up a strong following, even winning the best newcomer award.

Mr Daykin, who turns 75 next week, first competed in sidecar racing at the Manx Grand Prix mountain circuit in 1957, aged 20.

Now, they are gearing up to battle against some of the world’s fastest drivers at next month’s races.

And this won’t be the couple’s first time on the circuit.

Upgrade: Team Past It at the Czech TT in 2005 before Robin and Annette Daykin found their old Royal Enfield wasn't fast enough and putting their life savings into a high performance 600c superbike with sidecar

Experience: Robin Daykin when he was 20-years-old racing at the Manx Gran Prix in 1957 on the Isle of Man where he will with wife Annette later this month

Mrs Daykin said: ‘Last time we went to the Isle of Man we had a fabulous time and we can’t wait to go back.’

Mr Daykin has already fought his way through troubles that would have finished many a track career.

Three years ago he learned he had prostate cancer and then weeks later he suffered a broken neck in a horror high-speed crash.

He said: ‘I had a bit of a rough time. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then I broke my neck in a racing accident in Wales.

‘But despite all the pain, it’s safe to say my fortunes really turned around. 12 weeks later, I had fully recovered from both the prostate cancer and the broken neck.’

Now, the couple can’t wait to get racing again.

Mr Daykin said: ‘It will be great to get going in the Isle of Man.’
