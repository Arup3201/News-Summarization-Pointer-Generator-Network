Australian model Rhys Uhlich has lashed out at Facebook administrators after the site removed a photo he posted of his family in the bath.

Uhlich, whose career was launched in 2007 by Make Me a Supermodel, shared an intimate family shot showing him with his partner Claire Virgona and their two daughters Indah and Mahli, with the caption 'nothing like a family scrub'.

Facebook moderators removed the photo because the shot was deemed inappropriate by Facebook's 'community standards regarding nudity', which Uhlich and many of his followers see as double standards.

Uhlich, the host of Coxy's Big Break, posted a screenshot of the removed content with the caption, 'Are you serious Facebook? Im guessing someone was offended by this.. To me this is happiness, but obviously Facebook prefers chicks getting their cans out.'

Many of his followers were outraged by the move, and pointed to the constant stream of arguably inappropriate content that bombards them every day on the site with no intervention.

'Maybe Facebook should worry about the r rated videos that is constantly in my newsfeed. This pic is gorgeous, how ridiculous!', said one user.

Several of Uhlich followers pointed to the recent 'Break the Internet' photoshoot featuring Kim Kardashian which appeared uncensored on the site

'I thought it was a great family photo, nothing at all wrong with it!', another commented.

Several of Uhlich followers pointed to the recent 'Break the Internet' photo shoot featuring Kim Kardashian which appeared uncensored on the site. 

'They've removed baby photos of me. Yet Kim Kardashian's photos are all over my newsfeed. It's so ridiculous,' said one user.

Another was more satirical, and said the photo was removed because 'you didn't balance a champagne glass on your bum.'

Facebook's nudity policy states that the site  has a 'strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved,'

'We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.'

Some on the site raised this point, calling the photo 'beautiful', 'gorgeous,' 'lovely,' and labelling it a 'great family photo.'

One specifically said, 'This is natural beauty as is breast feeding. Don't give up!'

One user pointed out that she had been advised not to post pictures of the children she nannied as paedophiles targeted social media sites looking for nudity, and said that before it had been pointed out the thought had not even occurred to her. 

'It's sad that that's the world we live in. Maybe Facebook are attempting to protect your gorgeous girls in this instance?' she asked.

Before 2014, photographs of mothers breastfeeding were banned from the site under their nudity policy, which was reversed after a feminist writer from Women, Action, and the Media launched a campaign against what she saw as 'gender-based hate speech'. 

After receiving 60,000 tweets and 5,000 emails in support of the movement, Facebook answered the call to refine it's approach to the broader issue and included breastfeeding as allowable content, while still deeming other exposure of women's nipple inappropriate.

In a response from the site last year, Facebook said that they continually 'work hard to make our platform a safe and respectful place for sharing and connection. This requires us to make difficult decisions and balance concerns about free expression and community respect.'
