DJ decks powered by the sun could soon be coming to a street near you.

And you don’t even need a back catalogue of records to show off your musical talent – all that’s required is a smartphone and some good weather.

The technology, dubbed Fono, allows budding DJs to place their device in the middle of set so that it can amplify the audio.

Fun in the sun: Budding DJs  place their device in the middle of the Fono's mobile pickup pad so the DJ decks can amplify the audio

The solar panels are fitted to the roof of the DJ booth and users can use the decks to mix their music.

Based on a professional DJ set, the decks feature a crossfader as well as Scratch, Filter, Pitch, Delay, Flanger and Crush effects.

The system is also hooked up to an battery-system that is charged by the sun during the day, allowing the Fono set to be played at night.

The creators of the eco-friendly DJ booth, Yalp InterActive a Dutch-Finnish company, said the Fono DJ table is intended to be a meeting place for young people.

They want the technology to ‘challenge them to express themselves in a creative way.’

Rather than streaming music on their phone is unsociable settings, such as public transport, the team hope the technology could help develop a hub of creativity.

Fono designer, Rob Tuitert said: ‘The Fono is a unique product that relates to trends among young people.’

All the electronics are encased inside the concrete table, making them resistant to both harsh weather and vandalism attempts.

The team said a variety of the £19,800 ($33,200) Fono systems are available in Amsterdam, the Hague and in the small city of Made in the Netherlands.

Elsewhere in Europe, Fono systems can be found in Helsinki in Finland, Enköping in Sweden and Solrød in Denmark.
