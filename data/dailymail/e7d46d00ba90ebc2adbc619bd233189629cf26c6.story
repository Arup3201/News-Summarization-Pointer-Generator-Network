Former England midfielder Gareth Barry has hit out at criticism of Wayne Rooney, saying that every England player would want Roy Hodgson to stick with the Manchester United man against Uruguay.

Barry, who played alongside Rooney for the Three Lions at the South Africa 2010 World Cup, also claims England need the 28-year-old if they are 'going to do something' in this summer's tournament.

Rooney came under fire for a below par performance against Italy in England's World Cup opener, despite laying on an assist for Daniel Sturridge in the first-half.

And Barry says Rooney's telling contribution in Manaus showed just why England would be lost without him.

'How many forwards playing out of position on the left wing could produce a cross like that with their weaker foot?' said Barry on social media app Fanzai.

'I can’t believe there’s a debate on whether Wayne Rooney should be starting for England. He has to be one of the first names on the sheet.

Valuable asset: Barry says Rooney's team-mates will still see him as the first player they want on the field

'I assure you every player in that changing room would want him in the team. If we are going to do something at this tournament which I still think we definitely can we need Wayne Rooney in the side.'

Rooney is without a goal in nine World Cup appearances but was not helped by being placed out on the left wing against Italy, rather than in his favoured number 10 role.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, touted as a potential replacement for Rooney, took another step towards full fitness on Monday, taking part in his first training session since picking up a knee injury.

Rooney admitted his placed was under-threat on Monday and said: ‘Why would I feel my place in the team is guaranteed?'

'I work hard to try and get into that team. I’ve never said my place is guaranteed. I don’t expect to play.

‘We have got a lot of good, young players. We all give the manager different options and whoever he picks then I’m sure we will all respect that.’
