Supermarkets have launched emergency investigations following claims that contaminated chicken is being sold on the high street.

Whistleblowers say the public is being put at risk because of suspect practices at two of the largest UK poultry processors, the 2 Sisters Food Group and Faccenda. 

A hygiene alert has been raised around factories and farms supplying chicken to Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Marks & Spencer and Nando’s.

The allegations, which are denied by the two firms, have prompted Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer to launch inquiries into the way their chicken is produced.

Concerns about poor hygiene standards come at a time of mounting concern that supermarkets are failing to protect customers from food-poisoning bug campylobacter – which is most often found on raw chicken, and is responsible for around 100 deaths a year.

An official study published in 2009 found two thirds of all fresh chicken on shelves was contaminated with it. 

The whistleblowers claim failures they saw at the operations run by 2 Sisters and Faccenda are likely to spread bugs. 

The allegations, which first appeared on The Guardian website, are denied by the companies, while the supermarkets all insist that their own audit systems ensure that the meat reaching the high street is safe. The insiders claim that: 

The allegations have prompted supermarkets including Tesco to launch their own inquiries

The alert was raised after the Daily Mail revealed how supermarkets have been secretly lobbying official watchdogs to stop them naming and shaming stores selling contaminated chicken.

Yesterday, the board of the Food Standards Agency decided to drop a previous pledge to publish quarterly surveys identifying which stores are selling chicken contaminated with the bug.

The decision followed pressure from retailers, producers and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

The move was widely criticised by food safety experts, academics, consumer groups and even several of the board members.

Erik Millstone, of the University of Sussex, said: ‘The decision of the FSA board is deeply disappointing, and shows it has abandoned its commitment to put the interests of consumers ahead of the interests of the food industry.’ 

The allegations about the two food firms were partly based on information supplied by Ron Spellman, director general of EWFC, which represents meat inspectors across the EU.

Probe: Marks & Spencer said it launched an immediate investigation into these allegations

EWFC has been lobbying against a scaling back of inspections at meat plants that have been introduced by the EU and backed by the FSA.

Tesco said: ‘We take these allegations of poor practice against one of our suppliers extremely seriously, and have launched an immediate investigation.   

‘Customers can be assured that we conduct our own stringent quality checks on fresh chicken received from suppliers before it is placed on shelves, so we can be confident that it meets our very high quality and safety standards.’ 

Sainsbury’s said: ‘Customers can be confident in the safety of products bought from our stores. We perform regular independent and in-house checks to ensure these standards are met and are investigating these allegations with 2 Sisters.’

Sainsbury's was another supermarket accused of selling chicken which has been contaminated

A hygiene alert has been raised around factories and farms supplying chicken to Tesco Asda and Aldi

M&S said: ‘We take food safety very seriously and regularly audit all of our suppliers to ensure they meet our strict codes of practice. We do not tolerate any alleged breach of our standards and have launched an immediate investigation into these allegations.’ 

Asda referred enquiries to its suppliers. Both Nando’s and KFC said they were confident that their suppliers operate to high hygiene and welfare standards. 

Aldi said: ‘We take any claims of this nature very seriously. Aldi works with our suppliers to ensure the high standards we expect are adhered to.’

Both Nando's and KFC said they were confident that their suppliers operate to high hygiene and welfare standards

The 
allegations of malpractice relate to 2 Sisters’ plants in Anglesey, 
Wales, and Scunthorpe, and a farm and abattoir operated by Faccenda.

2
 Sisters said: ‘The allegations about our processing sites are untrue, 
misleading and inaccurate. Both have British Retail Consortium “A” grade
 Food Standards certifications, based on a number of announced and 
unannounced visits.

‘Our 
Scunthorpe site has already surpassed the Food Standards Agency’s 2013 
targets to reduce campylobacter levels, and continues to work towards 
the 2015 target.’

Faccenda said: ‘We operate under the Red Tractor standard, and are always looking for ways to further improve.

'We are investing heavily across our business to identify ways of reducing the risk of campylobacter.’
