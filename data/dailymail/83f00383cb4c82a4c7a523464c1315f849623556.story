Madonna has admitted she felt 'too humiliated' to tell police she had been raped at knifepoint at the age of 19.

The singer spoke about the attack during an interview with Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show on Wednesday.

When asked by the shock jock if she had ever reported the traumatic incident, Madonna said she hadn't, explaining: ‘You've already been violated. It's just not worth it. It's too much humiliation.’

Difficult discussion: Madonna talked about being raped at 19 during an interview with Howard Stern on Wednesday, for his SiriusXM radio show

The now-56-year-old revealed in October 2013 that she was raped shortly after she moved to New York City from Michigan.

Madonna said on Wednesday that she ‘was in shock’, and ‘didn't know a soul’ after relocating, adding that she ‘trusted everybody’.

‘I was saying “hi” to people on the streets like a dork,’ she recalled.

Speaking about the moments that led to the attack, the pop star revealed: ‘I was going to a dance class and the door was locked and I needed money for the pay phone. [A man] gave it to me. He was a very friendly guy. I trusted everybody.’ 

Madonna said the man told her she could make the call from his house, and once she was there he raped her.

She first revealed that she was sexually assaulted during a Harper’s Bazaar interview in 2013, and said she was attacked on a rooftop at knifepoint.

Despite the difficult discussion about the harrowing incident, Madonna still managed to have a light-hearted chat about her relationships during another portion of the interview with Howard.

The Living For Love hit-maker admitted that Warren Beatty, who she dated for 15 months, was an incredible lover, adding: ‘I’m not going to lie.’

Madonna said she wasn’t jealous of his beautiful exes, who included Brigitte Bardot, Elle Macpherson and Julie Christie. ‘I have confidence in my skills,’ she explained. 

She was however ‘insecure sometimes’ during her eight-year marriage to Guy Ritchie, when her director husband would be heading to work with a stunning actress. 

'I think I threw a tantrum once': Madonna admitted she felt insecure when husband Guy Ritchie would go to work with a beautiful actress. The former couple are seen in 2008, a few months before their divorce

‘I think I threw a tantrum once,’ Madonna said, also telling Howard that she ‘wished’ she’d had a romance with Evita co-star Antonio Banderas.

The pop icon later confirmed rumours that she secretly dated Tupac Shakur. 

Madonna was criticised for trivialising important issues in December after comparing the leak of 13 unfinished demos from her album Rebel Heart to 'rape' and 'terrorism'.

'This is artistic rape!!' she said in an Instagram post which was then removed. 'These are early leaked demo's half of which wont even make it on my album the other half have changed and evolved.

'This is a form of terrorism. Wtf!!!! Why do people want to destroy artistic process??? Why steal? Why not give me the opportunity to finish and give you my very best?'

Madonna stood by her statement in an interview with The Guardian shortly afterwards. She said: 'Obviously there is a person, or a group of people behind this that were essentially terrorising me. I don't want to sound alarming, but certainly that's how I felt.

'It's one thing if someone comes into your house and steals a painting off your wall: that's also a violation, but, your work, as an artist, that's devastating.

'I'm an artistic person, I'm very expressive. I'm sorry if words alarm people, but that's what it felt like. It was not a consensual agreement. I did not say, "Hey, here's my music, and it's finished." It was theft.'
