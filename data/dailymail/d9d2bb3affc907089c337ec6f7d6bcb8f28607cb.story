For residents of the New Forest, coming face to face with one of the national park's many wild animals is an everyday occurrence.

But shoppers in Brockenhurst have admitted even they were a little shocked when a donkey wandered into their local Tesco hunting for a bite to eat.

The ass' trip to the supermarket was prompted by scallywag students, who tempted him in with a trail of breadcrumbs.

Staff then had to pick up baskets and bash them together to usher him out again.

Student Charlie Lambeth, 17, said: 'I have never seen anything like it.

'The donkey just wandered in and out so casually.'

Shopper Hannah Parkinson, 18, said: 'It's not something you see every day.'

The New Forest is famed for its wild animals, with ponies, donkeys, cattle and even pigs free wander the national park.

But its pony is the most famous, which has it has grazed since as far back as 1016.

The breed is famously hardy and sure-footed, and they make good, strong riding ponies.

People in the Forest with property with common rights - allowing them to put ponies out on the Forest to graze - are known as 'commoners'. Each pony is owned by a commoner.

Several pony sales are held every year, and in autumn the ponies are rounded up for health checks and branding.

There are around 100 wild donkeys which are allowed to roam free in the New Forest and the Tesco store have admitted it is not the first time one has visited.

Tristan Russell, 22, team leader at 
the shop, said: 'A college student led a trail of breadcrumbs leading 
the donkey into the store.

'When
 I saw it get about half way in I rushed to try and get it back out by 
clapping my hands and banging shopping baskets together.

'I asked the students not to do it again but they found it highly amusing.

'It's not the first time a donkey has come into the store. They wander around the high street so it's not that unusual.

'It's probably happened around half a dozen times in the last eight or nine months.'
