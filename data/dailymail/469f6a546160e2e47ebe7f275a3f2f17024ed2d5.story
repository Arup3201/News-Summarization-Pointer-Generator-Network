An innovative new product has emerged from Silicon Valley which fits over your mattress and works to improve your slumber.

The Luna mattress cover - which costs between $179 and $229 depending on its size - tracks the user's sleeping patterns using hundreds of tiny sensors to analyse breathing frequency, heart rate, temperature and movement.

It learns your regular bed time, then heats your bed to optimum levels, tracks the quality of your shut-eye and wakes you up in the morning during a light sleep phase - making rising easier - by syncing with the Luna app on your phone.

Worth getting into bed for: The Luna mattress cover - which costs between $179 and $229 depending on its size - tracks the user's sleeping patterns using hundreds of tiny sensors

The Luna, which is machine washable and runs in sizes from Full to California King, can currently be pre-ordered and is scheduled to ship in August.

The futuristic mattress cover boasts dual-zone controls, which means its sensors can track you and your partner's side of the bed separately, then adjust temperature levels accordingly.

Microphone sensors can even tell whether either of you snored the previous night, and if so, who and how frequently.

Luna's co-founder, tech entrepreneur Matteo Franceschetti, based in San Francisco, California, developed the mattress cover to solve his own sleep problems.

'Everything around us is getting smarter, except our beds,' he says.

Mr Franceschetti estimates that in his seven years as a CEO, he has lost approximately 900 hours of sleep due to his restless legs syndrome.

Several sleep disorders, according to WebMD, can be improved by regulating the temperature of your sleeping environment.

The symptoms of restless legs syndrome, for example, which is an insomnia-inducing disorder characterized by an impulse to shift the legs around erratically, can be eased with the use of heating sleeping pads.

Talk to me: The Luna works with an app (pictured) that provides detailed data about your previous night's sleep and lets you customize its settings

For customers who have 'smart-enabled' gadgets in their homes - such as app-controlled security systems, lights, thermostats and coffee brewers - the Luna can sync with them too.

That means that when you get into bed, the Luna will automatically signal your doors to lock, your burglar alarm to activate, your lights to switch off and your central heating to adjust.

And when you wake up in the morning, it can tell your coffee machine that you've just stepped out of bed and have your beans brewing for you faster than you can say 'triple espresso'.

An Indiegogo campaign to fund the last stages of Luna's production process launched yesterday and hit its $100,000 goal in just six hours.

As of today, it has raised more than $340,000.
