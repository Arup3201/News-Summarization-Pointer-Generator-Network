For ice fisherman looking to quench their thirst and warm their bodies in frozen conditions, a drone delivering beer seemed like the perfect idea.

But now the FAA has ruled Lakemaid Beer, based at Steven's Point, Wisconsin, can no longer operate their test aircraft to deliver beverages to fishermen, after raising safety concerns.

Lakemaid, which calls itself 'the fisherman's lager', had hoped to use the pilotless aircraft to potentially deliver drinks to thousands of anglers trying their luck in icy conditions.

Idea with bottle: Lakemaid Beer had wanted to use drones to deliver beverages to ice fisherman, but the FAA has grounded the idea over safety concerns

Bringemethenews.com
 reported that customers could call in orders with their specific 
GPS coordinates. A clerk would then take their order and ship the box of 12 
brews to whichever ice-house  requested it.

A video showing the brewers testing out the idea on Lake Waconia went viral after it was posted last week and has now gathered 85,000 views.

But the government ruled that the company's next test, which was set for Minnesota's Lake Mille Lacs and the Twin Pines resort cannot proceed.

'We were a little surprised at the FAA 
interest in this since we thought we were operating under the 400-foot 
limit,' said Lakemaid managing partner Jack Supple via email to npr.org via email.

He added that the beer-makers 'figured a 
vast frozen lake was a lot safer place than [what] Amazon was showing on
 60 Minutes.'

In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos revealed his company's plans to use drones for same-day delivery.

But the FAA rules do not allow drones to be used for commercial delivery, although it has scheduled a review.

Following the publication of Lakeland's viral video, the FAA contacted the firm to say it broke numerous regulations, ranging from the operator's rating to the use of airspace.

Although disappointed, Supple understands the FAA's concern.

'Drones whizzing around piloted by any knucklehead is probably not the 
Jetsons future we all imagined.'

In a statement to Breitbart.com, he added: 'They think it’s a great idea, though they’re telling me to stop.'

There are also other issues with the idea that need to be worked out, including checking buyers' ids to ensure that they are not underage and developing drones that can carry a 12 pack further than half a mile.

In the meantime, beer drone supporters have begun a White House petition to get the aircraft airborne again.
