A rare blue-plumed parrot believed to be one of the very last of its kind to have been born in the wild and the inspiration behind a hit movie has died in Brazil.

The Spix's macaw named Presley was believed to have been about 40 years old when he died Wednesday outside São Paulo.

He is believed to have been the inspiration behind the 2011 animated movie Rio and its sequel Rio 2, which was released in 2014, about a Spix's macaw called Blu.

Dying breed: Presley the Spix's macaw has died after a tumultuous life that saw him living in Europe and North America before being returned to his native Brazil

A blow for conservation: It was hoped that Presley would be able to add diversity to the tiny gene pool of the Spix's macaw, but he never produced any offspring

Presley's species is critically endangered, and the native Brazilian birds are thought by experts to be extinct in the wild.

His death is a blow to conservation efforts, because Presley represented an opportunity in inject some diversity into the remaining gene pool, which is thought to consist of fewer than 100 birds worldwide in captive breeding programs.

According to National Geographic, the species is vulnerable to genetic defects caused by inbreeding.

But Presley never had any offspring after deforestation, animal trafficking and introduced species left Spix's macaws decimated and he himself spent many years away from his native forests.

Presley was smuggled out of his birthplace in the São Francisco Valley in northern Bahia in the 1970s and was traded among several private bird collectors in Europe before he wound up in the U.S.

An avian veterinarian was amazed when more than a decade ago she received a call to examine an ailing blue macaw named Presley in Colorado and recognized it as a Spix’s.

The lone macaw was depressed after losing its companion of many years, an Amazon parrot, living in a small cage, unwell and unable to fly.

After six months of rehabilitation he was returned to Brazil, where he lived in the São Paulo Zoo before being moved to the Lymington Foundation, a refuge and breeding facility for rare parrots in the forest outside the city.

Rare: The Spix's macaw is a medium-sized parrot that weighs about 300 grams. Their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it's believed Presley was about 40

'He was very affectionate – just a very congenial bird, very chirpy, very talkative. He loved visitors,' Bill Wittkoff, Lymington's executive director told National Geographic.

'He's got an aviary that we'd wheel in and out, for the cold in wintertime and because of very, very hot sun. We'd go by his aviary often and he'd always gives us a chirp, a hello.'

Bill and his wife Linda Wittkoff, who is director of the facility, tried breeding Presley with another Spix's macaw, but they produced sterile eggs.

They still had hopes for Presley's ability to breed by artificial insemination, but before they could try it Presley began to sicken.

Chirpy: Presley was affectionate and talkative, say his carers Bill and Linda Wittkoff

It was discovered over the past year that he had an irregular heartbeat and when he went off his food last week, the Wittkoffs took him to a vet.

They believed he'd recover, but he never rallied and at 7am Wednesday morning he died.

'To us, Presley is a symbol of the best and worst in mankind,' the Wittkoffs wrote in a letter announcing his death.

'The love, care, concern and effort to help and preserve [on one side], with the greed, selfishness, and lack of concern for the animal world on the other side.'
