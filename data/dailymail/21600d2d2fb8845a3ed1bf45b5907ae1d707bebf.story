A Michigan woman accused of lying for years about having cancer was convicted on Thursday in a separate case of falsely accusing two men of rape.

The jury took less than 30 minutes to convict Sara Ylen after a three-day trial in St. Clair County, 60 miles northeast of Detroit.

Ylen was charged with making up a story of two men attacking her in her Lexington home in 2012. Ylen, 38, was also convicted of tampering with evidence after police said she used makeup to create what looked like bruises. She did not testify in her own defense.

Ylen's story resembled a 'cheap novel,' prosecutor Suzette Samuels told jurors.

'She's lying through her teeth. ... This was unreal,' Samuels said.

In final remarks, defense attorney David Heyboer said police did not follow up on other leads and didn't go to Ylen's house for a close examination of what took place.

Judge Daniel Kelly revoked Ylen's bond and sent her to jail to await sentencing on Jan. 17.

Her legal problems, however, are far from over.

Ylen faces trial on Feb. 4 in neighboring Sanilac County, where she's charged with fraud and false pretenses for claiming she had cancer.

Her story raised eyebrows: Ylen claimed she was raped in a parking lot in broad daylight and in her recent rape claim she used cosmetics to create bruises

Ylen received months of hospice care and thousands of dollars from sympathetic supporters, but there's no evidence that she had cancer, according to the state police.

The criminal cases have stunned people here in the eastern Michigan area known as the Thumb. Ylen is well-known locally after talking to the Port Huron Times Herald years ago for a series of stories about being a rape victim. She said she was attacked in daylight in the parking lot of a Meijer store, a major retailer.

The man she accused, James Grissom, insisted he was innocent. He served about a decade in prison before his 2003 conviction was overturned last year based on new evidence about Ylen's credibility.

All eyes on Sara: Grissom was convicted or raping Ylen in 2001 and spent 10 years in prison--her recent false claim that two men raped in her 2012 was too much for Grissom to ignore

James Grissom, an off-duty Meijer 
employee with a past sex-related conviction, was charged after Ylen said
 her attacker, like Grissom, had a skull tattoo.

Readers inspired by 'Sara's Story', as the series was titled, started a fund to send her to community college.

But
 it didn't take long for Ylen's story to start unraveling. Authorities 
learned she claimed to have been kidnapped and raped while visiting her 
parents in Bakersfield, California, just months after the alleged 
parking lot attack back in Michigan. No charges were filed.

Grissom was a spectator this week during Ylen's false rape trial.

'Strange. The last time I was coming down to this courtroom I had handcuffs on,' Grissom told the Times Herald. "I figured I had to be here, just to see what she gets away with and what she don't.'

Ylen's community, which had come to 
admire her as the subject of a newspaper's award-winning 2003 series 
about surviving a rape, rallied when her cancer diagnosis became public.

Churches sold Super Bowl sub sandwiches and auction items to raise 
money. Friends cut her grass.

One of her close friends, Carol Connell, spoke of the gift she gave Ylen, in a bid to help give her hope in her time of need.

'It
 was a little box, a very ornate box, to hold a prayer. She needed God 
to look over her,' Connell said, recalling the 2008 lunch when she gave 
Ylen the jewelry. 'Sara was visibly touched.'

Connell now can't help but wonder whether Ylen was showing gratitude or simply perpetuating years of jaw-dropping deceit.

Always the victim: Sara's ex-husband discovered his wife was lying when she wouldn't let him visit her in the hospital despite driving for miles

'The
 fact that she's lived this long is a miracle. But maybe it wasn't a 
miracle after all. ... I'm just baffled. Is she the biggest con artist 
in the state of Michigan or the victim?' Connell said.

She
 claimed she was a patient at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in 
Zion, Ill., but the hospital said Ylen never was treated there. During 
pre-trial hearings, prosecutors disclosed forged documents with 
University of Michigan medical center letterhead.

Just about a year ago, Ylen was in a wheelchair at a Croswell Wesleyan Church auction and spaghetti dinner that raised $10,800.

Here for the show: 'Strange. The last time I was coming down to this courtroom I had handcuffs on,' Grissom told the Times Herald. "I figured I had to be here, just to see what she gets away with and what she don't'

'I
 thought I was doing something good for someone who had cancer. It's 
like a bad Lifetime movie,' said event organizer Sue Birtles.

'I've heard that some people want their money back. ... I'm working on forgiveness.'

Mercy
 Hospice, which visited Ylen at her home, declined to comment on her 
care but said in a statement that any terminal illness typically 'must 
be certified' by a patient's doctor before services are provided.

Ylen's
 ex-husband, Jim, declined to comment on the criminal charges against 
his former wife, but divorce records indicate he had long doubted her 
tales of woe.

The couple were married in 1993, separated in 2007 and divorced in 2011.

Judge Daniel Kelly found her guilty as charged and sent Sara to Jail until her sentencing on January 17th

Time to think: Sara will serve jail time for her actions and will anyone feel sorry for her?

The
 marriage 'broke down due to the wife's complex lies and deceit 
involving fictitious rapes, kidnappings, pregnancies and illnesses â€“ all
 attempts to control others by complaining of physical symptoms,' Jim 
Ylen's attorney, Aaron Cassell, said in a court filing.

Sara
 Ylen told her husband the name of her cancer doctor, but he later 
learned there was no physician by that name in Michigan, Cassell said.

And
 she wouldn't let him join her at medical appointments, even after 
driving hundreds of miles to Cancer Treatment Centers of America in 
Zion, Ill.

Psychologist Daniel Kachman evaluated
 Ylen as part of the divorce case and told the judge: 'Often feeling 
dependent and dejected and fearful of rebuff, she may either withdraw 
from painful social relationships or decide to adapt the role of 
martyr.'

Mike Connell, the newspaper columnist, said he regrets not treating his own doubts more seriously.

'Sara
 is innocent until proven guilty, but if she did pull off an elaborate 
con, consider what genius it required,' he said in an email.

'She has a brilliant mind. I recognized that straightaway.'
