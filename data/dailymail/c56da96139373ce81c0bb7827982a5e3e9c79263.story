Staring directly into the camera, Cassidy, her striking electric blue eyeshadow dominating her face, appears defiant - despite her nakedness. One of the hundreds of women who live and work in Nevada's legal brothels, she appears Jane Hilton's new book, Precious, and her story still haunts the British photographer.

'Her [Cassidy's] story is so tragic but she has turned her tragedy around and is such a positive beautiful person inside and out,' says Jane. 'She saw her mother murdered at the age of six, along with her three-year-old brother.

'She was brought up by her grandparents and managed to find forgiveness for [her mother's] murderer, her mum's boyfriend. Not only is she trying to become a successful business woman, but her main goal in life is to help the homeless and to build a halfway house to accommodate anyone in that situation. I felt humbled by her.'

Jane first came across Nevada's prostitutes in 2003 after an unscheduled stop at a brothel named Madame Kitty's Cathouse during a road trip from Las Vegas.

Her visit resulted in a BBC documentary named Love For Sale which shed light on the lives of the women working in Nevada's brothels, the oldest of which has been in operation since 1902.

'It was very challenging,' says Jane of making the documentary, 'and I joke that I am sure I will end up having some serious therapy sessions about it one day.

'I think [visiting the brothels] makes me realise how lucky I am and that I was dealt a good set of cards at the beginning of my life, which sadly is not the case for everyone.

'It has also made me realise how amazing some of the women I have met inside the brothels are, who were dealt a bad set of cards at the beginning, and turned things around against all the odds.

'There are some quite incredible girls whose life stories are unbelievably sad, tragic, unusual, upbeat, extraordinary. I have enormous respect for them and feel totally privileged that they allowed me into their lives.'

Others to feature in the new exhibition include Porsha, a blonde older woman who sits squarely on her red velvet bed smiling demurely into the camera and pregnant Nikki Lee.

One of the most striking images features a brothel worker named Ruby, who looks wearily into the camera, framed by the painting behind. It's compelling and made all the more so for the painterly quality of the image - an effect, says Jane, that she deliberately aimed to achieve.

'I wanted to make them like the muses of Renaissance paintings,' she explains. 'To get the iconic feeling across by using 
similar lighting to the Renaissance masters, which I hope will get that point across.'

Despite the tragic circumstances of many of her models, Jane also hopes that people will find the images as beautiful as she does. 'I find them beautiful, even their imperfections,' she reveals. 'Some of the women are iconic to me.'

'I don't find [the photographs] hard to enjoy at all,' she adds. 'I still find these women mesmerising and I every time I look at them, I see something else I missed before.'
