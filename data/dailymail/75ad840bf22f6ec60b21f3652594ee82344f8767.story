It's seen as the Holy Grail of comedy, but Michael Palin has admitted most of Monty Python was 'c***'.

The comedian, broadcaster and travel writer claimed fans only remember the best bits of the legendary Python troupe's much-loved show and ignore the 'dross'.

Palin, while announcing his first solo tour of Britain, said his career had been sprinkled with 'lowlights and cock-ups'.

But he did say he had been lucky to have a selection of 'gleaming' sketches that people remember fondly, such as the Dead Parrot and the Spanish Inquisition.

The Pythons - John Cleese, Terry 
Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin - revealed in November
 they will launch a comeback this year.

Despite
 all being in their seventies with a combined age of 357 years, the 
group are getting back on stage together for the first time in 30 years at the O2 in July.

The Pythons had originally announced a one-off show at the O2 Arena but 
  tickets to that sold out in 43.5 seconds. A further nine dates were then 
  added, all of which have sold out.

Palin said at the London Book Fair he will follow it up with a one-man tour in the 
autumn, based on the soon-to-be published third volume of his diary, covering the years 1988 to 1998.

The
 21-venue tour, entitled Travelling to Work, will see Palin speak about 
his career, with anecdotes, photographs and footage 'looking back at 25 
years of exploring the world and nearly 50 years in radio, television, 
books and films'.

Cult comedy: The group's surreal TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus was first broadcast in 1969

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People forgive you the things that don’t work. A lot of Python was c***, it really was. We put stuff in there that was not really that good, but fortunately there were a couple of gleaming things that everyone remembers while they’ve forgotten the dross.

'I'm very proud of the things I've done,'
 he said. 'There are a lot of things looking back which you would say 
were brilliant, but it’s also about what's behind it and feeling of how 
you recover from things that didn't work so well.'

Palin said he will share anecdotes about the lesser-known parts of his career.

He will include his work on the 1994 West End play that 'got a right panning from critics' and the 1992 series Palin’s Column, in which he 'pottered around' the Isle of Wight before writing up his exploits for the local paper.

The Pythons' hugely successful, zany BBC TV series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, effectively threw away the rulebook of traditional sketch writing, dispensing with punchlines and allowing sketches to blend into each other or simply stop abruptly.

The first episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus was broadcast on 5 October, 1969.

It ran for four series and spawned spin-off records, books and even German-language specials.

Gilliam's unique animation style became a key element of the show, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas.

The comedy group made their successful film Monty Python and the Holy Grail on a small budget in between filming the third and fourth series of their TV show.

Their next film was the highly controversial Monty Python's Life Of Brian, released in 1979.

Telling the story of a man mistaken for Jesus, the film was attacked by Christian groups and banned in some areas.

Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life was released in 1983 and was another financial and critical success, winning the jury prize at Cannes film festival.

Palin's tour will begin on September 7 and run until October 22, with tickets on sale now.

John Cleese from the classic Monty Python sketch The Ministry of Funny/Silly Walks'

1. The Dead Parrot

Inspired by Michael Palin's trip to a mechanic who refused to accept there was a problem with his car, this is arguably the most famous Monty Python sketch.

Praline: It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot.

2. The Killer Joke

The sketch about a joke so funny, the man who wrote it laughs himself to death.

Inspector: I shall enter the house and attempt to remove the joke ... I shall be aided by the sound of sombre music, played on gramophone records, and also by the chanting of laments by the men of Q Division ... The atmosphere thus created should protect me in the eventuality of me reading the joke.

3. The Lumberjack Song

The catchy song by a cross-dressing woodcutter.

Barber: ‘I cut down trees, I skip and jump/ I like to press wild flowers/I put on women’s clothing/ And hang around in bars’

4. Hell's Grannies

A town is terrorised by gangs of marauding old ladies.

Policeman: We have a lot of trouble with these oldies. Pension day's the worst – they go mad. As soon as they get their hands on their money they blow it all on milk, bread, tea, tin of meat for the cat.

5. The Piranha Brothers

Current affairs programme 'Ethel the Frog' presents the story of ‘the notorious Piranha Brothers, who were clearly based on the Kray Twins.

Interviewer: I've been told Dinsdale Piranha nailed your head to the floor.

Stig: No. Never. He was a smashing bloke. He used to buy his mother flowers and that. He was like a brother to me.

Interviewer: But the police have film of Dinsdale actually nailing your head to the floor.

Stig:(pause) Oh yeah, he did that.

Interviewer: Why?

Stig: Well he had to, didn't he? I mean there was nothing else he could do, to be fair. I had transgressed the unwritten law.
