The Queen mingled with leading figures from Fleet Street yesterday as she  celebrated the 150th  anniversary of a charity that supports journalists and their families in need.

Newspaper editors, broadcasters and senior media executives chatted to the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh at Stationers' Hall in the City of London.

The event recognised the achievements of the Journalists' Charity, which has been helping journalists and their dependants since 1864 and has the Queen as patron.

The Queen helped celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Journalists' Charity at a reception in London - accompanied by its chairman, Laurie Upshon, she met editors and broadcasters at the Stationers' Hall

The Queen spoke to newspaper editors, columnists, sub-editors and television broadcasters at the event

Charles Dickens was one of the 
founders of the charity, which changed its name from the Newspaper Press
 Fund in 2005 to recognise the help it gives to journalists working 
across all parts of the media industry.

Among
 the guests were Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, Daniel Mulhall, 
Ireland's ambassador to the UK, and Daily Mail columnist Richard 
Littlejohn, who is an ambassador for the charity.

Laurie Upshon, the charity's chairman, said: 'The visit cements a connection that goes back 150 years.

'The
 Royal Family have been very good supporters of the charity since the 
very start, Queen Victoria actually donated £50 three times.'

The Duke of Edinburgh accompanied his wife to the 150th anniversary celebrations in the capital

The Queen left the event with the charity's chairman, Mr Upshon, while Prince Philip left with Lord Rothermere

Royal patronage: Lord and Lady Rothermere were among those who met the Queen at the Stationers' Hall

Mr
 Upshon said modern media developments interested the Queen. 'She was 
intrigued by the changes to the industry, the way there's online work 
now, changes to the print industry,' he said.

'She was intrigued young journalists are still taught shorthand.'

Lord
 Rothermere, the charity's president and chairman of Daily Mail and 
General Trust, which owns the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, 
presented the Queen with a bound copy of a speech delivered by her 
father exactly 84 years ago.

The
 address by George VI from 1930 came when he was the Duke of York and 
chairman of the charity's annual appeal dinner. In the speech he spoke 
of the strain facing journalists of the day.

'The
 high pressures at which reporters and subeditors, critics and leader 
writers work is probably greater than that demanded, at all events as a 
continuous effort, by any other profession,' he said.

'I
 know what difficulties the reporter has to meet. He is frequently 
working when the rest of mankind is playing or sleeping; he is out in 
all weathers trying to obtain stories which every one seems to be 
conspiring to keep from him.'
