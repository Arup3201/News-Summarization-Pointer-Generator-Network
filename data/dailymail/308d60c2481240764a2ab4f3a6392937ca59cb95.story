Crystal Palace will be in safe hands at the weekend when Keith Millen takes the helm once more.

Palace failed this week in their bid to replace Tony Pulis but have a reliable stop-gap in the 47-year-old, whose caretaker managerial experience shows a proven track record in a notoriously tricky role – helping Bristol City preserve Championship status in 2010 and aiding the Selhurst Park revival last term.

Malky Mackay had looked poised to take over at Palace but is now out of the running for the job following Sportsmail's revelations about the Scot and Iain Moody being accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic text messages during their time together at Cardiff.

Promising signs: Millen took charge of the narrow defeat by Arsenal on the opening day of the season

Millen took charge of the Eagles’ first match of the season as they went down fighting at the Emirates Stadium, Aaron Ramsey’s late goal securing a last-gasp 2-1 win for Arsenal.

And he’ll be continuing his fourth stint as an interim replacement in English football when he takes charge against West Ham on Saturday.

Millen first took on the role while he was assistant boss at Bristol City in 2005, after player-manager Brian Tinnion left the club, drawing and losing his two games before Gary Johnson was appointed.

Johnson led the club to promotion from League One to the Championship but it was left to Millen to save the club’s second-tier status when the manager left by mutual consent in 2010.

A draw against league leaders Newcastle in his first game impressed and five wins from their final nine games steered the Robins to safety.

Millen was awarded the role permanently at Ashton Gate after Steve Coppell left the role after just four months in charge at the beginning of the 2010-11 season.

He led City to a 15th place finish in the table and picked up his first manager of the month award after three wins in five in November.

However he left his position the following season after a poor start, which culminated in a 5-0 thrashing at Blackpool, before joining the Eagles as assistant in November 2012.

And he found himself back in the temporary hotseat last season after Ian Holloway’s departure, taking charge of four games, including a 0-0 draw at home to Everton and a 1-0 victory at Hull.
