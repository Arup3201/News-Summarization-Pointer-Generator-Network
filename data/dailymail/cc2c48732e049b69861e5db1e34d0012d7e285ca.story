A father-of-six oral surgeon and his 21-year-old assistant were killed after their SUV fell from a bridge and into an icy creek in Texas.

Robert Weinstein, 71, and Abigail Resendiz were identified as the two passengers who died in the accident at Mary's Creek in Tarrant County, which happened around 9.30pm on Saturday. 

The car's driver, an unidentified woman, was injured but able to free herself from the vehicle and call for help.

Robert Weinstein, 71, and Abigail Resendiz, 21, were killed after the SUV they were riding in hit an icy patch and flipped into Mary's Creek in Tarrant County, Texas at 9.30pm on Saturday 

Forth Worth Fire Department divers spent an hour trying to free Weinstein and Resendiz but  they were daunted by the freezing water, according to spokesman Lt. Michael Glynn. 

'Within four to five minutes, they're very cold and having trouble functioning and coordinating their efforts,' he said. 

Glynn said that the temperature and darkness were the 'worst possible scenario' the divers could have had and that it was 'incredibly difficult' for them to operate in the conditions. 

Diver teams had to rotate every five minutes, according to the Dallas Morning News. 

Resendiz was eventually freed from the car, but passed away in the hospital.

Firefighters had to use the jaws of life to free Weinstein from the vehicle. He died at the scene. 

Resendiz and Weinstein's cause of death was listed as drowning, with hypothermia and collision impact included as factors, according to WFAA-8.

Weinstein's brother Loren said Robert and his two staff members were returning from Odessa, where they travel to every month to help other oral surgeons with high demand in the area.

He said Robert's SUV hit a patch of ice on the way home and flipped into the creek. 

Glynn said Fort Worth police are still investigating what caused the accident but believe weather played a contributing factor.

Dr. Charles Chilcoat, who worked with both Weinstein and Resendiz, said he was shocked to learn about their deaths. 

Chilcoat said Weinstein was 'like a brother to him', who traveled the world with his wife and was a 'mentor to me and a good friend', he told NBC DFW 5. 

He said Resendiz was a 'good kid' who was always helping him remain upbeat and optimistic. 

'She'd say "come on Dr. Chilcoat, we just have one more patient, you can get through it."' 

'She was just 21 years old, and that's so sad.'
