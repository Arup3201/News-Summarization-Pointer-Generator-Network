CIA claims they foiled a terror attack on Heathrow and Canary Wharf using controversial ‘torture’ techniques were rejected by a highly critical US report published today.

The American spy agency said it had ‘saved lives’ by thwarting the planned 9/11-style attack on Britain’s busiest airport and business district.

But a long-delayed report, published by the Senate’s powerful Intelligence Committee, today roundly rejected claims that ‘enhanced interrogation’ of terror suspects had played any part in stopping attacks.

The report revealed CIA 'success stories' including 'dirty bomb' plotter Dhiren Barot and Saajid Badat, the co-conspirator of shoe-bomber Richard Reid, were untrue.

It also detailed the CIA torture techniques used on al-Qaeda suspects - including sleep deprivation for 180 hours in shackled, stress positions and waterboarding to the point of unconsciousness.

Its publication today has sparked a furious backlash in the US - with critics claiming it is naive and partisan in its criticism of the previous Bush administration.

The report could also fuel anti-Americanism - heightening the threat to the US and other allies including the UK.

The CIA immediately hit back at the report, insisting its interrogation programme was 'effective' and helped track down al Qaeda terrorists.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney said the techniques used were 'absolutely, totally justified.'

Today's report into torture techniques claimed 'Heathrow Airport and a building in Canary Wharf (pictured)' because they were 'powerful economic symbols'

But the report states: ‘The CIA represented that its enhanced interrogation techniques were effective and produced critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence, which thwarted plots and saved lives.

‘Over a period of years, the CIA provided the identification and thwarting of the Heathrow Airport Plot as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

‘These representations were inaccurate.’

The report insisted that the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plots ‘had not progressed beyond the initial planning stages’ and had already been disrupted.

It said 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had planned to attack the UK after his successful attack on New York.

The report said: ‘After the September 11, 2001, attacks against the United States, KSM sought to target the United Kingdom using hijacked aircraft and surmised that Heathrow Airport and a building in Canary Wharf, a major business district in London, were powerful economic symbols.

‘The initial plans for al-Qaeda operatives to hijack multiple airplanes departing Heathrow Airport, turn them around, and crash them into the airport itself.

‘Security was assessed to be too tight at Heathrow Airport and the plan was altered to focus on aircrafts departing from mainly Eastern European airports to conduct attacks against Heathrow Airport.

‘Al-Qaeda was unable to locate pilots to conduct these attacks.’

The report adds: ‘The thwarting of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plotting is one of the eight most frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

‘The CIA further represented that the intelligence acquired from the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was “otherwise unavailable” and “saved lives”.’

The report found that Barot's plot, which included limousines filled with explosives and 'dirty' bombs was actually thwarted after investigations by UK government authorities.

It also stated UK investigators, foreign intelligence services, international law enforcement efforts and the US military, rather than enhanced interrogation techniques, brought about the identification and arrest of Badat. 

The 500-page redacted report, which took years to complete, reveals details of the Central Intelligence Agency's 'Rendition, Detention and Interrogation' program, which President George W. Bush green-lighted after the 9/11 attacks.

The report covers the treatment of terror suspects rounded up by U.S. operatives between 2001 and 2009, after the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda which destroyed the World Trade Center in New York and damaged the Pentagon.

The report also revealed that the CIA misled the White House about the details and success of the program.

President Obama has already admitted that the US ‘tortured some folks’.

Since coming to office in 2009, President Obama has sought to distance the US from past deeds and outlawed harsh interrogation techniques which he has denounced as 'torture.'

The CIA's defenders insist the methods saved American lives by helping to uncover al-Qaeda's network, while critics say they ran contrary to U.S. values and hardened anti-American attitudes.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein delivered the damning indictment of CIA interrogation practices after the 9/11 attacks

Former Bush vice president Dick Cheney staunchly defended the interrogation program, telling the New York Times it was 'absolutely, totally justified'.

He denied the CIA withheld any information, and emphasized the program had been vetted by the Justice Department.

'As far as I'm concerned, they ought to be decorated, not criticized,' he said of the CIA interrogators.

'When we had that program in place, we kept the country safe from any more mass casualty attacks, which was our objective,' he said.

Even though the redacted paper will reportedly absolve Bush and his White House of knowledge to the extent of which the CIA allowed terrorism suspects to be tortured in Europe and Asia in the wake of 9/11, Bush has openly opposed the release of the document.

'We’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,' he told CNN’s Candy Crowley during an interview that aired on Sunday.

'These are patriots. And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base,' he continued, calling the CIA operatives and directors about to be chastised 'really good people'.

The 6,200-page report was prepared by the US Senate intelligence committee.

The investigation began in 2009 and took three years to complete. The full report is 6,200 pages and has 35,000 footnotes. After negotiations over security concerns, this was reduced to 500 pages with redactions
