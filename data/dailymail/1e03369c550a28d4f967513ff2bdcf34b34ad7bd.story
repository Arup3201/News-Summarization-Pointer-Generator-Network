Gruesome details emerged today that allegedly show how the naked body of American socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack was stuffed into a suitcase and was then caught on security footage being carried to a taxi by one of her suspected killers.

Outlining the case against the widow's pregnant daughter Heather Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, police said the evidence was 'overwhelming.'

They say the 62-year-old was folded into the silver-coloured case, with her back arched forward at an almost impossible angle and her legs bent up around the sides of her head.

But because she had been lowered into the 3ft-long suitcase on her side, the lid would not close completely over the body of the murdered 5ft 5in woman.

In a panic, her alleged killers wrapped the suitcase in a sheet and pulled the cloth tight around it in the hope that it would disguise the fact that it was not closed.

The allegations emerged as a police commander agreed the couple had rejected KFC when it was sent in 
to them at their separate police station cells - he is in Denpasar and 
she is in South Kuta - but said police did not intend to insult them 
with food that black people would reject on cultural grounds.

'They
 are Americans. We thought we would give them some American food and 
they would be grateful,' said the Commander Djoko Hariutomo. 'So today they are eating 
rice-based local food.'

Police sources in Bali revealed that, contrary to earlier reports, the murder had occurred in room 317 - not 616 - which was being shared by Mrs Mack and her daughter at the luxury beachside St Regis Hotel in the upmarket Nusa Dua region of the holiday island.

Mack's boyfriend was staying in room 616
 - and it was from that room, in the early hours of Tuesday, August 12, 
that Schaefer, dressed in dark clothing, was seen on the hotel’s 
security cameras stepping out into the corridor and taking the lift down
 to the third floor.

The alleged killers - her 19-year-old pregnant daughter Heather Mack and the teenager's 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer - wrapped the suitcase in a sheet to disguise the fact that it was not closed, police say

He entered room 317 - it is not known if he knocked or whether he had access to the keycard - but some time later he is seen later allegedly lugging the suitcase on his shoulder as he steps out of the room.

He decides not to take the lift - perhaps because he might meet other guests - and makes his way up the stairs to his own room. 

But in his haste, he made an error and found himself on the seventh floor and had to make his way back down one floor, police claim.

Police who have studied the security camera sequences have noted that Schaefer was totally alone in the stairway, but it has not been revealed what time of the early morning he was moving between the third and sixth floors.

He is then believed to have packed his own belongings and changed his clothes, including putting on a red and yellow jacket, before asking a bell boy to come up collect the luggage on a trolley.

Security footage shows the bell boy 
walking a luggage trolly through the plush lobby, the sheet-covered 
suitcase lying under other bags.

Schaefer
 walks beside the trolley and it is he who lifts the case into the boot 
of a waiting taxi before returning to the hotel with his girlfriend.

At
 that stage, no-one appears to have noticed anything wrong, but when 
Schaefer and his girlfriend fail to come back out the taxi driver 
strolls around to the boot and notices blood.

Security
 officials tell him to drive immediately to the main police headquarters
 in the area, in South Kuta, where stunned officers discover the 
American woman's body, head and hair covered in blood, when they open 
the suitcase.

Mrs Mack was found lying on her left side, her blonde hair covering most of the right side of her face.She apparently died when blood blocked her airways after her face had been neaten so hard. 

Brute strength appears to have been required to 'fold' Mrs Mack into the suitcase, police said.

Police
 are expected to produce court photographs of the savage injuries Mrs 
Mack received to her face, which appears to have sustained a number of 
heavy blows.

Despite police
 sources stating earlier that she had been hit with a glass ashtray, the
 object was described today as looking like an ashtray but which was 
more 'ornamental'.

At South Kuta
 police headquarters today, Commander Djoko Hariutomo, said the evidence
 of murder against Mack and Schaefer was 'overwhelming' - and he 
cited one good reason for it.

If
 the murder had occurred in a cheaper hotel, which does not have such a 
sophisticated security system, the police, he admitted would not have a 
step-by-step replay of a murder.

He
 insisted that the actual footage from the security cameras and still 
photographs taken from the security sequences were 'off the record' and 
would not be made public until the murder case gets under way through 
the courts.

'We have the 
movements of all three parties in the public areas of the hotel - 
including the stairways - from the second they checked in on separate 
days,' he said in a reference to the mother and daughter arriving two 
days before Schaefer.

Accused:
 Mack (pictured) has told her lawyer that she has been sexually 
assaulted 'multiple times' behind bars. Michael Elkin said she was 
unsure whether it was allegedly at the hands of prison guards or inmates

There
 is evidence, as MailOnline has previously reported, of the mother and 
daughter arguing over who should pay for Schaefer's room, number 616, 
and there is the floor-by-floor playback of the man hoisting the 
suitcase from the murder room to his own.

Commander
 Djoko, who appeared to leave little doubt about his confidence that the
 case against Mack and her boyfriend is watertight, said: 'The evidence,
 put together from fingerprints, security footage, the behaviour of the 
suspects, all lead us to believe we have the right people in custody.'

Mack
 and her boyfriend are likely to be in custody for many weeks before 
they are brought to court and formally charged, said Commander Djoko. 

The
 pair are then expected to be moved to the notorious Kerobokan prison as
 they are taken through the laborious Indonesian justice system. 

Along
 the way, Mack, who is nearly two months pregnant, will probably give birth to 
her baby while in custody and the question will then arise as to whether
 the child should be placed in the care of relatives or friends in the 
U.S.

Asked about 
suggestions that an alleged crime pending against one or both of the 
couple in the U.S. could result in them being extradited to be dealt 
with there first, Commander Djoko shook his head.

'We aren’t taking that into consideration. They are under arrest here. This is our case. They will be dealt with here.'

Aside
 from security camera footage that allegedly implicates the two 
Americans in Mrs Mack’s murder, Commander Djoko said police have taken 
statements from 16 witnesses. 

'And that’s so far,' he said.

The
 pair, who have not been charged, continue to refuse to talk to investigating officers, insisting on
 a lawyer travelling from the U.S. to replace the police lawyer who has 
been designated to liaise with them, although it is understood she is 
not getting far with them.

Mack
 has complained to a U.S. Attorney who reached her by phone that she has
 been physically and sexually assaulted, a complaint that Commander 
Djoko brushed aside as being 'completely untrue'.

The 19-year-old 
is not sure whether it was fellow inmates or guards who molested her, 
her Chicago attorney Michael Elkin told MailOnline. 'It is very 
disconcerting,' he said.

'She initially thought it was fellow inmates, but now she has discovered that not all the guards are wearing official uniforms.'

There
 is nothing else for the pair to do, said the commander. They glance through a newspaper but
 otherwise, said the commander, they have no other form of 
entertainment.

Police claim the couple initially told them that they been taken captive at the St. Regis by an armed gang who killed Mrs Mack. 

They said they managed to escape the gang’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the Kuta area of Bali.
