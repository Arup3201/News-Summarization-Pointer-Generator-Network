A paralysed former Royal Marine was left without a vital phone system used to keep him alive - after phone supplier TalkTalk cut him off for a whole week.

Dominic Lovett, paralysed four years ago, relies solely on a specialist alarm system which works through a phone connection to his live-in assistant in Horrabridge, Devon.

The connection is vital so the former signaller can raise the alarm should he have any problems or even suffer a life-threatening stroke.

CUt off: The ex-Marine has been disconnected for almost a week, meaning he would be in serious danger if he suffered a stroke

But the former Marine's life was put at risk when TalkTalk left him disconnected for almost a week.

Mr Lovett, 24, was cut off when he changed suppliers from BT earlier this month.

Proud: Mr Lovett before his paralysis, which happened in 2008

He has been without the vital phone system since Friday, with TalkTalk informing him it would be another fortnight before the problem could be fixed, despite him telling them he could die if it wasn’t sorted.

Mr Lovett said: 'I need my phone line for my alarm and when I called Talk Talk I explained I need a phone for my health and they were not willing to help at all.

'I told them I could die as a result and they told me I would still have to wait two weeks.

'This is why I have the alarm system. I cannot wait - one day is long enough but to wait ten days or two weeks I cannot do it.'

In 2008 Plymouth commando, Mr Lovett was deployed to Norway on an Arctic warfare training exercise.

But after completing the final test, he went out to celebrate with his friends and was left paralysed after jumping into a shallow pile of snow - with solid ice underneath.

He suffered an injury to his spine leaving him paralysed. His only life-line was his specialist alarm system.

But when he switched providers from BT to Talk Talk, he found he had not been connected as promised.

It took five days for an engineer to visit his home, in Horrabridge, Devon, on Tuesday.

But he said the connection still wasn’t right and would only work for five minutes before breaking off.

Mr
Lovett said: 'It’s just completely severed my independence - well what 
was left of it and to me a large company not even trying to accommodate 
me made me think twice who I will go with.

'They were completely unwilling to budge trying to accommodate a disabled person.

'I don’t know what they would do if this was someone who was more severely disabled and couldn’t voice their issues.'

Talk Talk said another engineer would visit him again to restore a full service as soon as possible.

A
Talk Talk spokesperson said: 'We are sorry that, because of a fault, Mr
Lovett has been without a phone line since Friday and we have 
apologised to Mr Lovett.

'An engineer visited on Tuesday evening and restored a full service.

'We’re
committed to providing good service and great value phone and broadband
to all of our customers and will ensure that we learn from this 
instance where we could have served the customer better.'
