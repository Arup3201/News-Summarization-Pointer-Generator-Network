Former German concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, where more than 70,000 Jews died at the hands of the Nazis, says it is struggling to meet the demand of visitors to the historic site.

Following calls from the President of the Jewish Council to make visits to concentration camp memorials compulsory for school children over 15, the caretakers of Bergen-Belsen near Hanover said it's already at capacity with the 300,000 people who visit annually. 

'We get around 1,000 group visits a year, and around half are school classes,' spokeswoman for the museum, Stephanie Billib, told The Local.

'We have to turn a lot away because we don't have the capacity to accompany them all.'

As the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland is marked on Tuesday, awareness is far from waning from younger generations not just from Germany but around the world - in particular countries that formed the Allied Forces against Hitler. 

Jewish Council head Josef Schuster told German newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that it was one thing to teach about the horrors of the past but another to give young people the chance connect personally with the sites at which they took place.

'Germany's commemoration culture has developed positively in the last 20 years,' he said. 'There are only a few of the perpetrators' generation left and young people speak more freely about this topic.'

Tuesday, January 27, is also Holocaust Memorial Day bringing further attention to the incidents of the past. 

Bergen-Belsen is turning to technology in a bid to solve its overcrowding problem and trialling an iPad app that could work in place of human guides who they are already struggling to pay to run tours.

Visitors to former Nazi concentration camps have been on the rise in recent years, with Auschwitz alone rising from one million in 2006 from 94 countries to 1.43m in 2012.

On Tuesday, about 300 Auschwitz survivors and a number of heads of state from Allied nations gathered at the site of the camp in formerly German-occupied Poland to commemorate 70 years since it was liberated by Soviet forces in 1945.

More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were executed in gas chambers or by guards or died from starvation and disease at the camps between 1940 and 1945. 

Norbert Lammert, Germany's President of the Bundestag (speaker of the lower house), stressed the importance of his country and the world ensuring the atrocities of the Holocaust are not forgotten. 

'Later generations aren't responsible for the horrific past of our country,' Lammert concluded.

'But they do answer for how we deal with it.'
