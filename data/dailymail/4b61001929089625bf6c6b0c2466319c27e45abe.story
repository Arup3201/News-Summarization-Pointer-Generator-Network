Nearly five million people will be trapped in the 40p tax band by next year, a think-tank said yesterday.

Two million of them will have been sucked in since the last election, 1.4million more than would have been affected under Labour’s plans, it said.

Those caught by George Osborne’s failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £546 worse off next year, according to the respected  Institute for Fiscal Studies.

But the Chancellor’s changes to Labour’s plans for the 40p rate, once reserved for the wealthiest in society, mean the Treasury has raked in an extra £3.6billion.

If Labour’s plans had been adhered to by Mr Osborne, people would have begun to pay the 40p tax rate if they earned £47,845 in 2015/16.

But the Chancellor’s curbs on raising the threshold means the tax rate will kick in at an income of £42,285 – a difference of £5,560.

Doubts: Gemma Tetlow

George Osborne was yesterday accused of fudging his figures amid warnings that Britain faces even deeper spending cuts after the General Election.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies raised questions over how the Treasury plans to pay for nearly £5billion of giveaways outlined in the Budget.

The respected watchdog also warned that Britain is not even half way through the cuts required to balance the books.

In his Budget speech on Wednesday, Mr Osborne boasted that unlike under previous governments his figures ‘are not fiddled but fair and independent’ as they are audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

But the IFS said it was not clear how he would pay for £4.9billion of giveaways such as the increase in the personal allowance to £10,500 and tax cuts for savers.

‘The Chancellor is getting into bad habits,’ said IFS researcher Gemma Tetlow, adding: ‘Permanent giveaways are being paid for by unspecified spending cuts and temporary increases in tax revenues. And he is announcing spending commitments but with no means to pay for them.’

In total there will be just under five million higher-rate taxpayers in 2015/16, according to the IFS, up from three million in 2010 and 4.4 million today.

That figure is 200,000 higher than recent estimates, suggesting the problem is even worse than Tory MPs had feared when they called on Mr Osborne to raise the 40p threshold in the Budget – demands he rejected.

Another 350,000 people earning more than £150,000 a year will be paying the top rate of 45p, bringing the number of people paying a  tax rate of 40p or higher to 5.3 million in 2015.

David Phillips, senior research economist at the IFS, said: ‘Our best estimate of how much it would cost to increase the higher-rate threshold to £47,845 is £3.6 billion a year.

‘This would then leave most higher-rate taxpayers £546.04 better off in 2015/16 than under the plans inherited from Labour.’

The 2 million people who are being sucked into paying the higher rate – those earning between £42,285 and £47,845 – will be worse off as they are paying 40p income tax and 2p National Insurance rather than 20p income tax and 12p NI on the difference. Someone on £43,285 will be £100 worse off, someone on £47,285 is £500 worse off.

Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) think-tank, said: ‘Under George Osborne, nearly 1.5 million more  taxpayers are paying this rate. This  is an attack on aspiration and entrepreneurship.’

When David Cameron came to power, the difference between the starting salary for 40p tax and the country’s average full-time salary was £18,000. But research published by the Taxpayers’ Alliance says this gap has narrowed to just £14,400 today, a sign of how more modest earners are being trapped.

Rather than being a tax on the wealthy, it has become a tax paid by ordinary workers from teachers to nurses, middle managers to Tube drivers.

For married couples, the impact of becoming a higher-rate taxpayer is a double blow because they will also lose their married couples’ allowance. From April 2015, couples will be able to transfer £1,050 of their tax-free personal allowance to each other – but only if neither is a higher-rate taxpayer. Mike Warburton, a director at the accountants Grant Thornton, said: ‘We are now witnessing a groundswell from many hard-working families, who do not consider themselves rich, that enough is enough.

‘It is important that 40 per cent tax does not become the accepted norm for such families by default.’
