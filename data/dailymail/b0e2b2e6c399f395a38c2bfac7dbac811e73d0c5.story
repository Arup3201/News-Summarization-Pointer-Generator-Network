Sam Burgess will be unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday, and the man tipped to become ‘the greatest rugby star on the planet’ will speak about his decision to switch codes in a bid for World Cup glory.

The 25-year-old will hold a press conference at the Recreation Ground less than a month after guiding the South Sydney Rabbitohs to a historic NRL Grand Final victory, which saw him shatter his eye socket in the first minute but go on to earn the man-of-the-match award and, with it, a place in league folklore.

The man they call ‘Slammin Sam’ needed five metal plates inserted to reconstruct his face following the dramatic triumph over Canterbury Bulldogs.

The surgery forced him to delay his return from Australia but enabled him to collect the international rugby league player of the year award in person; becoming the first Englishman ever to do so.

The former Bradford Bull was lured to Bath by a big-money offer and the prospect of following in the footsteps of Jason Robinson — the only Englishman to switch codes and win the union World Cup. 

With less than a year to prove himself ahead of next September’s global tournament many doubt the 18-stone former loose forward — being lined up to play inside centre — can make the transition in time. His tackling technique, in particular, is likely to be heavily scrutinized. Robinson is not among the doubters.

‘It took me three months after my switch to play for England and get on a Lions tour and I’ve no doubt Sam can do the same,’ said the 2003 World Cup winner and former Wigan great.

‘He’s already got the title as the best player in rugby league and has all the ingredients to do the same in rugby union. I think Sam will play in the World Cup. I certainly think he can be the best-ever cross-code player.’

‘Well, I’ve arrived in bath and been for a look around. What a wonderful town. Quite jet lagged now but powering on. What Restraunt tonight??.’

The RFU insist they played no part in Burgess’s switch but Stuart Lancaster — a huge admirer of league — is clearly excited by the prospect of working with such a talent. England’s midfield is still not settled, with injury and lack of form hampering Lancaster’s attempts to forge a tried and trusted partnership. Burgess could yet be the answer to his prayers.

‘Having spoken to him, his mind-set obviously is to make the World Cup squad,’ Lancaster said.

‘We have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn quickly, but he’s mentally strong. If he can learn the game he’ll bring an invaluable amount to the group. He is a very, very good player and an impressive person.

‘What stands out for me is his mental toughness and strength, the desire to dominate his opposite number. It will be fascinating to see how he goes.’

Those who have worked with Burgess speak of an intensely competitive individual, even by the standards of professional rugby, with an almost superhuman capacity to absorb pain and a relentless work ethic which drives others around him.

New Zealand-born actor and Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe — who signed him from Bradford Bulls in 2010 — described Burgess as his ‘sparkly-eyed man’. Without doubt, Burgess is a leader of men.

The death of his father, former professional league player Mark, at the age of 44 is said to have had a profound effect on Sam, along with his three younger brothers, who he has left behind at the Rabbitohs to forge a new career in union.

‘Sam has made himself a legend in rugby league,’ said Bath owner Bruce Craig, a key player in the deal to bring Burgess to the Rec.

‘It was absolutely extraordinary that he was able to play 79 minutes with a broken cheek bone and be man-of-the-match as well. He is a warrior who is going to create huge interest in the English game. It can only be good for rugby.’

His arrival is set to attract unprecedented attention on Bath — an upwardly mobile club with a great history and an increasingly rosy future.

On Tuesday, Wallaby scrum-half Will Genia indicated his interest in joining Burgess at Bath. ‘Obviously the chance to possibly play with someone as special a player like that is definitely appealing,’ Genia said.

‘You saw the type of character he was in that NRL grand final. You always want to play with guys who are inspirational and make such an impact.’

But what do those already at the Rec think of his pending arrival?

‘When (Bath coach) Mike Ford spoke to me about signing him the first thing he mentioned was his character,’ said Bath captain Stuart Hooper. ‘He felt he would fit into our Bath system. I’m excited about welcoming him and helping him learn our sport and ultimately become a very successful rugby union player. I don’t think there’s a danger of his arrival disrupting us. We’ve got numerous people who could be involved with England through to the World Cup.

‘If everything goes to plan and England win they will all be superstars. We’re aware of this. You have to deal with it. It’s part and parcel of wanting to become a great club.’

Of course, a pocket of union diehards will dismiss Burgess’s chances out of hand. Time is against him and history suggests more converts fail than succeed.

But such was his league stature, and such is England’s desire for him to make the grade, it would be folly to write off his chances of making the World Cup; despite the inconvenience of a depressed fracture of his cheek delaying his start until the turn of the year.

His brutish carrying, sublime off-loading and incredible work-rate has drawn comparisons with Sonny Bill Williams, who switched codes at short notice and became an All Black World Cup winner in 2011. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Burgess leapfrogs Brad Barritt, Billy Twelvetrees and Kyle Eastmond to claim the England No12 jersey.

‘He won’t take much bedding in because his size and the threat he poses in league make him a completely different kettle of fish,’ said another successful cross-coder, Saracens and England winger Chris Ashton.

‘Sam’s an exception. If you watch him play league, he’s the best player on the pitch every single time. There aren’t many players like that — he’s up there with Sonny Bill Williams.’

Time will tell. But whatever Burgess achieves in union, and however long he sticks around, the mark he has left in Australia, where league is king, is indelible.

‘People talk about Sam becoming the greatest English forward to ever come to Australia,’ said Rabittohs chief executive Shane Richardson. ‘The reality is he could be one of the greatest forwards to have ever played the game.’

Burgess has a new game to play now. Buckle up. It’s going to be some ride.
