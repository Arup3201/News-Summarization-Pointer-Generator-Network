Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale has heaped praise on team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, admitting that the Portuguese star is inspiring him to try and become the best player in the world.

Bale, who netted Real's opening goal in their 5-1 win against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday, has settled into life at the Bernabeu quickly, establishing himself in Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded first-team.

But the winger, who has flown to Wales to join up with Chris Coleman's squad, says he hopes to develop further and challenge for the Ballon d'Or, an award he believes Ronaldo is likely to retain after another year of dazzling performances.

Speaking to BBC show Football Focus, Bale said: 'I think Cristiano has been amazing this season. 

'The amount of goals he's scored, he won the Champions League with us, and he's been playing fantastic. I can't see many people past him (for the Ballon d'Or) but I'm looking forward to seeing who wins and good luck to everybody.'

As well as the chance to play for arguably the world's biggest club, Bale admits that the opportunity to line up alongside talented players like the former Manchester United forward was another key factor in his decision to leave Tottenham in the summer of 2013.

He added: 'It's another reason why I came to Madrid - to learn from the best players. Seeing him (Ronaldo) in training every day, how concentrated he is on every aspect of his game and on the pitch.

'The amount of goals he's scored and what he does for the team is incredible. Nobody is living up to that at the moment.'

Although Bale made the 23-man shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or, the 25-year-old knows he still has work to do if he is to be considered on the same level as Ronaldo.

Asked whether he had the ambition to be crowned the best player in the world, the ex-Spurs man said: 'If you don't think that, you shouldn't really be playing football. You obviously want to win those type of trophies. It shows you're doing well.

'The main thing for me is I'm improving all the time. If I see him (Ronaldo) in training and games, it gives me that platform to aim for and hopefully I can get there.'
