Mario Balotelli arrived at Liverpool last summer as a young man perceived to be entering the last-chance saloon, but on the back of a scoring record at Milan that would make him one of the hottest strikers in the current Premier League season, if replicated. Contradictory? Absolutely. 

But therein lies the enigma of Balotelli, who has held immense promise but a matching capacity to be distracted ever since Roberto Mancini bought him for Inter Milan from Lumezzane as a young teenager almost eight years ago. 

But having finally scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, and crucially the winner, in Tuesday night’s 3-2 win over Tottenham, he will deliver at Anfield, eventually. That at least is his recurring promise and although with Balotelli the ride is never smooth, there are real signs that he won back the faith of his manager Brendan Rodgers, is gelling with his team-mates - and that he wants to show the fans he is worth the £16million fee and £5m-a-year in wages.

Mario Balotelli fires home the winner for Liverpool as they edge out Tottenham at Anfield on Tuesday

Balotelli's goal was his first in the Premier League for Liverpool having arrived last summer from AC Milan

Balotelli was immediately mobbed by his team-mates as Liverpool moved to within a point of Tottenham

The Italian striker did not raise a smile however, despite helping Liverpool close in on the top four 

As he said with a mixture of bite and humility in a grinning Instagram post after the Spurs win: 'This smile is ONLY for those that always believe and support me. Thank you and forza Liverpool. But now head down and keep working hard. Tonight is past.' 

Certainly his league goal drought for Liverpool is in the past, his vital strike against Spurs taking his club tally to three now, after a Champions League goal over Ludogorets in September and a Capital One Cup win against Swansea the following month.

But then goals have generally not been a big problem in his career, when he’s had periods of stability. Statistics alone never tell the whole story and that’s especially true with Balotelli. 

But the hard numbers show he has got better with age, despite the many, many hiccups, be they fireworks, bib troubles, bust-ups with team-mates and managers, failed Hollywood back-heels, social media gaffes, and on and on. 

Between 17 and 20 at Inter, he scored 20 league goals in 59 games for a hit rate of  34 per cent.

At Manchester City, where he was generally accepted as a maddening flop, his rate of 20 goals in 54 Premier League games actually rose to 37 per cent.

Balotelli opened his account for Liverpool against Ludogorets in September and now has three goals

Balotelli has consistently posted pictures and messages alluding to his love of the club and his team-mates

And in 18 months in Milan from early 2013 to last summer, he scored 26 league goals in 43 games, a strike rate of more than 60 per cent. 

The only players doing better in the current Premier League season are Diego Costa (17 in 19 for 89 per cent), Sergio Aguero (14 in 19, 74 per cent), Charlie Austin (13 in 19, 68 per cent) and Harry Kane (13 in 21, 62 per cent). 

You want something counter-intuitive? Balotelli arrived at Anfield in the form of the current Harry Kane, but with several tons of baggage. The hope for everyone at Liverpool is he now comes good; the evidence is that as his confidence grows, he feels - and demonstrates, principally via social media - part of the unit.

When he’s not watching Peppa Pig with his two-year-old daughter, Pia, his posts of himself with his team-mates or of his team-mates have come on his ‘good’ days. The day he scored against Ludogorets he posted pictures of Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling. The away win at Sunderland when he was a substitute was a team shot inside the dressing room captioned ‘Oh yes.’ 

Last month as his only involvement in one of the League Cup ties with Chelsea was watching it on his telly, he posted a photograph of himself doing so. The caption read: ‘This illness might prevent me from helping my team on the pitch but it will NOT stop me from supporting my team off the pitch!! come on guys.’ 

And then two days later, he posted a picture of himself with Daniel Sturridge. ‘Can’t wait,’ he said, obviously referring to their potential partnership. Rodgers then knocked him back by dropping him for the FA Cup tie at home to Bolton, but also made it clear there was a way back with hard work. 

'I think we have shown here a number of times with players that have been out of the fold, for various reasons, that if they work hard in training, show the intensity and show the focus then they have every chance of getting back in the team - and not only getting back in it but staying in it,’ he said. ‘The opportunity is there for Mario, and for every player - not just him.’ 

Balotelli has been supported by manager Brendan Rodgers despite struggling to make an impression

Balotelli posted the message: 'The time will come when everyone will get what they deserve' on Instagram

He made it back. The comeback win over Bolton in the replay was followed by more convivial footage with team-mates: Sterling, Sturridge and Jordan Ibe, all dancing at the Melwood training ground with Balotelli joining in.

Balotelli has been promising since October he would come good, since fans displayed a banner saying he had nothing to declare but his genius. ‘Wow thanks to whoever did this,’ he said then. ‘I know all of you expect more from me... More goals especially and more genius but give me time and I'll show is true.’

Then just last week, in Italian, he posted a new quote: ‘Arriverà il momento dove ognuno avrà quel che si merita' (‘The time will come when everyone will get what they deserve').

He clearly expects to come good.
