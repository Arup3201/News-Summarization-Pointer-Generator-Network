By far the most captivating character in the far-flung saga of California state senator turned accused arms trafficker Leland Yee is the flashy suit wearing, mustachioed 'reformed' San Francisco crime boss Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow.

The beloved Yee's arrest shocked residents throughout a community that largely adored him Wednesday, but the flashy suit and mustache sporting Chow's was simply another twist in his life's tale of ruthless crime and redemption.

But just how much of a twist remains a source of debate. While the FBI's exhaustive report on his crimes call Chow the Dragonhead leader of a fearsome triad, local authorities think his days of power have long ago devolved to a life of petty crime.

Holding court: Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow is perhaps the most colorful character among those arrested Wednesday as part of a wide snaring of San Francisco Chinese mafia figures that included a beloved state politician

According to the FBI's 137-page complaint made public Wednesday, Chow is the leader - the dragonhead - of one of the most powerful Asian gangs in North America, one that stretches out from San Francisco to the shores of Hong Kong and mainland China.

They say Chow's gang lured state Sen. Leland Yee into its clutches through money and campaign contributions in exchange for legislative help, as Yee sought to rebuild his campaign coffers to run for California secretary of state.

Checkered history: Chow has been in and out of prison since arriving to California from Hong Kong in 1976. He was by most accounts a brutal enforcer for a fearsome San Francisco-based triad. But the 54-year-old has claimed to have gone legit since serving out his last stint in 2003

Born in Hong Kong in 1960, Chow came to the United States at 16 and was reportedly nicknamed 'Shrimp Boy' by his grandmother, in part due to his small stature.

After dropping out of high school, Chow rose within the ranks of the local Hop Sing Tong gang and became the hired muscle who shook down illegal gambling parlors in the narrow alleyways of the nation's oldest Chinatown.

His star rose even higher after he and his crew survived an infamous 1977 shooting at a Chinatown restaurant that left five dead and about a dozen people injured.

Chow then spent a few years inside San Quentin Prison for a robbery conviction, and after his release, he started working with the Hong Kong-based Wo Hop To triad, one of numerous Chinese underground societies linked to organized crime. Chow has admitted that as a gang leader, he ran prostitution rings, smuggled drugs and extorted thousands of dollars from business owners in the 1980s.

'He was given like an unofficial position of being a leader, but to say he was sophisticated, no. He was more like a forceful brute,' said Ignatius Chinn, a former California Department of

Justice agent who spent years investigating Chow in the early 1990s. 'If he didn't get his way, he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him.'

Prominent figures: The 5-foot-5 and forever smiling Chow is seen her with then-Mayor Gavin Newsom. He began appearing at events for at risk youth where he urged them, sometimes to the applause of figures like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, to stay away from gang life

Crime boss? The FBI says their investigation revealed Chow was the revered Dragonhead of an international crime syndicate the entire time he was touting his own story of redemption

Although he ultimately was convicted of gun charges and sentenced to 25 years to life in the 1990s, Chow cut a deal to win release and returned Chinatown several years ago, pledging to stay straight. His work with at-risk youth soon won accolades from prominent politicians including former city mayor Gavin Newsome and U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein.

That's when Chow's own political star had begun rising. Around 2008, he began meeting with at-risk youth to talk with kids about how to stay on the straight and narrow said Rudy Corpuz Jr., executive director of the youth-led violence prevention organization United Playaz.

'He wasn't just the average guy on the street corner when he had that life, he was somebody you wouldn't mess with. And he's little so people were like, "Damn, that little guy had that much power?"' said Corpuz Jr., who said Chow's redemption story helped change hundreds of young lives for the good.

In 2009, Chow summed up his journey toward redemption in a press conference at San Francisco City Hall.

'All the criminal past I had, I cannot deny that,' he said through his ever-present grin. 'But today I do not represent crime. I do not represent violence and gangs.'Â 

The many faces of Shrimp Boy: While authorities 
never believed he'd cleaned up his act, California investigators are 
slow to believe the FBI's blanket assertion that Chow was a full fledged
 Chinatown crime boss

'He was given like an unofficial position of being a leader, but to say he was sophisticated, no. He was more like a forceful brute,' said Ignatius Chinn, a former California Department of Justice agent who spent years investigating Chow in the early 1990s. 'If he didn't get his way, he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him.'

While the local authorities never believed claims Chow had cleaned himself up, Chinn told the LA Times that his other claims--of his vaunted status within his international crime operation--were no more based in reality.

'The local gangsters have a saying: 'Follow the shrimp if you don't want to eat,' Chinn told the LA Times.

The complaint alleges that Chow used his position as the dragonhead of the Ghee Kung Tong to launder money, receive and transport stolen property and traffic in contraband cigarettes during a FBI sting.

Several years ago, undercover FBI 
agents assigned to Chow infiltrated the organization, and ultimately 
snared Yee and his campaign consultant Keith Jackson along with two 
dozen others, including Chow.

The
 three were arrested Wednesday during a series of raids in Sacramento 
and the San Francisco Bay Area that also netted additional members of 
the tong.

Yee, free on $500,000 bail, withdrew Thursday from the race for secretary of state.

Chow was denied bail because he was deemed a flight risk and a danger to the public. Jackson was denied bail, too.

Shocking: Investigations into Chow's activities, at least in part, helped lead authorities to California state senator Leland Yee, who was arrested Wednesday on charged of corruption and for allegedly offering to introduce an undercover agent to Muslim separatist arms dealers
