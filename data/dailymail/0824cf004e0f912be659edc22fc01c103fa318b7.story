More charges? Wearing a tight fitting black pencil dress with four inch Christian Louboutin heels the weary-looking Rebekah Brooks arrived at Southwark Crown Court for the first hearing

They were once the king and princess of a blossoming media empire.

But the lives of Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks now couldn't have appeared further apart.

While she appeared in court charged with perverting the course of justice today, the News Corp mogul appeared without a care in the world as he soaked up the sun aboard a gondola on a family holiday in Venice last week.

Wearing a tight-fitting black pencil dress with four-inch Christian Louboutin heels, the 44-year old looked weary as she arrived at Southwark Crown Court with husband Charlie to be told she may be charged with further offences in relation to Scotland Yard's probe into phone hacking.

But for the global media mogul, who is now in New York, the plight of his flame-haired former protegee appeared but a distant memory as he relaxed 1,000 miles away on his family holiday.

He strolled the sun-drenched Venetian canal walks, laughing with wife Wendi Deng and their young daughters, Grace Helen, 11, and nine-year-old Chloe.

They even had time to relax on his £190,000 Rosehearty superyacht in the crystal waters of the Mediterranean Sea.

Back in London, Mrs Brooks sat stoney faced with Charlie and their four co-defendants.

A trial date for the allegations that she hid documents and computers from detectives investigating hacking and bribing public officials was not set after the court heard that she is due to learn if she is to be charged with further offences in relation to the Met's Operation Weeting.

Brooks, her husband Charlie and four of her former entourage are now not expected to indicate their pleas until September after she answers bail to hear her fate in relation to the other allegations.

The 44-year-old listened intently as the dates for the case against her were set down in the courtroom packed with journalists'.

Simple life: More than 1,000 miles away, her former boss and trusted mentor Rupert Murdoch appeared without a care in the world as he soaked up the sun aboard a gondola on a family holiday in Venice last weekend

Rebekah who? For the global media mogul, the plight of his flame-haired former protegee appeared but a distant memory as he strolled the sun-drenched Venetian canal walks laughing with wife Wendi Deng and their young daughters

She appeared at Southwark Crown Court 
today alongside her racehorse trainer husband, 49, her former PA Cheryl 
Carter, 48, News Internationals Head of Security Mark Hanna, 49, her 
ex-chauffeur Paul Edwards, 48, security consultant Daryl Jorsling, 39. 
They are the first to face court over the hacking scandal.

Brooks
schemed to remove boxes of archive records from the Murdoch company 
headquarters, concealed material and hid documents, computers and other 
electronic equipment from detectives investigating both phone hacking 
and the bribery of public officials, it is claimed.

She faces three charges of perverting the course of justice while the other four in the crowded dock face a single charge each.

Andrew
Edis QC, prosecuting, said: 'So far as Mrs Brooks is concerned it is 
well known that there are bail dates coming up in context of another 
investigation known as Operation Weeting at the end of July or in early 
August.

'No definitive 
timetable has been set out for any charging decision whether yes or no, 
nevertheless it is likely that if there is a charge in relation to her 
that might impact on this case if there isn't that might also.

'If there were to be charges then 
consideration might have to be given to the format of this whole trial, 
who is to be involved and how many trials and so on.'

Worlds apart: Back in London, Mrs Brooks faced the media circus that has followed her since being charged with plotting to pervert the course of justice in May

Trial Judge Mr Justice Fulford agreed: 'You need to know if this trial as it is currently constituted is going to take place.'

Mr
Edis said they hoped for a decision on further charges by August 22 but
could not guarantee it and may need to extend the time. He added: 'We 
are confident that the decision will be taken in time for this case to 
proceed smoothly.'

Brooks 
has hired Hugo Keith QC who represented the coroner at the 7/7 inquest 
and the government in the Shrien Dewani extradition hearing to represent
her.

He pointed out that it is not known for sure that any of the files relating to 11 journalists handed by Operation Weeting 
detectives related to Brooks.

Well turned out: Rebekah Brooks looked a far cry from the smiling and confident power dresser that strode into Westminster Magistrates' Court a fortnight ago for the first hearing (above)

He handed a bundle of press cuttings 
to the judge for his attention, explaining: 'There have been certain 
sites, blogs and the like where there has been some extremely offensive,
unpleasant and prejudical commentary.'

The first charge relating to the 
current case alleges that between July 6 and 19 last year she conspired 
with her husband, Carter, 48, News Internationals Head of Security Mark 
Hanna, 49, her chauffeur Paul Edwards, 48, her security consultant Daryl
Jorsling, 39, and others to conceal material from officers of the 
Metropolitan Police Service.

The second charge claims that she and Carter between July 6 and 9 2011 conspired to remove seven boxes of material from the New International archives.

The final charge alleges that Brooks and her husband along with Hanna, Edwards, Jorsling, and others conspired to conceal documents, computers and other electronic equipment from Met officers between July 15 and 19 2011.

Although all six are named in the first charge only Brooks is facing prosecution in relation to it.

She sat on the end of the row in the dock next to her husband Charlie, who went to Eton with Prime Minister David Cameron who was a close friend of the couple and they chatted and laughed as they waited for the judge.

Wearing a navy suit with a white shirt and pink he stared at the judge and made brief notes during the 30 minute hearing.

In a public statement after they were charged the couple, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, condemned the decision as a 'witch hunt' and said they would fight the charges.

They were all released on bail with conditions including that they could not contact their co-accused to return for pleas in September.

Brooks edited the News of the World from 2000 before taking the helm at The Sun in 2003. In 2009 she became chief executive of News International then quit her post last July in the same month the alleged criminality took place.

Days after she quit she was arrested over allegations of phone-hacking and corruption after a bag containing a laptop, iPhone and paperwork was found in a bin near her £1.5 million home in London's exclusive Chelsea Harbour.

In the same month Murdoch closed down the News of the World after public fury over allegations the paper had hacked the email of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Newspaper bosses are facing more damages claims following allegations that tabloid journalists hacked phones, a High Court judge heard today.

A lawyer told Mr Justice Vos that 50 claims against News Group Newspapers are currently itemised on a register.

But he indicated that about 20 more claims are set to be added to that list.

Dozens sued in the wake of allegations that journalists at the now-defunct News of the World newspaper, which was owned by News Group, hacked phones.

A trial is scheduled to start at the High Court in London in February.

Hugh Tomlinson QC, who represents a number of claimants seeking damages, outlined the latest damages claims at a High Court hearing in London.

'There are 50 issued claims,' he said. 'I understand that there are another 20-odd about to be placed on the register.'

Meanwhile, the High Court was today told News International lawyers are examining iPhones thought to have been used by company executives.

A barrister representing claimants said the existence of the News International iPhones emerged as a result of evidence given to the Leveson Inquiry.

David Sherborne told Mr Justice Vos that evidence was 'contrary' to previous evidence given to the High Court.

Mr Justice Vos said 'new' material found on the iPhones should be disclosed.

He told lawyers: 'If there is material that is new or is likely to be new then it should be disclosed.'

No detail was given in court about the iPhones or their users.

Mr Justice Vos was told about the iPhones at a hearing earlier this month.

Lawyers representing claimants said evidence suggested that the iPhones were used 'during the relevant period'.

The judge said who used the iPhones and what they were used for would be 'open for discussion'.
