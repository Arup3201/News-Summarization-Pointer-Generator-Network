The head stripper of Australia's Thunder from Down Under troupe has told a Las Vegas court how he and his friends dived on top of an intruder who allegedly stole G-strings from their dressing room.

Mathew Fardell said he came off stage at their show at the Excalibur Casino on March 18 and was told an intruder was being held by other members of his troupe.

He went out to a patio and saw his fellow strippers Aidan Te Puke and Ryan Paki struggling to control 24-year-old Joey Kadmir so he decided to subdue him by 'choking him out'.

Australian Thunder from Down Under stripper, Mathew Fardell, told a Las Vegas court how he tried to pin down the hand of a man threatening to fire a handgun inside their dressing room at the Excalibur casino in Las Vegas

The struggle continued with more strippers coming to help, before Kadmiri fell back on to the floor with the strippers on top of him.

Mr Fardell said he noticed Kadmiri was wearing  the blue Calvin Klein underpants Mr Te Puke wears in the show under his jeans.

He also noticed under the underpants Kadmiri was wearing one of his tight, black G-strings.

Las Vegas authorities allege Kadmiri was high on a drug, methamphetamine, when he snuck backstage of the Thunder Showroom in the Excalibur Casino on March 18, rifled through the troupe's belongings, and stole G-strings, underpants and other props from their show.

'He (Kadmiri) yelled, “I've got a gun. I'm going to shoot now”,' Mr Fardell told the court on Tuesday.

Mr Fardell didn't believe him after seeing the underpants and G-string.

'I kind of relaxed because, given he was wearing my thong and he had on Aidan's underwear, I thought, "I don't think he'd have a gun",' he said.

Joey Kadmiri, 24, faces nine felony burglary, robbery, battery and weapon charges after being accused of sneaking into the stripper's dressing room on March 18

He initially thought Kadmiri was talking about one of the fake guns the troupe uses in SWAT and gangster acts in their show. 

'I turned and in his hand was the biggest gun you have ever seen in your life,' he said.

'I don't know guns that well, but I knew it was .44 Magnum. It was massive.'

The performer said he put all of his might on Kadmiri's wrist to make sure the gun was pointing away from them before Kadmiri pulled the trigger, lodging the bullet in the wall of an Italian restaurant at the casino.

Mr Fardell was so close to the gun when it went off he suffered gunpowder burns on his face and in his left eye, and also suffered tinnitus in his left ear.

The ear was bleeding, but after security and police took Kadmiri into custody, Mr Fardell and his troupe went back on stage to finish the show.

'I could feel blood dripping on my shirt,' Mr said.

Kadmiri is alleged to have snuck into the Thunder Down Under dressing room on March 18 by claiming to be a new performer in the show

'It's a miracle that no one was killed,' Prosecutor Kenneth Portz said in his opening address.

'These men don't miss the gym all that much, and it still took six men to hold him.'

The .44 calibre Magnum revolver was a gun made famous by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies, Mr Portz told the court.

Prosecutors on Monday dropped eight of 17 charges originally filed by a grand jury in the case, including attempted murder, armed robbery and several counts of robbery with a weapon.

Kadmiri still faces nine felony burglary, robbery, battery and weapon charges, which could get him decades in prison if he's convicted.

The accused suffered a black eye and other minor injuries during the scuffle that saw him allegedly fire a gun

He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers, Joshua Tomsheck and Roy Nelson, plan to make their opening arguments later this week.

Mr Tomsheck has said Kadmiri had drug and mental health issues before the March 18 incident.

Police later found that Kadmiri had with him a pair of surgical gloves, an open 2.1-gram plastic packet of methamphetamine and a box of bullets for the handgun.

His lawyers haven't confirmed if Kadmiri will testify.

The trial continues.
