Christmas time is meant to be the season of giving.

But these greedy squirrels certainly weren't in the mood for sharing as they fought over a bunch of berries.

And it was clear who came out the victor, as his opponent was sent sprawling to the ground after a well-aimed punch.

Pow! A squirrel is knocked out by a rival after the pair got into a fight over a bunch of berries at the Nature Interpretation Centre, Lake Boivin, Canada

The fight was captured on camera by Canadian photographer, Andre Villeneuve, 63, at the Nature Interpretation Centre of Lake Boivin, Canada.

'This was the battle of the squirrels,' said Mr Villeneuve, of Qu'bec, Canada.

'One of the squirrels was attacked and it pushed the other on the back.

'The red squirrel is territorial, and so when the other squirrel started entering his land without permission things got out of hand.'

Before the fight erupted, the squirrels had been enjoying a civilised afternoon, playing around with Christmas cups and wreaths.

Mr Villeneuve said: 'They were busy for about four hours getting inside the cup and playing with berries.

'When most people see my photographs they tell me an event or a memory of their own Christmas.

'I just provided the props and the animals did the rest. This is the aim of my photography, and what I want to achieve.

'Through photography I like to show people that nature has is beautiful, and hopefully they will then try to protect it.'
