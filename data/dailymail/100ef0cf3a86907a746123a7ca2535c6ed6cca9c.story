A man bragged on Twitter after he killed a Royal Marine with a punch and carried on drinking.

Reece Kay, 20, knocked Commando Wes Clutterbuck unconscious after the Marine - who had granted home leave to attend a funeral - tried to break up a fight in Rochdale.

As 19-year old Marine Clutterback lay dying from head injuries Kay, who had drunk five vodka shots and ‘up to eight pints of lager’, went off to a nightclub and carried on drinking with friends before posting his Tweet at 5am.

Kay tweeted: 'Hahaha, 
f****** hand is killing me!'

The tweet: Reece Kay posted this tweet just a few hours after punching Royal Marine Wes Clutterbuck saying: 'Hahaha, f****** hand is killing me!'

He later handed himself in when he he 
woke up from his drunken stupor to discover thew soldier had been 
fatally injured when he cracked his skull against the pavement as he 
fell to the floor.

Marine Clutterback died later in hospital. His organs were donated to save 
the lives of patients on the organ waiting list - with part of his 
liver given to a 20-month-old baby boy.

Kay claimed he had hit the Marine as he ran at him from behind and gave him 'no chance' to defend himself.

At Manchester Crown Court, Kay, from Rochdale, Manchester, admitted manslaughter and was jailed for four years after a judge said he had shown 'genuine remorse'.

But Marine Clutterback mother's Sara Whitworth, 38, said the sentence was not long enough.

She said: 'This sentence is not long enough at all. A lot of young people have come to see justice done and the law in practice that is meant to protect us. Yet they have just seen that it is all an absolute sham and this sentence says it is ok to go out and punch and kill someone.

'I hope that this man cannot close his eyes at night for what he has done to our son. I will never ever forgive him.

'Wesley was a serving marine and he 
would have gone to war for his country to protect everyone including the
 judges and solicitors and the legal system.

'This is how he is repaid. This is how he is treated, it is a pathetic justice system. He would have gone to war for them and that’s how they have treated an upstanding marine.'The Marine was described by army officers as a 'charismatic and enthusiastic young Commando' joined the Marines in February last year and, after nine months, training passed for duty as an original member of 142 troop.

The tragedy occurred on June 29 after the Marine attended the funeral of a close friend before joining fellow mourners for a night out in Rochdale.

Mr Justin Hayhoe, prosecuting, said Kay and a friend Jake Johnson had spent the afternoon and evening drinking five shots of vodka and up to eight pints of lager and playing an X Box football game before heading into Rochdale shortly after midnight.

Remorse: Reece Kay fled the scene and headed to a nightclub after punching Royal Marine Wesley Clutterbuck, but a court heard that he handed himself into police after discovering he had died

The pair spotted a man and woman having an argument and Johnson told the woman to calm down.

The man left but the woman then slapped Johnson - causing Marine Clutterbuck to intervene.

Mr Hayhoe told the court the Commando was defending the woman when Kay became involved in the argument.

He said: 'Wesley was backing away from Reece Kay who had to be restrained a number of times.

'The defendant was becoming very agitated and one witness saw the victim walk away and told Kay to leave it and even grabbed him by the arm.

'But the defendant wasn’t calming down. He ran over the road towards Wesley at speed and gave him a forceful punch to the face.'

Kay fled as onlookers went to help the Marine who was unconscious and bleeding from a wound at the back of his head.

Kay then went to Mango’s nightclub for up to 30 minutes before friends said he left because he was 'feeling bad about what had happened earlier'. But the 20-year-old still posted a tweet that appeared to boast about his actions.

Kay handed himself into police at 3pm the following afternoon saying: ‘I’m really sorry I have hit him’.

My Hayhoe continued: 'He said he was leaving the Yates pub when he saw Jake arguing with a male and should have left it. He said the victim had said something which had annoyed him but couldn’t recall what but was provoked and so he ran after him and punched him.

'He said he had never seen Wesley before. He said Wesley had said something to him and he admitted running off. He said it was spur of the moment and was really angry and not like that normally and didn’t know why he didn’t it.

'He said he just ran over and hit him. He said he swung with his right hand and hit him on the head with his fist clenched, he said it was quite hard. He saw Wesley drop to the flow and ran because he was scared.'

In mitigation defence counsel Guy Mathieson said: 'This was a single punch delivered in drunken anger at a perceived insult.

'His remorse is apparent and repeated again and again. He has never sought to blame or cast any sign of the conduct on the late Wesley Clutterbuck.

'It is a stark lesson to young people who get drunk and aggressive how one blow can lead to a tragic loss of life. He would do anything to take that one punch back. He is a thoroughly decent young man.'

Behind bars: Reece Kay was only jailed for four years after the judge found he showed 'genuine remorse' for his actions

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Tim Holroyde told Kay: 'You had drunk more than was good for you and no doubt drink played its part in this crime. But I accept you have genuine remorse for what you have done.

'I accept that the tweet was in retrospect most unfortunate in the morning before you realised your actions had serious consequences. Wesley Clutterbuck was 19, and his young life which was full of promise was needlessly ended.

'His family are left to grieve for him and left with constant reminders what may have been if he had survived.'

Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a mindless unprovoked attack which ended in tragedy. It only takes one punch to kill someone and cause so much anguish.

'Wesley’s parents, family and friends were all extremely proud of his achievements; to lose a loved one in this way is totally devastating. Whatever sentence is imposed it will not compensate for their loss.'
