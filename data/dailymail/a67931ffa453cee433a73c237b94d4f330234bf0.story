Control pad demon: Prince Harry unwinds at Camp Bastion

Sitting exams at school was 'a nightmare' for Prince Harry, but like many of his age the third in line to the throne is a whiz at computer games on the PlayStation and Xbox.

Harry, who was educated at Ludgrove Prep School and Eton College, said he was 'absolutely useless' at written tests at school, but is making up for it now by beating his army colleagues at computer games.

He said: 'You can ask the guys: I thrash them at Fifa the whole time.'

In an interview conducted before he flew home to the UK from his deployment as an Apache helicopter co-pilot gunner (CPG), the 28-year-old revealed how he and his friends in 662 Squadron based in Camp Bastion played computer games and ate pizza when they had time off.

He also talked about his living conditions at the dusty army base, and revealed he was sent a jar of Clarence House honey made by bees at the Prince of Wales' official residence.

The young royal also said his father had sent him a box of Cuban cigars, some of which he traded with American soldiers in exchange for their treats from home.

Showing appealing modesty about his obvious skills as a pilot, the Prince said his skills at sports and games helped pave the way for him to become a top pilot.

He said: 'Exams were always a nightmare, but anything like kicking a ball around or playing PlayStation - or flying - I do generally find a little bit easier than walking, sometimes.

'It's a joy for me because I'm one of those people who loves playing PlayStation and Xbox, so with my thumbs I like to think that I'm probably quite useful.'

The Prince said taking the controls in the helicopter came naturally to him, and he qualified top of his class as a CPG despite finding the academic side tricky.

He said: 'I'm one of those people that, during my flying course especially, I would be fine at flying.

'And
then every now and then a written test would come up and I'd be 
absolutely useless, and I've been like that from stage one of my youth.'

Harry
had to repeat his last year at Ludgrove to get into Eton in 1998 and 
his GCSE results were never made public, but it was while he was at Eton
that he began to show his military potential in the cadets.

After a gap year, the young Prince went to Sandhurst, despite not going to university, and was then picked for Apache co-pilot gunner course.

He said: 'Being a junior captain, or a lieutenant then that I was and a non-grad [non-graduate], obviously not going to university, therefore the army presume you to be less intelligent, which is nice of them - probably true.

'But there were a couple of us that got pushed forward to the front seat instead of the back seat.'

After his 18 months of helicopter training in both the UK and US, the Prince won a prize as the best CPG out of his class of more than 20.

Playing it down, he said: 'The only reason I won the award is because I was the only one who didn't slip up at some point.

'They had to give the award to someone. I was one of the few left standing, so that's the only reason I got that award.'

But his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Tom de le Rue, said he won the prize on merit.

'That was absolutely the right decision that was made, and he has been performing superbly out here.

'He really is on top of his game. He's an excellent co-pilot gunner and I think he's very much enjoying being able to deliver support'.

Captain Simon Beattie, the other CPG on Harry's flight of two Apaches, said the Prince was reliable and sharp in the cockpit.

He said: 'It's nice to have someone who you know you can rely on as well in the other aircraft.

'He's quick. He keeps me on my toes to make sure I stay ahead of the game as well.'

Harry won the respect of his military colleagues at Camp Bastion for his ability to muck in with them without any special treatment.

As one of thousands of troops stationed in the isolated base in the Afghan desert, the Prince slept in a converted shipping container, sharing a room and eating and washing with everyone else.

The soldiers can get a fresh coffee or an alcohol-free beer at the Heroes Bar, pick up Afghan souvenirs at one of the local shops, and even get a takeaway at the Pizza Hut restaurant, also based in a former shipping container.

They go to the canteen for cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner, take their laundry or 'dhobi' to the laundrette, and can work out at a number of indoor or outdoor gyms.

The Prince said: 'Obviously lots of guys like the luxury and comforts of Bastion, but what's weird is we're stuck in Bastion and what's going on out there is completely separate.'

His closest friends in his unit - nicknamed 662 'Royal' Squadron by the other 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC) soldiers - were the other crew members on his flight of two aircraft.

Harry's four-man flight would usually work three consecutive overnight duties before moving on to other shifts on the aircrew rota.

While waiting for call-out, they would be in the VHR (very high readiness) tent, where they would play the military board game Uckers, watch films, play computer games and chat.

Off-duty, he would sleep in temporary sleeping quarters that he jokingly described as 'Luxury at is best, I guess'.

The third in line to the throne slept under a coverless duvet, with pillows and a black sleeping bag on a burgundy sprung mattress.

He said: 'It's flat, it's got springs, but it's better than a cot-bed, which is what all the other guys are sleeping in, when you can't really roll left to right and you're stuck in a V.'

He had an empty ammunition box as a beside table, home to his alarm clock and earplugs, and plain walls with a couple of rugs on the ground.

In the VHR tent, the soldiers had a well-stocked kitchen with fridge, toaster, microwave, and snacks including chocolate bars and jars of Marmite.

'A free minibar would be great', Harry joked.

The soldiers played computer games such as Fifa 13 with a fierce competitiveness, and agreed that their royal colleague was second in the rankings.

They also watched endless films on their 32-inch colour television, with piles of DVDs ranging from Apocalypse Now and Gladiator to the Hangover and Borat.

The Prince said: 'We've probably got every DVD, every film known to mankind, and we've probably watched all of them.'

In the run-up to Christmas, Harry put on a Father Christmas hat complete with pigtails.

He said: 'We watched a repeat of the Royal Variety Performance, which was quite entertaining.'

'When we started we'd be called out once, maybe twice at the most, but now it's cold it's fairly quiet.  Less stuff happens at night.'

The Prince would get up early when it was his turn to make a cafetiere of coffee for his crew members, and joked he was so tired that he was still asleep.

Capt Beattie said: 'It's easy to put aside the fact that he's third-in-line to the throne.  He's a normal guy.'

He said he didn't think twice before teasing the Prince, because 'He's pretty forward on the banter as well - it's just part of us all being together.'

The Prince's squadron commander, Major Ali Mack, said: 'I think he enjoys the relative anonymity of being in theatre where he is allowed to get on with his daily business relatively unmolested and as a squadron we are very much one big family.'

Prince Harry, who previously served on the ground coordinating air strikes on the Taliban during his 2007-2008 tour in Afghanistan, says he missed being on the ground.

Standing in front of his £45m Apache helicopter, he said: 'It's a pain in the a*** being stuck in Bastion; going to the cookhouse with hundreds of people - it's frustrating.

'But then again, I get to fly this thing, so it comes with pros and cons.'
