Five British siblings with a unique genetic condition affecting their joints have been told that their condition is so rare that it might be named after them.

All five children in the Lambert family in south Yorkshire suffer from a disorder that predominately affects their bones and joints - a condition that has stumped doctors around the world.

Their parents Cat and David Lambert, both 37, do not suffer from the disorder, but their children Bethany, 16, Leon, 14, Dawson, nine, Nyle, eight, and Miya, seven, all do.

The disease includes symptoms such as a twisted spine, improper bone growth and trouble growing muscle.

Some of the children also have learning difficulties because of the condition - which affects all the children to different degrees of severity.

And after half-a-decade of research doctors could now even name the condition - Lambert’s Syndrome.

Cat said: 'Doctors from all over the world have been left puzzled by the condition affecting my children.

'DNA samples have been sent to experts at Cambridge and Oxford Universities.

'They have even sent DNA to experts in America, Canada, Finland and Sweden as part of ongoing research - but no known syndrome has been discovered yet.'

Teaching assistant Cat added: 'It seems to affect all the joints in their bodies mainly.

'So they are either unusable - because they are so stiff - or so overly flexible that they dislocate constantly.

'Leon’s fingers used to dislocate around 50 times a day.

'He used to see it as some kind of party trick when he was younger, but it gets extremely painful for him after a while.'But then Dawson can’t even make a fist with his hand because his fingers are so stiff.

'I don’t think we’ll ever get to the bottom of what the syndrome is.

'We’ve had so many tests now and they’ve not been able to find a match against any known condition in the world over.

'Doctors have said it is extremely rare for a syndrome like ours to be discovered in this day-and-age.

'One consultant even said that they could name this condition after the family if future tests are inconclusive.'

She added: 'It’s definitely a claim-to-fame, I suppose, but a claim we could live without.'

The child most affected by the condition is Dawson and the brave youngster has had a constant string of operations since being born.

Cat said: 'Dawson was born in June and had his first operation the following January on his pelvis.

'He even had bone cut of his hip and put into his feet to help him walk - almost like a skin graft with bone - to reconstruct his feet in four places.

Despite the condition affecting every one of their children, parents David and Cat have said that they are able to lead a perfectly normal life

The condition predominantly affects the children's joints and bones, making them stiff and often painful

'He had to be in a wheelchair for approximately nine months after that operation because he can’t grip crutches because the joints in his hand are so stiff and he has very little muscle growth.'

Because the disorder also halts tendon growth (the connective tissue between muscle and bone), Dawson has to have an operation every month to stretch them.

He will need these operations until he reaches the point when he stops growing.

But despite this, the brave youngster - who could barely even manage one footstep after the surgery to reconstruct his feet - recently completed a 10-mile trek in aid of Sheffield Children’s Hospital in south Yorkshire, who performed the operation.

As a result of the walk Dawson raised £612 for the cause.

All of the children have suffered the syndrome their entire lives, which often takes the form of their muscles and tissue not growing properly, often requiring painful surgery to correct

He said: 'Walking is something people don’t really think about, but for me it’s been life changing.

'Every penny I make can help other people and go towards finding the next cure and improving someone else’s life.

'I’m getting on fine now, I can do lots more things and it feels excellent.'

His mother said: 'At his worst, he couldn’t walk at all and needed a wheelchair.

'Without the physio he wouldn’t be able to get out of bed or go to school.

The family are active members of their local church, and the eight-year-old son, Dawson, has recently undertaken a charity event where he undertook a 10-mile trek to raise money for the local children's hospital

'We have to get up very early, especially when it’s cold and he needs to warm up at home first.

'Usually they would only operate on one foot at a time, but the condition means Dawson can’t use crutches.

'Once his pots were off he wanted to be walking everywhere straight away, but he had to learn how to do it all again.

'His walking is much better now.

'He has become more stable and can take more solid steps. At one point, he needed to wear a helmet because he was falling over all the time.

The disorder affects muscle growth, but also often leads to learning difficulties in later life, as well as other problems like a lack of adult tooth growth

'But he is brilliant with dealing with it all. He gives 110 per cent in everything.'

Despite the condition affecting every one of her children, Cat describes the family as 'normal and happy'.

The condition that all the children share is thought to be the only one of its kind, and is rare enough to the point that it might be named after them - although a member of the General Medical Council says this is also a rarity

Cat said: 'You are constantly being presented with new challenges in life and this one is ours.

'We just get on with things, though. We are happy, we are normal and we would not have things any other way.'

Derek Burke, Medical Director, at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases for reasons of patient confidentiality.

However, it is important to note that it is no longer normal practice to name syndromes after doctors or families.

'At the Trust we host the Regional Clinical Genetics service.

'Our knowledge of rare genetic conditions, and testing available on a service basis, is improving all the time.

'However, where a diagnosis still remains unknown, we provide opportunities for families to take part in research studies that we hope will find the cause for their condition.'
