Gus Poyet wants a witch to cast a spell on injury-plagued Steven Fletcher after revealing his fears that the Sunderland striker was set for another lengthy spell on the sidelines.

The Scotland international has been passed fit for Monday's trip to Crystal Palace despite worries that he had broken a metatarsal.

Fletcher – who has suffered similar injuries before – limped out of the 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal last weekend after a stamp on his foot.

Poyet was immediately warned by his medical team that his two-goal top scorer could have suffered serious damage.

But there was positive news on Friday as the Black Cats boss confirmed that Fletcher was okay, although he would welcome the intervention of an injury-preventing potion.

'I need a witch,' said Poyet. 'I need someone to come here and throw something on him.

'I feared he had broken his metatarsal. That was a shout. The doctor said to me it could be that because of the pain he had and where it was.

'Lucky enough it was not, which is great. He has had two or three days' rest with the bruising and has trained without any problems now.

'So I am really looking forward to seeing him on the pitch on Monday.'

Meanwhile, Poyet says that Danny Graham's Sunderland career is not over, despite a loan move to Brentford collapsing earlier this week.

The 29-year-old striker – who signed for £5million from Swansea in January, 2013 – has only made 13 league appearances for the club and is yet to score.

And Poyet believes it is now up to Graham to determine how his season plays out.

'I think he has been close,' said the Uruguayan. 'But it depends on the characteristics of the team. If you use the wingers well they can put balls in and give you a chance 'I don't think we've been doing that whatsoever so we have needed a different proposition, but it's up to him every day.
