Following Apple's CarPlay announcement last week, the company has now updated its iOS software to add the hands-free options to iPhones and iPads.

Apple is selling the product as a 'smarter, safer and more fun way to use an iPhone in the car' because it uses Siri voice commands to control entertainment and other in-car features - but safety campaigners are not convinced.

Researchers from Texas Transportation Institute recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while 
driving - on software including Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as 
texting with fingers.

The AAA Foundation's results confirm the recent findings from the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University.

In April last year, Texas researchers found that using voice to send text messages while driving - on software such as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers.

They found both methods impacted
 driver response times equally - but it often took voice 
recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages.

Apple announced its CarPlay system last week after adding Eyes-Free technology to its iOS software last year.

It updated the iOS software yesterday to make the CarPlay functions more widely available.

A car equipped with the CarPlay technology lets a user connect their handset to the system and use their car's built-in display and controls.

The Siri Eyes-Free tool lets users without Car Play-compatible cars control the system in a similar, using voice commands.

While a separate study from the
 AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the U.S., discovered that 
hands-free kits increase mental workload and distractions, causing 
reaction times to get 
slower and brain function to become compromised.

This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians.

Cognitive distraction expert David Strayer and his research team at the 
University of Utah measured brainwaves, eye movement and other metrics 
to assess what happens to drivers’ mental workload when they attempt to 
do multiple things at once.

Mr Strayer fitted cars with mounted cameras that tracked the eye and head movement of drivers.

A Detection-Response-Task device known as the 'DRT' was used to record
 driver reaction time in response to triggers of red and green lights 
added to their field of vision.

A special electroencephalographic (EEG)-configured skull cap was also fitted to the drivers' head and was used 
to track the participants’ brain activity so that researchers could 
determine mental workload.

To measure the distractions, drivers were played an audio book. There brainwaves were also measured while they talked on the phone and while they listened to telephone conversations.

The drivers were then monitored while voice-activated emails were played to them directly from their handset.

Drivers' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice-activated emails were played to them, in a system similar to that used in Apple's CarPlay, pictured. Talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk, but listening to voice-activated features was classed as an extensive risk

Researchers used the results of these tests to rate the levels of mental distraction 
drivers experienced while performing each task.

These levels of mental 
distraction were represented on a scale, similar to the Saffir-Simpson scale used for hurricanes.

Tasks such as listening to the radio ranked as a Category 1 level of distraction and were rated as a minimal risk. Talking on a phone, both handheld and hands-free, resulted in a Category 2, moderate risk.

Surprisingly, listening and responding to in-vehicle, voice-activated email features
 increased mental workload and distraction levels of the drivers to a  Category 3 - and was classed as an extensive risk.

Some 35 per cent of drivers admit to 
reading a text or email while driving in any given month, while 26 
percent admitted to typing one, according to data from AAA.

Russ Martin, pictured, had his brainwaves monitored while listening to his emails being read aloud to him from his phone. His mental workload increased and his reaction times were slower. Researchers from the AAA Foundation concluded that voice-activated technologies pose an 'extensive risk' to drivers

'There is a looming public safety crisis ahead with the future proliferation of these in-vehicle technologies,' said AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet.

'It’s time to consider limiting new and potentially dangerous mental  distractions built into cars, particularly with the common public misperception that hands-free means risk-free.'

AAA Foundation Presidents and CEO Peter Kissinger added: 'These findings reinforce previous research that hands-free is not risk-free.;

'Increased mental workload and cognitive distractions can lead to a type of tunnel vision or inattention blindness where motorists don’t see potential hazards right in front of them.'

As well as Apple's Siri, other voice-activated technology include the Joyride app that lets you play trivia games using your voice, while driving. Voice-activated assistant app Vlingo is also built into some Samsung models.

Google's
 Android software has voice-controls and a special 'car mode' that 
allows users to access commonly used functions via large buttons.

Based on their research, the foundation is suggesting a number of initiatives to tackle the problem.

The Vlingo app is built into some Samsung handsets and is a Siri alternative

It wants to 'limit the use of voice-activated technology to core driving-related activities such as climate control, windshield wipers and cruise control, and to make sure these applications do not lead to increased safety risk caused by mental distraction while the car is moving.'

The AAA Foundation wants voice-to-text technologies such as using social media or listening to emails and text messages disabled.

'This study constitutes the most in-depth analysis to date of mental distractions behind the wheel. 

AAA is hopeful that it will serve as a stepping stone toward working in collaboration with automakers to promote our shared goal of improving safety for all drivers,' said Darbelnet.

'Specifically, these increasingly common voice-driven, in-vehicle technologies should be limited to use for just core driving tasks unless the activity results in no significant driver distraction.'
