This time last year we were struggling through blizzards… but today Britain is expected to be hotter than Spain.

Temperatures climbed to a summery 20.9C (69.6F) in the South East yesterday and today is expected to be almost as hot.

That is compared to Madrid, where it is set to be a mere 14C (57F) and 18C (64F) in Ibiza.

There will be sunshine nationwide for most of the day, although some areas will have a shower or two.

The balmy spell is driven by tropical winds arriving from Africa, making temperatures across the UK higher than average for this time of year.

The sun is set to last all week, but if you are already imagining hitting the beach this weekend, dispel that daydream. It is expected to cool down before Saturday.

John Lee, Meteogroup forecaster, said: ‘It’s looking fairly mild over the next week.’

As the clocks moved forward an hour for British Summer Time yesterday, temperatures exceeded 20C (68F) in many areas.

St James’s Park in London and Santon Downham in Norfolk were the hottest parts of Britain, reaching 20.9C (69.6F), according to MeteoGroup.

The previous highest temperature so far this year was 20.5C (68.9F) in Gravesend, Kent, on March 9.

In the Balearic Islands yesterday it was 18C (64F) and 16C (60F) in the French Riviera. In Bournemouth, a sea breeze brought the thermometer down to 16C (60F) but that did not stop thousands of sunseekers from flocking to the coast.

Fog on the Tyne: As the rest of the country basked in glorious sunshine this weekend, a thick fog made the iconic Tyne Bridge barely visible to onlookers in Newcastle

Barely visible: The Angel of the North can hardly be seen in Gateshead. Eastern Scotland and the North East of England saw misty spells

Sarah Gorment, 43, from Southampton, was on the beach with  her family.

She said: ‘The roads were very busy getting here today but the rewards have been worth it because it is beautiful and sunny.
‘I remember what last March was like and how cold it was but this year it feels more like summer.’

In late March last year, Britain was shivering in snow and temperatures fell to minus10C (14F). There were drifts as high as 4ft in the North and 20,000 homes lost power.
