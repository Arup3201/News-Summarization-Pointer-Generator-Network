On May 13 2012, during a routine fixture between Espanyol and Sevilla on the final day of the Spanish season, Mauricio Pochettino’s journey into English football began.

Up in the stands, Southampton’s former chairman Nicola Cortese was on a scouting mission to watch Philippe Coutinho, who was on loan at Espanyol, with manager Nigel Adkins.

There was a touchline aura about Pochettino that convinced Cortese to make further enquiries about this Argentine coach.

New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs

When they spoke, soon after  Pochettino was fired by Espanyol in November 2012, Cortese showed him a video presentation called ‘The Southampton Way’.

In it he had borrowed ideas from Barcelona’s high-tempo pressing game. Cortese wanted his aspirational Saints, just promoted to the Barclays Premier League, to adopt the same tactics.

Pochettino, who is close friends with former Barcelona  defender Carles Puyol, was sold on the idea. In time there may yet be a role for the  Barcelona great at White Hart Lane.

Cortese’s departure — the pair have not spoken since the executive chairman left abruptly in January —  created an excuse for Pochettino and his star players to agitate for moves elsewhere. Others want out now.

Happy man: Spurs chairman Daniel Levy believes Pochettino will bring back attacking football

In April, Mino Raiola, the bellicose agent of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, touted Pochettino around France to Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco and Marseille.

The Southampton manager travelled to the Parc des Princes for the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Chelsea, ostensibly on a scouting mission. Everybody knew why he was really there.

Had Laurent Blanc failed to win Ligue 1, the Qatari owners of European football’s emerging superpower would have replaced him at the end of the season with Pochettino. It was a mighty close call. He earned £2m a year at St Mary’s and will earn substantially more now he has a five-year contract as Tottenham’s latest manager.

Last week, when Spurs realised that their principal target Carlo Ancelotti would be staying at Real Madrid regardless of the result in the Champions League final, frantic phone calls began. The scales were delicately balanced between Frank de Boer and his four successive titles with Ajax and the credentials of up-and-coming Pochettino.

Spurs executives called pretty much anyone who had ever come into contact with Pochettino as part of their due diligence. Virtually all of them said the job had come too soon in the 42-year-old’s managerial career. But Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy pressed ahead.

Pochettino undoubtedly has special talents, particularly his relationship with young players. The expectation is that Tottenham’s £30million record signing Erik Lamela, injured for most of last season, will respond to his compatriot’s ideas. The Argentine’s training sessions are meticulously planned and he is usually stationed in the centre of the pitch making demands of his players — in perfect English.

Though Pochettino is credited with the recruitment and development of Southampton’s young stars, most of that was taken care of by Cortese and the club’s head of recruitment, Paul Mitchell.

The arrival of Dejan Lovren from Lyon last summer for £7m came after one of the most sophisticated analytical checks in club history. Lovren is now worth three times that fee.

The golden rule at Tottenham is to make sure you never humiliate the chairman Daniel Levy. Embarrass him by losing  6-0 at Manchester City or 5-0 at home to Liverpool (below) or three times in a season to West Ham and your job will be on the line.

One of Mauricio Pochettino’s priorities is to shore up a defence that leaked 51 goals in the Premier League last season — 23 of them at White Hart Lane.

He must convince poor Hugo Lloris, probably the best keeper in the division last season, to stick it out for another season.

There is an issue in every area of Tottenham’s defence and Pochettino must decide whether to let Michael Dawson leave for Crystal Palace or keep him another year.

Fellow Argentinian Erik Lamela, who barely played a game under Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood because of an injury, must come good next season. The indications are that Lamela wants to prove himself.

Up front Pochettino must get Emmanuel Adebayor, a notoriously difficult character, onside. That will not be easy.Pochettino wants to bring in Adam Lallana, but the England forward still prefers a move to Liverpool to play Champions League football.

That wasn't the problem! Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen were excellent going forward last year 

Major blow: Southampton could now lose the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and James Ward-Prowse

In the manager’s office at Southampton’s Marchwood training ground, industrial-sized boxes of mate, the caffeine-rich tea that is a staple in Argentina, would be delivered to Pochettino and his staff, who drinks gallons of it.

Pochettino would often invite one of his favourite players, such as left back Luke Shaw, to shoot the breeze. Shaw, a young, impressionable player, gets on brilliantly with the man who has left St Mary’s. Adam Lallana and Lovren are in the same category.

But it has emerged that at Saints, there were two distinct categories of player, with the favoured few appearing to be given preferential treatment by the manager. There was evidence of this at Espanyol too, where one of his former players shone a light on the way Pochettino handled players at a club he left in November 2012.

Time to go: Spurs fans were glad to see the back of Tim Sherwood as manager

‘He wanted to control everything,’ claimed former Espanyol midfielder Moises Hurtado. ‘The first season was fine. He’d been a player and he understood, but then things changed.

‘He seemed to see conspiracy where there was none, and some good people had to leave by the back door. He wanted everyone to dance to his tune, for people to be entirely committed to him. The atmosphere ended up not being so good. But in purely sporting terms there was no problem. He got great results and we played well.’

Those who have worked with him claim Pochettino, who played at the 2002 World Cup, is high maintenance. He sulks if results go against him and was spending less time on the training field towards the end of last season. By then, this ambitious man had decided to leave Saints. It’s Spurs, as ever, who have gambled on him.
