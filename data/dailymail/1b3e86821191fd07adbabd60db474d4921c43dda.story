Breaking silence: The outraged former paratrooper said he is an obvious target as he lives a secret life

A soldier facing questioning in the new Bloody Sunday investigation has spoken of his fury after suspected IRA bomber John Downey was given a police guarantee he would not face trial.

Breaking his silence after 32 years, the former paratrooper – one of the few to have spoken out since Bloody Sunday – said it was appalling that Downey had escaped prosecution for the 1982 Hyde Park terror blast, which left four soldiers and seven horses dead.

An Old Bailey judge last week ruled Downey could not be prosecuted because Northern Ireland police had wrongly guaranteed him immunity.

The ex-soldier meanwhile has received a letter from the same force warning his identity may now be exposed because of a fresh inquiry into the Londonderry massacre.

Condemning what he called ‘double standards’, the ex-soldier said: ‘So much for British justice. Being named could end my life.’

It has also emerged that 187  suspected IRA killers received ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ letters from the  Police Service of Northern Ireland saying they would not face trial for historic terror offences.

Last night, in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, the former paratrooper said at his Ulster home: ‘Downey receives a letter promising him he will not have to face justice and I am warned I face another investigation. Why don’t they just throw the Bloody Sunday paratroopers to the IRA wolves and be done with it?

‘I’ve had Bloody Sunday hanging over me for more than 40 years, even though I didn’t even fire a shot on the day. This has been a lifetime of suspicion and fear that our anonymity will be lifted. Who cares about us? Everything has swung the terrorists’ way.’

The soldier, who observes strict security procedures to protect himself and his family, has previously given detailed evidence on oath about Bloody Sunday to the Saville Inquiry – the judge-led investigation into the incident in which 13 civilians died.

This newspaper has seen his statement to Lord Saville and photographic evidence that he belonged to a  company from the 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (1 Para), which was sent into the Creegan area of Londonderry to counter a civil rights protest on January 30, 1972.

In December last year the soldier received a letter from the C2 Serious Crime Branch of the PSNI warning him that he faces a new legal ordeal.

The letter – one of the first to have ever been made public – reads: ‘The PSNI will seek to make contact with and re-interview former military  witnesses who provided evidence to the public inquiry or persons who may have information deemed relevant to the current police inquiry.

‘During the Saville inquiry it was ruled that anonymity be granted to any soldier who gave evidence unless his name was clearly already in the public domain.

'That ruling does not automatically carry over to the current police investigation. Anonymity will be a matter for the criminal court to consider afresh should criminal proceedings arise.’

'So much for justice - this could end my life'

The soldier has refused to reply to the letter and says he will not willingly be interviewed again by police. This stance could result in his arrest should detectives take the view that he is compromising their inquiries.

To his dismay, the same soldier received another letter in January, this time from the Ministry of Defence’s Directorate of Judicial Engagement Policy, based in London.

It warned that the criminal investigation into Bloody Sunday was ‘now beginning to gather momentum’.

The letter, signed by the Caron Tassel, a senior civil servant at the Directorate, continued: ‘I do understand that receipt of this letter (and one from the PSNI) may cause you some concern.

'Please be assured it is our policy to ensure appropriate support is provided to our people, whether serving or veterans, in circumstances when their actions while on operations come under judicial scrutiny.’

The ex-soldier is determined to protect himself and his family.

Aftermath: The blast left dead horses strewn across the streets and killed 11 military personnel

Since leaving the Army and settling in Northern Ireland, he has maintained rigorous procedures to ensure he does not give Republican terrorists clues  as to his identity and whereabouts.

Decades of discipline could be  shattered if he is ever brought to trial over the Bloody Sunday deaths.

In a bid to find civilian witnesses to the tragedy, the PSNI has even resorted to putting up billboards appealing for people to come forward – a move described as ‘grotesque’ by Tory MPs.

The ex-soldier also told this newspaper of his concerns over the administrative error that saw Downey receive a ‘comfort letter’ telling him he would not face prosecution.

'I live a secret life - I am an obvious target'

He said he was worried similar mistakes could lead to his own family’s whereabouts being made public – and then their being targeted by the IRA.

He said: ‘John Downey apparently received his “comfort letter” by mistake. Well that was a colossal mistake and an insult to the families of the British soldiers killed on that day in Hyde Park who desperately wanted him to face justice.

‘If an official can make a mistake on that scale it’s not remotely unlikely the wrong button will be pressed  by somebody inside the PSNI, or the office of any lawyers used by the MoD, and a document will be released in an un-redacted form.

‘Another real possibility is that Republicans could infiltrate the PSNI’s Serious Crime Branch. Security clearance doesn’t count for much. If they get one guy in there I could be taken out, and given that I’m living over here I’d be an obvious target for them.

The soldier with his fellow Paras, whose identities are protected, could face an inquiry at the Old Bailey

‘For these reasons I live a covert life, a secret life and regard all strangers very warily indeed. All information about me is on a strict, need-to-know basis. I have a cover story and I stick to it.

‘It would be a coup for the IRA to take out a Bloody Sunday paratrooper and we’ve seen with the recent letter bombing campaign  targeting Army recruitment offices in England that they got the capability and the will to carry it out.

'But why should I leave my home? I live in the UK and I should be able to live here without being harassed. This is my right and I am going to protect it. After all, I served my country.’

The PSNI’s new investigation into Bloody Sunday is expected to take several years and requires soldiers to testify again because the evidence they gave to the Saville Inquiry is not admissible in a criminal probe.

More than 100 soldiers gave evidence at the hearings after receiving assurances nothing they said would lead to criminal action being taken against them.

Lord Saville’s findings were deeply critical of the Army. Responding to his report’s findings in 2010, David Cameron described the shootings as ‘unjustified and unjustifiable’.

Up to 15 ‘shooters’ – those Paras who shot into the crowd – are expected to face the closest scrutiny from the PSNI. Defence sources said last night that the first formal requests for Bloody Sunday veterans to be interviewed under caution are expected ‘very soon’.

A MoD spokesman said: ‘The police are still investigating the events of that day and only when that is complete will the relevant authorities be in a position to decide the next steps. The MoD takes very seriously its obligations to former soldiers who face allegations of wrong-doing while on operations.’
