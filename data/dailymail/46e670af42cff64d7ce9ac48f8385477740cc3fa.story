Still wish you were here? 

These are the holiday snaps that might fail to make anyone jealous as two fearless sightseers chase the perfect picture dangling off Europe's most famous buildings.

Daredevils Vitaliy Raskalov, 20, and Vadim Makhorov, 24, have scaled some of the most recognisable tourist attractions on the planet and captured every moment.

Fed up with queues and typical tours, the thrill-seeking duo have taken to the rooftops of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, Cologne's Cathedral, and the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in Paris.Scroll down for video

Sky high: Travellers Vadim Makhorov (pictured dangling from the cathedral in Cologne) and Vitaliy Raskalov have scaled some of the world's most recognisable tourist attractions

Also taking on Giza's pyramids and Dubai's latest skyscrapers, the Russian travellers have been labelled 'The Skywalkers'.

In just one month the pair, from Novosibirsk and Moscow, conquered 12 cities in seven countries including Stockholm, Warsaw, Prague, Frankfurt, Cologne, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, Benidorm, Lisbon, Porto and Madrid and have seen the world like no one else.

Mr Raskalov said: ‘We are just chasing the dream and always looking to go to the next highest point to see the things no one else gets to see.

Oh la la! Mr Raskalov gets a view of the Eiffel Tower that few tourists in Paris get from a nearby rooftop. The pair capture every thrill-seeking moment on camera

Don't look down: The daredevils have gained the name 'Skywalkers' for photographs such as this, legs dangling from the Eiffel Tower at a dizzy height

From where you'll never be: The pair often stake out locations for hours, trying to find the best way to scale the structures and get past security, who have been known to have beaten the Russian travellers when they've caught them

‘We don't mean to trespass or harm anyone one so we do often have to wait until the coast is clear.

‘But when you get there the views are spectacular and we want to keep going until we have mastered every city.’

The pair regularly stake out locations in the early hours of the morning, waiting for guards and security staff to turn their back.

Mr Raskalov said: ‘Sometimes you can wait around all evening for the perfect chance, but you get there and then you are seen.

Say cheese! Mr Raskalov and Mr Makhorov (left to right) pose for a photo 'skywalking' above Warsaw after they got sick of waiting in queues at popular tourist attractions

Cool, calm and collected: Mr Raskalov chats on his mobile phone while sitting on a ledge of a skyscraper building in the Spanish town Benidorm

'Chasing the dream': The pair have scaled buildings and structures in 12 cities in seven countries including Paris (left) in France and Warsaw (right) in Poland and are 'always looking to go to the next highest point to see the things no one else gets to see,' Mr Raskalov said

Trespass trapeze: Mr Makhorov holds his balance on a structure in Benidorm, one of many off-limits buildings in which the pair sneak past security guards to access

‘When that happens and you are caught guards can beat you up quite a bit - but it's never too bad.

‘The views are worth it overall as you're taken to the top of the world with some of the most beautiful surroundings.

‘It's usually quite straightforward to scale roofs but in Russia it's a little bit more tricky - that's the main place where it can be dangerous.’

The death-defying ‘skywalkers’ have garnered a huge following online and insist they don't do it for the attention.

Mr Makhorov said: ‘A lot of people really like what we do and say 'well done' but we're just focused on enjoying what we do and seeing the most spectacular cities from above.

‘You can get better than that - but we certainly wouldn't recommend everybody having a go because of course it is dangerous.’

Greetings from Benidorm: People and beach umbrellas look like ants from the skywalkers' view from the top, who now have a huge following online but insist they don't do it for the attention

Will master every city: Climbing to death-defying heights to take their photographs, the pair (Mr Makhorov pictured) plan to keep scaling sky high structures in cities around the world

See the world like no one else: Mr Raskalov leans precariously from a building to get his desired shot high above the streets of the picturesque city of Prague in the Czech Republic

Don't look down: The duo, who scaled structures in Paris (left) and Warsaw (right), do not recommend other punters try out their stunts, saying it is too dangerous

No freefall in Frankfurt: The 'skywalkers' say they're focussed on enjoying their adventures and seeing the most spectacular cities in the world from far above
