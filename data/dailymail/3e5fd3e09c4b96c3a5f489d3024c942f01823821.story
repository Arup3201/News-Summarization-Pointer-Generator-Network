Hearing aids have been free on the NHS since the health service was set up

Thousands of elderly people will be blocked from getting hearing aids on the NHS, under plans being considered by health service bosses.

Hearing aids have been free on the NHS ever since the health service was founded in 1948 - but one GP-led group has put forward plans to charge patients for all but the most hard-of-hearing.

In North Staffordshire elderly patients that are struggling to hear will now be forced to pay up to £3,000 to go private.

Labour's shadow health secretary said the development showed there was an 'accelerating postcode lottery' in the NHS which could be rolled out across the country hitting millions.

Some 10 million people in the UK are affected by hearing loss - with that number set to soar to 14.5 million by 2031. 

Mr Burnham said people were being denied treatment because of 'arbitrary' rules decided by clinical commissioning groups - which now run the NHS.

In a speech in the Commons this afternoon, he said: 'There is now a proposal in one area to end the provision of hearing aids on the NHS. This is totally unacceptable.'

The charity Action on Hearing Loss has warned the move sets a dangerous national precedent which could leave 'millions unable to live their lives'.

Mr Burnham asked the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt if he would guarantee that patients won’t be forced to pay for hearing aids on his watch. Mr Hunt refused.

The issue was raised after the pair clashed during health questions over warnings from leading doctors that patients are being denied 'vital'

surgical procedures because local health authorities are imposing restrictions on care.

The Royal College of Surgeons said that patients across England are facing a postcode lottery as to whether or not they get some types of treatment.

Mr Burnham said guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was being contradicted and asked Mr Hunt to 'act immediately'.

The Health Secretary insisted Nice guidance should be followed but added more people are being treated every year, including knee and hip replacements, due to extra doctors in the NHS.

Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham challenged his Tory counterpart Jeremy Hunt to end the 'totally unacceptable' post code lottery in the the NHS

Mr Burnham then told Mr Hunt: 'You say CCGs should be following Nice guidance but they are not.

'Seven out of 10 are not following the guidance and people today waiting for operations will be left in pain because you are not acting.

'The truth is the reorganisation has resulted in a postcode lottery writ large.

Mr Hunt replied: 'I make it absolutely clear that everyone should follow Nice guidance.

'But as you talked about the reorganisation, will you please accept we are doing 850,000 more operations on the NHS every single year?

'That means more people are getting help with their hearing, with their hips, with their knees, with all the other things that they need and that reorganisation is something you bitterly opposed.'

'You must now realise you were wrong to oppose it then and wrong to oppose it now.'
