A businessman was horrified when he found a huge venomous spider in a bottle of Tesco finest white wine.

Peter Berry, 66, said the two-inch long arachnid was spotted floating in the wine as a guest picked up the bottle from an ice bucket during a party.

He bought the £7.99 bottle of Vin de Pays d'Oc Grenache Marsanne for his mother and mother-in-law's joint 90th birthday celebrations.

Mr Berry, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, said: 'It's disgusting. You'd expect to find a spider in your bathroom, not in a bottle of wine.

'We were having a great time at the party until my niece found it. Like most people, she's scared of spiders and it made her feel quite freaked out.

'We're just thankful she noticed it before someone poured the contents into a glass and swallowed it without realising.'

Mr Berry, who is a business consultant, bought the bottle at Tesco's branch in Bradley Stoke, Bristol.

 Ian Rotherham, of Sheffield Hallam University, has identified the 
spider as an Araneus - a spider found throughout Europe.

Thankfully, it is not dangerous although it does have venom and is known to bite humans.

After discovering the rogue spider, Mr Berry made an email complaint to Tesco and was advised to return the bottle to the store, which he is yet to do.

A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our products.

'Our customer service team have asked Mr Berry to return the product to us as soon as possible so that we can conduct a thorough investigation.'
