Simon Cowell may not be used to sharing the spotlight, but it seems he may have to after he was named joint top in a poll of America's highest earning TV personalities.

X Factor founder Cowell was named in first place alongside America's Got Talent judge and shock jock Howard Stern, with both raking in around $95million in the 12 months to June.

Cowell took the top spot despite Fox canceling the U.S. version of his show after he walked away from the project, and after walking away from the America's Got Talent competition. 

Simon Cowell and Howard Stern both made $95million from their entertainment empires in the 12 months to July according to Forbes, who took data from their agents, lawyers and managers

Oprah Winfrey, once the highest earner in 2012 on $165million, has since slipped to fourth place with $82million, behind the likes of Glenn Beck 

In third place was controversial right-wing mouthpiece and ex-Fox News commentator Glenn Beck, earning an impressive $90million.

Forbes magazine spoke to agents, managers and lawyers of each celebrity to come up with estimates for their entertainment-related earnings.

1. Simon Cowell - $95million

1. Howard Stern - $95 million

3. Glenn Beck - $90 million

4. Oprah Winfrey - $82 million

5. Phil McGraw - $77million

6. Ellen DeGeneres - $70 million

7. Rush Limbaugh - $66 million

8. Ryan Seacrest - $65 million

9. Gordon Ramsay - $47 million

10. Judge Judy Sheindlin - $47 million

According to their data Oprah Winfrey earned $82million in the last year, putting her in fourth place, a dramatic fall from the 2012 list in which she was named top with earnings of $165million.

Phil McGraw - more commonly known as Dr Phil - is in fifth place with earnings of $77million.

Ellen DeGeneres, the chat show host and comic, ranks sixth with $70million, followed by Rush Limbaugh on $66million and Ryan Seacrest on $65million.

Scottish chef Gordon Ramsay, host of Hell's Kitchen USA, came in at number nine with entertainment earnings estimated at $47million, while Judge Judy Sheindlin - the host of real-life courtroom drama show Judge Judy, completed the top ten with earnings of $47 million dollars.

As well as sitting on the judging panel for X Factor UK, Cowell also owns media production house and record label Syco, taking a cut from the earnings of every winner of the show.

Stern, meanwhile, has dubbed himself the 'King Of All Media' for his success as a writer, producer and host, and is thought to earn around $15million a year for starring on America's Got Talent.

Ellen DeGeneres (centre left, in white), the chat show host and comic, fell just outside the top five with $70million earnings, despite high-profile gigs such as hosting the 2014 Oscars (pictured) 

Gordon Ramsay earned $47million from his entertainment work in the last 12 months alone, not including the takings from his restaurant empire

While Glenn Beck is less prominent on television screens ever since he quit Fox in 2011, but now charges fans $10-a-month in order to access his online opinion site, The Blaze.

Despite spending 12 years on the air, Dr Phil still ranks high on the list thanks to his ability to track down high-profile interviewees, such as V Stiviano - the girlfriend of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling who recorded him making racist remarks.
