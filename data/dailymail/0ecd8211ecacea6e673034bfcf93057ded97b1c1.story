North Korea's youthful despot Kim Jong Un today made his first visit to the secretive state's latest scientific facility - an institute dedicated to research into grass.

The 29-year-old toured the Turf Institute of the Bioengineering Branch under the State Academy of Sciences in suburban Pyongyang with his usual coterie of generals in tow.

It was the first time the young dictator has been pictured since May Day and comes after North Korea yesterday revealed a few more details about an American just sentenced to 15 years' hard labour.

Pyongyang officials claimed Kenneth Bae entered North Korea with a false identity and rejected speculation that they intend to use his jail sentence as a bargaining chip.

Today though, Kim appeared to put all thoughts of international diplomacy behind him as he walked the corridors and labs of the Turf Institute, which state media described as 'newly constructed by soldiers'.

He 'was pleased to see the green-tiled outer wall' and he 'praised the soldier-builders for erecting the monument to the institute in an imposing manner,' according to translations of local news reports published by the blog North Korea Leadership Watch.

Accompanied by a group of uniformed senior military personnel, but clad in his customary luxuriously tailored baggy suit, Kim toured the institutes exhibition of its accomplishments, its research facilities, study centre and e-library.

He also toured the Turf Institute's greenhouses where various species of grass are cultivated for research, its commissary and its staff quarters.

Don't step on the grass: Kim talks to an 
official in one of the Institute's greenhouses, where research is 
carried out into different varieties of turf. He said it was essential 
to find varieties that are green all year round

Take this down: Kim speaks as his generals take 
note of his decrees. He spoke of 'the need to plant trees, create 
grassland and cultivate flowers and other plants in all lands except the
cultivated land,' KCNA reported

'What is essential in the research into turf is to cultivate turf which remains green all the year round, strong in resistance to cold and treading and high in ornamental effect,' Kim said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.

He also spoke of 'the need to plant 
trees, create grassland and cultivate flowers and other plants in all 
lands except the cultivated land so that there may be no land left waste
or overgrown with weed.'

Kim's words came as Korean-American Kenneth Bae continued to be held in a North Korean jail at the start of his sentence for alleged crimes against the Communist state.

In remarks carried by state media, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman did not specify the Washington state man's crimes but said he confessed.

He said Bae entered North Korea 'with a disguised identity in an intentional way under the back-stage manipulation of the forces hostile toward' the country.

On the straight and narrow: Kim 'was pleased to see the green-tiled outer wall' and 'praised the soldier-builders for erecting the monument to the institute in an imposing manner,' KCNA reported

So you put your hands like this, and push? Kim asks questions about the equipment used at the institute

Let's fo that way! The young despot points into the distance as he wanders out of the institute, perhaps on his way to deal with pressing matters of international diplomacy like the jailing of American Kenneth Bae

Bae, 44, was arrested in early November in Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far north-eastern region bordering China and Russia, according to the North's state media.

Friends say Bae is a devout Christian and tour operator based in China who traveled frequently to North Korea to feed orphans.

Six other Americans have been detained in North Korea since 2009; they eventually were deported or released, some after trips by prominent Americans including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

But the North Korean spokesman dismissed as 'ridiculous and wrong' speculation by foreign media that Pyongyang intends to use Bae as a bargaining chip for another such visit to the country.

He said the 'generosity' the country showed in past cases 'will be of no use in ending Americans' illegal acts.'

North Korea 'has no plan to invite anyone of the U.S. as regards Pae's issue,' the spokesman said.

Pyongyang refers to Bae as Pae Jun Ho, the North Korean spelling for his Korean name.

Bae's sentencing last week came as tension remains on the Korean Peninsula following weeks of warlike rhetoric from Pyongyang and threats to attack the U.S. and South Korea.

The U.S. has called for the North to grant amnesty and immediately release Bae.

The U.S. and North Korea officially remain at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Despite the continuing crisis, thoughts of war appeared to be the back of the North Korean leader's mind today at the Turf Institute where, according to KCNA, he 'underscored the need to turn the country into a socialist thriving nation and make it richer and more beautiful for the people.'
