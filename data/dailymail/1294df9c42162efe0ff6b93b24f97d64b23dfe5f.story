'Ugliest side of Ukip': Gerard Batten, a London MEP and Ukip spokesman on immigration was criticised for comments which 'overlap with the far-Right'

A senior Ukip politician plunged his party into fresh controversy last night after calling on Muslims to sign a special code of conduct to prove they reject violence.

Gerard Batten, a London MEP and the party’s spokesman on immigration, said it was a big mistake for Europe to allow ‘an explosion of mosques across their land’.

The comments will heap further pressure on leader Nigel Farage, who has vowed to rid his party of what he called ‘Walter Mitty’ types.

Last month he was forced to suspend a town councillor who suggested that the country was suffering floods because of David Cameron’s gay marriage policy.

Mr Farage also had to get rid of another MEP, Godfrey Bloom, after he called some women ‘sluts’ and warned against sending aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’.

Last night critics attacked the latest comments from Mr Batten, a member of the party’s executive, saying they represented the ‘ugliest side of Ukip’ and 'overlap with the far-Right'.

The MEP told The Guardian that he stood by his call for a ‘charter of Muslim understanding’, which he first suggested in 2006.

The document asks Muslims to sign a declaration rejecting violence and says that certain parts of the Koran that promote ‘violent physical Jihad’ should be regarded as ‘inapplicable, invalid and non-Islamic’.

Asked on Tuesday about the charter, Mr Batten said he had written it with a friend, who is an Islamic scholar, and could not see why ‘any reasonable, normal person’ would object to signing it.

He also repeated his view that some Muslim texts need updating, claiming some say ‘kill Jews wherever you find them and various things like that’.

‘If that represents the thinking of modern people, there’s something wrong, in which case maybe they need to revise their thinking,’ he said.

‘If they say they cannot revise their thinking on those issues, then who’s got the problem - us or them?’

Asked why Muslims have been singled out, rather than followers of other faiths like Christians or Jews, Mr Batten said: ‘Christians aren’t blowing people up at the moment, are they? Are there any bombs going off round the world which are claimed by Christian organisations? I don’t think so.’

In an interview four years ago, Mr Batten also proposed a ban on new mosques across Europe, suggested Muslim countries should not be ‘appeased’ and warned of the threats of having ‘two incompatible systems living in the same place at the same time’.

Mr Batten is top of the party’s MEP candidate list for London, having passed a round of psychometric testing to make sure his views were acceptable.

He is also a former candidate for London mayor.

Asked yesterday whether he still believed Muslims should sign the charter, Batten said: ‘I don’t suppose the Pope would disagree with it or the Archbishop of Canterbury or anybody else.

‘So why should they feel aggrieved that they might be asked to sign. They don’t have to. If they don’t believe in those five points, they don’t have to sign it.’

In the 2010 interview, Mr Batten suggests a ban on new mosques in ‘our cities’ and warns it was wrong to have allowed so many already.

‘They don’t allow Christian churches or Hindu temples to be built or any kind of non-Muslim place of worship in many of their countries and certainly not in the heartland of their religion,’ he said. ‘Well, if they don’t allow it, why can they expect to see their religion tolerated somewhere else?’

Last night Rehman Chishti, Tory MP for Gillingham and Rainham, said Mr Batten’s position was ‘shocking’.

‘If Nigel Farage had any credibility, he would quite clearly not allow this individual to stand for office in Ukip,’ he said.

Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow London minister, also said he was ‘appalled at the ignorance that Gerard Batten appears to have shown when speaking about the faith that I and hundreds of thousands of British Muslims practice’.

Mary Honeyball, a Labour MEP for London, said Batten ‘represents the ugliest side of Ukip’.

‘Batten’s views overlap with the far-right,’ she said. ‘The idea that Muslims should be singled out in the way he suggests is a relic from a darker, more prejudiced time.’
