Archbishop Desmond Tuttu: He claims Blair and Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction

Archbishop Desmond Tutu has demanded that Tony Blair be tried in The Hague over the invasion of Iraq.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner accused the former Prime Minister of lying about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and said that the 2003 war had left the world  more destabilised and divided than ‘any other conflict in history’.

He said Mr Blair should be subjected to a trial at the International Criminal Court, along with former US president George W. Bush.

The archbishop claimed that the US and UK-led military operation to oust Saddam  created the backdrop for the civil war in Syria and a possible wider Middle East conflict involving Iran.

He said: ‘The then leaders of the United States and Great Britain fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart.

‘They have driven us to the edge of a precipice where we now stand – with the spectre  of Syria and Iran before us.

'The question is not whether Saddam Hussein was good or bad or how many people he massacred, the point is that Mr Bush and Mr Blair should not have allowed themselves to stoop to his immoral level.’

Calling for the pair to face justice in The Hague, he said different standards appeared to be set for prosecuting African leaders, and that the death toll during and after the Iraq conflict was sufficient evidence for them to face action.

‘On these grounds alone, in  a 
consistent world, those responsible should be treading the same path as 
some of their African and Asian peers who have been made to answer for 
their actions in The Hague,’  he said.

Archbishop Tutu, a long-time critic 
of the Iraq war, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for speaking out 
against apartheid in his native South Africa.

Last week he pulled out of a South African conference on leadership because Mr Blair was attending.

In response to the archbishop’s 
remarks, Mr Blair said that it was right to get rid of Saddam because of
 the human rights abuses he perpetrated, and he argued that Iraq was now
 a better place.

He said: ‘I have a great respect for 
Archbishop Tutu’s fight against apartheid – where we were on the same 
side of the argument – but to repeat the old canard that we lied about 
the intelligence is completely wrong, as every single independent 
analysis of the evidence has shown.

‘And to say the fact that Saddam 
massacred hundreds of thousands of his citizens is irrelevant to the 
morality of removing him is bizarre.’

He added: ‘I would also point out 
that despite the problems, Iraq today has an economy three times or more
 in size with child mortality rate cut by a third of what it was. And 
with investment hugely increased in places such as Basra.’

Yesterday, former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell declined to back Archbishop Tutu’s call for a Hague trial.

He said: ‘When any question of crime 
is discussed in any jurisdiction, you have to ask yourself whether an 
act was committed and whether that act was committed with criminal 
intent.

'Although I believe that George W Bush and Tony Blair were wrong ...  I don’t believe they did so with any malign intention.’
