A cruel care worker at a private hospital exposed on television for its abuse of patients forced two to attack each other and had hurt them herself because she said they 'loved pain'.

Alison Dove, 25, was caught on video placing people she was meant to care for in a dark room before telling them to 'fight it out'.

Dove’s inhumanity was secretly filmed by a BBC Panorama investigation at 
Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol by reporter Joe Casey.

On film Dove is asked if both patients can be left in the room together and
she replies that it is safe 'as long as someone’s watching,' adding 'I was like "fight" and they were both just going [makes a punching swing] and that’s when it gets interesting.'

The shocking footage was shown at the city's crown court today as she is the first of 11 staff at the care home prepare to be sentenced for their terrible abuse of residents.

Michael Ezenagu, 28, Wayne
Rogers, 31, Graham Doyle, 25, Allison Dove, 24, Jason Gardiner, 
42, Charlotte Cotterell, 21, Holly Draper, 22, Kelvin Fore, 32, Sookalingun Appoo, 58, Danny Brake,
26, and Neil Ferguson, 28, have all previously admitted neglect and abuse offences.

Bristol Crown Court heard that innocent Simone Blake, Simon Tovey, Louise Bissett, Louisa Deville and Lorraine Guildford suffered greatly at the hands of the defendants.

In the dock: The group of care home workers who are being sentenced after they were caught on camera abusing patients by an undercover TV investigation

Graham Doyle, 25, another carer at the home, verbally berated patients 
by putting on a German accent 'like a Nazi solider', the court heard.

Dove was appearing at court to be sentenced for the horrifying abuse alongside fellow carer Doyle.

Other footage shown to the court featured Doyle physically and verbally restraining patients.

Prosecutor Kerry Barker said: ‘In one instance he uses the phrase 'nein, nein, nein' as if he were a Nazi soldier.'

Inquiry: Panorama filmed residents at Winterbourne View being assaulted and bullied. This poor woman was dragged across the floor

Disgusting: Staff played games with the patients, shown here placing one person under furniture with the other sat in the seat above

Horrific: This member of staff stamps on the patients hand in yet another shocking image from the now-closed home

The video shows Dove helping pin Simone to the floor, force feed her medicine and squirt shower gel in her eyes.

Eventually a visibly distressed Simone starts to choke and is sick, forcing the workers to leave her.

At one point Simone can be heard to cry out to her mum and screams 'I’m cold mum, I’m cold'.

The video shown to the court featured another patient Louisa Deville 
warning Simone that Dove will place her in a cold shower fully clothed.

Lousia is heard saying: 'Simmie, don’t mess with Alli [Dove] or she will
put you in the shower again. Yes she will put you in the shower.'

Dove, referring to Miss Blake, was also heard on film to say: 'She loves pain, doesn’t she? She thinks it’s funny.'

She then told Miss Blake: 'Simone, come here and I’ll punch your face.'

Winterbourne View: Staff at the residential care home waged a campaign of cruelty against vulnerable patients which was exposed by a BBC Panorama investigation

The footage was played at the court where Dove and Doyle have already 
pleaded guilty to physically and verbally assaulting patients.

Winterbourne was closed after five weeks of undercover filming captured shocking treatment of disabled people.

Defending the two workers, Virigina Cornwall and Charles Rowe said that 
both staff members had been severely let down by Castlebeck, the company
who ran Winterbourne View.

Miss Cornwall, for Dove, said the environment the worker had found 
herself meant that the practices and behaviours became normal and 
embedded.

She said: 'The working environment doesn’t excuse what she did but it 
does provide the context. It was in this vacuum of supervision that she 
learnt these practices that became normal.

'She didn’t recognise herself. She didn’t set out to hurt anyone emotionally or physically.'

Punishment: A judge will sentence the group of 11 care home workers later this week

She added that since the Pamorama investigation had been aired Dove had 
been subject to physical abuse and suffered a broken jaw and a hateful 
Facebook campaign.

Mr Rowe said that Doyle also had deep regret for what he had done.

He said: 'He describes the behaviour as disgusting and vile and makes no
excuses. He knows he will have to live with what he did.

'When he watched the DVD he was emotional and described it as shocking, outrageous and totally unacceptable.'

'It is obvious there was an institutional failure and genuine chaos.

Other former staff have already appeared in court with more due tomorrow. They will be sentenced together later in the week.
