A New Yoker who sued after his real name and address were broadcast on MTV's 'True Life: I'm a Chubby Chaser' has been told he has fat chance of seeing a penny.

Tristan Watson and roommate Nadine Crosbie brought a lawsuit against the reality show's producers last year.

The couple claimed that they were duped into thinking their home address would not be shown and that Watson would only be identified by the name 'Tee' on the show.

Duped: Tristan Watson (pictured) and his roommate Nadine Crosbie filed suit against the reality show's producers last year, saying the show tricked them into thinking Watson's full name wouldn't be used and their home address wouldn't be shown

Thrown out: A Manhattan Supreme Court judge tossed the suit, finding the pair's agreement with the producers didn't contain any of those guarantees

A  'Chubby Chaser' is person of any sexuality who is attracted to another person who is overweight.

For a certain subset of the male population — referred to in the scientific community as 'fat admirers' — overweight women are the ideal.

A recent study, published in The Journal of Sex Research, finds that not only do FAs prefer overweight women, but that they also find a wider range of body sizes attractive than other men do.

The program focused on people who intentionally seek out extra-plump partners.

According to the lawsuit, Watson complained that despite verbal assurances and an email from a producer in 2011 telling him not to worry, his full first name was used on air.

During an internet broadcast in 2012, the show didn't do anything to conceal the location of the couples New York home.

Their 'address and apartment number were clearly, identifiably displayed,' the suit said.

Mr Chubby Chaser: The True Life"episode was about people who like to date other people generally considered to be very overweight. Watson's segment was about his relationship and his cousin's disapproval of it

Greivance: After the show aired, Watson said that he received threatening letters and experienced employment troubles. He said that he negotiated for months before agreeing to be on the show to make sure that he'd be protected

The problem was made worse for Watson and Crosbie after his cousin also appeared on the show.

The couple claim that after the show broadcast the pair were harassed and got death threats.

'Since the premiere of the episode, plaintiffs have been repeatedly harassed at their home,' with Watson having a death threat 'slipped under the front of his door of his apartment,' the suit said.

The show's producers said Watson and Crosbie didn't have a leg to stand on after they signed a release allowing their likenesses to be used and filming to be done at their home.

Fat chance: Judge Marcy Friedman of the New York State Supreme Court granted MTV¿s motion to dismiss the complaint, finding no legal evidence to support Tristan Watson¿s claim that the show's productio caused him undue pain and hardship

No cause for complain: The couple participated in the show for about a year before the piece was finally aired

In an affidavit, Watson said that after the menacing warnings, 'I no longer felt safe leaving my apartment and I lost my job as a result.'

The pair brought a lawsuit against MTV and the show's producers for $2.5 million, charging them with fraud, breach of contract and negligence. but The show's producers said Watson and Crosbie had voluntarily agreed to appear on the show.

They also agreed not to sue for any reason.

MTV's filing noted the pair had participated in the show for 'nearly a year' before it aired.

In a ruling earlier this month, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Marcy Friedman threw the suit out.

The judge ruled that the producers didn't breach any of the guarantees they had already promised to the couple.
