Missing: Candice Shields was last seen the evening of December 10 at her Texas home

Police in Graham, Texas are investigating the disappearance of 20-year-old pregnant mother who disappeared last month.

Candice Shields was last seen the night of December 10 at the home she shares with her grandparents.

Investigators say they have no evidence indicating foul play in the case but are calling her disappearance 'unusual'.

Ms Shields, who has a one-year-old 
son, Christopher, and is four months pregnant with her second child, was reported 
missing by her family on December 15 at 1:18pm.

According to Fox News, police say her
cellphone records indicate her phone was used to make a call from the 
home at around 2:30am on December 11. 

The phone and all of Ms Shields' belongings were left behind at the residence.

According to Ms Shields' Facebook page, she did not own a car, and police say she had no known mode of transportation.

At 3:15 the morning of December 10, she asked for help on the social networking website finding a vehicle to get to a new job.

Her last message, at 1:38am on December 11, she wrote cryptically, 'idk [I don't know] wat [what] to do anymore.'

Jeremy Thornburg, who is listed on Ms
Shields' Facebook page as her boyfriend, posted a message on the site 
on December 12 at 12:18am alerting friends to her disappearance.

'well FB [Facebook] im really worried
and stressing out because today i found out my girlfriend and future 
mother of my child has disappeared and no one has heard from her,' he 
wrote, adding: 'i just have to stay positive and hope for the best if 
anyone knows anything of her where abouts please inform me or her
