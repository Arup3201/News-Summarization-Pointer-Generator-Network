Steve Jobs’ liver transplant surgeon is under renewed ethical scrutiny after it was revealed he lived in the billionaire’s Memphis recovery home for two years while Jobs’ attorney paid the bills.

Dr. James Eason moved into Jobs’ recovery home soon after performing his surgery in 2009 and then purchased it for himself in 2011 shortly before his patient’s death.

Eason has batted off questions about his relationship with Jobs before—and about how the California billionaire so quickly snagged a precious organ in Tennessee—but these new revelations have put the ethical spotlight back on the renowned transplant surgeon.

Scrutiny: Dr. James Eason helped extend Steve Jobs' life by over two years with a 2009 liver transplant, but the surgeon's friendship with the billionaire is under renewed scrutiny years later

‘It strikes me as a potential conflict of interest,’ NYU bioethicist Arthur Caplan told Memphis’s Commercial Appeal. ‘It strikes me as straining ethical credulity to have him there saying, “Well, you know, I just lived here. I was just lucky. And this guy just chose to pay my rent."’

A call made to Eason's office was forwarded to Jeff Moder, a spokesperson for Methodist Healthcare, the hospital where Eason works.

'We don't have anything to add at this time,' was Moder's only comment on a story he said has already been covered at length.

However, Moder declined to comment on behalf of Eason or the hospital as to whether the surgeon was paying rent over the course of the two years he lived in the 13-room home.

Meanwhile, it seems clear that he did not personally pay the utility bills or property taxes during those years.

The home was owned by a limited 
liability company set up by jobs’ attorneys. The bills were paid for 
personally by Jobs’ San Francisco lawyer George Riley.

According
to the New York Post, Riley used his credit card to pay $8,770 in 
utility bills for the home between May 2010 and 2011.

Riley wrote personal checks amounting to $23,585 for property taxes on the home between 2009 and May 2011.

Recovery house: This 13-room Memphis home is again at the center of debate about Eason, who has now been revealed to have lived in the home for two years while Jobs' attorney paid some of the bills

That’s when Eason purchased the home for $850,000, the same price Jobs paid in 2009.

While appearing before a meeting of the Shelby County Commission for an unrelated matter, Eason was asked how he came to purchase the home.

‘It’s a fair question,’ Eason said. ‘When I learned that it was going to be going on the market, I asked the administrator of the LLC if I could purchase it.’

But his succinct answer failed to address the years he’d lived in the home before purchasing it. It also glossed over the years of bioethical intrigue that followed Jobs’ transplant.

According to the Commercial Appeal, Eason was going through a divorce when he moved into the home part-time in 2009 while also trying to patch things up with his wife.

'Close friend': Following his transplant, Jobs recovered in the Memphis home. Some question Eason's relationship with Jobs--who quickly got a new liver after being listed at Eason's Tennessee hospital--now that its been revealed that Eason also lived there

Multiple listing is when a transplant patient lists his or her name at multiple hospitals.

The method allows patients to be eligible for organs in areas outside the regions where they live.

Hospitals tend to look at factors like bank accounts, home life, and support systems when deciding who gets precious organs.

This means that mostly just wealthy individuals are able to qualify for transplant lists outside where they live.

Jobs had enough money to buy a home in Memphis in which to recover and to quickly fly there when a liver became available.

'And then, in 2010, sometime in spring of 2010, I moved in there and stayed there until I purchased the house. And live there now,' Eason said.

While most Americans waiting for transplants do so near their homes and families, those patients with more money and mobility are able to cast a far greater net when searching for an organ.

The process is called multiple listing and it gives patients—who are rich more often than not—a greatly increased chance to get a life-saving transplant.

Because he had the means to travel and be taken care of outside of his California residence, hospitals outside his place of residence were willing to place him on their transplant lists.

While Jobs may have died waiting for a liver in densely populated California, where many were ahead of him on the transplant list, he quickly made it to the front of the line in less populous Tennessee.

Eason has addressed Jobs’ luck in the past.

‘He was the top person on that list that day, because he was the sickest person on the list that day,’ Eason said in a statement shortly after news of Jobs’ transplant emerged in 2009.

While ethicists and sick patients without Jobs’ money may question the fairness of multiple listing, it is legal.

And other patients of Dr. Eason’s might question his relationship with Jobs. According to the Commercial Appeal, the doctor went above and beyond the typical level of care offered to most patients: coordinating his recovery and continued cancer tests, pain treatment, and nutrition.

Eason even reportedly ran errands for Jobs and took him on walks in the park.

While such intimacy has lent itself to questions about possible preferential treatment given to the billionaire, for his part Eason says they were just friends.

‘We developed a close friendship. And we treated each other like you would do any other friend,’ Eason told the Commercial Appeal. ‘He was a friend helping me out. And I was, you know, looking after the house for him.’
