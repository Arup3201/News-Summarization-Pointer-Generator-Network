Families threw away mountains of good food over Christmas amid complaints supermarkets continue to encourage people to buy too much.

One in five people threw away or wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over Christmas and New Year, according to a new study.

Tonnes of fresh vegetables and salad, mince pies and turkey were piled into bins after they went off before they could be eaten.

A new study has found that one in five people wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over the festive period

Families blamed supermarket promotions for over-indulging on food purchases they could not eat.

Some 70 per cent said supermarkets urged them to increase their food purchasing over the festive season – with 45 per cent saying they did buy more.

Seventy-two per cent of shoppers said they were tempted by Buy-One-Get-One-Free Offers(BOGOFS), while 70 per cent said they bought extra because of half-price deals.

More than a third named discounts such as vouchers, money off single items and loyalty card offers as other routes to increased and often unnecessary buying.

The study was commissioned by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and comes one year after it published a major study -  Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not – estimating that between 30 to 50per cent of all food produced is never eaten.

Dr Tim Fox, Head of Energy and Environment at the Institution, said: ‘This latest survey shows that UK shoppers still feel they are encouraged to buy too much food, despite significant progress on raising awareness of food waste in 2013, and some retailer action to reduce over-purchasing.

Seventy-two per cent of respondents said they were tempted by Buy One Get One Free deals, while 70 per cent said they had bought extra because of the deals

‘There are various reasons why around a third to a half of all food produced in the world never reaches a human stomach, and while it would be wrong to lay all of the blame for waste with the supermarkets - deals like Buy-One-Get-One-Free, “half price” offers and various other price discounting methods do exacerbate the problem.’

He said: ‘It is certainly a concern that over a fifth of the people surveyed said they had thrown away more than 10per cent of the food they bought over the festive period.

‘This food could be used to help feed those in hunger today, and is also an unnecessary waste of the considerable land, water and energy resources that were used in the production, processing and distribution of this food - resources that could be used to meet other human needs.

‘If we are to have a sustainable future on a planet with over nine billion people on board it is important that everybody, from the Government and retailers through to consumers at home, tries to reduce the amount of food that is wasted and thinks about the land, water and energy resources involved in bringing food to the plate.’

The survey of 2,023 people found that the older generation threw less food away. Some 45per cent of over 65s said they did not waste or throw away any of the food, which compares to just a third of those aged 18-24.

The Institution said the world produces about four billion metric tonnes of food per year, but between a third and a half of this is wasted through poor practices and inadequate infrastructure.

The study, Global Good; Waste Not Want Not estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of all food produced is never eaten. File picture

The group said it would be possible to feed the world’s growing population without the need to increase production greatly, if more of the food that is produced was eaten rather than wasted.

Supermarkets have attempted to shift the blame for food waste from themselves to customers.

A senior executive at Tesco caused controversy in December by suggesting that fussy customers, who were unwilling to buy misshapen or blemished fresh produce, were to blame.

Matt Simister, food sourcing director at Tesco, told a House of Lords inquiry, that customers will also select the freshest and best looking fruit and vegetables.

He said: ‘Customers naturally select, they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left.

‘Then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old, ugly misshapen produce goes to waste.

‘Customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better. That’s a very difficult reality to us.’

In October, Tesco revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year.

It found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes.

Much of the food was thrown away by customers but large amounts were lost because they have been on display for too long.

The supermarket subsequently scrapped confusing ‘display until’ dates on fresh fruit and vegetables, and ended buy one get one free offers on salads.

Research by the Waste and Resources Action Programme suggests families waste £60 a month by throwing the equivalent of almost a meal a day into the bin. It said a staggering £12.5billion worth of food is wasted annually.
