When President Obama announced the landmark deal with Iran, he included some points that the Islamic republic says it never agreed to

Iranian officials claimed on Tuesday that the Obama administration concocted a fact sheet on a landmark nuclear agreement that doesn't match what they endorsed over the weekend.

Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham said the version of the pact released by the White House 'is a one-sided interpretation of the agreed text in Geneva and some of the explanations and words in the sheet contradict the text of the Joint Plan of Action.'

At issue are several differences between the White House's summary of the accord and the plain text of the agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other industrialized nations – specifically the administration's claim that Iran has agreed to stop enriching uranium for the next six months.

On Saturday evening the White House said in a statement that Western nations and Iran had 'reached a set of initial understandings that halts the progress of Iran's nuclear program and rolls it back in key respects.'

President Obama delivered an address 17 minutes later, announcing that under the agreement, 'Iran cannot use its next-generation centrifuges, which are used for enriching uranium.'

He also said the Islamic republic 'will halt work at its plutonium reactor.'

On Tuesday Iran released what it says is the actual agreement, and insisted it had made no such commitments.

Awkward: Secretary of State John Kerry shook hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday, and less than a day later the two were squabbling over the terms of the Geneva agreement

The talks in Switzerland included Iran, Germany and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France

'This agreement that has just been signed mentions that Iran is fully entitled to the right of enrichment and it will never quit its rights in the future,' Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the following day in Geneva.

He said Wednesday that the White House misrepresented the Geneva negotiations. 'They released that fact sheet because they wanted to make their desired changes in it,' he told Iran's parliament in a closed briefing.

On Tuesday Abbas Araqchi, Iran's top nuclear negotiator told Trend magazine in Azerbaijan that 'Iran's uranium enrichment right cannot be granted or limited by another countries.'

And Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, insisted on Monday that the Geneva accord won't affect operations at his nation’s major nuclear sites.

'Work at the Arak reactor will continue,' Salehi said. '[Uranium] enrichment to 5 percent will continue. Research and development will continue. All our exploration and extraction activities will continue. There are no activities that won’t continue."

He announced on Tuesday that Iran's enrichment program will actually increase, and added that construction of the heavy-water reactor at Arak – which the U.S. believes is one component of a plutonium production facility – will continue as before.

Iranian Atomic Energy Organization president Ali Akbar Salehi said 'work at the Arak [nuclear] reactor will continue,' meaning Iran is likely committed to producing plutonium for military purposes

Not impressed: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the nuclear agreement with Iran as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within Tehran's reach

Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday that 'there is no right to enrich' uranium in the Geneva agreement. 'We do not recognize a right to enrich.'

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani began distancing himself from the White House almost immediately, saying that 'our [uranium] enrichment activities will continue as before'

But the Obama administration is now suggesting that differences in interpretation are moot since the interim agreement is just one step along a path toward a permanent arrangement that would curb Iran's nuclear program in the long run.

'Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told MailOnline.

Asked to react to Iran's claim that the White House changed key elements of the agreement for public consumption, she said 'I don’t have any particular response to these reports.'

But she acknowledged that 'domestic enrichment' would likely be part of 'a limited, tightly constrained and intensively monitored civilian nuclear program' that the West would negotiate with Iran over the next six months.

In exchange for Iran's now-disputed concessions, the U.S. has agreed to release as much as $7 billion in capital that was previously part of crippling economic sanctions, largely in the form of oil revenue..

The White House's fact sheet – the same one Iran now calls illegitimate – said it would also lift 'certain sanctions on gold and precious metals, Iran’s auto sector, and Iran’s petrochemical exports.'
