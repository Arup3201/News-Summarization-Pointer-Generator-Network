Crack down on crime: Nick Clegg, speaking today, said he wanted criminals to come face to face with victims in the communities affected across Britain

Nick Clegg today called for convicted 
rioters to be forced to wear orange jumpsuits and clean up the neighbourhoods they looted.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he wanted criminals to come face to face with victims in the communities affected across Britain.

Theresa May also spoke this morning about policing during the riots, repeating comments from last week that the initial response was 'unsatisfactory'.

The Home Secretary said: 'The events of the past ten days show police reforms are more urgent than ever.'

Her comments came as West Midlands Chief Constable said some of the young people arrested after riots in Birmingham 'have led difficult lives and should be shown compassion'.

This morning also saw the Prime Minister visiting Tottenham, where riots erupted last week .

Earlier, at a press conference in Whitehall, Mr Clegg said an independent communities and victims panel would allow people 'to have their voice heard'.

The Liberal Democrat leader said research would be done to find out 'what happened, who did what and why they did it'.

He said: 'It is really important at a time like this that we should not allow hope and optimism to be suffocated by fear and pessimism.'

Scotland Yard thwarted planned attacks by rioters on iconic sites across London hours before they were due to happen after officers 'break into' encrypted social messaging sites, the Guardian reported.

Attacks on the Olympics site, upmarket stores in Oxford circus and the two Westfield shopping centres in East and West London were plotted using BlackBerry Messenger.

After scouring the mobile phones of people who had been arrested during the riots they discovered the messages which were bouncing around the heavily encrypted BlackBerry Messenger service.

By last Monday they were able to monitor BlackBerry messaging.

Police had considered switching off social messaging sites, including BlackBerry Messenger and Twitter.

But acting Metropolitan police commissioner, Tim Godwin, said they did not have the legal powers to do so.

BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) says it will co-operate with the police investigation into claims that its virtually untraceable instant BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) service was used to plot the riots.

It would not confirm that it possesses an electronic ‘master key’ that could decode messages and reveal users' identities.

Twitter has refused to say whether it is helping police to locate those who used its service to co-ordinate the riots.

Mr Clegg also confirmed plans for a 'riot pay-back scheme', with offenders helping to clean up areas hit by the disturbances.

Victims
will also be given the right to confront those who tore up their local 
area, with additional money provided to make that possible.

Mr Clegg said: 'In every single one of 
the communities affected there will be community pay-back schemes, riot 
pay-back schemes, where you will see people in visible orange clothing 
making up for the damage done, repairing and improving the neighbourhoods 
affected.

'I also want them to face their victims. I want them to face people like the woman I met last week in Tottenham, who said to me that she was still wearing the clothes ... from when her own flat was burned down.

'The offender who did that, who set fire to that building, should have to face her and understand that there are human consequences, to explain why he or she did what they did and to apologise.'

As part of the measures to end the 'dismal cycle of repeat crime', Mr Clegg also said that those released from jail from March next year would be 'met at the prison gates' by providers in the Work Programme.

The offenders will be put through a 'tough process so that they find work and they stay on the straight and narrow'.

Mr Clegg acknowledged the need to look again at how authorities were tackling gang culture.

He said: 'I don't think anyone could have witnessed last week's events and somehow been complacent about gang culture.

'There does seem to be some early 
evidence that in some areas there was a very strong gang element and 
there is even some anecdotal evidence that gangs were co-operating to 
maximise their looting opportunities.

Thirty officers and sniffer dogs swooped on an address in Hackney today where two more teenagers were arrested in connection with last week's riots.

'Of course we need to look at that and that is why I think it is right that we revisit our positions on gang culture.'

West Midlands Chief Constable Chris Sims told a special city council meeting he had spoken to several of the youngsters detained after last week's violent scenes.

He said: 'I spent Saturday evening in
the custody block at Steelhouse Lane Police Station. There are tragic 
offenders as well as tragic victims.

'Young
people who have been in care for most of their lives. We need to show 
some compassion and be pragmatic about how we deal with these people.'

Opposition
Labour councillors said they would launch a probe into the underlying 
conditions of high unemployment, poor housing and a lack of education, 
thought to result in many young people feeling that they have no future.

Meanwhile,
the Prime Minister toured a leisure centre in Tottenham, North London, 
which was providing food and clothing for people made homeless by the 
fires. He also visited a local fire station.

Mr Cameron told firefighters: 'I 
wanted to hear first-hand about some of the things you experienced, and 
some of the things we need to learn from it.

'Debt of gratitude': Theresa May spoke today of her admiration at how the police had quelled the violence - but admitted the initial response to the riots was 'unsatisfactory'

'It was an incredibly challenging situation, perhaps particularly here in Tottenham.

'I've been all over the country hearing about what happened, but this is where things started.

'It was complicated and made difficult by the tragic killing of Mark Duggan - it's been a difficult situation.'

The Tory leader also spoke to some of
the 50 families made homeless by the rioting, when flats were burned 
during attacks on shops.

The
shooting of Mr Duggan, 29, by police near Tottenham Hale station, which
is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, 
was the spark which set off the riots in the area two days later.

Home
Secretary Theresa May held a news conference this morning about the 
police response to last week's riots and looting across the UK.

She said that new curfew powers for police need to be considered in the wake of the riots.

Officers should also be given clearer guidance on public order policing, including the possibility of setting up no-go areas.

She said: 'Under existing laws, there is no power to impose a general curfew in a particular area, and, while curfew conditions can be placed on some offenders as part of their Asbo, criminal sentence or bail conditions, there are only limited powers to impose them on somebody under the age of 16.

'These are the sort of changes we need to consider.'

Mrs May rejected calls from senior officers to reconsider the Government's 20 per cent cuts to police budgets in the wake of the riots, saying the disturbances of the past ten days showed the reforms were now more urgent than ever.

She said: 'I am clear that, even at the end of this spending period, forces will still have the resources to deploy officers in the same numbers we have seen in the last week.

'It's clear to me that we can improve the visibility and availability of the police to the public.

'It's more important than ever that we do so, because we are asking the police to fight crime on a tighter budget.'

Ed Miliband criticised the Home Secretary's plan to press on with police cuts, saying it left him 'very worried'.

The Labour leader was on a visit to Bristol, where he met members of the community affected by rioting last week.

He said: 'It is right that we learn lessons from the policing of the riots, but the most important thing the Government can do is learn lessons itself.

'The lesson the public wants them to learn is that visible effective policing increases public confidence and increases safety on our streets. That is why they should rethink their police cuts.'
