Faced with the possibility that Congress may not come to an agreement to fund the Department of Homeland Security by Friday midnight, President Barack Obama on Monday warned a group of governors on Monday that temporarily shuttering the government agency's doors 'will have a direct impact on America’s national security.'

And over the weekend while speaking at a briefing during the National Governors Association meeting, Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson cautioned that 'we are greatly compromised' by a shutdown.  

Separately, the Justice Department argued on Monday that the country could face 'irreparable harm' if a Texas judge's injunction on the presidents immigration orders were kept in effect.

But the White House on Monday afternoon had a tough time detailing specific aspects of national security that would be threatened if either situation came to pass.

With regards to Congress, the president said Monday that if the legislative branch doesn't send him a bill he can sign, more than 100,000 DHS employees, including Border Patrol agents, port inspectors, and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents 'will show up to work without getting paid.'

Characterizing the dispute as another one of the 'manufactured crises and self-inflicted wounds' imposed by Congress 'that have so often bogged us down over the last five years,' Obama told governors on Monday that workers are 'not going to be able to spend that money in your states' if they don't receive a paycheck.

'It will have a direct impact on your economy, and it will have a direct impact on America’s national security, because their hard work helps to keep us safe.

'And as governors, you know that we can’t afford to play politics with our national security,' he told them.

Congressional Republicans are holding up funding for the Department of Homeland Security over the president's November directive to the agency to stop deporting more than 4 million non-violent illegal immigrants who meet certain criteria.

The House has passed legislation to give DHS the money to continue operations - but only if doesn't enforce Obama's mandate.

Democrats have blocked the bill from proceeding through the Senate multiple times. They again filibustered the legislation on Monday evening.

The White House has said it would veto legislation that undermines the president's executive actions on immigration, anyway, putting another hurdle in the way of the GOP-backed bill.

If the House and Senate do not pass identical legislation by a Feb. 28, a legally-mandated deadline imposed by Congress last December, or the White House doesn't approve the bill they come up with, DHS will partially shut down. All employees who are deemed non-essential will be sent home, and those that are seen as essential will be kept on the job without pay until the conflict is resolved.

Politico reports that a DHS shutdown would have the immediate effect of 30,000 employees being sent home without pay. The news publication put the number of employees who would have to stay on - even though they won't be paid for that work until a later date - at 200,000. 

Asked by Daily Mail Online on Monday afternoon what 'direct impact' a DHS shutdown would have on national security, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'is that people who will be showing up to protect our borders, to protect our ports of entry including our airports, individuals who are responsible for keeping the machinery moving in terms of responding to natural disasters, and responding to requests for assistance from states when they put forward requests for financial assistance, that those kind of day-to-day operations are affected.'

'In some cases it just means that there is personnel who are not receiving paychecks. In some cases we're talking about personnel who are working on these important matters who are being furloughed,' he contended.

He later told another reporter that just because some employees are categorized as non-essential, doesn't mean they really are.  

These may not be people who are 'instantly recognizable to the American public,' he said, but they do play an important role in protecting our Homeland Security.

In his response to Daily Mail Online, Earnest said national security would also be threatened because DHS' ability 'to plan for the future and to implement new procedures and programs' would be negatively impacted.

Cyber security could also be threatened, Earnest said, as that issue falls primarily under DHS's domain.

'I think it's very hard for anybody to make the case – and I don't think anybody really has – that stopping funding for the Department of Homeland Security somehow enhances our national security,' he told Daily Mail Online during his daily briefing.

'And I think everybody would acknowledge that it's going to have an impact and it's not going to be a positive one,' which is why Congress should fully fund DHS for the full fiscal year, he added. 

At a press conference on Monday Johnson argued that cutting headquarters staff 'back to a skeleton' would inhibit DHS' 'ability to stay on top of a lot of the existing situations and challenges to homeland security right now.' 

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, joined by the department employees, said Monday that Congress to pass a full-year appropriations bill for DHS. Failing to fund DHS impacts our personnel and their families, he said in addition to national security

Regardless of whether Homeland Security remains fully up and running it cannot legally set to work on implementing Obama's mandates at present, because a judge in Texas last week granted 26 states - many of whom's governors participated in White House-sponsored events held in conjunction with the NGA meeting this weekend - seeking a reprieve a preliminary injunction that Homeland Security has said it will abide by.

The Department of Justice on Monday requested a stay from the judge, Andrew Hanen of Brownsville, Texas, while it appeals his decision. 

Hannen, a Republican-appointed judge, is not expected to cede the Obama administration's request. In his earlier decision he said he believes the plaintiffs, Texas specifically, would 'suffer irreparable harm in this case' if Obama's executive actions were allowed to take effect.

The Department of Justice said Monday it believes that not allowing the DHS to proceed with its plans to place illegal immigrants who apply for the proposed programs under review would cause 'irreparable harm' not only to those people but to national security.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Monday, 'The administration believes that a stay should be granted because the judge's ruling in this case only makes it harder for the Department of Homeland Security to protect the American people and bring much needed accountability to our nation's immigration system.'

He argued that measures Obama put in place 'would bring greater accountability to our immigration system' because they 'would bring millions of people out of the shadows,' force them to pay taxes and to go through background checks. 

And that, he said, would make the country safer.
