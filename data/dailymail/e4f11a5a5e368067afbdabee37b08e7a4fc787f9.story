Southampton manager Ronald Koeman believed luck was on team's side at Old Trafford after Dusan Tadic struck the winner with the only shot on target in the entire match. 

It was the first time Manchester United failed to fire a single shot on target at home since May 2009 and Koeman believed the theme of Sunday's game was very similar to his side's previous meeting with Louis van Gaal's men earlier this season.

The Saints had the better chances in the corresponding fixture at St Mary's at the beginning of December but two Robin van Persie goals, against the run of play, secured a 2-1 win for United despite Koeman's men dominating the match for long periods.

'Mata had two or three good chances to score, but we had some luck,' Koeman told Sky Sports. 

'So it's a draw, United were the lucky team then (in December) but maybe us today.'

The Dutchman was thrilled with his back four's display, marshalled superbly by man of the match Jose Fonte, as they nullified United's attacking game for the duration of the contest. 

'It's three points at Old Trafford. That's fantastic. It says a lot about our ambitions,' Koeman added.

'The movement of Rooney caused us problems, but they didn't create a lot of opportunities.'

Koeman's side have beaten Arsenal, drawn with Chelsea and taken all three points against United in their last three games and now sit third in the Premier League standings. 

'Again today, we showed we can win the big ones,' said the Saints boss. 'The belief was in our team today. We had that feeling against Chelsea and against Arsenal.'

Meanwhile, United boss Louis van Gaal was disappointed with Southampton's tactics during the contest and felt they were rewarded for their negative approach. 

'They came for a draw and they go away with victory which was disappointing,' said Van Gaal. 

'They defended really well. We dominated the game without creating enough chances.'
