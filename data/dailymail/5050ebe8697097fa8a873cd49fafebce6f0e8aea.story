Influence? It has been unveiled that the Prince of Wales's staff have been working in key government departments

Prince Charles has been accused of planting 'moles' in the heart of government after it emerged members of his staff had been working full-time in Whitehall departments.

One of his employees was seconded to a policy team at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for around a year.

Another aide working for the heir to the throne spent two years at the Cabinet Office, which deals with cross-cutting issues across the whole of government and is based next to Number 10.

A third was based there for six weeks.

The allegations sparked further allegations that the Prince of Wales was meddling in government and abandoning the traditional of royal neutrality in politics - with one MP describing him as a 'constitutional crisis in waiting'.

The Sunday Times, which exposed the existence of the seconded staff, said that some current and former ministers in the two departments knew nothing of the appointments.

The revelations come a week after the Mail disclosed that the Prince of Wales has had 36 private audiences with Cabinet ministers since the election - one a month.

Alongside seven meetings with the Prime Minister, he also met a disproportionately high number of ministers from departments representing issues of personal interest to him, including the environment, alternative medicine and town planning.

It raised questions over whether the Prince was lobbying for his pet issues.

But Clarence House robustly defended the summits, saying it was his right and duty to meet any minister 'he chooses'. They also said some meetings were requested by the ministers rather than the Prince.

And last night they defended the presence of the prince's staff in government, denying claims that the secondees were doing the Prince's work in government.

A spokeswoman said the three secondees
were junior members of staff, aged in their 20s, who would not have 
come into contact with the Prince very often.

She
pointed out that the staff made their own requests for experience in 
government departments for their own professional development reasons.

Prince Charles has a keen interest in rural affairs and the environment

Labour MP Paul Flynn, member of the Commons public administration committee, said news of the secondments suggested the prince was a 'constitutional crisis in waiting'.

'Planting his civil service moles proves an intention to abandon royal political neutrality,' he said.

'He clearly doesn't accept the principle of an independent and politically neutral monarchy. I am astonished that he should have had his people in the civil service in this way with ministers not even being aware they were there.

'Constitutional monarchs should be above politics. What is he doing except to advance his own agenda? It's outrageous.'

Paul Farrelly, another Labour backbencher, said the House of Commons needed an explanation as to why this had been allowed to happen.

'It raises constitutional questions about the influence the monarch-in-waiting has over policy and there will be questions in the House when it returns,' he said.

It is not the first time concerns have been raised over the Prince's influence on the political process

Yesterday one minister in one of the two departments affected said he had no idea that a member of the Prince's staff was working there - and demanded to know if they had any influence on policy.

He told the Sunday Times it was 'undemocratic' and said: 'There are urgent questions that need to be answered about who agreed it.

'It raises questions about whether Prince Charles is exceeding his position as constitutional monarch in waiting. There is a question about what they are doing and whether they are influencing policy.'

Later this year, the public administration committee will conduct an investigation into the Prince's constitutional position which means ministers have been forced to seek his permission to pass at least a dozen government bills.

The committee will ask whether there is a risk that the requirement of royal consent 'could be seen as politicising the monarchy'.

A spokeswoman for Clarence House would not provide the identities of the secondees or say what tasks they had undertaken. She said staff from departments such as the Foreign Office are often seconded with the Prince of Wales's office.

'We have had two secondments to government departments in the past two years,' she said. 'The secondments were suggested on the basis of professional development and the paperwork was arranged by the relevant HR departments.

'One secondment was one year and the other was for two years. Both have some to a natural conclusion. There was no official feedback mechanism and no regular meetings were attended with the Prince of Wales's household.

'The secondments were on a like-for-like basis. One secondee has now left Clarence House and the other is due to return shortly after a sabbatical.

'Over the past five years, in addition to the two secondments already discussed, there has been one other secondment, for six weeks to the Cabinet Office. We have no new secondments planned at present.'

Defra said the Prince's aide was not involved in any issues related to the Duchy of Cornwall, his landholding from which he made £19million last year.
