Frank McParland is enjoying his new role as director of football at Brentford

'I always used to say to the kids at the academy ''everyone leaves Liverpool at some stage in their life, just try and stay here as long as you can''. I hadn't anticipated applying it to myself.'

Frank McParland had been at Liverpool, on and off, for 20 years. He was the man who pushed to sign Raheem Sterling. He had been their chief scout under Rafa Benitez and director of their academy then, a year ago, chief executive Ian Ayre broke the news the club had decided to move in another direction. He was sacked.

Now director of football at Championship side Brentford, the pain has subsided sufficiently for him to reflect on the moment more philosophically.

'Football clubs don't stand still, there's always change and you can't always control it,' he reasons. 'I'm a Liverpool fan so it hurt, I loved every day I went to work there, made some great friends and we had a great family atmosphere around the place. I've got great affection for the club and I keep in touch with Brendan Rodgers, Ian Ayre, Raheem and Steven Gerrard. Although I left, they still treated me with the utmost respect and as they say, when one door closes another opens.'

McParland went on holiday to Tenerife for five days to contemplate his future. It rained for four of them.

'I was miserable, then out of the blue I got a call from Matthew Benham, the owner of Brentford, who said he wanted to meet for dinner with Uwe Rosler and the director of football Mark Warburton to discuss a few ideas. I'd had an offer from Norway and one from New York Cosmos but I was intrigued.'

By the time dinner came round though, Rosler had informed Brentford that he wanted to take the manager's job at Wigan and Benham did not stand in the German's way.

McParland works with manager Mark Warburton and coach David Weir 

McParland was asked to take Warburton's role as director of football and Warburton become manager. McParland agreed, even offering to walk away at the end of the season if it didn't work out.

Brentford were fourth when McParland joined and started with a 1-0 win at Oldham, secured in the 93rd minute.

The next stage was the appointment of coach David Weir, the ex-Everton and Rangers captain, who had had a brief spell managing Sheffield United.

'Davie's a great coach with good ideas and he shared our vision. He was very unfortunate at Sheffield United but he showed there the style he wanted to play and that was similar to what Mark and myself wanted.'

Weir and McParland moved in together, sharing an apartment in Ealing; 'we were like the Odd Couple,' says McParland. 'One staunch Everton, one staunch Liverpool. It was an interesting experience.'

McParland enjoys night matches at Griffin Park and is looking forward to Friday's derby with Fulham

Five months later they clinched promotion to the Championship for the first time in 21 years and, going into Friday's derby with west London rivals Fulham, sit sixth in the table.

Although managers such as Harry Redknapp contend they could not work with a director of football, McParland has faith in Brentford's system.

'The whole experience has been a breath of fresh air,' says McParland. 'We have a really open relationship. Matthew, the owner, believes that everyone should be able to say what they think to each other and we do.

'It can't work if, as is the case at some clubs, the manager doesn't agree on the players you sign or a committee decides. We all have to agree and if one of us doesn't then we don't do it.

McParland is the impressed with Brentford owner Matthew Benham and his vision for the club

'Mark is one of the hardest workers I've come across. He's always the first one in and last one out and he lives nearly a two hour drive away, you know what London traffic is like! Davie likes to try and beat him in of a morning but even when he's got there at 7am, 'Warbs' is in with a coffee on the go.

'Mark is a visionary. He gives the players such confidence, he doesn't blame them, he doesn't lambast them over mistakes. There's a structure to what he does and the football is attractive.'

That is only fitting as legend has it football began in Brentford when Julius Caesar kicked the skull of a vanquished Briton across the River Brent in 54 BC.

Brentford have had an excellent start to the season and are in the top six of the Championship

'A couple of old guys came up to me recently and said this was the best football they had seen here,' says McParland. 'I don't think they were around for Julius Caesar's debut but they'd been coming here for 60 years.'

However, Griffin Park, Brentford's home since 1904, will not be for much longer. Benham has a new stadium schemed for nearby Kew in 2017/18.

'Matthew made a bold decision,' says McParland. 'It would have been cheaper to move farther away but he found the site at Kew and it's important for the fans to keep that identity with the area. I'll be sorry to leave Griffin Park though because on a night game, like the one coming up on Friday, we'll have a cracking atmosphere and the place will be rocking.

'The plan is keep building and nurturing to give the fans something to shout about when we move too. We're all dreaming of going up, it might not be realistic just yet but, as I've found out, you just never know what's round the corner.'
