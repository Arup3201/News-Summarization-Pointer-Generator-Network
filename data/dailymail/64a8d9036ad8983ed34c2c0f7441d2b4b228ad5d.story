Patients with high blood pressure could be taking drugs needlessly because they suffer from ‘white coat’ nerves.

A scientific review says many people give artificially high readings because they are anxious when the doctor gives them a blood pressure check.

For the first time the research suggests that doctors, but not nurses, are the main cause of the phenomenon.

'White coat' phenomenon happens when a patient becomes anxious about having their blood pressure taken by a doctor, and so it pushes up their blood pressure and gives a false reading. Now it is revealed that many patients may have been given unnecessary drugs due to these false readings

Previous studies have suggested any health professional can trigger the nervousness that sends blood pressure shooting up.

But
 the first thorough analysis of scientific data has revealed that 
doctors routinely record levels significantly higher than those recorded
 by nurses.

The difference 
could be enough to result in a patient being put on blood pressure drugs
 for life when they don’t actually need them.

The
 threshold for diagnosing hypertension – the medical term for high blood
 pressure – is defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 or more (the 
top number), or a diastolic reading of 90 or more (the bottom number).

The new review shows these readings when taken by doctors are higher – by 7 and 4 respectively – than when taken by nurses.

Drugs
 are normally offered at higher readings than the threshold, but the 
‘white coat’ difference could result in a prescription, according to 
study leader Christopher Clark, of the University of Exeter Medical 
School.

Blood pressure is the flow of blood through the arteries and blood vessels, and high blood pressure can be an exacerbating factor a medley of different conditions, including heart disease and diabetes

‘Doctors should 
continue to measure blood pressure as part of the assessment of an ill 
patient or a routine check-up, but not where clinical decisions on blood
 pressure treatment depend on the outcome,’ he said.

‘The
 difference we noted is enough to tip some patients over the threshold 
for treatment for high blood pressure, and unnecessary medication can 
lead to unwanted side-effects.

‘Some patients may be erroneously asked to continue to monitor their own blood pressure at home, which can build anxiety.

‘These
 inappropriate measures could all be avoided by the simple measure of 
someone other than a doctor taking the blood pressure recording.’

The
 research team examined the blood pressure levels of 1,019 individuals 
whose measurements had been taken by both doctors and nurses at the same
 visit.

The review was published in the British Journal of General Practice.

Dr
 Clark added: ‘Our results were pooled from different settings across 
ten countries, so we can be confident that they can be generalised to 
any healthcare environment where blood pressure is being measured.

‘These results were all from research trials – our next task will be to examine data from GP surgeries.’

He
 said the findings raised issues about how studies are carried out that 
compare treatment by doctors and nurses: ‘Some studies have concluded 
that nurses are better at treating hypertension, when in fact those 
findings could be down to this recording bias.’

In
 the UK 12million people have high blood pressure, 5.7million of whom 
are undiagnosed. It is estimated it costs the NHS £1billion per year in 
drugs alone.

Maureen Talbot,
 senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘If we feel
 anxious during blood pressure measurement this can bump up our results.

‘Measuring
 blood pressure regularly over 24 hours gives a far more accurate 
reading and reduces the risk of unnecessary treatment.’

A cross section of a blood vessel exhibiting hypertension, or high blood pressure. The vessel is constricted, and this means that it is likely to cause the heart to have to pump harder to get the blood through, causing higher pressure in the blood vessels

Put in scientific terms, blood pressure a measurement of the arterial pressure of blood circulation.

Smaller and more constricted arteries and veins mean that blood has to flow through a smaller area when it is being pumped around the body, which makes the heart pump a lot faster. This is known as high blood pressure, or hypertension, and is like water flowing through a shallow river.

Low blood pressure is caused by more expansive, looser blood vessels, meaning that the same amount of blood has to flow through a much larger area, causing it to flow a lot slower. This is called low blood pressure or hypotension.

Blood pressure is measured by taking a reading from a person's upper arm, measuring the pressure of the brachial artery, a major artery in the arm.

The measurement is usually shown in terms of systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (show as mm Hg).

A healthy person's blood pressure will measure at around 98/69 mm Hg.

A person with high blood pressure will measure at 169/105 mm Hg, and a person with low blood pressure will measure at around 85/50 mm Hg.

Blood pressure affects the whole body, and is a risk factor in health problems like heart disease.

High blood pressure can be caused by a fatty diet as cholesterol will block up ordinarily normal sized blood vessels, which means the heart has to pump harder, leading to a higher pressure in key arteries.

The phenomenon is caused when people are nervous, driving up pressure
