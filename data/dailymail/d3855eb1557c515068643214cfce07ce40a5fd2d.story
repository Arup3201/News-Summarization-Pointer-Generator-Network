Mr. Huang and his four brothers are from the last fishermen that still keep the tradition of fishing using specially trained cormorants. In recent days, this ancient technique has transformed into a tourist attraction and a source of income for Mr. Huang, who desperately needs funds for buying medicines for his sick wife.

Photo and caption by Joyce Le Mesurier. At the annual Ananda Harvest Festival in Bagan, Myanmar, thousands of monks from all over Myanmar came to receive alms. While walking around the vast temple grounds, I chanced upon this boy monk who was playing with his toy gun. Even though it was only a toy gun, I found this image a disturbing juxtaposition of the peace that Buddhism embodies and the violence that guns symbolize. Location: Bagan, Myanmar

The children in the remote villa of Kong Lo in Laos were simply beautiful in the innocence of their smiles and curiousity for these strangers among them, that after playing about in a pile of hay, they were even more comfortable in front of the camera and their true spirit in what I experienced in the simplicity that they enjoyed around them and shared with me came through. The symbolism in there chosen pose here speak volumes to me. Location: Kong Lo, Laos
