Brazilian great Pele has backed FIFA's 
stance on its decision to ban Luis Suarez from all football-related 
activity for four months.

Suarez's World Cup ended in disgrace 
when the Uruguay striker was retrospectively punished for biting Italy 
defender Giorgio Chiellini on June 24.

The ruling, which also saw Suarez banned
 from nine international matches and fined Â£65,000, was greeted with 
dismay in Uruguay, with players and officials alike hitting out at FIFA 
for the severity of the punishment.

Opinion: Brazil legend Pele backs FIFA on its stance to ban Luis Suarez for four months from football

Speaking out: Pele says it 'sets an example' for Suarez's bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup

But with an appeal in the pipeline, Pele believes the governing body was well within its rights to make an example of Suarez.

Speaking at an event to promote G-Form 
shin guards, Pele said: 'If he was not sanctioned in this way, such 
incidents could be repeated.

'No player can do what Luis Suarez did. I 
believe that the punishment is fair.

'FIFA's decision is good and is correct because it sets an example.'

Pele does not believe the suspension will be too much of a setback in Suarez's career, however.

'He's a great player and he will bounce back,' Pele added.

Uruguay, along with Costa Rica, advanced
 from Group D at the expense of Italy and England, whose experience in 
Brazil was entirely forgettable as they collected just one point from 
three games.

However, Pele thinks they can learn from the setback and and has insisted Roy Hodgson must remain at the helm.

GROUP D TABLE

1. COSTA RICA (W2, D1, L0, 7 points)

2. URUGUAY (W2, D0, L1, 6 points)

3. ITALY (W1, D0, L2, 3 points)

4. ENGLAND (W0, D1, L2, 1 point)

ENGLAND RESULTS

DREW: England 0 - 0 Costa Rica

LOST: England 1 - 2 Italy

LOST: England 1 - 2 Uruguay

'I did not expect England to be 
eliminated early in the tournament; but as I always say: football is a 
box of surprises. In that same group, Costa Rica are proving to be a 
great surprise in this tournament,' he said.

'Roy Hodgson is not the main reason of 
the disappointing tournament for England. You need all the players and 
the entire organisation to be at their best during the tournament to 
perform well.

'An early elimination is always a good 
reason to review what went wrong and come back stronger. England can 
learn from today's mistakes and bounce back at Euro 2016.'

The 73-year-old, a three-time World Cup 
winner and Brazil's leading goal-scorer of all-time with 77 strikes in 
92 appearances, is enjoying the ongoing tournament on his home soil and 
is understandably desperate for his country to be crowned champions.

Dejected: England were knocked out of the World Cup in dismal fashion in a tough Group D

5 - James Rodriguez (Colombia)

4 - Thomas Muller (Germany), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Neymar (Brazil)

3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Robin van Persie (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)

Those in italic are out of the World Cup.

'I've loved the competition so far,' he said.

'The atmosphere here is fantastic. 
International fans are happy to be at the stadiums all over Brazil and 
the tournament has offered great football so far.

'My wish is that Brazil wins. It would be very sad for us if we don't win the competition.'

And Pele singled out Neymar for special praise.

The Barcelona forward has been Brazil's 
talisman in their group games, scoring four goals, and he fired home the
 deciding spot-kick to ensure the host nation edged Chile on penalties 
over the weekend.

'I have been very happy for Neymar so far in this tournament,' Pele said. 'He helped the team win some games by scoring goals.

'During the penalty kicks against Chile, he showed a lot of confidence and experience for his first-ever World Cup.'
