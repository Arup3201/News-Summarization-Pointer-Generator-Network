Help: Ofsted Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said private schools should be supporting those in the state sector

Independent schools are offering nothing more than the ‘crumbs from their tables’ to state schools they should be supporting, the head of Ofsted said yesterday.

Sir Michael Wilshaw said private schools should be supporting those in the state sector.

But many give the impression they only do their duty ‘when push comes to shove’, he said.

Many offer little more than coaching for A-level students or the use of playing fields, he claimed - providing ‘ammunition’ for critics who think strict quotas should be introduced to give more university places to state school pupils.

The chief inspector of schools quoted Independent Schools Council figures that only three per cent of members - 34 schools - were sponsoring or co-sponsoring an academy school and five per cent were loaning teaching staff.

In his speech to leading independent headteachers at a conference in London, he reminded them many of their schools had been founded with a mission to help underprivileged children.

Describing it as his ‘Kitchener moment’, he said: ‘Your country needs you.’

He added: ‘The ISC’s list of activities is hardly evidence of a comprehensive commitment to partnership with state schools.

‘It’s thin stuff. These are crumbs off your tables, leading more to famine than feast.’

Sir Michael said if the private sector treated the state as a ‘rival’ they should ‘not be surprised if it returns the sentiment’.

‘It would be a moral retreat and a tactical mistake to confuse independence with isolation - haughty detachment can become a very tempting target,’ he added.

Schools that ‘choose to remain aloof... only give ammunition to those who would like to put even stricter quotas on independent pupils’ access to our top, publicly-funded universities’.

Universities charging fees above £6,000 now have to prepare ‘access agreements’ to show how they are widening access to include more teenagers from deprived backgrounds.

Maintained schools have shown significant improvements in recent years, Sir Michael said.

Against: Martin Reader, headmaster of Wellington School in Somerset (pictured) complained primaries and secondaries in his area ¿politically object¿ to private schools and had refused assistance

But he highlighted two main areas of concern - ‘huge’ regional variations in schools’ quality and underachievement among the poorest children’.

He added: ‘Heads in inner city London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds haven’t got the time to worry whether their children are climbing trees proficiently.

‘These heads know that gaining academic qualifications is the one route out of poverty and disadvantage.’ The comments received a mixed reception at the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference annual meeting, with some in the audience angrily rejecting the accusation they were doing too little.

Wellington School headmaster Martin Reader complained primaries and secondaries in his area ‘politically object’ to private schools and had refused assistance.

Another delegate complained to Sir Michael that schools which offer help other than sponsoring academies ‘fail your test’.

ISC general secretary Matthew Burgess said Sir Michael’s comments showed a ‘lack of understanding’ at the work independent schools do in the state sector.

‘Rather than focus on one prescriptive form of support clearly favoured by HM Chief Inspector, our schools use their independence to deliver tailored programmes in local partnerships,’ he added.

‘Our most recent census disclosed that over 90 per cent of our schools are already involved in genuine and meaningful collaborative work with their state sector colleagues.’

Sir Michael praised some schools including Eton, which has co-sponsored the London Academy of Excellence, a sixth form college in Newham, and Winchester, which has established a partnership with Midhurst Rother College in West Sussex.
