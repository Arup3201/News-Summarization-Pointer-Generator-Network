An artist has married the man of her dreams four years after painting his lookalike in a prophetic piece of artwork.

In 2009, Chloe Mayo, who was single at the time, quickly dashed off an oil painting of her holding hands with a handsome, dark bearded man.

Not thinking anything more of the creation, the 31-year-old left the painting to gather dust in the corner of her living room.

Artist Chloe Mayo painted a picture of her perfect husband... only to later meet an identical real-life version

Because the oil painting was so uncannily similar to Michael, she hid the canvas under her bed in fear he thought she may have been stalking him, but he fell in love with it

In her search for love, Chloe joined an online dating website, and began messaging Michael Goeman, 30.

Two months later the pair met - and Chloe was shocked to find Michael was the spitting image of the man in her painting.

In fear of putting off her new lover, Chloe hid the uncanny painting under her bed, only revealing it once she had been on more dates with Michael.

Thankfully, he was not put off by the painting and they continued their relationship for a further 18 months until he proposed while they were holidaying in the south of France.

Three years after they first met, Chloe and Michael married, and the painting now has pride of place in the living room of the couple's home in Worcester Park near Croydon in Surrey.

Chloe, a regulation manager for medical equipment, said: 'I had moved back to the UK after spending time working in Australia and the house needed brightening up.

After dating for six weeks Chloe thought Michael's face looked familiar and then remembered her painting and realised he was the spitting image of the man she painted

'I started painting some pictures to decorate the walls and I had a couple of ideas I wanted to incorporate.

'I wanted to create an image of a couple at nighttime but I didn't really have any set ideas, I just did what felt natural.

'I painted kisses coming off the trees so it looked romantic but the facial features on the people I actually added in last, I didn't intend for it to look like me with anyone.

'I didn't hang it up, I just left it in a pile in the corner of my lounge for weeks and forgot about it but after a night out with Michael I realised he looked just like the man.

'He was due to come over to my house and I thought that if he saw the picture he would think I was a stalker and a bit weird, so I hid it under my bed.

'About a week later I mustered up the courage to show him and although he looked a bit confused, he saw the funny side when I explained what had happened.

The happy couple, who met online, now hang the painting on their wall and dub him 'the man in the painting'

'Now we have hung the picture up on the wall in the lounge and all our friends called Michael "The man in the painting".

'I never would have thought I'd have predicted my husband and I don't normally believe in that sort of thing, but I suppose it must be fate.'Â
