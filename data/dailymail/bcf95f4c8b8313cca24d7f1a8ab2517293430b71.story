Jack Wilshere doesn't believe Mesut Ozil's injury will change Arsenal's fortunes.

The £42.5million German has been ruled out until early next year after tearing his knee ligaments.

But Wilshere believes the loss will not hamper Arsenal's system and pointed to the return of Theo Walcott as cause for celebration.

Jack Wilshere says Arsenal might not miss Mesut Ozil as he has been playing out wide and not in the middle

'Ozil was playing on the left a bit so it probably won't change much in the centre,' he said.

'Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will get a chance. Walcott is coming back as well. Now it might give Theo or Chambo a chance.

'We are devastated for Mesut because he can play in that number 10 (role), we have seen what he can do at number 10. We have players who can come in.'

Despite backing Arsene Wenger's side to strive on, Wilshere - no stranger to the treatment room himself - expressed his sympathy for Ozil.

'It's tough to take but it is part and parcel of football. I have had my fair few injuries,' he said.

'It is not a curse, it happens and you just have to deal with it.

'It will be hard for him [Ozil] because he likes football, he has never really had an injury before. He had a slight one last season.

'I am not even sure how long it is, I've not been back to the club. It will be difficult for him. But he is naturally quite a fit lad so he will be alright.'
