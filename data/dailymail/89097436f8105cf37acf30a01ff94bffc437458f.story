The Georgia parents of a two-year-old girl killed along with 12 other children and six adults at a Qatar shopping mall fear the truth behind the blaze will never be known.

Authorities in the richest country in the world have reneged on their promise to share findings from a government report into the fire at the Villaggio shopping mall in Doha in May last year.

They also failed to include the report as evidence in the trial of seven people including the nursery owners, four mall managers and an inspector from Qatar's Ministry of Business and Trade, who were charged with negligence and failing to adhere to safety regulations.

Tragedy: Zaier Aouani and Grace O with their daughter, Zeinah Aouani, at the Villaggio mall in Doha, Qatar, where the two-and-a-half-year-old was killed

A verdict in what has been described as a show trial is expected on Thursday, but 
Zaier Aouani, who was teaching at Qatar University at the 
time of the fire, is pessimistic that there will be justice for his daughter Zeinah's death.

'I’m not confident,' Mr Aouani told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'The entire system has failed us.'

His wife, Grace O, who watched 
helplessly as fire swept through the mall, trapping her daughter and 
other children in the nursery, added: 'Everyone says it’s a trial for show.'

Parents of other children who were 
trapped in the Gympanzee nursery and died in the fire, have also 
complained about a lack of information from Qataris.

'It’s been a deafening silence,' 
Martin Weekes, whose triplets were killed in the fire, said. 'We don’t 
know what happened. We don’t know if any improvements have been made.'

An investigation into the fire at the mall found a 'lack of adherence to required laws, systems, and measure 
by all concerned parties to different degree[s]. This includes adherence
to design, license, and safety conditions, which contributed to [the] Villaggio catastrophe.'

It is believed the fire was started 
by a short circuit in a fluorescent light in the storeroom of a Nike 
shop. A civil defense officer told Al Jazeera that the toxic paint used 
to paint the mall, which is made to look like Venice complete with a sky
mural throughout, caused the fire and smoke to spread.

Zeinah and the other children left at
the nursery, which was up a single flight of stairs, were trapped and 
killed by the noxious smoke.

The hearing to determine criminal 
responsibility for the fire had previously been postponed four times 
before all seven defendants showed up to court.

However, the local media in have been
prevented from publishing details from the trial until the verdict, 
according to the Doha Centre for Media Freedom.

A Civil Defence officer told the 
hearing that Villaggio has been repeatedly fined for using a highly 
flammable paint in its mall decorations, which, when ignited, causes 
fire to spread quickly and is difficult to contain, according to TVNZ.

It was also noted that sprinklers 
that could have stopped the smoke did not appear to be functioning and 
Villaggio officials had not responded to requests to perform maintenance
on the equipment.

Zeinah's parents believe the little girl's death could have been prevented.

Witnesses said when the fire alarm went off in the mall, security guards assured shoppers it was a false alarm.

Firefighters were also slow to respond, arriving almost an hour after witnesses first spotted smoke above the mall.

Firefighter Abdel 
Khaleq al Huwari, who was one of the first 
to go into the blazing building, said the emergency services were not 
told there was a nursery in the mall until half an hour after they 
arrived.

Martin and Jane Weekes, whose two-year-old triplets Lillie, Jackson and Willsher died in the Gympanzee nursery, said: 'We want an understanding of what actually went wrong and how to ensure it never happens again.

'We
all want answers and accountability ... It won't bring back our loved 
ones, but it will help to ensure this can never happen again.'

Ms O, from Atlanta, had been visiting
her husband in Qatar while he was working at a university at the time 
of the fire. After hearing about the fire she rushed to the mall but 
said she was forced to watch helplessly while her daughter was trapped 
inside.

'I could see really thick black smoke 
was coming out of the mall,' she said. But 
authorities would not allow her into the building, telling her: 'Your 
kid is safe inside.'

'I even told one firefighter, "I can give you money",' she said. 'Please
go check the nursery. They just looked at me like a crazy person who 
doesn’t know what’s going on.'

The couple have hired lawyers and 
turned to senator Johnny Isakson's office for help, but have not yet 
received the answers they are looking for.

'We’re not going to stop until we get that report,' Ms O said.

The
couple had no idea if their daughter was among the children until a 
reporter led them to a hospital where most of the bodies had been taken 
to.

There, the couple were shown photographs of all the dead children.

'At the hospital, when we 
went to the mortuary, they showed us pictures of dead kids. All the kids
from the nursery were dead. They just asked me, "Is this your kid, Is 
this your kid?" My kid was the last one.'

Zeinah's body had no burn marks, which her family say is a sign her death could have been prevented.

Misled: Smoke began billowing from the roof of the mall, but witnesses claim security guards told shoppers it was simply a false alarm

Tragedy: The fire quickly took hold, yet some shoppers have claimed that fire alarms failed to go off, or were barely audible

'Fire
can happen. This death of kids and teachers could have been prevented. 
The death of everyone could have been prevented,' Ms O said.

'There is such incompetence that it makes me angry right now. But I'm so sad. So sad.'

Critics said that the government of the oil-rich nation, run by the 
Al Thani ruling family, is trying to cover up the findings as it 
prepares to host the World Cup in 2022.

The fire also came as the country was 
forced to counter criticism about its poor human rights record. More 
than 85 per cent of the population in the tiny country is made up of 
foreign nationals.

While all foreign workers are 
subjected to forced blood tests, X-rays and finger printing, and cannot 
leave the country without a signed permit from their employer, the 
workers used to keep up with the rapid construction of apartment blocks,
offices and malls are also forced to work long hours in intense heat and on sites with poor safety records, according to 
Human Rights Watch.

'Qatar has been quite successful at 
giving off a progressive image when, in fact, the [labor] system is 
exploitative,' Nicholas McGeehan, of Human Rights Watch, told CNN.

'It is the same old story. The Kafala
system, the confiscation of passports, the illegal charging of 
exorbitant agent fees, the inability for workers to access the courts 
for redress.'
