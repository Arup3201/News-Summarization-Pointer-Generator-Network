A grieving daughter who wanted her father’s funeral to be ‘a perfect send-off’ has claimed it was ruined by a council official halting the burial, telling her that metal coffins were banned.

Stella Birdsall, 48, had ordered a £3,000, vacuum-sealed, navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father Colin, 72, because she wanted ‘to do the very best by my dad’.

She said the service at St Botolph’s Church, in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, on Thursday ‘went beautifully’ but then the official ‘ambushed’ the funeral cortege beside the open grave.

Stella Birdstall, 48, was holding a funeral service for her father Colin, 72, in this church in West Yorkshire when a council official halted proceedings because they were using a metal casket - which is banned  

Miss Birdsall said he told the family that the interment could not go ahead because it breached Wakefield Council’s policy barring the use of metal caskets – and that she had two options, either to postpone the burial or to change the casket. 

‘Everybody was in a state of shock,’ she said. ‘I was dumbfounded.’

After a hurried discussion, the family decided that the hearse should return to the undertaker’s parlour so that the body could be transferred into a wooden coffin.

She said her father’s body was put in a plain, plywood box which was the only one they had in stock.

Miss Birdsall said she did not blame the undertaker, Jennings Funeral Services, but added: ‘It was like Wakefield Council ambushed my father’s burial.’

Miss Birdsall said she is looking at exhuming her father’s body for reburial in a more suitable coffin. She added: ‘Nobody has been talking about what a beautiful service it was. It has all been about what happened at the graveside.’

A spokesman for Wakefield Council said: ‘We are looking into these comments and until we have done this we are not in a position to comment.’
