At times, David Cameron must feel as though the weight of the world is on his shoulders.

And his three-year-old daughter only added to the load yesterday – when she hitched a ride on his back as he took her to nursery.

But she was clearly one burden Mr Cameron did not find the least bit onerous. He smiled as he strode down the pavement with Florence perched on top of him, after she chose to travel by Prime Minister rather than use her purple scooter.

Mr Cameron looked more like the entrant of a gurning competition as his daughter playfully pulled at his face

David Cameron was all smiles as he carried daughter Florence on his shoulders through the streets of Westminster

The Prime Minister likes to boast of having a vision for the country but could not see at all during his walk to nursery

Leaving Downing Street Mr Cameron carried a scooter in one hand while Florence enjoyed a bird's eye view

Wearing a multi-coloured polka dot 
safety helmet and with her father holding her steady by the ankles, 
Florence could not resist cheekily covering Mr Cameron’s eyes, before 
grabbing his face with both hands and making it clear who was boss.

But the Prime Minister still looked every inch the relaxed dad, holding on to his daughter’s scooter with his free hand.

Unusually
 for a man who has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving 
to Number 10, Mr Cameron, 47, did not seem bothered who saw his display 
of closeness with his youngest, and this set of pictures has been 
approved by Downing Street for publication.

After dropping Florence off, it was business as usual for the Prime Minister as he dashed back for a Cabinet meeting.

Issues on the agenda 
included Ukraine and public sector pay, where Chief Secretary to the 
Treasury Danny Alexander updated ministers on changes being made to 
Whitehall salaries.

Mr Cameron has spoken candidly about the challenge of juggling the school run with running the country.

He
 said: ‘Maybe once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, tragically 
sometimes once a month I manage to take my children to school, but it’s 
got to be possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good 
prime minister at the same time.’

When the shoulders became too much Mr Cameron switched to carrying his three-year-old daughter while holding a scooter and a bag in his right hand

An aide to the Prime Minister was also roped in to hold a bag while Mr Cameron had Florence on his shoulders

Every parent will have sympathy for the battle to get toddlers to get a move on in the morning, so it was no surprise that in the end Mr Cameron picked Florence up and carried her on his shoulders.

With her hands in danger of covering dad's eyes, Mr Cameron was also seen carrying a buggy and shopping bag as they made their way through Westminster.

Asked about being seen on the school run, the PM once responded by saying: 'Maybe once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, tragically sometimes once a month I manage to take my children to school, but it's got to be possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good prime minister at the same time.'
