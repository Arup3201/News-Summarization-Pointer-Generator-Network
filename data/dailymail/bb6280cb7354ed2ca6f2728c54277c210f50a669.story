A gambling fan decided to celebrate the anniversary of his second divorce by sponsoring a horse race - and he even backed the winner.

David Chillery, 69, paid £300 to back a race at Newton Abbot Racecourse - cheekily named the David Chillery Still Celebrating His Divorce Selling Handicap Hurdle.

He marks the anniversary of his 1996
 divorce from second wife Madeline every year, with the last couple 
being celebrated with a day out at the Devon racecourse.

Special race: Mr Chillery paid £300 to sponsor a race in celebration of his divorce. He was given more reason to celebrate when the horse he backed, Cash For Steel, romped in first, ridden by Daniel Hiskett

The race was run over two miles and six furlongs. Mr Chillery watched the action from a box where he sipped champagne with friends and family - including daughter Victoria from his second marriage.

'When the race was announced you could hear the commentator was tickled because of the tone of his voice, it sounded as if he was trying hard to keep a straight face. I absolutely love it,' Mr Chillery told the Express.

Mr Chillery, of Dawlish Devon, was given more reason to celebrate when the horse he backed, Cash For Steel, romped in first, ridden by Daniel Hiskett.

The win brought him in £1200 - money that went towards the sponsorship, he said.

Mr Chillery met and married his first wife Jean in 1966 in Andover, Hampshire. They had four children together, but the marriage only lasted six years - ending when Jean had an affair.

He met Madeline, his second wife, while living in Woking, Surrey. Her husband was the boss of the taxi company where he worked. They wed in 1977 and had a daughter Victoria, now 36.

The marriage ended when Madeline met someone else, and the couple were divorced on June 24 1996. They now don't speak, despite living close to each other.

'I was so pleased to be free I decided to
 mark the day every year, so on June 24 I host a "gentleman’s afternoon"
 with some of the lads,' said Mr Chillery.

Since then, Mr Chillery has remained happily single and has been able to spend more time on his passions, which include football and amateur dramatics - as well as horse racing.

Mr Chillery added: 'I plan to retire in about five years and if I was still married I would never have been able to afford to carry on like this.'
