Moggy paddle: It launches itself into the water, seemingly unafraid of the water

Far from being afraid of the water, the cat voluntarily walks into it.

The footage shows the black and white moggie taking tentative steps from the shore into the water.

Encouraged by its owner, it starts to paddle, its tail trailing behind it on the water's surface.

It is then joined by the woman, who swims alongside her pet cat as the pair make their way toward some rocks.

The moggie shows no signs of distress throughout the short clip and seems relaxed after its dip.

Little is known about the cat, except that the footage was filmed in Russia.
