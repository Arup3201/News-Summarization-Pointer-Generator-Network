Michael Schumacher's manager said there is still no clear time-frame for the Formula One star's recovery following a freak ski accident almost a year ago. 

Sabine Kehm yesterday said it was 'not possible' to say how long it would take for Scumacher to fully recover. She said he faced a 'difficult' and 'long' rehabilitation. 

Schumacher suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family in the French Alps on December 29. The accident left him with brain damage and he was in a coma for six months.

He has been recovering at his home in Gland, Switzerland, since June. 

The Local reports Ms Kehm as saying: 'Michael is making progress appropriate to the severity of his situation, but it will be a difficult and long process.' 

Ms Kehm said Schumacher's family are grateful for the constant flood of well wishes from fans of the seven-time world champion.

She said: 'I can only say again that the family is very happy and touched by the sympathetic messages.

'I believe that positive energy does them good. We appreciate the condolences from around the world.'

Last month, a French doctor treating Schumacher said that the 45-year-old was making progress, but will need years to fully recover.

Schumacher is said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair. He cannot speak and has memory problems, according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff who has visited him.

The Frenchman said: 'He is getting better but everything is relative.'

Streiff, 59, was seen visiting Schumacher when the German was in intensive care in Grenoble Hospital, France.

Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened. 

He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers.

But shortly after 11am he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates.

It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock.

He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged.

The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident.

Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out.

He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run.

Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries.

He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain.

At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma.

On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'.

He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment.

It was the first piece of positive news for months.

Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. 

Schumacher's wife Corinna was a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.
