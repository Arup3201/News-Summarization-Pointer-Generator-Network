The Only Way is Essex star James Argent has apologised for sparking a  police missing person alert when he reportedly went to the 'wrong airport' and vanished for 24 hours.

Fears grew for Arg after he failed to turn up for an early-morning flight to Majorca after leaving his family home at 3.30am yesterday in Woodford Green, east London.

Scotland Yard issued a public appeal for his whereabouts this morning, 26 hours after he vanished, as fans began a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #PrayForArg.

But just three hours later he phoned his father, who told MailOnline he may have turned up at Stansted Airport in Essex while his worried agent waited at Gatwick.

Sorry: The 26-year-old  posted this Twitter update saying he was 'fine and safe' and didn't mean to cause a fuss

Urgent appeal: Scotland Yard released this photo of The Only Way is Essex star James Argent after he was reported missing - but he made contact hours later. His father believes he may have gone to the wrong airport

Missing: James 'Arg' Argent was seen at 3.30am yesterday at his family home in Woodford Green, east London

His father Martin Argent, 58, said today: 'He left the house at 3.30am and was due to meet his agent at the airport just after 5am.

'I think the agent was at Gatwick but he told us he was going to Stansted, so we thought he might have gone to the wrong airport.

'His agent kept ringing and saying "where was he" and we couldn't make contact with him all day long.

'He's now on his way to his next engagement which is in Blackpool. He was only due to be in Majorca for one afternoon.

'We had to report it because his agent was panicking, we were panicking, because we couldn't account for his whereabouts. We tried all his friends and none of them knew where he was. 

No flight risk: It is thought the star was supposed to meet his agent yesterday at London Gatwick Airport...

The only way is Essex: ...But instead may have turned up at Stansted, a smaller airport in his favourite county

Worry: Fans began a #PrayForArg hashtag and Towie co-star Sam Faiers joined in with those hunting for him

'He's just phoned to say he had trouble with his phone and he's sorry to have caused everyone all this worry. 

'We don't know all the detail yet but we're really relieved that we've heard from him and we know that he's okay.' 

Popular: At one point Arg was the most talked-about topic in the capital. He is now heading to Blackpool

The reality star - nicknamed Arg - was last seen at 3am yesterday as he left for an airport from his home in Woodford Green, east London. 

Essex Police said they were growing increasingly concerned for the welfare of the 26-year-old, who is often seen in Brentwood and nightclubs in Redbridge but had not made any contact with friends or family since his disappearance. 

The star is in the process of moving out of his parents' house in Woodford Green to a two-bedroom flat in Chigwell, just three miles away.

He was pictured in an emotional hug with his mother Patricia, 53, as he began moving items from where he has lived with her, his 58-year-old father Martin and 24-year-old sister Natasha for more than 20 years.

'I'm moving out into the heart of Chigwell,' he told Reveal magazine. 'It's a two bedroom flat and it's actually in the same block of flats as [co-star Elliott Wright]. I'm really excited; I feel like I've finally made it.' 

A spokesman for the reality star said before he vanished: 'James Argent left home at 3am on Friday morning to meet his agent at the airport to catch a flight for work abroad.

'When he failed to turn up, he was reported missing by his family who are understandably concerned.'

Emotional: Arg gave his mother a hug as he prepared to fly the nest. His father Martin told MailOnline he had no choice but to inform the police as he and Arg's agent had tried everything they could to get hold of him

3.30am, Friday August 29

He leaves his parents' house in Woodford Green, east London, to catch a flight for a one-day round trip to work in Majorca.

5.30am

His agent fears for his welfare after he fails to show at the airport, thought to be Gatwick.

Evening

Unable to reach him all day, his parents Martin and Patricia sound the alarm. 

5.53am, Saturday August 30

Scotland Yard issues a formal missing person appeal with a photo of Arg.

9am

His father Martin reveals he is safe and well and on his way to Blackpool.

11am

The appeal is removed from the Met's website.

Last month Arg and co-star Dan Osborne pulled out of appearances at nightspots in Magaluf after the resort was hit by scandal around a now-infamous sex video.

A girl performed sex acts on more than 20 men in two minutes as part of a barcrawl run by Carnage Magaluf, whose website had previously claimed Osborne would be appearing for two weeks this month.

Arg's last public appearance was believed to have been on Thursday, August 21, when he took part in the Ice Bucket Challenge wearing a full black suit in London's Leicester Square.

He pledged his donation to the Greenfingers charity, which creates gardens for children's hospices, and tweeted: 'I nominate the following for the Ice Bucket Challenge @LydiaRoseBright @debbietowie & @JamesBennewith .U have 24hrs! http://www.justgiving.com/nowgreenfingers.' 

Arg shot to fame when he joined the Towie cast along with his best friend Mark Wright when the series first aired in 2010.

He collected the show's Bafta Audience Award in 2011, amassing 1.4million Twitter followers  and appearing on a host of chat shows.

In 2012 he ran the London Marathon in just over six hours in aid of Cancer Research. 

And he is expected to appear in the next season of Towie, due to be aired on new channel ITVBe in October. 

Good cause: The reality star took part in the Ice Bucket Challenge in London's Leicester Square

Soaking: A crowd gathered as he completed the stunt in aid of the Greenfingers charity

Meme: Within minutes, images had begun linking Arg to  serious world events (albeit in fairly poor taste)

The reality star, who is best friends with co-star Mark Wright, appeared in series one with his ex-girlfriend Lydia Bright, with whom his romance recently reignited.

The couple split two years ago after 26-year-old Arg was accused of cheating on her, and he spent the last series of the show trying to woo her back.

Earlier this month Lydia admitted she still had feelings for her former lover.

He also  bought Lydia a micro pig called Mr Darcy for Christmas in 2011 and took her on a date to visit him in July this year.

The 26-year-old dated co-star Gemma Collins in June 2012 but they soon split.

Argent began acting and singing in 2002 after winning the coveted Kenny Award at Kenneth More Theatre in Ilford, East London. He also works as a Frank Sinatra-inspired singer.

In late 2013 he took part in the first series of the Channel 5 reality series Celebrity Super Spa, along with Helen Flanagan, Rustie Lee, John Burton-Race, Jody Latham and Yvette Fielding. 

Popular: Arg has 1.4million Twitter followers and his last Tweet on Thursday appealed to co-star Lydia Bright

Ex: Arg previously dated Towie co-star Lydia Bright and they were pictured in recent embrace on the show

Drama: Argent has been a favourite on the Essex-based reality show since its inception in 2010

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said before he was found: 'His family and friends knew him to be at his home address at the time.

'Obviously he has left home but it is not known where to. It is unusual according to his family and his agent.'

Police had described him as white and 'of large build', about 6ft tall with dark hair.

At the time of his disappearance he was wearing a blue tracksuit, believed to be a Nike, and was carrying a blue sports bag. 

Unusual: Most police appeals involve children, the elderly or the mentally ill. James Argent is 26

Yesterday it emerged the Metropolitan Police has classed four rape cases as 'no crime' - so why did it pour such resources by comparison into finding the reality star?

Police have to follow a strict set of guidelines laid down by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) before they issue a public appeal and a photo.

Forces receive a huge number of calls - the vast majority of which later turn out to be false alarms.

That means some cases have to be 'bumped up' the priority list, especially if they include a fear for someone's welfare, as was the case with the press release regarding James Argent.

But officers have been criticised for using the category too readily because fewer checks are needed before making an appeal.

The Acpo guidelines say: 'There have been several cases where the Police Service has been criticised for misuse of this category when the correct one should have been missing person.

'It is poor practice to use such a category to avoid the rigours of a full missing person investigation.'

Most of the missing person appeals made by the Metropolitan Police recently involved people who were obviously vulnerable in some way.

Of the 15 appeals the force has made in the last ten days, just three involved apparently healthy adults.

Eight involved children or teenagers and four involved the elderly, or people with autism or dementia. 

However, police are also duty-bound under the Human Rights Act to 'take reasonable action, within their powers, to safeguard the rights of individuals who may be at risk.'

The guidelines add: 'Failure to properly investigate a report of a missing person may leave an individual at risk and the Police Service vulnerable to a legal challenge under either the Human Rights Act or the law relating to negligence.

Officers are advised to imagine the worst in every situation. The motto is: 'If in doubt, think murder'.
