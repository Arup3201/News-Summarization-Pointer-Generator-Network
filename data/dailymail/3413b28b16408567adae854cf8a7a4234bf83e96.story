It was one of the most written about moments of the England rugby team's ill-fated 2011 World Cup campaign but  Mike Tindall says he has 'no regrets' about the infamous dwarf-tossing incident.

'Do I have any regrets about the evening?' he said. 'No because I had a good time with a lot of the players that I enjoyed playing with, with a lot of fans who I enjoy spending time with.

'It was nothing we didn't do in 2003,'  continued Tindall, adding: 'Not one player threw a dwarf.'

Dangerous job: Tindall is currently filming for winter sports themed reality show The Jump in Austria

The incident, which took place at a Queenstown nightclub, came days after England had battled to victory against Argentina in a pool game.

Keen to let their hair down, the players decamped to the club which was hosting a 'Mad Midget Weekender' that included a dwarf-throwing contest.

Worse still, Tindall, then captain, was also pictured with his arm around a 'mystery blonde' who later turned out to be an old friend - although not before a tranche of negative headlines appeared in papers around the world.

When England limped out of the competition following a quarter final defeat against France and more off-pitch antics, the team, and Tindall, who was slapped with a £25,000 fine for 'serious misconduct', were vilified.

Since then, much has changed for 36-year-old Tindall who became a father to baby daughter Mia a year ago and who is currently in training for an appearance on Channel 4 reality show, The Jump.

Consequences: England later crashed out of the 2011 World Cup and Tindall was fined £25,000

Moving on: Since then Tindall, who is married to Zara Phillips, has become a father to daughter Mia

Tindall, who is taking a break from filming in Austria to fly home for his daughter's first birthday on Saturday, is clearly enjoying being a parent to his 'very chilled' baby.

According to the rugby player, Mia, who does not have a nanny, spends much of her time travelling with her mother Zara Phillips, the  33-year-old Olympic silver medallist and the Queen's granddaughter.

'She stays in the truck [horsebox] with her,' said Tindall, who was speaking to the Times newspaper.

'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. You are going to travel around a lot.' 

Despite both parents' sporting success, Tindall says he doesn't expect his daughter to go on to a rugby or eventing career of her own but says the couple already have three Shetland ponies waiting for her.

Royal: Tindall is now a fully-fledged member of the royal family and regularly attends events

Future: Tindall says he wants Mia to make her own decision about following in her parents sporty footsteps

'Ideally, I don't think we would have her on a horse or a rugby pitch but she might make her own decision and then you have just got to support it.

'I don't think we'll ever keep her away from horses. We've got three Shetland ponies waiting for her. 

'If it's death-defying feats she wants to do, you have to get your head round it and support her, and if she wants to study and be a nuclear physicist, you do that as well.'

But with a mother aiming for gold at Rio 2015 and a father who is about to risk life and limb attempting ski jumps on a reality TV show, the former probably awaits for little Mia Tindall.
