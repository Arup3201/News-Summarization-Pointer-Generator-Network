Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a mass shooting in her Arizona district two years ago, met with Newtown officials on Friday afternoon before heading to visit with families of the victims of last month's Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

Giffords arrived at Newtown's town hall shortly before 3p.m. and met with First Selectman Pat Llodra and School Superintendent Janet Robinson among other officials.

After about 30 minutes, Giffords and a small entourage boarded their vehicles and drove off from the town hall.

On Thursday, Steven Jensen, spokesman for Connecticut Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, said Giffords planned to attend a private event at a local home on Friday.

Giffords' visit is three weeks to the day since 20-year-old Adam Lanza burst into Sandy Hook Elementary School in rural Newtown, about 70 miles northeast of New York City, and killed 20 first graders and six school staff members.

Anniversary: Giffords' visit to Newtown comes three weeks after the tragic shooting and almost two years to the day since she was shot in Arizona

Before the attack, Lanza killed his 
mother, Nancy Lanza, in their home about 5 miles from the school. Lanza 
took his own life as police arrived at the Sandy Hook school.

Giffords retired from Congress last year to focus on her recovery from the January 2011 shooting in Tucson that left six dead and 12 others wounded.

Giffords was shot in the head, left partially blind, with a 
paralyzed right arm and brain injury, when a gunman opened fire at a 
constituent meet-and-greet outside a Tucson grocery store on January 8, 
2011.

Back to school: On Thursday, the more than 400 Sandy Hook Elementary School children, some of whom are pictured, who escaped without physical harm returned to class at their new location for the first time since the assault

Arizona's chief federal judge and five others were killed and 12 
people, in addition to Giffords, were wounded.

Giffords has become a symbol for proponents of stricter gun control in the national debate about the right to bear arms, which has grown louder since the December 14 attack in Newtown.

On Thursday, the more than 400 children who escaped without physical harm returned to school for the first time since the assault.
