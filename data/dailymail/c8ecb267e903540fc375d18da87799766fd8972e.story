Tens of thousands of people are putting themselves at risk of stroke by dismissing early warning signs as a ‘funny turn’, experts say.

Mini-strokes – also known as transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) – are often a precursor to a potentially fatal major stroke.

Common symptoms such as arm weakness, slurred speech and blurred vision are often written off by sufferers as sciatica or a migraine.

However, one in 12 people who have a TIA will go on to suffer a full-blown stroke within a week.

Every year, 46,000 people in Britain have a mini-stroke for the first time.

If these were treated properly, around 10,000 strokes a year could be prevented and the NHS could save more than £200million, according to the Stroke Association’s report, Not Just A Funny Turn.

Jon Barrick, chief executive of the Stroke Association, said: ‘The greatest risk of having a major stroke is within the first few days after a mini-stroke. However, for many people it doesn’t feel like an emergency because the symptoms are brief.

‘Too many mini-stroke patients delay calling 999 when their symptoms start and instead book a GP appointment or visit their optician because of their visual symptoms.’

The charity’s report found that one in three people who had a mini-stroke in the past five years thought it was just a ‘funny turn’.

Only one in five rang 999 and almost half said the symptoms did not feel like an emergency. But one in five then went on to have a stroke.

What to watch for

The charity questioned 670 people for the report, which was supported by Legal & General.

And a quarter of those surveyed said healthcare professionals had not recognised the symptoms as those of a TIA.

More than a fifth said they were not given any information about lifestyle changes they needed to make to prevent a stroke.

Strokes can affect even the seemingly fit and healthy, as father of four Simon Bird, 53, discovered.

He had a TIA one evening in October 2011.

He said: ‘I was clearing the dishes away after dinner with my wife, Tricia, when I felt a sudden numbness in my left arm and couldn’t get my words out. I had to sit down. But it was over within about 30 seconds.’

Mr Bird was taken to hospital, where a specialist confirmed he had had a mini-stroke. It was a huge shock, given his age and healthy lifestyle. ‘I had lost weight, my diet was good and I was in training for a 100km cycle ride,’ he said.

The mini-stroke was caused by atrial fibrillation, a condition which affects heart rhythm and increases risk of blood clots, which in turn raises risk of stroke and TIA.

Mr Bird was put on medication to manage the condition and prevent a stroke. ‘I dread to think what could have happened if I had ignored it and just put it down to a “funny turn”.’
