What could be more heart-breaking than for your beloved dog to disappear one day, never to return, and for you never to find out what happened?

But that is what is now possible as a result of a decision by the Highways’ Agency, which used to stipulate that any dog found dead on a major road should be checked for identification and, where possible, the owner informed of the animal’s fate.

To save costs, the agency’s new contracts do not include such mandatory checks, although any driver who hits a dog is required by law to report the incident to the police.

Keeping them close: Devoted Jenni Murray cuddles two of her chihuahuas

Clearly this doesn’t always happen, which is what led Jude Devine from Sheffield to spend 13 agonising weeks searching for her miniature poodle Harvey, who had gone missing while she was visiting friends.

Eventually she was told by a kind Highways Officer that Harvey had been found dead on the M62 only 20 minutes after he had gone missing.

If only someone had told her at the outset, it would have saved her three months of desperate anxiety and the £8,000 she spent on living in a caravan close to the search area.

That’s how much an owner can love a dog. It’s for that reason she is calling for the Department of Transport to introduce a ‘Harvey’s Law’ to require compulsory scanning of any domestic animal found on a road and make sure a report is filed with the police.

It will seem ridiculous to anyone who doesn’t understand what a dog can mean to its owner to make a comparison with a child, but I’m going to do it with my dog.

No one would dream of suggesting that a child hit by a car should simply be disposed of without anyone being required to inform the parents and, I believe, the same caring attitude should apply to the demise of a dog.

I know exactly what Jude Devine went through when Harvey disappeared without trace. My first dog was a corgi-cross called Taffy. After much pestering and endless reading of Enid Blyton’s Shadow The Sheepdog, Mum finally relented and Taffy, a tiny, ginger pup with floppy ears and a long waggy tail, was my fifth birthday present.

We went everywhere together. We walked in the woods and loafed in the garden. He chased the balls I threw and sat when I told him to.

He was not, unlike Enid Blyton’s Shadow, allowed to sleep on my bed, but I did sneak him into the bedroom and he lay on the rug by my side.

Microchips can be used to identify a lost or dead dog and notify families

For an only child he was the most devoted and constant companion. He was never cross with me, always deliriously excited to see me (he even went to the door when he knew I was due home) and, as I grew into a teenager, he was my confidant.

He listened intently as I poured out my troubles and licked me profusely as a comfort. He always knew when I was worried or sad.

He was desolate when I went away to university. He was 13 years old and Mum would always include his moods in her letters. ‘Taffy miserable — looking forward to the end of term!’ I missed him terribly.

It was when I came home at Christmas in my third year that there was no enthusiastic welcome from Taffy.

He’d gone out through the back door the night before and hadn’t come home.

Dad initially joked he’d probably found a girlfriend, but I knew instinctively he hadn’t gone out temporarily. There was an air of finality about his disappearance.

I spent the entire Christmas fruitlessly hunting around the area, sorrowfully weeping at the thought that he may have been hit by a car or locked into someone’s shed and could be cold, hungry or in pain. At the end of the holiday I had to return to my studies and never knew what happened.

Dad said he’d probably gone off to die quietly in a ditch because he was old and didn’t want to upset me by dying in front of me or having to go to the vet for a lethal injection.

I was inconsolable and for years felt the absence of the dog I’d loved so much whose end remains a mystery. I remember my grief as if it were yesterday. It was 44 years ago.

It was two or three years before I plucked up the courage to have another dog.

A friend of my first husband, Brian Murray, had a yellow Labrador which had pups. They were irresistible.

We took one and called him Chivas after Brian’s favourite tipple — the whisky, Chivas Regal. He was a similar colour. There’s no doubt in those early years of marriage he was something of a child substitute.

Road workers are no longer obliged to check the collar or microchip of a dog that has been run over – and bodies can be disposed of without worried families being informed

We played with him and walked him in every spare moment. He was loyal and, like Taffy, always an unconditionally welcoming presence when we returned home.

We were careful never to let him out on his own, but one day, I popped out to the garden to pick some flowers, let my concentration slip for just a second and he was gone.

I chased after him, calling his name, but he ignored me and was much faster than I was. He was heading for the main road.

By the time we had organised to get in the car and hunt for him there was a knock on the door and a shocked, white-faced man explained his car had hit our dog. He said that he’d found our address on his collar and was sorry but thought Chivas was dead.

We hardly knew what to do. We picked up his blanket, drove to where the man had told us he’d left him and found his lifeless body at the side of the road. There wasn’t a mark on him, but it was obvious the impact had killed him outright.

We called the vet who simply told us to take him to the rubbish tip. I cradled him as my husband drove and when we arrived at the tip we met the same callous attitude demonstrated by the vet.

‘Oh, just dump it over there’ said one of the workmen. ‘We’ll incinerate it later’. It was a terribly thoughtless way to deal with two young people whose grief was palpable and we both wept all the way home.

There have been other dogs since. In fact, I’ve never been without them. Now my beloved babies — yes, I openly admit they’re child substitutes now my children are grown up — are the chihuahuas Butch, Frida and Madge and I learned a hard lesson with Taffy and Chivas.

My three are micro-chipped, never allowed out alone — except into my completely dog-proofed garden — and never permitted to run free on a walk except in the wilds of the countryside far from any roads.

And so, I support the call for Harvey’s Law. Losing Chivas was heartbreaking, but we were grateful to the driver who’d taken the trouble to set our minds at rest.

It’s true that it’s better to know the worst than to spend a lifetime wondering — and, surely, a civilised country can spare the small sum of money needed to make that possible.
