The Obamas are packing their bags for their annual holiday vacation to Hawaii, scheduled to last 17 days this year.

The first family will leave Washington, D.C. on Friday for the president's native state and won't return until Jan. 4, the White House has said. 

It is not yet known where they stay this year, though they have traditionally rented out a property on Oahu island.

During their year-end trips to the Hawaiian islands the Obamas typically lounge around their rental home, venturing out only on occasion for  shaved ice and dinner with their friends. First Lady Michelle Obama revealed on Monday that it's her Christmas wish to spend this year's holiday sleeping in late.

This year will be their seventh year vacationing in Hawaii for Christmas

The Obamas, including dogs Bo and more recently Sunny, have spent every Christmas since Barack was elected to president visiting the his birth place, Honolulu, which is coincidentally located in the beautiful Hawaiian islands.

For the past three years they have stayed on the most populous island, Oahu, in the wealthy Kailua neighborhood. 

In addition to culinary excursions the president generally spends his time on the golf course or working out at a local Marine Corps base.

He and the first lady usually make a special trip to the base to to wish the troops stationed there a Merry Christmas and to thank them for their service, as well.

Last year the Obama family also went on two hikes, two beach trips, a snorkeling expedition and visited the Honolulu zoo during their 17-day trip.

Their six previous trips have lasted between two and two and a half weeks and cost taxpayers roughly $4 million, government watchdogs have estimated, even with the Obamas paying for their own accommodations, which cost them $56,000 in 2013.

Taxpayers picked up the tab for as at least seven other homes in the area that Secret Service and White House staff stayed in, however.

A 2012 trip cost even more - $7 million - Watchdog.org found, after the president accompanied his family to Honolulu, Hawaii, for five days, then rushed back to Washington to help negotiate a deal to keep the country from falling off the 'fiscal cliff.'

After spending several days at the White House, Obama then returned to Hawaii to pick up his family and finish out his vacation.  

Earlier this year the president's two-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard was interrupted by a series of domestic and international crises and the president ended up having to work on many days set aside for relaxation on the Massachusetts island.

He also returned to Washington, D.C. for two days during that getaway, without his wife, for meetings at the White House. 

This year's winter vacation promises to be much less stressful, as Congress has already approved a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill to fund the government through the end of this fiscal year.

A favorite past time of Obama both at home an on vacation in Hawaii is golfing. He is pictured here shaking hands with the crowd gathered at the 18th green after playing a round at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii on December 29, 2008 a month and a half after being elected president

The first lady said on Monday that she's looking forward to getting a good night's sleep while on her upcoming holiday.

Obama was at the Washington, D.C. medical center to read children the classic Christmas tale Twas the Night Before Christmas and to answer their questions on Monday when a patient asked her what she wanted this year, according to CBS News.

'I don’t really have a long wish list for Christmas, because I pretty much have everything I need,' she responded.

'I just want everybody to be happy, and I want to sleep in. That’s what I want for Christmas. I want to sleep late. Maybe I’ll get that,' she continued. 

After the first lady's initial answer another child inquired as to whether she had Christmas-themed sleepwear.

'Maybe that’s what I should put on my Christmas list,' Mrs. Obama said told the group that had gathered to listen to her read at Children’s National Health System hospital.

'OK, Mr. President, if you’re watching, I think we could use some Christmas pajamas. That’s a good idea,' she said.

Earlier that day her husband had admitted that he struggles with buying her gifts she'll like - particularly clothes - while talking to radio and TV personality Ryan Seacrest 

'Michelle is hard to shop for,' he told the American Idol host during a radio interview that was taped Friday but aired on Monday.

'She's very fashionable and she looks good,,' he said, per USA Today. 'So I'm worried about buying her clothes because she'll, on Christmas Day, look at it and say, "That's really sweet, honey,"  and peck me on the cheek -- and I never see her wear what I bought.'
