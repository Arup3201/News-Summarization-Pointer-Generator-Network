Ofsted chief: Sir Michael Wilshaw said the move was a 'logical' progression

Schools are facing no-notice spot checks from Ofsted in a move which will effectively prevent teachers from 'hiding' unruly pupils from inspectors.

Inspectors will start making unannounced visits later this year in a bid to get a true picture of performance in schools.

The system shake-up comes less than a week after allegations surfaced claiming that some disruptive pupils are being bribed up to £100 to stay away from lessons during Ofsted inspections.

All schools will face the no-notice inspections from this autumn, the new Ofsted chief announced today.

Sir Michael Wilshaw said the move was a
'logical' progression, adding that it was vital that the public had 
confidence in inspections.

However, school leaders warned they had 'real doubts' that the plans would 
improve inspections, and raised concerns that the change had been 
announced without consulting headteachers.

Sir
Michael, who took up his post as chief inspector last week, said the 
introduction of new guidelines for inspections provided a 'good 
opportunity' to cut the notice period given to schools.

He said: 'We are introducing no-notice inspections for all schools from this September, not just those that are causing concern.

'There
are a number of reasons. First of all it’s a logical progression from 
the situation years ago when there was a year’s notice, then it was two 
weeks, and in 2005 it went to two days.

'That’s one reason. The second is we have a new framework, which is really important, that’s just come in.

'It
provides an opportunity for inspectors to do what’s really important - 
going in and inspecting quality, particularly teaching.'

Under the new guidelines, inspectors no longer have to spend time going through documentation before visits, he said.

The launch of Ofsted’s new Parent View website means that parents do not have to be sent questionnaires before an inspection as they can give their views year round.

Sir Michael added: 'There’s no reason why they can’t go in and go straight into the classroom in the first hour of the visit.'

He acknowledged that it was vital that the public has 'absolute confidence in the integrity of inspections'.

Last week fresh concerns were raised that some schools were attempting to trick Ofsted by using tactics such as sending weak teachers and unruly pupils home when inspectors were visiting.

He said: 'We want to make sure that the public views the process as something that’s rigorous and robust and there’s no question that schools are not going to follow the rules.'

He added that the 'great majority of 
schools conduct themselves properly', but said if there is any sense 
that a school is not, then Ofsted needs to deal with it.

Sir Michael admitted that some schools may be wary of the change, saying: 'In my experience, anything that’s new is going to be treated with some nervousness by schools.'

Once the process is established he said he believes it will be accepted.

Sir Michael said he wants inspectors to spend 'as much time as possible in the classroom'.

He added: 'I don’t want them to spend a huge amount of time looking at documentation, there’s too much of that, I want them to go in and observe lessons.'

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: 'We welcome moves to improve the effectiveness of inspection, but I have real doubts that no-notice inspection will accomplish this.

'Why has he announced this significant change before that important consultation with school leaders has taken place?'

'An effective inspection system is based on mutual trust and respect, not the premise that schools are trying to "cheat" and need to be caught out. If it is going to lead to improvement, inspection needs to be done with schools rather than used as a beating stick.'

He added: 'We welcome Sir Michael’s commitment to engage with the profession to improve the effectiveness of Ofsted, but that begs the question why he has announced this significant change before that important consultation with school leaders has taken place.'

Earlier this week it was claimed that disruptive pupils were being bribed up to £100 each to stay away from lessons during Ofsted inspections.

Despite
having good attendance records, poorly-behaved students are being paid 
to truant to prevent their schools getting bad ratings, it was alleged.

Such underhand tactics are being increasingly used to trick inspectors, according to teachers.

Other methods include headteachers 
‘borrowing’ outstanding staff from neighbouring schools to take lessons 
while telling their own weak teachers to go off sick.

Some also take 
brilliant artwork on loan from other schools to impress inspectors.

Ofsted has carried out about 1,500 unannounced inspections in the last 18 months of schools which were causing concern.

This included a pilot of no-notice visits to schools where there were concerns about behaviour.

And Sir Michael said the feedback from these inspections had been 'very, very positive'.

He will formally announce the move to no-notice inspections as part of a package of reforms in a speech early next week.

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: 'It is disturbing to see Ofsted change its position in a matter of days and suggests the policy has been created with an eye more to the soundbite than the evidence.

'If a school could conceal evidence of widespread failure in just two days, then the whole concept of inspection is flawed and Ofsted's protestations that it examines progress and behaviour over the long-term ring hollow.'

Nansi Ellis, head of education policy at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: 'While we totally agree that teachers should be held accountable for how well they teach, tinkering with the amount of notice for inspections will not improve education for the vast majority of children and young people.

'We also remain deeply concerned about the use of the online Parent View questionnaire.

'Any survey which allows people to 'opt-in' is likely to attract more critical responses than positive ones, and this one is unlikely to reflect the education most children receive at a school.'
