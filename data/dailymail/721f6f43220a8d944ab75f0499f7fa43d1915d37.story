Former far-right leader Tommy Robinson controversially appeared at Oxford Union last night - and told students fears over racism led to child abuse in Rotherham. 

Mr Robinson was the leader of the English Defence League - a group that been accused of inciting racial hatred and 'Islamophobia' - but he stood down last year.

His invitation to speak at the famous university had been criticised by his opponents and 200 people signed a petition calling for the event to be cancelled.

His appearance has been criticised by opponents, who claimed the Union was 'encouraging fascism'

A group of protesters - holding anti-fascist and trade union banners - stood outside the prestigious union last night and reportedly shouted abuse at Mr Robinson as he arrived.

Mr Robinson, who was jailed for mortgage fraud earlier this year but is out on licence, claimed he was given a list of things he 'couldn't say' by probation officers.

The 32-year-old - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - told MailOnline: 'Even though I wouldn't have been breaking any laws, I was told I would be taken back to prison if I spoke about the police.'

He insisted the atmosphere inside the union was 'civilised' and he was not heckled during his one-hour, twenty-minute speech.

Mr Robinson told students about the roots of the EDL and claimed it was a response to the 'religious intolerance' of some Muslims in his home town of Luton, Bedfordshire.

Talking about recent  child abuse revelations in Rotherham, he said: 'Fear paralysed Rotherham’s police force, the media and the politicians. The police facilitated the rape of children for 20 years because they were afraid of being called racist.'

He claimed Woodhill Prison, where he was sent after being jailed in January, is an 'ISIS training camp' where 'the radicals are running the wings'.

Mr Robinson is the latest controversial guest of the union, which previously invited Nick Griffin to talk

The union, which has previously hosted BNP leader Nick Griffin, had been strongly criticised for allowing Mr Robinson to appear.

A letter by Oxford Unite Against Facisim stated: 'By inviting Tommy Robinson the Oxford Union is contributing to a climate of Islamophobia which only encourages fascists onto the streets of Oxford.

'The Oxford Union should not be giving racists and Islamophobes the prestige of speaking at their institution and we demand Robinson's invitation is withdrawn.'

But students at the university have taken to Twitter to defend the decision, insisting the talk was in the interests of free speech.

Some students on the social network this morning stated that they did not agree with Mr Robinson's views on Islam, but were pleased to they had heard him speak.
