Three siblings who sparked a nationwide manhunt after allegedly pulling off a daring bank robbery were today sentenced to decades in prison.

Stripper Lee Grace Dougherty and her two brothers were convicted of firing shots at police officers as they were arrested in Colorado, and now face extradition to Georgia to stand trial over the heist which marked the start of their multistate crime spree.

Lee Grace admitted she had shown 'poor judgment' in leading her younger siblings on the nine-day rampage.

Plea: Dylan Stanley-Dougherty weeps as he argues for a lighter sentence over his role in a shoot-out with police

Ryan Dougherty was given 18 years in prison, Lee Grace received 24 years, and Dylan Stanley-Dougherty got 32 years. Prosecutors say Dylan, 27, was the one who fired at officers pursuing the siblings before their capture on August 10.

The hearings effectively end the siblings' six-month stay in Colorado jails as Georgia authorities await their extradition.

The three were the focus of a cross-country search last year after authorities said they fired at a police officer in Florida and robbed a Georgia bank. The search ended with a police chase in Colorado, where shots were fired at officers before the siblings' car rolled and crashed into a guard rail.

Lee Grace, 29, had faced up to 28 years in prison after pleading guilty to first-degree assault and two counts of menacing in the Colorado case. In court on Monday, the judge told her that as the oldest of the three siblings, she should have shown better judgment.

'I'd like to say it was a lapse in judgment, but 10 days is not a lapse in judgment,' Lee Grace replied. 'It was bad, poor judgment.'

All three are expected to soon be transported to Albany, Georgia, where they face a court hearing on May 15.

In the robbery case, witnesses say two men and a woman, dressed in black and wearing masks, entered a bank in Valdosta, Georgia on August 2 and fired shots into the ceiling.

One carried an assault rifle and an automatic pistol, similar to weapons recovered after the siblings' capture.

The trio made off with about $5,200 and had spent about $1,000 of it by the time police caught up with them in Colorado, authorities said.

The three also are charged with firing shots at a police officer in Zephyrhills, Florida, some 210 miles south of Valdosta, during a high-speed chase earlier on August 2.

In Florida, the siblings are charged with fleeing or eluding and attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer. Convictions could mean life sentences, according to court officials. 22-year-old Ryan also is charged with grand theft auto.

Florida authorities said the three had been living together in Lacoochee, Florida, about 45 miles northeast of Tampa, and each had a criminal record.

Before the alleged crime spree, Ryan was sentenced to register as a sex offender for sending sexually explicit text messages to an 11-year-old girl. His mother said her son feared the conviction would prohibit him from seeing his newborn son.

Lee Grace said in court that her actions were prompted by her desire to protect Ryan.

'My motivation in all of this is I could not lose another sibling,' she said, referring to a sister who died of an illness. 'He's not only my brother. He is my best friend.'

Dylan's lawyer, Kobea Becker, also portrayed his client as a loyal family member who was desperate to help his younger brother.

But judge Claude Appel said this argument was not a sufficient explanation for the criminal rampage.

'You're saving your brother from a probation sentence, for crying out loud, not a prison sentence,' he said of the siblings' efforts to prevent Ryan from having to register.

Later, Mr Appel told Ryan that the plan they tried to pull off only works in the movies.

'In reality, this is how the movie ends, serving very lengthy sentences,' the judge said.

Bruce Bartlett, chief assistant state attorney for Florida's 6th Judicial District, said authorities there also are seeking extradition.

'We'll be seeking sentences that ensure they spend most of their life in prison, if not all of it, so if and when they were to get out of prison they would no longer pose a threat to everyone,' he said.

Ryan told authorities in Colorado that the trio hoped to escape to Mexico.

Lee Grace was shot in the knee when she pointed a gun at a police officer after the trio rolled their car on Interstate 25 in Colorado.

Prosecutors say Dylan was the one who fired an assault rifle at pursuing officers before the siblings' capture in Colorado, and was also the one who fired at a police officer in Florida and a bank robbery in Georgia. During the hearing, he told the judge he was sorry and didn't want to hurt anyone.

'It is true that I acted out of desperation, and I am sorry for choices that I made,' he said.
