A northeast Ohio bridal store linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson has put its building up for sale after announcing plans to close.

Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October.

The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back.

On Friday she announced on the shop's Facebook page that the bank has now cut off the business credit line, forcing her to sell the building for $338,000.

The store, located at 1220 E. Tallmadge Ave., is listed with Cutler Real Estate. 

Particulars describe it as a 'great 4,000 sq ft brick retail building, built in 1996 with eye-catching curb appeal.

'The space would be ideal for beauty shop, message facility, auto parts store, doctors/dentist office, day-care center or veterinarian with plenty of parking.'

Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit the press.

She claims that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000.

The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses.

Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful.

'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.'

Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson asked for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses.

Miss Vinson, who recovered from Ebola nine days after treatment, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney.

Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'.

In January she posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down.

'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me.

'Over the years I have met and worked with the most amazing brides, mothers of brides, bridesmaids, prom girls and many other wonderful people.

'I want to thank all our customers, the people in our community and the well wishers from afar for being so supportive. Your kind words and loyalty have been great comfort.

'I also want to thank my amazing staff for all of their hard work and dedication to our customers and our business. I appreciate your understanding and support.'

One of the four staff members losing their jobs, Kayla Litz, told NewsNet5 that the Ebola scare had been particularly worrying for her because she was in her first trimester of pregnancy at the time.

Ms Litz came through the quarantine period of 21 days Ebola-free along with the other employees of the store.  

The store is still filling orders that were made through January and plans to shut for good in May.

Akron officials had considered ideas to help relocate or save the store, but its operators said they didn't plan to take the city up on that offer.
