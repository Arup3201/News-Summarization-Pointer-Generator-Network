A Florida man grew tired of his parrot’s constant squeeks for attention, so built him a robot car to shut him up.

Andrew Gray, a 29-year-old computer engineering student, build the small electric buggy for African grey parrot Pepper so he could entertain himself and quiet down.

After trying different solutions to the Pepper-related noise issue, including a sound activated water gun and a remote controlled drum, he came up with the beak-operated car.

Off-road: Pepper the parrot driving his electric Bird Buggy

It was when Mr Gray was on leave from the Navy that the noise made by family pet Pepper became too much to bear.

The first solution, a noise-activated water gun intended to deter the bird from making noise had a completely different result.

'Eventually it became a bird bath, and Pepper would start making noise just to get sprayed,’ he told ABC News.

After another failed invention, the drum, which did everything but deter Pepper, he built the Bird Buggy.

‘I realized the bird needed to be around people constantly. He just needed to be in the same room.’

Pepper operates the Bird Buggy himself, steering a joystick in four directions with his beak.

The buggy has an infra-red camera as well as bumper sensors so Pepper can safely steer around the house without crashing into walls.

Top speed: Now that he is busy enjoying his new ride, Pepper is a lot quieter

‘He knows how to drive, forwards, backwards, left and right.’ Mr Gray told ABC News. ‘He loves his new toy.’

A video of Pepper and his ride  has become a YouTube favourite with 800,000 views in just over a month.

Although the new quiet version of Pepper is a blessing to the whole family, Mr Gray hopes that the publicity of his invention may lead him to a job.
