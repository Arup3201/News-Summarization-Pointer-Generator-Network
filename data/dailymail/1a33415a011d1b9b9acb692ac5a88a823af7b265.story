Middlesbrough are closing on a deal for Genk striker Jelle Vossen after he was left out of their game with KV Mechelen on Sunday.

Although there were reports of an injury, the 25-year-old is expected to hold talks with Middlesbrough this week if they can agree compromise on the £5m price.

Vossen played 38 times for Genk last season, scoring 12 goals in the process. In the preceding three seasons he managed to score 57 league goals from 105 games, which works out at 0.54 goals per game.

Pricetag: Genk are holding out for a fee of around £5m, which is more than Middlesbrough want to pay

The Yorkshire club are in dire need of a goal-scoring, despite having six strikers on their books last season, none managed to make it in to double figures.

Meanwhile, Middlesbrough have officially re-signed Nigerian centre-back Kenneth Omeruo from Chelsea on loan.

The 20-year-old told BBC sport: ‘I decided to return to Boro because I really enjoyed my last loan there and working with the manager Aitor Karanka.

‘I like the atmosphere at Middlesbrough, the players and fans too are very supportive.

‘It's such an easy choice to make and a key factor in going there is the chance to play first-team football.’

Form: Genk's 25-year-old striker has scored 59 goals for Genk in the last four seasons

Return: Kenneth Omeruo has re-signed with Middlesbrough after a successful spell last season
