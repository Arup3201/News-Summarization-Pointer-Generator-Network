Philadelphia Eagles legend Chuck Bednarik died Saturday following a brief illness. He was 89.

Bednarik, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and one of the last outstanding two-way NFL players, passed away at an assisted living facility in Richland, Pennsylvania, the team announced.

Bednarik played a franchise-record 14 seasons with the Eagles from 1949 to 1962 and was part of two NFL championship teams in 1949 and 1960.

He delivered a legendary performance in the 1960 NFL Championship Game, playing nearly every minute at both linebacker and center against the Green Bay Packers. With seconds remaining in the game and Packers running back Jim Taylor headed for the end zone, Bednarik made a game-saving tackle as time ran out, preserving a 17-13 Eagles victory.

The Eagles tweeted a tribute to Bednarik, calling him "Forever an Eagle," with the 1960 iconic photo of him towering over New York Giants running back Frank Gifford, who was knocked out on a devastating hit by the linebacker.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967, his first year of eligibility.
