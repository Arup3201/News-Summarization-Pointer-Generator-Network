Lynwen started weaving loom bands to make colourful bracelets for herself and her daughter, but soon wanted a larger challenge

One mother has got her holiday swimwear sorted - after making a bikini out of loom bands.

Lynwen Stonelake, 25, from Swansea, South Wales, spent months making the colourful two-piece from the little plastic rings.

The mother-of-one started making little bracelets for herself and her daughter, Lexi, two, but soon decided to try something more challenging.

She said: 'I have always been quite arty and enjoyed making things.

'I was doing it for a little bit, but wasn't really massively into it.

'I thought it would be fun to make a bikini out of them, but I didn't think it could be done.

'Then I saw that someone had made a dress out of them, and I decided to give it a go.

'I made it completely from scratch and it took weeks - and three separate attempts before I cracked it!

'A lot of people said I must have a lot of patience to do it, it was very fiddly.'

Now Lynwen hopes she'll be able to sell the two-piece, and donate some of the money to charity.

'I would give some money to Cancer Research in memory of my grandfather, Alan Perrin.'

She said she has since made a crop top for her daughter, but said she was too young yet to have a go at making the loom bands herself.

The trend for clothing made out of out the simple children's toy began to grow after one women placed a dress made of the plastic bands on eBay for over a hundred thousand pounds.

Helen Smith, 42, couldn't believe her luck when a dress she made from 24,000 loom bands reached the high bid of £170,000 after she posted it on eBay. However unfortunately the dress did not sell for that amount as the buyer pulled out.

But that hasn't stopped more wannabe weavers being eager to follow suit and try to make a quick buck from their rubber band creations, with the online auction site being inundated with clothing and accessories made from the bright bands. A quick search reveals endless listings with some items having a price tag of more than £5,000.

Fashion fans have crafted everything from bikinis to belts and even high-heeled shoes from the rainbow-coloured elastic bands.

The first ever man's 'loomkini' also recently went up for sale on the site on sale at starting price of £30. The listing of a 'thong made from the popular bands' was originally taken down as the image broke eBay's nudity laws.

Even flip-flops and high heels created from the colourful bands are beginning to appear on eBay

The shoes aren't created entirely out of the bands but instead heels are decorated using the weave

For some of the weavers their creations are more than just a hobby. One listing advertised a bodycon boob-tube style dress being sold to raise funds for a big day.

The dress was designed by Dani Hubbard 26, from Porth in Rhonnda, who enlisted her family to help make the dress which took them a grand total of 39 hours to create.

Too much skin: Innes's original advertisement showed more of his figure than eBay allows (right) but his item has since been relisted and the 22-year-old is currently fetching bids over £50

Dani is hoping that her efforts will pay for her wedding to partner Jamie.

According to The Mirror newspaper Dani was hoping to have enough to set aside a little extra to help buy her brother a car to thank him for helping with the dress.

'It was my brother's idea to make such a fashionable dress, and he helped me decide on the particular style we ended up with after we had discussed it. I haven't seen anything on the internet like it.'

'I just thought that if the other lady could do it, then so can I. There's a huge craze going on at the moment with these bands, so I gave it a go' continued the hopeful bride-to-be.

However it appears that the increasing availability of loom band clothing is seeing the value of the garments decrease.

11-year-old Abigail Baker from Desborough, Northamptonshire, spent seven days crafting a loom band dress from 25,000 of the elastic bands.

Abigail used £90 worth of the bands and saw her dress go under the hammer for just £155. However the school girl seemed unscathed and thanked her family for the support.

'My family have 
been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £90 to make this 
dress and have supported me all the way.'

Unlike Dani, Abigail has much more humble plans for her loom band profit. She said she wanted to raise at least 
£50 cash so she could give her four-year-old brother Liam £10, keep £20 
for her to spend in the arcades and £20 for a fish and chip dinner 
treat while on holiday in Weymouth, Dorset, next month.
