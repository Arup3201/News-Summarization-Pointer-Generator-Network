They may be more used to scavenging in bins for their dinner but this friendly fox took a more direct approach to getting lunch - sharing a surprised birdwatcher's picnic.

The brazen vixen made a beeline for Richard Harris, 51, who was sitting in one of his favourite parks enjoying a spot of lunch.

Much to his surprise, Mr Harris held out some crisps in his hand and the young female took them from his fingers.

Surprise: Birdwatcher Richard Harris, 51, was sitting in one of his favourite parks enjoying a light lunch when the bushytailed creature ambled up

Hungry: To Richard's surprise the hungry fox tucked into some crisps

Snack: Mr Harris then gave the fox some nuts which were meant for the birds

Retired Mr Harris said: 'She came up and very carefully took my onion rings from me. I was amazed.

'This carried on until we had finished the entire packet, and she didn’t catch my fingers in her teeth once.

'I really didn’t think the fox would eat straight out of my hands without any hesitation.

'It’s a special moment I will remember for a long time.

'The bench I was sitting on at the time is my favourite now, because of what happened.'

The former music publisher, from Richmond, was visiting nearby Kew Gardens - a favourite haunt - to see jays, ringnecked parakeets and other garden birds.

After the fox had polished off the onion rings, Mr Harris started to hand her peanuts meant for his feathered friends.

His wife Sissel, 63, was on hand to capture the special moment on film.

Mr Harris said: 'I think the fox preferred the onion rings to be honest. I still can’t believe what happened, or the care she took.

'She was so sweet that I wasn’t worried about being nipped at all.'

The fantastic fox wasn't just there for the food, she kept the couple company for around half an hour even when the food had run out. 

Mr Harris said: 'I hope I will see her again one day, and that I have some more food with me to share.'

Bold: The fox wasn't shy, taken the snack straight from Richard's hand

Feast: The fox shared Richard's onion rings

Friendly: The fox stayed with Richard until the whole bag of onion rings was eaten
