Richard Hannon believes five-day Glorious Goodwood, which starts on July 29, could prove the key battleground in his son’s battle for the trainer’s title with John Gosden.

Hannon Snr is the most successful trainer in the history of the meeting, his nine successes last year taking his tally at the fixture to 73.

Meanwhile Hannon Jnr, who took over from his father at the start of the year, will be hoping the meeting proves as fruitful.

Picturesque: Glorious Goodwood in Sussex begins on July 29 and last for five days

His sizeable raiding party to the Sussex course will see 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Palace disappointment Toormore dropping back a furlong to the Bet365 Lennox Stakes, in-form two-year-old Kool Kompany running in the Richmond Stakes and Beacon contesting the Molecomb Stakes.

Leading the team will be Toronado, who goes head-to-head with Gosden’s Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Palace Stakes winner Kingman in the Qipco Sussex Stakes.

That is the heavyweight clash of the meeting and one in which Hannon snr thinks his side can come out on top.

Hannon snr said: ‘Richard is only about £40,000 behind and a couple of nice winners at Goodwood would make a big difference.

Leader: Hannon Jnr's big name horse at Glorious Goodwood will be Toronado, who will be up against Kingman

‘Toronado hasn’t been easy. He has had two wind operations and he blew up half a furlong from home when he won the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot last month.

‘He is in good form and is as good a horse as we have had here – definitely on a par with (2010 Sussex Stakes winner) Canford Cliffs.

‘I am also not sure Kingman will like the track. We know we will, having won there already.’

Identifying unraced two-year-olds which could help the stable’s championship push, Hannon snr named Sir Alex Ferguson-owned Miracle Ninetynine and Coolmore Stid-owned Believe It.

Hannon, who saw Shifting Power finish third in yesterday’s Prix Jean Prat at Chantilly, will have the favourite in Saturday’s big race at Newbury, the Weatherby’s Super Sprint.

Glorious: Hannor Snr predicts that the meeting in Sussex will be a fantastic battleground

Spanish colt Noozhoh Canarias, who finished sixth in both the 2,000 Guineas and July Cup, has been switched from Madrid-based trainer Enrique Leon to Carlos Laffon-Parias in France.
