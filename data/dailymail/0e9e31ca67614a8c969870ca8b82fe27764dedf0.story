A woman jailed for helping her killer husband dispose of their dead babysitter’s body wept as she told a parole board that she’s sorry for what she did and hopes that ‘being in hell helps’.

The victim’s mom was at the hearing but said later that she thought the board was being lied to.

Dea Millerberg, 41, was jailed for five years for helping her white supremacist husband Eric Millerberg bury the body of 16-year-old Utah girl Alexis Rasmussen after a night of babysitting spiralled into a sex and drug-fueled tragedy.

Prosecutors said the Millerbergs gave the teen drugs in exchange for babysitting services, and the three had a drug-fueled sexual relationship that led to Rasmussen's death from an overdose in 2011.

Eric was found to have recklessly injected Rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine.

Eric and Dea then dumped Alexis's body in the woods of northern Utah while lying to police as the girl's mother desperately searched for her for more than a month.

Dea tearfully told the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole this week that she was sorry for what she had done, Ksl.com reported.

She said: ‘I’m so sorry. It does hurt me to know I caused so much pain and anguish and hurt and anger. I feel like I do deserve to be here. I struggle daily with what I did. The longer I've been off drugs, the harder it is.

‘I hope my being here, somehow, helps in some way.’

A parole officer told her that she should be prepared to serve the full prison term. 

Alexis’s mom, Dawn Miera, refused to believe that Dea was being sincere.

She questioned why Dea didn’t help her find her daughter when she was reported missing.

She said: ‘I don't know if she really feels sorry. I don't know if this is really about her. I don't know if I can believe anything that she says.’

Eric Millerberg was sentenced to life for child abuse homicide - a first-degree felony and one to 15 years for obstructing justice, a second-degree felony.

He was also sentenced to two terms of zero to five years for the unlawful and statutory rape of a 16-or-17-year-old - and abuse or desecration of a human body, third-degree felonies.

The sentences are consecutive.

Eric Millerberg, 38, showed no sign of emotion when the judge sentenced him in 2014.

After Alexis died, Eric and Dea grabbed her body, stuffed it in to a trash bag, bundled it in the trunk of their car and dumped it in a remote rural location. The body was found 38 days later.

Dea said the couple started using Alexis - or Lexi as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011.

According to Salt Lake Tribune, Dea testified that on the night of the girl's death, she had picked up Alexis to babysit her kids.

She said as soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Eric Millerberg helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck.

Then, when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, the girl and Eric Millerberg performed oral sex on one another. Dea said that she was not involved in the encounter.

A short while later, the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom.

After leaving her alone in the bath at her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold, so Dea wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom.

The couple left her to smoke cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive.

‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Dea, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail.

They then tried to figure out what to do next.

‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court.

Eric Millerberg was on parole at the time for burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang.

The girl was found  in a fetal position, her lower half stuffed into a garbage bag.

Utah assistant medical examiner Joseph White testified that the girl’s body was so badly decomposed, it was difficult to identify her. Dental records and a fingerprint analysis finally led to a positive identification.

A toxicologist testified that reports showed she had ingested meth at least 24 hours before her death.
