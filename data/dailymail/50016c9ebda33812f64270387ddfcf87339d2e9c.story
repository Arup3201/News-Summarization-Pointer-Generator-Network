Authorities have released new video of a paranoid schizophrenic woman who has gone missing, possibly with her two young children.

The video shows Catherine Hoggle, 27, sneaking out the back of a Chick-fil-A in Germantown, Maryland, just moments after lying to her common-law husband, Troy Turner, about the whereabouts of their two children, 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle, and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle. 

Hoggle was then captured on video again at the Germantown Commons shopping center on Tuesday morning around 4:30 am. The children are not seen in the video.

Getting away: Catherine Hoggle, who has been missing along with her two children have been missing since earlier this week, is seen here sneaking out of a restaurant after lying to husband Tory Turner about the location of their children

Missing: Police said they have 'grave concerns' about the whereabouts of Hoggle, 27 and her two children, Sarah Hoggle, three, (left) and two-year-old Jacob Hoggle (right)

Turner contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing.

The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare.

Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center.

'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children.

Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7.

Searching: Troy Turner hands out flyers at a Germantown shopping center where his wife is known to frequent.

No clues: Hoggle is a paranoid schizophrenic

On Sunday, police say Hoggle took the children to her mother's Clarksburg house.

She said she was  going to take her son Jacob for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later, she did not have him with her.

Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police say Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since.

Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job.

Sarah was last seen on Monday at Hoggle's mother's home.  

Hoggle and Turner also have another son together, whose whereabouts is known.

Police described Hoggle as a white female, 5-feet-6-inches tall, 160 pounds, with brown eyes and shoulder length black hair.

She was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black tank top.

Officials said they hope that a friend is watching the children and does not know that police are hunting for them.
