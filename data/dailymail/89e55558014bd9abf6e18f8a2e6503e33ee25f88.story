New product Slim Rice is said to have only 7.7 calories per 100g compared to 350 calories in white basmati rice

For anyone trying to stick to a diet, carbohydrates are usually the enemy.

But one type of rice is flying off the shelves, because it has virtually no calories.

Slim Rice, a new British product, helps you feel full while barely registering on your waistline.

There are 7.7 calories in a 100g serving, compared to 350 calories in the same weight of white basmati rice.

Regular boiled rice contains 64 per cent water. Slim Rice, which comes already cooked, is made up of 97 per cent water and the Asian root konjac.

Some nutritionists claim that vegetable 
extract konjac – also known as Moyu – can stabilise blood-sugar levels 
and prevent hunger pangs and over-eating.

The unusual product smells strongly of starch and needs to be rinsed at least twice under warm water to remove its distinctive odour.

Advocates claim the rice, which is chewier than normal varieties, tricks your brain into thinking you have eaten a full meal.

One portion can create the sensation of being full for up to four hours.

The Slim range – which includes Slim Pasta and Slim Noodles – is flavourless, allowing you to add a sauce of your choice.

Made by company Eat Water, it is available from Holland & Barrett and independent food stores and costs £2.55 a packet.

However, Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘There are nasty side effects to konjac.  It will make you feel fuller but doesn’t do much for you.

‘Konjac is an appetite suppressant and 
people will eat it thinking they will get slim but might not be aware 
they could be starving themselves of nutrients.

‘You don’t want to starve your body of things that it needs.’
