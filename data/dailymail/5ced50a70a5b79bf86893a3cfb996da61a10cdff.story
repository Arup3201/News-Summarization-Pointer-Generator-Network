He might have a farmer for a father but Prince Harry looked slightly ill at ease when confronted with an enormous bull during a visit to the Suffolk County Show in Ipswich this afternoon.

Nothing daunted, the royal carried on chatting to its owner - even when the Red Poll began to beadily roll its eyes. Luckily for Harry, the rest of the animals at the showground proved less intimidating, with the prince even crouching down for a cuddle with one calf.

Afterwards, the prince was taken to meet a flock of prize-winning sheep and this time, eagerly squatted down for a closer look. Then, after a chat with the animal's excited young owner, Harry beamed as he posed for a photo with the junior shepherd.

Fright night: Prince Harry maintains a safe distance from the beady-looking Red Poll bull while he chats to its owner during a visit to the Suffolk Show

Hello there: The two bulls were kept on a tight leash by their owners who had gathered in the parade ring ahead of their visit from the prince

No touching! This smaller bull seemed less than impressed to meet Prince Harry and even frothed at the mouth as the royal visitor approached

Much better! An adorable calf found more favour with the prince, who crouched down to say hello - much to the delight of its handlers

During his tour of the show, which also received a royal visit from his mother Princess Diana in 1986, the prince was also introduced to a Suffolk Punch horse, a traditional breed of heavy horse that is now considered endangered.

After giving the animal a friendly pat, the prince met troops from his former base at Wattisham Flying Station
 before completing his whistle-stop tour of Suffolk by enjoying a parade of Royal British Legion standards through the showground.

Harry's day had started more than six hours earlier with an appearance at a coaching session run by Inspire Suffolk, a charity that aims to help under-privileged children.

Asked to join in, the prince obliged with alacrity but typically, pulled out all the stops to win a penalty shoot out against a group of excited Suffolk school children.

Lights, camera... Prince Harry looked on suave form, despite the miserable weather, and stopped to pose for a photo with one young fan - and his flock of sheep

Tastes good! After inspecting the livestock, Prince Harry then continued on to the food tents, where he met children busily preparing pizzas

Cooking lesson: The prince beamed as he listened to instructions from the class teacher - perhaps a handy hint for future use at Kensington Palace

Grinning from between the goal posts, the prince took his goal-keeping duties seriously, ensuring that not one of the children lined up against him managed to score their penalty.

Despite his antics, nothing could dampen the children's enthusiasm, with his pint-sized opponents describing the royal visitor as a 'funny' chap who 'kept making lots of jokes'.

Harry, who
 is fresh from a successful three-day tour of Estonia and Italy, 
impressed local children with his talent for touch rugby and even took 
part in a game of football, although soon found himself on the receiving
 end of a powerful tackle.

'He tackled me and won the ball but I managed to tackle him back,' revealed nine-year-old Aryon Tandel, from Ipswich. 'He was taking it quite seriously.'

So that's how it's done! Prince Harry and a new young friend discuss the perfect toppings for a pizza - in this case mozarella, tomatoes, mushrooms and herbs

Ducking and diving: Prince Harry seemed to be enjoying himself during his stint in goal - during which not one ball slipped past him

Another young fan, Brandon Norman, eight, from Ipswich, managed to score a goal against Harry's team - much to his delight. 'He gave me a tap around the ear and said well done,' said the delighted boy.

The prince - who met the children during a
 visit to Inspire Suffolk, a community project in Ipswich - is the vice patron 
of the Rugby Football Union, and also took part in a game of rugby - which he took just as seriously as he did the football.

'He was funny and making lots of jokes,' revealed one nine-year-old opponent, George Hill from Ipswich. 'He told me I had to stay behind the ball and joked that if I went in 
front again he would slap me!'

Equally 
impressed was 11-year-old Jake Katz Roberts from Islington in north 
London, who was one of the few who managed to evade one of the prince's 
lunging tackles.

'He told me: "That's the last time you're going to skin me," revealed the young rugby player, adding: 'Harry was really fun and got stuck in.'

 right royal tackle! Prince Harry sticks his arm out to trip up one

 opponent
