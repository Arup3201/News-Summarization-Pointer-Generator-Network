Toro Rosso have announced rising young Spanish star Carlos Sainz Jnr will join their line-up for next season.

It means Toro Rosso will have one of the youngest driver pairings in Formula One history as 20-year-old Sainz will be joined by 17-year-old Max Verstappen.

The son of a former World Rally champion, Sainz earned his promotion into F1 after this year becoming the youngest driver to win the World Series by Renault 3.5 championship.

A delighted Sainz, who this week tested for Red Bull in Abu Dhabi, said: 'I am really happy to have landed the drive with Toro Rosso.

'Ever since I have been part of Red Bull's young driver programme this has been my aim, and I want to thank Red Bull for putting their faith in me.

'I have had a very successful season in World Series by Renault this year, and now I am looking forward to taking the step up to Formula One.

'In the next few months I will be working hard on my preparation, ready to get in the cockpit in Jerez for the first test of next year.

'It will be nice to make my 'official' debut as a Formula One driver in my home country.'

Team principal Franz Tost believes Sainz is fully deserving of his place in F1.

Tost said: 'With Carlos joining Max in our driver line-up we continue the Toro Rosso tradition of providing youngsters from the Red Bull junior programme with their first steps in Formula One.

'I have watched Carlos progress through the junior categories, always improving as he moved higher up the ladder, culminating in a well-deserved win in this year's World Series.

'However, I also remember the day's testing he did with us at Silverstone in 2013. He really surprised me and his engineers that day with his mature approach and his speed.'
