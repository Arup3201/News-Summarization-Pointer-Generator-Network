Tens of thousands of commuters on San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system have been warned to be on alert for measles.

It comes after an infectious LinkedIn employee took the train during the morning and evening commutes for three days last week. 

Officials said the patient also dined at E&O Kitchen and Bar, an Asian restaurant in San Francisco, on February 4.

The infected person was known to have traveled between the Lafayette station in the East Bay and the Montgomery station in San Francisco during the morning and evening rush-hour commutes on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week, BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost said.

That ride is 35 minutes long, but health officials said the highly infectious, airborne virus could have remained in the air for up to two hours. 

Given the BART cars circulate throughout the Bay area, tens of thousands of people could have potentially been exposed, Ms Trost added.

The infected rider, a LinkedIn employee who lives in Contra Costa County, also spent time at the E&O Kitchen and Bar last Wednesday evening, potentially exposing others who were in the restaurant between 5.30pm and 7pm, health officials said.

Public health officials said they were tracing the movements of the person, who is recovering and not hospitalized, and notifying others known to have had close contact.

Health officials said Wednesday that those without vaccinations who came into contact with the BART commuter are a 'high risk' of coming down with measles. 

People displaying symptoms are urged to seek medical attention immediately. 

Symptoms include high fever, runny noses, coughing and watery red eyes and can begin from one to three weeks after exposure. 

An infected person is contagious for several days before and after the rash appears.

Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. 

Health officials say the risk of vaccinated commuters contracting measles is 'highly unlikely.' People born before 1957 are considered immune. 

The state Department of Public Health said it does not know how many San Francisco Bay Area residents have measles vaccines. The number of parents declining to vaccinate their children has risen in the region - and the country - in recent years, though the majority is vaccinated. 

LinkedIn said in a statement it was informed on Tuesday an employee based in its San Francisco office was diagnosed with measles. The employee lives in Contra Costa County

More than 100 people in California and others in several states and Mexico have been infected with measles since an outbreak traced to Disneyland was first reported in December.

It is not known how the commuter contracted the disease. 

'The measles vaccine is very effective and is a standard part of pediatric primary care,' said Dr. Tomas Aragon, San Francisco Health Officer. 

'While we are concerned about the current outbreak in California and its potential to spread, we cannot emphasize enough that the solution is simple and available: be vaccinated.' 

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. 

But last year the country had its highest number of measles cases in 20 years. 

The majority of measles cases have been in California. The CDC has updated its information on the disease's spread and now 18 states are affected
