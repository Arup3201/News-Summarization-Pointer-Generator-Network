A 36-year-old woman who escaped police custody at a Pennsylvania hospital while pregnant has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a woman and her infant at knife point last year.

Billie Jo Ribble faces at least 20 years in prison when she is sentenced on June 25.

The New York woman was arrested last March in Mansfield on charges stemming from a 2012 burglary near her hometown of Bath.

Ribble, who told police she was seven months pregnant, was taken to the hospital in Wellsboro after complaining of stomach pains.

Police say Ribble assaulted her hospital guard, then jumped out a third-story window to a second-story rooftop and climbed down.

She kidnapped a Wellsboro woman and her six-month-old baby at knifepoint and made the woman drive her to New York, where she was captured in Corning.

Ribble's extensive criminal history first unfolded in March last year, when she was arrested in Mansfield on charges stemming from an October theft of 15 rifles and shotguns from a home in Howard, New York.

Steuben County sheriff's investigators had been tipped off she was meeting someone at the Walmart in Mansfield to receive 'travel money', Steuben County Undersheriff Jeffrey Allard said.

He said that when she arrived, she was taken into custody by Pennsylvania State Police.

After being arraigned in a Tioga County court on fugitive-from-justice charges, Ribble was being taken to jail that night when she complained of stomach pains related to her pregnancy, the undersheriff said.

Ribble, who told Allard she was seven months pregnant, was taken to a hospital in nearby Wellsboro.

At the hospital, officials said, she grabbed a chair or stool and hit a county correction officer. Ribble then jumped out a third-story window onto a second-story roof, where she used a ladder to reach the ground, authorities said.

She broke into the basement of a Wellsboro home where a woman and her six-month-old daughter were sleeping.

The woman was awakened by Ribble who was standing over her daughter's crib with a large butcher's knife.

Police said Ribble threatened to kill the woman, the child and herself if the woman didn't take her where she wanted to go.

The woman got into the driver's seat of her car and Ribble got into the front passenger seat, still holding the woman's daughter and the butcher's knife.

At Ribble's direction, the woman drove from Pennsylvania to an exit off Route 15 in Lindley, where Ribble was dropped off.

En route, Ribble used the woman's cellphone to call someone in Corning, New York.

Ribble disabled the woman's phone, he said, but the woman contacted police once she was back in Pennsylvania.

New York State Police were able to track Ribble's call to a home in Corning where she had lived previously. It was allegedly the home of her alleged boyfriend, Robert Bavisotto.

When police arrived at the home, Ribble fled to the attic, where she threatened to harm herself and her unborn child, Allard said. After about an hour of talking with police, Ribble surrendered, he said.

Bavisotto was last year charged with hindering prosecution.

Corning police said Ribble's arrest record in the city dates back to 2006, mostly for crimes involving drugs, weapons or assault.

Her New York prison record shows time spent at Albion Correctional Facility for a robbery conviction in 2003 and another stint for a parole violation. She was released from prison in January 2012.

Allard said she tried to elude arrest for the parole violation by jumping out a home's second-story window.

'She has a pretty good history of flight,' Allard said, adding that a network of family and friends helped her elude police over the past several months.

Allard said Ribble reported being pregnant with her first child. He didn't know if she was married.

The Leader of Corning reported that Ribble was a standout basketball player in the 1990s at nearby Campbell-Savona and Alfred State College in neighboring Allegany County.
