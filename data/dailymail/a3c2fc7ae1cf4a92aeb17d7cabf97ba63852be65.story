It was called the 'shaggin' wagon' and it embodied Australia's easy-going 1970s surf lifestyle.

Now, forty years after it was first launched, the Holden Sandman is back.

Holden will unveil its new model 'freedom machine' - complete with groovy, orange shag pile floor rug - at next weekend's Rip Curl Pro surfing competition at famous Bells Beach in Torquay, south-west of Melbourne.

The special edition 2015 Holden Sandman comes with the same retro body stickers, Sandman sunshades, dashboard stitching and custom interiors that made it so popular in the 70s

The 2015 Sandman will be available as a sports wagon or ute, but not as a panel van like the original 1970s model

'Son of the beach': The Holden Sandman became a symbol of Aussie surf culture and the great outdoors

An old favourite of Australian surfers, bohemians and young lovers and bad boys, the new special edition Sandman comes with the same retro colour stickers, Sandman sunshades, dashboard stitching and custom interiors that made it such a legend back in the day. 

But it won't be available as a panel van like it was in the 1970s. The 2015 model is based on the VF Commodore SV6 and the sporty SS-V, and comes as a ute or  sports wagon with V8 super car technology.

Holden is making just 250 of the new model which are expected to go on sale in June for between $42,950 and $52,950. The original sandman used to cost buyers  between $3500 and $5000.

'A personal pleasure machine:' Custom additions like the shag pile seat covers and floor rugs made the Sandman popular with young lovers in the 70s

Original advertising posters for the first Sandmans appealed to Australians' affinity with the surf and the great outdoors. 

'It's built for new horizons: powered to take you wherever you get the urge. You make your own frontiers with this baby,' the posters said. 'If you've got the call of the wild, we've got your answer!'

Holden branded the car 'Son of the beach'; The panel van and ute were perfect for throwing in the surfboards and camping on the sand dunes. 

Custom additions like the shag pile  seat covers and floor rugs turned the vehicle into a 'personal pleasure machine' ideal for the drive-in movies.

'Suddenly your van becomes a personal pleasure machine ... and it won't turn into a pumpkin if you're not home by midnight.' 

'Let the good times roll.' 

According to Mysandman.com.au, a website dedicated to the classic wagon, the Sandman was 'a warning to parents everywhere that your daughters were no longer safe going to the drive-ins.'

Peter Keley, Holden’s  Director of Sales,  says the opportunity to bring back the Sandman was irresistible.

'The Holden Sandman has been synonymous with the great Australian surf safari for decades and perfectly reflects our country’s laid back, yet adventurous attitude to life. When the opportunity came to revive Sandman, we jumped at it,' Mr Keley said.

'The reborn Sandman is a statement and reflection of the Australian way of life. Most importantly, it’s about having fun.'

Kate Burling, a long-time fan of the Holden wagon, says she can't wait to see the new model.

'My  first love at 17 was my Holden Kingswood, then it was the pano,' Ms Burling told Daily Mail Australia. 'I never owned a Sandman but I just love it, it's such a classic car for the ultimate  aussie road trip, I can't wait to see what the new one looks like.'

After more than twenty years in the darkness, Holden reinvented the Sandman as a concept ute at the Sydney International Motor Show, 2000. But the ute was discontinued in 2006 due to slow sales.

The 2015 Sandman launches on the heels of other recently revived Holden classics like the Collingwood Dore and Craig Lowndes, as the company tries to boost Commodore sales before it ends local production in 2017.

The limited edition Sandman wagon will be unveiled at the Rip Curl Pro surf competition at Bells Beach in Victoria next weekend

Holden spokesman  Sean Poppitt says the new Sandman is sure to be a hit with Holden fans at Bells Beach next weekend.

'I’m sure it will spark great memories for a lot of Australians and help create new memories for others,' he says. 'Let the good times roll again.'
