British spies targeted the Prime Minister of Israel, and other senior figures in the Israeli government, according to leaked documents.

Information from the cache of files released by Edward Snowden allegedly show that GCHQ, the British intelligence agency, had targeted an email account belonging to Ehud Olmert while he was in office.

The agency, working with the American NSA, also targeted defence minister Ehud Barak and Yoni Koren, his chief of staff, according to GCHQ documents.

Targets: Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, left, and former defence minster Ehud Barak, right, were both allegedly targeted by GCHQ and the NSA while in office in 2009

The collection of documents, seen by the Guardian, New York Times and German magazine Der Spiegel, says that the account associated with Mr Olmert was targeted in January 2009, with attempts made on email between Mr Barak and Mr Koren the following month.

Two Israeli embassies also appeared on a list of intelligence-gathering targets.

Speaking to the New York Times today, Mr Olmert explained that the address was used for correspondence with his office. But he said the information on the account was unlikely to have contained any state secrets, as sensitive matters were discussed more privately.

He said: 'This was an unimpressive target. 'I would be surprised if there was any attempt by American intelligence in Israel to listen to the prime minister’s [telehpone] lines.'

Mr Barak declined to comment on the latest information, but has previously said he took it for granted that he was under surveillance.

Other international organisations were also revealed as being on the joint target list, which the NSA and GCHQ used between 2008 and 2011.

They include senior EU officials, charitable arms of the United Nations and Médecines du Monde, a French organisation which sends doctors to war zones.

Targets: The Israeli politicians, along with other significant figures, appeared on a list for targets made by GCHQ, the headquarters of which are pictured

Joaquín Almunia, the Spanish vice-president of the European commission, who has power over competition policy, was among the names on the list.

Today a spokesman for the commission said that being targeted by spy agencies is 'unacceptable' and deserves 'our strongest condemnation'.

They said: 'This is not the type of behaviour that we expect from strategic partners, let alone from our own member states.'

The UK executive director of Médecins du Monde, Leigh Daynes, said: 'Our doctors, nurses and midwives are not a threat to national security. There is absolutely no reason for our operations to be secretly monitored.'

Leaks: The new information comes from documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who was a contractor with the National Security Agency

The documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who was formerly a contractor with the NSA, has prompted condemnation around the world by showing how the huge intelligence agencies gather their information.

Mr Snowden fled the USA before the cache of documents he leaked came to light, and is now living in Russia, which has granted him asylum.

Previously released documents have suggested that the agencies have spied on friendly powers at international conferences, including German chancellor Angela Merkel.

GCHQ said that it does not comment on intelligence matters.
