David Lawson, 63, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, pleaded guilty to two counts of harassment

A neighbour from hell who told a funeral director that his neighbour's wife had died when she was still alive has pleaded guilty to a campaign of harassment.

Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court heard that the couple were left distressed after they were visited by the Co-operative Funeral Care  following the call from David Lawson.

It was said that Lawson, 63, of Newton Aycliffe, made the call after the woman’s husband was due to give evidence against him in court.

Chris Bunting said: 'Lawson had gone 
online and told them that funeral arrangements were needed. It caused 
distress and it upset (the victim).'

Mr
Bunting added that a few weeks earlier Lawson had driven into Kirkham 
Close as (the victim) crossed the road in a manner which made her 
worried he might hit her.'

Nick Woodhouse, defending, said Lawson had tried to cancel the funeral directors, but he was too late to prevent the visit.

It was also said Lawson, who pleaded guilty to two counts of harassment, targeted another neighbour after an agreement over a lawnmower turned sour.

Chris Bunting, prosecuting, said: 'At one time Lawson and (the victim) were close friends.

They agreed to split the cost of a lawnmower that each of them would use.

Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court heard how Lawson targeted a neighbour after a row over a lawnmower

'The relationship soured to a point where there was little communication between them.

'Then a text message was sent by Lawson calling, without any foundation, (the victim) a pervert and a paedophile.

'Lawson was also seen tipping a bucket of cold water onto (the victim’s) drive in December so it would make a slippery patch and a hazard.

'He then sang a rude version of the song Long-Haired Lover from Liverpool which was offensive to (the victim).

The magistrates adjourned the case until Monday, September 30, so that a pre-sentence report could be prepared.
