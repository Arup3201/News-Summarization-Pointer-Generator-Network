Chelsea striker Diego Costa turned 26 on Tuesday, and he celebrated his big day by scoring an impressive goal in Spain training.

The European champions travel to Slovakia for a 2016 qualifier on Thursday, and stepped up their preparations during a training session in Madrid on Tuesday.

Costa is in remarkable form for Chelsea at present, but is yet to score an international goal for Spain after switching allegiances from Brazil earlier this year.

After nine goals in his first seven Premier League appearances, Costa has proven his scoring abilities, and now his first Spanish strike is surely just around the corner.

Collecting a lofted pass from Jordi Alba, the striker tricks goalkeeper Iker Casillas with ease. His feint sends Casillas sprawling to the ground, and the striker then has a route to goal.

Casillas, back on his feet, chases the Chelsea man, but Costa outpaces him and has an easy tap into the back of the net.

It's a sight Premier League crowds have become used to seeing.
