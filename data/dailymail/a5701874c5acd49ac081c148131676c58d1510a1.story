The chimes of Greensleeves from an ice cream van could soon be a summer treat of the past.

Ice cream vans could be wiped out after Sheffield City Council approved an emissions-reducing plan to force vendors to buy a new van - which cost £60,000 - every five years.

Ice cream traders say that the green scheme could mean 90 per cent of vans would now be considered 'too old,' adding an expense that would force many out of business.

Sheffield City Council’s plan ‘to reduce emissions and improve vehicle standards’ has angered many who say the scheme will hurt small businesses.

To become a thing of the past? Ice cream vans could be wiped out after a city council approved an emission-reducing scheme to force vendors to replace their van every five years, which cost £60,000 brand new

Rosita Hunt from Sheffield’s oldest ice cream firm, 138-year-old business Granelli’s said: ‘If a vehicle is roadworthy and up to required standards I see no reason for an age restriction.

‘This change will have a big impact. Replacing vehicles is not cheap and it might send some firms to the wall.

‘We haven’t received a proper explanation for why it is even necessary. If a vehicle is suitable, why change it?”

Another ice cream seller, who did not
want to named, said: ‘There is a riot going off between ice cream 
companies and the council.

‘The council must have brain freeze to keep coming up with more stupid rules and regulations.

‘Around 90 per cent of the ice cream 
vans on the road in Sheffield are over five-years-old and it costs 
thousands of pounds to replace each one.

‘It will drive firms out just as the spring and summer season is getting going.’

Even
Deputy Prime Minister and Hallam MP Nick Clegg weighed into the debate.
He said: ‘Labour are going to have cold war on their hands this summer 
if they go ahead with plans to take ice cream vans off Sheffield’s 
streets.

‘While I would 
support efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, this should be done 
in a sensible way that doesn’t wipe out small firms.’

The five-year-ban is the latest in a list of restrictions to the much-loved ice cream vans. 

Ice cream van vendors must already ask permission from headteachers to sell ice cream within 1640ft of schools, even in the evenings, holidays and at weekends, and cannot trade from one hour before until one hour after lessons.

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also hit out at the proposals.

Andrew Flower, South Yorkshire FSB branch chairman, said: ‘This ban is the most absurd and irrational decision to emanate from the Town Hall for some time.

‘It discriminates massively against one particular sector of free enterprise, setting the bar much higher for ice cream sellers than for people in any other trade or profession.

‘Their day-to-day use on local rounds and the fact they only work eight months of the year means their mileage is generally minimal with little engine wear.

‘It is not unusual for a van to last 20 or more years and still remain serviceable.’

Chris Turner, 60, who set up his business 40 years and has six vehicles said: ‘I have been to renew the annual licences for the vehicles that cost £235 per vehicle. I could only re-licence one because the others are more than five-years-old.

‘You can’t buy new vans overnight, they are specially made and there is a waiting list. I can only say that if this plan goes ahead it won’t stop me working.’

Sheffield Council said it will now review the policy before it comes into force.

The council received no responses from traders about the age restriction on vehicles before the decision was made but ice cream sellers argue the new rule was ‘hidden in the small print’.

A Sheffield Council spokeswoman said: ‘The licensing committee approved a new policy and as part of this agreed ice cream vehicles must be under five years of age. It is part of the commitment to reduce emissions city-wide.

‘We have now reopened the consultation on this policy as we have since been contacted by traders.’
