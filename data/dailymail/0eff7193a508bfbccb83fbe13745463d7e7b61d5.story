The Hubble Space Telescope has captured vivid images of the spiral galaxy Messier 77, one of the most famous and well-studied galaxies in the sky. 

Messier 77 is a galaxy in the 
constellation of Cetus, some 45 million light-years away from us. Also 
known as NGC 1068, it is one of the most famous and well-studied 
galaxies.

The stunning image of a galaxy more than 45 million light-years away, shows a swirling mass of energy, with bright pink patches that show the formation of baby stars.

The galaxy is a favourite research subject among scientists, with more papers written about it than many other galaxies put together.Despite its current fame and striking swirling appearance, the galaxy has been a victim of mistaken identity a couple of times.

When it was first discovered in 1780, the distinction between gas clouds and galaxies was not known, causing its finder Pierre Mechain to label it as a nebula.There have been further misinterpretation, and it has also been incorrectly classified as a star cluster.

Now, however, it is firmly categorised as a barred spiral galaxy, with loosely wound arms and a relatively small central bulge. It is the closest and brightest example of a particular class of galaxies known as Seyfert galaxies - galaxies that are full of hot, highly ionised gas that glow brightly, emitting intense radiation.Strong radiation like this is known to come from the heart of Messier 77 - caused by a very active black hole that is around 15 million times the mass of our Sun. Material is dragged towards this black hole and circles around it, heating up and glowing strongly.

This specific region of a galaxy, although comparatively small, can be tens of thousands of times brighter than a typical galaxy.

From the image, we can see that Messier 77's spiral arms are very bright regions. Dotted along each arm are knotty red clumps -- a signal that new stars are forming. These baby stars shine strongly, ionising nearby gas which then glows at a deeper red shade.The dust lanes stretching across this image appear as a rusty, brown-red colour due to a phenomenon known as reddening; the dust absorbs more blue light than red light, enhancing its apparent redness.

The Hubble Space Telescope has made some of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of astronomy. From its vantage point 600 km above the Earth, Hubble can detect light with 'eyes' five times sharper than the best ground-based telescopes.The telescope was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 and remains in operation. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images with almost no background light. It has revealed some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe.Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. When finally launched in 1990, scientists found that Hubble’s main mirror had been ground incorrectly, compromising the telescope's capabilities. The telescope was restored to its intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993.Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts.
