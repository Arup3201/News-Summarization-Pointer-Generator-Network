With its mustard yellow tassel detailing and textured orange top, the European President's unique piece of head-ware is more lamp shade than fashion statement.

The strange hat, which sits comically a-top Herman Van Rompuy's head, also matches a rather garish yellow satin cape, draped around the bureaucrat's shoulders.

Thankfully the 66-year-old was not wearing the snazzy outfit for fun - but instead to collect an honorary doctorate.

In vogue? President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, wears a very odd hat as he was named honorary doctor by CEU San Pablo University

Van Rompuy wore the odd attire to deliver a speech after he was named honorary doctor by CEU San Pablo University today.

Soon after his speech, Van Rompuy embraced the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy at the ceremony in Madrid, Spain.

His doctorate comes just days after he was named as the next recipient of the Charlemagne prize for work in the service of European unity.

Previous winners, which is awarded by the city of Aachen, include Winston Churchill former US president Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.

The EU's president attended the memorial service of the former South African President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday.

He was joined by a huge list of foreign dignitaries at the service including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and US President Barack Obama, both of whom paid tribute to the leader.

Scores of celebrities were also in attendance, including South African actress Charlize Theron and chat-show host Oprah Winfrey.

David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband were also at the service, with the Prime Minister sparking controversy after he posed for a 'selfie' with the US president and Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt.
