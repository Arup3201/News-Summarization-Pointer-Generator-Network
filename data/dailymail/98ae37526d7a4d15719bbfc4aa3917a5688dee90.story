A bear ate the corpse of a convicted murderer in a wooded area of Canada, according to authorities.

The mauled body of Rory Wagner, 53, was found in a rural area in southern British Columbia, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.

Police believe Wagner was already dead in a 1986 Volkswagen Jetta when the black bear broke into the vehicle, ate some parts of him and dragged the rest of the body away, reported CNN.

'The driverâ€™s window of the vehicle was down and investigators noted numerous muddy animal prints and scratches on the car,' police said.

They added that officials 'discovered the body in the surrounding bush, about 120 meters from the vehicle'.

Drug paraphernalia and a bottle of alcohol was found in the car.

A coroner is conducting an autopsy and toxicology tests.

Wagner and two other people were charged with the 1993 killing of a man they thought had sexually assaulted a relative.

The man they killed was found not guilty of sexual assault charges, according to the affiliate.

Wagner was convicted for the murder, but he had been out on parole.

Conservation officials say the bear was caught, but may be killed to ensure public safety.
