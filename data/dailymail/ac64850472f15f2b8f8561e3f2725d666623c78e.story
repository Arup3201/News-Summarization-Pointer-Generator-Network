Here's something for Ronny Deila to ponder during his Celtic’s week-long training camp in Gran Canaria.

If his side are to go and win this season’s title with the expected degrees of comfort and entertainment, can he really do without Kris Commons?

The 31-year-old made his first league start since November and injected a different dimension of invention compared to the recent toils of the Parkhead outfit.

He endured an extraordinary level of misfortune when it came to actually putting the ball in the net – twice striking the woodwork and seeing numerous other efforts blocked – but was unquestionably the driving force behind a collective performance far more convincing than the relatively slender scoreline suggests.

Goals from Emilio Izaguirre and Stefan Scepovic eventually sealed a victory that pulled Celtic back within a point of leaders Aberdeen - with a game in hand - as they prepare for what now appears an ill-timed mid-campaign break. 

The Dons could well be four in front again by the time the champions return from the Canary Islands, having used SPFL dispensation to postpone this weekend’s meeting with St Johnstone.

Whether Commons’ future will be any clearer by that point remains to be seen. With his contract due to expire in the summer, talks over an extension have stalled on the length and structure of the deal. 

Neil Lennon’s Bolton Wanderers are among the club’s circling. Here, though, was strong evidence that he still has so much to offer. Replacing him would be a mightily difficult challenge.

When it comes to sculpting something out of nothing, to providing a sudden injection of adrenaline for supporters, Celtic have no-one to compare.

His meagre level of deployment by Deila this season remains baffling. True, he isn’t the kind of supreme athlete who can always press with the intensity the Norwegian wants. But the positives he harbours surely outweigh any negatives.

Kilmarnock would certainly he happy to see the back of him. This was an evening of regular discomfort for Allan Johnston’s side, who can only feel thankful not to have conceded more.

They remain seventh, two points adrift of St Johnstone as they attempt to claim a top-half finish.

There was an unfamiliar air to the Celtic line-up selected to take to the artificial surface – a pitch they had been denied access to train on in the build-up to the match. In the end, though, much of this match bore the look of a run-of-the-mill session.

Youngster Liam Henderson was included, while Deila demoted John Guidetti to the bench after previously turning psychologist in an attempt to nurse the previously prolific Swede through a five-game goalless streak.

That decision meant a third Premiership start for Serbian striker Scepovic, still seeking to convince in the wake of his summer £2.3 million switch from Sporting Gijon.

There was also a slot for Commons - last in an opening selection for the Europa League dead rubber against Dinamo Zagreb - in what may or may not prove to be his final appearance for the Parkhead club given the transfer window is now open.

Perhaps, though, this was Deila considering horses for courses. Commons netted a hat-trick here for Celtic last March.

Kilmarnock looked well aware of his threat as he was dumped to the sodden surface inside 30 seconds following a collision with Lee Ascroft. A follow-up from Jamie Hamill a couple of minutes later had Deila waving his arms in protest.

Commons would indulge in a spot of retribution later in the half with a late challenge on Hamill that earned a yellow card from Kevin Clancy.

Yet it was his creative talents that truly caught the eye in a first half Celtic utterly dominated. He looked entirely like a man with a point to prove. In fact, the only surprise came when he wasn’t actually involved in the opening goal that finally arrived nine minutes before the break.

It was still a thing to admire. Izaguirre bolted down the left flank, got the ball back via Stefan Johansen and finished beautifully off the outside of his boot. Not bad at all.

The strike was a reward for almost constant pressure. Johansen was the first to threaten when played through but seemed to be waiting for a written invitation. Mark Connolly nipped in to intercept before incurring a booking for angrily disputing the resulting corner.

Henderson had a shot bravely blocked by Ross Barbour before Commons took over.

A snapshot from 25 yards struck the junction of post and bar. Another effort was dragged wide after set-up play from Johansen and Scepovic.

Quick feet then shifted him away from Lee Ashcroft to fire narrowly over, before clipping the bar again following a fluid move that featured Henderson, Nir Bitton and Adam Matthews.

There was still time for one more ahead of the interval, when he took a pass from Henderson to thrash in an effort that was beaten out by Craig Samson. Commons must have spent the break wondering quite how his name hadn’t entered the scoresheet.

The sound of sombre reflection surely filled Kilmarnock’s dressing room. Johnston had started with Alexei Eremenko behind Josh Magennis and two wingers. It was bold but painfully open.

The only test they offered Craig Gordon was a Magennis header from an Eremenko free-kick that the Celtic goalkeeper safely clutched down low. It seemed, therefore, to be a tactical decision when Johnston replaced his namesake Chris with Robbie Muirhead after 34 minutes.

A rasping low drive from Jamie Hamill that zipped just beyond Gordon’s right-hand post gave the home fans a flicker of excitement as the second half got underway.

Commons, however, was soon back in the saddle. A scalpel-like through-ball found Henderson, who should have done better than an attempt that was neither a cross nor a shot. 

The former Derby man then turned neatly inside the area, but his power-packed drive was deflected too high for another corner.

While the single-goal margin somehow remained in place, there were always going to be nervy moments for Celtic. Muirhead supplied one via a dipping effort that was expertly tipped away by Gordon.

That anxiety was finally dispelled with 19 minutes remaining. Johansen delivered a corner that Ambrose headed on, with Scepovic claiming the final touch.
