Ma'Lik Richmond has returned to the Steubenville Big Red football roster a little more than a year

Ma'Lik Richmond has returned to the Steubenville Big Red football roster a little more than a year after being found delinquent of raping a 16-year-old girl

after being found delinquent of raping a 16-year-old girl.

Richmond was one of two teens convicted in the case that made national headlines and sparked intense discussion over the privilege of student athletes.

He was convicted in March 2013 and released from the Ohio Juvenile Detention Center on January 6, 2014.

The 7th District Court of Appeals upheld his sexual offender classification in June.

Writer Alexandria Goddard, who is widely
 acknowledged as having brought the case to national attention by 
reporting on social media, told Buzzfeed Richmond's return to the team was to be expected.

'I wanted to be shocked, but I think we all knew it was bound to happen,' she wrote. 

'Steubenville City Schools hasn’t really done a lot in the past two 
years to prove to the world that they don’t tolerate rape culture and 
allowing a Tier II registered sex offender on the team pretty much 
solidifies the assumption that they are concerned about wins rather than
 the safety of young girls or the destruction of rape culture in their 
area,' she added.

The
 case stretches back almost two years to an August 2012 incident in 
which the then-16-year-old victim was raped during a football party.

The
 girl was dragged from one party while too drunk to respond, stripped 
naked, abused, digitally penetrated, and photographed while face down on
 the basement floor.

Texts
 and tweets shared between the attackers and their friends humiliated 
the victim as they joked about details of the attack online.

Richmond and player Trent Mays were tried as 
juveniles and though both were classified as Tier II sex offenders, the state’s second highest category.

Mays was sentenced to two years 
detention and Richmond to just one year.

Neither Steubenville's athletic director or coaches have responded to interview requests regarding Richmond's return

Images of the victim being assaulted were shared on social media, humiliating her a second time

Mays will be released in 2015 with good behavior.

The case drew a firestorm of controversy to the small Ohio town, especially after the family of Cody Saltsman, a 
player who had partied earlier with the group and posted the picture and
 derogatory comments on Twitter, tried to silence her with a defamation 
suit.

Eventually the case attracted the attention of online activist group Anonymous to both the assault and allegations to cover up the crime, who then began a movement for justice to be served.

Richmond must continue registering as a Tier II sex offender every 180 days for the next 20 years

The unidentified victim has not spoken publicly about the case but has reportedly discussed a film based on her assault with Brad Pitt's production company

Upon being released from detention, his attorney described Richmond as 'a better, stronger person' who 'looks forward to school, life, 
and spending time with family.'

An attorney for the unidentified victim called the statement, which did not acknowledge his client, 'disheartening.'

WTRF, which first broke news of Richmond's return, notes that he must continue registering as a Tier II sex offender every 180 days for the next 20 years.

Trent Mays (L) and Ma'lik Richmond (R) attracted the attention of online group Anonymous after pictures and details about the crime were found to be shared on social media

Neither Steubenville's athletic director or coaches have responded to interview requests.

Richmond's return is the latest twist the case's history, as it was revealed in April that the teenage victim of the 
Steubenville rape wants to work with Brad Pitt on his movie of the now 
notorious Ohio scandal.

The
 girl, who has never spoken publicly about her ordeal at the hands of 
High School football stars, Ma’lik Richmond and Trent Mays, has asked 
for ‘input’ into the movie which will chronicle the crime and the role 
played by Anonymous hacker, Deric Lotstutter in exposing it and the 
cover up that followed.

Upon being released from detention, his attorney described Richmond as 'a better, stronger person' who 'looks forward to school, life, and spending time with family'

In April, the victim’s attorney, Bob Fitzsimmons, said: ‘As time goes on it’s easier and better for her.

‘She’s
 still in high school and she’ll be graduating in May. She’s been 
accepted to college and she intends to go. She still receives a lot of 
support from friends and family and from time to time she still receives
 professional counselling.

‘Overall she’s made a good recovery.’

However he would not comment directly on the victim's feelings about Richmond returning to Steubenville, saying only: 'When somebody’s been a victim and the perpetrator returns to
 the community it creates issues and a situation that I’m sure has to be
 dealt with.’
