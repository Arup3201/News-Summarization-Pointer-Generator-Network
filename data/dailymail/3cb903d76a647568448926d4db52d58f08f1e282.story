Chelsea centre backs John Terry and Gary Cahill posed on the team bus as the squad traveled to face Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday evening.

Jose Mourinho’s side have to immediately respond to the disappointment of Robin van Persie’s late equaliser at Old Trafford on Sunday, as the Premier League leaders head to Greenhous Meadow.

The League Two side are the lowest-ranked team left in the League Cup this season.

Terry posted on Instagram a picture alongside team-mate and fellow centre back Cahill with the caption: ‘Bus Journey to Shrewsbury with the BIG man for tomorrow's game. Watching Homeland Season 4. #Cahill #capitalcup #2hourstogo’.

In Terry's post Chelsea full back Filipe Luis looks engrossed in sending a text message as the rest of the Blues squad relaxed ahead of the fourth-round tie.

Jose Mourinho is likely to make plenty of changes to his starting line-up that drew at Manchester United but will still be without striker Diego Costa who trained on Monday but won't be fit in time.

Defenders Cesar Azpilicueta and Branislav Ivanovic are both suspended but Brazilian midfielder Ramires could feature following five weeks out with a groin problem.

Following the draw at Old Trafford on Sunday, Terry had claimed he and Ivanovic were 'double headlocked' from every corner during the match.

TV pictures clearly showed the United defenders grabbing their Chelsea counterparts around the neck but referee Phil Dowd failed to spot the offences which prompted Terry to post on Instagram on Monday: '#JTandIVAgotdoubleheadlockedfromeverycorner'.
