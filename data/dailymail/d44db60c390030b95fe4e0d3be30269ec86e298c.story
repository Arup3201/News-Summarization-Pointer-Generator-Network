Fallen on his feet: Gavin Grant, the 'fatcat' boss of the RSPCA, who is being paid as much as £160,000 by the animal welfare charity

The new ‘fat cat’ boss of the RSPCA is being paid up to 45 per cent more than his predecessor, figures revealed yesterday.

Gavin Grant was accused of ‘brazen greed’ at a time when the animal charity’s income from donations is falling.

Figures also showed the RSPCA is spending less on animal welfare, but more on prosecuting people for alleged cruelty.

Mr Grant, a former public relations executive and lifelong Liberal Democrat who is credited with helping Nick Clegg become party leader, began as RSPCA chief executive in January 2012.

At the time, the charity refused to disclose his pay package, but yesterday its annual report revealed the figure to be between £150,000 and £160,000. The RSPCA still would not state his exact earnings.

His predecessor, Mark Watts, earned £110,000 to £120,000, meaning Mr Grant is raking in between £30,000 and £50,000 more – a rise of between 25 per cent and 45 per cent.

Two other unidentified bosses are earning up to £150,000 and £130,000. This is believed to be the first time pay has risen above £120,000 at the RSPCA.

Anne Kasica, a campaigner who runs the Self-Help Group, an organisation for animal owners ‘experiencing difficulties with the RSPCA’, said: ‘Even we were taken aback by the brazen greed which this represents.

‘Whoever all these highly-paid executives are, this is outrageous. Donations intended to help lost, sick and suffering animals have been, and are being, used to pay at least three people vastly more than last year.’

Fellow campaigner Ernest Vine said: ‘The dwindling number of people who still do without, in order to put money in RSPCA collecting tins, will be horrified at the way their sacrifices are being used.’

Figures in the RSPCA’s annual accounts also reveal that income from donations was down from £45million in 2011 to £44million in 2012; spending on animal welfare was down from £38million to £37million; and financial support given to RSPCA branches was down from £8.8million to £8.2million.

But the money spent by the RSPCA on prosecutions rose from £8.7million in 2011 to £11.2million in 2012.

Last year the charity was criticised by a judge after spending a ‘staggering’ £326,000 on a magistrates’ court prosecution against David Cameron’s local hunt in Oxfordshire.

The Heythrop Hunt became the first to be convicted of illegally killing foxes. It was fined £4,000 after admitting four offences under laws introduced in 2005, but the case was branded politically-motivated by the hunt’s supporters.

Last night the RSPCA said: ‘The RSPCA is one of the oldest and largest animal charities in the country and is responsible for the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of hundreds of thousands of animals a year.

‘We openly publish our accounts online every year. The figures displayed in this year’s accounts on individual emoluments reflect restructuring costs incurred during 2012, rather than current directors’ salaries.

‘Like many organisations we do not comment on individual salaries. That said our chief executive’s salary is subject to regular independent review and is within the parameters of the going rate for major UK charities, both animal welfare and other.’
