Anger: Nigel Evans has called for the Crown Prosecution Service to repay his legal expenses

MPs today called for an investigation into high-profile prosecutions of celebrities in the wake of the acquittal of Nigel Evans, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.  

Keith Vaz asked the regulator of the Crown Prosecution Service to probe whether there was really enough evidence to charge Mr Evans and other well-known figures who have been on trial recently.  

Coronation Street stars Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell were both cleared of sexual assault charges after long-running trials, leading to accusations that the CPS is over-zealous in prosecuting famous people.  

Mr Evans, the MP for Ribble Valley, today vowed to use his position to fight for others caught up in the legal system and then acquitted.  

He has asked Mr Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, to consider whether defendants should be given more protection before and during trials.  

The select committee boss has written to Michael Fuller, the CPS's chief inspector, urging him to examine whether the prosecutor's procedures are 'sufficiently robust'.  

Mr Vaz asked Mr Fuller asked him to look into whether the CPS had followed due process in deciding whether to bring prosecutions, whether there was sufficient evidence to bring charges, and whether the procedures in such cases needed to be amended.  

'Politicians should not become involved in the operational decision-making of the CPS. It is vital, however, that the processes followed by the CPS are correct and robust,' Mr Vaz said.  

'Nigel Evans has asked that the committee look at this issue and I have written to Mr Fuller to request he investigate whether we need to make changes to the system. We await his response with interest. 

'The balance must be struck so that the public remains fully confident that those who are guilty will be brought to justice, but also that those who are innocent are not unnecessarily punished.'  

Earlier today, Mr Evans suggested that the CPS had become over-zealous in pursuing sex abuse claims after failing to charge Jimmy Savile with paedophilia.  

'The balance probably went too far in one way and now it seems to have gone too far the other way - that there is almost this we-better-charge-just-in-case - and it does seem to be unfair,' he said.

Walking free: The former Deputy Speaker has accused prosecutors of cobbling together a weak case

 Mr Evans, 56, was charged with one count of rape, five of sexual assault, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults. 

Last Thursday, a jury at Preston Crown Court unanimously cleared him of all the charges.  

He told BBC Radio 4's programme this morning that 'there were weak allegations which were bundled together to make it look as if it were a stronger case'.  

The MP continued: 'I've likened it to being hit by an Eddie Stobart truck as soon as you wake up, and several times during the day. The only worse thing I could have been accused of was murder.  

'The people who are throwing the mud remain anonymous, yet I was put into the full glare of world publicity from day one, as soon as the police knocked on the door. This is something that needs to be looked at.' 

He denied claims that there is a culture of low-level sexual abuse within Parliament, saying: 'There is a narrative that has been put out there, and people are spreading this narrative, but it's completely wrong.'

Mr Evans revealed that he would not seek to regain his position as Deputy Speaker, which he resigned last year after being charged with assault, and said he would focus on fighting for reforms to allow acquitted defendants to reclaim their legal costs.  

'I've got a voice, and there are a lot of people who've equally gone through the mill and don't have the voice that I have,' he told Today. 'People who are wrongly accused and been put through the mill, they need proper representation.  

'But at the end of it all, when they're acquitted they're told, "You're not going to get a single penny back." That has got to be wrong.' 

He told ITV's Daybreak that in light of his experiences, he opposes the cuts to legal aid made by the Coalition Government. 

'I see things through the prism of having gone through sheer hell for 11 months,' Mr Evans said. 'I believe people who are dragged through the courts, who are acquitted, should get a reasonable legal cost back.'

The MP suggested that the Crown Prosecution Service had become over-zealous in pursuing sex abuse claims after failing to charge Jimmy Savile with paedophilia. 

'The balance probably went too far in one way and now it seems to have gone too far the other way - that there is almost this we-better-charge-just-in-case - and it does seem to be unfair,' he said.  

Mr Evans said he had received more than 1,000 messages of support and he was 'heartened' by Prime Minister David Cameron's remarks after the verdict, in which he hinted that the MP will be brought back into the Tory fold.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the work of the CPS, telling a Westminster press conference it was a 'linchpin' of the legal system. 

He said: 'I'm sure the CPS as a matter of course will always review cases, particularly where they haven't succeeded to deliver prosecutions they felt were merited.  

'But I will always defend the CPS as part of the checks and balances in our judicial system.  

'We wouldn't have much of a judicial system if the CPS succeeded every time. That's what justice is about - it's about people bringing prosecutions and then those allegations and those claims being examined in court and a decision being made.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Anyone who has applied for legal aid and is subsequently acquitted of a crime is entitled to be repaid at least part of their legal costs - irrespective of whether their application was accepted.'
