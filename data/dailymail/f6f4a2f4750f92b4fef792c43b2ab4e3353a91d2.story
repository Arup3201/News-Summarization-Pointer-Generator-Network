Her father has been nicknamed Air Miles Andy.

And judging by her nine foreign jaunts since Christmas, it seems Princess Beatrice is keen to follow in his extremely well-trodden footsteps.

Despite insisting she is ‘exploring her career options’, the unemployed 26-year-old has found time to jet away for luxury ski trips, sun herself on a Caribbean yacht and party with her friends in Greece.

Her string of holidays culminated in a flight to New York earlier this week to celebrate her sister Eugenie’s 25th birthday.

Although Beatrice receives no public funding, her jet-set lifestyle is sure to attract criticism at a time when the Queen is keen to promote royal thriftiness. 

It also is likely to raise eyebrows given that she has not had a job since before Christmas.

During the New York trip Beatrice, Eugenie and their mother the Duchess of York popped up via video link before an audience at St James’s Palace. 

Her father Prince Andrew, who was carrying out a public engagement at the palace, got his guests to sing Happy Birthday. 

It was Beatrice’s third US jaunt this year alone. She had already been spotted in New York in January before hitting the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, the following month.

At the time palace aides said she was in the US preparing to embark on a finance course. But sources said the course lasted ‘barely a matter of days’. 

By early this month it was time for another holiday – a long weekend with friends in Greece.

Beatrice’s ‘job hunt’ began after she quit a £19,500-a-year post at Sony Entertainment Pictures amid claims she was targeted by a North Korean cyber-attack on the firm. 

She has since soaked up the sun with boyfriend Dave Clark on two trips to Caribbean island St Barts, at one point staying on tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s yacht.

She also squeezed in three trips to her parents’ £13million chalet in Verbier, Switzerland. 

Buckingham Palace said she was ‘continuing to pursue a career in the business sector’. A source said the US course was ‘always going to be a short-term thing’.
