Peter Lanza, the father of Sandy Hook shooter, hadn't spoken to his son for more than two years and his father is at a loss for what drove Adam to kill 20 students and six teachers at his old elementary school.

A family friend told The Wall Street Journal that father Peter Lanza 'is as clueless as everybody' as to what cause the boy to snap.

Adam, 20, had not spoken to his brother Ryan or father for upwards of two years at the time of the shooting. Adam reportedly distanced himself from his father Peter when he started to become serious with his new girlfriend, and current wife.

Peter and Adam's mother Nancy split in 2001 but did not formally divorce until November 2008. Court records made the split appear amicable as both parties agreed to put their sons needs above any bitterness, but Adam was apparently the one to cut ties with his father in 2010.

New life: Peter Lanza stopped visiting his son Adam in 2010 when he began living in this Stamford house

For the first nine years following the split, Peter visited Adam and Ryan at their mother's home in Newtown from his new house in Stamford, 45 minutes away. 

The Wall Street Journal reports that Adam cut ties from his father in 2010, right about the time that Peter began living with Shelley Cudiner.

Peter has been living with Cudiner in Stamford for about three years and they married last year.

News of the inner-workings of the Lanza 
family comes on the same day that they released a statement saying that a
 hoaxer pretended to be Ryan Lanza, Adam's 24-year-old brother and 
conducted an interview with The New York Post.

The Post conducted the interview over
 Facebook chat with an account claiming to be the brother of the dead 
shooter. A number of quotes given to the paper included grammatical 
mistakes and spelling errors.

In the chat, the hoaxer said that 'I am a victim...I loss [sic] my mom and brother.'

The
 so-called Ryan Lanza posted two photos on Facebook over the weekend, 
one of his brother Adam and one of his mother Nancy- who was the first 
victim in the shooting spree- with emotional messages in the captions.

'I will miss you bro. I will always love you as long as I live,' he wrote under a picture of a then-teenaged Adam.

A
 similar sentiment went out to his mother, for whom he said 'I miss you 
mom. I love you so much. You will always be in my heart.'

Though
 this incident seemed unusual given it was the first time Ryan formally 
spoke with a reporter, it was not the first time that he took to 
Facebook to speak out about the case.

On the day of the shooting, Ryan initially posted denials of his involvement on Facebook.

Relations were not much better between 
Adam and his older brother Ryan, 24, as the paper revealed that the two 
brothers had not spoken since after Christmas in 2010.

At that time, 
Ryan moved away to Manhattan, and though that is not terribly far from 
Connecticut, the two siblings do not appear to have been concerned about
 staying in touch.

Ryan
 was initially identified as the shooter in the crazed hours immediately
 following the shooting on Friday December 14 when Adam killed his 
mother in their Connecticut home and then proceeded to kill 20 young 
children, six teachers and himself.

Because
 Adam had his brother's identification on him at the time of the 
shooting, police initially announced that it was Ryan Lanza who was the 
murderer.

In 
reality, Ryan was at work at financial firm Ernst & Young in 
Manhattan when television news reports began claiming he was the 
shooter.

Lanza quickly 
told his boss: 'I need to go.' He then walked out of his Times Square 
office, according to a co-worker who spoke to MailOnline on condition of
 anonymity.

Thirty minutes later, New York police officers stormed the office. Between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning, Lanza defended himself in a series of bizarre Facebook posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his ID was found at the scene.

'Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn't me,' he insisted on his Facebook page on Friday. 'I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me. IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN'T ME.'

Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan 
Lanza's, told the AP that he sent Ryan a Facebook message Friday asking 
what was going on and if he was alright.

According to Wilshe, Lanza's reply was something along the lines of: 'It was my brother. I think my mother is dead. Oh my God.'

The
 relationship between Ryan and his brother is one that will undoubtedly 
come to light as time goes on, but part of the reason why Ryan was ruled
 out as a suspect in the shooting was because he has not seen his 
brother in over two years.

Real words: Immediately after the shooting, MailOnline took a screengrab (pictured above) of Ryan Lanza's Facebook account where he spoke out saying that he had no connection to the actual shooting

Love: The hoaxer claiming to be Ryan said that he loved his mother Nancy, right, who was the first victim of the shooting and was killed in bed at her Newtown home, left

That absence does not seem to have made him any less loyal, however, as he now takes to Facebook to criticize those who criticize his dead brother.

For instance, when someone wrote on Ryan's pace that his brother deserved to 'rot in hell' and was the 'scum of the earth', Ryan responded by writing 'I am so tired of people blaming me or something my brother did. I love Adam, hes [sic] my brother.'

Ryan continued, saying that the person who commented was a stranger: 'He is calling my brother a monster when he don't [sic] even know him'.
