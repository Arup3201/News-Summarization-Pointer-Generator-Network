Jose Mourinho has taken a dig at Manchester City after their £25million signing of Wilfried Bony. 

The Premier League champions wrapped up a four-and-half year deal worth £100,000-a-week for the Ivorian striker on Wednesday but Mourinho has questioned whether City have remained within Financial Fair Play rules.

He said: 'Good striker. If they have the money and no problems with FFP, well done. Rules are different for City.'

City's signing of Bony means they now boast four  of the Barclays Premier League’s top five goalscorers of 2014 - Bony, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko.

Manuel Pellegrini's side are two points behind Chelsea in the title race, but Mourinho believes his side are not favourtes. 

He said: 'We are not favourites for the title, we are candidates. I would say the same if we were two points behind.'

Chelsea travel to Swansea on Saturday but Mourinho is still expecting a difficult test from Gary Monk's side despite the loss of Bony. 

He said: 'Swansea have a very good team and very good teams don't depend on one player. Losing Bony doesn't make them less difficult.'

Mourinho also refused to deny whether he called referee Phil Dowd fat after Chelsea's 5-3 defeat to Tottenham earlier in the month. 

Mourinho was alleged to have said: ‘You’re too fat to referee, you should retire.’ Mourinho is also said to have shouted. ‘You’ve cost us.’

But when asked about the incident on Friday, he said: 'He made a big mistake. But when I got to his room, I go in a privileged position having watched it on TV.'
