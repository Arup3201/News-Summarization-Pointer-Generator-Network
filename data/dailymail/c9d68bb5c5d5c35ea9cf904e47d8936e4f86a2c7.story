Quit: Lollipop man Bob Slade, pictured today outside his house in 
Plymouth, Devon, left his post after council bosses threatened him with a
 suspension

A lollipop man has quit his post after he was threatened with suspension for high-fiving school children by council bosses.

Bob Slade, 65, had been a crossing patrol supervisor outside the Manadon Vale primary school in Plymouth, Devon, for four-and-a-half years.

But the former dockyard worker resigned after Plymouth City Council said he would be suspended for four weeks for high-fiving children - which they said was a safety concern.

Mr Slade said: 'I really enjoyed the job. I have been doing it for more than four years without a single accident.

'I had to stop giving them high fives about a month before I resigned.

'The parents were all happy for me to do so and I would always ensure their safety but once the council told me I would be suspended, I thought it was best I resigned.

"They told me to be very friendly with the children when I first got the job, which I did.'

The school is currently without a crossing patrol supervisor following Mr Slade’s departure.

Parents of children at the school have backed Mr Slade and slammed the 'ridiculous' council decision.

Mother of two Barbara Laws said: 'He is a 
lovely man who is there in rain or shine. He knows all the kids and they
 love him.

'Ridiculous': Plymouth City Council said Mr Slade's friendly gesture of high-fiving children as they crossed the road was a safety risk

'I cannot believe it, it is so ridiculous for something so 
innocent. It isn’t dangerous.

'It was just meant as a kindness to the children, it is just common sense out of the window.'

Others posted their support on the internet.

Jennie Wills posted: 'How ridiculous !!!! Our Lollypop Man is lovely all the kids love him.'

Paddy Paddison posted: 'PCC once again showing that rigid adherence to rules is more important than people. 

'So well done to the council employee who
 has put a number of children in danger for the sake of making sure that
 the crossing guard didn't have any human contact while performing his 
job. Pathetic.'

Helen Delamer posted: 'A lollipop person 
needs to have a good rapport with the kids so they ALWAYS cross with 
him/her. Plymouth Councillers need to each, in turn, try doing that job 
themselves before coming out with this nonsense.'

Ann-Marie Ballard posted: 'Omg he was actually interacting with the kids which encourages them to cross with him.'

Michelle Garrett-Martin posted: 'Has anyone actually asked for or pulled together stats on how many accidents have happened under his watch?

'Probably not because there haven't been any. Ridiculous - if you listen to the mum on the radio he is doing what PCC say he should do, with his arm out - the kids are 'high-fiving' him. World gone mad.'

Mr Slade said he appreciates the support from parents, but would be unlikely to return to the role.

Speaking today, he said: 'It's nice to hear all the parents have been supportive, but I've resigned now and I believe they'll be getting someone to replace me fairly soon.'

Mr Slade is not the only lollipop man to receive disciplinary action for high-fiving schoolchildren.

In July, Roger Green, 64, was told that he could no longer greet pupils from Sandy Lane Primary School in Bracknell, 
Berkshire, with the gesture.

He was asked to stop because a driver said it slowed down 
traffic.

Hundreds of parents reacted angrily to the ban by Bracknell Forest Council - who said the greeting put Mr Green and the children 'at risk'.

Mr
 Green, who worked as lollipop man for three years, said: 'I put a sign 
up for couple of days saying that due to a complaint I could no longer 
high-five children.

'The parents complained as they can't understand why the ban is in place.

'I have to follow what my boss says, but it is a harmless piece of fun and all the children like it.'

A Plymouth City Council spokesman said: 'We take the safety of children very 
seriously and school crossing patrols exist to make sure children can 
cross roads as safely as possible.

'To do this they must hold out the lollipop with one arm and hold their other arm outstretched to signal that all traffic must stop, this is well established signalling that should be understood by all drivers.

'While patrols can be friendly their full attention must be on the road and they must watch the traffic closely at all times.

'The high-fives was one of a number of safety issues raised with the school crossing patrol before he made the decision to resign.

'We will be recruiting to fill the position at Manadon Vale primary school as quickly as possible.'

Mr Slade is not the first lollipop man to fall victim to high-fiving schoolchildren.

Roger Green, 64, was told that he cannot greet pupils from Sandy Lane Primary School in Bracknell, Berkshire, with the gesture because a driver said it slowed down traffic.

Hundreds of parents reacted angrily to the ban by Bracknell Forest Council, with some complaining to the school.

The council said the simple greeting put Mr Green and the children 'at risk'.

Mr Green, who worked as lollipop man for three years, said: 'I put a sign up for couple of days saying that due to a complaint I could no longer high-five children.

'The parents complained as they can't understand why the ban is in place.

'I have to follow what my boss says, but it is a harmless piece of fun and all the children like it.'
