Famed evangelist Reverend Franklin Graham went on a news program this morning likely hoping to show a strong standard for the Republican presidential candidates.

Flash forward fifteen minutes and he had questioned some combination of the moral character, authenticity, and religious beliefs of the President as well as the top three Republican hopefuls.

Starting with President Obama, Mr Graham- son of the most famous televangelist Reverend Billy Graham- said that while he does say that he is a Christian, and may go to church when the cameras are watching, there are also signs that he has Muslim leanings.

Controversial comments: Reverend Franklin Graham appeared on Morning Joe Tuesday when he waffled on President Obama's faith and said that Mormonism isn't the same as Christianity

The Reverend hedged slightly throughout, saying that while Mr Obama has told him personally that he is a Christian and Mr Graham chooses to take him at his word, he still does have some reservations about how sincere the President is about his faith.

'I think you have to ask President Obama,' Mr Graham told the hosts of MSNBC's show Morning Joe.

'He has said he’s a Christian, so I just have to assume that he is.

'You have to go by what a person says and how they live their life and where they go to church. Are they faithful church-goers? Or do they just go when the cameras are on them.'

He then claimed that Mr Obama did not regularly attend a church in Chicago until he needed to in order to be accepted by the community of voters.

These claims come on the heels of Republican candidate Rick Santorum questioning- and then readdressing the comments- President Obama's faith.

Mr Graham then projected his comments onto Mr Obama's foreign policy dealings and sensativity to Muslim issues.

'Under Islamic law–Sharia law–Islam sees him as a son of Islam. Because his father was a Muslim, his grandfather was a Muslim...That's just the way it works,' he said.

'But, of course, he says he didn’t grow up that way, he doesn’t believe in that, he believes in Jesus Christ, so I accept that.'

The famed preacher then moved on to talk about the current crop of Republican presidential candidates, and continued his controversial assessment.

When asked if Mitt Romney was a Christian, Mr Graham responded 'He is a Mormon'.

Not the same: Mr Graham said that 'most Christians would not recognize Mormonism as part of the Christian faith'

'Most Christians would not recognize Mormonism as part of the Christian faith.

'Of course, (Mormons) believe in Jesus Christ. But they believe in a lot of other things, too, that we don't accept.'

From that point on, Mr Graham focused on the positive, saying that he would approve of Mr Romney, Mr Santorum, or Mr Gingrich as the Republican nominee.

Ron Paul- who is also still in the race- was not mentioned at all during the interview.

Mr Graham credited Mr Romney with 'the strength, business-wise, politics-wise' to be a good President.

And even though Mr Gingrich has been married three times- and, as the Reverent put it, 'has those issues'- he is still 'A Christian. At least he told me he is'.

The field: Mr Graham said that he had spoken with both Mr Gingrich (left) and Mr Santorum (right) about their faith, and believed he was closest to Mr Santorum in terms of judgement on moral issues

His strongest religious endorsement, however, went to Mr Santorum, with whom he is aligned most closely with.

'I would say on moral issues, no question, Rick Santorum,' Mr Graham said.

'He's a very sharp guy as far as his Christian faith being more in line but all of them are when it comes to policy and running the country.

'You’ve got to have a person make good decisions that are best for all of us, and I think all the candidates that are running are capable men,' he said, trying to sound supportive of all three without choosing sides.

Considering the constant ebb and flow of the race, remaining neutral may be the smartest move.

On Tuesday evening, Gallup had Mr Santorum leading with 36 per cent of the Republican vote, Mr Romney in second with 26 per cent, and Mr Gingrich in third with 14 per cent.
