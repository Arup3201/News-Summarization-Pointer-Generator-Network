Workers at baking giant Warburtons orchestrated an elaborate scam to steal 60 lorry loads of bread baskets so they could recycle the plastic and pocket £500,000.

Paul Rogers, Robert Cooper and Paul Matthews plotted to take the trays from the bakery's plant in Darwen, Lancashire, where Rogers and Cooper both worked.

Rogers and Cooper then sold the trays to PM Plastics, the firm owned by Matthews, where the plastic was chipped for recycling as part of the cash-making scheme.

Paul Rogers, Robert Cooper and Paul Matthews have been jailed for their part in a £500,000 scam to steal more than 60 lorry loads of bread trays from the plant of baking giant Warburtons  in Darwen, Lancashire

The three men have now been jailed for a total of more than ten years, after being convicted at Burnley Crown Court of 
conspiracy to steal.

Warburtons delivery driver Rogers, 34, from Rochdale, and his supervisor Cooper, 61, from Bolton, were jailed for 42 and 48 months respectively. 

Matthews, 46, from Darwen, was jailed for 36 months after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

The court heard how the workers hatched the plan after Warburtons started recycling its own baskets in November 2010 and instead leased baskets from Bakers Basco, a consortium of leading bakers.

Rogers, a former soldier and a father of four, and Cooper, a grandfather, arranged to steal £560,000 worth of trays - around 230 tonnes - from the family-owned company.

Rogers then took the trays to the recycling plant, making 67 trips there between October 2011 and March 2011.

The court heard there was no legitimate reason for the trips to be made but that they had been authorised by Cooper.

The trays were then granulated at the recycling plant, where each tonne was valued at around £500.

But the plot was unraveled after Bakers Basco became suspicious.

The trays were taken from Warburtons before being sold to PM Plastics, where they were chipped for recycling

The company started to notice a major shortage of its new ‘universal basket’ in March 2012.

They sent an investigator along to PM plastics, where he saw the baskets and witnessed some being chipped for recycling.

When Matthews was arrested, police found 5,340 trays at the site along with a three-tonne bag of chipped plastics, the court was told.

Rogers and Cooper were arrested after that, but pleaded not guilty to the charges, blaming each other for the scam.

Prosecutor Nicholas Courtney said: 'Mr Rogers accepted he had delivered the baskets to Mr Cooper, but said he was merely obeying Mr Cooper who had told him to do it.

'And when police spoke to Mr Cooper, he said he did not know anything about it and blamed it on Mr Rogers.'

Bob Sastry, defending Rogers, said the plot was completely out of character.

He said: 'He was well-regarded by his colleagues and this was something which was totally out of character.

'The clang of the prison gates will ring especially loud for someone like him has never been to prison before.'

Rogers, of Parkway, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was jailed for 42 months having been earlier found guilty of one count of conspiracy to steal.

Addressing Rogers, Judge Simon Newell said: 'You were in a position of trust, perhaps to a lesser degree than Mr Cooper, but trust nevertheless.'

Cooper, 51, of Bolton, was jailed for 48 months while Matthews, 46, of Darwen received a sentence of 36 months.
