Former NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw has announced that his cancer is now in remission. 

In February the 74-year-old journalism legend said he'd been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which attacks the bone marrow.

But in a note to the NBC News staff he said the future is bright.

'A year ago my future was more uncertain than I cared to acknowledge but now I face the New Year with very encouraging news,' he said. 

He will begin a drug regimen shortly to ensure the cancer stays in remission. 

Brokaw anchored the NBC news program from 1982 to 2004, and remains a special correspondent. 

In November, he was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He is also credited with the term 'The Greatest Generation.' 

'I flew home reflecting again on how lucky we are that generation gave us the lives we have today," he wrote, NBC reports, "how my last year was a challenge but I was meeting it in world class hospitals with brilliant physicians, not in a foxhole in the Ardennes."

The note was signed off: 'Happy New Year all. T Bone.'
