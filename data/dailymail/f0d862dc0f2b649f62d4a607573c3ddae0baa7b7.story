A dying, paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak, intentionally blinked his eyes to identify a photo of his attacker for authorities, prosecutors have said in the opening statements of the suspect's murder trial.

Defese lawyers in the trial of alleged killer Ricardo Woods say blinking cannot be considered consistent, reliable evidence.

Over the next few weeks, jurors will be asked to decide whether Woods killed David Chandler, of Cincinnati.Â 

Incident: David Chandler, left, identified, 34-year-old Ricardo Woods (right), who has now been charged with murder, felonious assault and weapons counts and faces up to life in prison if convicted

Paralyzed and hooked up to a 
ventilator, David Chandler was two weeks from death when police arrived 
at his hospital room to question him about the person who shot him. They
wanted to know if he could identify a suspect, and they had a photo to 
show him.

Chandler was unable to communicate 
except with his eyes as he lay in bed attached to myriad tubes and with a
brace around his neck. His eyes opened barely more than a slit at 
times; he was instructed to blink three times for yes and twice for no. 
One detective quizzed him, and another videotaped his responses.

Chandler
didn't respond with blinks to every question in the 17-minute video, 
and there were solo blinks. But triple blinks came in response to 
repeated questions asking if he knew the shooter and whether the person 
in the photo was the culprit.

Legal experts say such cases - while not unheard of - are unusual, and dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or differing interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases around the country that have ended in convictions.

Police
asked Chandler to blink three times for yes and twice for no to a 
series of questions in the interview, said Assistant Hamilton County 
Prosecutor David Prem.

Chandler also blinked yes to indicate
that he knew the gunman and that his name began with the letter O, Prem
said. O was a street name that Woods sometimes used, the prosecutor 
said.

Prem told jurors that when they view the video, they will clearly see that Chandler knew what he was doing.

'You are going to see how he was struggling to get it right,' Prem said.

The motive for the shooting, the prosecutor said, was that Chandler owed Woods money for drugs.

Chandler was a drug user who had 
bought drugs many times from Woods but had gone to an area near Woods' 
home the night of the shooting with two friends to buy drugs from 
someone else.

Chandler was shot about 20 yards from Woods' home and in an area known for drug deals, he said.

Familiar: Woods reportedly knew the victim through drug deals

Prem said that while neither of the 
men in the car with Chandler could clearly identify the man who shot 
him, one heard a voice yelling Chandler's name.

Defense attorney Wendy Calaway 
insisted that Woods did not shoot Chandler and is 'an innocent man who 
found himself in a perfect storm of misinformation and 
misidentification'. Calaway said Chandler had stolen drugs from dealers 
previously.

'He had many enemies,' Calaway said of Chandler.

He had received threats and was 
considered a 'snitch' who informed on drug dealers to police, according 
to Calaway. Police decided before their investigation was completed that
Woods was the shooter and never followed up on any other leads, Calaway
said.

Calaway also focused on the blinking 
identification, saying that while doctors were able to establish a 'rudimentary' communication system with Chandler, 'his blinks were 
inconsistent and sporadic'.

Law: Judge Beth Myers of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ruled at an earlier hearing that jurors could see the videotape, saying she found the blinks reliable

He only blinked in response to doctors' commands about 50 percent of the time, she said.

Both sides are expected to call 
medical experts to testify about the ability of someone in Woods' 
condition to understand and respond to questions.

Other witnesses expected to be called
include a priest who was a friend to Chandler and gave him money before
the shooting, Prem said. A man who was in jail with Woods will testify 
that Woods told him that he didn't mean to kill Chandler but that he was
angry that Chandler owed him money for drugs and was trying to buy 
drugs from someone else, Prem said.

The judge has said that the trial could take up to three weeks.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
