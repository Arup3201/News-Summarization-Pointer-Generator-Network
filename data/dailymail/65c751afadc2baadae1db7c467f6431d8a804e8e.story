A grieving mother was left sickened after her son's jailed killer was pictured laughing  on Facebook.

Jay Whiston, 17, was stabbed to death in a savage attack by Edward Redman, who has since been sent to prison.

But just months after the murderer was sentenced, he was pictured on Facebook joking with his brother.

Jay's mother Caroline Shearer says the online photo shows why prison is seen as a soft touch by many criminals.

Just months after Edward Redman (right) was jailed for the murder of 17-year-old Jay Whiston, his brother posted this picture of them together on Facebook, next to the caption: 'Top day with my brother'

The photo was posted online by Redman's brother in November, six months after Redman was jailed, next to the caption: 'Top day with my brother'.

It shows Redman, dressed in a white T-shirt, smiling as he puts his arm round his brother. When a friend asked the brother when the picture was taken, he replied: 'Today mate'.

Jay's mother Ms Shearer has been left furious by the post and has complained to justice authorities. 

She said: 'It's disgusting. It's the sort of photo you pay to have taken on holiday. This person is in prison for murder - not for pinching a packet of sweets or not paying his council tax.

'He took my son's life. It's not even a year since he was sentenced. No wonder people aren't scared to go to prison.'

Mrs Shearer says she will make a formal complaint and has already contacted Essex police commissioner Nick Alston.

The photo of Redman was posted by his brother, who captioned the picture: 'Top day with my brother'

Mr Alston's office said they understood the shock Jay's family felt and would support her complaint.

Photos of serving inmates in jail can only be released with the prison governor's permission.

Mrs Shearer said: 'Apparently you can have photos taken in prison. They shouldn't be put on Facebook or social media, but they obviously didn't give a damn.'

She has also written to Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling.

Redman stabbed Jay in Colchester, Essex in September 2012, at a party which had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter.

Jay - described as 'big-hearted' by his family - would have been 20 on Tuesday.

Redman, of Colchester, received a life sentence for the murder and was given a minimum sentence of 17 years in jail earlier this year.

At Redman's trial, CCTV images were shown which police believe show the moments he realised Jay had died

At his trial, CCTV emerged from a bus he boarded after the attack, which appeared to show the moment he heard of Jay's death.

Redman was shown laughing and joking in the footage, as he reads messages on his phone from friends at the murder scene.

His mood suddenly changes as he puts his hand to his mouth, the moment police believe he was told that Jay had died from his wounds.

At the end of Redman's trial, Ms Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly emotional victim impact statement.

She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out. Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do.

'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb. Jay's heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn't miss it.' 

The Ministry of Justice originally denied that the picture had been taken in prison, but today have admitted that the photo featuring Redman and his brother was taken in jail.

A spokesman said: 'There are strict rules on photographs being taken in prison and we are investigating how this image appeared on Facebook.

'We have apologised for the distress and upset caused to the family of the victim in this case and have taken steps to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.'
