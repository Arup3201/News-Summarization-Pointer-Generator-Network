North Korea is allowing foreigners to take mobile phones into the country for the first time - as long as you don’t call a local.

For years, Pyongyang has told visitors to relinquish their phones at the border until their departure, leaving many tourists without an easy way to communicate with the outside world.

The ritual of handing over phones was part of an exhaustive security check that most visitors face at immigration in North Korea.

Good call: Foreigners will now be able to take their mobile phones into North Korea, but will not be able to use them to phone locals

Now, foreigners can bring mobiles into the country or rent a local handset at the airport, and purchase a local SIM card for use in North Korea.

The SIM card allows them to call most foreign countries, foreign embassies in Pyongyang and international hotels in the North Korean capital.

Mobiles can be rented for around £2 a day and SIM cards cost about £40.

However, foreigners will not have access to the Internet using locally provided SIM cards and they cannot phone South Korea.

Mobile phone use has multiplied in North Korea since Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom built a 3G network there four years ago.

More than a million people are using mobiles in the country, according to Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, which runs Koryolink as part of a joint venture with North Korea's telecommunications ministry called CHEO Technology JV Co.

Increase: Kim Jong-Un, leader of North Korea, which has seen a rise in the number of people using mobiles since a 3G network was built there four years ago

Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to North Korea earlier this month when he urged the country to provide its people with better access to the global internet.

He said that it would be 'very easy' for North Korea to offer Internet on the 3G cellphone network.

'As the world becomes increasingly connected, the North Korean decision to be virtually isolated is very much going to affect their physical world and their economic growth. It will make it harder for them to catch up economically,' he wrote in a Google blog entry posted Sunday.

'It is their choice now, and in my view, it's time for them to start, or they will remain behind.'
