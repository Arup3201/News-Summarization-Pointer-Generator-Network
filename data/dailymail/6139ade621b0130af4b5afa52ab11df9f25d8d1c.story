The University of North Florida's deputy police chief has fended off a carjacker with a gun he was given as a gift when he retired from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

Bill Strudel, 67, was off-duty and running errands on Monday night when he stopped his SUV to buy ice from a machine, and was approached by a group of young men, including an armed 15-year-old.

The teenager demanded he hand over the car and pulled out his gun, which Strudel slapped away.

When Strudel tried to knock the weapon away a second time, the teenager pistol-whipped his forehead, leaving a deep gash and damaging his glasses, the Florida Times-Union reported.

Not to be messed with: Bill Strudel, the University of North Florida's deputy police chief, was running errands when an armed teenage boy demanded his SUV - but the youngster got a bullet in the behind instead

But the police chief pulled his gun from his waist and fired several times, hitting the 15-year-old boy in the buttocks.

He held the teen at gunpoint and several motorists stopped to help until police arrived.

The youngster was taken for treatment and he is in custody. Authorities said they were determining whether his weapon was real or a pellet gun.

University police Chief Frank Mackesy, who drove his deputy to the hospital for treatment, told the Florida Times-Union Strudel needed numerous stitches.

'The suspect messed with the wrong guy,' he said. 'He was responding in a way he was trained to respond. If it had been anybody else out there, I don't know how this would have turned out.'

Support: Strudel's daughter Ashley took to Twitter on Monday to express her admiration of her father

On Facebook, Strudels' wife added that her husband has a bad wound to his nose but has been bandaged up and is doing well.

His daughter Ashley added on Twitter: 'Positive of the evening, telling my dad how he's been dubbed a "badass" by multiple different people... it made him chuckle.' 

According to his bio on the university's website, Strudel joined the department in 2005 after serving with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office for 25 years. He has also taught at police academies.

When he retired from the Jacksonville force, he was given his service weapon, as is customary when an officer leaves after years of service, according to the Florida Times-Union.

'Things you should be stupid enough to do,' his daughter added on Twitter. 'Attempt to rob a 30 year police veteran that teaches new officers to shoot. #lessons learned.'
