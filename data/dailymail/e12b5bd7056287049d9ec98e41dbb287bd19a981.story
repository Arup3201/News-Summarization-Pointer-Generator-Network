An Ebola outbreak that began in Guinea four months ago has turned into a cross-border African crisis that could spread to more countries, the World Health Organisation warned last night.

Despite efforts by health authorities and aid groups to contain its spread, the WHO has recorded 635 infections, including 399 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak started.

The crisis is already the deadliest outbreak since Ebola first emerged in central Africa in 1976, and the number of infections continues to rise. The WHO is calling for drastic action to halt the epidemic.

Luis Sambo, WHO Regional Director for 
Africa, said: ‘This is no longer a country specific outbreak but a 
sub-regional crisis that requires firm action by governments and 
partners.

‘WHO is gravely 
concerned by the on-going cross-border transmission into neighbouring 
countries as well as the potential for further international spread.’

In
 response to the worsening crisis, the WHO said it will convene a 
special meeting of health ministers from 11 countries in Ghana on July 2
 and 3 to develop an inter-country response plan.

Ebola

 - with a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent, no vaccine and no known 
cure - has not previously occurred in the West Africa region. People 
there have become frightened of health facilities, blaming them for 
importing and spreading the virus.

The Ebola virus initially causes raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and weakness, before moving into more severe phases with vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external haemorrhaging.

'This is no longer a country specific outbreak but a sub-regional crisis that requires firm action by governments and partners'

Luis Sambo, World Health Organisation

Mr Sambo said: ‘There is an urgent need to intensify response efforts; to promote cross-border collaboration and information sharing of suspected cases and contacts... and to mobilise all sectors of the community.

'This is the only way that the outbreak will be effectively addressed.’

Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said this week that a lack of understanding has meant people continue to prepare corpses and attend funerals of victims, leaving them vulnerable to a disease transmitted by touching victims or via bodily fluids.

MSF accused civil society groups, governments and religious authorities of failing to acknowledge the scale of the epidemic, resulting in few prominent figures promoting the fight against the disease.
