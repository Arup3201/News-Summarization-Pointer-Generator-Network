The 'Canterbury Cannibal' Dale Bolinger was an idol to a worldwide network of men obsessed with the rape, murder and the 'eating to death' of women.

But his obsession with consuming human flesh and death started as a six-year-old and may have been strengthened by the death of his son, Martin, as a one-year-old baby.

The 57-year-old, who was today found guilty of grooming a girl for sex online, told his trial that his fetish was also driven by anger towards his domineering mother, who made drunken passes at him while he was a teenager.

The father-of-four, who was married for more than 30 years, had a secret double life as 'meatmarketman', a stalwart user of the sinister Dark Fetish Network where he got pleasure from fantasising about the most sickening crimes.

Investigation: Dale Bolinger, pictured with a snake draped around his shoulders, was arrested after his  connection to New York's 'Cannibal Cop' case emerged, which revealed how he was at the centre of a worldwide network of men obsessed with the rape, murder and eating of women

His closest confident was the 'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle, who was convicted of plotting to kidnap, murder and eat women, although this verdict was later overturned.

The pair bonded as they discussed a joint plan to kidnap a schoolgirl 'slut' in America.

Bolinger
 had regularly boasted he had eaten the 'sweet' flesh of a white child 
and a black woman, but when arrested said these claims were 'jokes' and 
'all a fantasy'.

He
 maintained his perversion 'never went beyond the chat room' but later 
it emerged he had set up a meeting with a German 14-year-old he planned 
to slice up and eat.

Bolinger began having fantasies about cannibalism at the age of six and would daydream at nursery about girls being taken to the kitchen to be cooked and eaten.

'By the time I got to 14, I turned into the villain of the piece and I wondered what it would be like to eat a girl,' he had said.

He blamed his 'very domineering' and 'weird' mother for his behaviour, particularly because she made drunken sexual advances towards him when he was a teenager.

Bolinger's U.S. Air Force father was absent, so he says he was suppressed by his mother.

His cannibalism fetish 'was less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger', he said.

'I think it was more to do with disliking my mother more than hating women.'

He trained as a nurse at the The Princess Alexandra School of Nursing in 1979, later working on the cardiac ward in Margate.

He married his wife Rosemary in Stepney east London and they were together until two years ago.

They had four children, 
including a boy called Martin who had died before the age of one.

Bolinger told his trial that his sexual fantasies were limited to cartoons of cannibalism, but these led him to the Dark Fetish Network where he spoke to people 'willing to accept anything'.

Gilberto Valle, who could have faced life in prison, was acquitted of kidnapping conspiracy charges, the most serious count he faced

Evidence: Emails and message exchanged between Dale Bolinger, 57, a NYPD police officer Gilberto Valle, 28, where they discussed their fantasies to abduct women and cook them in the oven or on a spit

Desires: Both men talk about who they would eat and meatmarketman said the meat of black women is 'very very good'

He

 claimed he would say things to try to shock the people he was chatting 
and enjoyed how people came to him for advice where he claimed he would 
fabricate gruesome stories about eating women and children.

He 
told the jury: 'Initially, I was looking to find people with like minds 
and to see where they came from, but it soon spiralled down into trying 
to shock people'.

It was there he got to know Gilberto Valle, who he spoke to regularly when he was not working for the NHS on the Kent coast.

An email in Bolinger's name said he would be happy to fly to Valle to help him kill and butcher a 
woman, offering to bring anaesthetic gas and a meat cleaver.

Valle 
responded that he had 'measured the oven' and would cook her after they 
hit her over the head with a baseball bat and kept her 'naked...trussed 
and gagged' in the boot on the drive from Maryland to the police 
officer's home in New York.

The nurse's plan was uncovered by the FBI - who found him posting about murder, rape and cannibalism on a site called Dark Fetish Network. The organisation then alerted British police who arrested the man last year

The
 Canterbury resident had egged on his American associate, also using the
 alias Moody Blues, and even recommended eating a victim alive, saying 
'I think of it as eating her to death.'

By 
kidnapping and eating a variety of women they could evade capture, 
unlike the Yorkshire Ripper, he added, saying, 'Girls go missing all the
 time'.

But it never 
happened because Bolinger, who also called himself Christopher Collins, 
said: 'I've been let down before, that's why I tend to work alone.'

However, they still chatted before and after work about their fantasies of cutting living victims' feet off and barbecuing them 
before their eyes. Feet meat was a delicacy, Bolinger claimed.

When
 Valle suggested a particular woman as a victim. Moody Blues said he 
would like her liver 'lightly cooked to keep it sweet and tender'. Valle replied: 'I'm dying to taste some girl meat.'

Moody Blues responded: 'The meat isn't quite like pork, but very "meaty" ... I've eaten a black woman and a white person'.

The
 English cannibalism enthusiast also bragged about his own eating 
habits, spelling out a recipe for 'human haggis' using lungs and stomach 
and how he used the fat 
from female breasts to make Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes.

Their transatlantic relationship ended last year when Valle was arrested. His trial heard that among his intended victims were his 
wife and other acquaintances, one a New York primary school teacher.

Valle insisted to his British correspondent he was 
serious about his plans and also discussed them with other Americans and a butcher in India who said there was an oven to cook 
Valle's wife in in Pakistan.

In March 2013 he was convicted of plotting to kidnap, murder and eat women and also was found guilty of accessing a national crime database.

He was told he faced life in prison and had served 21 months when a federal judge overturned his conviction for a plot to kidnap, kill and eat young women because he believed it was 'role-play'.

Judge Paul Gardephe ruled that insufficient evidence to support the conviction and his 'Internet communications 
about kidnapping are fantasy'.

It led to Valle apologising for his views, but reiterated the argument of his legal team that 'ugly thoughts' are not a crime.

During the trial FBI agents had alerted British police to the internet exchanges between Valle and his friend Bolinger.

He was arrested at the Kent hospital where he worked 
and police found photographs of him posing with the axe on his computer.

Police searched the 57-year-old suspect's garden sheds and started digging in his garden.

Bolinger was released on bail and returned to his rented £100,000 end-of-terrace former council 
house to find the international press at his gate.

Asked if he had plotted to murder and eat his victims he said: 'I do deny them. None of this is real. It is all fantasy. I have 
spoken to the police and they are undertaking inquiries.'

He
 added: 'It was my stupidity. Because of going online and saying stupid 
things and putting stupid things about, thinking that it was funny.'

This month his trial started at Canterbury Crown Court and heard how he planned to to kill and eat a 14-year-old girl as he groomed her for sex online.

In September 2012, he exchanged messages with a girl called ‘Eva Gonza’, whose true identity has never been discovered.

The pair agreed to meet at  Ashford International rail station, Kent, but the teenager did not appear, the court was told.

Bolinger told officers he would have called police and social services if the girl had turned up and He denied sexually grooming a child.

His arrest and trial cost him his family life, after he split with his wife in 2012 after 32 years of marriage.

The director of a company linked to the disability charity Scope, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy 15 years ago.

She has long lobbied for 
better access for the disabled, even appearing on Radio 4 and in 
newspapers, as well as pressing Gordon Brown for change when he was 
premier.

Speaking at the 
former marital home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, she said: 'I don't know 
anything about the arrest. We are separated. I haven't seen him for over
 a year. He is my husband in law only'.
