A four-day ceasefire in Syria came to a bloody end yesterday after a car bomb killed ten people in Damascus and government jets bombed the suburbs.

President Bashar al-Assad's regime and several rebel groups accepted a truce arranged by Lakhdar Brahimi over the religious holiday of Eid al-Adha.

By the close of the pact, each side had blamed the other for repeatedly breaching it.

‘I am deeply disappointed that the 
parties failed to respect the call to suspend fighting,’ Ban said in 
South Korea, where he was visiting to receive the Seoul Peace Prize.

‘This crisis cannot be solved with more weapons and bloodshed ... the guns must fall silent,’ he said.

Brahimi, after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, voiced regret that the ceasefire had not worked better. Asked whether U.N. peacekeepers might be sent to Syria, he said there was no immediate plan for that.

Although President Bashar al-Assad’s government and several rebel groups accepted the plan to stop shooting over the Muslim religious holiday, it failed to stem the bloodshed in a 19-month-old conflict that has already cost at least 32,000 lives.

Syrian state television said women and children were among those killed by a ‘terrorist car bomb’ near a bakery in Jaramana, in the southeast of Damascus. Damascus residents say the district is controlled by Assad loyalists.

State media said Assad’s armed opponents had broken the truce throughout the Eid.

‘For the fourth consecutive day, the armed terrorist groups in Deir al-Zor continued violating the declaration on suspending military operations which the armed forces have committed to,’ state news said, later adding that rebels had attacked government forces in Aleppo and the central city of Homs.

The Damascus air raids followed what residents said were failed attempts by troops storm eastern parts of the city.

‘Tanks are deployed around Harat al-Shwam (district) but they haven’t been able to go in. They tried a week ago,’ said an activist who lives near the area and who asked not to be named.

Brahimi, who will visit Beijing after Moscow, said the renewed violence in Syria would not discourage him.

‘We think this civil war must end ... and the new Syria has to be built by all its sons,’ he said. ‘The support of Russia and other members of the Security Council is indispensable.’

Russia and China have vetoed three Western-backed U.N. draft resolutions condemning Assad’s government for the violence.
