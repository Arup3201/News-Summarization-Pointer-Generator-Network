Andy Murray has gained a fiancee but lost two of his key lieutenants with his life set to change on different fronts.

Before it emerged that he was engaged to long-time girlfriend Kim Sears, he announced a distinctly inharmonious separation from two other constants in his life over recent years — assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green.

Decidedly less romantic it may be, but the latter development will have more immediate impact on a career that the Scot hopes still has five seasons to run.

The departure of Vallverdu and Green distances him further from the glory of the Ivan Lendl era and cements his relationship with Amelie Mauresmo.

Lendl, who guided Murray to the US Open, Wimbledon and Olympic titles, last night told Sportsmail: ‘As you know, I think very highly of Dani and Jez and their work.’

With their exit, officially described as ‘mutual’ but inevitably more complicated than that, the 27-year-old Scot has reaffirmed his faith in Mauresmo.

A brief statement brought to an end Vallverdu’s five and Green’s seven years of solid service. ‘We sat down at the end of the season and decided a change would be best for all of us,’ said Murray, who flew yesterday to Manila to begin his lucrative stint in the inaugural International Tennis Premier League.

‘My off-season training and Australian Open preparations have already begun and I am very excited for the new year. I thank Jez and Dani for all their hard work over the years and wish them the best for the future.’

That may be true as far as it goes, but the reasons behind the split lie in the growing influence of Mauresmo and the differences of opinion in the camp that have developed since her arrival.

It is known that Murray’s long-time friend Vallverdu has not enjoyed working with the 35-year-old Frenchwoman.

Both Vallverdu and Green only discovered that Mauresmo’s appointment was on the cards when they read Sportsmail’s exclusive revelation during the French Open that the groundbreaking move was imminent.

Their upset at being kept out of the loop became more clear after Murray lost in this summer’s Wimbledon quarter-final, although things appeared to have settled down thereafter.

In recent weeks when he went on a tear through Asia and Europe to qualify for the Barclays ATP World Finals, Murray went out of his way to give credit to Vallverdu (the Venezuelan was there through Asia, while Mauresmo was absent). But after Murray’s 6-0, 6-1 defeat by Roger Federer in the Tour Finals, Vallverdu is said to have made it clear he was unhappy. He had been in charge since Lendl walked out in March and was effectively demoted when Mauresmo came on board.

Murray has always been ruthless when making coaching changes. In his senior career he has gone through Mark Petchey, American Brad Gilbert, Miles Maclagan and former Spanish star Alex Corretja.

Murray and Green are said to have disagreed about training. Green wanted to stick with the uncompromising routines of old that turned Murray into a super-athlete, while the player is said to favour a more nuanced approach as he heads into his late twenties.

I understand that the trainer recently undertook some work with the hugely promising 17-year-old German Alexander Zverev, and that has also been a source of friction between the pair.

While Murray is now set to work more full time with his London-based trainer, Matt Little, he is likely to bring in a replacement for Vallverdu to work under Mauresmo.

Many former top players are privately sceptical about whether she can take him on (but anxious about saying it publicly for fear of being accused of sexism).

In the final analysis, to finish ranked sixth in a season returning from back surgery is a fine effort, but since he and Mauresmo teamed up the only sign of his Wimbledon-winning form has come in the first two sets of the US Open quarter-final against Novak Djokovic.

Otherwise Murray has had to rely on his fighting instincts to beat lesser players and scoop his three ATP titles since late September.

He insists that only next season can the partnership be judged, and Mauresmo will have to instil in him a more dynamic and aggressive style if he is to seriously challenge the top three once again.
