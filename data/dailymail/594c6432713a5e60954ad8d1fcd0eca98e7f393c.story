Anthony Howard, 46, allegedly told an underage boy he would give him hundreds of pounds a month if their relationship changed, a court heard today

A primary school head teacher fondled a teenage boy and offered him hundreds of pounds if their ‘relationship changed’, a court heard today.

Andrew Howard, 46, is alleged to have showered him with presents and outings and asked the schoolboy to say he loved him, Winchester Crown heard.

The offences were said to have taken 
place at Howard’s home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and in a car after Howard 
was said to have confided in the boy, then under 16, that he was gay, the jury 
heard.

Howard, who was in charge of Velmead 
Junior School in Fleet, Hampshire, but is now suspended, took the 
youngster to football, cricket and tennis games and even bought Olympic 
tickets.

The headteacher, dressed in a black suit, checked shirt and tie, bowed his head in the dock as details of the allegations were revealed.

Matthew Jewell, prosecuting, told the court that Howard, from Chineham, Hampshire, spent 'quite a lot of money' on treats and days out for the boy, but he crossed the line by touching the child in his car and on his sofa at his two-bedroom house during what he called 'sofa time'.

He also offered to give the boy a monthly allowance if their relationship changed, the jury was told.

The distressed child, then aged 14-15, told police the headteacher’s unwanted advances - including hugging him and not letting go - made him feel ‘uncomfortable’.

The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who is not a past or present pupil at Velmead, is now 18 and is due to give evidence in court from behind a screen.

Parts of his two-and-a-half hour police interview have been played to the jury of five men and seven women on DVD.

Referring to a night in late 2010, the boy said Howard had told him he wanted an important chat.

The alleged victim said: 'He said he was gay and in a relationship with a guy called Ian in Southampton for the last few years...

Justice: A jury at Winchester Crown Court heard that the head-teacher denied the charges against him

'Howard said he had to make a choice between staying with Ian and me.  He said he was attracted to me and was prepared to give me more money if the relationship between me and him changed.

'He also said because he was not with Ian any more, he wanted to hug me and kiss me.  He also said he didn’t want me to tell my parents and that was a fair thing to ask.

'I said "Yes, that was fair" because I felt uncomfortable.'

Later that week, Howard offered to give the boy three different amounts of money a month ‘depending on what he decided’, the boy said.

The boy added: 'He said he was prepared to give me  £150, £200 or £400 a month depending on what I decided.

'I said I didn’t want to talk about it because I didn’t want to find out what which option entailed.'

The boy first made a complaint about Howard at the end of 2011 but no prosecution resulted from it.

He claims Howard put his hand on his thigh and touched him sexually in the car and on the sofa.  In the car in June 2010, he alleges Howard told him he loved him and wanted him to ‘say that back’.

 'When he was driving his hand would be on my thigh and touching my private bits and I expressed that I did not like that happening but he would carry on and say we would need to compromise over it'

He recalled how Howard would make him sit down and look through gifts he had bought him.

The alleged victim said: 'He would want me to look through what he had got me and he called that ‘sofa time’.

'I did not like it but he just said it was what we had to do.'

He added: 'There was a lot of feeling and touching which I did not like and expressed that.

'Where he was driving his hand would be on my thigh and touching my private bits and I expressed that I did not like that happening but he would carry on and say we would need to compromise over it.'

As well as giving him cash for sweets and presents, Howard would ring him after 10pm at night, the trial heard.

The child said: 'He was saying not to tell anyone and if I wanted anything to email him the [internet] links and he would get it for me and give it to me the next time he saw me.'

Howard bought him a Samsung LG mobile phone on a rolling contract and then a Blackberry in August 2011, but cancelled this in August 2012, the court heard.

He would sign off his text messages 'A' or 'MC2', which stood for the nickname 'Midnight Chum'.

Howard was again interviewed by police last November when he made another complaint and the defendant was arrested and made a statement.

Howard, who denies two charges of sexual activity with a child, was formally suspended from his post when the accusations came to light.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
