Everyone has off their days - even apes when they're not monkeying around.

Indeed, wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 43, captured a particularly gloomy-looking guy at the Jacksonville Zoo in Florida recently.

However the moment took a jolly twist, as a concerned pal stepped in and grabbed the primate's face to push it into a grin instead of a grimace.

McGeorge managed to catch the heart-warming moment between the two primates on camera.

The gesture highlights the species' human-like behavior.

Other touching moments caught by McGeorge show adult bonobos playing with their young and grooming each other from head to toe.

Endangered in the wild because of the destruction of their forest homes and hunting for the bush meat trade, there are thought to be only 50,000 bonobos left alive in the wild.

They live only in the Democratic Republic of Congo and like human babies but, unlike other apes, they are born helpless relying totally on their mothers for food and warmth.

Kissing it better: Wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 43, recently spent an afternoon at the Jacksonville Zoo in Florida to catch a group of bonobos in action

Dwindling numbers: There are thought to be 50,000 bonobos left alive in the wild 

McGeorge, who is originally from Scotland but now lives just ten miles from Jacksonville Zoo, said: 'Bonobos are my favourite primate at the zoo.'

'I spend hours each trip just watching the mannerisms of the bonobo and their young.'

'I try to capture the interaction between mother and baby - and how the rest of the pack protects thee young members of their family.

'I always leave the zoo with a successful feeling.' 

Jacksonville Zoo's first bonobos arrived in March 1998. 

They have successfully bred at the park since. The seventh birth took place this past fall. 

In the wild, they eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, shoots, bark and meat.

In captivity they are fed special pellets, leafy greens, fruit and vegetables.
