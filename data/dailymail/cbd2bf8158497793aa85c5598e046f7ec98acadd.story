With the EU voting on plans that would see all washing-up gloves rigorously tested — meaning prices will rise by 20 per cent — should you stock up on before it’s too late? Alice Smellie rolled up her sleeves to find out . . .

THE ORIGINAL — AND BEST?

Extra-life Kitchen Gloves by Marigold

Extra-life Kitchen Gloves by Marigold, £2.50, Ocado.com

THE GLOVE: Thick yellow latex, with roll-top cuffs. Cotton-lined for comfort.

THE TEST: Rubber gloves were created in 1889 by a surgeon to protect the hands of medical staff, with the first Marigolds made in 1947 for domestic use. I road-test them on a two-day-old lasagne dish that is encrusted with burnt cheese and mince. Although the water is scaldingly hot, I don’t feel the heat and even use my rubber-covered fingers to chip away stubborn bits of food.

BACTERIA BASHERS

Anti-Bac Gloves by Lakeland, £2.99, lakeland.co.uk

THE GLOVE: Certified to eliminate bacteria such as e-coli, salmonella, listeria and MRSA. Also recommended for skin that’s sensitive to latex or nitrile (a type of rubber).

THE TEST: According to Allergy UK, 6 per cent of us have a rubber latex allergy. But adding an anti-bacterial element seems excessive. Surely you are protecting yourself from harmful bacteria by wearing a glove in the first place? But they fit well and unlike others, these aren’t too thick — my fingers easily pick up the smallest of teaspoons from the sink.

A KILLER PAIR

Insulated Hot Food Gloves, £23.99, wayfair.co.uk

Insulated Hot Food Gloves, £23.99, wayfair.co.uk

THE GLOVE: Protects your hands when handling hot food.

THE TEST: As well as being very expensive, these are thick, heavy and an ominous dark, shiny grey. My husband walks into the kitchen and asks: ‘Have you killed someone?’ — and they do look like something a criminal would wear to clean up a murder!

I cook chicken nuggets to perform a heat test. I try to scoop them from the baking sheet, but have to concentrate jolly hard because the gloves are so padded with insulation that dexterity is limited. But I don’t sustain any heat-related injuries, which is the point (they only withstand temperatures of up to 120c, though).

When washing up, you can’t feel hot water, but it’s tricky picking up small objects (or even plates for that matter).

FAILS THE TEASPOON TEST 

True Blues, The Ultimate Household Glove, £9.99, lakeland.co.uk

THE GLOVE: Thick and latex-free. Extremely resistant to strong household cleaners.

THE TEST: A very thick glove, and they feel cumbersome on. They keep my hands safe in very hot water, but the loose fit means that it’s not very easy to pick up a teaspoon.

They’re also machine washable. After cleaning the downstairs loo, I pop them in a wash with tea towels. The next morning, they still aren’t dry, however, so I’m not sure I’d recommend it.

Power Force Rubber Gloves with Anti-Slip Grip, 59p, Aldi

REAL STINKERS

Power Force Rubber Gloves with Anti-Slip Grip, 59p, Aldi

THE GLOVE: Non-slip grip moulded in.

THE TEST: Look and feel like the cheap option. My six-year-old says the inside ‘smells disgusting’. They’re much thinner than the others, and in hot water my hands are sticky and warm after a few minutes. I’d recommend more expensive gloves.

SUPER SCOURERS

Bizzybee Scouring Gloves, £2.40, bizzybee.co.uk

THE GLOVE: One glove has a non-scratch scouring palm; the other is left plain for easy handling.

THE TEST: I often make bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate on a Saturday morning. This means somebody (me) has to wash up a greasy pan and a milky pan afterwards. The gloves have scouring pads running up the fingers and over the top of the finger on the right hand so you can get to tricky corners. They are absolutely brilliant — except for left-handers.

MOISTURISE WHILE YOU SCRUB!

Bizzybee Multi-Purpose Gloves With Moisturiser, £3, bizzybee.co.uk

THE GLOVE: Latex free, with luxury lining.

THE TEST: The inside is so soft it feels like you’re wearing cashmere (to clean the house — how posh!). They look elegant and are comfy, too, while my dexterity with them on is excellent. After washing up, the plates are sparkling and my hands are so soft it’s as if I had a housekeeper do the work for me.

Marigold Extra-Tough Outdoor Gloves

CAR-WASH WONDERS

Marigold Extra-Tough Outdoor Gloves, £2.59, ocado.com

THE GLOVE: Heavy-duty rubber with extra-comfy cotton lining.

THE TEST: I don’t really ‘do’ stuff outside, but I decide to wash my car, which is encrusted in mud. Sure enough, the heavy-duty rubber means my hands don’t get dried out from repeated dipping in the hot water. As an extra test, I tidy up a load of leaves with my hands, which is very easy in these gloves.
