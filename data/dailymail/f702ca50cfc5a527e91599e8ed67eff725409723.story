A man has been shot dead by police in southeast Queensland in the third police shooting in the region in a week.

Officers were called to a street in Southport after 7pm on Monday.

It's alleged the officers were confronted by an armed man before police opened fire, a police spokeswoman said.

The man, believed to be aged in his 30s, suffered a cardiac arrest and was declared dead at the scene.

The Queensland Police ethical standards command will investigate the shooting. Monday's shooting comes after a man was shot dead on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday. 

 A first-year constable and a 10-year veteran senior constable were called to the Tewantin home after residents reported a domestic disturbance.

The Queensland Police Union said officers were immediately confronted by a violent man, who allegedly came at them with an unspecified weapon as they arrived in their patrol car. 

 The officer shot the 51-year-old man in the chest.

Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak told a media conference on Sunday evening that the man shot dead was not from Queensland. 

 'It's a traumatic time for the family and police, you don't come to work to be involved in matters like this.' he said.

Last Tuesday a 33-year-old man was shot by police at Kippa-Ring, north of Brisbane.

Queensland Police were called to reports of a 'disturbance' and officers later shot a 51-year-old man dead 

Sunday's shooting happened in Tewantin on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland

Speaking to the ABC earlier on Monday, Civil Liberties Council vice-president Terry O'Gorman said there needed to be a review of all of the shootings.

'It cannot be left to guess work, it must be a subject of a serious and immediate review,' Mr O'Gorman said.

'The number of shootings is a problem. It is concerning.

'Clearly there is an issue in the number of police shootings in recent times.'
