A chlorine gas leak at a suburban Chicago hotel hosting an annual Midwest furry convention sent 19 people to hospitals because of nausea and dizziness and forced the evacuation of thousands of guests, including many in cartoonish animal costumes.

Investigators believe the early Sunday leak at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in Rosemont was caused intentionally and are treating it as a criminal matter.

The Rosemont Public Safety Department says authorities responded to the hotel at around 12.45am.

Attack on the furries? Furry convention attendees console one another after a chlorine gas release, which police believe was intentional, ruined the annual Midwest FurFest just outside Chicago early Sunday

Gased: Rattled furries, many of them clad in the animal costumes that have become synonymous with their subculture, wait outside the Hyatt Regency O'Hare after a deliberate chlorine gas release

Sabotage: It was evacuated because of high levels of chlorine gas in the air. The source appeared to be powdered chlorine found in a 9th-floor stairwell

Show must go on: Officials assured attendees Sunday afternoon that the convention events would continue as scheduled despite the apparent attack

It was evacuated because of high levels of chlorine gas in the air. The source appeared to be powdered chlorine found in a 9th-floor stairwell.

Police say the manner through which the gas was dispersed 'suggests an intentional act,' reports the Chicago Tribune.

Now police are investigating the incident as a crime.

'It was shocking,' attendee Morgan Smejkal, who was visiting Midwest FurFest from Iowa, told the Tribune.

Photos from the aftermath of the apparent attack showed groups of rattled conventioneers, some still wearing elaborate animal costumes, standing outside the Hyatt as EMTs whisked away those who'd taken ill. 

'A lot of people thought this was just someone pulling the fire alarm,' 27-year-old Thomas Zell told the Tribune. 'But it was serious this time.' 

As the convention returned to its regularly scheduled programming Sunday, event officials struggled to keep an optimistic atmosphere after someone tried ruining the annual celebration of all things furry

 

According to WikiFur:

Someone who says they are furry is generally expressing an interest in anthropomorphic animals and/or creatures (and perhaps some affiliation to).

They may express that that interest in a variety of ways - through art and stories through to roleplay and performance. How deep or meaningful an interest in Furry is varies greatly from person to person.

Some furries look at their affiliation to and/or expression of an anthropomorphic animal--called a fursona--as a means of expressing how they feel they truly are, that is 'an animal in a human body'

Other furries are more akin to Comic Con attendees in that they dress in costumes that mimic their favorite cartoon characters.

Some furries express themselves through the 'fursuiting' that the group has become so synonymous with, but others express their furrydom without the use of actual fur.

Still other furries derive sexual pleasure out of dressing like anthropomorphic animals and may dress in costumes that may be worn during sexual acts. 

Arm-in-arm: The entire Hyatt Regency was evacuated just after 1am Sunday morning

Sickened: Nineteen were taken to hospitals complaining of nausea and dizziness after the gas released

All-clear: The hotel remained evacuated for hours until after 4am, when an all-clear was finally given by a hazmat team

Terrifying: The Hyatt Regency O'Hare was cmopletely evacuated for several hours

Facilities near the Rosemont hotel accommodated guests after the hotel was completely evacuated at 1.10am. 

According to a FurFest statement, a team in full hazmat gear responded to the scene as some attendees waited anxiously outside. 

'At 4:21 AM the all-clear was given and we worked with the Hyatt staff to return all of our guests to the hotel in the quickest and safest manner possible,' reads the FurFest statement.

In spite of the rattling night, the events for Sunday were scheduled to all go on as planned.

'All events scheduled for today will continue to operate on schedule. We are all running on little sleep. Your patience is appreciated,' organizers tweeted Sunday before noon.

The hotel is hosting the 2014 Midwest FurFest convention, where attendees dress as animals to celebrate art, literature and performance.

Chlorine, a chemical used in industry and water purification process, was first introduced as a chemical weapon at Ypres in World War I with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time. 

According to the National Institutes of Health:

Acute exposures can result in symptoms of acute airway obstruction including wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and/or dyspnea.

Clinical signs, including hypoxemia, wheezes, rales, and/or abnormal chest radiographs may be present.

More severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Up to 1% of exposed individuals die.

In October, Iraqi officials said Islamic State (IS) militants used chlorine gas during fighting with security forces and Shiite militiamen in September north of Baghdad.

In the attacks, about 40 troops and Shiite militiamen were slightly affected by the chlorine and showed symptoms consistent with chlorine poisoning, such as difficulty in breathing and coughing, the three officials said. The troops were treated in hospital and quickly recovered.

In neighboring Syria, a joint U.N. fact-finding mission sent to investigate alleged chlorine attacks was ambushed and briefly detained by armed men earlier this year in rebel-held territory. The mission had said it was virtually certain chlorine had been used as a chemical weapon in the country's north. 

ISIS forces have used chlorine gas as a weapon, according to Iraqi officials
