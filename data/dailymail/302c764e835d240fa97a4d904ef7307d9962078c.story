An Army handbook advising American soldiers to not speak badly of the Taliban, advocate women's rights or criticize pedophilia in Afghanistan has been leaked, to particular disapproval by the U.S.’ commanding Afghan general.

The proposed 75-page document, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, suggests soldiers' ignorance of Afghan culture is partially to blame for a rise in deadly insider attacks, with more than three dozen reported this year.

'Many of the confrontations occur because of [coalition] ignorance of, or lack of empathy for, Muslim and/or Afghan cultural norms, resulting in a violent reaction from the [Afghan security force] member,' a portion of the draft obtained by the Journal reads.

Leak: A proposed handbook intended for U.S. soldiers that briefs them on how to properly handle Afghan culture has been leaked to the ardent disapproval of the U.S.' commanding Afghan general

Of those attacks, around 63 members of the U.S.-led coalition were killed by Afghan soldiers.

But reacting with ardent disapproval to the handbook's advisory is top military commander in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Gen John Allen.

'Gen. Allen did not author, nor does he intend to provide, a foreword,' Col. Tom Collins, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan told the Journal of the draft. 'He does not approve of its contents.'

Lt. Gen. David Perkins, commander of the Army's Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth whose Center for Army Lessons Learned wrote the manual, expressed its defense, however.

Lt Perkins tells the Journal that the draft is still under revision and will be amended with Gen Allen's guidance taken into full consideration.

The suggested cultural clash behind the attacks is one already rejected by the U.S.-led coalition last year.

In 2011 an international military study titled A Crisis of Trust and Cultural Incompatibility found that cultural insensitivities were partially to blame for the insider killings.

Work by at least one major who headed that study, Maj Jeffrey Bordin, does appear in this new drafted handbook, according to Lt Perkins.

'We are very serious in trying to solve this problem, so we are not discounting any insights that we think are useful,' he told the Journal. 'We are pulling out all the stops to do everything we can to gather lessons learned.'

'Better situational awareness/understanding of Afghan culture will help better prepare [troops] to more effectively partner and to avoid cultural conflict that can lead toward green-on-blue violence,' the draft reasons.

Additional notes of caution for U.S. troops provided in the handbook’s current draft are direct criticism of Afghans, mentioning homosexuality or homosexual conduct and anything related to Islam.
