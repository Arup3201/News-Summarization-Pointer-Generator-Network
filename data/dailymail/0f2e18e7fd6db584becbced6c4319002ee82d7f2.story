A funeral home in a small town in Pennsylvania has added a motorcycle hearse to its lineup last month in hopes of better serving bereaved bikers by bearing their deceased loved ones to the afterlife with a thunderous roar.

Heintzelman Funeral Home six months ago tapped Orange County Chopper in Newburgh, New York, to craft a one-of-a-kind two-wheeled hearse with all the trimmings, including an S&S V111 engine and a reverse gear that allows it to back up, according to a press release on the company's website.

'The last thing they want is to be in a four-wheel drive vehicle,' said David Heintzelman, co-owner of the Hellertown-based funeral home. 'They want noise and they want speed.'

Paul Teutel Sr, a co-founder of Orange County Chopper who earned television notoriety on the reality series American Chopper, designed the stretch motorcycle, according to WFMZ.com.

'It is a chopper, and it is class,' Heintzelman, who declined to specify the price he paid, told WFMZ. 'The paint is second-to-none. I am so
 proud of the paint job. It is a black metal flake with some ghosting of
 gold and metal gray,'

The hearse can be detached from the motorcycle so that it can be ridden independently of the carriage

Paul Teutel Sr, co-founder of Orange County Chopper and a star of the reality TV series American Chopper, helped design the motorcycle hearse

The toughest part, he said, was figuring out how to attach the casket-carriage to the bike because of the weight distribution, a process that took weeks of preparation. In the end, Orange County designed it with a 'quick disconnect' that allows the motorcycle to be used separately from the casket.

The funeral home charges $395 to $595, depending on distance, for the service, for the 'Harley Davidson Hearse with a licensed funeral director as its driver' and wearing the 'attire of all Harley riders.'

As for why he did it, Heintzelman said it only makes sense to let people who spent their lives on a motorcycle take their final journey on one as well. The funeral home also offers clients the option of using a horse-drawn coach , in addition to the more conventional Cadillac and Lincoln hearses.

'Those who are bikers, understand and know, they live and breathe the 
road,' he said.

But the motorcycle hearse doesn't appeal only to bikers, Heintzelman said.

'I actually had a person who had died, a female who was never on a 
motorcycle, that was in her late 80s,' he said. Her children 'saw a picture of [the motorcycle hearse] in my arrangement conference room, and they thought this was so cute and
 unique, they wanted to have that for their mom.'
