West Brom's main sponsor Zoopla have announced that they will end their deal with the club at the end of the season.

Zoopla have been reviewing their £3million-a-year agreement with Albion following Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' celebration at West Ham on December 28. The property website say they will focus their attention on other marketing activities at the end of this campaign.

Anelka was named in the starting line-up 
for West Brom's match with Everton on Monday night at the Hawthorns, 
Pepe Mel's first game in charge of the club.

Finished: Anelka's time could be over at West Brom depending on the FA hearing for this quenelle gesture

'Zoopla pay £3million to sponsor West Bromwich Albion. That gives them the right to spoil the famous striped shirts a little, but not to pick the team.'

West Brom also issued the a statement on Monday evening to clarify its position with Zoopla:

It said: ‘West Bromwich Albion has been fully aware since the sponsorship agreement came into force in June 2012 that its partnership with Zoopla could expire this summer and therefore has been planning accordingly.

‘Zoopla has today informed the club in writing that it does not wish to extend its sponsorship deal. The club will now actively seek a new official sponsor for next season.’

The FA are due to make a decision on Tuesday over whether to take action against Anelka for the gesture which is widely considered as anti-Semitic.

Head of Communications for Zoopla, 
Lawrence Hall said, 'Through our sponsorship of West Bromwich Albion we 
are pleased to have supported the local community and charities.

'In 
recent weeks, however, we have decided to re-evaluate this sponsorship 
and as a result we will focus our attention on other marketing 
activities from the end of the season.'

Offended: Pepe Mel (right) has picked the striker but his 'quenelle' gesture has offended many

Zoopla announced on Monday that it will not seek to renew its sponsorship of West Brom at the end of the season in light of Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' gesture.

The property website, which is co-owned by a Jewish businessman, was unhappy at the continuing presence of Anelka in the team while his actions were investigated by the Football Association.

Here, Sportsmail looks at other examples of unhappy sponsors who have pulled the plug on deals because they thought their brand was being damaged.

LANCE ARMSTRONG

Cyclist Lance Armstrong lost a whole raft of sponsors after he was exposed as a drugs cheat.

Losing out: American Lance Armstrong, who won the Tour de France seven times before being disqualified for doping offences, was dropped by a raft of sponsors

Nike terminated its 16-year association with the shamed cyclist and a number of others followed suit. Brewer Anheuser-Busch opted against renewing its contract with Armstrong.

Wisconsin based Trek-Bicycle Corp severed its contract with him. Armstrong's helmet sponsor Giro pulled its deal with the American, as did Oakley, who produced his sunglasses. Honey Stinger, a honey-based nutrition goods company, removed Armstrong's image from all of its product packaging and a chain of gyms also removed his name from its logo.

ASAFA POWELL

Chinese sportswear company Li-Ning suspended its sponsorship of Asafa Powell after the Jamaican sprinter returned a positive doping test.

Powell tested positive for oxilofrine - a stimulant used to boost the body's ability to burn fat - in June 2012.

The former 100metre world record holder blamed trainer Chris Xuereb for supplying the drug, although he denied he was culpable.

Li-Ning has vowed to cancel their contract with Powell if he is banned at a hearing in February.

TIGER WOODS

Tiger Woods lost more than his marriage to Elin Nordegren after revelations about his infidelity emerged towards the end of 2009. Accenture, a global consulting firm, was the first sponsor to sever ties with Woods.

Telecommunications giant AT&T also ended their association with Woods.

Tag Heuer, Proctor and Gamble and Gatorade also decided against renewing their deals with the star, although the latter claimed the move had nothing to do with Woods' affairs.

STEPHANIE RICE

Stephanie Rice was on top of the world when she won three gold medals at Beijing 2008, but two years later she made a teary apology in front of the media following a homophobic tweet.

Jaguar terminated its sponsorship deal with the Australian swimmer and demanded she return the £55,000 Jaguar XF which was given to her free as part of the contract.

OSCAR PISTORIUS

Pistorius' profile reached its peak around the London Paralympics, but his sponsors started to distance themselves from the double-amputee after he was charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013.

Nike and Oakley suspended their contracts with the 'Blade Runner'. Fashion house Thierry Mugler, which chose Mr Pistorius as the face of its A*Men fragrance, withdrew all its campaigns featuring the athlete, as did another backer, M-Net Movies.

Pistorius will stand trial for the shooting of Steenkamp in March. Pistorius denies the charge.
