A 13-month old boy died from internal bleeding after swallowing a battery, an inquest heard.

Wsam Noorwali was rushed to hospital when his parents found him vomiting blood at their home in Hamilton, Leicester.

Just under nine hours later he was pronounced dead, and a post-mortem examination revealed a three-volt disc battery the size of a 2p piece in the toddler’s stomach.

At an inquest into the little boy's 
death at Leicester Town Hall, his father Ammar, 32, said he believed the
child had swallowed the battery at the nursery he attended in the city.

Beloved son: Little Wsam was taken ill at home - his father saw him vomiting blood at their home in Leicester

Mr Noorwali said he found his son in pain on the evening on 18 August last year.

He said: 'At about 10pm, the family was downstairs in the living room.  I went upstairs to go to the toilet and Wsam must have crawled up after me.

'When I left the bathroom, I heard him crying and saw him at the door to my bedroom.

'I saw him vomit blood.'

Mr Noorwali, a PhD researcher at Leicester De Montfort University, took Wsam in his car, with wife Fatima and their other son, to the city’s Royal Infirmary hospital.

The hearing was told Wsam was assessed by a doctor at the children’s emergency department before being moved to a ward.

His condition at first improved, but at 2.30am and 4am, he suffered further bouts of vomiting.

The youngster was given a blood 
transfusion and transferred to the children’s intensive care unit, where
his condition deteriorated.

The little boy may have picked up the battery at the nursery he attended, his father Ammar told an inquest

Wsam''s parents described their toddler as a 'wonderful', 'happy' boy who was 'always smiling'

He was given another blood 
transfusion, but doctors said he was too weak for an emergency 
operation. Wsam’s heart stopped and medical staff were unable to revive 
him.

Mr
Noorwali said: 'We were asked to go outside but a while later I saw 
doctors and medical staff run past us into the emergency unit.'

He added medics tried and tried to save Wsam but after an hour they told him his son had died.

Mr
Noorwali told the inquest he was convinced his son had swallowed 
something and pleaded with doctors to investigate, but to no avail.

He said: 'I told them I thought he may have swallowed something which was stuck in his throat, but the doctor said "We need to cure him first, leave it to me".

Mrs Noorwali said at one point her husband was so angry he was warned about his behaviour.

'I told them I thought he may have swallowed something which was stuck in his throat but the doctor said "We need to cure him first, leave it to me".'

'One doctor said to my husband "If you continue to behave like this we are going to call security",' she said.

Mr Noorwali said they did not see Wsam swallow anything in the days before his death - but added he was prone to putting things in his mouth.

He ruled out the battery coming from the family home and said he suspected Wsam could have swallowed it at the nursery he attended in Leicester.

He told the inquest a member of staff told him they had once found Wsam playing with rubbish in the office bin.

James Stafford, owner of the nursery,
which was not named during the hearing, said it was not possible Wsam 
could have been playing with rubbish because the door was always closed 
and the office always attended.

He said none of the toys in the playroom had disc batteries.

Dr Roger Malcomson, who carried out the post-mortem examination on Wsam, said he found a three-volt disc battery 'corroded at the edges' which was the size of a 2p piece in the boy’s stomach.

Dr Malcomson said he found evidence of extensive bleeding in the stomach, with burning and tissue damage to Wsam’s gullet which suggested the battery could have been stuck there for several days.

He told the hearing the vomiting fit could have dislodged the battery, causing it to pass into the stomach, where it would have caused the damage it did in a few hours.

The inquest continues.

Outside the inquest, Mr Noorwali said: 'Wsam was a wonderful boy.  He was playing all the time and seemed so happy.

'He was always smiling and loved playing with his older brother.  He was just starting to walk and talk and we miss him very much.'

He added: 'It has been a very difficult 16 months.'
