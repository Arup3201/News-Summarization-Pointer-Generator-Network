Wigan have received the go-ahead to play their World Club Series clash with Brisbane Broncos at the DW Stadium.

The Grand Final runners up had drawn up contingency plans to take the game on Saturday, February 21, to an alternative venue because it clashed with Wigan Athletic's Sky Bet Championship match against Charlton - but the Latics agreed to bring their fixture forward to the Friday.

Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan said: 'Sometimes clashes like this cannot be helped when two teams share a stadium but Wigan Athletic have been very helpful and we are thankful for that.

'The Wigan club has a great tradition in this competition and talk is already building ahead of what should be a fantastic game with Brisbane.'

The match is part of an expanded World Club Challenge, for which tickets went on sale on Friday.

The action kicks off on Friday, February 20, when Warrington host St George Illawarra and reaches a climax on Sunday, February 22, when Super League champions St Helens take on NRL Grand Final winners South Sydney for the right to be crowned world champions.

Ian Lenagan was delighted that Wigan Athletic allowed Wigan Warriors to use the DW stadium on the Saturday

Souths head coach Michael Maguire, whose Wigan team lost to St George Illawarra in the 2011 World Club Challenge at the DW Stadium, is relishing the opportunity to take on Saints.

'I understand the importance of the World Club Challenge from my time at Wigan and our team can't wait to play for another big title in February,' Maguire said.
