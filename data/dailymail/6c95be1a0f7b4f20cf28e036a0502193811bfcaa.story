Sir Alex Ferguson played host at a charity auction to raise money for UNICEF from the sale of a selection of photographic images depicting his time at Manchester United.

The managerial legend retired in 2013 after 26 years in charge of the Red Devils, which brought an incredible 28 major trophies during a career that is unlikely to ever be equalled in the modern era.

Ferguson attended the event at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening in support of United's official charity partners who are celebrating 15 years together.
