These brave gulls seem to have rather foolishly picked the wrong place to rest while playing in the Atlantic.

Circling the open jaws of a 30-ton whale they look to be ruling the waves as they playfully flock and surround the giant.

One particularly plucky fellow even takes a rest atop his nose, in these pictures, captured off the U.S.

But with a snap of his almighty jaws the angry whale blows his top - literally - and shows the bird who is really boss of the ocean.

These pictures show the flock of herring gulls as they swoop around the whale, trying to snatch fish from its mouth, off the coast of Massachusetts.

Whales trap fish by blowing bubbles around them to stop them escaping.

By cleverly blowing air at depths of 600ft, they create a bubble net that traps their prey near the surface.

Humpbacks
can weigh two tons at birth and grow to more than 45ft and 40 tons when
full size, and need to consume around 3,000lbs of food a day.

They can dive for up to 45 minutes, reach depths of 600ft and blow out air from their blowholes at speeds of 300mph.

Their
lungs can hold 2,500 gallons of air. Every humpback can be identified 
from the unique marking on the underside of its tail.

Once
under threat from whaling ships, thanks to laws protecting them the 
humpback whale population is now increasing each year, with current 
world numbers estimated to be more than 60,000.
