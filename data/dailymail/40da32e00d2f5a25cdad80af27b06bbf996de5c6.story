Ms Collinson, who has been volunteering since the age of 14 and was presented with the British Empire Medal this year, handed over the baton to volunteer Dominic McCreadie, 75.

Launched 12 weeks ago, the baton challenge has since covered 2,500 miles across land and water.

Margaret Paterson, head of Royal Voluntary Service in Scotland, said: 'Our volunteers are not only the lifeblood of Royal Voluntary Service: all volunteers across Scotland are the life and soul of the country.

'The last 12 weeks have seen whole 
communities coming out to support and celebrating volunteering and the 
people it helps and we should all be incredibly proud of our country.

'We really hope people have been inspired to come forward and volunteer - an hour a week is all it takes to help an older person out of loneliness and I hope we've shown volunteering is great fun too.'

While Camilla attracted crowds at the City Chambers, her husband, the Prince of Wales, visited Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh.

The 100-year-old tapestry studio is now 
homed in a renovated Victorian swimming pool, which also hosts

Having a chat: During the visit to the university's music school in Colinton Road, they were treated to performances by musicians from around the globe who are in the city to perform at the festival

They enjoyed a performance by jazz pianist Stephanie Trick, who was later joined on stage by the popular musician and presenter for a duet at the city's Tron Kirk.

Holland, who also performed with his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra as part of the festival, said: 'We performed with the big band last night and it went great, it was a fantastic crowd.

'It's great that the royal couple have come here to shine a light today, because it will draw attention from all over the place to the fact that the jazz festival is on and it's one of the best jazz festivals in the world so we need to let people know about that.

'Their interest and them coming today will expand that everywhere.'

Attracting crowds: Fiona Alexander, producer of the jazz festival, said: 'They loved the jazz and the Duchess actually told me she used to dance the Charleston. We couldn't actually tempt her into any steps though'

Asked if the royals took a keen interest in the festival's music, he said: 'I think they like an occasional quiet knees-up.'

The former Squeeze musician also praised Ms Trick as 'the greatest stride pianist living today'.

Ms Trick, who also played a duet with husband Paolo Alderighi, said: 'This was the first time I have played for royalty so it was quite a thrill.

'I just tried to do the best that I could and of course it's really exciting. They were very, very kind.'
