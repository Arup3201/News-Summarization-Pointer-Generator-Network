When you don’t give the fans what they want, they turn their backs on the team and walk away.

This, we can safely say, was an official protest.

England are perilously close to The Great Depression at international level and it will take more than a 1-0 win over Norway to drag them clear of danger.

Protest: Players line up in front of empty stands for England's international friendly against Norway

Staying away: Wembley is almost empty as players warm up ahead of their first game since Brazil

Empty seats: The attendance of 40,181 was the lowest ever for an England game at the new Wembley

Hangover? Fans' interest has diminished since England's disastrous performance at the 2014 World Cup

Lack of interest: Unless England can pick themselves up, empty seats will become commonplace

Hardcore: Dedicated England fans still turned out to cheer England on but their patience will not last forever

The biggest challenge is to win over the fans, the sceptics who stayed away from Wembley on a night when, frankly, there was nothing else to do.

Good on the 40,000 who trekked to the national stadium to watch a team minus the old favourites — Stevie G and Super Frank — for the first time since that humiliating World Cup exit.

Those lucky fans with £30 tickets arrived in plenty of time because the Underground trains at Baker Street were empty and the roads that are usually a pig to navigate around Wembley were clear. For a tenner you could park closer to the stadium than England’s head coach Roy Hodgson.

Inside, the atmosphere was eerie and uncertain, a throwback to the empty stands at the old stadium when things got really bad under dear old Sir Bobby Robson in the late Eighties.

Attendances of 20,000 to 30,000 were not uncommon at the Twin Towers back then as the FA tried to drum up support for Home Nations and Rous Cup tournaments.

This was a new low, with just over 40,000 turning out to watch the team for the first time since they were booted out of Brazil before 12 teams had even played their second group game.

Wayne Rooney, England’s new captain, pointed out that this would still be the second highest attendance in Europe behind world champions Germany. They lost 4-2 against Argentina in Dusseldorf, so maybe there is hope after all.

The last recognisable protest by England supporters was after the penalty shootout defeat against Portugal in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final in Gelsenkirchen.

A few weeks later, in Steve McClaren’s first game in charge of the national team, 45,864 were at Old Trafford to watch England play Greece. Our splendid new national stadium was still being built.

Under the arch on Wednesday night, they watched the team limp over the line with a 1-0 victory over the world’s 53rd best team, thanks to Rooney’s emphatic finish from the penalty spot.

To regain the trust of the nation, the team will need to gather momentum in a tour of the continent that takes us to Switzerland (on Monday), followed by Estonia, Slovenia, San Marino and Lithuania in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

It isn’t anything to get worked up about.

Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson speaks to his players during a water break at Wembley

Credit to those present on Wednesday night because it would have been very easy to voice disapproval when England trooped off at half-time with the score 0-0.

They were playing against a team who could barely string two passes together and yet we were reminded, as usual, just what a threat Norway were on the break. The atmosphere here was uncomfortable. Everyone wants to see an England team emboldened by the words of Hodgson but — just like the stadium — they are increasingly empty.

They want to believe, we all do, that England can come again at international level and go deep into World Cups and European Championships.

Next generation: Raheem Sterling (L) was part of a youthful Three Lions side selected by Roy Hodgson

Dull: Leighton Baines has an effort on goal during another lacklustre performance from England

The sensible things to do would be to engage with inner-city kids and pay for busloads from deprived areas to come and watch England at Wembley.

Instead, the FA will bombard us with advertising puff ahead of the next international occasion, when San Marino arrive for a none-too-mouthwatering Euro 2016 qualifier on October 10.

Good luck with that.
