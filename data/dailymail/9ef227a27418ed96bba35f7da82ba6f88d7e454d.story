The annual weigh-in for a 6.5m python proved to be a little difficult this year as handlers struggled to retrain the aggressive snake which looked eager to take a bite out of someone's leg.

Atomic Betty, the Australian Reptile Park's largest snake, was put on a diet over the last 12 months.

Her 12-goat feed was reduced to six which resulted in a weight loss of 11kg on Wednesday, bringing her down to a healthy 129kg.

The annual weigh-in for a 6.5m python proved to be a little difficult this year as handlers struggled to retrain the aggressive snake

 Atomic Betty, the Australian Reptile Park's largest snake, was put on a diet over the last 12 months as her 12-goat feed was reduced to six

The 15-year-old snake’s weigh-in on Wednesday found that she lost 11kg, bringing her down to a healthy 129kg

Handlers hope she loses another 9kg in the coming year and will feed her eight goats

It took at least seven handlers to help control Atomic Betty as she had her fangs out, ready to strike at any moment.

Billy Collett, head of reptiles, says he's happy with her current weight but would like to see her lose another 9kg in the coming year.

'It's an unreal experience getting in there and grabbing her by the head and restraining her with the team working together,' he said.

'We put her on a bit of diet over the last 12 months so we dropped her back from 12 goats down to six and we pulled 11kg off her. 

'The weight we got out of her is perfect which means we've got a very healthy snake.

'We want to get her down to 120kg... so knock her back to about eight goats for the next 12 months.'

Atomic Betty, 15-years-old, and is expected to live up to 30 years in captivity.

According to the reptile park, in the wild her life span would be shorter but her species could grow up to eight metres long.
