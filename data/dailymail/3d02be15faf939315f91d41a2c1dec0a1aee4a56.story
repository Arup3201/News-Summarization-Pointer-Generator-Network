Ander Herrera has vowed he 'will not stop' until he achieves his dream of winning trophies with Manchester United.

The 25-year-old was named the fans' Player of the Month for February - receiving 76 per cent of votes in an online poll to see of Marcos Rojo (second) and Chris Smalling (third) - after goal scoring displays against Preston and Swansea.

Speaking to MUTV, Herrera said: 'This means a lot for me because the votes came from our fans and I'm very happy and grateful to them.

'I think they value my work and my passion for playing and I want to try to keep helping the team.

'I was happy [with my form] but I would have been even happier if we had won against Swansea away.

'We won four games last month and now we have to continue that – we are in the top four and we want to be there until the end of the season.'

While the Spanish playmaker has won over supporters, he is yet to convince Louis van Gaal but remains determined to become a success at Old Trafford.

'I think they [the fans] like players who work a lot and who play with passion,' added Herrera.

'They have always shown me affection from the first day and I am very grateful.

'I always say this - I feel very lucky to be a Manchester United player and I will always be the same – I want to try to play with passion, work hard and help the team.

'My dream is to achieve trophies with Manchester United – I will not stop until I achieve that.'
