It may be the UK’s most successful film of all time, but it’s also one of the most error-strewn.

Skyfall has 35 continuity mistakes which means the film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond has come second in a poll of the top ten most gaffe-ridden films of the year.

Top of the list is Men In Black III which had 63 errors.

Error-prone: Daniel Craig as James Bond in 2012's Skyfall. The film contained 35 mistakes despite costing £100million to make

Skyfall's most obvious blunder happened in the opening car chase scene, the jeep that Mr Bond and a female agent are driving crashes. She knocks out the cracked windshield, but later on, the window appears perfectly in place

In third place is the Hollywood action film The Amazing Spider-Man, followed by The Avengers in fourth.

Last night film critic Barry Norman said: ‘If you analyse the number of continuity errors it’s astonishing how many mistakes seem to go under the radar but there’s no accounting for human error’.

But Mr Norman, 79, said continuity errors do not hinder the enjoyment of the film.

He said: ‘I never really noticed these so called bloopers and I’ve been watching films ever since I can remember.

'To be honest I think the people who pick these things out have far too much time on their hands’.

Error-strewn: The third film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy The Dark Knight Rises had 24 mistakes in it

Also on the list is the multi-million pound film franchise The Hunger Games, as well as the final instalment in the Batman series: The Dark Knight Rises.

The top ten films with the most mistakes in 2012:

1. Men In Black III (63)

2. Skyfall (35)

3. Batman: The Dark Knight Rises (24)

4. The Amazing Spiderman (24)

5. The Avengers (22)

6. Looper (14)

7. Prometheus (13)

8. Argo (13)

9. Underworld: Awakening (10)

10. The Hunger Games (10)

The errors have been compiled by moviemistakes.com, a website which encourages fans to email in and point out the blunders they notice.

Earlier this week it was revealed Skyfall is the first film to take £100million at the UK box office.

It is still on general release more than two months after it first hit Britain’s cinemas.

And although Skyfall had a budget of more than £100million, it appears not enough of the cash went into the editing and continuity.

The most obvious blunder happened in the opening car chase scene, the jeep that Mr Bond and a female agent are driving crashes. She knocks out the cracked windshield, but later on, the window appears perfectly in place.

Another error involves Bond’s black lace-up shoes morphing seamlessly into ankle boots while he battles an assassin aboard a moving train.

And another mistake involves Mr Craig’s co-star Dame Judi Dench who plays Bond’s boss M in the film.

When Bond meets with M in her office, M - who is silhouetted from behind - is wearing one dangling earring and one clip on earring. When the shot moves to a side view, M has two clip on earrings.

In the action film Men in Black III, which took £624 million worldwide, a little alien sneaks inside the character Boris’s hand, and at one point his fingers are stretched out in one shot, yet bent a frame later.

In another sequence when the character ‘J’ is trapped by the Chinese alien’s tongue, a red napkin magically appears on the counter.

Film: The Amazing Spiderman (2012) with Andrew Garfield in the lead roll came joint third with 24 mistakes

Third on the list is the Hollywood action adventure The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of the popular comic book series.

It had a budget of more than £230million, and grossed in excess of £700million at the box office worldwide.

But fans pointed out 24 mistakes in the continuity.

In one scene when fighting against the character Lizard in the lab, Peter’s jacket changes randomly from spotless, to covered in dust, to partially covered in dust.

And in another scene when Lizard confronts Peter by the lockers, a girl with a blue striped sweater runs by twice between shots.

Other films to make the top ten include the final instalment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, which has 24 errors, and The Hunger Games with a total of 10.

Gaffes: The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) was tenth on the list with 10 mistakes
