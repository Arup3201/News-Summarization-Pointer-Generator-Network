These heartbreaking pictures show the innocent baby left behind after its mother and two siblings were brutally murdered.

The six-month-old boy is completely unaware of the horror unfolding around him as officers carry him away from a scene of violence that shocked even the police.

The children's father sat dazed in front of the house near Sacramento, California, still reeling after making the gruesome discovery while the baby boy was cradled by police officers.

Tender moment: An officer holds the child with care after it was found unharmed but crying in the same house as its murdered mother and two siblings

On call: The police deputy held the six-month-old boy until a social worker arrived in the early evening

Because of the ongoing investigation, the child was held by a police deputy until a social services worker arrived on the scene in the early evening.

Suspect: Grigoriy Bukhantsov, the victim's brother-in-law and uncle to the two slain children, was brought in for questioning Wednesday morning

'Many of us have children as well. It's extremely traumatic… We're all human,' County Sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Jason Ramos told the Sacramento Bee.

Police have since caught the suspect, Grigoriy Bukhantsov, the brother of the children's father, and in turn the brother-in-law and uncle of the victims.

'We had developed information pretty early and the investigation caused us to focus on him,' Sergeant Ramos told MailOnline. 

He was arrested at a Denny's restaurant after police spotted the car he had stolen from his victims' house.

'Inside the restaurant, officers contacted 19 year-old Grigoriy Bukhantsov, who was identified as the brother-in-law to the female adult victim and uncle to the victim children. Bukhantsov was detained without incident,' police said in the press release.

The 19-year-old 'had a very strained relationship with several members of the family.' Investigators are still searching for the motive.

Grigoriy was taken into police custody Wednesday morning for questioning over the murder of his sister-in-law Alina Bukhantsov and two of her three children, whose names have not been released.

Discovery: Denis is thought to be a student and he found his dead family members when he arrived home Tuesday afternoon. He was the one to notify police

Police said that the bodies of the 
three victims were all found in the same vicinity, while the surviving 
baby was found in a rear bedroom of the house further away from the 
scene.

The first clue that the murderer was 
someone known to the family was the there were no signs of forced entry,
leading investigators to believe that Alina knew her killer.

Victim: Alina Bukhantsov (right) was killed in her home on Tuesday, and is seen here with one of her three children though it is unclear which

When her husband Denis arrived at the
home 
from school, he went inside and realized that something was wrong. He 
then rushed to a neighbors house because he did not know if the intruder
was still in the house.

Officers
found the 'extremely distraught' man in front of his home while the 
six-month-old infant lay crying in a crib in a room at the back.

The mother, who was in her 20s, her three-year-old girl and her two-year-old boy suffered 'a lot of trauma' prior to their death, according to Sergeant Ramos.

The family is from the Ukraine and it
is unclear how long they have lived in America, but they have 
definitely been here for several years.

A
neighbor told The Sacramento Bee that she had gone to high school with 
Alina, saying that she was shocked by the scene because the family 
'didn't look like trouble people'.

Sergeant Ramos
would not reveal the details of the death but the father and neighbour 
were detained for questioning, although they have not been identified as
suspects.

'This is 
somebody who confronted a family inside their homes and took their lives
very violently. It's shocking, even to veteran law enforcement,' he 
said.

The
crime scene was so shocking that chaplains were called to comfort the 
first responders who were shaken by the extent of the violence.

Authorities are questioning the family's neighbors in Rancho Cordova, 15 miles east of Sacramento.

They are also asking the public for help look for the family's white 2005 Chrysler Town and Country minivan with the licence plate number 6LFY276, which police say was stolen from the home. 

By early evening, police and television 
reporters filled the block of ranch-style houses around the corner from 
an elementary school.

Several reporters said that officers exiting the home were visibly shaken.

Sgt Ramos said officers 'rarely see' a crime of this magnitude.

'We're looking into everything; we have a mom and two kids dead,' he said.

The family was said to be religious, and neighbor Sandra Sida said that she frequently saw them dressed up for church.

'I've never seen them angry,' she said.
