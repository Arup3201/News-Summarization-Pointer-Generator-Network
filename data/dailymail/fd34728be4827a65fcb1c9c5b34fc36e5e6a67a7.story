A new ‘smart’ drug for breast cancer extends women’s lives by six months while reducing toxic side effects including hair loss.

Campaigners claim the drug offers a ‘precious lifeline’ for women with the most aggressive form of the disease, who have tried other treatments.

Known as T-DM1, it combines the ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent.

Lifeline: Emma Barnes is trialling the new treatment in Manchester after Herceptin stopped working. It has stopped any new secondary tumours

T-DM1 is designed to seek out and destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage.

Results
 from a major trial show the drug prolonged the lives of patients with 
advanced HER2-positive breast cancer by 30.9 months compared with 25.1 
months on standard therapy.

Patients on T-DM1 had fewer, less severe 
side effects and reported a better quality of life.

The
 results were released yesterday at the European Society for Medical 
Oncology in Vienna, Austria.

Around 10,000 British women have HER-2 
positive breast cancer diagnosed each year – about one in five of those 
affected.

Paul Ellis, 
professor of cancer medicine at King’s College London, said the trial 
results were remarkable in patients with advanced  disease who had 
relapsed on existing treatment.

‘HER-2
 positive breast cancer is very aggressive and once it progresses to the
 “advanced” stage it becomes very difficult to treat,’ he said.

‘These 
results are truly outstanding and will positively alter the outlook and 
outcomes for patients.’

Professor
 Ellis said the drug was possibly the biggest advance since Herceptin 
was licensed for use in 2000.

‘T-DM1 contains an extremely potent form 
of chemotherapy that’s been around 20 years which we haven’t been able 
to use before because it’s so toxic,’ he said.

‘Clever
 new technology has allowed these two older drugs to be linked so that 
the chemotherapy  is not released until it reaches  the target.

‘Drugs
 used at this stage of the disease often make women feel worse, but the 
beauty of this treatment is that it costs women fewer side effects such 
as hair loss and improves their quality of life.’

Breast cancer screening can catch the disease early. But some forms are aggressive and resistant to treatment. Now a new drug could provide a lifeline

The
 international trial recruited 991 patients, including mother-of-two 
Emma Barnes, 36, who has been battling HER-2 positive breast cancer for 
nine years.

She joined the 
trial in May 2010 at the Christie Hospital Manchester after developing a
 liver tumour and has been having infusions of T-DM1 every three weeks.

Although she became resistant to Herceptin after five years of 
treatment, the new drug has stopped any new secondary tumours.

Breast cancer rates have increased by 90 per cent in the last four decades, figures suggest.

In 1971, there were 66 cases for every 100,000 women in England but by 2010 the rate had soared to 126 per 100,000, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest.

But the number of women dying from the disease has steadily declined since screening was introduced in 1987.

Charity Breast Cancer UK called on the Government to take action to reduce exposure to cancer-causing chemicals.

Clare Dimmer, chair of Breast Cancer UK, said: 'This shocking increase in breast cancer rates over just one generation underlines how vital it is that all the root causes of breast cancer are fully explored.

'Whilst death rates from breast cancer have thankfully decreased, still more and more of us are getting the disease. This epidemic is clearly not down to genetics and lifestyle choices alone.

'Breast Cancer UK calls on the Government to finally start tackling the growing health risk associated with our exposure to hazardous chemicals, such as Bisphenol A, that have been scientifically linked to breast cancer as well as many other diseases, and to take action to ban them.'

The ONS said that in 2010, 41,259 new cases were diagnosed, 731 more than 2009.

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in English women and in 2011 more than 9,700 women died from the disease.

‘I’m
 doing most things that I want to do,’ she said.

‘My husband Garry has 
been amazing, and the children, but I think the drug’s been fantastic.’

She
 has experienced minor side effects but says it’s worth it. ‘I’ve got no
 evidence of disease at the moment,’ she added.

‘I hope that every woman
 who needs this drug will eventually be able to get it.’

T-DM1
 seeks out and destroys cancerous cells in a two-stage attack. It 
attaches to the tumour cell and blocks signals that encourage the cancer
 to spread.

Then it 
breaches the outer defences and releases chemotherapy to destroy it from
 within. This spares healthy tissue from unnecessary damage.

The
 cancer’s return is also delayed and side effects from chemotherapy such
 as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced.

Professor
 Ellis, who also works at Guy’s Hospital, London, said around 1,000 
women a year would benefit from the drug in the UK after relapsing.

But
 eventually it might be used before the disease spread possibly 
replacing current treatment using Herceptin and chemotherapy as separate
 agents.

It was possible the technology could be effective in treating 
other types of tumour.

The 
drug’s manufacturer, Roche, is applying for a licence in Europe, which 
could mean it is available for patients before the end of 2013. The 
price is not yet known.

Baroness
 Morgan, chief executive of the research charity Breast  Cancer 
Campaign, said: ‘This “smart” drug could be a precious lifeline for 
women with HER2- positive advanced breast cancer who currently have 
limited treatment options. We hope it will be made available to women as
 early as possible.’

Carolyn
 Rogers, senior clinical nurse specialist at another charity, Breast 
Cancer Care, said: ‘The trial evaluates a new way of combining 
chemotherapy and targeted therapy in one agent which could help delay 
the progression of secondary breast cancer as well as reduce the 
likelihood of some of the very unpleasant side effects that are 
associated with chemotherapy.’
