Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has revealed his dream five-a-side line-up, choosing from all the players he has played alongside at club and international level.

He selected Tottenham and France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to go between the sticks, with only Ledley King for protection.

Steven Gerrard and Luka Modric make up a tasty two-man midfield while Defoe chose himself to lead the line in attack.

Striker: Jermain Defoe 

'Hugo, for me, is unbelievable,' Lloris said to Sunderland's in house television channel. 'I'd have Ledley King (in defence). In fact Ledley King could play at the back on his own because he can do everything. He doesn't even tackle because his positioning is unbelievable, he just reads the game.

'Steven Gerrard because it is Steven Gerrard, basically. Good finisher, just hits shots.'

Defoe raved about Modric's ability in five-a-side. 

Luka Modric was chosen by Defoe to become Gerrard's partner in midfield

Defoe said he would choose himself to play in attack so he could score the goals

'In my time at Tottenham with Luka, he was just unbelievable. Small, a low centre of gravity, sharp and never gave the ball away.

'I'm just going to stand up front, not really move and just finish it!'
