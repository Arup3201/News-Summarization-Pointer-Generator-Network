Three women were arrested after twerking at an impromptu dance party in the Beaverton City Hall parking lot.

Police say Coura Valazquez, 20, of Vancouver, Washington went to municipal court with two friends Brittany Medak, 20, of Vancouver, Washington and Leokham Yothsombath, 22, of Portland, Oregon on Monday afternoon to pay a fine. The show began as they headed to the parking lot.

Police say Medak lifted up her skirt and urinated between two cars in the parking lot as Yothsombath filmed the event, reports The New York Daily News.
