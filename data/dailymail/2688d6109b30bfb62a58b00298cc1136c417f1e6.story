Roy Keane has made the shocking revelation that he had an 'evil thought' because he felt 'glad' Clive Clarke's heart attack happened on the same night as Sunderland were knocked out the League Cup by Luton Town.

Clarke was on loan from Sunderland at Leicester City when he suffered a cardiac arrest in the changing rooms during a match against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground in August 2007, causing the tie to be abandoned at half-time.

The left back fell ill on the same evening Premier League side Sunderland - managed at the time by Keane - were humbled 3-0 at League One Luton.

The former Manchester United midfielder says the incident helped 'deflect' attention from their result

Position: Left-back

Born: Dublin, Republic of Ireland

Clubs: Stoke City (1999-2005), West Ham United (2005-06), Sunderland (2006-08), Coventry City (2006), Leicester City (2007)

Career Appearances: 285

Career Goals: 10 

Ireland caps: 2  

And Keane reveals in his autobiography, The Second Half, that he was relieved the incident happened that evening because it distracted from Sunderland's display.

He writes: 'I had the evil thought: "I'm glad he had it tonight" because it would deflect our woeful performance.'

Keane also concedes that, having once joked that he was surprised ‘they’d found a heart’, he ‘sometimes forgot’ he ‘wasn’t the only person with parents and children’. 

Clarke enjoyed a nine-year football career before being forced to retire due to medical advice in February 2008 following his heart attack.

He started his career at Stoke City in 1999, making 223 league appearances, before spending a season with West Ham United between 2005 and 2006.

A move to Sunderland in 2006 was followed by loans to Coventry City and then Leicester. 

The left back became a football agent after retiring from the game due to medical advice in February 2008 at the age of just 27.

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'
