Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises

A Perth court has heard Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell sat in a hot car, drinking beer and listening to music while the injured 10-month-old baby lay on the floor.

The 27-year-old man faces charges of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby boy for 15 hours in March last year, but Mr Bell claims it was when he took the child into the Fortescue River to cool off that the 10-month-old drowned.

He told the Perth court the he 'never would have harmed' the child because he 'was looking after him'.

Mr Bell is also accused of inflicting third-degree burns and bruises on the baby but the accused maintained his innocence and said the baby's injuries were caused from falling naked from the moving car after the passenger door opened while driving through a roundabout in Broome.

Mr Bell, who knew the child's mother, said he panicked and was upset seeing the child covered in dirt.

'I was crying because he had fallen out of the car,' Bell testified.

He told the court the boy had grazing and bruises on his head so he cradled him against his chest, but did not take the 10-month-old baby to a hospital.

'He wasn't moving when I picked him up ... he was sobbing and crying,' Bell said.

'I was in a hysterical state of mind at the time he fell out of the car.

'To me he didn't seem to need any help.'

Mr Bell told the court he drank beer and listened to music, moments before the baby drowned.

He said the child was left on the floor of the hot car, and Mr Bell bought cigarettes, flavoured milk and oranges.

While at a swimming spot, Mr Bell said he went under water for 20 seconds and then felt a kick to his leg, and when he came up, he found the baby head-first in the water.

While testifying, Mr Bell admitted to West Australian Supreme Court he drank and listened to music while the baby lay on the floor of his hot car

Water came out of the child's mouth and Mr Bell, who was in shock, performed CPR before driving to a road-house.

'It was like he was choking,' Bell said.'I pumped on his chest a couple of times.'

'He just wouldn't breathe.'

'It just happened so fast,' he repeatedly said.

'It's a very sad incident what happened, but just got to deal with it,' Bell said.

On Thursday, Mr Bell told the court he did not think the mother took care of her baby and admitted the pair argued the evening before the baby died.

He said the altercation began when the woman humiliated and slapped him.

'I may have assaulted her. I'm not 100 per cent sure,' he said.

Mr Bell said he tore off her clothes but denies trying to run her over in his car.

'I wanted to humiliate her,' he testified.

The judge-alone trial is expected to resume on Tuesday, when the defence will be concluding its evidence.
