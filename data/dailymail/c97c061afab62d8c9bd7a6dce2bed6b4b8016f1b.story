A 23-year-old woman claims she was dragged by her hair, punched, and stomped on by her 'best friends' after they accused her of sitting on someone's hamburger during a drinking game.

In cell phone video of the beating, girls can be seen viciously pummeling Myriah Pointer, 23, of Atlanta, Georgia until she is knocked unconscious.

'I was held down and stomped until I was unconscious. Once I gained consciousness they were still beating and stomping me,' Pointer posted on Facebook. She also included pictures showing her bruised eyes and battered face and body.

Beaten: Myriah Pointer, 23, was beaten because she supposedly sat on her best friend's hamburger 

'I’m more hurt emotionally than physically,' Pointer told WSBTV.

'I was unconscious while they were beating me.'

'By someone you called your best friend,' Pointer continued. ‘It was about a burger.'

Pointer explained that she was with friends and one of her cousins on Saturday when one of the women accused her of sitting on her Whopper.

'Like, the wrapper of the burger,' Pointer said.

Painful: Now bruised and emotionally wounded, Pointer says she wants to seek justice for her attackers 

'Like, I didn’t even sit on her burger.'

The New York Daily News reports that witnessing it was a boyfriend of one of her attackers, who filmed the assault. 

One woman's 3-year-old daughter was also present.

Battered and bruised, Pointer claims she was held by her friends for three hours until they let her call her aunt to pick her up.

'I am BLESSED to be alive and I need justice to be served because I DID NOT deserve this,' she wrote while accusing Atlanta police of not 'taking this as serious as it is.'

Police say they're investigating and that charges 'will be forthcoming.'

Injured: After the beating, Myriah Pointer is a far cry from her usually glamorous self
