Once it housed nuclear missiles. Now a 50ft Cold War era bomb silo has been converted into a luxury property by a pair of ambitious developers and has been put up for sale with a hefty Â£2million price tag.

The New York State home, which boasts a runway for a private jet, hangar and spacious living quarters, looks like an innocuous log cabin at ground level but conceals a vast silo and missile launch control centre beneath.

The silo, which is reinforced and was designed to withstand a direct hit from a nuclear bomb, has now been turned into a two-level residence, with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and an open living area and kitchen.

Innocuous: From the surface, the silo home looks like any other log cabin, albeit one with its own private runway, but it's a different story in the launch centre below

Ready for lift off! The vast silo rooms beneath the cabin once housed nuclear missiles and also contained a Cold War era missile launch centre

Launchpad: The home - and the 50ft silo below - 
once contained missiles similar to this one but was converted by

The property was developed by Bruce James Franscio and his partner Gregory Gibbons and is located in the picturesque Adirondack State Park near Lake Placid, the site of the 1980 Winter Olympic Games, in Essex County.

Franscio, a former pilot, said: 'Once you're inside its great to say hey, let's check out the basement, hit a code and then enter a 50ft tunnel which takes you to where the missile was.'

Franscio bought the missile silo with Gibbons in the early 1990s, after it had spent 30 years underwater and needed cleaning and renovating.

'There are so many possibilities for the Silohome,' added Franscio. 'It would be great for yoga retreats, business conferences or for a community purpose, as well as an amazing home.'

'I think it would ideally suited to be a community base, as there are plenty of outdoor activities to do in the park like cycling and walking.

'I am attached the the Silohome as we spent so long working on it, but I would like to see it put to good use.'

Spacious: The upper floor contains a luxury open-plan living area, complete with a granite work top and stunning views of the surrounding Adirondack State Park

Bunker: A door in the kitchen leads to a staircase down to the missile storage area where you need to enter a code to get past the reinforced metal door (right)

Cold War: The vast bunker doors were intended to withstand a nuclear attack - enabling the American technicians within to hit back at aggressors if necessary

Reinforced: The huge underground silotube was designed to take a direct nuclear strike and once housed nuclear armaments within

Hidden away: From the outside, the neat log cabin home looks much like any other house and is surrounded by the beautiful Adirondack State Park

Clue: While the innocuous house doesn't give much away, the adjoining runway and hangar hint at the building's former military use

Historic: The silotube is remarkably well preserved, despite having spent 30 years underwater. Right: A plan of the subterranean part of the Silohome

Development: Bruce James Franscio and his wife Kelly say the converted property would make a fabulous home or could do double service as a community centre

Silo with a view: The isolated property boasts spectacular views of the gorgeous Adirondack State Park which is near Lake Placid in Essex County, upstate New York
