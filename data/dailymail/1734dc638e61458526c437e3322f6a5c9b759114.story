Tragic: Boxer Lewis Pinto sent his girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck hours before hanging himself

A professional boxer sent his girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck hours before hanging himself.

Lewis Pinto, 24, was found hanging from a tree in a park near his south London home by a dog walker, an inquest heard.

The night before his body was discovered in June this year, Lewis had an argument with his girlfriend Natalie Lomas, 20.

Croydon Coroner's court heard how Lewis had gone to meet Natalie who was on a night out with friends.

However, after having an argument the pair went their separate ways.

Between 3am and 3.30am the couple exchanged a series of phone calls and text messages.

Coroner Dr Roy Palmer told the inquest that in one message the super middleweight prospect wrote: ‘Goodnight and goodbye’, followed by a picture of himself with a noose around his neck.

Dr Palmer said: 'Lewis was speaking to Miss Lomas between 3am and 3.30am on the phone and through text messages.

'He sent her a picture of himself with a blue noose around his neck. Another of his texts said he was driving to Beddington Park.'

After receiving the message he was heading to Beddington Park to kill himself, Natalie frantically contacted the police to alert them.

But after searching the park and the surrounding area police could not find him.

Tragically Lewis had led them on a 'false trail' and had instead gone to Roundshaw Park in Wallington, near Croydon.

Lewis was unbeaten as a pro after initially making his name on the unlicenced boxing scene.

The inquest was told he had a long history of depression and that he had threatened to kill himself a number of times.

In March 2008 Pinto was treated in hospital for an infected wound to his stomach after he had stabbed himself in an apparent suicide bid.

He told doctors that he did it because he was upset after just splitting up with his girlfriend of three years.

He was started on a course of anti-depressants and was offered counselling which he did not accept.

Throughout 2011 Lewis told doctors he was feeling suicidal, the hearing was told.

In August he was rushed to St Helier’s Hospital in south London after taking a drug overdose and the following month he told psychiatrists he had planned to hang himself, but couldn’t go through with it.

Doctors put his behaviour down to an 'immature personality' rather than 'cries for help'.

The talented boxer, who lived on the Roundshaw Estate in Wallington, Surrey, made his professional debut in April this year and was tipped to rise to the top in the sport.

His body was found in the wooded area of Roundshaw Park in Wallington on June 3rd just after 8am.

A dog walker made the terrible discovery as she took her dog on an early morning walk.

Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene.

Dr Palmer told the court that the cause of death was suicide.

Recording a verdict of suicide, Dr Palmer said: 'Taking in the totality of the evidence, I conclude that Lewis did mean to take his life.

'It was an impulsive act, but I am sure he meant to end his life that night.

'He set a false trail, so although his girlfriend and the police did all possible to try and find him he went somewhere else.'

Natalie, who had been in a relationship with Lewis for 18 months, attended the inquest with her mother.

Speaking to Natalie, Dr Palmer said: 'I am very sorry you lost your boyfriend in such sad circumstances. You did everything you could to fix the situation.'

Lewis’ family were not present at the inquest.
