Gone are the days when busy users had to choose between following their Twitter feeds and watching their favorite TV shows – now they will be able to do both simultaneously.

Twitter and Comcast have signed a partnership that will let viewers access TV shows using a new remote control feature and buy movie tickets directly from a tweet, deepening the short messaging service’s ties to television programming.

The two companies announced today that a new feature that is part of the deal will let customers of Comcast’s Xfinify TV service tune in to programs by clicking a ‘See It’ button in a tweet. The button will begin appearing in tweets next month.

Clicker of tomorrow: Twitter and Comcast 
teamed up to create the 'See It' button that will be appearing in tweets
about shows and allowing users to tune in live or set a DVR recording

The feature enables viewers to tune in to a live or On Demand show like Sunday Night Football or the hit reality show ‘The Voice’ through their set-top box or mobile device.

In a statement, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts called it ‘an instant online remote control.’

The button will allow Twitter users who are also Comcast customers to set recordings on their DVRs, tune in to shows like The Voice online, on TV or on mobile devices directly through a tweet.

Twitter users who do not subscribe to Comcast will be redirected to NBC's website or app to watch  shows there.

They can also purchase mobile movie tickets through Fandango.

In the current TV season, shows on NBC, USA, Bravo, MSNBC and other networks will be accessible through the ‘See It’ button.

Comcast and Twitter said they are in talks with other TV networks and companies that will use the feature in the coming months. The hope is the ‘See It’ button will become as ubiquitous as the Facebook ‘like.’

Media companies will also have a better sense of how to target Twitter efforts since they will be armed with aggregate data of people watching programs.

‘We will know how many of those tweets generate consumption back on TV,’ said Sam Schwartz, Comcast chief business development officer.

Twitter’s deal with the nation’s 
largest cable company comes as the social media giant prepares for an 
IPO of stock, which could occur as soon as next month.

The
140-character messaging platform is setting its sights on grabbing a 
piece of the TV advertising market - the first stop for brands that 
spend billions of dollars a year for TV commercials.

The
agreement is more expansive than the advertising partnerships Twitter 
has signed recently with TV content providers such as CBS and the NFL. 
But it does have an advertising component, which adds NBCUniversal’s 
properties to Twitter’s Amplify program.

Amplify lets TV content owners beam real-time video clips to Twitter users who may have seen —or could be interested in — their programming.

It also allows marketers to communicate with viewers who saw their TV ads, extending commercial pitches to consumers’ smartphones and tablets.

‘Twitter is where television viewers come to talk about what they’re watching on TV when they’re watching it,’ Dick Costolo, Twitter’s CEO, said in a statement.

‘Millions of users are exposed to the live conversation that unfolds on Twitter while a show is on the air and now, with See It, they’ll be able to tune in directly from a Tweet.’
