This is the moment a brave grandmother chased a thief with a mop and bucket after he stole cash from her handbag.

Yvonne Carey picked up the cleaning equipment and ran after the criminal, who had sneaked into her social club to steal from members.

CCTV shows the thief running for his life from the club before Mrs Carey, clutching the mop she was using to clean the floor, appears and pursues him.

The 58-year says she was disappointed not to catch the man, who made off with £200 after the incident at Our Lady Queen of Peace club in Litherland, Merseyside.

Grandmother Yvonne Carey armed herself with a mop and bucket and chased a thief from the Our Lady Queen of Peace club in Litherland, Merseyside

The hooded thief had targeted the social club and Mrs Carey spotted him rifling through her handbag

Mrs Carey said: 'I just saw him going through my bag so I shouted at him. I had the mop and bucket in my hand and he started to run away so I chased after him.

'I was desperate to catch him so I kept screaming and yelling at him to stop. Sadly he was too quick.

'Maybe if I'd have chucked the mop and bucket away I'd have caught up with him.

'I didn't think about it at the time but he could have had a weapon like a gun or a knife on him - but I was just desperate to catch him.'

Her friend, Dee Grey, was at the club organising a weight watchers class and chased the thief down a pathway but he managed to flee the scene.

Mrs Carey revealed she had been saving up for a family holiday in Florida for seven years and planned to use the cash to buy dollars.

Despite the theft, grandmother-of-two Yvonne is still determined to enjoy her holiday in 10 days time with her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.

She said: 'We've been saving up to go away for seven years now so there's no way I'm going to let a thief like him ruin our family holiday.

'I just hope the police can find out who did it and bring him to justice.'

The offender, described as white, in his 30s and of slight build, was caught on camera walking around the social club before going inside and raiding the grandmother's bag.

He was wearing dark tracksuit bottoms, a grey coloured top and sunglasses at the time of the theft.

A spokesperson for Merseyside Police confirmed they were appealing for information about the theft on July 15 after officers had combed the scene.
