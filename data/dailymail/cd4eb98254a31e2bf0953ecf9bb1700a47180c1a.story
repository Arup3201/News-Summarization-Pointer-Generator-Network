The red squirrel faces extinction in the next two decades as its population has dropped by half in the past 50 years, warn researchers.

Efforts through wildlife biodiversity action plans to save British mammals have failed to halt the decline in numbers of red squirrels, as well as hedgehogs, Scottish wildcats and dormice.

Red squirrel populations have been hit by invasive grey squirrels, which compete with reds for food and carry a disease which is fatal to their native cousins.

And wildlife experts think the animals will soon be confined to remote areas of Britain such as the Scottish Highlands.

Under threat: The population of red squirrels has fallen by half in the past 50 years, according to experts

According to a Oxford University report,
numbers of UK hedgehogs have dwindled to about 1.5million, compared 
with 30million in the 1950s.

A report by the university's wildlife conservation unit for the People's Trust for Endangered Species states that the common dormouse and mountain hare are also under threat, despite the efforts of nationwide biodiversity action plans.

The State of Britain's Mammals study claims that seven mammal species whose conservation was given priority status were still declining last year.

The report states: 'Although many of Britain's mammals apparently declined significantly in the past 25 years, some appear to have stabilised or even increased in the last decade,' the report states.

'Of the 25 monitored mammal species native to Britain, half are stable (not necessarily in a good state) or increasing.'

Despite the largely negative news from the report, there was some encouragement from the fact that the populations of bats, otters and water voles has increased.

Otters in particular have benefited 
from cleaner rivers in Britain, following a ban on chemicals used in 
sheep dip in the late 1990s.

But a combination of pesticides killing their prey, hedgerow low and other factors has seen the UK's hedgehog numbers plummet.

The
omens for the red squirrel have also not been helped by the discovery 
in Scotland in 2005 of the squirrel pox virus, carried by grey 
squirrels.

The disease had previously been confined to England, where it has been one of the causes of the huge reduction in the number of red squirrels.

David Macdonald, one of the report's authors, warned: 'We expect the future of red squirrels to be confined to a few islands, such as Anglesey and the Isle of Wight, or in the Highlands of Scotland.'

He and co-author Dawn Burnham added: 'The last 15 years 
have seen some successes, particularly recovery of some rare species.

'However, with the ongoing decline of
once common species, like hedgehogs, it is widely accepted that targets
for the Convention on Biological Diversity, for 2010, were missed.

'In
general, progress has been better for species restricted in range that 
could benefit from targeted, site-based, conservation efforts.

'There's been less progress on targets for habitats and many widespread species.'

Dying out: The hedgehog is now on the list of the 10 most endangered species in Britain

As well as 'holding the line' by taking steps to protect threatened mammals, the authors suggest radical conservation efforts including bringing back once-native species, such as beavers and even the Eurasian lynx, to the UK.

'We should be thinking about beaver reintroductions in Wales and England in the course of the immediate future,' Professor Macdonald said.

He has also floated the idea of more radical interventions to help Britain's wildlife, including taking large areas out of agriculture for 're-wilding' and fenced and unfenced nature reserves.

An environmental survey last month named red squirrels, hedgehogs, the brown hare and the Scottish wildcat in Britain's top 10 endangered species.

The red-necked phalathrope was said to be Britain's most endangered species, while the red squirrel was sixth, and the hedgehog tenth.
