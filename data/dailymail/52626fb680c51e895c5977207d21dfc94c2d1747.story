They say if you don’t ask, you don’t get.

Even so, Jessica Fitch could not quite believe her luck when she – with a little help from her dad – persuaded the Queen to pose for a photograph with her battered old teddy bear, Bertie.

Palace sources said last night that they had never known of anyone to approach the Queen for a photograph, let alone persuade her to pose for one.

But Jessica, aged seven, wasn’t content with one royal photograph – she wanted to make it a hat-trick.

Jessica Fitch, seven, meets the Queen with Bertie the bear

So the brave little girl went up to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and managed to get snaps taken with them, too.

Jessica, from Cheltenham, 
Gloucestershire, was at Buckingham Palace with her parents Michael and 
Heather for the Coronation Festival yesterday.

The event was organised by the Royal Warrant Holders Association in honour of the Queen’s 60 years on the throne.

Jessica, a Brownie, had brought along 
her pack’s mascot, Bertie, so he could enjoy their ‘ big adventure’. 
When she saw the Queen walking past, she decided to seize her chance.

Her 35-year-old father, who works for 
the RAF, described the moment. He said: ‘She held up Bertie towards the 
Queen so I just said without thinking: “Ma’am, would you mind posing for
 a picture with Bertie bear from our Brownie group?”’

Jessica continued: ‘The Queen looked 
at Bertie’s uniform and smiled and asked me : “Are you a Brownie?” Then I
 said, in a very posh voice, “Yes I am”.’

Mr Fitch added: ‘My hands were shaking
 as I knew I had only once chance to get the shot, but I managed it, 
thankfully. Jessica was absolutely fearless.’

Next up was Camilla, who 
was delighted to oblige and even asked to have a little cuddle with 
Bertie. Finally Jessica bumped into Charles, completing her royal 
hat-trick.

In the evening the Queen enjoyed a gala performance of music and dance from throughout her reign.

Guests in the royal box included her 
granddaughter, Zara Phillips, who was making her first public appearance
 since announcing her pregnancy this week.

She concealed any possible signs of an early bump in a loose shift dress with a bold floral pattern.

The Coronation Festival is a celebration of the best of British and leading firms supplying goods to the Royal Family showcased their wares in honour of the coronation’s 60th anniversary.

In glorious summer sunshine the Queen toured the festival organised by the Royal Warrant Holders Association in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.

As well as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall other members of the Royal Family who met exhibitors included Princesses Eugenie and the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

The manicured lawns of the Queen’s 
official residence were covered with pavilions and marquees featuring 
more than 200 brands which have supplied goods or services for at least 
five years to the Households of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh or the 
Prince of Wales.

Around 60,000 visitors are expected to attend the four-day event displaying British 'innovation, excellence and industry'.

Richard Peck, secretary of the Royal 
Warrant Holders Association, said the Queen takes a keen interest in the
 firms supplying her with goods and services.

He said: 'For the royal Warrant 
Holders exhibiting it is the most amazing opportunity, not only because 
of the venue, but they’re getting access to some very key potential 
clients.

The Queen met a number of Royal warrant holders, who must give five years continuous service to the Queen or Royal household before they can be considered for a warrant

'We’ve invited in overseas trade 
missions, diplomats from the main embassies in London, we’re bringing in
 procurement teams from big companies - so it’s going to give them huge 
exposure.'

Mr Peek explained that the festival 
sprung from a successful Christmas fair they staged at the Palace in 
2009 where the Queen enjoyed herself so much she stayed longer than 
expected.

He said: 'She was due to spend half 
an hour at the fair but ended up spending well over two hours despite a 
very busy schedule and she clearly enjoyed it.

'It was really as a result of that 
this has come about, so there’s no doubt she takes a very close interest
 in the businesses and she takes a very close interest how businesses 
are developing.'

The Welsh fashion designer thinks the 87-year-old British
monarch is the "chicest" woman alive today and would be honoured to
design an outfit for her.

He said: "I'd love to dress the Queen. She's one of
the chicest women in the world."

The 42-year-old style guru is known for his bold
personality and is drawn to the royal because he thinks she shares similar
traits.

He added: "She's not shy! She says what she
thinks."

Meow! 'I don't make clothes you wear to the supermarket... I'm not Armani'

Julien has designed several costumes for the English
National Ballet's upcoming royal performance of 'Tempus' - which will be part
of the queen's coronation celebrations to mark her 60th year on the throne -
and he says the regal outfits were inspired by the monarch's London residence,
Buckingham Palace.

He said: "The initial inspiration was the grounds of
the Palace and the embroidery motifs come from the gates, but I've
reinterpreted it in a modern way. It's a combination of old and new."

The designer welcomed the royal task, insisting that he
loves big, bold fashion projects and isn't understated with his garments.

Speaking to the upcoming edition of ES Magazine -
available on July 12 - he said: "I don't make clothes you wear to the
supermarket. I'm not Armani. I'm the king of glamour. I make glitz. In a
Macdonald world, more is more."
