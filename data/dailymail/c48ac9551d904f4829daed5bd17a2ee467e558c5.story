Luis Suarez will train with his Barcelona team-mates on Friday after his ban for biting an opponent at the World Cup was relaxed.

The Court of Arbritration for Sport (CAS) upheld his fourth-month ban from competitive football for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup but eased the conditions which mean Barcelona can officially present him at Nou Camp on Monday, when there will be a huge media presence.

The 27-year-old is also able to play in friendly matches now and he will make his first appearance in Barcelona’s colours when they face Leon FC in the Joan Gampher trophy at Nou Camp the same evening.

Ruling: CAS ruled that Luis Suarez can take part in training and friendly matches but didn't reduce his ban

The Uruguay striker, who moved to Barcelona from Liverpool for £75million last month, had been unable to train with his new team-mates or even set foot inside the Nou Camp under the original terms of suspension.

Suarez had gone to the highest authority in sport, the Court of Arbitration, in an attempt to get them to overturn the punishment that was handed to him by FIFA in the wake of his outrageous behaviour during a Group D game in Natal in June.

His representatives had argued that the punishment was too severe but CAS did not agree and insisted that he serve the suspension. He will miss eight La Liga matches and another three Champions League games. Switzerland-based CAS — an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations — said: ‘The sanctions imposed on the player by FIFA have been generally confirmed.’

Training: The Uruguayan forward has been training on his own since signing for Barcelona 

Suarez, though, now has permission to train with Barcelona after CAS deemed some of the measures taken against him ‘excessive’ and he will link up with his new team-mates for the first time today when manager Luis Enrique puts on a session that is scheduled to start at 9.30am in Barcelona.

Barcelona released a statement yesterday saying: ‘Following the announcement of the verdict by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding the appeal against the sanction imposed on Luis Suarez by FIFA, FC Barcelona hereby announces that the player will join the first team’s training session scheduled for tomorrow Friday at 9.30am in the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper.

‘Likewise, the public presentation of Suarez as a new FC Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou, on occasion of the Joan Gamper Trophy match.’

Incident: Luis Suarez was banned for four months by FIFA after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup

Suarez remains banned for Uruguay’s next eight competitive matches and will miss next year’s Copa America and some World Cup qualifying matches.

Still, the court confirmed he is allowed to play non-competition friendly matches under the terms of FIFA’s disciplinary rules.

Uruguay have friendlies scheduled for September 5 in Japan and September 9 in South Korea and Suarez is eligible to play in those matches.

It is the third time Suarez had been found guilty of biting an opponent in his career.

While he was at Ajax, Suarez bit PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in November 2010, and while at Liverpool he bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013.

Punishment: Although Suarez didn't even receive a booking during the match, he was later banned by FIFA
