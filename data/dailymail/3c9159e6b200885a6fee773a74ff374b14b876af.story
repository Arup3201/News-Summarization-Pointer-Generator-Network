The head of the Royal Air Force has launched a blistering attack on politicians for penny pinching and 'making it up as they go along'.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said military figures wanted 'answers now' but had to deal with civilian leaders who left everything till the last moment and were obsessed with cost.

The comments, which are likely to spark anger in Westminster, came in a speech to a conference organised by the military think-tank the Royal United Services Institute.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said politicians lacked decisiveness and accused them of 'making it up as they go along'

Sir Andrew, Chief of the Air Staff, told the event in London that the RAF's core function was to look after the airspace of British territory - but accused politicians of always wanting to do more with less cash.

'That balance between what the politicians might want me to do and how much they want me to pay for it, and how much time and effort and resource they wish me to invest in it.

'That has always been the way, that balance between politics and the military.'

Sir Andrew went on: 'I am a military man, I want an answer now. The politician - "if I could leave it a couple of days, could you wait till the end of next week, I really don't feel like making a decision just yet. I'll leave it right till the last moment, do I have to make a decision now?"

'I want that decision now... I want to know exactly what you want me to do and I want the end state...

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is unlikely to react kindly to Sir Andrew's remarks

'The politician, he's not really sure what the end state is, he doesn't really care, he's got to be seen to be doing something, "we need to be there, I'll make that up as we go along." That doesn't sit comfortably.'

He said the military were only concerned with whether they had 'enough people and enough equipment to get the job done'.

But he said, for the Government 'the big cruncher' was always 'how much is all this going to cost?'

He added: 'I don't care about the cost. I need the resource, the people to get the job done, get the end state in the timeline.

'We are trying to balance that political ambition with my military ambition, my need to explain to the politicians, if you give me X, I can do Y.'

Senior military figures have repeatedly raised concerns about the impact of the coalition's spending curbs, which have seen force levels cut and equipment programmes trimmed.

An RAF spokesman said: 'The comments made by the Chief of the Air Staff must not be taken out of context. His commentary was based on previous academic discussions at the conference and related to the differences between any international military leader, who has to make decisions based on tactical circumstances and political decision makers who have to take into account a far broader and more complex picture.

'It was certainly not intended as any form of critique of the current UK Government or any previous UK Government.'
