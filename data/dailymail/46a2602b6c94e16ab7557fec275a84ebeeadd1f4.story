An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 shook central southern Mexico on Tuesday, sending terrified workers and residents running into the streets and damaging an estimated 800 homes.

The worst hit area was the town of Iguala, which was close to the epicenter of the quake.

Remarkably, there were no reported fatalities and only 9 serious injuries in spite of the fact that the country was rocked by 18 aftershocks in the hours following the massive earthquake.

The southern border city of Oaxaca 
was significantly closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, and Malia 
Obama was staying in the town with a dozen other American students on a 
school trip.

Ruins: Residents stand amid a damaged house in Ometepec after the 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck southwest Mexico, causing residents in the capital several hundred miles away to rush out onto the streets

Rescue workers: A patient in a wheelchair is attended to by a nurse at a makeshift emergency room after being evacuated from a hospital damaged by the disaster

Fleeing danger: Hundreds pour onto the streets after the earthquake hit land

Safe: Malia, seen here with her mother Michelle Obama, is on a school trip in Oaxaca, Mexico which is near the epicenter of Tuesday's earthquake

The president's eldest daughter is safe and out of harm's way, according to a statement from the White House.

MailOnline, along with a number of publications, was aware of Malia's trip to Mexico before the earthquake hit, but chose not to publicize it at the request of the White House.

Following Tuesday's earthquake, the White House released a statement saying that she 'is safe and was never in danger.'

Though they typically request that the privacy of the teenage girl is protected when she is not with her parents or there is no inherent news interest, they decided to break their privacy streak to reassure that the first daughter is fine after the earthquake.

What remains: A man chips away at the remnants of a wall at his house that was damaged by an earthquake on Tuesday in Ometepec in the Mexican state of Guerrero on Tuesday

The brave: Workers put out a fire after evacuating buildings

Coping: Patients evacuated from a damaged hospital wait for care in a makeshift ER

Medical emergency: Patients evacuated from the hospital lie in beds for rows as nurses attend to them in the outdoors

In more populated areas, like nearby 
Oaxaca and Mexico City which is further away, terrified workers fled the
swaying buildings as plaster crashed to the pavement and windows broke.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the 'strong, long' tremors reached 7.4 on the Richter scale. 

The epicenter of the quake was 15 miles (25km) east of Ometepec in Guerrero state, near the Pacific 
Coast resort of Acapulco.

Earthquakes happen frequently in Mexico, and the country has registered 15 above a 7-magnitude since 1973.

Panicked: A terrified woman falls to her knees as office workers run into the streets

Part of the reason why Tuesday's earthquake did not prove more disasterous is because each of the weak buildings that collapsed in the prior 15 earthquakes were rebuilt stronger.

Panicked residents screamed in fear as they were evacuated from buildings across the city just after midday.

Damage: The quake caused a portion of a bridge to collapse on top of this bus but no word yet if there were any injuries

Lucky: Miraculously, the passengers and driver of the bus that was damaged by the bridge escaped alive

Responding to the scene: Firefighters worked to move the bridge debris

One
Mexico City resident, Imogen Dashwood, told MailOnline: ‘It was very 
scary, I was in my apartment and I didn’t know if it was best to try and
run down the stairs to get outside or hide under the table.

‘In
the end I hid under the table but it was probably not the smartest 
thing to do as it seems all the offices around here were evacuated to 
outside, there are still a lot of people outside now,' the 30-year-old 
said.

‘My apartment building in Polanco was
shaking and swaying for about five minutes and kept moving even after 
the earthquake had stopped.'

Location: The 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Ometepec at 12.02pm local time

Injuries: This woman was being treated by Red Cross representatives following the repercussions felt in Mexico City

Aghast: Shocked city dwellers stared in horror in the roads and traffic ground to a halt in the capital

Telephone lines went down and traffic 
ground to halt in the capital just moments after the quake, but there is
still mass confusion throughout the city. 

Though the magnitude of the earthquake- 7.4 according to the U.S. Geological Survey- was extremely high, there was relatively little severe damage and no known fatalities.

One of the main reasons why is that the earthquake struck very deep into the ground.

It hit 12.4 miles (20 km) below the surface, which helped to mute the tremor before it got to ground and reverberated among buildings.

It also helped that the epicenter was far enough away from major cities.

Because it was closest to Oaxaca (the country's 10th biggest state by population) the damage was lessened due to a lack of closely-knit buildings.

By comparison, the deadly earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010 was registered as 7.0 on the Richter scale, but was much nearer the capital city and only 8.1 miles (13 km) below ground.

‘The phone lines are now down but the internet seems to still be working,’ Ms Dashwood told MailOnline.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned of the possibility of some local tsunami effects, although it said the inland earthquake would not generate a destructive widespread tsunami.

'I swear I never felt one so strong, I 
thought the building was going to collapse,' said Sebastian Herrera, 42,
a businessman from a neighbourhood hit hard in Mexico's devastating 
1985 earthquake, which killed thousands. 

Groups of women hugged and cried at Mexico City's Angel of Independence monument, where hundreds of people evacuated from office buildings said they never had felt such a strong earthquake. Others typed ferociously on their Blackberries.

Samantha Rodriguez, a 37-year old 
environmental consultant, was evacuated from the 11th floor on the Angel
Tower office building.

'I thought it was going to pass rapidly but the walls began to thunder and we decided to get out,' she said.

Rosa Maria Lopez Velazquez, 62, nearly passed out as she stood outside a mall in the capital. 'I have problems with pressure,' she said. 'I felt I was going to faint.'

Children stood terrified as the earthquake hit right near lunchtime, at 12.02 pm local time

Superficial: In spite of the strength of the quake, most of the damage appears to be relatively insignificant

Transport chaos: A driver stands by his car looking up at battered buildings and trying to use his mobile phone network

'It was very strong, but we didn't see anything fall,' said Irma Ortiz, who runs a guesthouse in Oaxaca, near Guerrero. She said their telephones were down and that the quake had shaken the hotel from side to side.

The earthquake began six miles (10km) underground,  and was followed by a 4.8-magnitude aftershock, according to Mexico's national seismological agency.

Mexico City's airport was closed for a short time but there was no damage to runways and operations were returning to normal.

Tremors were felt as far away as Guatemala City.

President Felipe Calderon said there were no immediate reports of major damage.

Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter that the water system and other 'strategic services' were not experiencing problems.
