Officials are currently engaged in a desperate search for a University of Virginia student who was last seen over the weekend.

Hannah Elizabeth Graham, 18, texted her friends at 1.20am on Saturday morning to say she was heading to meet them at a party but never arrived, according to the Charlottesville police.

Friends and family have not heard anything from Hannah since and police have launched a search of wooded areas for the student, whose parents are from England, using a bloodhound.

Search: University of Virginia officials have launched a huge hunt for missing 18-year-old student Hannah Elizabeth Graham 

Hannah, who is not a US citizen is 5'11" with blue eyes and light brown hair. She lives off campus and is from Northern Virginia and resides in the US using a Green Card.

'As some of you may have heard, Hannah Graham is missing. She was last seen leaving Camden Plaza around 11:50 late Friday night and last heard from a little after 1am, Saturday,' one post shared on Facebook states.

The search has so far failed to find Hannah, after the alarm was raised on Sunday morning.

'On Sunday, her friends and family realized that none of them had seen or had contact with her since Friday night and a call was placed to the Emergency Communications Center by her friends, reporting her missing,' said Lt. Ronnie Roberts, of the Charlottesville Police Department to the Daily Progress.

'Police detectives responded immediately and have been working to find Hannah since learning of her disappearance. A search using a bloodhound was conducted Sunday evening, but that search did not turn up anything useful.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Charlottesville Police Department at 970-3280 or Crimestoppers at 977-4000. 

Appeal: Friends and family of the student have asked anyone with any information to call UVA police
