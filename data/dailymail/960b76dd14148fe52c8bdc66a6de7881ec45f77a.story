Father of three: Roy Tomlinson spotted the iPhone on the floor near where the young patient was sitting

A callous hospital cleaner has been spared jail and fined just £350 after he stole an iPhone from a young cancer patient who had just finished a course of radiotherapy.

Father-of-three Roy Tomlinson, 46, of Aspley, Nottingham, spotted the iPhone on the floor near where Nathan Read was sitting.

After swiping the phone at Nottingham City Hospital he was unable to get it to work - and dumped the device in a public toilet.

Mr Read, 22, realised his phone had gone missing while he waited outside the hospital in January, Nottingham Magistrates’ Court was told.

He reported the theft to hospital security staff - who scrolled through CCTV footage and spotted Tomlinson bending down next to his victim.

Mr Read also used an app on his phone to track it down to the same street where Tomlinson lived.

After he told police Tomlinson, who had worked at the hospital for 26 years, was arrested and charged. He admitted one count of theft last month and was yesterday ordered to pay £349.99 compensation and £85 court costs.

The court heard that Tomlinson had dumped the phone in the cistern of a public toilet after he was unable to unlock it.

Tomlinson, who represented himself, 
refused to comment on the incident when asked by magistrates - and did 
not say anything outside court.

Probation officer John Davies told the court the defendant had mental health issues and ‘felt remorse’. He added: ‘On this day, his life seems to have overwhelmed him.

‘He recently heard about the death of a colleague, there were difficulties at home, he was upset his daughter was suffering from health problems. With his anxiety, things became too much for him.

‘He couldn’t explain why he took the phone. He did not know who [it] belonged to. The following day he tried to retrieve the phone and realised it was already recovered. He said he panicked.’
