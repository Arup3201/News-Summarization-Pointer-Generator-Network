Islamic State militants are using huge numbers of U.S.-made bullets to maim and kill innocent victims across Iraq and Syria, a new survey has revealed.

A study of more than 1,700 shells fired by ISIS in the Kurdish regions of the two countries found that 20 per cent were manufactured in America.

Only ammunition from the former Soviet Union and China were found in greater numbers in a list of 21 countries ranging from Serbia and Romania to North Korea and Sudan.

Mark of origin: A survey of ammunition fired by jihadists in Iraq and Syria shows huge numbers of bullets were made in the U.S, including these four rifle cartridges which were manufactured at the U.S.-government owned Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008

In the case of the United States, much of the ammunition was likely seized when the jihadists sent Iraqi forces fleeing during its lightning uprising  in June.

The report found that many of the 323 U.S.-made cartridges were manufactured between 2000 and 2010 - a period when America was arming the Iraqi army following the second Gulf War.

Conflict Armament Research (CAR), which conducted the study, noted in its report: 'IS forces appear to have acquired a large part of their current arsenal from stocks seized from, or abandoned by, Iraqi defence and security forces.

'The U.S. gifted much of this materiel to Iraq.'

Analysis of the markings on the bottom of the shells found that many had been made at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Missouri.

The shells comprised mainly 5.56 x 45mm cartridges which are used in U.S.-supplied M16 and M4 assault rifles, the report said.

The spent shell casings were collected between July 22 and August 15 by a private arms-tracing group in four Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria.

One of those included the Sinjar Mountains where up to 200,000 Yazidis to flee after the terror group stormed the surrounding villages and captured women to be sold as sex slaves.

The wide range of countries which supplied the bullets indicates just how nebulous the situation is on the ground in the Middle East, with different factions obtaining weaponry by various means and sources.

CAR, a non-profit research organisation funded by the European Union report, said: 'The sample includes ammunition manufactured in 21 countries during a period of nearly 70 years (1945–2014).

'The variety and age of ammunition used by IS forces indicates a large array of ammunition supply sources, which is attributable to the group having captured materiel during numerous engagements and against various opponents, across Iraq and Syria.'

Bullets from the Russian federation were much newer - as recent as seven months - suggesting they had been obtained from Syrian forces, the study said.
