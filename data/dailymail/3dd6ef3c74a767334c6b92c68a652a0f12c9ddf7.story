It was the final day of the Grand National Festival at Aintree today and many racegoers took it as their opportunity to wear their brightest, boldest and best outfits for the full day of gripping racing action.

From fluorescent dresses and large fascinators for the women, to floral head-to-toe multi-coloured suits for the men - there were styles of all kinds on offer at the Liverpool racecourse.

Despite yesterday being Ladies Day - with scores of women attending the day in their finest attire – dozens of females still used today’s final day of racing as an excuse to don their posh frocks and high heels.

Here come the girls! A group of women pose in their brightly-coloured dresses as they soak up the atmosphere at the final day of racing at this year's Grand National Festival at Aintree Racecourse

Despite yesterday being Ladies Day at the course, women still put on their best frocks for today's final day of racing. One woman, left, was spotted arriving at the course in a sleek cream dress, black fascinator and towering high heels while two other ladies, right, posed for a selfie of themselves in their brightly-coloured dresses

The full day of racing appeared to be a bit much for some spectators and one woman was spotted sitting on the ground - despite there being plenty of empty chairs nearby

Some women opted for stylish ensembles, including two stunning ladies, left, who went for a chic monochrome look, while others opted for a brighter and bolder get-up, including one woman, right, who teamed a dusty pink mini dress with a hot pink blazer and chunky metallic wedge heels

The wet weather didn't dampen the spirit of racegoers and many women ensured they kept dry their hair and outfit dry with a trusty umbrella

As always, the women cranked up the glamour for the biggest day in the racing calendar, with many having applied fake tan, voluminous hair extensions and heavy make-up prior to putting on their brightly-coloured embellished dresses.

Many looked stunning in their stylish ensembles, including two women who opted for sleek and chic monochrome dresses, and the majority of ladies opted for an outfit which gave a nod to the summer's floral and pastel trends.

However, despite many making their best effort to look good, bouts of rain at the racecourse caused havoc with some of the well-turned out women who desperately tried to shield themselves from the wet weather with coats and ponchos.

It wasn’t just the women who made all the effort today though – several men also tried to pick up style points with their choice of outfit.

Four men could be seen wearing head-to-toe suits which were each printed differently with brightly-coloured graphics. One had a get-up which was covered in images of numerous packs of cards while another opted for a mismatched floral ensemble.

Despite the wet weather, it didn’t dampen spirits at the course and thousands still enjoyed drinks aplenty as they watched the biggest race of the year – the Crabbie’s Grand National Chase.

It all proved a bit too much for one reveller who was spotted apparently passed out on the ground at the racecourse, surrounded by empty drinks cans

The long day did appear to take its toll on some spectators though – and many could be seen catching up on sleep at the course.

One man, surrounded by discarded drinks cans, appeared to have passed out on the floor, while another woman looked worse for wear as she lay on the ground surrounded by empty chairs.

There wasn’t quite as much action among spectators at the course today compared to yesterday though – when a fight broke out between three men.

The men, all dressed in suits, shirts and ties, started brawling near to the finishing post and nearby spectators had to dodge the pints of beer which were sent flying during the ruckus.

The majority of ladies opted for a glamorous take on the summer's floral and pastel trends while some others decided to play it safe with a darker colour. Due to the wet weather, most women teamed their fancy frock with a blazer, coat and umbrella

Some women appeared to be less-than-impressed with the wet and windy weather although others took it in their stride and didn't let it stop them enjoying the day out

While Cheltenham is famous for pearls and fur, and Royal Ascot for its hats, Aintree has become synonymous with fashionable girls out to have fun in the highest heels they can find.

Eschewing cosy coats and tights in favour of goose-pimpled bare legs and delicate frocks, Aintree girls are almost as famous for their ability to withstand the cold as they are for their colouful approach to style.

As with the Cheltenham Festival, organisers refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to dress smartly and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes.

But perhaps a warning isn't required: Liverpudlians are famous for their glamorous approach to getting dressed and love nothing more than the chance to strut their stuff in the most eye-catching outfits they can find.

And more is definitely more when it comes to make-up and grooming too, with glossy long locks, honey-toned skin and lashings of lipgloss among the most popular beauty choices.

Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of equestrian glamour either, with the majority plumping for dapper suits or a blazer, although some decide to up the ante with a spot of fancy dress.

Despite the presence of the infamous Becher's Brook on the course, the colourfully dressed Aintree crowd are enough to ensure that as many people watch the Grand National for the fashion as they do for the race itself.

It wasn't just the women who opted for stylish ensembles - some men opted for smart get-ups too including this group who stood out from the crown in the bold trousers
