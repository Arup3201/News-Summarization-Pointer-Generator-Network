A mom's decision to change her baby's diaper in the middle of a Starbucks in Denver ended with a call to the police.

On a coffee run Friday night, Ruth Burgos ran her one-year-old son Thiago to the restroom but there was no changing table.

Instead, she wiped her baby down in the seating area.

When you gotta go: Little Thiago Burgos needed his diaper changing at a Starbucks store but there was no changing table in the restroom

Demeaned: Alex and Ruth Burgos say they felt as though they were spoken to inappropriately by Staff at the Denver Starbucks

War of words: After being told to clean up after their son, Alex Burgos deliberately poured his coffee on the floor and told the store to clean up after him

She says the coffee chain left her with no choice but to do it in the middle of the store.

A Starbucks employee came over to Ms. Burgos and her husband Alex with a rag and told them to clean up after themselves.

Ms Bargos says she was spoken to in a 'demeaning' way.

The barista told her to make sure she wiped the seat down after she had finished changing her son and 'tossed' her a rag. 'Then they started talking amongst themselves and laughing about it,' Burgos told USA Today.

Oblivious: Thiago Burgo, 1, had no idea what all the arguing was about but he apparently made gurgling noises after he was clean and enjoyed seeing the flashing lights from the police car

Apology: Starbucks has apologized to the family and said it wants all its customers to be treated with 'dignity and respect'

Law enforcers: The police were called after an argument erupted inside the store however no arrests were made

Her husband. Alex, was offended by the employees actions and so he deliberately poured his venti coffee all over the floor.

As left the store he told them to clean up after themselves.

The store called Denver police to report a 'disturbance'.

'Strong words and hand gestures' were exchanged, although nobody was arrested her husband Alex explained.

'I hope other families don't get treated the way we did,' Ms Burgos said. 'As a mother, you have to do what you have to do. Wherever you have to do it.'

'It's really frustrating as a parent or as a child care provider,' said Jami Dennis, president of Glendale-based ABC Nannies.

Dennis says a lot of family friendly businesses don't have changing tables, but doing a diaper change out in the open should only be a parent's last resort.

'To avoid situations where you make other people uncomfortable, I would try to do it in private,' Dennis said.

Starbucks has apologized to the family and said it wants its customers to be treated with 'dignity and respect.'
