A California woman has told how a three-foot-long piece of metal from an airplane fell from the sky and almost crashed down ontop of her while cycling through Huntington Beach last Thursday - the same day a JetBlue airplane was forced to make an emergency landing after one of its engines malfunctioned.

JetBlue Flight 1416 - carrying 142 passengers and five crew members - had taken off from Long Beach - just 15 miles north-west of where the plane part fell - headed for Austin, Texas, when one of its engines exploded not long after takeoff, filling the cabin with smoke.

Cindy Gilbert said she was riding her bike along the Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach when the metal part  - known as a c-duct - landed just a few feet away from her.

'It literally fell from the sky,' Mrs Gilbert told CNN.

'No comment': JetBlue are yet to saying anything about the plane part, which they say is under investigation

Flightpath: The plane left Long Beach last Thursday heading for Austin, Texas, but turned around not long after takeoff. The piece of the plane fell down in Huntington Beach, about 15 miles southeast of the airport

Mrs Gilbert carried the part home in her bicycle and called the Federal Aviation Administration.

A FAA official then came to her Fountain Valley to collect the part.

The officer reportedly told Mrs Gilbert the part was indeed from JetBlue flight 1416, CNN reported.

JetBlue have refused to comment on the incident, which they say remains under investigation.

Four people were injured as part of the engine incident.

A video filmed by a passenger wearing an oxygen mask shows the dramatic scene inside the aircraft.

Passengers are seen expressing confusion as they are shrouded in a haze of smoke and a wailing child is heard in the background, but everyone remains calm as they prepare for the emergency landing.

Remain calm:  The man who filmed the dramatic scene turns the camera on himself before giving a wave

Amidst the confusion, a passenger asks, ‘Did we blow an engine?’, as the man films the cabin’s interior and the scenery outside.

At one point, he turns the camera on himself, showing his oxygen mask, and gives a wave.

Moments later, the pilot announces that plane has suffered a right engine failure and the engine has been ‘shut down’.

He tells passengers to remain in their seats while the aircraft returns to Long Beach Airport in suburban Los Angeles.

An air steward tells them to stay out of the bathrooms and keep seatbelts fastened.

The twin-engine Airbus A320 was carrying 142 passengers and five crew

The pilot informed passengers that the right engine had failed and the plane was returning to Long Beach

Twilight actor Jackson Rathbone, one of the passengers on board, documented the harrowing ordeal in a series of tweets and photos.

He wrote that the engine ‘exploded’ before smoke clouded the plane and revealed his relief at having landed safely.

Mr Rathbone, who played Jasper Hale in the wildly popular vampire franchise, told his Twitter followers that he said a prayer and held his wife and young son in his arms. 

The actor posted a picture to whosay.com showing passengers coming off the plane with the help of the Long Beach Fire Department.

He wrote: 'From the bus, we all just followed one after another. I never felt so okay being a lemming.' He then posted a selfie, adding: 'Where are we going/ don't care we're alive- face.'

Airport spokeswoman Cassie Perez-Harmison said no one was injured during the evacuation, but three people were tended to at the scene and a fourth was taken to hospital for observation

A second video filmed by a passenger shows the cabin clear of smoke as it makes a safe landing.

Passengers evacuated onto the runway using the plane’s emergency slides.

Airport spokeswoman Cassie Perez-Harmison said no one was injured during the evacuation, but three people were tended to at the scene and a fourth was taken to hospital for observation.

The pilot declared the emergency and used an ‘extinguishing agent’ when the cockpit received an ‘overheat warning’ on the engine.
