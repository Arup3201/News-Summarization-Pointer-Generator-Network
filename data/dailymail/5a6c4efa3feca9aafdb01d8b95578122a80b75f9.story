'Bank robber': Englishman Mark Rothwell, 49, has been charged with robbing a bank - despite having won a medal for foiling a similar hold-up in 2010

A man who was hailed as a community hero after thwarting a bank robbery by tackling the would-be thief to the ground has allegedly committed a hold-up of his own. 

Mark Rothwell, a 49-year-old Englishman, is accused of barging into a community bank in Portland, Oregon, with a 9mm handgun drawn.

Police say he shouted at the tellers to hand over everything they had, then made off in a pickup truck with a bag stuffed with notes totaling $15,703.

Officers tracked down his white Toyota Tacoma and found the cash stashed inside, along with the gun, according to an arrest affidavit.

Sniffer dogs then led police Rothwell, who apparently confessed to the robbery on the spot. He reportedly told officers: 'It's me you want... I just robbed the bank'.

It is a dramatic reversal for Rothwell, who was awarded a Civilian Medal for Heroism in 2010 for tackling a man to the ground as he tried to rob a Chase Bank.

He knocked a gun - later revealed to be fake - out of the man's hand, then pinned him to the ground while officers arrived.

However, Rothwell allegedly surpassed that would-be criminal by taking a real 9mm Baretta firearm into the Albina Community Bank and making off with the cash.

Police are yet to suggest a motive for Rothwell, who was born in London but moved to the United States more than a decade ago and now runs a home renovation business.

According to The Oregonian, bank employees as well as surveillance footage confirmed that Rothwell was the man involved in the robbery.

Bank tellers were reportedly able to recognize him because he did not fully cover his face, and had a recognizably European accent.

Giving an account of his earlier crime-fighting, in a 2010 interview Rothwell said he sprang into action after hearing the would-be robber threaten the teller, who reminded him of his daughter.

He said: 'He [the suspect] knew her name, and for a second I thought it was some kind of weird joke.'

'It's just one of those things - someone points a gun at a girl just a couple of years older than my own daughter. It just rubbed me the wrong way.'

Rothwell, a father of two, told the Oregonian at the time that he had been a policeman himself, and had served in the military.

At the time of the first robbery, he said police at first mistook him for the suspect.

He also hinted at a criminal past of his own, saying of his award: 'Let's just say it's nice to be on the right side of the law this time.'

On Friday his public defender lawyer, Ruben Iniguez, declined to comment. Rothwell is due to be arraigned on March 12.
