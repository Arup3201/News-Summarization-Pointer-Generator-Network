Nigel de Jong scored an 86th-minute winner as AC Milan beat Sassuolo 2-1 on Tuesday to reach the Italian Cup quarter-finals and avenge a defeat to the same opponent last week.

Giampaolo Pazzini put Milan ahead after 38 minutes at San Siro with an acrobatic shot following a cross from newly signed Alessio Cerci.

Nicola Sansone equalized with a penalty in the 64th, but De Jong prevented extra time by volleying in the rebound after a shot by Andrea Poli hit the crossbar.
