A Virginia inmate is one several people isolated at hospitals across the country under suspicion for Ebola.

The unidentified female inmate incarcerated at a Loundon County jail was taken to Inova Loudon Hospital after coming down with a fever.

Public officials are testing the woman for Ebola out of precaution since she traveled to West Africa in recent weeks. However, officials say there's a 'very low probability' she has the deadly virus.

The inmate is just one of many potential Ebola cases across the nation including a Yale student and a Florida man.

These new cases were reported as the CDC today conceded it is not entirely sure how to contain the disease.

A Virginia inmate is being tested at Inova Loudon Hospital in Leesburg for Ebola. The unidentified woman had recently raveled from West Africa and was showing signs of the deadly disease, but officials say there a 'very low probability' she has the virus

Officials at Yale-New Haven Hospital today revealed the patient admitted last night was one of the university's student researchers monitoring the outbreak in Liberia.

The Floridian man being examined in Jacksonville is under observation after coming into close contact with someone who recently traveled to west Africa.

In California, Southwestern College was cordoned off for a few hours this morning following the news that a student had been on the same flight as Ebola-hit nurse Amber Jay Vinson - and her younger sister has since vomited.  

Connecticut fears: A patient who recently returned from Liberia is being tested at Yale-New Haven hospital

Florida: Memorial Hospital, Jacksonville, is testing someone who had contact with a person from west Africa

California: Officials posted this statement on the college's Facebook page this morning after closing

Congress today blasted the CDC for failing to put in place strict measures to block the spread of the disease, which has now infected at least eight people on US soil, disregarding the potential cases under review in Connecticut, Florida and California. 

Despite testing negative for the disease during the trip, the Yale student has been under voluntary isolation since returning to the United States on October 11.

Last night, they contacted the hospital asking to be tested again. The tests have since come back negative.

'Yale-New Haven Hospital admitted a patient late Wednesday night for evaluation of Ebola-like symptoms,' the hospital said. 

'We have not confirmed or ruled-out any diagnosis at this point. We are working in cooperation with city, state and federal health officials. There is no further information available at this time.'

Officials will know more later today, WSFB reported. 

The other Yale University student researcher that was tested for the virus in Liberia is still in isolation.

Staff at Jacksonville's Memorial Hospital believe it is 'high unlikely' that their patient has Ebola, a spokesman said.

However, they are following the CDC's emergency guidelines while closely monitoring the case.

The patient has been transferred to Baptist Health for testing.

A spokesman at Baptist Health told First Coast News: 'We have admitted a patient with common flu-like symptoms (but no fever) who is being tested for Ebola on the basis of self-reported casual contact with a West Africa traveler. 

'This patient is in isolation and is being monitored closely for their protection as well as the safety of our team members and the community.'

Guidelines? Congress is concerned the CDC does not know how to control the disease after Dr Thomas Frieden accused Dallas nurses of wearing too much protective clothing when treating patient zero Thomas Duncan

The statement continued: 'There is no confirmation that this patient has Ebola; in fact, that diagnosis is highly unlikely. We are exercising extreme caution and are using CDC protocols to rule out the Ebola virus, for everyone's peace of mind.'

In California, a nurse who examined the student claims she believes it is unlikely there is any risk of an Ebola diagnosis. 

In a statement released by Southwestern College, a spokesman said: 'A student and her family had been traveling to the Midwest last week.

'Upon their return, the sister exhibited flu like symptoms and has been hospitalized.

'The student is NOT exhibiting ANY flu like symptoms.

'The student contacted the instructor to inform the instructor why the student had not been in class.In an abundance of caution by some staff members, the 470 building was cordoned off.Our campus nurse has thoroughly examined the student and there IS NO EXPECTATION OF EBOLA.' 

All of the scares come as CDC officials struggle to deliver strict guidelines on how to control the disease.

CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden initially blamed nurses for breaching the protection guidelines set out by the center.

Today, he accused the medics of wearing too much protection which is difficult to remove, thereby 'increasing the risk of infection'.

He will today be forced to explain the center's policy on Ebola and understanding on how to control it at a congressional committee.

Outbreak: Amber Jay Vinson, 29, (left) and Nina Pham, 26, (right) have been infected with the disease despite wearing clothing while treating Duncan, the Liberian man who brought Ebola to the United States last month

Two nurses have now contracted the deadly virus despite wearing full personal protection equipment while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died last week of Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. 

Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Jay Vinson, 29, do not know how they became infected, and officials are investigating to try to find out. 

Pham has since undergone a blood transfusion in a bid to fight the disease.

The recent diagnosis of Vinson has sparked fears across the nation after it emerged she spent time in Cleveland, Ohio, when she knew she had a fever.

Vinson told the CDC she was ill but it has emerged the center said she could board a commercial flight from the Ohio city to Dallas, Texas.

Schools and hospitals are now on lock-down across Cleveland, with nurses and teachers being sent home, and two schools closed.
