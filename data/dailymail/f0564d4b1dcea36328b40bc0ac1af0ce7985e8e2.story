A number of heartless looters have emerged amid the tragedy of the deadly Oklahoma tornado, storming a storm-damaged hospital facility and helping themselves to various items, a report claims.

Reports of looting came in as Moore, one of the hardest-hit towns in the storm, deals with the loss of more than 51 people who have been confirmed dead, and another 120 injured.

The vandals were spotted at the Moore Medical Center, a small facility that sustained damage in the twister.

It was a location that was hit hard by the twister, and where rescuers sprung into action to get 15 workers out of the building.

KFOR reported that the National Guard has been called in to deal with the looters.

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokeswoman Keli Cain said that the hospital was evacuated and all 13 of its patients were transferred to other facilities.

Cain said she didn't know the conditions of the patients or the extent of the damage at the hospital, which is southwest of Oklahoma City.

Officials at two hospitals say 
they're treating more than 120 patients, including about 70 children, 
after a massive tornado hit suburban Oklahoma City.

Medical Center spokesman Scott Coppenbarger says the hospital and a
