These sickening pictures show the disturbing fantasy world imagined by Islamic State extremists - despite increasing pressure from American airstrikes and reports they are being driven out of crucial Syrian border town Kobane.

Overnight U.S.-led coalition warplanes are said to have carried out more than a dozen bomb attacks around Raqqa, the northern Syrian city adopted as the de facto headquarters of Isis.

But as America and its allies bear down on the jihadists, photoshopped pictures circulating online show the chilling truth of what Isis hopes to achieve.

In one image, terrorist fighters overrun the Capitol building in Washington, and fly an extremist banner from the top in a scene that echoes the fictional attack on the US embassy in Islamabad by the Taliban, in the series Homeland.

Fantasy: The U.S. Senate is shown engulfed in flames and flying the Islamic State flag

Air force: This unlikely fantasy shows Isis with the ability to attack from above. The fighter-jet is branded with the Isis logo

The image was shared by Russian-speaking Isis militants, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

Isis flags fly from the iconic building, which is engulfed in flames, and the American flag is falling.

Reality: Smoke rises from the Syrian border town of Kobani  following the US-led coalition airstrikes on New Year's Eve

A second image created and circulated by Russian-speaking terrorists is of smiling Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, with Big Ben burning in the background.

The caption reads: 'Soon!! In all cities of the world', according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.  

Another fantasy depicts a white horse carrying the Isis flag escaping from the mouths of hungry wolves. 

It could have a number of different meanings, but it seems to depict a pure (white) Isis overpowering those standing in its way.

In September, it was reported that Isis militants were changing tactics in the face of U.S.-led air strikes in Iraq by ditching conspicuous convoys in favour of motorcycles.

But it seems these terrorists dream of an air force, although this fantasy it very unlikely to come true.

The group's logo is painted on a black fighter-jet and another shows a 'pilot of the Islamic State'.

But these fantasies could not be further from the reality.

In December, it was reported that Isis has lost ground in  Kobane, where Kurdish fighters now control more than 60 percent of territory.

The strategically located town on the border with Turkey has become a major symbol of resistance against Isis, which has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists launched a major offensive in mid-September to try to capture Kobane, and at one point controlled more than half of the town, known in Arabic as Ain al-Arab.

But supported by US-led air strikes and reinforced by Kurds from Iraq, 'Kurdish forces now control more than 60 percent of the city', said Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

More than 76,000 people were killed in Syria last year.

The death toll of 76,021 included 17,790 civilians, among them 3,501 children and 1,987 women, 15,488 rebel and Islamic fighters, and 12,861 regular regime soldiers and officers,according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
