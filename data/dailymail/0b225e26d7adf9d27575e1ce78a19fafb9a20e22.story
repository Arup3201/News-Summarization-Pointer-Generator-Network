A five-month-old pit bull was stranded on a highway during morning rush-hour in New York after being hit by a car, leaving him with a broken leg.

The puppy, named Rocky by his rescuers, wandered onto the westbound lanes of the Grand Central Parkway near the Long Island Expressway exit, on Monday.

NYPD responded to a call of a 'vicious dog' on the highway at 8.21am, according to NBC New York.  

But when Officers Mezzoiuso and Morinia-Blocker from the 110 Precinct arrived at the scene, they found Rocky motionless, frightened and injured in the middle lane.

Morinia-Blocker positioned the car to keep Rocky and his colleague safe while Mezzoiuso walked towards the dog. 

As the puppy was unable to move, Mezzoiuso picked up the injured animal and carried him to the side of the road.

He was taken to a branch of animal hospital, ASPCA in Queens and was later transferred to its Manhattan office where veterinarians assessed his condition.

Both officers visited Rocky yesterday before he underwent surgery on his leg at the ASPCA - and he is expected to make a full recovery. 

He will continue to receive 'around the clock care' as he recovers, an ASPCA spokesperson told The Queens Courier. 

It is not known if Rocky has an owner or how he ended up on the highway, and the matter is now under investigation, police said.

The animal hospital is urging anyone with information about Rocky to come forward.
