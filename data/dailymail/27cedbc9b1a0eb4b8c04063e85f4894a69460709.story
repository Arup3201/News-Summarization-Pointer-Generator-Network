Decision time: David Cameron arrives at Number 10 yesterday, where he made his case for Britain to join in an attack on Syria

Britain cannot ‘stand idly by’ as the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons to attack innocent children, David Cameron said last night.

Making his first public case for Britain joining a retaliatory attack on the regime of tyrant Bashar al-Assad, the Prime Minister said the use of chemical weapons was ‘morally indefensible’.

Mr Cameron, who announced MPs would be recalled tomorrow to debate military action, said: ‘What we have seen in Syria are appalling scenes of death and suffering because of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

'I don’t believe we can let that stand.’

Nick Clegg also appeared to back military action, saying: ‘The murder of innocent men, women and children through the use of chemical weapons is a repugnant crime ... if we stand idly by we set a very dangerous precedent indeed.’

But former Army chief Lord Dannatt warned against an attack, saying it could make the conflict in Syria even worse.

Ed Miliband, who was briefed in Downing Street yesterday, struck a more cautious note, saying Labour would ‘consider’ backing the action provided it was legal and limited.

Many Tory MPs are also sceptical about any intervention in Syria’s bloody civil war, and Mr Cameron faces a tense Commons vote tomorrow night.

On another day of dramatic developments:

Mr Cameron, who will chair a meeting of the National Security Council today, said a military response to last week’s atrocity in Damascus was ‘not about getting involved in a Middle Eastern war or changing our stance in Syria, or going further into that conflict’.

‘It’s about chemical weapons,’ he insisted. ‘Their use is wrong and the world should not stand idly by.’

He said all the evidence suggested Assad was responsible for last week’s atrocity in a Damascus suburb, which killed hundreds and injured thousands. But, conscious of the mistakes of the Iraq war, he acknowledged there was ‘never 100 per cent certainty’.

Mr Cameron, who said there was evidence Assad had used chemical weapons at least ten times, said any attack would have to be ‘proportionate, have to be legal, (and) would have to specifically be about deterring the use of chemical weapons’.

The G20 summit of world leaders in Russia next Thursday is likely to be dominated by the Syrian crisis.

David Cameron and Barack Obama will be in St Petersburg as guests of Vladimir Putin, who has issued a strong condemnation of any military action by the West.

Russia, which along with China is a staunch supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, has sold him a stockpile of weapons reported to include helicopter gunships.

In a difficult phone call on Monday night, Mr Putin told Mr Cameron there was no evidence of a chemical weapons attack.

But the Prime Minister told the Russian president there was ‘little doubt’ one had been carried out by the regime’s forces.

Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of having ‘engineered a media campaign to facilitate a military incursion’.

Relations between Moscow and the US are at a low ebb, especially since CIA whistleblower Ed Snowden was granted temporary asylum in Russia.

He said that a final decision on military action had not been taken. But his words left little doubt that he is ready to order a British submarine in the region to fire cruise missiles at targets in Syria as part of an allied attack.

Attorney general Dominic Grieve has been asked to draw up a detailed legal opinion underpinning the case for military action without a United Nations mandate.

The Cabinet will meet tomorrow to approve the plans before the Prime Minister heads to the Commons to try to persuade MPs to back the high-risk intervention.

Lord Dannatt was the latest high-profile figure to question the legality and purpose of the proposed military strike. Describing the plans as inappropriate, he said Assad’s probable use of chemical weapons, however wrong, did ‘not constitute an open invitation for the international community to impose themselves on the internal affairs of another country’.

Lord Dannatt, who headed the British intervention in Kosovo, said it was unclear what the military objective of the plan was, adding: ‘We run a risk of fuelling the conflict and making it worse’.

Conservative Richard Ottaway, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was doubtful whether the West could legally intervene on humanitarian grounds.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem denied the regime had used chemical weapons and challenged Washington to present proof backing up its accusations.

He said missile strikes would play into the hands of Al Qaeda sympathisers fighting with the Syrian rebels. He added: ‘If we face aggression, we will defend ourselves. We will not hesitate to use any means available.’ The Arab League said the Syrian regime was ‘fully responsible for the ugly crime’.

Military might: A picture released by the US Navy shows the

Harry S. Truman sailing through the Strait of Gibraltar earlier this 
month

The might of the US Navy was seen heading towards the Syrian coast in a photograph released yesterday.

Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S Truman supported by guided missile carrier USS Gettysburg, moved into position ready to fire missiles into the heart of Damascus.

US defence secretary Chuck Hagel said yesterday the military was ‘ready to go’ immediately with ‘all options’ against the Syrian regime.

‘We have moved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take,’ he declared. ‘We are prepared ... we are ready to go.’

The Harry S Truman has a crew of almost 6,000 and carries at least 90 Tomahawk missiles and the Gettysburg carries a mixture of 122 long and short-range missiles.

The release of the picture, taken earlier this month by the US Navy, came as Britain put a squadron of Typhoon aircraft – in the Middle East on exercise – on standby to support any Coalition strike.

Security at British bases in Cyprus has also been increased in case of reprisal attacks.

More than 650 Royal Marines, who are due to arrive in Jordan late next week for an exercise with US forces, are set to be issued with chemical warfare suits and respirators as a precaution.

A British nuclear submarine is understood to be in the eastern Mediterranean and is fully loaded with Tomahawk missiles ready to strike key targets if the command comes.
