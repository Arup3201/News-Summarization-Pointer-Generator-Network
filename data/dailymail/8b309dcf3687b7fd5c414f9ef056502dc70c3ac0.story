Forget about the Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain, now two Englishmen and a Welshman have gone up a mountain and come down a hill.

The three ramblers have stripped a remote mountain in the Scottish Highlands of its status after measuring it at two foot six inches below the official height.

John Barnard, Graham Jackson and Myrddyn Phillips set out to complete Britain's most daring mountain survey on Knight's Peak on the Isle of Skye.

Peak, highlighted, has been downgraded after three amateur cartographers
 scaled it and found it fell short of mountain status by just 
six-and-a-half inches

'It was a difficult climb to the summit':

harnesses and helmets

Measurements: The Leica GS15 is a state-of-the-art, highly precise dual frequency GPS mapping tool

Maps list the jagged rocky peak in the Cuillin mountain range at 3,002ft high, just two feet above the 3,000ft required height for mountain status.

However it has been a source of controversy among hillwalkers who suspected it fell short of the height given on the maps.

Equipped with state-of-the-art GPS technology, the trio carried out the risky climb with ropes, harnesses and helmets. Then they spent two hours at the summit recording hundreds of measurements.

While nearby peak Basteir Tooth was confirmed at 3,009ft, the reading for Knight's Peak fell short of the magic mountain mark of 3,000ft by just six-and-a-half inches.

As a result, Knight's Peak has been stripped of its status as a 'munro top' - the name given to secondary peaks in Scotland above 3,000ft.

Their escapade is a deflating inversion of the story of The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain, a film in which a Welsh villagers conspire to turn their local hill into a mountain by building an earth cairn on top of it to restore their town's pride.

work of Scottish mountaineer Sir Hugo Munro, who compiled the first list
 of Scottish mountains in 1891

The findings have been accepted by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, custodians of the official list of munros and munro tops.

Munros are named after Scottish mountaineer Sir Hugo Munro, who compiled the first list of Scottish mountains over 3,000ft in 1891.

A munro top is also a summit above 3,000ft, but one that is considered a secondary peak of a munro.

The most famous munro is Ben Nevis, which stands at 4,409ft tall.

Mr Phillips, 52, said: 'We have surveyed over 150 summits in Britain but none compared to the task we set ourselves in the Cuillin Mountains.

'Knight's Peak has long been a source of controversy because in the early 1970s it was listed on Ordnance Survey maps as being 2,994ft tall.

'Then, when it appeared in the Munro Tables in 1997, its height was given as 2,998ft which is still below the 3,000ft mark but it was included anyway.

'Current maps list it as 3,002ft.

'Hill walkers have been arguing about its true height for a long time and we wanted to provide a definitive answer.

'In that sense we are continuing the great work of Sir Hugh Munro in accurately mapping Scotland's munros.

'While he had to use an aneroid barometer to get his measurements, we use dual frequency GPS mapping tools.

'It was a difficult climb to the summit but we got the definitive data we were after which confirms it falls short of the 3,000ft mark.'

Andy Nisbet, president of the Scottish Mountaineering Club, said the reclassification of Knight's Peak had been met with mixed reactions from club members.

He said: 'There are some who think it's a shame that Knight's Peak is no longer a munro top because it is very dramatic and one of the hardest to summit.

'However others are more concerned with having the most accurate list of munro tops possible.

'The figures speak for themselves though - Knight's Peak is not 3,000ft high.

'The Scottish Mountaineering Club accepts the findings of the survey and future tables and books will reflect the new classification.'

Mark Greaves, a geodetic analyst at the Ordnance Survey, said official maps would now be ammended with the new heights for Knight's Peak and Basteir Tooth.

He said: 'We are provided with the data which we then cross check. The results will be rounded up or down to the nearest metre and then changed on our maps.'

Mr Barnard and Mr Jackson are retired research chemists from Mold, north Wales, and Cheshire respectively, and Mr Phillips is a former manager at a printing firm and lives near Shrewsbury.

They have measured over 150 hills in England, Scotland and Wales since 2008 and downgraded two munro tops previous to Knight's Peak - Sgyrr nan Ceannaichean and Beinn a' Chlaidheimh.

They have also elevated two hills to mountain status, which in England and Wales is classed as 2,000ft.

In 2008 they measured Mynydd Graig Goch in Snowdonia at 2,000ft and 6 inches - up from 1,998ft.

Earlier this year they upgraded Thack Moor in the Cumbrian Penines from 1,998ft to 2,000ft.

Required height for a Scots mountain, or munro, is 3,000ft

But new survey finds it misses that mark by just six-and-a-half inches
