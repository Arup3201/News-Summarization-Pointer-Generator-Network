A man was killed on his first day at a new job after his colleague lost control of her speeding car as she gave him a lift home. 

Charles Punter, 25, of Colchester, Essex had finished his first day at a marketing firm when he was offered a lift by after he had problems getting into work. 

Co-worker Rebecca Price, 29, also of Colchester, lost control of her Ford Ka as she sped round a bend, smashing into an oncoming 'pick-up' car.  

Police crash investigators later 
concluded that mother-of-one Price had been travelling at up to 45 mph 
on the 30mph stretch of road.

She was charged with causing death by careless driving following the horrific accident.

Price appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex, for sentencing after admitting the single charge. 

She stood weeping in the dock as Recorder Malcolm Davis-White, QC, handed her a six-month suspended jail sentence.  

She was also banned from the roads for two-and-a-half years and was told to take an extended test.

The court was told that Mr Punter had been planning to take a bus home after he had problems getting into work on his first day with the Tiptree firm Max Impact. Price offered to give him a lift home but lost control of her Ford Ka shortly after they left work at 5pm on December 12 last year.  

Elizabeth Bradshaw, mitigating, said Price would be haunted for the rest of her life by her actions.  

She said: 'She is a young mother and she is absolutely devastated with the part she played in robbing another mother of her son.

'She realises the horrible situation the family of Mr Punter are in and there is genuine remorse.'

The court heard that Price was not wearing her glasses when she crashed but she later passed an eye test so it was judged not to have contributed to the tragedy.

Price will have to take an extended driving test before she is allowed on the roads again. 

Mr Punter was born in Wickford and moved to Colchester the month he died.

At the time of his death a tribute, released through Essex Police, read: 'Charles Victor Punter, known as Charlie, was a true one-off. He will be remembered as a man who would make you laugh, more often than not until there were tears running down your face.

'But there was much more to him than that. Charlie had an incredible work ethic and enthusiasm for life.

'He returned to Colchester in early December to live with his friends and embark on a new career which we have no doubt he would have succeeded in. When Charlie put his mind to something, he could achieve anything.

'He was so full of potential and his family and friends are devastated that he'll never have the chance to show us what we all knew he was capable of.'
