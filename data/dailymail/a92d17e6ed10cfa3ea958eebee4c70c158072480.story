Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has told Alan Pardew that he is not happy with his side’s performance on the pitch as the manager prepares for one of his ‘toughest days’ in the job.

The pair held talks in the wake of last Saturday’s embarrassing 4-0 drubbing at Southampton, a result which left the Magpies bottom of the Premier League.

Supporters called for Pardew to be sacked at St Mary’s and there are protests planned for Saturday’s visit of Hull City to St James’ Park.

And the United boss said: ‘We (myself and Ashley) had a long conversation on Sunday and he was obviously disappointed with the performance. He has a right to be disappointed as the owner and he relayed that to me.

‘The one thing we both agreed on was that we really needed to focus on this Saturday and try to get a win for the football club. It’s very important that certain issues - particularly the issue regarding me - have to take a bit of a back seat.

‘It’s going to be a difficult environment if we have the atmosphere we had at Southampton for long periods.’

Pardew, though, did not ask his paymaster for assurances regarding his future.

‘It didn’t really come up, if I’m honest,’ he went on.

‘If it sounds like I’m trying to fudge the issue, then I’m not. We talked about the team and a couple of things that were a problem within the team - and also about the performance.

‘He was upset about the performance and that’s what we focused on. I didn’t ask for any reassurance. All I know is that I signed a long contract here for good and bad. We’ve had some great times which seem to have been forgotten recently - and some tough days too.

‘This will be one of our toughest, although I can think of some tough days I’ve had here. The environment for the players on Saturday will probably be as tough as it’s ever been and we have to accept that, knowing that Hull will come and try to make good use of our situation.’

Pardew admits it has been a testing week with speculation surrounding his position as manager.

‘It’s not been an easy week after the events at Southampton,’ he said.

‘As manager, you have to reflect and the performance really upset me. It wasn’t a performance I was proud of in any shape or form. We’ve spoken to the group about it.

‘I’m not going to offer any excuses but we have some new players and need to make sure that, if they go behind in games, they have a better spirit as a group.

‘We didn’t get the win we needed before then so it has put added pressure on us, particularly myself, and I’m fully aware of that.’
