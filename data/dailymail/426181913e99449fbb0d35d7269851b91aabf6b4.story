The treatment of the victims of Flight MH17 has been sickening, the Prime Minister said last night.

Amid growing international outrage over delays in returning the bodies, David Cameron told the Commons that Russia must ensure the victims are repatriated as quickly as possible.

Pro-Moscow rebels are accused of looting the victims’ corpses and blocking efforts by the Ukrainian and global authorities to investigate the crash.

Anger: David Cameron blasted images of looting as a 'sickening violation of an already tragic scene'

The Prime Minister said: ‘There is anger that this could happen at all, there is anger that the murder of innocent men, women and children has been compounded by sickening reports of looting of victims’ possessions and interference with the evidence. And there is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has instead been fomented by Moscow.

‘The bodies sitting on a refrigerated train have still not been allowed to leave. And the pictures of victims’ personal belongings being gone through are a further sickening violation of this already tragic scene.’

Ten Britons were among 298 people killed when MH17 was shot out of the sky at 33,000ft as it travelled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur last Thursday.

British families accused Ukrainian separatists of treating the dead in a degrading and inhumane manner.

The bodies were exposed to 29C (84f) heat for three days before being transported nine miles on trucks and loaded into refrigerated train carriages in the rebel-held town of Torez on Sunday.

Volodymyr Groysman, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said the train left last night for government-controlled Kharkiv and would then go to the Netherlands where the bodies would be identified.

Armed separatists, however, were saying the train would be routed to Ilovaysk, another town they control.

It has been claimed that bodies have been removed from the scene by militiamen who have stopped international investigators boarding the train.

A relative of Stephen Anderson, 44, a Scottish former RAF search and rescue co-ordinator killed on MH17, said: ‘Getting that train moving is all we care about.

‘This is not about politics for us, it’s about human decency. We just want to bring Stephen home and bury him. No one seems to be taking charge or seems able to make a decision when it comes to what to do with the bodies.

‘All the relatives want is to hold funerals and grieve for their loss, but everything is on hold.

‘It’s been days and nobody can tell us when the train will move and when we can have Stephen back. That is what we find distressing. Can you imagine how it feels to know your loved one may be inside that train?’

Barry Sweeney, whose 23-year-old son Liam died in the tragedy, spoke of his distress at seeing television footage of body bags being bundled into trucks.

‘I don’t want him to be lying there somewhere where there’s nobody there to give him a good cuddle,’ he said.

The 52-year-old told ITV he just wanted his son – who was travelling to New Zealand to follow his beloved Newcastle United FC on tour – to be brought home.

He added: ‘It is horrible thinking he is in a bin bag somewhere. We are just constantly thinking, where is he?

‘The Russian rebels just do not seem to care. All the bodies need to come back, not just Liam’s.’

Jordan Withers, 22, the nephew of another victim, World Health Organisation media officer Glenn Thomas, 49, said the treatment of the bodies was ‘unbelievable’.

He told BBC Radio 4: ‘They have been loading them on to trains like cargo and it’s just degrading and inhumane. You wouldn’t treat anyone like that.

‘We’re just hoping it’ll get resolved as soon as possible and as peacefully as possible so we can get the bodies back to our families and we can give them the send off they deserve.’

Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop said yesterday: ‘I cannot imagine any other air crash in history where, days later, bodies are still laying in the field.

‘This is not a time to use bodies as hostages or pawns in a Ukrainian-Russian conflict.’

Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, whose country lost 193 people in the crash, also criticised the delays, saying: ‘We want our people back.’

Frustrated British relatives admitted they were contemplating flying out to Ukraine to speed up the process. The Foreign Office has assisted in fast tracking  passport applications.

It was not immediately known what the Malaysian team would do with the black boxes, but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data

Mr Thomas’s family said the World Health Organisation had offered to pay for the family to travel to the wartorn country.

However, as fighting continued to rage in the region yesterday, it was unclear whether they would be able to go. Intense shelling rained down in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, a city about 40 miles from the train station where the bodies had been held.

The front page of the Malaysian Star newspaper said: ‘Hand them over’, as the Muslim-majority country expressed fury that the bodies of their 43 victims had not been recovered and buried in the Islamic way.

Prime minister Najib Razak, whose step-grandmother was on the doomed plane, said his government was determined to bring back the victims’ bodies before the end of Ramadan, a fasting month hugely significant to Muslims.
