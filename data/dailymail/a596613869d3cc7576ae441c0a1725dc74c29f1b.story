A Romanian bodyguard who filmed himself showering in £20 notes has said Britain is 'racist' towards 'hard-working' immigrants doing jobs the 'indigenous population doesn't really want'.

Petre Craete, known at home as 'The Redneck with a Maserati', faced a backlash after he posted pictures of himself in a bath full of cash he claimed he earned in just four hours.

Mr Craete, who has been a bodyguard for celebrity clients including reality star Alex Reid, boasted he has more money than he can spend.

But today he said the film was made for 'a laugh' and is  upset about the 'racist attitude towards me and towards others' because he 'loves Britain'.

'I came here to work, like most of my fellow countrymen. I didn't come here to steal, to rob or to claim benefits. I am not a disease for the country. I am the cure,' he said.

Boast: Romanian bodyguard Petre Craete posted pictures of himself in a bath full of notes saying he has more cash than he can spend - today he defended himself and other immigrants

'I came to this country to stay here, to live here and to die here. I didn't come here to make money and to send it back to my country. I came here most of all because of the British ideologies and because of the freedom. Everyone is supposed to live in harmony with each other no matter what colour your skin is, what is your religion or sexual orientation. I strongly believe in freedom.

'I have never claimed benefits in my life, not even when I was entitled. From what I've seen the indigenous population doesn't really want to work low paid jobs in poor working conditions. 

'The immigrants don't really mind. They get the job. The position doesn't remain uncovered, and certainly, they pay their tax, therefore the hostilities against foreigners are totally unfounded and malicious.

'I advise all my fellow countrymen and all the immigrants coming or who are already in the UK, to work hard and to pay their tax'. 

Mr Craete, who has been a bodyguard for celebrity clients including reality star Alex Reid, used a video to boast he has more money than he can spend and filmed himself showering in bundles of £20 notes.

He said in the film: 'My biggest worry when I have a quiet moment to myself is where am I going to find a wallet big enough to take it all home with.' 

'The reality is that I've got so much money I don't know where to put it. It's enough to make you cry, in Romania I never had any money and now I have so much I can't even carry at all. I wouldn't be able to walk if I tried to stuff it in my trouser pocket'.

The Romanian said he moved to London in the past few years where he was able to get work as a bodyguard quickly graduating up to celebrity clients. 

Between 2011 and 2012 he was the bodyguard for former cage fighter Alex Reid.

He was close to  Katie Price's ex-husband  and is known to have socialised with him and Chantelle Houghton, who won the Celebrity Big Brother in 2006.

He earned his nickname The Redneck with a Maserati after was spotted driving one of the top of the range cars and living in a penthouse in the UK.

The Romanian moved to Britain and quickly became a bodyguard for reality stars like Alex Reid (pictured together)

Contrast: In the film he says: 'In Romania I never had any money and now I have so much I can't even carry at all'

Message: Mr Craete says he has more cash than he can spend and earned the cash in four hours

Today he said that the film was made for a joke but he has a serious message about how he believes foreigners are perceived in Britain. 

He said: 'Regarding the video I made...well is (sic) just a video I made for a laugh. Is (sic) not even so much money in it. Everybody can make that money if they work hard'.

'The hate of people and their racist attitude towards me and towards others made me understand that I am a happy man. I am happy because I have love in my heart for everyone even for those who hate me because my skin colour is different or because I was born in another country.

'I love England. I love the Monarchy and I would happily give my life for this country. This is now my home where I want to live until the day I'll die. Don't hate me for being at home.' 

The bodyguard is said to tell his clients he is so scary he even frightens himself when he looks in the mirror.

Petre has posted pictures of himself driving expensive cars and living in a VIP apartment.

But some have claimed that   the car belonged to one of his employers and the house also didn't belong to him.

In the cash video, from October last year, he said: 'I have a tip for my critics, if you come London buy an umbrella because it rains a lot. As every British person knows it's bad luck to open the umbrella inside a house, so I won't do it, and in my house it only rains with money anyway.'

Petre is from Targu-Jiu in Southern Romania's Gorj County. 

Alex Reid used to call him Ninja Pete and posted messages like: 'At cinema with Miss Houghton and ninja Pete. Very romantic, haha, even managed 2 get her 2 watch super hero film! X'
