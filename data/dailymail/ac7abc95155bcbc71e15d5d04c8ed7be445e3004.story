Jessica Wright found fame as one of the original TOWIE girls when hair extensions, figure-hugging bandage dresses and lashing of fake tan were all the rage.

But the reality TV star says she's had a style overhaul since finding fame and her new clothing collection reflects that.

Speaking to MailOnline as she launches her SS14 range, Jessica, 28, said: 'My new collection is different to my past offerings because I've really changed my style. When I used to look in the mirror, I didn't like what I saw and couldn't stand my look but I have totally revamped my style.'

Jessica, who once had a penchant for hair extensions, admits that she'll 'never have long hair again' and her recent shorter hair style was inspired by Tamera Foster from X Factor.

'My new hair really suits me, it's classy. I've realised I'm 28 now, not 21.

'Ultimately, to be glamorous you don't have to wear skin-tight dresses and that's why my new range focuses around knee-length dresses, sophisticated prints and tailored blazers.'

Jess has taken note of the season's catwalks and incorporated lace into her designs because it 'never goes out of fashion' and there's a big focus on co-ordinated pieces and sculpted dresses.

One customer Jessica has her eye on is her soon-to-be sister-in-law Michelle Keegan, who recently got engaged to Jessica's brother Mark.

'Michelle has such a stunning body and classy style so she will love my range and will look fabulous in my jumpsuits,' she said.

Jessica, who is currently dating co-star Ricky Rayment, said she gives her boyfriend style advice 'all the time' and has helped him 'smarten his look'. She is, however, sometimes on the receiving end of it.

'I will ask Ricky if I look nice in something but I swear he sometimes tells me I look bad when I actually look good and I'm thinking: "Are you just saying that because I actually look sexy?", she laughs.

'I don't always trust his advice. He once said I looked awful in an outfit but then it got really good reviews but he's sometimes right.'

Jessica says she often struggles to stick to a healthy eating regime and while she loves salad and vegetables, she craves sugar and biscuits 'all the time'.

Aside from her fashion duties, Jessica is currently working on her music career, which she says will be unveiled in the summer, as well as a range of fruity tans that she promises 'smell amazing and nothing like curry.'

It seems that the only way is success for Jessica.
