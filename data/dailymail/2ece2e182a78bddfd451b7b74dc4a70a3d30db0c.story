Profits: The company, which is owned by German utility firm RWE, saw profits soar by £77million from £313million but chief executive Paul Massara said the company is no more profitable than a supermarket

Profits at energy giant Npower have surged by 25 per cent to £390million just months after it imposed punishing price rises on customers.

The company, which is owned by German utility firm RWE, saw profits from its UK customers and power stations soar by £77million from £313million.

In November, it increased gas tariffs by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent, just as millions were turning on their heating to keep out the winter cold, pushing the average dual-fuel bill up by £108 to £1,352.

Bosses justified the price rise by blaming Government policy, specifically demands to support green energy through wind farms, provide free insulation to vulnerable homes, discounts for the poor and the cost of rebuilding the national network of cables and pipes.

It also argued that it had no choice but to pass on an increase in the cost of the wholesale gas it uses to run its power stations and provide central heating.

But Labour MP John Robertson, who sits on the Commons energy select committee, described Npower’s profits as ‘despicable’.

He said: ‘It is about time the energy companies stopped lying about their reasons for putting their prices up.

'They say price increases are due to Government policies and yet they proudly announce despicable profits.

'This has got to stop – they need to 
start investing in their own business, like all other businesses have to
 do, rather than ripping off struggling customers.’ 

Studies
 suggest many poorer households, including pensioners, are rationing 
their heating and going  cold because they are scared of  running up a 
bill they cannot pay.

This has consequences for the health of the elderly and sick, with thousands of additional deaths each winter because it exacerbates existing health problems.

Npower says its profit margin is around 5 per cent, suggesting it made an average profit of almost £60 from each of its 6.6million customer accounts.

The price rise helped RWE, which operates across Europe, to a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, taking the total to £5.5billion.

Yesterday, consumer campaigners urged Npower to give back some of its profit to customers by announcing an immediate price cut.

Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: ‘These profits will make customers wonder exactly why Npower had to hit them with a hefty price hike this winter.

‘Npower customers deserve a valid answer, especially those who were forced to go cold this winter for fear of the cost of heating their home.’

Last week, British Gas announced a 11 per cent rise in profits for 2012, taking its total up to £606million. Profits at parent company Centrica rose 14 per cent to £2.7billion.

Britain’s six biggest power firms insist they must make strong profits to finance £150billion of spending on rebuilding Britain’s energy supply.
