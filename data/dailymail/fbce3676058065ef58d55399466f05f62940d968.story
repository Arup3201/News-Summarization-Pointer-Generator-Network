The boss of the Victorian Comanchero bikie gang wants to stand down from his role and spend more time with his family, the supreme court has heard.

Michael James Murray, 36, is in court charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, possessing firearms and possessing testosterone after he allegedly tried to intimidate a man into taking the blame for explosives found at the house of another Comanchero.

His lawyer Philip Dunn QC argued in the Victorian supreme court for his client to be granted bail on the grounds that his trial wouldn't begin until mid-2015 and that his businesses would collapse in the meantime.

Kicking back: The Victorian boss of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle gang, on trial for perverting the course of justice, wants to step down and spend more time with his family, court heard on Monday

He told the court Mr Murray intended to resign his post as the Victorian commander of the Commanchero outlaw motorcycle gang to spend more time around his loved ones.

'He doesn't want to be in jail, he wants to be at home with his wife, his family and his business,' AAP reported Mr Dunn as telling the court on Monday.

Victorian police allegedly found vials of testosterone when they raided Murray's home in Lysterfield, in Melbourne's southeast, in February.

A second police raid the following month, at a Dewhurst property owned by his wife, allegedly uncovered a six guns, including shotguns and a pistol with tape on the handle.

The court heard the guns were buried in plastic bags near a dam at the rural property but were exposed because the dam had dried up.

Prosecutor Bill Stougiannos opposed Murray's bail application, saying he faced a serious accusation of perverting the course of justice.

He said Michael 'Mick' Murray could re-offend if he was granted bail.Â 

Lawyer Philip Dunn argued Murray's two businesses, Nitro Gym and Nitro Ink tattoo parlour, could fail if his client was behind bars.

He said Murray would submit to a curfew on bail, and a $1 million surety would be posted by an associate.

Justice Gregory Garde said he would make a decision on Murray's bail on Tuesday.

Murray has been in police custody since March after police launched a number of raids on properties around Victoria.

Almir Dzafic and Robert Morando were also charged with perverting the course of justice for allegedly pressuring a man into taking the blame for explosives found at a Comanchero member's house in March 2013.
