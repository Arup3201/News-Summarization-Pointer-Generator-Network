President Obama opened his heart about the Newtown shooting massacre today, candidly telling NBC's 'Meet the Press' during a televised morning interview that the tragedy represented the, 'worst day of my presidency.'

'The question (sic) becomes whether we are actually shook up enough by what happened here that it does not just become another one of these routine episodes where it gets a lot of attention for a couple of weeks and then drifts away,' the president told host, David Gregory. 'It certainly won't feel like that to me.

'This is something that, you know, that was the worst day of my presidency. And it's not something that I want to see repeated.'

Obama referenced an iconic Oval Office 
predecessor who also confronted entrenched and accepted traditions that 
many felt had to change in the interest of the public good

President Obama appeared on 'Meet the Press' this morning to discuss his plans for gun control across the United States in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre

Obama book ended his revelation with vows to put his 'full weight' behind the push for new 
gun control legislation aimed at avoiding another massacre of the like 
that robbed 20 first graders' - and six adults - of the their lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Dec. 14.

'It is not enough for us to say, 'This is too hard so we're not going to try,' Obama said. 'So what I 
intend to do is I will call all the stakeholders together. I will meet 
with Republicans. I will meet with Democrats. I will talk to anybody.'

When Gregory expressed skepticism he could galvanize Americans on the the issue of gun control, Obama referenced an iconic Oval Office predecessor who also confronted entrenched and accepted traditions that many felt had to change in the interest of the public good.

'This is not going to be simply a matter of me spending political capital,' Obama said. 'One of the things you learn, having now been in this office for four years, is the old adage of Abraham Lincoln's. That with public opinion there's nothing you can't do and without public opinion there's very little you can get done in this town.

'So I'm going to be
 putting forward a package and I'm going to be putting my full weight 
behind it. And I'm going to be making an argument to the American people
 about why this is important and why we have to do everything we can to 
make sure that something like what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary 
does not happen again.'

Obama's comments come as the schoolroom shooting has elevated the issue of gun violence to the forefront of public attention.

'One of the things you learn, having now 
been in this office for four years, is the old adage of Abraham 
Lincoln's. That with public opinion there's nothing you can't do and 
without public opinion there's very little you can get done in this town'

Authorities say the shooter, Adam Lanza, killed himself and also killed his mother at their home.

The
 slayings have prompted renewed calls for greater gun controls. The 
National Rifle Association has resisted those efforts vociferously, 
arguing instead that schools should have armed guards for protection.

'I
 am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools,' 
Obama said. 'And I think the vast majority of the American people are 
skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem.'

Obama said he intended to press the issue with the public.

'Will there be resistance?  Absolutely there will be resistance,' he said.

Besides
 getting gun violence legislation passed next year, Obama also listed 
immigration as a top priority for 2013 as well as deficit reduction.

A 
big deficit reduction deal with Republicans proved elusive this month 
and Obama is now hoping Senate Democratic and Republican leaders salvage
 a scaled back plan that avoids across the board tax increases for 
virtually all Americans.

skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem'

He issued a defense 
of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who has been 
mentioned as one of the leading candidates for new secretary of defense.

Hagel,
 who opposed President George W. Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq,
 has been criticized in conservative circles for not being a strong 
enough ally of Israel.

Many liberals and gay activists also have banded 
against him for comments he made in 1998 about an openly gay nominee for
 an ambassadorship

Lanza slaughtered 20 children and six adults in one of America's worst ever school shootings the week before Christmas

Obama, who briefly served 
with Hagel in the Senate, stressed that he had yet to make a decision on
 a secretary of defense but said called Hagel a 'patriot.'

'He
 is somebody who has done extraordinary work both in the United States 
Senate,' he said.

'Somebody who served this country with valor in 
Vietnam.  And is somebody who's currently serving on my intelligence 
advisory board and doing an outstanding job.'

He
 noted that Hagel had apologized for his 14-year-old remark. 'And I 
think it's a testimony to what has been a positive change over the last 
decade in terms of people's attitudes about gays and lesbians serving 
our country,' Obama said.
