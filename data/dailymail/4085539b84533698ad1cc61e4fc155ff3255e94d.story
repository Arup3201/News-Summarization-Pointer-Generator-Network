Teachers at an ‘outstanding’ sixth-form college have been accused of ‘leading’ hundreds of pupils through their A-level examinations to secure better grades.

Around 650 students will not be awarded grades after biology teachers apparently conducted experiments that were almost identical to the ones that were to appear in exam papers.

They also held in-class discussions about the experiments in preparation for the exam. Rules stipulate that pupils should not be led over what might appear in papers.

The Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, which is at the centre of an exam cheat investigation.

The AQA examination board’s 
investigation into allegations of malpractice at Runshaw College in 
Leyland, Lancashire, means that 400 AS students and 250 A-level students
will not be awarded grades when results are published next month.

Instead they will have to take home their predicted results – meaning they could miss out on their preferred university course.

All 650 students yesterday received a 
letter, which refers to a ‘misinterpretation’ of the AQA’s guidelines, 
informing them of the decision.

Leon Staffa, 18, from Blackburn, said 
he was ‘shocked’. After underperforming on his A-level module last year,
he re-took it in order to boost his grades and try to get into a 
prestigious university to study dental hygiene and therapy. ‘When I read
the letter I thought “oh no, I’m going to have to do the exam for a 
third time”,’ he said. ‘I’ve spoken to a few of my friends in the class 
and they are all shocked too.

‘I didn’t really feel any better 
prepared for that exam than in my other subjects, so to hear that 
teachers have been accused of giving us an unfair advantage is 
disappointing.’

Leon was hoping for a grade B on the 
module to try to boost his overall biology grade to an A, but said he 
would now have to ‘wait and see’.

Jack Gudgeon takes to Twitter while the college has described the incident as 'unfortunate' with 'no deliberate attempt' to cheat

Others took to the social networking 
site Twitter to express their disgust. Jack Gudgeon said: ‘Slightly 
annoyed with Runshaw is a bit of an understatement right now.’ Andy Fong
described the situation as a ‘joke’.

The college – rated ‘outstanding’ by 
Ofsted for 20 consecutive years – scored a 100 per cent pass rate last 
year. In 2012, 70 per cent of A-level students achieved grades A* to B. 
Principal Kathy Passant, 55, who is retiring this summer after four 
years at the helm, claims that made  it the country’s best sixth-form 
college. It is continually oversubscribed.

The college has described the incident
as ‘unfortunate’ and its own inquiry concluded that there was ‘no 
deliberate attempt’ to cheat.

A spokesman said its science teachers 
were advised by the exam board that they could run similar experiments 
in class to prepare students for practical exams.

‘Unfortunately, it appears that the 
biology team misinterpreted what they were allowed to do to,’ said the 
spokesman. ‘They ran similar (but not identical) experiments to those on
the real exams; however, the exam board has judged that the experiments
and the subsequent in-class group discussion activities gave our 
students an unfair advantage over students in other centres.’

The college is introducing additional independent checks on exam preparations.
