Reality TV stars attended a party at the Big Brother house to celebrate The National Trust's controversial move to open the iconic building to the public.

Model Sophie Anderton and cage fighter Alex Reid were among the many former housemates to take a trip down memory lane.

Reid, 38, the ex-husband of media personality Katie Price, said he was thrilled to return to the site of his win in 2010.

He said: 'The night before coming in I had second thoughts but I knew I had to do it. I wanted to be known as an actor and an athlete but I was known for my sex life.

'When I came in I treated it like a fight and turned boos into cheers,' he told the Daily Star.

2007 winner Brian Belo also attended, comparing the site to an exclusive private school.

He said: 'It's surreal really. I feel like I'm an old Etonian visiting the school again.'

Visitors will be able to have a look around the house at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, for just two days. The 500 tickets sold out within 12 minutes.

However, the plan to open up the Big Brother house was criticised by former MP Ann Widdecombe who said she was 'saddened' by the move.

The former politician believes the Trust should concentrate on properties which had 'stood the test of time'.

The property with its ever-changing 
decor has been home to figures such as Vinnie Jones, Ivana Trump and 
Vanessa Feltz who have taken part in Celebrity Big Brother over the 
years. 

The
National Trust’s London director Ivo Dawnay said: 'The fact that the 
housemates’ residence is not, say, a sublime late Robert Adam country 
house does not necessarily make it less interesting.

'The great houses of our past reflected the tastes of the day and so does the Big Brother House.'

The National Trust admitted the scheme to open the house up was just a bit of light-hearted fun

The house has undergone many changes during its 13-year history

He added: 'Our tongues are not a million miles from our cheeks - unusual for an organisation not most famous for its sense of humour. We hope that by opening the Big Brother house we are paving the way to an altogether wittier future.'

But Miss Widdecombe - a former contestant on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing - told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I’m rather saddened by this.

'I’m a member of the National Trust and I’m not going to be burning my membership card because of this, but I don’t think it’s part of the National Trust’s mission.'

Miss Widdecombe said she accepted that the Trust should update its portfolio and not 'just wholly go for historic homes', but questioned whether it should be getting involved with the Big Brother house, rather than BBC Television Centre, which is due for redevelopment.

'I do think something has to stand the test of time before you can seriously call it heritage,' she said.

'I don’t think it needs to be tawdry and celebrity-obsessed. There’s lots of candidates around that I think you could choose for this sort of exercise.'

'Even Prime Ministers have discovered in their time that trying to make things look more trendy can upset people who are pretty loyal.'
