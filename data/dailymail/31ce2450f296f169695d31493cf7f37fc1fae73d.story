At the end of Arsenal's 1-0 win over Southampton on Wednesday, the spotlight focused on Arsene Wenger's strikeforce.

How can he get Danny Welbeck to improve after missing a host of chances against Saints? How much longer can he rely on Alexis Sanchez to get Arsenal out of jail? Should he get Thierry Henry at the club as a coach, passing on his expertise, as soon as possible? 

Everyone, it seemed, had forgotten about one of the World Cup winners missing from Arsenal's ranks. 

Mesut Ozil watched Arsenal beat Southampton  and gave his approval of the result by saying 'job well done'

But playmaker Mesut Ozil watched his team break down Ronald Koeman's side and while the performance had plenty of room for improvement, the result got his seal of approval.

'Job well done' he put, alongside a picture of him watching the game wrapped up in a blanket as winter sets in across England.

Ozil was ruled out of action for 12 weeks with a knee injury at the start of October and Arsenal will no doubt be hoping he can return to top form when he returns in the new year.
