Celebrities including Wag Coleen Rooney are well-known for bragging about their other halves on social media. Earlier this month, Coleen Tweeted a selfie of her and husband Wayne on their wedding anniversary with the comment: 'Six years ago today I became Mrs Rooney! Through all the good times and some bad... We are stronger than ever.'

But while such public declarations of affection might make boost your partner's ego, they won't help your own popularity, according to new research.

A study published in the Science of Relationships found that people who posted pictures of themselves and their partners looking lovey dovey, or who made gushing status updates about their other half, were disliked by their friends.

So in love, so annoying: Selfies with your partner and gushing updates, like this one recently posted by Coleen Rooney, are disliked

It seems frequently boosting about your love - which can also be done by changing your relationship status on Facebook - is a means of making your friends mad.

This is what the researchers discovered for their paper which will be published in the journal Personal Relationships.

They asked more than 200 people who were in relationships to give them access to their Facebook profile. They found that more than a quarter had profile pictures showing them with their partner and 70 per cent had changed their relationship status to reflect their love life.

The researchers were then asked to judge how satisfied and committed they thought each person was in their relationship, based on their Facebook profile.

Spare us! Researchers found people disliked status updates were people talked too much about their partner

Those who had profile pictures with their partners and who displayed their relationship status were deemed to have 'higher quality' relationships.

Each of the people who had shared their Facebook pages with the researchers were also asked to answer a questionnaire on how satisfied they were in their relationship.

The answers reflected the assumptions the researchers had made based on the Facebook profiles - the people who had pictures with their partners and shared their relationship status were found to be the most satisfied and committed based on their questionnaire answers.

Therefore the researchers concluded that a relationship is perceived to be 'better' if someone makes a show of it on their Facebook page.

However, the next part of their study found it doesn't make you a better friend.

The researchers next created a variety of fictional Facebook profiles, with some using profile pictures of couples and displaying their current relationship status.

What does your profile say about your relationship? Those who had a profile picture with the partner were deemed to be more content

They also made up status updates revealing various levels of disclosure about their fictional relationship.

High disclosure included status updates such as 'Pining away for Jordanâ€¦ I just love you so much I can't stand it!'

Coleen's Tweet as above would also fall under 'high disclosure' category.

Low disclosure included statuses that were about a relationship but impersonal eg 'I love my girlfriend' while no relationship disclosure covered statuses like 'I've lost my mobile, email me'.

People were then asked to judge each fictional Facebook profile and decide which were the most satisfied in their relationship. They were also asked to rate how much they liked the person whose profile they were viewing.

Once again, those with profile pictures of their partners who displayed their relationship status were judged to be the most satisfied.

However, those who disclosed too much about their relationship in their status updates were the least popular.

Those who had the most 'high disclosure' status updates were particularly disliked.

So postings like Coleen's may make people perceive a relationship as successful - but that doesn't mean they'll like you for it.
