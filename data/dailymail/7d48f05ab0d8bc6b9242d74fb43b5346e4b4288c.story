West Brom are working with police to identify supporters seen in a video appearing to let off fire extinguishers and throwing objects inside Villa Park during Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa.

The match, which Tim Sherwood's side won 2-0 to secure a place in the semi-final of the competition, was marred by supporter disturbances before, during and after the encounter.

'We are aware of the video footage and are working with police and the club's own security personnel to identify the culprits, who will face appropriate action,' a West Brom spokesman said on Monday.

Aston Villa have not commented on the footage.

The two-and-a-half minute long video shows supporters appearing to spray foam from fire extinguishers over each other and throwing what seems to be an empty bin around in the food and drink area inside the stand.

The FA announced earlier on Monday it has contacted both clubs for their observations in relation to the crowd incidents and is also liasing with West Midlands police.

Fans ran onto the pitch before full time and seats were thrown from the North Stand, where the away fans were situated.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis has already been quick to condemn the scenes, calling for any supporters who are found guilty of throwing seats to receive lifetime bans.
