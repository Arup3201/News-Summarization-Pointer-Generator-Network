President Barack Obama may have become used to wearing golf shoes after spending the weekend hitting the links in the Sunshine State.

The Commander-in-Chief, returning from a Florida trip where he played golf with wealthy donors, nearly took a tumble when exiting Air Force One on Sunday.

He gave a wave to media before stumbling for a second and resuming his trot down to the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.

Obama kicked off the spring season at the resort where he once caused a stir by playing with Tiger Woods and had no official events scheduled.

First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were not on the trip at the Floridian National Golf Club in Palm City, less than 50 miles up the coast from Palm Beach.  

The president's Sunday also featured a golf game with Houston Astros owner Jim Crane, who is a major Democratic party donor with a net worth estimated at $2billion.

The pair's foursome was joined by Mitch Carroll, who is on the board of directors at oil company Halliburton, and private equity investor Glenn Hutchins, part owner of the Boston Celtics. 

Obama flew out of the airport in Fort Pierce, where he arrived before making the short trip to Palm City.

The president also took time to reconnect with Florida pizza shop owner Scott Van Duzer, who famously gave Obama a bear hug in 2012.

Local media reported the president teed off Saturday with former NBA star Alonzo Mourning, former NFL star and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad and Cyrus Walker, a cousin of Obama's senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, according to WPTV.  

Two years ago, Obama played 18 holes at the Floridian with Woods and Crane, who owns the club. He also practiced with Woods' former swing coach.  

Word of Obama's golf game with Woods in 2013 came initially from a professional sports journalist who was on the course and tweeted about it, even though the White House had prohibited the traveling press corps from observing Obama on the course.

Like last time, the White House arranged for the reporters covering the president to wait at a separate location on the property where Obama won't be visible. 

According to local paper TCPalm, Obama was also expected to play the 18-hole course with Woods’ former coach instructor Butch Harmon.

Controversial: Two years ago, Obama caused a stir during a visit to the same Florida golf resort by closing the course off from the press. It was then revealed he was having private lessons with Tiger Woods

Previous administrations have allowed brief news media coverage during presidential rounds of golf. 

Obama's policy generally is not to allow reporters to observe him.  

He has made a few exceptions when he's golfed with prominent figures, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, former President Bill Clinton and the leaders of New Zealand and Malaysia.

The Federal Aviation Administration  issued flight restrictions in a ten-mile area over the Palm City area for the entire weekend.
