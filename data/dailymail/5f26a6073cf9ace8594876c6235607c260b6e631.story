Roberto Martinez insists he is under no pressure to fit John Stones into Everton’s team following his promotion to the England starting line-up.

Stones has only made one start for Everton this season - at Leicester on the opening day - but he began both England’s recent fixtures against Norway and Switzerland.

Everton handed Stones a new long-term contract last month and Martinez has stated the 20-year-old defender’s progress with the national team is good for his club.

 ‘It’s only a positive when I see John playing for England,’ said Martinez. ‘It gives me a real insight as to what he is as a personality. John is impressive with the way he copes with big events.

‘We saw that with some of the games he played last season with us, especially against the top teams. You see him perform in the way he did against Norway but then, even with the pressure the England team have in their first qualifier, he is impressive.’ 

Martinez, whose side face West Brom on Saturday, added: ‘John is a young man and I’m going to measure his playing time because he is still developing as a young player and needs help in that respect.

‘It helps when you see John going with England and playing as he did. That will always bring a success to our team. It’s not about playing every game, it’s about what the players need, and I do feel John will have a massive role this season with us.’
