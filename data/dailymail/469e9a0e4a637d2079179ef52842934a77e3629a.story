Police have obtained surveillance footage of missing Oregon mother Jennifer Huston withdrawing cash from a local bank before heading to the gas station where she was last seen.

The 38-year-old mother-of-two was caught on cameras alone at a credit union in Newburg at around 6pm last Thursday, The Oregonian reported.

Ten minutes later, she was captured on cameras at a nearby 76 gas station. After buying gas, her dark green Lexus LX-470 was seen driving off with only her inside - the last sighting of her.

She has not used her credit cards since and her cell phone has been switched off, police said.

Have you seen her? Jennifer Huston, 38, vanished as she ran errands last Thursday. Police have surveillance footage of her taking out cash and then buying petrol - but she has not been seen since

Authorities have not said how much money she withdrew from the bank, only saying it was a small amount.

Huston had left her home in Dundee to run
 errands and never returned home to her husband and their two sons, aged
 two and six. Her husband, Kallen Huston, reported her missing on July 
25.

He has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't see a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car.

'I ask that anybody helping us, regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the side of the highways,' he said.

'See if you can tell if shrubs are 
disrupted, maybe small trees knocked down where it would appear as if a 
car had driven off or crashed. Her car is fairly large so it would make a
 pretty good hole... Look to see if maybe her car is tucked away behind a
 garage or something.

'I have the feeling she's in a ditch somewhere.'

He added: 'his is totally unlike her. She's a devoted mother. Sheâ€™s just a very good person, and for her to do something like this is completely out of the norm.'

Her parents have also begged anyone who has any information as to her whereabouts to get in touch.

Her
 father, Bill Turner, said he and wife Deborah, were 'scared to death 
... absolutely scared to death' over the mystery of her disappearance.

'She's
 a bright, vibrant person. She's a loving mom,' Turner said. 'She looked
 like she could be a model. She's the person who everyone will gravitate
 to and will want to talk to.'

Speaking
 of his daughter's marriage, he added: 'The best way to describe the 
relationship, the way my wife describes it, is two old souls living 
together.'

He added that there were no conflicts at home, and that she would 'never leave her boys. She is an amazing mom and woman.'

 Police Captain Jeff 
Kosmicki says police - who have been trying to 'ping' her phone hourly 
for three days in a bid to get a location - have exhausted all leads.

The
 family created a Facebook page, Find Jennifer Huston, to share 
photographs and information, sparking a massive social media campaign to
 find her under the Twitter hashtag #findjenniferhuston.

According to a family flier, Huston 
was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and yoga pants. She is 
5-foot-7-inches tall and has blond shoulder-length hair and blue eyes.

Anybody with information that may lead to finding Mrs Huston are urged to call their local police station immediately.
