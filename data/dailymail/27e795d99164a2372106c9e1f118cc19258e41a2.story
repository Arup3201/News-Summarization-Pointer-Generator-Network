Favelas are often associated with Brazil - the dangerous slums that perch high on the hills around Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo.

But Portugal has its own answer to the favelas of Brazil - Cova da Moura - a drug-trafficker's haven that has become a magnet for tourists. 

Around 1,000 tourists a year, including academics, architects and sociologists, are now willing to pay the five euro price for a tour of the slum's narrow, history-filled streets.

However, taxi drivers still refuse to venture into the what was once one of Europe's most dangerous slums after dark. 

Inspired by the favela circuits launched in Brazil in recent years, the visits have a twin goal: 'to clean up the neighbourhood's image as a drug and crime haven, and give the local economy a boost,' said Miguel Lourenco, who runs the tourism project 'Sabura'.

'This isn't Montmartre or Barcelona's Gothic quarter, but our cultural heritage can take visitors into the world of Cape Verde, its food, crafts and music.'

A third of residents are made up of Cape Verdeans.  

Tour guide Reginaldo Spinola, 27, explains: 'This is a little village of 7,000 people - everyone knows everyone else.'

The first to settle the hill above Lisbon were Portuguese returning from the colonies. But after Cape Verde's independence in 1975, they were joined by a mass influx of immigrants who built homes there illegally.

Along with men and women from former colonies Angola and Guinea Bissau, they flocked to Portugal at a time when it was hungry for cheap labour.

Forty years on, with the economic crisis biting hard, Cova da Moura is plagued with unemployment. Those who have work struggle as badly paid labourers or cleaners.

'A lot of young people sell drugs to put food on their families' tables,' said Spinola. 

Cova da Moura is often likened to the favelas of Brazil and the townships of South Africa

Others - armed with Portuguese qualifications - have headed home to Cape Verde, even though life there is now twice as expensive as Portugal.

Godelieve Meersschaert first came to Cova da Moura from Belgium in 1982, as a young psychologist looking for a new experience.

'I liked the neighbourhood, and I'm still here,' she said.

Together with her husband Eduardo, originally from the Azores islands, she founded an association called Moinho da Juventude - Mill of Youth - which has been working to improve local living conditions, including fighting for access to running water and sewage.

The soft-spoken 69-year-old is on a mission to save Cova da Moura from demolition.

'Ten years ago, city hall wanted to tear down the neighbourhood and offer the land up to property developers. It is very well located, at the gates of Lisbon.

'They organised a campaign of slander on television to get people worked up against us,' she said.

So from there came the idea of opening up the area to tourists, to show another side of Cova da Moura. 

Police raids are frequent by night, but Cova da Moura is considered safe to visit - with a local guide - after sunrise, and the gangs seem to have reached a tacit decision to leave the tourists alone.

One dealer even had an abortive go at a new career as a tour guide - before he was sent to jail for driving without a licence.

Judging by the German tourists' reaction as they clap and cheer to a local rap video shot to denounce police violence - the PR operation is a success.

For Sabine Oster, a pharmacist from Frankfurt, the tours 'show you the other side of Lisbon, instead of just visiting the same old monuments.'

'Exploring Cova da Moura is more than worthwhile,' she said.
