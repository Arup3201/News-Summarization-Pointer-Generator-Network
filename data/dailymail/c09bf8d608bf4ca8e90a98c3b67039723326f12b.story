A huge family tree linking 13 million people could solve some longstanding mysteries about how some human traits are influenced by genes.

A team of researchers at Cambridge, Massachusetts, looked at 43 million public profiles on the genealogy website Geni.com.

Public profiles on this site, which include that of Kate Middleton and Barack Obama, reveal information such as location, birth dates and family links.

A team of researchers at Cambridge, Massachusetts looked at 43 million public profiles on the genealogy website Geni.com which is run by MyHeritage

Dr Yaniv Erlich and his team at the Whitehead Institute constructed the world’s largest family tree from the data, which stretches back to the 15th Century.

'Using this information, we constructed a single pedigree of 13 million individuals spanning many generations up to the 15th century and validated its quality using unilineal Y chromosome and mitochondira markers,' the authors wrote in the abstract to their study. 

The research has not yet been published, but as a proof of concept, the team analysed the immigration patterns of individuals in these family trees, displaying them graphically in a time lapse.

FamiLinx is a scientific resource of genealogical and demographic data from tens of millions of people mostly from the last 500 years.

The starting point of FamiLinx was the public information on Geni.com, a genealogy-driven social network that is operated by MyHeritage.

Geni.com allows genealogists to enter their family trees into the website and to create profiles of family members.

'The main advantage of FamiLinx is its ultra-large pedigrees. The largest pedigree has 13 million individual,' claims the site. 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest pedigree compiled for scientific studies.

‘It’s interesting to see the correlation between historical events and migration partners,’ Dr Erlich told MailOnline. 

'For instance, we know the Mayflower arrived in 1620 to New England and we can see this in our data.’

Anyone can log online and contribute their details to the website, but it may take a while before the results are condensed into useful information for genetic scientists.

The names have been stripped from the data to protect privacy.

‘We have given the anonymous data to the wider scientific community to use in their projects,’ Dr Erlich said.

‘There may be someone out there who can find things out from our data that we’ve missed.’

The changes in certain traits can show how much a human characteristic is linked to genetics

Previous data available for genetic studies contained hundreds of thousands of family members at best.

The work, presented by computational biologist Dr Erlich at the American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting in Boston, could aid in the understanding of how genes contribute to certain traits.

Even more useful, however, is the possibility that this gene information could be linked to medical information.

By comparing someone to their ancestors, the degree of change in certain traits can reveal how much that characteristic is linked to genetics.

However, Dr Erlich admitted that the self-reported genealogical data may not be completely accurate.

‘We are not confident that it is all correct,’ he said. ‘…the end point of this process is to advance our biomedical knowledge and data such as this can be hugely valuable.’
