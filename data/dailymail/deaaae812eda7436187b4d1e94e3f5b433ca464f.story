Rule number one about pulling off a successful heist is that you don't tell anyone - and you definitely don't post a picture of yourself online with all the stolen goods.

Unfortunately, this rule was lost on one hapless opportunist, who posted a picture of himself on Facebook with various items - suggesting that he stole them from vandalised stores during the week's rioting.

It was one of the more astounding posts that police claim encouraged violence and theft across the capital over the weekend and early this morning.

Police also say sites such as Twitter - as well as BlackBerry handsets - were used to co-ordinate attacks on police and tell potential rioters where to find violence hotspots.

BlackBerry handsets, owned by more 
than a third of British teenagers, allow users to send one-to-many 
messages to their network of contacts, connected by BlackBerry Messenger
 PIN codes.

Unlike conventional texts or calls, as well as Twitter or Facebook, many BlackBerry messages are untraceable by the authorities.

Hundreds of people on Twitter posted pictures of a burning police car and evidence of looting, with many showing their approval of the violence and vandalism and encouraging others to join in.

Police say that many of the tweets have pictures of the violence in a show of bravado, and have now warned that identified Twitter users could face arrest for inciting violence.

Deputy
 Assistant Commissioner Stephen Kavanagh confirmed officers were looking
 at the website as part of investigations into widespread looting and 
rioting.

A two-minute film of a police car
 being trashed by rioters was posted on YouTube to a rap soundtrack. The
 clip finished with the words: 'The enemy isn't your own people, the 
enemy is the police.'

Looter: Pictures put on Twitter showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including TVs and mobile phones

Police are scrutinising tweets and 
messages on internet forums and could press charges if they consider 
they amount to incitement to riot.

Metropolitan Police Commander Adrian 
Hanstock said: 'There 
has been some speculation on social media sites and we are actively 
posting accurate information to correct this.

'What we would ask for is if anyone 
has information about those who committed these offences or anyone 
intending to, then please let us know.'

Police say there was clear evidence of rioters 
co-ordinating their attacks using the social networking site, stirring 
up emotions against the police and urging others to join in the 
violence.

Tweets 
reported specific locations of clashes with police. One, from a user 
calling himself 'English Frank', seemed to be encouraging rioters to 
kill police officers.

Stirring up emotion: Pictures of burning police cars were put on sites such as Twitter and YouTube, with many comments revelling in the damage caused and carrying anti-authority sentiments

The tweet read: 'Everyone up and roll to Tottenham f*** the 5-0. I hope 1 dead tonight.'

Another Twitter user, 'Sonny Twag', tweeted: 'Want to roll Tottenham to loot. I do want a free TV. Who wudn't.'

Yet
 another, 'DannyWonders', tweeted: 'Jewellry Shop In Green Lanes Getting
 Robbed Right In Front Of My Eyes<looool get involved!'

Shops selling luxury goods were the obvious targets of the looters. 
Police said the majority of opportunistic thieves were young - aged in 
their teens and early twenties.

Mobile
 phone and jewellery shops were damaged and plundered amid the violence,
 and at least one Twitter image showed a young man wheeling a trolley 
full of looted goods.

Looting quickly spread in Tottenham, with high-street giants Currys, Argos, Comet and PC World the most popular among thieves.

The Barclays Bank branch in 
Tottenham High Road was targeted, with rioters smashing their way into 
the branch and its cashpoint machine ripped from the wall and emptied.

But Twitter was also being used to warn 
people away from the area, with many tweets telling peaceful residents 
of the affected areas to keep away from flashpoints.

Despite the quickly escalating violence, the protest had begun peacefully.

Family and friends of Mark Duggan, the father-of-four shot dead by police on Thursday night, had marched from the 
Broadwater Farm estate to Tottenham police station to demand answers.

They arrived at about 5.15pm on Saturday, but were made to wait for hours before anyone addressed them.

When an officer finally emerged, he said a more senior policeman would have to answer their questions.

As night fell around 8pm, the crowd had doubled and younger
 men sporting hoodies and covering their faces began to arrive on the 
back of the rumours that a 16-year-old girl had been attacked by police.

Some
 witnesses claimed she approached officers to ask questions, but then 
threw stones at them and one struck her to the ground with a baton.

One
 local said: 'There was a stand-off with the police which was tense, but
 not violent. But this changed when an officer hit a woman with a baton.

She was very 
distressed and it angered the crowd who started throwing rocks, pint 
glasses and poles at the police. Then it all got really out of hand.'

Police yesterday said they were aware of an incident when a teenage girl was asked to leave the area but said no baton was used.

Inferno: Flames rage through the Carpetright building in Tottenham on Saturday night, with fire crews prevented from tackling it in case they were attacked by rioters

With
 tensions fraying, the Duggan family group, which included his fiancee Semone
 Wilson, and friends, decided to leave as some youths started smashing 
and burning two police cars.

It soon turned into a full-scale pitched battle, spilling out along Tottenham High Road.

By
 11pm a double-decker bus was in flames, and crowds gathered to jeer 
police. Shops were smashed, including a Carpetright and Aldi supermarket
 which were both set alight.

Scores of youths were seen walking up and down the streets with TVs, stereos, mobile phones and food – all stolen.

Others were posing in front of burnt-out cars for photos and some were even getting snaps showing off their loot.

Through the night, rioters and 
looters littered the streets. The violence spread to Wood Green, Enfield
 and Brixton, where more shops were smashed, cars burned 
and goods stolen.

As the violence escalated, further tweets inflated the situation.

One said: 
'F*** the electronics, them Turkish jewellers needed to get robbed.' And
 a post on an internet forum simply read: 'Everything must go.'

Photographs
 of looters pushing 
shopping trolleys full of stolen goods - and one incredibly brazen 
looter posing with his booty, his face clearly identifiable - were also 
posted online.

In all, the looting carried on  unabated for three hours before any control was regained by police.

Stores including Boots, JD Sports, 
O2, Curry's, Argos, Orange, PC World and Comet at a shopping centre in 
Tottenham Hale were hit badly, as looters swiped anything they could, 
including breaking into cash registers.

Yesterday Tottenham High Road 
remained awash with thieves who even queued patiently to steal clothes 
from a sports shop. Police chiefs admitted that they were too stretched 
to prevent it, and said there were fears for the safety of officers.

Metropolitan Police Commander 
Hanstock said: 'Our priority will always be to try to preserve life, and
 with the numbers of people on the street and violence being directed at
 the police and fire service this had to remain our priority.

'We are aware that a number of shops were looted and this is very regrettable.'
