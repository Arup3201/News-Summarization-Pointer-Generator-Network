A British man was killed when the pilot of a light aircraft - who was banned from flying commercially - suffered an epileptic fit and crashed from 10,000ft into the Pacific Ocean.

Ian Lovell, 35, had been enjoying the holiday of a lifetime with his Australian girlfriend, Samantha Hare, 32, when the tragedy struck off the Australian coast in 2008.

Ms Hare had bought the breathtaking flight across picturesque Morton Bay and Stradbroke Island in  Queensland as a birthday present for her boyfriend.

What she did not know was that the pilot of the $492 flight, 60-year-old Barry Hempel, who also died in the incident, had been stripped of his commercial license after breaching a string of aviation rules in 2001.

An inquest at Queensland Coroner's Court Friday heard that Hempel had continued to fly his own private aircraft despite the commercial ban.

It emerged during the hearing that Hempel was known to Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority as suffering from epileptic fits, but they allowed him to keep his private pilot's license regardless.

On August 31, 2008 - six days after turning 35 - Mr Lovell climbed on board the two-seater aircraft with Hempel.

But 13 minutes into the flight Hempel suffered an epileptic fit in the cockpit and plunged the Yak-52 Warbird into the Pacific Ocean.

A horrified Ms Hare watched the drama from the shoreline.

Brisbane Coroner John Hutton slammed the Civil Aviation Authority and said it was 'unbelievable' that Hempel was still allowed to keep his private license.

He said: 'It is unbelievable that CASA did not act.

'Queensland Ambulance Service's report ought to have put CASA on red alert as to Barry Hempel’s ability to fly.

'It is also unbelievable that when Dr Ian Maxwell was briefed to assess Barry Hempel, a copy of this report was never provided to him, nor was he advised as to the admissions as to two previous seizures.

'During the inquest it became obvious that CASA medical officers were cavalier in respect to the reports and CASA medical officers chose to disregard the observations of trained paramedics.'

The court heard Hempel had not reported any problem to air traffic control but a frantic Ian could be shouting to the lifeless pilot in the last cockpit recording.

In the accidentally transmitted message an extremely upset Mr Lovell can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, what are you doing? Put it up.'

Medical evidence showed that Hempel died from injuries caused by the impact itself but had not braced himself before hitting the water, suggesting he was unconscious.

An autopsy found there was 'gross evidence' that Hempel, a pilot of 40 years, had a prior injury and scarring which could cause seizures.

As his commercial, transport and commercial helicopter licence had been cancelled this meant he was not allowed to take paying customers in the air.

After the hearing, Mr Lovell's mother 
Lynn, 59, said the coroner’s report had brought the family closure after
 five years of campaigning.

Speaking from the family home she shares with husband David, 62, in Shifnal, Shropshire, she said: 'It’s something that should never, ever have happened. Something has got to happen, this can’t happen to another family.

'Hempel had no regard for anybody. He was a maverick, a cowboy and a liar - everything you wouldn’t want to know in a person.

'Sam bought the ticket along with Ian’s friend. They thought it would be something he would like to do.

'He wasn’t a daredevil. He knew that Sam had researched the flight. He didn’t go into things lightly.

'The register is the one thing that really needs chasing up. Sam will pursue that and make sure something is being done.

'She is angry at CASA. We are angry at CASA.'

Girlfriend Samantha - who is suing the two CASA doctors responsible for medically clearing Hempel for $955,000 - added: 'None of this brings Ian back. Recommendations can be put forward but Ian is gone.

'I’m angry really. When it comes down to it CASA is the regulatory body and they did nothing to stop Barry from flying.

'I think there needs to be a better way for people to be able to check what kind of licences pilots hold.

'What he did in flying Ian was illegal and he had had his commercial licence suspended but CASA actually gave him the freedom.'

Mr Lovell had been working in Australia following his dream of combining travel with his work as a computer games animator.

He had just completed his most high-profile project, working for Chrome Industries on the Star Wars computer game, before he died.

A spokesman for CASA said the organisation would 'carefully be considering' the recommendations.
