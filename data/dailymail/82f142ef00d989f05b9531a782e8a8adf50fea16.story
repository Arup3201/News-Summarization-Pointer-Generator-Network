A member of a notorious gang that escaped from a Texas prison is scheduled for execution this week for killing a suburban Dallas police officer.

The murder took place more than 14 years ago when the seven fugitives held up a sporting good store in Huntsville, Texas.

Donald Newbury, 52, on Wednesday evening would be the third member of the 'Texas 7' to be executed since they were hunted down in Colorado six weeks after pulling off the largest prison escape in Texas.

The gang broke out of the Connally Unit in South Texas in December 2000.

Attorneys for Newbury have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to put off his lethal injection.

A 29-year-old Irving police officer, Aubrey Hawkins, was gunned down as the gang robbed the store late on Christmas Eve in 2000.

Last week the state of Ohio postponed the execution of seven death row inmates following several botched lethal injection killings across the country last year.

Two of the other Texas 7 have already been executed, three others are awaiting execution and one committed suicide before being captured by law enforcement. 

Michael Anthony Rodriguez and George Angel Rivas have already been executed, Joseph Garcia, Randy Ethan Halprin and Patrick Murphy are awaiting execution.

Larry James Harper killed himself at the time of the escape. 

Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (DRC) said it had put a hold on the executions while it secured new lethal injection drugs.

Earlier this month, the department revised its drug protocol following the bungled January 2014 execution of Dennis McGuire, who appeared to be gasping for air during the process that lasted 26 minutes, instead of the expected 10 minutes.

The drug cocktail used to kill McGuire included the sedative midazolam, which is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and has been used in several bungled executions in the United States.
