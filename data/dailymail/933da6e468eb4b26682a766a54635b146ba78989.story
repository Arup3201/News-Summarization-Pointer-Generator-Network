The Transportation Security Administration is directing valet attendants to search parked cars for explosives at a New York airport, according to a report by local television station News10NBC. 

Traveler Laurie Iacuzza recently flew out of Greater Rochester International Airport and upon returning from her trip, she found a yellow slip of paper inside her valet-parked car that announced her vehicle had been searched. 

'Thank you for your patronage,' the slip of paper read. 'Your vehicle has been inspected under TSA regulations.'

TSA has not responded to MailOnline's inquiries about the searches.

According to TSA policy, agents or 
people directed and trained by the TSA can carry out vehicle screenings 
in secure areas if they are random and drivers are notified that their 
cars could be searched.

There are no reports of valet-parked cars being inspected at other airports across the country, though many other airports have policies that allow for vehicle screenings.

The Miami International Airport notes on its website that 'all vehicles entering [the airport premises] may be inspected, as well as baggage in the vehicle.'

Similarly, the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, Michigan states on its website that 'vehicles entering the terminal curbside or parking facilities may be subject to inspection.'

The TSA has additional screening authority through its Visible Intermodal Prevention Response program, or VIPR, which is authorized by the Department of Homeland Security.

The program allows TSA to work with law enforcement officials to 'augment security of any mode of transportation' - which translates to a surge in screenings on highways, in train stations, at airports, or other transportation hubs.

The program caused outrage two years ago when it was used to inspect vehicles on highways in Tennessee and again last year when it was used to screen Amtrak passengers' luggage.

John McCaffrey, federal security director for the Rochester airport, confirmed that the cars were being searched

News10NBC talked to John McCaffrey, 
federal security director for the Rochester airport, who confirmed that 
cars were being searched. He said only valet-parked cars are subject to 
inspection because those vehicles spend time directly in front of the 
airport.

'Those 
vehicles that are in the garage, short-term [and] long-term parking, 
even if they carry pretty large amounts of explosives, they would not 
cause damage to the front of the airport,' he said.

'But for those who use the valet, the car could be there for a half hour or an hour so there is a vulnerability.'

The
television station spoke to a valet attendant who said that he and his 
coworkers - not TSA agents - had been ordered to search the cars.

'I have to,' he said, adding that the directive came about a month ago.

Iacuzza said the sign was not displayed when she dropped her car off and that she is 'furious' that her vehicle was searched without warnin.

'They never mentioned it to me when I booked the valet or when I picked up the car or when I dropped it off,' she said.
