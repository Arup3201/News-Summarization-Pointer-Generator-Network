The Real Madrid star played almost 60 games for club and country last season and admits he needed a rest towards the end.

But with Madrid involved in the La Liga title race until the final weeks of the season – before finishing third behind Atletico Madrid and Barcelona – and then playing in the Champions League final a week later.

And with just 18 days between the Champions League final in Lisbon and Portugal’s World Cup warm-up game with Ireland on June 11, Ronaldo did not have much time to recover after a long season.

He told World Soccer: 'Yes, I put my career in danger by playing in the Champions League final in Lisbon. You don't win anything in life if you don't take any risks.

'We were involved in some major competitions and things were complicated. In the end, it all worked out well. I beat the goal scoring record in the Champions League.

Portugal captain Ronaldo took part in this year's World Cup despite not being 100 per cent fit 

'It took a lot of my body to play in the Champions League final and then at the World Cup. It would have been good had I had the chance to take a break. But you don't want to miss out on the Champions League final and the World Cup.

'I wasn't in the best condition, but I pushed through. Things went well at club level. We won the final, I scored and the club at last got the Decima, which was what we had all been waiting for. With Portugal, things didn't go as well.

'I rested while on holiday after the World Cup and took good care of my body. Every now and then, I push my body to the max, like every other athlete...'

And the post-World Cup break seems to have done Ronaldo the world of good as he has returned this season in excellent form, scoring 13 goals in just six La Liga games for Madrid.
