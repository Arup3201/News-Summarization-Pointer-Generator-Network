An 18-year-old Pennsylvania man has been arrested for allegedly raping a 5-year-old female relative and infecting her with an STD.

According to the Upper Darby Police Department, Luis Arevelo sexually assaulted the child in his room several months ago.

On Tuesday, the little girl was taken by her mother to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where doctors determined that the 5-year-old was suffering from chlamydia – a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system.

Vile crime: Luis Arevelo, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, has been charged with rape of a child and indecent sexual assault for allegedly having sex with a 5-year-old female relative  

When police officers responded to the hospital and interviewed the 5-year-old's mother, the woman reportedly admitted that her daughter had previously come to her saying that Arevelo 'stuck his pee pee in her private parts.'

Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said that the child anatomically knew that the term was referring to her 'vagina and buttocks.'

Arevelo has been charged with rape of a child, indecent sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child and other counts.

‘I guess the best way for me to describe this guy is an animal,’ Superintendent Chitwood told NBC 10.

The teenager has denied raping his young relative in his bedroom, but he admitted to having an STD.

He is being held at the Delaware County Prison on $250,000 bail, reported Philly.com. 

Infected: The allegations against Arevelo came to light Tuesday when the 5-year-old girl tested positive for chlamydia. Pictured here is the Chlamydia trachomatis Bacteria

Arevelo is a native of Ecuador who has been living in Upper Darby legally. 

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued a legal notice to the Upper Darby police informing them that the federal agency intends to take Arevelo into custody.

According to Chitwood, the 18-year-old told police following his arrest that he would like to serve his prison sentence back home in Ecuador.

The victim’s mother has not been charged in the case.
