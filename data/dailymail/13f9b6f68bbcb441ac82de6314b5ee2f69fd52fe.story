A man who filmed himself chopping up his lover before posting body parts to politicians was being hunted across Europe last night.

Luka Magnotta, who is suspected of cannibalism, flew from Canada to France a day after placing gruesome footage of the murder on the internet.

Police fear the gay porn star may now have slipped into Britain. Six months ago, he was living in a £40-a-night room above the Fusilier Inn in Wembley, North London, while sightseeing in the capital.

Man hunt: Police are searching for Canadian porn star Luka Magnotta, left, after he allegedly hacked a man to death and posted his body parts to Canadian offices. The victim has been identified as Jun Lin, right

While in the UK, he was confronted by 
journalists after posting internet film showing a live kitten being fed 
to a snake. In an email to The Sun in December he supposedly said: ‘You 
will be hearing from me again. This time, however, the victims won’t be 
small animals.’ He sent a similar warning to the BBC.

Yesterday, as 190 countries joined in 
an Interpol manhunt for  Magnotta, his victim was identified as Lin Jun,
 a Chinese student who was studying in Montreal.

Police said Mr Lin, 33, was in a relationship with Magnotta, 29.

French detectives have told the Mail 
that Magnotta took a flight to Paris on Saturday. The murder is said to 
have taken place the night before. The victim’s foot arrived in the post
 at the Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa on Tuesday and a hand 
was also sent to the country’s Liberal Party.

Victim: Jun Lin, 33, was a Chinese student who had moved to Montreal to study. He dated Magnotta

A French detective said: ‘He’s 
obsessed with the Eiffel Tower and the Moulin Rouge and is confident 
that he can lie low in a country he loves. All efforts are being made to
 arrest him.’

Montreal police commander Ian 
Lafreniere said investigators are now scouring the internet in case 
Magnotta – who has posted extensively on social networking sites – has 
bragged about his escape from justice. He also warned that the fugitive 
is ‘someone who can disguise himself; he can change into a woman, wear a
 wig.’

Hazardous material: A police officer carries a yellow bag with the bloody package that contains the festering foot mailed to Conservative Party headquarters on Tuesday

Police say Mr Lin had been in Montreal since July last year and was studying at Concordia University.

His family lost contact with him on May 24.

Days later a janitor found his 
limbless body in a suitcase near Magnotta’s apartment in the city. Other
 body parts were found in the  flat. The video of the killing is called 
‘1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick’ and shows a man tied to a bed frame being hacked 
with a kitchen knife and the ice pick.

'Killer': Magnotta is believed to have fled the country on May 26 after the killing on the night of May 24 - 25

The victim’s throat is slashed and he is stabbed before being decapitated and dismembered.

The killer also appears to eat some of the flesh.

As in the movie American Psycho,  about a New York serial killer, the gruesome footage is set to the New Order song, True Faith.

Magnotta, who also uses the names Eric
 Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov, is said to have once dated Karla 
Homolka, a notorious Canadian sex killer who slaughtered schoolgirls.

Sickening: The thug places both of the cats inside a plastic bag and films them suffocating

Fugitive: The sparsely decorated and furnished apartment where Luka Rocco Magnotta is believed to have lived

Nina Arsenault, a transsexual who 
dated Magnotta a decade ago, yesterday told Canadian media that his 
anger came from problems with his family.

She said that after they met in a 
strip club they dated for only three weeks because Magnotta was so 
unstable he would pick fights in the street.

She said: ‘He hated his dad. He hated his family and said they didn’t understand him and he had to get away from him.’
