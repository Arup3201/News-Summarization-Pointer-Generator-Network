An 8-year-old boy has survived a six-story
fall down a trash chute at a Honolulu high-rise building, and he
escaped the chute with help from a bystander who pulled him out
using a hose, officials said on Tuesday.

The boy fell down a chute on the eighth floor of the
condominium building on Monday, coming to a stop on the second
floor when he hit a blockage of trash in the shaft, said
Honolulu Fire Department spokesman Captain David Jenkins.

A bystander took an emergency hose from a hallway and
dropped the end down to the child to pull him out, Jenkins said.  

'I could hear him screaming,' Dan Kaetsu told KHON. At least one other person appears to have helped Kaetsu. 

'We couldn’t see him where he was,' he continued. I broke the glass for the fire hose and sent it down to see if he could reach it. He said he grabbed it, so we started to pull him out.'

Safe: The boy suffered cuts and was hospitalized but is expected to survive, an official said

The affiliate station reported that Kaetsu had to get into the chute's door as part of the incident.

He told KHON the boy 'was way, way at the bottom, but he did fine. We were pulling him up. He was using the wall to walk up the trash chute.'

Kaetsu also told the affiliate station 'She said he was taking out the trash and he fell in.'

KHON reported the Honolulu Fire Department listed the waste chute door as a fire code violation in its September inspection of the premises.

The department told the affiliate station 'the chute door failed to close and latch on its own as designed and required by code.'

Speaking to HawaiiNewsNow, Kaetsu said 'I told him to hold on tight see if he could use walls and try to walk his way up. We had to stick our whole entire body into chute to see him. I just tried to talk to him while I pulled him up, just encourage him as he made his way up.'

'He had some cuts on his hand, feet, legs,' he also told the station. 'The biggest cut he had was on the top of his head. I'm not sure exactly how he fell in, but he was walking, crying and talking to me.'

The boy had injuries to his hands and face and was taken by ambulance to a hospital but was expected to survive, said Honolulu Emergency Services Department spokeswoman Shayne Enright.
