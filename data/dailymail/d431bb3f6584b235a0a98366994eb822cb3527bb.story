President Barack Obama tossed aside a long-standing 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Great Britain on Tuesday, telling reporters that choosing a 'best ally' between France and the UK would be like choosing his favorite daughter.

'I have two daughters,' the president said, referring to Sasha and Malia. 'And they are both gorgeous and wonderful, and I would never choose between them.'

'And that's how I feel about my outstanding European partners. All of them are wonderful in their own ways.'

Obama was speaking during a joint press conference with French President Francois Hollande, on the occasion of the first State Visit by a French head of state since 1976.

Rivals? UK Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande may both want super-best-friend status with Washington, but Obama is no longer playing favorites

The move is the latest snub of London, after Secretary of State John Kerry angered some in the British government by praising France as America's 'oldest ally' and part of a coalition of the willing prepared to strike against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom he called a 'thug and murderer.'

Kerry made no mention of Britain in his speech on Syria, but praised France, Australia and even Turkey.

Weeks later, British Prime Minister David Cameron failed to carry a vote in Parliament authorizing the use of military force in the Middle Eastern country. The 285–272 vote frustrated American military leaders and politicians.

Even then, a terse White House statement said the Obama administration would 'continue to consult' with Great Britain, 'one of our closest allies and friends.'

Ultimately, the U.S. called off the planned strikes.

On Tuesday, though, Hollande was center-stage.

'The U.S.-French alliance has never been stronger,' Obama said. 'That's good for France. It's good for the United States. It's good for the world, because we share certain values and certain commitments and are willing to act on behalf of those commitments and values.'

Obama appeared to cast aside an episode from the George W. Bush administration that had France refusing to participate in a coalition effort to invade Iraq while the UK led the way.

Within weeks 'French fries' were replaced in high profile eateries – including at least one congressional cafeteria on Capitol Hill – by 'Freedom fries.' And a character on the animated comedy show The Simpsons offered a label for the French that stuck: 'Cheese-eating surrender monkeys.'

Britain, meanwhile, enjoyed favored status in Washington. Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair had famously promised after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York and the Washington, D.C. suburbs that Britain would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the American people against a 'new evil of mass terrorism.'

What a difference an election makes! George W. Bush and Tony Blair once personified the 'special' U.S.-UK relationship, partnering in an effort to oust Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein from power

The U.S.-France bilateral talks are happening on a global stage, with the very real possibility of putting England's collective nose out of joint

Despite his projection of a strong relationship between the U.S. and France, Obama offered no word on Tuesday about whether the result would be helpful to England.

A French journalist had noted that he 'actually praised France very warmly today' and granted our President the first state visit of your second term.'

'Does that mean that France has become the best European ally of the U.S. and has replaced Great Britain in that role?'

'Oh, my,' a smiling Obama said, to a round of laughter.

Hollande followed Obama's lead with his own family comparison.

'I have four children,' he said through a translator, 'so that makes it even more difficult for me to make any choice at all.'

'But we're not trying to be anyone's favorite. There are historic links. We share common values.'

'And I can see that our views converge on many issues. But it's not about hierarchy; it's just about being useful to the world.'

Will David Cameron be pressed on Washington's 'special relationship' with London during Prime Minister's Questions?

But the journalist's question wasn't meant to be playful. It continued with a more serious demand about the implications of whether BFF status exists between Washington and Paris.

'If so,' came the zinger, 'why not extend to France the no-spying agreement that you have with England after the big scandal of the NSA’s surveillance program?'

Obama took issue with the premise of the question, cautioning that 'it's not actually correct to say that we have a "no-spy agreement" with Great Britain. That’s not actually what happens.'

'We don’t have – there’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' he said.

'We have, like every other country, an intelligence capability. And then we have a range of partnerships with all kinds of countries. And we’ve been in consultations with the French government to deepen those commitments.'
