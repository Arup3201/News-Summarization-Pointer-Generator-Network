Alvaro Recoba made a name for himself during a successful 11-year-spell at Inter Milan. But now, at 38, the former Uruguayan international has proved that he can still score stunning goals, by netting directly from a corner for Nacional.

Recoba is currently plying his trade in his home country, for Club Nacional de Football, and he wowed the 20,000 strong crowd with an amazing in-swinging corner in his side's match against Montevideo Wanderers on Saturday.

With the scores level at 0-0, Recoba stepped up to take a corner on the stroke of half-time, and to the surprise of all those inside Estadio Gran Parque Central, put enough swing on the ball to net directly from his set piece.

Recoba played 248 times for Inter Milan between 1997 and 2008, scoring 72 times in the process. When he left the San Siro, the veteran forward made a fleeting appearance in Greece for Panionios, but soon made the move back to Uruguay for the final years of his career.

He spent a season at Danubio, before signing for Nacional in 2011. He has played 59 times for his current club, and his stunning corner goal sent his goals tally to 14.

Recoba's goal set Nacional on their way to a 2-0 win against Montevideo Wanderers on Saturday, maintaining their place at the top of the Uruguayan Primera division after six wins from their first seven games. 

Amazingly, Recoba's goal direct from a corner against Wanderers is not the first time he has done it. In 2012, against Liverpool - not that Liverpool - the Uruguayan did much the same thing, and bent an in-swinging corner into the back of the net.
