Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber has told FIFA he would be interested in trialling Sepp Blatter's video referral system proposal in America as the idea is music to his ears.

Blatter wants to give managers the ability to challenge referee's calls during stops in play if they feel a decision was unfair.

Managers will be able to watch an incident with the referee on an off-pitch monitor before the official decides if a decision should be overturned or not.

The MLS could be the first to use a video referral system if Sepp Blatter's referral system is ratified by FIFA

The MLS were unable to introduce goal-line technology as they did not have the relevant funding

Blatter's proposal has been given the thumbs up by Garber who has put the MLS forward to act as a guinea pig to test the FIFA president's latest idea.

Garber, speaking to SI.com, said of using video technology to review decisions: '[It is] music to my ears. I would love to be able to do that. [MLS deputy commissioner] Mark Abbott was out in Zurich at a meeting last week [at FIFA headquarters] and let folks in Zurich know that we’d be happy to work with them to be that league.

'I don’t know what their plans are to experiment with that, but I believe the time has come for there to be a mechanism so that games are not determined by [referee calls] that are not right.'

The MLS were previously keen on introducing goal-line technology however the league later said the system was out of their budget.

How should it work? 

Blatter’s system will require a coach/manager to inform the fourth official that they are requesting a decision to be reviewed, rather like a tennis player or cricket captain does with Hawk-Eye. 

At the next stoppage in play the fourth official would tell the referee who would then look at a replay of the incident. If there is a clear error then he will overturn his decision, if not it will stand.

How many referrals per team/half/match? 

This is to be confirmed but I would expect no more than two challenges per team  and possibly only one per half. If the challenge proves to be correct then the coach will retain this challenge but if the referee was right then the challenge will have been used.

When will it be used?

Penalties – both those given and those not given, often when simulation is involved. The issue with that appeal is the call is often subjective and replays are ambiguous and open to interpretation. 

Offside calls that are clearly wrong can be challenged and corrected but only those leading to goals. These happen infrequently as Premier League assistants are so good but the Liverpool-Chelsea game last month would be one which would have benefitted from such legislation. 

Finally red card tackles and off-the-ball incidents could also benefit from referees reviewing replays but these might not be covered by this proposal.
