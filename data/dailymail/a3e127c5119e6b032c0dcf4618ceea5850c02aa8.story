Her ginormous breasts have already left her barely able to run, but now the 'human barbie' Lacey Wildd has revealed that she is planning a 13th breast enlargement.

Indeed, the mother-of-six from West Virginia - wants to enhance her chest to a QQQ cup size, and wants to go under the knife for her 37th operation in a bid to transform her appearance.

Not only that, the 46-year-old has been on an extreme diet in a bid to slim down to a tiny size zero.

Lacey Wildd took a stroll along the breach showing off her newly slimmed down figure, she has revealed she plans to lose more weight and wants her breasts enlarged again

Lacey, who this week showed off her curvaceous body in a tiny bikini, said: 'I feel really good but I still think I need to lose more weight. I want to go down to a size 3 or even a 0. 

'I want to have the most extreme body in the world, I want to be a walking cartoon character. But I know I have to be careful.'

Lacey had previously been turned down for more surgery by a doctor who told her that she would ruin her body if she made her breasts any larger.

However, she vowed to carry on until she found someone who would do the operation for her. 

Lacey has previously said: 'My world rotates around my boobs. I don't get high when I have surgery. But I do get a little thrill out of thinking I’m going to wake up looking different.'

Lacey's breasts are so large that she can only use the back hobs on her oven so she doesn't burn them

Lacy originally started off with breast enhancement surgery but soon moved on to other parts of her body.

'As I got older I got a flatter butt, so I had Brazilian butt lifts to give me more shape. I had three implants at $10,000 a time, so now I've got a $30,000 butt,' she jokes.

However her exaggerated curves mean that she finds it difficult to find clothes that actually fit her.

Her young daughter Jenaveve is less enthusiastic about her mother's massive embonpoint.

'I can’t go anywhere without people swarming over her,' she complains. As for the boobs themselves: It's disgusting,' she admits. 

Through the years Lacey has had so much surgery that she is no unrecognisable from her former self - pictured left before her surgery, and right, after her first operations

Lacey has previously stared in the TLC show My Strange Addiction, where she revealed all about her quest to look like Barbie

Lacey - who has been living off a controversial diet of just an apple, lemon juice and water for the past six weeks - has previously spoken out about her desire to look like Barbie.

In TLC's My Strange Addiction which filmed about her 36th surgery she said: 'I want to be an adult Barbie, like the extreme Barbie.

'I'm known as one of the most extreme plastic surgery patients in the world and I want to keep pushing the limits.'

'I'm proud to be plastic. I have spent a quarter of a million dollars to build the most extreme plastic body in the world,' she previously said.

'I'm not just obsessed with my boobs,' she added. 'I'm obsessed with the entire look. I'm looking for the perfect body.' 

Lacey's 36 previous surgeries include 12 boob jobs, liposuction, nose and chin augmentation and she's even had her bum made bigger. 

The huge weight of her chest - each breast currently weight 21 pounds - means that she has to prop pillows underneath her while driving and she only uses the back burners on her stove in case she burns her breasts while cooking.

Lacey has six children however, they are not all happy with her super enhanced assets
