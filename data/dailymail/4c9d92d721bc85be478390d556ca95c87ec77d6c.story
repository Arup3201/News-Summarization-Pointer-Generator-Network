Pouting Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh is celebrating boosting sales of her latest brand endorsement with a set of sexy pictures guaranteed to make beau Professor Green smile.

Following her lingerie clad appearance in a viral campaign in March sales of the Umberto Giannini Incredible Body range have risen an impressive 80 per cent.

The film noir inspired ‘online novel’ The Incredible Body features 22-year-old Millie as a femme fatale with fabulous hair and a wicked plan.

The unusual marketing stunt developed on blogging platform tumblr 
attracted tens of thousands of viewers and instigated fevered Twitter 
debate as well as thousands of new sales for the company – especially of
Millie’s two favourite products.

MIC’s Millie is the show’s biggest success story so far.

As well as snagging the most eligible man in show business the 
tan-o-holic was signed as an ambassador for bronzing brand St Tropez in 
May and is inundated with clothing and beauty products from companies 
desperate for some of the Channel 4 star’s selling power to rub off on 
them.

Last weekend she was pictured supporting Green from the side of the 
stage as one of the first celebrities to wear this festival season’s fashion must-have: the mini studded Hunter boot.

Talking about the cheeky viral the Quality Street heiress says: 'The character in this video was great fun to act. It felt really sexy to play the 'femme fatale' role. I love the film noir 1920s feel to it all and think it captures the glamorous essence of the range perfectly.'
