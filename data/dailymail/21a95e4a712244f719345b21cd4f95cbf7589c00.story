Former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt has said NHS patients could be sent to India for operations

NHS patients could be operated on in India to make huge savings for the health service, former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday.

The scheme could also see NHS doctors being flown to India to treat locals in a bid to raise money for cash-strapped UK hospitals – while cheaper Indian doctors come to the UK to perform operations.

It would involve NHS trusts going into business with private Indian healthcare firms.

Mrs Hewitt said there was a growing number of areas, including a range of cardiac procedures, where Indian doctors could deliver similar or better clinical outcomes at substantially lower costs than the NHS.

A combination of income from ventures in India and learning from India’s ‘frugal innovation’ could help close the NHS’s projected £30billion funding gap by 2020, she added.

But healthcare campaigners warned the proposals could compromise patient safety.

Up to 20 hospital trusts are already in talks with Indian companies about the potential business agreement, according to the Mrs Hewitt, who was health secretary between 2005 and 2007.

In an interview in the respected Health Service Journal, Mrs Hewitt said she expected ‘a half dozen to a dozen’ trusts of UK companies to have entered agreements with Indian healthcare firms by 2015.

Mrs Hewitt, chairman of the UK India Business Council, said: ‘Our ambition is to get as many (NHS trusts, UK health companies and charities) there as we can.’

The cost of surgery in the UK is far greater than in India. Heart bypass surgery in India is as cheap as £1,000, compared with £35,000 in the UK.

More than 70,000 Britons already fly abroad each year for private surgery, with many choosing to head to India.

Dr Kailash Chand, of the British Medical Association, told the Daily Mirror: ‘I think this is a huge scandal.’

He said the plans would mean losing manpower here – which could ‘pose a serious threat to patient safety’.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have no intention to send NHS patients to India for treatment.’
