England boss Roy Hodgson and captain Steven Gerrard will hold a press conference this afternoon as the Three Lions prepare for their first warm-up game ahead of the World Cup.

Hodgson's squad will be keen to impress the manager and a nation against a nation ranked 42 in the world at Wembley on Friday.

Sportsmail's James Andrew will bring you everything Hodgson and Gerrard have to say from 4pm.

Host commentator

'We didn’t do tactical sessions in Portugal. That was setting the tone and physical preparation. This week we’ve started tactical preparations. I would prefer to judge potential on what I’ve seen over the last two years.'

'He’s improved his all-round game. His passing in final third has improved and he’s added quality goals. It wouldn’t surprise me if he had a big impact on the World Cup.'

'I’m very proud of my roots. I’m one of the Baby Boom generation after the war and benefited from parents who made enormous sacrifices.'

'It’s always nice to meet people at that level. It was nice he took time and trouble today. He has a busy schedule. He wished all the players success and told us the whole country is behind us.'

Rooney: 'I’m very pleased with Wayne Rooney He came to us fully fit after working during his week’s holiday in Portugal. He obviously worked very hard because from the first moment he has been fit and lively as you'd expect. The past is the past. The present and future really interests me and I’m very happy.'

'This is the biggest moment of my career. I feel more at home with the players now than two years ago at the Euros.'

'Good players can play together. The only way we'll be successful is as a team and working together'

'I'm proud to be captain. I’m desperate to do well form personal point view and looking forward to team doing well. In Brazil makes it extra special. Everyone is excited.'

'I don’t know if he’s available. Only people who know is Luis and the doctors. It’s not my focus. My focus is on the England players.'

'Maybe it feels slightly different. There’s a lot of positivity about. The squad’s focused, desperate to do well and we can’t wait for June 12 to come around.'

'Everyone is pushing with three opportunities to stake your claim. Everyone’s impressed, even the young lads who have been invited to train with us.'

'I was never worried about that. I know he’s played tribute to Arsene Wenger and I would like to pay my tribute. Arsene is a well-balanced and intelligent coach and realises this tournament represents a great opportunity for Jack, something he really wants to do. Arsene has nursed him through so when he joined us he was in peak form.'

'They have all impressed me. If I could bottle what I am seeing in training and let it out on June 14, then I would.'

'When you have first class players like Rooney and Sturridge I believe they can always play together.'

'I have not told the players the team I have selected yet. I will do it in a meeting at lunch time tomorrow.'

'I’m not that near to knowing the team.

'There are a number of senior players who will feature, but there are a number of positions up for grabs.'

Roy Hodgson says there are no fresh injury concerns.

Luke Shaw has a cold and the England boss is unsure if he will be ready to face Peru

England's U19s have missed out on a place at the European Championships.

The Young Lions needed just a draw to qualify, but a 95th minute own goal from England's Lewis Baker means that they lost to Ukraine 1-0 and miss out on qualification.

Jack Wilshere had some injury problems towards the end of the season, but he is in the squad and he has thanked Arsene Wenger for keeping his World Cup dream alive.

We are expecting Roy Hodgson to speak ahead the Peru game any minute now.

The England players trained at St George's Park this morning and were joined by a special visitor, Prime Minister David Cameron.

It was the first time that David Cameron had visited England's new training camp in Burton and he spoke to manager Hodgson as well as players Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard.

England play Peru on Friday night. The majority of the squad will be back at Wembley 24 hours later for Carl Froch's mega-fight with George Groves.

England then head off to their pre-World Cup training camp in Miami.

England then play Ecuador and Honduras in Miami before heading to Brazil.

They open their World Cup campaign on June 14 against Italy in Manaus.

Peru were hand picked opponents by England.

The reason being that the South American's are expected to play in a similar style to Three Lions Group D opponents Uruguay.   

We are due to hear from England manager Roy Hodgson and captain Steven Gerrard ahead of Friday night's friendly against Peru at Wembley.
