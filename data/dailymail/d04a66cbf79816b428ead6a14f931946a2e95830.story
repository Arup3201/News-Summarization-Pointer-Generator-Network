A pet puppy miraculously survived a 200ft fall with only minor injuries after bolting over a grassy ridge on the edge of a cliff.

Jacky and David Pipe were walking their two four-month-old puppies Marley and Milo at the 350ft-high White Nothe cliffs near Weymouth, Dorset, when they both ran off.

The couple called for their dogs using a special whistle - but only border collie Milo returned. They then peered over the edge and saw little cocker spaniel Marley on a grassy ledge about 200ft down.

Mr and Mrs Pipe, both 50, dialled 999 and a cliff rescue specialist abseiled down the cliff to reach the black and grey pooch before hauling it back up to safety in an animal rescue bag at 12pm yesterday.

Mrs Pipe, a car parts delivery driver from Corfe Mullen, Dorset, said: ‘The dogs were running around off the lead and we were using a recall whistle to call them back to us.

‘We have done this before and usually have no problem, they are very obedient. But during the walk both dogs disappeared over a ridge and as soon as I saw them vanish I blew the whistle.

‘Milo came straight back but Marley was nowhere to be seen. My husband and I went over the ridge to see where he was. As we walked nearer the edge we saw him about 200ft down on a grassy slope.

‘I immediately thought he must have some severe injuries like a broken back or broken back legs. It was just awful and I was in shock - I had no idea what to do, and couldn’t believe it had happened.

‘We alerted the coastguards who did an amazing job and got him to safety using an animal bag.

'My heart was in my mouth when they reached the top of the cliff and the coastguard officer said he seemed to be okay.

'He was a bit dazed and traumatised but I took him to the vets and although he has some bruising to the mouth and a swollen eye, he is absolutely fine.’

Tony Goss, a coastguard with the Wyke Regis coastguard team, said: ‘Marley was off the lead and he went over the edge of the cliff. The cliffs are made up of a steep grassy slope at the top, then a vertical drop, and then another slope.

‘Luckily Marley had managed to land on a slope and probably rolled to a stop on a gravelly patch. If he had landed on flat ground it would have been a different story.

‘Because he was only 20 weeks old he probably wasn’t aware of what was happening and so he didn’t tense up, which is likely to have helped.’
