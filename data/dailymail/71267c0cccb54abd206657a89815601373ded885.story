Regency costumed guests arrived in their dozens at the carriage house for dinner during the Pride and Prejudice Ball at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire yesterday.

Celebrating the 200 years since the publication of Jane Austen's famed novel of the same name, the Pride and Prejudice ball at the stately home, believed to be the inspiration for Pemberley, Mr Darcy's residence, staged a costume evening to remember.

With capacity for 100 or more, the 
vast majority of Austen fans turned out in full Georgian costume - a key
point of the ball, though the fancy dress wasn't compulsory. Tickets were £65 per head.

A champagne reception in the Painted Hall was followed by
a a tour of the North
Wing, a grand five course dinner.

Afterwards guests were invited to take part in period dancing following a demonstration
by professional Jane Austen Dancers.

Attendees yesterday surely enjoyed themselves more than Elizabeth 
Bennet, who meets Mr Darcy for the first time at a similar event and 
takes an early dislike to him.

Chatsworth House is believed to be the 
inspiration for Pemberley, the residence of the novel's romantic hero 
Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy as Austen is known to have visited the home in 
1811 while staying at the Rutland Arms in Bakewell while penning the 
masterpiece.

She wrote the novel: 'The
eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite 
side of the valley into which the road into some abruptness wound.

'It
was a large, handsome, stone building standing well on rising ground, 
and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of 
some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any 
artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely 
adorned.'

The stately homes has been the seat of the 
Dukes of Devonshire since 1549 and is mentioned in Pride and Prejudice 
as one of the stately homes that Elizabeth Bennet visits before arriving at 
Pemberley.

Chatsworth also featured in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie starring Kiera Knightley.

Chatsworth, one of England’s greatest country 
estates, provided the perfect setting to launch the Peak District estate's Georgian Summer 
of events (27 July - 29 August), all of 
which are free to visitors with a house and garden ticket, celebrating the bicentennial anniversary of Austen's novel.

An 
exhibition in the New Gallery looks at Chatsworth in the time of Pride
and Prejudice and compares it to Pemberley, featuring a display of
Georgian era items as well as those of Mr Darcy from the 2005 film.

Georgian
themed events in the garden will take place every Saturday including Sing Live, where singers perform 
in the garden dressed in Pride and Prejudice costumes.

The regency dancing provided some much-needed guidance for some guests unfamiliar with the moves of the 1800s

Like a scene from the film itself, the party have all clearly made an effort to look the part and fit in with the theme of the evening yesterday
