Retailers typically add seasonal staff in the weeks leading up to the holiday shopping season to work in stores and help in other areas, such as in distribution and fulfilling online orders.

Full-time workers get stock grants and benefits. The company says its full-time employees make 30 per cent more than traditional retail employees.

‘Temporary associates play a critical role in meeting increased customer demand during the holiday season, and we expect thousands of temporary associates will stay on in full-time positions,’ Dave Clark, vice president of Global Customer Fulfillment, said in a statement.

It says stock grants have added an average 9 per cent to base pay over the last five years.Tuesday's announcement follows hiring announcements from major retailers.
