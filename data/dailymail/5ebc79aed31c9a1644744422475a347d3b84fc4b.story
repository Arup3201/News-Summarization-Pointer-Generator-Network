MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon will yet again be facing each other in a cup competition as the two rivals compete for a place in the third round of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy next month.

In August the pair met at Stadium MK in the Capital One Cup first round with the hosts comfortably beating their League Two opposition 3-1. 

AFC Wimbledon will look to avenge that scoreline as they travel to Milton Keynes again for their St Johnston's Paint Trophy clash, praying that is third time lucky for them.
