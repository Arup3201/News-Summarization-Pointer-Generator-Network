Suicide: Billy Slagle said he was taking his destiny into his own hands by killing himself on Death Row

An Ohio inmate who hanged himself just days before his execution wrote in a suicide note that he resented how Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro received a life sentence while he was given death.

Billy Slagle, 44, hanged himself with a belt
 and shoestring in his cell on death row 
at Chillicothe Correctional Institution on August 4 - just three days before he was scheduled to die for stabbing his neighbor Mari Anne Pope to death during a robbery in 1987.

His execution was scheduled despite a calls, surprisingly, from the prosecution not to execute him. His victim's family has also requested that he not be put to death.

In his suicide note, he called his nearly three decades in prison torture and said he was taking his destiny into his own hands, according to the State Highway Patrol report.

'In this letter, Slagle 
gives details of what to do with his body and his property, claims Ohio 
had no mercy on him, talks about his charges, that he has to forfeit his
 life but Ariel Castro avoids the death penalty,' the patrol's summary 
of the suicide note said.

It
 continued: '... he states the death penalty is inconsistent and 
arbitrary, and his final paragraph is an apology to his loved ones'.

Slagle's final two phone calls, made the 
evening before, appeared to be to family members and did not mention 
suicide or the upcoming execution, the report said.

Anger: In a suicide note, he expressed resentment that Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro, pictured, was only sentenced to life whereas he was given death. Castro also killed himself a month after Slagle

In an unusual move, Tim McGinty, the prosecutor, had pushed for Slagle to be spared, arguing that under current practice in Cuyahoga County the crime wouldn't have been prosecuted as a death penalty case. He added that life without parole was not an option when Slagle was tried.

Pope's family had joined the request for clemency for Slagle. A friend of Pope, a woman whose two children were in Pope's house as she was killed, had opposed mercy for Slagle.

Slagle also died not knowing his attorneys were planning a last-minute appeal based on newly discovered information that Slagle was never informed of a plea bargain offered at the time.

In a further twist, Castro himself was found hanged in his cell a month after Slagle's suicide.

A coroner has ruled Castro's death suicide, but a prisons report has suggested he might have died while trying to achieve a sexual thrill as he choked himself.

Slagle's attorneys said on Thursday they remain saddened by his death.

'His loss of hope is evident by what little information this report reflects of his suicide note,' federal public defenders Joe Wilhelm and Vicki Werneke said in an email.

Two prison guards have been suspended while the state investigates allegations an electronic log documenting checks on Slagle the day he died was falsified.

The patrol report said Slagle was last seen alive just after 4am, about an hour before he was discovered hanging in his cell.
