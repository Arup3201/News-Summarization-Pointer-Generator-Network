Manchester United's new signing Daley Blind has left for Holland's Euro 2016 qualifier against the Czech Republic in Prague with a parting (snap) shot.

The Dutchman proved there is no time nor place not worthy of taking a selfie by posting a picture of himself, looking strangely thoughtful, alongside teammate Stefan de Vrij on a plane with a caption that simply reads: 'Off we go'.

Holland unexpectedly reached the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil under manager Louis van Gaal, with Blind playing an important role that included an incredible pass to set up Robin van Versie for a memorable diving header.

Hot wheels: The Holland defender signed for Manchester United for £16million on deadline day

Who's the boss? Blind will be reunited with former Holland manager Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford

The three have now been reunited at Old Trafford after new manager Van Gaal signed Blind for a £16million fee on deadline day. The 24-year-old's versatility means he can play in a number of different positions in midfield and defence.

Gus Hiddink, who has replaced Van Gaal as manager, saw Holland lose their first game under his guidance following a 2-0 defeat by Italy last Thursday.

The Oranje play Czech Republic on Monday in Hiddink's first competitive game in charge and will feel confident of qualifying from a group containing Turkey, Latvia, Iceland and Kazakhstan.
