A Pennsylvania man with a history of violence has been accused of holding his girlfriend captive for more than three days during which he repeatedly struck her with a hammer, pulled out clumps of her hair and poured bleach in her eyes and wounds.

Police in Latrobe said the victim, Stacey Myers, 40, escaped Saturday morning from 43-year-old Glenn Whittier’s home on Spring Street.

She was taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital suffering from a laundry list of injuries, including bleeding in her lungs, skull trauma, bite marks on her chest and cuts on her back and thigh.

Myers spent half of last week captive in Whittier's home in Spring Street in Latrobe, Pennsylvania 

Police said Myers, a mother of two grown daughters and a grandmother, told them Whittier hit her with the hammer. They say she had bite marks, cuts, bruises and a large amount of hair missing from her scalp.

Cody Ghrist, the boyfriend of Myers' daughter Ashley, told the station WTAE when the woman showed up on his doorstep on Main Street sometime after 11am Saturday, she was covered in wounds and could hardly walk or talk.

The couple called police after the badly beaten woman fell asleep, and officers who responded to the home found her lying on the floor with bruises on her face and body. 

'She had slurred speech and was unsure of her surroundings,' a police officer wrote in a report cited by TribLive.com. [She] also had a severe injury to her left ear.'

History repeats itself: Whittier has a lengthy criminal record, which includes charges of domestic violence

Whittier's neighbor Tracey Mehalic told the station that she often heard screams and sounds of fighting coming from the man’s apartment. 

Online records show Whittier has a lengthy criminal record, which includes charges of domestic violence, harassment and disorderly conduct.

He was being held Wednesday in the Westmoreland County prison on $100,000 bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 23 on charges including aggravated assault and unlawful restraint.
