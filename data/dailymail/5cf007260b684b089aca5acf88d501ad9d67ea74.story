The extreme winter weather that hit the South on Sunday and Monday is making its way up the coast, and has already succeeded in shutting down the federal government.

All government offices in Washington DC were closed on Tuesday due to the dangerous blend of snow and ice that has made travel increasingly difficult.

And while the storm is slowly making its way out of the South, its effects are still being felt by the 330,000 people who are without power in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

The storms has also forced the cancellation of over 1,000 flights, and left hundreds stranded due to the icy roads.

NBC News reports that the worst hit was Coleman, Kentucky, where 18 inches of snow fell, and Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, where a ¾-inch coating of ice was reported.

The ice also became a huge problem for Lauren Adamski of Cabot, Arkansas as she and her husband David drove to the hospital Sunday night after her water broke.

Because of the ice on the roads the two did not make it in time, and Adamski gave birth in her truck.

In the end, the couple had a healthy baby boy they named Brennan. 

In New Jersey, one unlucky plow even fell into a sinkhole, becoming almost entirely swallowed up. 

It happened in Lopatcong Township early Tuesday, and the driver, while shaken, was able to get out, and after being taken to the hospital he was quickly released.  

The South will be hit again on Thursday with snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures expected in parts of Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia.

Nashville, Tennessee could even reach a record low of -13F, the coldest since 1871.

These temperatures could turn into an even bigger problem should power not be restored to some 330,000 homes and business that are in the dark.

Boston residents continue to have it the worst though, and now there are new problems as some people have not been following a new order put in place that guarantees any resident who shovels out a parking spot the right to keep it for 48 hours.

One person got revenge on someone who took their spot by dumping snow all over their car, and posting the photo online. 

Residents in Washington DC also took some time to have a little fun on Tuesday, with a massive snowball fight in Meridian Hill Park.

'That was a lot of fun and I figured, heck, why not do it this year. Just this time in costume,' said Colin Lawrence, clad head to toe in a Captain America get-up. 

'Good times. Everybody's having a good time.'

The cold weather will only get worse in some areas later this week

Meanwhile, a passenger on an Amtrak train heading between New York City to Boston filmed the sub-zero conditions between carriages due to Winter Storm Neptune.

The passenger filmed the Arctic conditions between the carriages on the train service.

In the video, the passenger opens the passageway door and enters the freezing area. The passenger pans their camera around to show how all the surfaces are covered in a dusting of frost. There also appears to be snow on the floor - despite the windows being closed.

Despite the unusual conditions on board the train and the freezing conditions along the East Coast, unseasonably warm temperatures across the rest of the country mean the U.S. is experiencing one of its warmest winters on record.

Almost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January, while parts of the East Coast, including New York and Boston are continuing to be battered by a freezing storm system.

In this month alone thousands of warm weather records have been broken as high temperatures across the western states contributes to what is now the country's sixth-warmest winter on record.

The West is experiencing temperatures which have contributed to the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. Pictured is Lake Success, near East Porterville, California, where drought conditions are worsening   

The East Coast storm system - which follows a weekend storm that dumped a staggering 16.5 inches of snow on Boston - is set to hit the South

So far this month there have been 4,074 records set for warm temperatures across the West, USA Today reported. This includes hot weather records in Seattle, San Jose, Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City.

Remarkably, the average February temperature in Salt Lake City is 16.4 degrees above average, while Boise is up 12.2 degrees and Phoenix 8 degrees.

Amazingly, as well as being covered in ice, the area appears to have its own fog problem 

Last month, the West, Rocky Mountains and Northern and Central Plains were all warmer than average, with many maintaining hot temperatures that placed the month among their top ten warmest averages.

Incredibly, San Francisco had no measurable rainfall during January, while the state of California itself had its fourth-driest ever January.

As well as remaining unseasonably warm, much of the West continues to suffer drought conditions.

Nearly all of Hawaii was drier than average, with drought expanding to 46.6 per cent of the state, according to the National Climatic Data Center.

And although the drought improved in parts of the Southern Plains and Southwest, it worsened in the West and Midwest. 

While storms in early December gave farms in California a boost, temperatures across the state remain unseasonably high

A further six two 12 inches of snow is expected to hit the East Coast over the next several days

The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people.

In contrast to the big dry in the West, Winter Storm Octavia - which follows a weekend storm that dumped 16.5 inches of snow on Boston over the weekend - is now set to pummel the South.

Residents in Boston have battled through 16.5 inches of snow while New Yorkers are preparing for another six inch-dumping.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Washington DC was bracing for between four to eight inches of snow, according to USA Today .

Mayor Muriel Bowser told CNN's 'The Situation Room' that the weather was 'dangerous cold'. Federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday.

Father south, up to a foot of snow was forecast in Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, where Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a statewide emergency.

The bad weather will also hit states as far south as Kentucky and Tennessee bring heavy snow fall

Kentucky and Tennessee were also preparing to be battered by the storm, which could dump more than a foot of snow on each state. 

As many as 50 million people were in the path of the glacial weather, which will see temperatures far more frigid than normal, the National Weather Service warned, adding that the misery was forecast to last through much of the week for the eastern US.

'Incredibly, another arctic front will arrive to the East Coast by Wednesday night, and this will bring some truly frigid conditions with it,' it said. ' 

'Some places from the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic may see some of the coldest weather since the mid-1990s! Numerous record low temperatures are expected.'

Southern states not used to such cold weather were also hit.

The storm followed a track from eastern Kansas through Tennessee and West Virginia to the mid-Atlantic Coast, the New York Times said.

Most of the affected areas can expect a snowstorm about once a year. But states like Kentucky were seeing snowfall well above average, said Jim Hayes, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.

Weather forecasters warned that temperatures were set to plunge to -18F in Erie, Pennsylvania  

'This is going to be a big event for them,' he said. 'They don't get that much snowfall very often,' he said, according to the Times.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said that after a series of mammoth storms in recent weeks it could take up to a month to restore the ageing system to full operation, if no more storms blow in. Boston braced for one to six inches more of snow, forecasters said, according to the Boston Globe. 

Snowfall amounts of six to 12 inches were anticipated in much of the mid-Atlantic, which includes Washington DC as well as New York City some 200 miles to the north.

US forecasters said the storm will buffet a wide swath of the eastern United States with snow, gale-force winds and brutal cold.

Among the cities expected to be hardest hit by the temperature plunge are Erie, Pennsylvania, where thermometers are expected to fall to minus 28 degrees Celsius and Cleveland, Ohio, with minus 22 degrees Celsius.

The Flightaware air travel website said that some 1,500 flights had been cancelled by midday Monday, before the latest bout of inclement weather had been felt.

February has set a record as the snowiest month ever in Boston, with 10 times the snowfall it would get in a typical winter.

With the snowstorm expected to at least brush New England's most populous city, mountains of snow piling up were likely to grow even higher.

'No end appears in sight as to the brutal winter we have experienced,' the NWS wrote in its Boston forecast.
