A woman has been sexually assaulted by a group of teenagers, who were  wearing Scream masks, on the evening of Halloween.

The 22-year-old victim was approached by four youths, who were all wearing the mask, before she was dragged to the ground and sexually assaulted  in Denton, Greater Manchester on Friday night.

The woman managed to fight them off and raised the alarm.

One of the teenagers was described as 'chubby' and in his early teens while another was tall and wearing white trainers. The attackers were all wearing dark clothing.

The 'Ghostface' type masks were made famous by cult horror film Scream.

Greater Manchester Police said the woman was walking along Sunningdale Road in the Haughton Green area of Denton when she was attacked.

Superintendent Neil Evans said: 'This young woman has suffered a traumatic ordeal at the hands of four individuals who were dressed in Halloween-type masks.

'She was pushed to the floor and sexually assaulted, leaving her in a state of total shock, and clearly she is extremely distressed.

'Anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault will know just how frightening it must have been for this victim, and given the offenders were wearing masks designed to be scary means it must have been a truly harrowing and scary few minutes for this woman.'

He added: 'The purpose of this appeal is not to unduly alarm the community but it is important we let people know what has happened so they can both be vigilant and help us track down these cowardly offenders.

'If you know of anyone who might be involved, then please call us.

'If you are a parent and you know your child went out with friends dressed in these type of masks and you have suspicions then, please, do the right thing and call us.

'This woman has suffered a terrible ordeal and we need, for her sake and the wider community, to catch the culprits.

'We are conducting a number of inquiries in the local community and I want to assure people we will do everything we can to find those responsible.'

Police are appealing for anyone who has information about the assault to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A few hours later, one man was injured and his wife and child left in shock after they were attacked by a man wearing a Scream-mask and two accomplices on Halloween night.

The young family was walking home from a party in Abingdon, Oxon, at 1am on Saturday morning when the trio struck.

The masked man and his accomplices all punched the 30-year-old repeatedly after barging his shoulder as he walked behind his wife and child.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'Three men approached the victim, one of them pushed him to the shoulder and punched him to the side of the head.

'The other two offenders also punched the victim before running away towards the town centre.

'The victim sustained bruising and swelling to his right eye and his face but did not require hospital treatment,' said the spokesman.

'The first offender was white and under 6ft tall. He was wearing a Scream mask, a black top and blue jeans and a grey hooded top with the hood up. 

'The second man was white, aged in his early 20s, under 6ft tall and was wearing a black cap, a dark top and dark hair. He had fake blood on his face.

'The third offender was white, under 6ft tall and was wearing dark clothing,' added the spokesman.

Police have not named the victim but appealed for help from the public to catch the trio as quickly as possible.
