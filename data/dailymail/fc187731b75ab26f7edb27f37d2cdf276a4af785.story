Chinese authorities have been accused of an anti-Christian crackdown after ripping down a church in 'the Jerusalem of the East'.

The nation's Communist party keeps a tight grip on religion, fearing challenges to its authority, but allows worship at state-controlled churches.

Thousands of protesters have spent weeks as a human shield around the Protestant Sanjiang church in Wenzhou, south east China, after officials claimed it was four times the permitted size.

Ripped down: Four bulldozers started demolishing Sanjiang church in Wenzhou after weeks of protests

Last week, the church's leaders reportedly struck a deal with the government to save the building, completed in 2013.

But today four excavators were sent to demolish the symbolic landmark.

It is one of 10 planned demolitions in the region, which has become a stronghold for the marginalised religion.

Christians blasted the move as a 'barbaric campaign' by Communist leaders to suppress their culture.

Controversy: State media claims the landmark was approved but it was built four times the permitted size

Bob Fu, a US-based Christian activist, told The Telegraph: 'This government-orchestrated barbaric forced demolition represents a serious escalation against religious freedom in Zhejiang.

'The Chinese regime chooses to disregard its own laws and the will of its best citizens.'

Officials rubbished the claims, stating the church violates building restrictions.

According to the China Aid Association (CAA), the local government had agreed to only demolish two storeys of an accessory building, not the main structure, but the deal fell through today.
