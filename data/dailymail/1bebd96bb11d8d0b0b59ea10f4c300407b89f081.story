David Cameron has warned newspapers to sign up to his plan for state-backed regulation of the Press or risk a crackdown from a less 'liberal' government in the future.

The Prime Minister said if the Press continues to make the 'mistake' of refusing to do so, a future 'illiberal' government may impose tougher restrictions.

His stance is in stark contrast to Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who recently indicated nothing would happen if the Press refused to sign.

Most national newspapers have refused to sign up to the politicians' new system of Press regulation underpinned by Royal Charter, over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of Press freedom.

They have put forward their own proposal for a tough new regulator, independent of politicians, which they say meets Lord Leveson's recommendations.

Speaking to The Spectator magazine, Mr Cameron said he wanted to see newspapers be 'compliant' with the politicians' charter.

'I believe there's a great opportunity here to put this difficult and painful issue to bed,' he said.

'If the Press set up their regulator I hope, in time, they will make that regulator compliant with – to then seek recognition under – the charter recognition body.

'If that then happens, we'll have in place a system that I think will settle this issue because we would have achieved what Leveson wanted which is independent self-regulation by the Press.'

He said politicians have given the Press 
'an opportunity to put this issue to bed I would think for 50 to 100 
years if you want to'.

'Now, if you choose to set up your self-regulator but say "we're not going to seek recognition", that is your choice,' he said.

'Personally I think that is a mistake because you're missing the opportunity to settle this and you're risking that some future, less liberal, less enlightened government at the time of the next Press crisis will hitch you with some hideous statutory regulation which I prevented.'

Mr Cameron added: 'If you choose to set up your body but not seek recognition, that is your decision.

'We've done our bit to put this in place, I think you're at risk in the future but it's your choice.

'I find it hard to understand what is it in the process of seeking recognition that sends you into such a problematic state, but that's for you to decide.'

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: 'I think this proposed Royal Charter is indefensible and it's bang out of order to try to defend it on the basis a future government might do something even more indefensible.

'The Press in this country hasn't been forced to publish under licence for centuries and it would be a massive black mark against this Government if they push ahead with this folly.'

Kirsty Hughes, the chief executive of Index on Censorship, said: 'The Royal Charter already steps over a red line – the threat that it could be replaced by something even worse doesn't make it acceptable.

'This is a point of fundamental principle and the Press should stick to their guns.'
