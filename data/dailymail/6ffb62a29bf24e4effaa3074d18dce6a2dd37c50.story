Best Buy corporate workers are the latest to trade in their bathrobes for briefcases, as it was revealed today the brick-and-mortar company is now placing a ban on telecommuting.

The company has decided to end its results-oriented policy in favor of the traditional 40-hour work week done from an office environment.

News of the switch comes after the controversial decision by Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer to require all workers to come into the office, which has sparked a national debate over office policy.

Changes made: Struggling electronics retailer Best Buy will no longer allow its corporate members to telecommute

According to Minnesota Public Radio, the change was sparked in part because of the electronic retailer’s struggling performance against online stores such as Amazon.

The idea is that Best Buy’s employees will be able to better collaborate and generate ideas while working in an office.

Winds of change: Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly has made several dramatic changes to the company since coming on in August of 2012

The previous policy allowed corporate workers to pick their hours and schedule while working from home. As long as their weekly tasks were completed, it did not matter whether they put in the standard 40 hours.

Both Best Buy and Yahoo! have recently brought on new CEOs. Best Buy’s executive, Hubert Joly, who was the former CEO of a hospitality and travel company in Minneapolis, joined Best Buy last August and has been has been working to make the struggling company more efficient.

The Minneapolis-based chain beat expectations in its recent fourth-quarter results, but Best Buy gave a cautious outlook on the first quarter because of increased investments.

A Best Buy spokesperson did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

Mayer, the former Google Inc. executive, took the demanding top role at Yahoo! when she was five months pregnant.

In a memo to employees late last month, she wrote: ‘Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home,’ according to Yahoo employees.

‘We need to be one Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together.’

However, the executive has been criticized for using her clout and status within the company to build a nursery for her child at company headquarters – a luxury that is not afforded to the majority of employees.

Similar to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Mayer says that her top priorities are not in the office, saying her concerns were: ‘God, family, and Yahoo! – in that order.’

Tech companies are noted for offering creative work arrangements and were pioneers in offering the option for staff to check in remotely.

Richard Branson, head of Virgin Group, said the move by Yahoo! undermined the trust that staff would get their work done wherever, without supervision, as working is no longer 9-5.

'This seems a backwards step in an age when remote working is easier and more effective than ever,' Branson wrote in a blog on the Virgin website.

'If you provide the right technology to keep in touch, maintain regular communication and get the right balance between remote and office working, people will be motivated to work responsibly, quickly and with high quality.'

Earlier this week, Best Buy announced 400 job cuts at its headquarters as part of a $725 million cost-cutting plan. On Friday the company said it expects to announce more job cuts later this year.

The company also said it plans $700 million to $800 million in capital spending and $150 million to $200 million in other expenses in fiscal 2014 as it invests in its business, mainly online and mobile channels. It plans to revamp Bestbuy.com by fiscal 2015.
