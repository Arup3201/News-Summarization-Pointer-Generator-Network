These pictures show a flock of swans making the most of flooding in Worcester.

Following heavy rainfall yesterday and overnight, the river Severn burst its banks - with river water surging through the town centre.

But these inquisitive birds saw an opportunity to explore and paddled their way through Worcester's streets.

Family day out? A group of swans make their way down the flooded River Severn in Worcester today

Leading the way? One intrepid bird breaks away from the pack to eye-up some railing which usually stand at the water's edge

In the first photograph, five swans can be seen making their way down the flooded river.

Then, with a certain amount of caution, a few of the animals carefully make their way over a metal fence which usually marks the water's edge.

They then have a gander at a sign post and even some bins.

Later, at least forty swans can be seen exploring round the red brick buildings in front of Worcester church.

Let's go! After careful consideration, the animals paddle over the submerged railing and into the streets of the town centre

According to reports, the town saw between 20 - 30mm of rainwater fall throughout Monday.

Yesterday, the Met Office issued yellow warnings in Worcestershire for rain, strong winds and flooding on the river Severn.

Three flood warnings and six flood alerts were issued for the county.

The extreme weather was expected to last throughout today with the river predicted to reach six metres at Diglis House, Worcester town centre.

Taking in the sights? One swan swims past a bin. Between 20 -30mm of rainwater fell in the town overnight, with the Met Office flood warnings across the county
