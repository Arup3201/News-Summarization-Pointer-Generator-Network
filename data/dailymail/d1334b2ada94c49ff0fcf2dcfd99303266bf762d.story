Paris Saint-Germain want talks with Chelsea over defender Branislav Ivanovic.

Not content with taking David Luiz for £50m, the French champions have expressed interest in Eden Hazard, Oscar and Petr Cech. Yet they have Ivanovic back on the agenda after realising Chelsea will not offer him a new contract just yet.

The Serbia defender, 30, has two years left on his deal and is keen to tie himself to Stamford Bridge until the end of his career.

French fancy: Branislav Ivanovic is wanted by big spending PSG amid uncertainty over his next contract

However, Chelsea's policy now is similar to other big clubs, where they will only offer one-year extensions to players of 30 or above.

That means any proposed talks will be shelved until next summer when Ivanovic has 12 months remaining.

The defender and his representatives wanted to add another two years to his deal supported by statistics that show he has averaged over 40 games a season for the past five years.

PSG are willing to offer Ivanovic that security and will bid around £15million for him should his relationship with Chelsea deteriorate.

Jose Mourinho is in the throes of lowering his squad's age with the likes of 19-year-old Kurt Zouma due to arrive and tentative enquiries made for Real Madrid's Raphael Varane, 21, yet the coach recognises a need for experience if they are to win the big games.

That has been reflected in their talks with Atletico Madrid where they have discussed four players, notably 28-year-old left back Filipe Luis, 28-year-old centre back Diego Godin plus free agent Tiago, 33, and Diego Costa, 25.

Ivanovic is still a favourite with Mourinho but the club policy may force his departure.

Tottenham have made contact over Swansea defender Ben Davies as Mauricio Pochettino looks to strengthen his options at left back.

Pochettino wanted Davies, 21, when at Southampton as a replacement for Luke Shaw and is now keen to take him to White Hart Lane.

Ryan Bertrand has also been mentioned while Fabio Coentrao will be offered to top English sides over the coming weeks also.

Both are possibles for Liverpool if they fail to complete a deal for Alberto Moreno from Sevilla.

West Ham are waiting on Cheikhou Kouyate to decide his future after making a bid for the Anderlecht defender.

Valencia are the main competition as they have matched the offer and look set to bring in some big names over the summer should owner Peter Lim ratify his financial investment.

The 24-year-old Kouyate has forged a strong reputation for himself in Belgium with Arsenal having watched him in recent seasons too but Sam Allardyce has taken the initiative.

Hertha Berlin are in talks over a move for former Fulham and Everton defender Johnny Heitinga. The 30-year-old is a free agent after leaving Craven Cottage last month and also has an offer from Besiktas.

Another former Fulham player Steve Sidwell is weighing up interest from Stoke, Leicester and QPR ahead of making his next move. The 31-year-old is a free agent.

Meanwhile, Hertha striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who spent last season on loan at Hamburg, is still in talks over a possible move to England with Newcastle favourites for the 22-year-old.

Torino want to take Gaston Ramirez back to Italy. The 23-year-old is eager to return to Serie A after joining Southampton from Bologna in 2012. He failed to hold down a regular place under Mauricio Pochettino and has been looking for a move in recent months.

AC Milan showed some interest but they only want a loan with the club strapped for cash and that does not suit Southampton.

Bayern Munich have expressed an interest in Manchester City's Aleksandar Kolarov. The 28-year-old has plenty of admirers with Roma and Juventus particularly keen.

They want the Serbian to drop his wages to help facilitate a deal but the interesting new element is Bayern who are understood to have contacted Kolarov's brother to sound out the possibilities.

Kolarov is in the last year of his contract and is willing to move to play more games.

City have targeted Bacary Sagna, have offers in for Mehdi Benatia and Eliaquim Mangala and hope to sign Fernando from Porto this week. A left back has not been a priority but they have considered Ashley Cole knowing Kolarov could go.

The former England defender is a possible at Real Madrid should Fabio Coentrao leave while there is the option of joining City's New York franchise too.

Manchester City will not countenance offers for Sergio Aguero.

Speculation is gathering momentum in Spain as they anticipate bids from either Barcelona or Real Madrid for the Argentine.

Sportsmail reported earlier this year that City had made efforts to ensure Aguero was well aware of how important he was to the club's future and that has not changed.

Staying power: Manchester City will not entertain any offers from Barcelona or Real for Sergio Aguero 

The only way anything will change is if the player says he is no longer content at the Etihad.

City did have an interest in Cesc Fabregas a year ago but that has changed and they do not intend to look at any mooted Barcelona proposals of a swap involving Fabregas plus cash.

Real Madrid present the greatest threat owing to location and their financial muscle but they are still contemplating a late offer for Luis Suarez too.
