A witness says he heard the sarcastic final words of a Texas student moments before he was shot dead by a college police officer.

Robert Cameron Redus, 23, was killed 
when Corporal Chris Carter, 35, opened fire on him in the early hours of
 Friday morning a few blocks away from the University of the Incarnate 
Word in San Antonio where Redus studied, set to graduate in May.

Neighbour Mohammad Haidaras told My San Antonio  that he heard a tense exchange between Redus and Carter sixty seconds before shots rang out.

He told the website: 'I heard (a man) say, 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost.'

The 22-year-old claims he heard gunshots less than a minute later and jumped into his closet.

Investigators say an altercation began when Carter tried to pull Redus over for speeding and driving erratically. 

College shooting: Cameron Redus was killed after a campus cop shot him multiple times during a traffic stop

Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police

Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department told KSAT that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Tree House apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where Redus was a resident.

Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates.

According to Pruitt, Carter tried to pull him over on Broadway for driving erratically, despite the fact that Redus was off-campus.

It is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments.

Once there, both got out of their cars and some kind of struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot.

A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings.

'I didn't hear him say anything like, "Get down on your hands and knees," you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the man told KSAT.

'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.'

Gentle: Cameron Redus, who was described by friends as not being aggressive, was shot five times by a campus cop

Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments.

He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter.

'I heard [a man] say, "Oh, you're gonna shoot me?" like sarcastic almost,' he said.

Less than a minute later, Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.'

Carter has been placed on administrative leave while officers investigate the shooting.

University officials describe him as having 'extensive law enforcement background.'

According to records viewed by My San Antonio, Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career.

He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career.

Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio.

Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss.

'We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time,' the victim's family said in a statement.

Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news.

'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.'

'He was an honor student, dean’s list every semester, incredibly intelligent,' said Annie Jones. 'So, so, so smart. He was our co-valedictorian in high school.'

A vigil has been set for 7pm on Saturday at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto.

According to ABC, Redus' family has hired an attorney.
