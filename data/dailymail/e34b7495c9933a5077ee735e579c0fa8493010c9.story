'He was a beautiful boy. Friendly, lively. He always liked to play,' said neighbor Elsie Witty to The New York Daily News.

Neighbor Jeanette Rivera, 47, recalls seeing the boy with his mother who was dressed in hospital scrubs.

'We didn’t hear anything, which is what’s weird,' Rivera said.

'Police said they were here because of a 4-year-old and they said he could’ve been abuse. We asked, "Is he OK?"

He is already gone, said the police.

Rivera says she didn't know the family very well but that all of them were very quiet.

'In the morning, I’d see the mother walk him to the car,' Rivera said.

'I didn’t know them well, they kept to themselves. Very quiet.'
