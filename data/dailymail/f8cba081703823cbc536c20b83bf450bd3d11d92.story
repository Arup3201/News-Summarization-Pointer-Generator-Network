Scores of firefighters from two counties converged on the Yorkshire Moors to battle widespread fires that blazed through the night.

More than 40 firefighters from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service joined West Yorkshire crews to help tackle pockets of fire that stretched from Mytholmroyd, in Yorkshire, into Littleborough, in Rochdale.

At least 14 fire engines were called to the scene, where one blaze at its height stretched for more than a mile, threatening isolated cottages and farmhouses.

All night operation: The dry ground was still smouldering today after firefighters spent the night battling flames on the Yorkshire Moors

Damping down: Crews maintained a presence on the moors all night to ensure the safety of remote properties, before once again starting to tackle the flames at first light

The fires had spread across dry vegetation from West Yorkshire and across the county border.

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said six fire engines and an operational support unit were called to land behind the Summit pub on Todmorden Road at around 7.30pm last night.

Another fire engine from Rochdale and one from Littleborough joined six Yorkshire fire engines in tackling pockets of fire dotted across the moorland.

After battling for hours to keep the raging flames under control, crews were forced to withdraw from the hillside for safety reasons as darkness fell.

Firefighters maintained a presence on the moorland throughout the night, damping down remote properties under threat from the pockets of fire.

They used strategically placed fire engines to protect the properties, crews said.
