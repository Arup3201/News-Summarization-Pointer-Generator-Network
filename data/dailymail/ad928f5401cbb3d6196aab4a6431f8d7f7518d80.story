In the ultimate display of motherly love, Sydney siege hostage Robyn Hope refused to flee the Lindt Chocolate Cafe on Tuesday morning  without her daughter.

Hope's daughter Louisa was being used as a human shield by the deranged gunman when Robyn was given the opportunity to escape with a group of hostages. 

Instead, the 74-year-old devoted mother, who was apparently one of the most vocal people inside the cafe, stayed put, demanding the gunman release her daughter.

Injured hostage: Louisa Hope, 50, was held hostage by the self-styled Sheikh 

'While he was holding her, Louisa's mother was screaming at him telling him to let her go,' Louisa's ex-husband Tony told the Daily Telegraph.

'Louisa was saying, 'Mum, stop it', telling her to keep quiet. Her mum could have escaped apparently but refused to leave her daughter behind. What mother would? They are as close as mother and daughter can be.'

Meanwhile, Robyn's son, Robert Honan, went to sleep with no idea his mother and sister were two of the 18 hostages who were taken during the Sydney siege.

Robyn Hope, the mother of Louisa, was also held hostage in the Lindt cafe 

The Queenslander was woken about 2.30am on Tuesday by a call from his shaken mother, who told him she had been shot and could not find his sister after they were separated in the chaos that followed the end of the siege,The Courier Mail reported. 

Louisa Hope,50, originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, and her  mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning when self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis stormed in about 9.30am.

Monis was brandishing a pump-action shotgun and held hostages inside the cafe for almost 17 hours as police swarmed the area.

Mr Honan had been aware the siege was unfolding but had not considered that his family were part of it as the two women had an appointment he assumed they had attended.

'But they went there [to the cafe] first and never got to where they were meant to be going,' he told News Corp.

Mr Honan said 'they were terrified and upset and had mixed feelings of they're alive'.

The ex-husband and close friend of Ms Hope, who preferred to go by the name Tony V, told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning his former partner was injured during the last moments of the siege.

He told how she was used as a 'human shield' by the gunman just before the crisis came to a bloody end.

'He'd used her for a human shield for most of the time that she was in there,' the ex-husband, who used to live in Bondi but now runs a restaurant in South Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, said.

Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape

'That was just before the young lad was shot when he went to take the gun off the gunman.'

The dramatic siege - considered a terrorist event according to NSW Police Force protocols - came to an end about 2am on Tuesday morning when hostages attempted a mass escape and cafe manager Tori Johnson attempted to grab Monis' weapon.

Monis was falling asleep but woke up as the escape was underway. 

'He [Monis] had dozed off. He was falling asleep,' Tony said.

'Some rustling noises had woke him when the lad was trying to take the gun off him. 

'That's when [Mr Johnson] was shot. Apparently that's when my ex-mother-in-law [Robyn] was then shot in the shoulder and that's when the police then went in... and that's when Louisa was shot in the foot.'

Mr Johnson was killed as well as barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson who died after she was taken to hospital.

At least four people were injured and taken to hospital.

Ms Hope's ex-partner, who spoke to family on Tuesday morning UK time, said the whole incident had been 'very frightening'.

He had some words of support for his injured friend, who he said has been operated on and is recovering in hospital. 

'I'd just give her a hug and just tell her to keep strong,' Tony said. 'She's a strong woman with a lot of faith in God.'
