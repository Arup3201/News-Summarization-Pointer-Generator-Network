Ambulance Paramedics treated the IT professional at the scene before transporting her to Westmead Hospital, where she died about 12.45am.

Her husband did not hear about his wife's death until he arrived in Sydney on Sunday morning.  

'She was walking while talking to Arun on the phone when she said that a suspicious-looking man was following her,' her brother-in-law, Thrijesh Jayachandra, told The Hindu.

'The next moment, he heard her scream for help and then plead with the man not to harm [her] and take all her belongings if he wanted. Seconds later, he heard her scream and say she was stabbed.'

It's believed Prabha got off a train at Parramatta Railway Station about 9pm, before walking along Argyle Street and turning left onto the walkway.

Police believe she was attacked while on the walkway however CCTV footage didn't appear to show anyone following the victim when she left the station.

She sustained a number of injuries, which police believe were inflicted by a sharp-edged weapon.

Nearby resident Arvand Amirian told Nine News he had found Ms Arun with blood all over her body after hearing 'crying screams' that 'didn't sound normal'.

'There was blood covering her face, her neck, her chest - her chest wasn't even moving so that's when I assumed she was gone,' Amirian said.

'I hope God gives the family enough strength to endure this pain.'

Prabha,  who moved to Sydney in 2012 for an off-site project with global technology firm Mindtree, was expected to return to India for a family reunion in April.

'She last called me three days ago, when she said it was taxing for her to stay away from family,' her aunt Bharathi Jayachandra said.

She complained that work pressure was severe, and she planned to return home for good in April.'
