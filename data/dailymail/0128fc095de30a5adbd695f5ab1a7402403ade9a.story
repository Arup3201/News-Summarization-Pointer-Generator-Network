This is the stomach-churning moment a woman is smacked in the face by a basketball and left with a bloody nose as she gets distracted by a cell phone during an NBA game.

Video footage from the Charlotte Hornets and Sacramento Kings match in North Carolina on Wednesday night shows the unidentified female spectator sat front row with a friend.

As she looks at something on a phone through her spectacles, a ball hurtles towards her and knocks her head back with force.

Her glasses are seen flying through the air as fellow spectators attempt to stop the collision with their fingers splayed out.

The clip - captured from the other side of the court - cuts to show the teary-eyed woman mopping her face with tissues.

She appears to have blood on one of her fingers, suggesting a nose bleed.

Despite the injury, she apparently stayed at the Time Warner Cable Arena to watch the remainder of the Kings' 113-106 win.

The faceplanting accident happened in the second quarter when Hornets guard Gerald Henderson tried to avoid catching a hard pass that had been tipped by a Kings player.

The ball sailed through his hands, over Charlotte's bench and into the third row.

Hornets public relations had no information to release on what happened or who the injured spectator was.
