The schoolgirl who went on the run with her married maths teacher has ended their relationship for a boy of her own age.

The girl, who was 15 when she fled to France to start a new life with Jeremy Forrest, 31, had claimed she wanted to have his children and would wait for him until he was released from prison.

But just four months after he was jailed  for child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child, she has found a  new boyfriend.

The schoolgirl, who cannot be named, is pictured with her teacher Jeremy Forrest aboard a Channel ferry as they head to France in September last year

Just weeks ago the girl’s family 
said she wanted to continue her relationship with Forrest after he left 
prison – and they would respect her choice.

In an exclusive interview
 with the Mail in September, the girl’s stepmother condemned him for 
abusing his position of trust as her teacher but said she had stopped 
hating him.

‘She loves him, and as far as we are aware she is just waiting until he comes out of prison,’ said the stepmother.

She said the family would always have misgivings about Forrest but would ultimately respect the girl’s choice of partner.

‘We
 will never feel 100 per cent confident about him,’ she added. ‘I’d like
 [my step-daughter] to meet someone and be happy. If that someone is 
Jeremy, it’s Jeremy. We’ll support her whatever she decides.’

Forrest was jailed for five-and-a-half years for abducting the girl who he first kissed when she was 14-years-old

The 
news of the girl’s change of heart is said to have devastated Forrest, 
who insisted he was not a paedophile and simply fell in love with his 
pupil, who he intended to marry.

He triggered an international 
manhunt last summer when he fled with the girl. He had groomed her from 
when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils.

After taking her 
virginity one week after her 15th birthday in his marital home, they 
left for France, using the names Jack Dean and Gemma Grant.

At first,
 the girl’s devastated family feared she had been kidnapped but soon 
after CCTV footage showed her with her arms around her teacher on board a
 ferry from Dover to Calais.

They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her.

After
 being convicted at Lewes Crown Court in June, Forrest is serving a  
five-and-a-half year sentence and will have to sign the sex offenders’ 
register for life.

Social workers have banned the girl from speaking 
to him until she is 18 so it was left to his father Jim, 60, to break 
the news on Saturday that she had found a new boyfriend.

A source close 
to the family said: ‘He is upset and is finding it very difficult. His 
father told him about the new boyfriend but she can’t speak to him 
herself to break up with him properly.’

In the months after the girl 
was  reunited with her family she refused to live with her natural 
mother, who condemned the relationship with Forrest. She moved in with 
other family members but has since moved back home with her mother and 
three siblings in the south of England.

Friends realised she was in a
 new relationship because she was sending the boy messages on Twitter, 
which she signed off with lots of kiss signs.

Her natural mother told
 a friend: ‘I am so, so glad my daughter is back where she belongs. Now I
 want her to go on and enjoy the things any girl of her age would. I 
have met her new boyfriend quite a few times now. I like him a lot and 
hope they can enjoy being in a relationship together.’

She added: ‘I’m delighted there has been no contact between my daughter and Jeremy Forrest. I’ve longed for her to move on.’

Forrest
 began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles 
when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something 
she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with 
bulimia.

She opened up to him about the break-up of her parents’ 
marriage before he kissed her in a classroom. He took her virginity at 
his home when his wife Emily, 32 – from whom he is now estranged – was 
away. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, which 
they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest.

After Forrest was 
jailed, she said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I don’t want anyone else. I 
want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he’s out, we 
can marry and have children.’

The college student, now 16, claimed she instigated their escape to France, adding: ‘If anything, I groomed him.’
