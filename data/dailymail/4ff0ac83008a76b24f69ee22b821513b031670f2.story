If you are a firm believer that dolls are reserved for children only it's time to review your judgement.

The one-time childhood toy has been given a true fashionista makeover and looks set to knock Barbie off her long reigning throne as cool queen of the doll house.

Meet the Mua Mua Dolls- an amazing set of fashion-inspired dolls hand knitted by young creatives in Bali looking for ways to raise University funds.

Poker face: Lady Gaga's yarn version comes complete with an 'I love Gaga' tag

Founded by Ludovica Virga and a group of girls from a small village in Bali, Mua Mua Dolls take a light hearted look at celebrities and the fashion industry.

From Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour to Valentino and Alexander McQueen, fashion's most famous faces have been recreated in knitted form and come complete with scars and imperfections, which is Ludovica's way of expressing 'the humanity of the fashion world's most elusive leaders'.

But it isn't just fashionable figures on offer, Jay Z, Beyonce and Lady Gaga have also been crafted out of yarn and with Lady Gaga's peroxide hair and Jay Z's trademark flat cap, the dolls bear an uncanny resemblance to their pop star counterparts.

Priced at £85 each, Ludovica has ventured to Milan, Paris and New York to present her creations on  the best stages and it seems the fashion world has taken notice with Karl Lagerfeld even buying his own doll.

Dolls are officially back in fashion.
