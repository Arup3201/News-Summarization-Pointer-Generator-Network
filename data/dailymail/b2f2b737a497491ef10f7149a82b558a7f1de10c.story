A guide to the UK's citizenship test doesn't sound like the most scintillating read.

But Life In The United Kingdom: A Guide For New Residents, published by The Stationary Office, was one of the most borrowed library books last year.

The 180-page book, which covers topics such as the Middle Ages and the British constitution, says it will help new residents 'integrate into society'. It includes a section on the 'values of the UK' and a glossary explaining concepts such as bank holidays and the phone book.

The citizenship test asks applicants 24 questions based on the book. They must get 75 per cent right to pass.

Examples of questions include: 'What important event happened in England in 1066?' and 'What is the capital city of the UK?'. 

The test has been criticised in the past as 'unfit for purpose' as it concentrates too heavily on history and not enough on practical knowledge.

Immigration expert Dr Thom Brooks, of Durham University, criticised it for not mentioning practical issues such as how to register with a GP or how to ring for an ambulance. 

Public Lending Right, which organises payment for authors whose books are lent by libraries, found it was the most borrowed book in London.

Elsewhere, more predictable books were popular; Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown's latest novel Inferno was the most borrowed across the UK.
