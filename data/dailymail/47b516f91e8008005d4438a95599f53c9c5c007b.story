Andrew Flintoff has hinted he might not play cricket again once his stint in the Big Bash League comes to an end.

The former England all-rounder, 37, was originally forced to retire from cricket in 2010 but returned for Lancashire in the T20 Blast last year, before Brisbane Heat offered him a Big Bash contract.

Flintoff has looked a shadow of the legendary international player during the Australian T20 competition - having only scored 74 runs and just three wickets.

Outside of cricket Flintoff appears in a Sky 1 panel show, owns a fish and chip van and recently announced a tour with podcast buddy comedian Clyde Holcroft.

Asked whether he would continue to play once the tournament was over Flintoff said: ‘I don’t know to be honest, I have no idea.

Flintoff has failed to reach the levels that  he showed during his heyday 

The 37-year-old came out of retirement to play T20 cricket with Lancashire in 2014

‘To be playing here (in the Big Bash) was an opportunity and I grabbed it and I have loved it.

‘When I get home I will have to talk to Lancashire and see what their plans are.

‘I have loved it, but the problem is that while the Big Bash is such a condensed programme, in England it is every Friday and I have to work as well.’
