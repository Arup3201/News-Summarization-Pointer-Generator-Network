Accused: Rashpal Chana pictured at Nottingham Crown Court is accused of the manslaughter of Kristiana Logina

A two-year-old girl who died at her mother's home was probably held under a shower head or extremely hot water and was never taken for urgent medical treatment, a court heard.

Kristiana Logina suffered 10 per cent burns to her body when she was held under a scalding hot water which could have reached a maximum of 58 degrees, Nottingham Crown Court heard.

Her mother, Eva Logina, 25, and her then boyfriend, 49-year-old Rashpal Chana, applied creams and bandages to Kristiana's wounds but never took her to be assessed and treated by medical professionals.

The court was told that had they sought medical treatment, the toddler's life could have been saved.

Both are charged with her manslaughter on February 15 last year at the house they shared in Harborne, Birmingham.

Logina, now of Smethwick in West Midlands, also faces a further charge of child cruelty on dates between February 15 2009 and February 15 2010.

She and Chana, also of Smethwick, West Midlands, both deny all charges.

At the start of their trial today, prosecutor Timothy Raggatt QC told the jury of five women and seven men that Kristiana was injured between 10 days and a fortnight before her death and eventually died in the paediatric intensive care unit at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

He said: 'It seems likely that the direct cause may very well have been the application by a shower head unit or extremely hot water.

'The nature and extent of the injuries that she sustained were such that it would have been, or should have been, instantly apparent that she required urgent medical treatment.'

Kristiana's burns were left untreated for such a long period of time that the damaged skin eventually died and began to decay, Mr Raggatt said.

He added: 'The direct cause of her death was something known by the medical profession as septic shock.

'Septic shock means this - it is that your body becomes so infected and debilitated that your organs and vital systems stop working.

'That in its turn leads to infection, organ failure and death.'

Logina, who is from Latvia and came to the UK in 2007 when she was pregnant with Kristiana, initially put her up for adoption after her birth, which led to her being in foster care for a short period.

Mr Raggatt told the court: 'During that that time of foster care Kristiana was a normal happily developing girl.

'After she returned to her mother and after she spent some time with her mother the child deteriorated and went from a happy, bouncy child and went to one who was sullen, sad and depressed and one who was shown little care or affection.'

The trial continues.
