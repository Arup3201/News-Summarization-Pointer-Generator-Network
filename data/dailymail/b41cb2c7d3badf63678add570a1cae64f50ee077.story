Fawlty Towers was hardly the best advert for the hotels of Torquay, but the Devon resort does have some of the best places to stay, says a survey.

Torquay – the setting for Basil Fawlty’s chaotic hotel in the classic TV comedy – has come fifth in a UK league table for best service in hotels.

It scored 8.21 points out of 10 to put it only a little behind the 8.46 achieved by Sheffield at the top of the list compiled from thousands of reviews by the hotel.info company.

Not so bad: Fawlty Towers depicted hotels in Torquay as shambolic but hotels in the town came fifth for offering the best service in a table compiled by hotel.info

Second, on 8.39, was Norwich, with Leeds third, on 8.29, and York fourth, with 8.24. London trailed in at joint-22nd position, with 7.36 points.

Compared with European hotels, the UK fared poorly, failing to make it into the top 20.

This list was headed by Finland and Germany, both with 8.36 points.

Austria was third with 8.35, while Hungary came fourth after scoring 8.31.

The UK's neighbour Ireland was in 11th place with 8.12 points but the UK, with only 7.56 points, was below the 20th-placed nation, the Netherlands, on 7.82 points.

Coastal: Torquay finished closely behind Sheffield in first place, Norwich in second and Leeds third

A hotel.info spokesman said: 'From rats in the restaurant to cream being poured over a guest’s head, Fawlty Towers gave Torquay a less-than-positive image, as far as hotel stays go.

'However, nearly 40 years have passed since then and our latest service quality survey has revealed that the British seaside favourite actually makes it into fifth position for service levels nationally.'

The company added: 'In comparison with mainland Europe, the UK has a lot of catching up to do.'
