The nephew of a couple killed in the Glasgow bin lorry crash has said he does not blame the driver for their deaths and hopes he 'makes a speedy recovery'.

In a series of online messages, Marc Gardiner thanked the emergency services for doing everything possible for 68-year-old Jack and 69-year-old Lorraine Sweeney and their granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, who died in the accident.

He also urged people not to criticise the driver of the lorry that  ploughed in to pedestrians in the city centre and said the messages of support received by the family had meant a lot.

Erin's mother Jacqueline, 43, is thought to have survived because she had gone to withdraw money from a cash machine during the family's Christmas shopping trip.

Mr Gardiner tweeted: 'Been a really emotional and overwhelming day and on behalf of my family I just want to say thank you to everyone around Scotland sending in their condolences and best wishes!

'I hope that the other families that are going through what me and my family are get all the support possible and I hope that the driver of the lorry makes a speedy recovery and understands that it wasn't his fault.

'And a big thanks to all emergency services yesterday for doing everything possible.

'RIP Uncle Jackie, Aunt Lorraine and Erin, love you loads and can't believe you're gone, you'll be truly missed.'

He added: 'It means a lot, that the people of Glasgow are coming together for my family and the other families affected.'

Stephenie Tait, a 29-year-old primary teacher in Glasgow, Jacqueline Morton, 51, a tax worker from the city, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, also died when the council truck mounted the pavement before crashing in to the side of the Millennium Hotel in George Square.

Four people, including two teenage girls, are still being treated in hospital following the accident.

Three females - a 14-year old girl, an 18-year-old and a woman aged 64 - are all being cared for at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

The 14-year-old girl had been in a serious condition but all three are now said to be stable.

A 57-year-old man thought to be the driver is being treated in the Western Infirmary in the west of Glasgow and is also stable.

A statement released by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'Four patients remain in two Glasgow hospitals following Monday's tragic incident in George Square.

'Three patients remain in Glasgow Royal Infirmary: a 14-year-old girl, an 18-year-old female and a 64-year-old woman. All are stable.

'A 57-year-old man is being treated at the Western Infirmary and remains stable.'

More than 600 people packed into the city's St Andrew's Cathedral for a service to remember those who died 

The service was for relatives of the victims, as well as for those who witnessed the crash

The accident has led to a huge outpouring of emotion in the city, with  flowers placed near the scene

The victims of the crash were yesterday remembered at Christmas services across the city, with candles lit and prayers said for all those affected by the tragedy. 

Meanwhile, the festive fairground and ice rink attractions in George Square reopened yesterday as the city tried to return to normal.

A spokesman for Glasgow City Council, said: 'Glasgow City Council, in co-operation with partner agencies, took the decision to reopen George Square in a phased approach which began by providing access to the nativity scene and Christmas Tree.

'It was felt right to reflect on the tragic events that unfolded and close other attractions and activities until Boxing Day, providing a chance for people to pause and pay their respects in their own way over the Christmas period.'
