Crisp winter sunshine marked the beginning of winter this morning after  temperatures dropped to -1C in some parts of the country overnight.

The chillier conditions are due to last for the rest of the week, with England and Wales expected to get as cold as -2C as the winter weather sets in. 

Clear skies are expected throughout most of the UK,  with temperatures a few degrees lower than this time last year.

But forecasters warn the crisp, winter sunshine may come to an end before Christmas, with rain and wind expected as the month goes on.

Elsewhere an amber sunrise lit up the morning skies as seen over the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire which were blanketed by light fog 

The coldest temperatures last night were seen in Scotland, where -1.7C was recorded in Balmoral. England and Wales were, expectedly, milder, though chillier air lingered in western areas. 

A change will be felt throughout the country today after a relatively warmer weekend, the Met Office said. 

'There'll be a lot of crisp, winter sunshine for with Tuesday night into Wednesday morning expected to be the coldest at between -1 and -2C.  

'Particularly in the south east corner it'll feel pretty cold, temperatures will not get much higher than 7 or 8C and there'll be a lot of cloud around which will make it feel colder. The feel of the day will be much different,' said forecaster Helen Roberts. 

'The bulk of England and Wales will be cloudy and not very warm.' 

Snow is expected in the Highlands, though it is too soon to predict whether or not the rest of the UK is on track for a white Christmas. 

'Our detailed forecasts are only a week or so ahead. Generally there is snow forecast on the hills in Scotland this week but it is unlikely in England and Wales. 

Earlier the hills looked bleaker, with thicker fog rolling over trees and shrubs before piercing winter sunshine broke through the mist

Warm autumn weather has brought about early sightings of frogspawn and blossom. 

Spawn was seen in North Predannack Downs nature reserve in Cornwall on November 21, the earliest sighting at the site since 2005. 

Rangers at the trust fear the frogs have been confused by the weather and that their spawn is now at risk of being killed for winter temperatures.   

'Although spring is generally arriving earlier, to receive a frogspawn sighting before winter has properly begun is highly unusual,' said 

Dr Kate Lewthwaite.

'Sadly it is unlikely the spawn will now survive the frosts we are experiencing.

'We need people to keep adding their valuable information to our survey to allow scientists to learn whether frogs are able to adapt or not.

Elsewhere trees are blooming with pale pink blossoms. 

The flowers have started to sprout earlier than usual, with one in full bloom pictured in Cambridge.

For the first two weeks of December however it is expected to be slightly colder than usual throughout the country. 

'Next weekend onwards through until mid December temperatures will rise again to nearer to what is normal for this time of year, around about 7.2C. 

'There's quite a lot of dry weather, it's generally more unsettled in Scotland and northern Ireland. 

'For the latter part of the month it might be more unsettled with some wet and windy weather, temperatures will generally stay around average though with some colder spells at times.' 

This week's weather is slightly colder than what was seen in 2013, when the average temperature for December in England was more than 9C. 

But the unseasonably warm temperatures over the last few months made autumn one of the balmiest on record, and brought on the early arrival of a fall of lambs, according to one farmer. 

David Coupland said he was convinced the unexpected birth of two sets of the animals had been encouraged by the warm autumn weather. 

The farmer from County Durham welcomed the Suffolk Cross Oxford breed twins and one pure bred Oxford Down lamb last weekend, a month expected. 

'The first set were born at 7am on Sunday morning and the other three were born at 3.30am on Monday. We're about a month early with the lambing - we didn't get our earliest lambs until the end of December last year. 

'I don't know why it's happened, maybe it's down to the funny weather we've been having but I was quite amazed when I realised.  

'It was a busy weekend for me as I was constantly checking on them but it's lovely to see the little lambs there.'

The unexpected arrival of a fall of lambs in County Durham convinced one farmer the balmier autumn weather had had an effect on lambing 

The animals, welcomed by farmer Dave Coupland, arrived a month earlier than last year, to the surprise of those on the farm 

The five new lambs join 37 sheep on the farm in County Durham. It is the first time the farmer has welcomed a fall in November
