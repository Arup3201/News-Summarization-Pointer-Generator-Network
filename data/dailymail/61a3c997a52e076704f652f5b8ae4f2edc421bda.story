Teenager Richard Fellows drowned after getting into difficulty while swimming at a busy beauty spot

Tributes have been paid to a teenage boy who drowned after getting into difficulty while swimming at a busy beauty spot with friends on one of the sunniest days of the year.

Richard Fellows, 15, was pulled from the water by rescue crews at Arrow Valley Countryside Centre, in Redditch, Worcestershire, yesterday following a two-hour search effort.

Friends desperately tried to help the teenager while the park was full of people on one of the sunniest days of the year so far.

One boy, who asked not to be identified, said: 'My brother was with Richard in the water. Richard got into trouble and the others went to try and help him, but they couldn't.'

Emergency services managed to pull Richard from the water, and performed emergency resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead when he arrived at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch.

Ambulance staff also treated two other teenage boys who were recovered from the water.

Charlie Rogers, 18, Richard's former neighbour and classmate at Trinity High School said: 'We just can't believe what's happened. It doesn't seem real.

'Richard had a lovely personality. You'd only have to look at him and he'd make you laugh. It's so unreal that he's gone.'

Within hours, almost 1,500 people had joined a Facebook group set up in memory of Richard, who was a part-time shelf stacker at Tesco.

A combined response unit of police, fire and ambulance services, including a Midlands Air Ambulance helicopter, attended the scene after they received the call at around 12.20pm.

The authorities also sent the ambulance service's hazardous area response team.

Wearing wet suits, they joined other emergency services in a two-hour search of the lake's waters.

The teenager was eventually located and brought ashore where medics started resuscitation and advance life support, according to the ambulance service spokesman.

An ambulance with a doctor on board then took the teenager to Redditch's Alexandra Hospital, which had been pre-alerted to his serious condition.

A spokesperson from West Midlands Ambulance service said: 'Three teenage boys were reportedly in difficulty in a lake at the park and a call was made to the emergency services at approximately 12.20pm.

'An ambulance crew, together with a 
responder paramedic; the Hazardous Area Response Team; MERIT and 
Midlands Air Ambulance from Cosford were sent to the scene.

'Two
 boys were recovered from the water and treated for minor injuries by 
ambulance staff. They were later discharged to the care of parents at 
the scene.

The schoolboy got into trouble along with two others who were also pulled from the river and survived

The school children had been swimming in the River Arrow, near Redditch in Worcestershire

'The specialist HART team were in wet suits and joined other emergency services in a search of the water for nearly two hours.

'A third teenager was eventually located and brought to safety where medics commenced immediate resuscitation and advance life support.

'The patient was taken by ambulance to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch.

'The hospital was alerted to the serious condition of the patient. A MERIT doctor travelled to the hospital with the patient and Crew.

'It is understood that the patient was later confirmed deceased at the hospital.'

Superintendent
 Kevin Purcell, the North Worcestershire Police Commander, said: 'Our 
thoughts are with Richard's family after this tragic incident.'

The
 2.5 mile-wide country park features walkways and a play area and is a 
popular attraction with families and youngsters with the large 29-acre 
man-made Arrow Valley Lake at its centre.

Police have also issued a warning to youngsters not to cool off in rivers and ponds on hot days.

Inspector Ian Joseph, of West Mercia Police, said: 'This was a dreadful tragedy and our thoughts are with Richard's family and friends.

'While the investigation is at a very early stage, it was a beautiful spring day and it appears the boys went into part of the river which forms a pool by the weir for a swim.

'Unfortunately the water there is deep and cold, and Richard did not resurface.

'I cannot reiterate strongly enough that swimming in a warm indoor pool is very different to swimming in open water, and even the strongest of swimmers can get into difficulty in rivers, canals, ponds, and quarries.

'Aside from the water being cold and deep, there may be strong currents, and submerged objects can also pose problems.

'Please, do not swim in open water, no matter how hot the weather. It is incredibly dangerous.'
