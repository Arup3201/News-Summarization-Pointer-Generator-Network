 

Roma are weighing up a January move for Petr Cech.

Jose Mourinho insists Chelsea have yet to receive any offers for the 32-year-old goalkeeper despite mooted interest from Liverpool, Inter Milan, Arsenal, Paris St Germain and Real Madrid. 

Cech has played in the Champions League against Maribor and is valued at around £7million.

The Czech Republic international has found himself playing second fiddle to Thibaut Courtois this season after the Belgian returned to the club following three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid.

Speaking in November Mourinho said: 'On my desk, normally from my board's desk the information arrives, I have zero. Zero proposals. 

'At this moment, Petr Cech is our goalkeeper and has a contract for two more years.

'He's a fantastic professional and puts the team's interests first. Not once has Petr Cech knocked on my door to inform me of his desire to accept some proposal. This is my truth. Nothing more I can say.'

Cech's agent has also said the likelihood of him moving in January is slim but Roma will weigh up their options once their Champions League fate is sealed against Manchester City next week. 

Roma are also among clubs to have made enquiries about Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches.

The Romania international has been out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino and has started just three Premier League games this season, including Sunday's win against Everton where he played as a makeshift right back.
