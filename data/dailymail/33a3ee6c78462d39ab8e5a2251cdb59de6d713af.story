In most office romances, the torrid details don’t usually travel much further than the water cooler.

Alas, as Amanda Rosenberg can testify, the steel-and-glass Googleplex  in California isn’t like most offices, and her married lover, multibillionaire Google founder Sergey Brin, isn’t like most bosses.

So rather than remaining under wraps in Silicon Valley, news of their relationship has ended up all over the internet – and for that, the 27-year-old ex-Marlborough pupil may have Brin’s wife Anna Wojcicki to thank.

For the way the story of Miss Rosenberg’s romance with 40-year-old Brin – one of the world’s richest men, with a £15billion fortune – came out is rather intriguing.

relationship with Google co-founder Sergey Brin exploded into public 
attention this week

Split: Brin, 40, pictured with his wife Anna Wojcicki, 
also 40. One of the journalists who broke the story for U.S. 
technology website All Things D is the partner of a Google executive who
 is a close friend of Miss Wojcicki

The relationship was first revealed in an article on US technology website All Things D. Some of the reporting on the piece was carried out by the site’s co-executive editor, Kara Swisher.

Miss Swisher’s partner is Megan Smith, a Google executive who is a close friend of Miss Wojcicki, 40.

On top of that, Miss Smith works at a division of the search engine giant dedicated to products including Google glass – which Miss Rosenberg promotes.

On the same day, the website published a story about the departure of high-flying Google executive Hugo Barra.

Marketing manager Miss Rosenberg dated Mr Barra shortly before her romance with Brin began. This week, he left the company to join a phone firm in China.

His departure followed ‘a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another Googler,’ All Things D reported.

In the wake of this rather complicated love ‘quadrangle’, no doubt employees inside Google are taking a rather wry look at the firm’s code of conduct.

It states: ‘If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.

‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google?

‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’

Yesterday it was reported that Miss Rosenberg had been transferred to another department within Google ‘to be even further from Sergey in the chain of command’.

Confusingly, another report quoted a Google spokesman saying she had not moved and ‘remains in her current position’. Either way, she has gone to ground and has not been answering calls.

But thanks to her eagerness to embrace social networking sites, we know rather a lot about Miss Rosenberg.

According to posts on her blog, she was born in Hong Kong and raised in London. She refers to herself as a ‘Chinese Jew’ – a ‘Chew’. Her mother is from Hong Kong, her father is British.

She boarded at £31,000-a-year Marlborough College with Kate and Pippa Middleton and Princess Beatrice, and has worked for Google since she graduated with a communications degree from Leeds University. 

She was initially based in London, before moving to San Francisco to work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre last year. She has since been promoting Google Glass, glasses which enable users to film and broadcast everything they see – to the concern of privacy campaigners.

Her social networking pages are filled with photographs of her modelling the glasses, and one shows her meeting rapper Tinie Tempah. 

In another, rather oddly, she is wearing a mask from the film Iron Man and holding a Spider-Man toy.

If she ends up at the centre of what could be the most expensive divorce in history, she might need some superpowers of her own. The precise timings and possible overlaps of her romance with Brin are not clear.

It has been confirmed that Brin and his wife, who have a four-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter, separated several months ago.

But whether Miss Rosenberg was the catalyst for the split is, naturally, subject to much speculation.

Neither Brin or Miss Wojcicki has filed for divorce – yet.

If they divorce, Californian law suggests their fortune would have to be halved. To complicate matters, however, they have reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement.

Even if that falls through, Brin and Miss Rosenberg would hardly be short of cash – they would still have £7.5billion to get by on.
