A group of teenagers who were injured in a stabbing rampage at their Pennsylvania high school last week have returned to their campus for the first time.

Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville re-opened to students Tuesday morning for a walk-through ahead of the resumption of classes Wednesday, and some victims were nervous about reliving the frantic experience.

Sophomore Alex Hribal, 16, has been charged with stabbing 21 other students and a security guard in the attack last Wednesday after he allegedly bolted down hallways and into multiple classrooms wielding a knife in each hand. But now the blood-stained floors and piercing cries are gone.

Michael Spila who was stabbed in the back said he was concerned he might have flashbacks.

'Mentally, I'm still shocked from what happened,' he told WPXI.

'I was kind of nervous because I was 
afraid I might start freaking out or something because you don't know 
what would happen if you walked in and had flashbacks. And luckily 
nothing happened.'

Gracey Evans, watched in
 horror as Hribal allegedly plunged a knife into the back of her friend 
Brett Hurt while he bravely shielded her during the stabbing spree.

'It was different — but a good different,' the 17-year-old junior told NBC News of returning to the scene of the attack Tuesday.

Evans and friends gathered around Hurt and linked arms for a photograph. The students waited for the 16-year-old, who suffered a bruised lung in the attack, to arrive so they could go in together, showing him their support.

Evans said Hurt was on the verge of tears and had to use a wheelchair to navigate the halls.

The students spoke with several teachers who were there when the early morning stabbing unfolded.

Warning signs: Suspect Alex Hribal, 16, is led from his arraignment after he was charged with four counts of attempted murder as an adult. Authorities believe he threatened two students before carrying out the attack last Wednesday

Terror: Twenty one students were injured in Wednesday's blood bath, as well as a security guard. The two students Hribald allegedly threatened were not injured

Evacuation: Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing. They are due to resume school on Wednesdau

They told the teens they were sorry about what happened and provided tissues and candies in all classrooms.

'It's hard for them,' Evans told NBC of the teachers, 'but harder for us.'

Parents were invited to visit Tuesday to help their children deal with the potentially traumatic experience. Counselors and therapy dogs were on campus to help students process.

The
 return to school comes after it was revealed that detectives believe 
Hribal threatened two students by phone before the attack, according to a
 search warrant. Neither was one of the victims.

The warrant, obtained hours after last
 Wednesday's rampage, said two students received 'threatening phone 
messages and completed calls' from someone believed to be Hribal.

It said the threat of violence contained an expletive.

District Attorney John Peck said the two male students who got the calls were not among those stabbed or slashed in the attack, which occurred minutes before the start of classes at Franklin Regional High School.

Neither Peck nor the warrant say when the calls were made. Murrysville police Chief Thomas Seefeld previously said investigators were looking into a threatening phone call the night before the assaults.

'The caller is believed to be the 
actor because of the subsequent conduct of the actor coming to school 
and attacking numerous individuals,' the warrant said.

Seefeld
 noted Monday that police had not definitively linked the calls to the 
16-year-old suspect but were seeking phone records to determine if they 
came from a phone he could have used.

Defense attorney Patrick Thomassey did not return calls Monday from The Associated Press. But he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which first reported the contents of the search warrant: 'I don't know of those phone calls.'

He had previously told the AP that Hribal's parents weren't aware of any threatening calls the night before the attacks.

The warrant indicates detectives seized three video game systems and games, a wooden kitchen knife-holder, some notebook paper believed to contain Hribal's handwriting and two computers.

Four students remained hospitalized Monday, three in critical condition. The fourth was upgraded to fair condition.

The high school's teachers attended a 
counseling session at a nearby church before returning to the school for
 the first time Monday, part of a three-day effort by school officials 
and a hired crisis management team to fully reopen the school for 
classes Wednesday.

Earlier, some parents said their children were eager to get back to school.

'That's where he wants to be, to be with his friends,' Jeff Mauro said of his son, Jamie, a ninth-grader who witnessed some of the stabbings. 'This has been a learning experience that we have to love each other — all of us.'

Laura Thompson said her children 'seem to think they're going to be fine. But I think it's going to be different when they're back in that environment.'

Thomassey has said he plans to waive Hribal's right to a preliminary hearing next week.

After that, he said he would ask a judge to move the case to juvenile court, a move prosecutors are expected to contest. Thomassey said that request will be based largely on a mental health evaluation by a doctor he's hired.
