'Just friends'. With those two words, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has tried to end suggestions that she and businessman David Panton are an item.

A spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia on Friday that 'no, no they are just friends, as soon as the stories (about them being in a relationship) appeared the Minister made it clear that they are friends'.

And what of stepping out in style together in the glitzy Birdcage on Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington? 'They attended the race day just as friends. The Minister rightly keeps her private life private but the reports of a relationship were incorrect.'

But on Tuesday the focus was on Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's apparent new relationship, rather than her policies.

By her side at the Melbourne Cup Carnival was businessman David Panton, and the pair are said to have been dating for about six months, the Daily Telegraph reported.

'The Minister had never said that (they were in a relationship) it’s not true, and it’s not true that she said that they were together,' claimed the spokeswoman.

Mr Panton's two adult daughters Sally and Laura also accompanied him to Flemington for day two of the Cup Carnival.

A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham.

A recent Fairfax poll found Ms Bishop (left) and Tony Abbott (right) both have 20 per cent support from voters in preferred leadership stakes

As Australia's first female Foreign Minister and the Liberal Party's first female Deputy Leader, Ms Bishop's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months.

A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop is now level with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the preferred leadership stakes, both with 20 per cent support.

This has been attributed to her strong showing on the international stage - particularly throughout the MH17 crisis in Ukraine - and her calm handling of government affairs in Australia.

After the figures were released on Tuesday - Melbourne Cup day - she attended Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, accompanied by Mr Panton, amid reports they had been dating for six months.

But it appears Ms Bishop has no plans of taking the country's top job as she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she is 'living the dream and loving the job'.

'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said.

'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.'

Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 per cent in June to 20 per cent.

But both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister fall into second place behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who remains the overall choice with 35 per cent backing from voters.

The Fairfax poll of 1,401 people, carried out between Thursday and Sunday, found female voters heavily favoured Mr Turnbull or Ms Bishop.

Ms Bishop married Perth property developer Neil Gillam in 1983 but divorced in 1988.

Afterwards the Foreign Minister dated former Lord Mayor of Perth Dr Peter Nattrass for at least 12 years but denies the suggestions she has a new man in her life.

When quizzed by her staff as to the veracity of the relationship stories, Ms Bishop told them 'we're just friends'.
