A mother who is documenting her three-year-old autistic son’s journey to forming a bond with his pet Labradoodle through a series of heart-warming photos says she’s already spotted things in common between the adorable pair.

‘They both like to chew things and confined spaces,’ Cassandra Merrigan, 29, told Daily Mail Australia.

And little Alex thinks pet Ollie makes a great pillow: ‘Ollie has got that really lovely fleece and Alex likes how it feels. You will see Alex rubbing his feet all over Ollie.’

When the cheeky three-year-old was diagnosed with autism this year Cassandra said she was heartbroken but not surprised as she’d had concerns about his speech since he was a toddler.

A short while later, after the death of the South Sydney family’s husky cross dog, the  graphic designer started looking at pets that were suitable for autistic children.

That’s when she came across 12-month-old black Labradoodle Ollie through Smartpups, an Australian charity that trains assistance dogs for special needs children.

‘They try their best to match the dog to the child, so they wouldn’t put a hyperactive dog to a hyper child like Alex,’ Cassandra told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Ollie is a pretty sedate dude as far as dogs go.’

The highly-trained Labradoodle was put into training for six months, housed with a foster family and sent to puppy bootcamp before he took on his very important role of helping Alex.

Cassandra describes Alex as ‘action packed’ and said he needed to be matched with a dog who would suit him.

‘He’s never sitting still, he’s got a very cheeky sense of humour, he's a very strong non-verbal communicator even though he can’t talk, and he’s strong willed.’

As well as autism, Alex also has a sensory processing disorder and has been in speech therapy since an early age.

‘His brain doesn’t interpret sensory stimulation the same, he craves movements and deep pressure. He would run full pelt into a wall and not slow down just to get that sensory feedback, spinning in circles and hand flapping,’ Cassandra explained.

Ollie has come as a relief to the family, because he’s an extra pair of eyes to watch over Alex and is even a trained tracker.

‘Ollie watches him wherever he goes, if Alex goes walkabout he can track him,’ the mother-of-two said. 

Cassandra described the Labrador and poodle cross as a bit of a 'primadonna'

Alex's mum Cassandra Merrigan said he likes walking with a harness with Ollie but also likes to hold her hand

The family were given four days with a trainer as part of the handover of Ollie: ‘They teach you how to handle him. 

'As a certified assistance animal we have legal requirements to meet like making sure he is appropriate in public, not sniffing in supermarkets or trying to eat food in café’s and not going to toilet in public.’

Although the Labradoodle is still a puppy - with a weakness for tennis balls - Cassandra said he is ‘unbelievable’.

‘He toilets on command… but Ollie was the first Labradoodle that they trained. He’s quite different to a lab… he’s got a bit of primadonna complex… now his fur is growing back his character is showing.’

However, Ollie didn’t come cheap.

The family had to raise a minimum of $15,000 of his $25,000 cost before they could bring him home and Cassandra received huge financial help from her sister and the local community.

She even sold some of Alex’s ‘beautiful’ artwork to help raise the money.

Alex and Ollie’s bond is slowly developing but Cassandra said she tries not to worry about the time it takes because Alex ‘didn’t even realise his sister was alive until she was 12 months old and walking’.

‘Emery is full of spunk and she just pins him down when she wants a hug,’ Cassandra laughed.

 ‘Alex takes a long time to bond with things and for them to become part of his world.

‘He will pat and give a little cuddle but they haven’t had a huge chance yet… it can take to six/eight months. He’s developmentally around 18 months so he hasn’t got the language skills for me to explain “this is Ollie this is what he does”,’ she reasoned.

One of Cassandra’s fondest moments since Ollie joined their family was when Alex curled up with him ‘and used him as a pillow’.

‘Alex initiated it and Ollie is still getting used to Alex because Alex is an incredibly random child but Ollie didn’t even flinch when he got in the doggy bed.’
