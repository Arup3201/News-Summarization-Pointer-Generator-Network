A 4,300 year-old wall painting has been found in a tomb for a ‘priest’ in Egypt.

The find was made about 1,000 feet (300 metres) to the east of the Great Pyramid of Giza, containing depictions of ancient life.

It was found alongside statues that indicated the occupant was an important individual.

A wall painting, dating back over 4,300 years, has been discovered in a tomb (pictured) located just east of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The painting shows vivid scenes of life, including boats sailing south on the Nile River, a bird hunting trip in a marsh and a man named Perseneb with his wife and dog

The ancient Egyptian afterlife is one of the earliest known recorded belief systems in history.

People
 believed that when a person died their soul known as ka - or body 
double - and the ba - their personality - would go to the Kingdom of the
 Dead.

While
 their soul stayed in the Fields of Aaru, Osiris - the god of the 
afterlife - demanded work in return for his protection, which is why you
 often see farming scenes inside tombs.

Statues
 were placed in tombs to serve as substitutes for a person. In order to 
reach the afterlife, a person had to have a pure heart as well as recite
 passwords, spells and forumlae from the Book of the Dead.

People
 believed that in the Hall of Two truths the heart was weighed and if it
 was lighter than the Shu feather, they could pass on - or be destroyed 
by a demon.

Mummification
 and the sarcophagus was a requirement for being able to access the 
afterlife and the Fields of Yalu. The 'opening of the mouth' ceremony 
was of importance as well as the presence of objects such as jewellery 
to keep a body safe on its dangerous journey.

The tomb is thought to have been built about 2450 to 2350 BC in the middle or late fifth dynasty, a time within the Old Kingdom, Egypt's first sustained period of civilisation.

Tombs of this sort were created for important indivudals during the Old Kingdom from about 2650 to 2150 BC.

This is also the perod when the Giza pyramids were built.

Although the tomb was originally found in the 19th century, it was not until recent restoration work by Russian archaeologists that the painting was discovered.

‘Known since the 19th century, the [tomb] could hardly present any new principal features,’ Maksim Lebedev of the Russian State University for Humanities told Live Science.

‘Therefore, it was a real surprise to discover an Old Kingdom painting on the eastern wall of the central room.'

The team will release further images of the painting in the coming weeks as more of it is revealed.

Made of white plaster it had been covered by soot and dirt, from not only nearby industrialisation but also people living in the tomb.

Despite only 30 per cent being preserved, researchers were able to recreate the scenes that were left, with a hint of symbolic meaning.

Archaeologists have found thew previously hidden painting in an ancient tomb near Cairo in Egypt. The tomb belongs to a 'priest' named Persaneb. It has been known of for centuries but the painting has only just been found as it was buried beneath soot and dirt

The painting depicts what life was like 4,300 years ago in Egypt. It shows boats sailing south on the Nile and also agricultural images. The painting could also have symbolic meaning for life in ancient Egypt. Inside the tomb were also found statues of the 'priest' including his wife and what looks like a dog (pictured)

At the top of the painting ships sail south on the Nile, possibly heralding the return of a person of power from the north, which represents a person's high status.

Other parts of the painting shown agricultural scenes such as plowing and sowing.

And one part shows Perseneb with his wife and what appears to be his dog, while another section seems to show a marsh scene where a man on a boat is bird hunting.

Exactly who Perseneb’s position was in ancient Egypt, however, is unknown, although inscriptions indicate he was a 'priest' and a 'steward'.

Tombs of this sort were usually made for important individuals, especially ones with statues, so it is likely he was someone of some stature.

There are three rooms in the tomb - an offering room, central room and burial chamber - and 11 statutes are strewn across the rooms showing Perseneb and his family.

The tomb is thought to have been built about 2450 to 2350 BC in the middle or late fifth dynasty, a time within the Old Kingdom, Egypt's first sustained period of civilisation. Tombs of this sort were created for important individuals during the Old Kingdom from about 2650 to 2150 BC, also when the Giza pyramids were built
