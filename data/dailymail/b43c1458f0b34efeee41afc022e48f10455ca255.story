Scotland Yard was last night under intense pressure to look closer at the mysterious circumstances surrounding the horrific death plunge of a tycoon.

Scot Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich – including Russian oligarchs – was impaled on railings after falling four storeys from a window on Monday.

He had been at the centre of one of Britain’s most notorious divorce cases which had led to his imprisonment for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth to his ex-wife, Michelle.

Mrs Young, 49, has continued to doggedly pursue her ex husband for money and yesterday recently employed Nevyan Intelligence Services as part of her determined attempts to track down Mr Young’s funds.

Police originally said within hours of his body’s discovery there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

But last night detectives were under pressure re-investigate the fall amid fears they discounted foul play too soon. Officers have refused to say if he left a note. Some friends of Mr Young were also sceptical about whether he would have taken his own life.

One of them, who visited the scene of his death yesterday, said: ‘He was a great man and a good father who has been let down by the British legal system. We don’t know if it was suicide yet.’

One associate of Mr Young’s said: ‘I hope this [Mr Young’s death] makes people realise now that there was no money, he didn’t have any money. It is very unpleasant.’

Mr Young’s body was found by residents in upmarket Marylebone, central London, at 5pm Monday afternoon.

He had fallen 60ft on to the iron railings and firefighters had to cut through the metal with an angle grinder before the body could be removed.

Neighbours said they believed Mr Young was alone in the £3million duplex flat when he fell, though they said his fiancé, American model Noelle Reno, 30, had been at the property earlier in the day.

In a statement yesterday, Miss Reno said she was ‘distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend’.

The couple, who met in 2008, became engaged after Mr Young proposed while they were filming an episode of an American reality television programme, called Ladies of London.

But their relationship remained overshadowed by the divorce battle which sparked a six-year court fight and ended in a £20million settlement for Mrs Young and the jailing of Mr Young last year for contempt of court for refusing to reveal his wealth.

She said she was too distressed to comment yesterday and was instead focusing on comforting their two daughters, Sasha, 21, and Scarlet, 19, at the central London flat they share.

‘We are just in shock, we don’t know what to say,’ she said. Earlier she said she and her daughters had been ‘to hell and back’.

Another friend of Mr Young suggested he was financially struggling and had borrowed tens of thousands of pounds before he went to jail for contempt of court, saying: ‘Scot was completely broke and needed cash to tide himself over.

'There was a date set when Scot promised to pay the money back, but it came and went and then he went to prison.

Mr Young's body was found by horrified residents in Marylebone on Monday afternoon. He had fallen 60ft onto the iron railings below his flat and police moved quickly to hide the distressing scene from onlookers

‘When Scot was released he promised he would pay him back but he repeatedly failed to do so.’

A female friend of Mr and Mrs Young pointed to his one-time friendship with the late Russian tycoon Boris Beresovsky as something that should be investigated by police.

She said: ‘The police need to look at this and the death of Boris Berezovsky again.’

In November last year a judge ordered Mr Young was ordered him to pay her £20million after ruling he had ‘hidden’ his wealth from the court.

During the divorce battle, Mr Young, had claimed he was ‘penniless’ with debts of £28million after his business empire imploded.

He claimed to have lost millions in a mysterious property deal in Russia called Project Moscow.

Mr Berezovsky, who died in mysterious circumstances last year, was known to be an investor in the scheme.
