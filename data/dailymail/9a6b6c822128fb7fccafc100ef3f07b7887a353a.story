Top of the class: Sixth formers who achieve the best A-Level results will have extra cause for celebration

Tens of thousands of school leavers with good A-levels face missing out on top universities, which are rejecting applicants with grades lower than ABB.

Sixth-formers receiving their results in a fortnight will be divided into a two-tier clearing system.

Those with the highest grades will find a large number of places in a range of courses on offer.

But those with grades equivalent to ABC or less will find undergraduate offers severely restricted, a Daily Mail survey has found.

Students who miss out will have to settle for courses at less prestigious universities or put their lives on hold while they resit exams or take a gap year.

In previous years, universities have been limited in the number of students with top grades that they can take.

This provided an opportunity for lower grade students to get in.

However, this restriction has now been dropped and the prestigious universities have been told they can take as many students as they like with grades of ABB and above.

Competition for places is intense as grade inflation means around 27 per cent of A-level candidates got A or A* grades last year and around half were awarded Bs.

Elite universities including Oxford and University College London have already stated they will not take part in clearing.

But other prestigious Russell Group institutions have confirmed they are looking to harvest top students through the system.

The University of Exeter said it wanted ‘as many suitably qualified applicants as possible’.

The University of Sheffield said it was ‘looking to recruit high quality students through adjustment and clearing this year’.

Two tier: Tens of thousands of sixth formers face missing out on their first choice of university after the rules governing how many top students could be accepted were relaxed

Birmingham has said it is ‘definitely’ taking part in clearing and Warwick, Leeds, Manchester and Southampton recently indicated they were likely to have places available.

Malcolm Trobe, deputy secretary general of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There is a concern that universities will not be able to accept applicants on some courses who just miss getting an ABB, when in previous years they might have been able to accommodate them.

‘This is why it is so important that students have an insurance offer that actually gives them a safety net.

'About 40 per cent of students last year went for second choices that needed at least the same grades as their first choice. These are the students who are going to be in a muddle.’

A Universities and Colleges Admissions Service spokesman said: ‘If an applicant does not meet the conditions of their offer, acceptance is at the discretion of the institution.’
