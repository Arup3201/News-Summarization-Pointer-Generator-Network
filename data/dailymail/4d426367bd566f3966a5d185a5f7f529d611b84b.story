A Polish student and part-time model was gassed to death in a bath when a faulty boiler filled the bathroom with carbon monoxide.

Klaudia Wysocka, 23, from Goldap, a town in north-eastern Poland, had moved to the nearby city of Olsztyn to study microbiology.

She was found slumped in the bath tub when her flatmates became worried after knocking on the door an hour after she had gone in and not getting a reply.

Medics tried desperately to save Klaudia Wysocka but she died on the way to hospital

When they broke the door down they found her unconscious.

Described as intelligent and beautiful, her friends and boyfriend tried to resuscitate her before calling an ambulance.

After the tragedy, her friend Magda Miechowicz, 22, said: 'She was so full of life and had so many ambitions.

'She wanted to be a model but was incredibly intelligent and also wanted to fight against viruses and bacteria so people could lead healthier lives.

'We had complained about the gas boiler and our landlord said he would fix it.

'Unfortunately, that has come too late.'

The local fire brigade has issued a warning about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. Pictured is one of the fire fighters who worked at the scene of the tragedy

Klaudia was taken to hospital but died on the way.

A hospital spokesman said: 'She died of carbon-monoxide poisoning because of the faulty gas heater.'

A fire brigade spokesman warned: 'Carbon monoxide is colourless, odourless and tasteless.

'It can be produced by appliances and will be deadly if in a confined space such as a small bathroom in which the door is closed and locked.

'It stops the body being able to absorb oxygen, eventually leading to death.'
