New sex abuse claims against Jimmy Savile are being made weekly, it emerged today as the number of hospitals under investigation over the scandal more than doubled to 32.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said an extra 19 hospitals had been caught up in the scandal, in addition to 13 already subject to an urgent inquiry.

It suggests the disgraced former BBC 
presenter’s abuse of children on NHS premises may have been more regular
 and more serious than those offences committed at the Corporation.

Inquiry: The scope of NHS investigations into abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile has been widened again

Investigations were first launched into 
Savile's activities at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General Infirmary when details of his years of abuse emerged last year. It was then widened to include 10 hopsitals across the country.

But in a written statement today, Mr Hunt said that Scotland Yard inquiries had unearthed more claims of abuse at another 19 hospitals. They include Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, London and Whitby.

Detectives investigating the cases of 
abuse gleaned further information that patients at the 19 hospitals 
could have been targeted by Savile and so further inquiries were 
ordered.

The 19 additional hospitals under investigation are:Barnet General HospitalBooth Hall Children's HospitalDe La Pole HospitalDryburn Hospital Hammersmith HospitalLeavesden Secure Mental HospitalMarsden HospitalMaudsley HospitalNorth Manchester General HospitalOdstock HospitalPinderfields HospitalPrestwich Psychiatric HospitalQueen Victoria Hospital, East GrinsteadRoyal Free Hospital, LondonRoyal Victoria Infirmary, NewcastleSeacroft Hospital, LeedsSt Mary's Hospital, CarshaltonWhitby Memorial HospitalWythenshawe Hospital

Mr Hunt said former barrister Kate Lampard, who was asked to oversee the Department of Health's investigations into Savile, will make sure the inquiries are properly carried out.

Mr Hunt said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service has completed its document review and transferred various material concerning Jimmy Savile and the NHS to the Department of Health.

"The information has been passed on to the relevant hospital trust for further investigation as appropriate. Names of the hospitals are taken from the information received.

'These include hospitals that may have closed in which case the information has been passed on to the legacy organisation.

'Kate Lampard, who was asked to provide independent assurance of the NHS investigations on behalf of the Department of Health, will provide general assurance of the quality of all reports in her final assurance report.

'We expect the final reports of all the investigations to be completed by June 2014, with publication sooner if that is possible.'

Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is 
believed to have abused hundreds of children. He had a bedroom at Stoke 
Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and 
widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.

The
 wave of allegations made against him sparked the launch of the 
Operation Yewtree police investigation, which is also looking into 
claims about others linked to him as well as separate allegations about a
 number of high-profile figures.

Lawyers say they are receiving fresh claims against Savile every week. Alan Collins, who is acting for about 80 alleged victims of the disgraced presenter, told the Standard: 'People are still coming forward. We are getting half a dozen new queries a week in connection with Savile and other people.'

He has been interviewing the latest alleged victim who is a woman who now lives in Los Angeles.

The Royal Free Hospital in London and North Manchester General Hospital are among the hospitals now under investigation

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said reports into the scale of Savile's campaign of abuse in hospitals will be published by June next year

Lawyers representing some of his victims have claimed Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises and in some cases much worse.

Liz
 Dux, head of abuse at Slater and Gordon Lawyers, who represents 72 
potential Savile victims, said in October: 'While the victims are encouraged by 
news that the NHS inquiries will be comprehensive investigations of 
other institutions that may have been involved, the news that the 
time-frame for concluding the investigation has been extended until next
 June will be met with dismay.

'My
 clients all need closure and whilst we welcome a detailed understanding
 of how Savile was able to operate unchecked for so many years, at the 
same time we need to recognise that until these reports are concluded 
their suffering continues.'

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'It is essential that all the information is considered and investigations are thorough in order to learn the lessons about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending.'
