Samuel Eto'o toppled Manchester United with his first Chelsea hat-trick, leaving manager Jose Mourinho to claim the champions cannot expect to defend the title from so far adrift.

Eto’o scored three times in 32 minutes at Stamford Bridge before Javier Hernandez pulled back a late goal for United, who finished the game with 10 men after Nemanja Vidic was dismissed late on.

David Moyes’s side are now 14 points behind leaders Arsenal, 13 behind Manchester City and 12 points off Chelsea.

Hat full: Samuel Eto'o scored a hat-trick for Chelsea to help them defeat Manchester United

‘I don’t think David will be upset if I say the reality,’ said Mourinho.

‘It is a 14-point difference, and 13 and 12. Can they recover to one of these teams? They can. But to three of them? It needs three teams to almost collapse.’

Moyes promised that United would refuse to surrender the title. He confessed he had hoped to be better placed at this stage of his debut Old Trafford season but rejected the notion of a crisis.

‘That’s your word, not mine,’ he said.

‘What we won’t do is throw in the towel until we can’t get there. The job is to try to finish first. I was hoping to win more and be competing a bit more than we’ve been but that will come.’

Moyes did not complain about Vidic’s red card, for a crude challenge on Eden Hazard, and Danny Welbeck’s claim for a penalty in the first half, after a tackle by Cesar Azpilicueta.

‘It would have been a soft one,’ said Moyes, who accepted Rafael had been fortunate to escape a red card for a reckless tackle on Gary Cahill.

‘Vidic wasn’t a sending off but I’ve seen Rafa’s and that could have been one,’ he said.

Mourinho
 celebrated becoming the fastest manager to accrue 100 Premier League 
wins — and the century came against the same team he beat for his 
first. 

The only blemish for Chelsea was a 
knee injury to Fernando Torres, who insisted on carrying on because all 
substitutes were used.

‘It
 is the lateral ligaments in his knee and it will be weeks,’ said 
Mourinho.  ‘It’s a pity for Nando but it’s time for Demba Ba. It is his 
chance.’

Moyes always knew succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson, who enjoyed 26 years of success at Old Trafford, would not be easy. But he conceded the performances of his team have not been up to scratch so far.

Damning: Jose Mourinho claimed United's defeat by Chelsea puts the Red Devils out of the title race

United looked ordinary at times on 
Sunday. Mourinho's men were more compact, they looked far more incisive 
on the attack and unlike United, their defensive stability never seemed 
in doubt.

The table does not look pretty for Moyes. United sit in seventh, just one point ahead of Newcastle.

They are six points adrift of the top four and that margin will increase by one more point if Everton beat West Brom on Monday.

One reporter put it to Moyes that his team were in crisis.

Again, the Scot disagreed: 'That's your opinion. Crisis is your word, not my word.'
