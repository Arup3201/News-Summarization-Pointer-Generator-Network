Staff at Qantas are complaining about not getting enough sleep on their trips to Los Angeles because their hotel in the city is too noisy.

Unions representing Qantas staff claim they've been inundated with complaints after flight attendants and pilots were moved to a hotel next door to the 'happiest place on earth' Disneyland and the busy convention centre.

Qantas made the move from Costa Mesa, an hour and a half south of Los Angeles Airport, to the Anaheim Hilton in the last 12 months. 

In the last 12 months Qantas staff have been staying at The Anaheim Hilton which is right next door to Disneyland and its convention centre 

Unions claim they have been inundated with complaints that staff are unable to sleep in the new accommodation Qantas is providing 

This move follows airline chief Alan Joyce's announcement  of cost cuts worth $2 billion over three years after suffering losses in recent years.

The new lodgings are about half-an-hour closer to the airport and reportedly cut accommodation costs by two-thirds, or approximately $100 per night.

Flight Attendants Association Australia National Industrial Officer Steven Reed told Newscorp that flight attendants and pilots are unable to get adequate rest because of the noise coming from the theme park and its neighbouring convention centre.

‘By the time you get to the hotel you want to go for a walk and then get some rest, not face a rock band playing in the foyer and kids running up and down the halls.'

He warned if crews aren't adequately rested they'll be required to report as ‘unfit for duty’ which could result in flight cancellations.

Although the Anaheim Hilton is about 30 minutes closer to the airport than previous accommodation, unions insist the hotel is too noisy for airline staff

A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that they observe rigid protocols in relation to the amount of rest staff must get and it is always in the best interest of the airline to ensure these requirements are met.

She said Qantas often 'go above and beyond' the regulatory rest requirements to ensure the 'wellbeing' of flight crew. 

In response to recent allegations that staff are being mistreated she said  the airline uses 'number of different hotels in LA', which are not limited to the Anaheim Hilton.

A Qantas spokeswoman said ensuring its staff's well being is of the utmost importance 

The spokeswoman said Qantas are trying to resolve the issue by collaborating with the hotel to better organise accommodation around scheduled music events that may cause concern for staff.

A spokeswoman from the Aneheim Hilton said the noise heard from the convention centre is minimal, however, if there are events held in the courtyard the noise can be louder.

She added that noise complaints are few and far between because of noise restrictions that are put into place at 10pm each night to ensure guests are not effected.

Daily Mail Australia contacted Flight Attendant Association Australia however they were unavailable for comment.

Unions are concerned that flights may be cancelled as too many staff will suffer fatigue
