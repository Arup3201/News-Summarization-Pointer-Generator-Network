Just three cups of tea a day can slash the risk of a stroke by around 20 per cent, new research shows.

Scientists found Britain’s favourite hot drink offers powerful protection against the deadly brain blood clots that kill around 200 people every day in the UK.

The findings, by researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles, back up research results published earlier this year that suggested four cups a day significantly reduced stroke risk.

Strokes cost the NHS an estimated £2.3 billion a year to just treat and look after the 100,000 people annually struck down by the life-threatening condition. Only cancer and heart disease kill more people.

Around 85 per cent of victims are affected by ischaemic strokes, where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply.

The rest are called haemorrhagic strokes, where a blood vessel bursts in the brain, causing potentially fatal bleeding.

Although many studies have highlighted the protective effects of tea on the brain, the evidence has still been inconclusive, with other research questioning whether it’s tea that really prevents strokes.

A team from UCLA trawled through dozens of previous studies to carry out what’s called a meta-analysis.

This is where researchers combine the findings of lots of little studies to come up with more powerful data.

In this case, they brought together the findings from five previous meta-analyses to see if tea really does have a significant impact on stroke risk.

The results, published online in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed those drinking the highest amount of tea a day - three cups or more - were 20 per cent less likely to fall ill than those drinking little or no tea.

Previous studies by the same UCLA team found black tea was just as effective as green tea, as antioxidants in both appear to protect against the kind of damage to arteries that can cause strokes and heart attacks.

British consumers get through an estimated 165 million cups every day of mostly black tea.

It is packed with components called flavonoids that are thought to be good for the heart and brain.In a report on their findings the researchers said: ‘The strength of this evidence supports the hypothesis that tea consumption might lower the risk of stroke.’
