League One side Doncaster have a new celebrity owner after a takeover by former chairman John Ryan and One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson was announced.

A spokesman for Ryan said that the deal had been completed and would be explained in detail at a press conference in London on Thursday.

Twenty-two-year-old Tomlinson is a global star as one member of five-piece boy band One Direction and is a lifelong fan of his hometown club.

Done deal: One Direction star Louis Tomlinson has completed his joint takeover of Doncaster Rovers

Fan: Tomlinson is a lifelong supporter of Rovers and even appeared for their reserves last season

He played for their reserve side 
against Scunthorpe earlier this year and had been close to a takeover 
before, but a move was twice delayed because of negotiations over image 
rights.

They have now been resolved and Ryan's spokesman said: 'It's done, the takeover is complete.'

Ryan, who ended his 15-year association with Rovers in November, will be the lesser known of the two men but will doubtless be the more hands-on.

The businessman has extensive football experience and oversaw Doncaster's rise from non-league to the Championship as well as their move from Belle Vue to the Keepmoat Stadium before stepping aside in November to allow Terry Bramall and Dick Watson to take over.

Return: John's spokesman has confirmed the deal, saying: 'It's done, the takeover is complete.'

The initial snag had related to 
Tomlinson's image rights, which are owned by his management team and 
would entitle them to a share of any money generated from the use of his
 image or name.

They believe
 that interest in the club will increase as a result of Tomlinson's 
ownership and it is understood they battled for a share of any extra 
revenue made through merchandise and extra ticket sales.

Tomlinson
 signed on as a player at the start of the season in a move to make 
money for the Bluebell Wood charity and turned out in front of nearly 
10,000 fans for the reserve team in February.

By
 a strange quirk, Ryan has also played for Doncaster, with the then 
52-year-old having brought himself on as a substitute in a 4-2 win 
against Hereford which came after his club had sealed promotion from the
 Conference in 2003.
