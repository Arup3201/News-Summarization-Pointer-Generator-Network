Oscar Pistorius will be allowed to compete at the  2016 Paralympic Games if he has served his sentence by the time the Games get underway. 

The South African double-amputee has been found guilty of culpable homocide after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his Pretoria home but has not yet been sentenced. 

He could face 15 years in prison but may also walk free from court when sentenced by Judge Thokozile Masipa next month.

Oscar Pistorius will be allowed to compete in the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games as long as he has completed whatever sentence he is handed by a judge for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp 

'Providing he serves his sentence and he wants to compete, and if selected by the South African National Paralympic Committee, he will be free to compete in IPC competitions going forward,' IPC spokesman Craig Spence said.

Spence said Pistorius, who has won six gold medals in three Paralympic Games, could not be denied the right to compete again as the IPC was not 'responsible for the punishment - that has come from the South African courts.'

'We are a sports organization,' Spence said. 

'We have to differentiate between sport and what's gone on in his private life.'

Event organisers described the athlete as an 'ambassador for the Paralympic movement' following his past sporting success 

The double amputee shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a door at his Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year. He maintains he thought the model was an intruder when he opened fire 

Xavier Gonzalez, chief executive of the IPC, said Friday that Pistorius' murder trial 'has not had any impact on our activities' because the organization is no longer dependent on the high profile of the South African.

'Oscar was a fundamental ambassador of the Paralympic movement in the period between 2008 and 2012,' Gonzalez said. 

'Since then, the Paralympic movement has many other ambassadors and many other athletes that have been recognized globally and we believe that will continue growing as we lead up to 2016.'
