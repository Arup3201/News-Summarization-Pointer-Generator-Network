RIGHT now, at a time where gold, silver and bronze medals dominate world news, it's easy to forget about the Medal of Honor franchise.

But Medal of Honor: Warfighter is game that is hard to ignore.

Players resume control of another Tier 1 Operator, dispatched to various scenarios across the globe.

What a view: Using the power of Frostbite 2, graphics have never looked better

There's an over-arching story line which was penned by actual Tier 1 Operators, drawing on their experiences when they were deployed overseas.

The original characters from the previous game, including Mother, Preacher and Voodoo will return, too.  

The graphics are superb, and run of an enhanced version of the Frostbite 2 engine – the powerhouse behind Battlefield 3.

They provide a grittiness that was missing in its predecessor.

On one level, for example, the player had to order in an airstrike to take down an enemy position - the destructible environments on full show.

Particle and lighting effects are top-notch, and already look far more impressive than Battlefield 3.

Everything from the sunlight piercing through clouds of ash, to the flashlights emanating from enemies' rifles, look almost photo realistic. 

Animation from non-playable characters is spot on, too. They'll scramble from cover desperately or try and flush you out with grenades.

They move like ‘real’ humans, stumbling around and crashing into things, really helping to bring the battlefield alive.

Son of a breacher man: You can choose your tactics depending on what's best

Weapons will be standard fare, including rocket launchers, various assault rifles and close-quarters weapons.

One cool gadget revealed in the demo was an unmanned robot - sent into areas decimated by air strikes to mop up any remaining baddies.

It's a nice touch, although very similar to unmanned vehicle you get to play with in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.

Another COD-inspired touch is the breach system. Here you line up outside a door and pick how to enter the room.

You may want to breach the door and go in with a shotgun. Or, toss a flash grenade in and pick off your targets with a pistol. The choice is yours.

Multiplayer has had an overhaul, too. There are 12 forces – based on Tier One Operators around the world. Each one will have its own weapons, outfits, tactics and support options.

The big new feature, though, is the Fire Team mode. Here, you can join up with a friend and take on the maps together, sharing health and ammo.

Weapons free! You'll get to use various real-world weapons, including this beast

You’ll even earn XP for watching out for you buddy, with nifty features like an ability to see your ‘friend’ through a wall ensuring the mechanic avoids becoming confusing.

If one of you is shot, the other can get him back in the game immediately by killing off the culprit.

It’s due for release on October 26.
