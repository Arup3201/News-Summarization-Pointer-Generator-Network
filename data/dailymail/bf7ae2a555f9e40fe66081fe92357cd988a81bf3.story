Authorities have fished out almost 3.6 tonnes of marijuana that was spotted floating off the coast of California.

Local border patrol agents estimate the pot haul has a street value of $3.6 million.

About 160 bales of the drug were retrieved off the coast of Dana Point, south of Los Angeles.

The gigantic haul was first reported by a boater who spied the bales bobbing about 15 miles from the shore.

Three Harbour Patrol ships were sent by the Orange County Sheriff's Department sent to aid in recovering the marijuana. A Coast Guard cutter was also dispatched.

'Shortly before noon on Sunday, May 20, maritime law enforcement authorities received a tip about suspicious bales floating in the water off the coast of Orange County, near Dana Point,' border patrol agent supervisor Michael Jimenez said in a statement.

'At other events, they've dumped the bales to get rid of weight if they're being chased,' he said.

'Generally in these cases we're aware they're being dumped. What's more unusual is that the bales were floating with no boat in sight.'

No suspects or vessel have been identified and the investigation into how the bales made it into the ocean is continuing.
