The bodies of five First World War soldiers have been found ‘frozen in time’ in a French wood almost 100 years to the day since they were killed.

All are believed to have died on September 5th 1914, the day of a ferocious fire fight between the Allies and Germans near Luneville, in eastern France.

The find is particularly poignant this week, when millions around the world will focus on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy.

The bodies of five French soldiers from the First World War have been found in a forest near Luneville almost 100 year since they were killed (pictured, French troops attack at Verdun, near to Luneville)

The French infantrymen’s skeletons lay undiscovered for all those years, along with their Lebel rifles, wallets, and a figurine of the Virgin Mary.

Philippe Sugg and Gerard Louis, two local historical researchers, made the discovery after studying First World War archives and pinpointing digging sites.

The men were in a private forest, which remained practically untouched throughout the decades since the fighting.

Mr Sugg said: ‘Documents suggest that several dozen soldiers died in the area. They were often very young men who left their families knowing there was a good chance they would never return.’

Among those ‘frozen in time’ is a 27-year-old from the southern town of Perpignan, whose name is on an identification tag.

Later this week the Queen will be in France to commemorate 70 years since the D-Day landings happened in Normandy during the Second World War

Scraps of the red trousers which the French still wore at the beginning of the war were also found.

Once his descendants have been informed, his body is likely to be exhumed and buried with full military honours, along with his comrades.

Despite the passing of the years, France and neighbouring countries are still covered with the bodies of those who died in the First and Second World War.

The Queen and other members of the Royal Family will arrive in France on Thursday to honour the sacrifice of such fallen heroes.

She will be on Sword Beach on June 6th, D-Day, at a commemorative ceremony also attended by French and American presidents Francois Hollande and Barack Obama.
