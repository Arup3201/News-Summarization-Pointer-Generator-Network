Bryan Farrow, 36, confronted his dentist Neil Chapple at his practice with a 3ft scaffolding pole and challenged him to a fight outside

A man who was unhappy with his dental treatment stormed into his dentist's surgery and threatened him with a 3ft scaffolding pole.

Bryan Farrow, 36, accused Neil Chapple of 'messing up' his teeth during a confrontation while Mr Chapple was treating another patient.

Farrow had asked the receptionist at Halstead Dental Care in Halstead, Essex, if the dentist was at work before leaving the building and returning minutes later armed with the pole.

Prosecutor Sarah Vine told Chelmsford Crown Court: 'He walked into the 
room where Mr Chapple was treating a patient and went up to Mr Chapple 
and said: "You messed up my teeth. You and me outside".

'Farrow was shaking and looked anxious and Mr Chapple said: "What have I done?".

'Farrow replied: “Come outside you smarmy ****. You ****** my teeth up".'

Farrow left the room and was heard saying to a receptionist: ‘Look at these smiley teeth’.

He said he was going to sue Mr Chapple.

Farrow then left the surgery saying ‘sorry’ and put the pole in the boot of his car.

He was arrested later by police after the incident at 2.15pm on May 20.

Farrow, of Stanway, Essex, has been jailed for 12 months after admitting threatening behaviour and possessing the pole.

He also admitted a charge of damage for picking paint off a cell wall while he was in custody.

He has also been banned from contacting Mr Chapple or attending his practice.

A judge told Farrow, who refused to have legal representation in court, that the incident had been 'shocking, unpleasant and disgraceful'.

A pre-sentencing report said that Farrow disputed witnesses' account of the confrontation and said the facts had been twisted.

Recorder John Gallagher offered him the chance to get a lawyer four times, telling him: 'I’m going to give you one final chance 
to get legal advice.

'A lawyer may be able to persuade me to reduce any 
prison sentence. Have you got anything to say?'

Farrow replied: 'Not really'.
