Manchester United players and staff paid tribute on Friday to those who died in the Munich air disaster in 1958.

Manager Louis van Gaal was at Old Trafford to lay a wreath at the Munich air disaster memorial to remember the 23 people killed in the tragic crash.

He was joined by a number of United supporters who turned up to pay their respects to the victims of the accident 57 years ago and expressed the importance of remembering the 'Busby Babes.'

He said: 'I represent the club now as its manager and I represent my players. They [the 1958 team] were a group of players who gave a lot of enjoyment to the people of that time. 

'They have played a big part in the history of the club. I have to remember that. The people were singing today and I was impressed with what they sang.' 

Van Gaal then read a small segment of a poem by Pete Martin dedicated to the victims of the crash.  

The Dutchman attended the service because he thinks it's vitally important to remember the 1958 squad

'This is what I want to read to you. I was impressed because this is the big influence they still have now. It was the last sentences...

'You are the the strengths and inspirations for those who play your roles today. We look for flair and pace and passion to play the game the United way.

'That's me and the players now they are talking about. So I was happy I was there today and maybe because of the impression that people give to me. Out of respect for the players and for Sir Matt Busby and what they left.'

The United boss read a small piece of a poem dedicated to the vicims of the tragic accident 

A minute's silence was also held at 3.04pm - the exact time of the crash. 

Legend and survivor of the crash Sir Bobby Charlton was in Germany on Friday with the Bayern Munich owner Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to pay his respects. 

The ex-England international attended a tribute exhibition at Bayern's Allianz Arena stadium. 

Sir Bobby walked away from the crash unharmed and is one of only two remaining survivors still alive.

The United legend accepted Bayern's invitation to take part in the ceremony due to his respect for the club since the disaster. 

The Manchesterplatz memorial has been heavily assisted by the Bayern staff over the years and Charlton is known to be very fond of the German club. 

Elsewhere, United stars past and present took to social media to express their feelings and pay their respects, using the hashtags #BusbyBabes #FlowersOfManchester in tribute. 

Rivals Liverpool and Manchester City also paid tributes as football united in grief.
