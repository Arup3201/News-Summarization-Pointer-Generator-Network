A 19-year-old man charged with killing his newspaper publisher father, his mother and sister has been transferred to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to serve a sentence on another charge.

Alan Hruby was moved from the Stephens County jail to the Department of Corrections’ facility in Lexington on Friday to begin a three-year sentence for fraudulently opening a credit card in the name of his grandmother.

Hruby pleaded guilty to the charge in January and was placed in a delayed sentencing program.

However that was revoked in October after Hruby was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of his father, John Hruby; his mother, Tinker Hruby; and his sister, Katherine Hruby.

John Hruby was publisher of the weekly newspaper The Marlow Review.

Earlier this month, a life insurance company had asked an Oklahoma judge to decide whether they should be forced to hand over $20,000 to the teen, who allegedly murdered his entire family in order to cash in on the policy.

The self-proclaimed shopaholic, who was drowning in debt, reportedly confessed that he had gunned down his family in October in the hope of paying off a $3,000 loan shark debt.

Hruby is facing the death penalty.

Last week, American Fidelity Assurance Co. petitioned a judge to disqualify him from receiving the policy proceeds.

The company said it can deny Hruby the money because of his alleged role in his family members' death, but needed the judge's approval.

The payout would come from two American Fidelity policies held by Hruby's rural newspaper publisher father, NewsOK reported.

His father, John Hruby, named his wife Tinker as the main beneficiary. In the event of her death, the money was to go to Alan and his sister Katherine Hruby, 17.

Authorities said Alan Hruby admitted he murdered his family to become the sole heir after he was cut off by them financially.

The insurance company asked Stephens County Associate District Judge Brent Russell to decide whether or not they must pay out the policy.

Without the petition, the company said it will be forced to make good on the payment despite Hruby's confession.

Prosecutors in Duncan, Oklahoma, filed three charges of first-degree murder against University of Oklahoma student Hruby.

Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks said Hruby owed money to a loan shark. Hicks did not say why Hruby had so much debt, only that his spending was out of control.

Alan told police that he murdered his father, John, 50 (center); mother, Tinker, 48 (right); and his 17-year-old sister Katherine (left) in October in order to claim the money from a life-insurance policy

Hruby's social media posts would routinely boast of his expensive lifestyle and he was a self-proclaimed shopaholic 

'The reason we were given for the murders was that he was having financial difficulties,' Hicks said at a news conference in Duncan. 'He felt if he murdered (his family) he would be the only heir to the estate.'

Hicks said Hruby shot his mother and father twice each and his sister once. He later left the family's house and disposed of the gun and a disc from a home security system.

 Hruby then traveled to Dallas for the weekend, where he stayed at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, Hicks said.

Hicks said Alan Hruby acted 'very nonchalant' and 'cold and callous' when he arrived at the home where the bodies of his parents were discovered by the family's housekeeper on Monday.

'I tend to think this is a very heinous and atrocious crime,' Hicks said. 'This shows the fact there was no remorse; this shows this was an evil person.

'Any tears that were shed (by Alan) were crocodile tears,' he said

John Hruby was the publisher of The Marlow Review, a weekly newspaper with a circulation of about 3,500. His wife also worked at the paper.

Hruby was also publisher of The Duncan Banner until 1997, when his family sold that paper, and was vice president of the Oklahoma Newspaper Foundation Board of Trustees, a part of the Oklahoma Press Association.
