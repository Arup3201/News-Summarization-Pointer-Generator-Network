A 15-year-old schoolboy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a young father - in a children’s playground.

Danny Parekh, 21, was found bleeding from a single stab wound to the leg shortly after 1am yesterday.

He was taken to hospital but later died. The injury was believed to have severed an artery.

Victim: Danny Parekh (21) died from a single stab wound to the leg after being attacked in a park in Nottingham in the early hours of Sunday morning

The 15-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the killing, in Nottingham, later in the day.

Witnesses heard Danny screaming in agony after he was attacked at the playground in Basford, Nottingham, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

He was rushed to the Queen’s Medical Centre in the city but died shortly after arriving.

Danny, who had a two-year-old son, was described by friends and family as 'a great, humble lad, who would do anything for anybody'.

Friend Tanny Smith, 25, said: 'He was a good guy, always up for a laugh and a joke, he would do anything for anybody. I just went to the pub with him last week. It still hasn’t sunken in. I am in shock.'

Park: Friends and family left tributes at the playground in Old Basford, Nottingham where Danny was stabbed

Tributes: Friends left flowers for Danny at the play area in Old Basford, Nottingham, where the father-of-one was fatally stabbed in the early hours of sunday morning

Another friend, Benji Nebs, 26, added: 'He was a good lad, humble, always had a smile on his face, and always had something good to say. He never had any trouble with anyone. He was polite and would always say "hello" to everybody and he was very popular.'

Dozens of people turned out at the park where he died yesterday to pay their respects and leave flowers.

One tribute read: 'Gone but never forgotten. Love, Rhea and Nikita'. Another read: 'Danny, love you so much. All love, love, Kingston and Kingsley.'

'Gone but not forgotten': Danny was taken to hospital but later died from the injury, which was believed to have severed an artery

A 27-year-old woman, who lives next to the park where Danny was found, called the ambulance after she had been woken up by 'a very high-pitched howl'.

Crime scene: one neighbour said she was terrified after the incident and wanted to move away

The mum-of-four, who did not want to be named, said the sound of the screams made her physically ill.

She said: 'It knocked me sick. When I heard the screams, I looked out of the window and saw a girl screaming hysterically.

'Then I saw she was leaning over Danny, who sat up, but slumped down, which is when I realised he was in trouble.

'I can’t believe this has happened, I will move out tomorrow. I want my children away from here.

'The kids are not stupid, they know what’s going on. My nine-year-old son was on the floor rocking - petrified.

'Danny was a brilliant lad, always showing his pure white teeth.'

A postmortem examination was carried out by a Home Office pathologist yesterday evening.

Police today were carrying out house-to-house inquiries and are making a full forensic search of the park.
