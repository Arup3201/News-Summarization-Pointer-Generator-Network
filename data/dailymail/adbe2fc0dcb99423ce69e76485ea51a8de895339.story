An anonymous passenger brightened a Philadelphia cab driver's night with the tip of a lifetime: nearly $1,000 on a $4.31 fare.

Oumar Maiga's bosses revealed the hefty, holiday-season gratuity Wednesday after waiting to make sure the credit card cleared and it wasn't an error.

The West African immigrant received the $989.98 tip December 13.

Proof: Philadelphia cabbie Oumar Maiga was given a massive tip of nearly $1,000 after giving a man a ride that took barely one minute

'I've heard of some large tips before, but nothing this big,' Everett M. Abitbol, co-founder of Freedom Taxi, told Philly.com. 'It couldn't have happened to a better guy.'

According to Abitbol, his lucky employee is a family man who pulls six or seven shifts per week to provide for his family and send a chunk back to his family in West Africa. 

Abitbol said the cabbie and passenger chatted briefly during the mile-long trip from the city's Old City section to Columbus Boulevard.

Maiga said his shift had been a little hectic. The passenger said he'd make it a great night and punched in the tip.

Maiga asked if he'd made a mistake. The passenger replied, 'I know what I did.'

Abitbol said the identity of tipper remains a mystery and will likely stay that way.

'We've tried to get in touch with him, but the credit card company won't divulge his name,' Abitbol said. 'The fare was not disputed. That's all they would say.'
