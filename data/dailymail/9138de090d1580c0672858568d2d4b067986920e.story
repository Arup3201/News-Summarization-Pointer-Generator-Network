Independent economists such as Soumaya Keynes (pictured) have urged both the Tories and Labour to be more straightforward about spending plans

Independent economists have urged both the Tories and Labour to be more straightforward with voters about their post-election tax and spending plans.

Researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that George Osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by £12billion.

They also said that Labour’s ideas to deal with Britain’s deficit were ‘less explicit’ than the other main parties, and could see Ed Miliband rack up tens of billions a year in borrowing.

Yesterday IFS director Paul Johnson criticised both the major parties over their lack of clarity ahead of May’s general election.

Referring to the Chancellor’s planned £12billion in welfare cuts, he said: ‘It is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by £12billion. It’s time we knew more about what that might actually involve.’

The Chancellor signalled yesterday that a future Conservative government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years from 2016.

The freeze, which would not include pensions, disability benefits and maternity pay, would save £3billion.

Last week the Daily Mail also revealed that other measures likely to be included in the Tory manifesto include restricting child benefit to three children for new claimants, cutting the cap on welfare claims from £26,000 to £23,000 per household and removing the right of under-25s to housing benefit and jobless payouts if they refuse offers of work, training or education.

Multi-billion pound plans to ‘revolutionise’ travel in the North of England will be unveiled today.

Part of George Osborne’s ‘Northern Powerhouse’ strategy, they include new rail routes that could see 140mph trains reduce Liverpool to Manchester journey times to around 20 minutes.

A so-called ‘TransNorth’ rail network would link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle and Hull.

The Liverpool-Manchester route could cost as much as £13billion, while a plan to reduce journey times between Sheffield and Manchester from the 48 to 27 minutes could cost up to £19billion.

Other plans include new east-west road connections and introducing Oyster-style travel cards across the North.

However even those measures would fall well short of the £12billion Mr Osborne needs to find.

Yesterday IFS economist Soumaya Keynes also warned that Labour’s rules were so loose that the party could end austerity next year and open the public spending tap again. She claimed that Labour could increase real-term spending by more than £9billion a year by 2020, compared to Tory plans to lower it by £14billion by that point.

Labour has promised that it will balance day-to-day spending at some point during the next Parliament, but has not yet specified when that will be.

And unlike the Conservatives, the party has not committed to balancing all government spending – leaving it free to borrow tens of billions for ‘investment’.

This means that under Labour, Britain’s £1.5trillion national debt could continue to grow indefinitely, while the Tories would begin to pay it off by the end of the next parliament – meeting David Cameron’s pledge to ‘fix the roof while the sun shines’.

Yesterday the Prime Minister said it was clear that Labour would borrow, spend and tax more than the Conservatives. He added: ‘I am determined not to go backwards.’

Inheritance tax takings will double in the next four years at the current threshold, as middle-income families are dragged into paying the levy.

Forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility revealed the taxman will rake in £6.4billion in 2019 – up from £3.4billion in 2013.

Once targeted at the wealthy, tens of thousands of ordinary families now pay the death tax following years of rapid house price growth.

Unchanged since 2009, it is charged at 40 per cent of the value of any estate above £325,000, or £650,000 for a couple with a joint estate.

The figures come after it emerged the Conservatives are considering raising the threshold in its election manifesto. 

George Osborne’s tax boost for orchestras fell flat yesterday when MPs claimed brass bands could be excluded.

A consultation paper published in January suggested that to qualify, ensembles would have to include string, woodwind, brass and percussion sections.

But Labour said it would leave out brass bands popular in the North of England and swiftly branded the policy a ‘trumpet tax’.

Shadow culture minister Chris Bryant said it would exclude string orchestras like the London Sinfonia and accused George Osborne of being ‘out of tune’.

The Treasury later insisted brass bands would be included, insisting the decision had been agreed weeks ago.

It said the 25 per cent tax relief from next year will apply to any group of 12 or more musicians playing instruments in any of the four orchestral sections.

Interest rates could be slashed even closer to zero to keep Britain’s economic recovery on track, a senior Bank of England official suggested yesterday.

Chief economist Andy Haldane said rates may need to be cut again – having been frozen at 0.5 per cent for more than six years – if inflation threatened to stay too low for too long after it tumbled to 0.3 per cent – its lowest level since 1960.

His intervention sent sterling tumbling on global currency markets and came days after Bank Governor Mark Carney said a cut would be ‘extremely foolish’.

Mr Haldane said: ‘The chances of a rate rise or cut are broadly evenly balanced.’
