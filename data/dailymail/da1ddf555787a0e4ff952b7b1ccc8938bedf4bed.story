A beloved dog was left blinded after burglars kicked it in the head as it tried to defend its elderly owner's home while she was at a church service.

Vicious thugs attacked the border collie Kiri, 8, as they ransacked an 86-year-old woman's home in the leafy village of Stoke Prior, West Midlands.

Neighbours in the village were so disgusted by the brutal attack that they have united to offer a £500 reward to find the burglars.

Brutal: The dog was left blinded in one eye after burglars viciously beat it when they were ransacking an old woman's home

The dog's owner, who has been widowed 
for several years, is too frightened to be identified for fear of the 
thugs returning to her home.

She said at the time: 'This has come as a real shock and I am 
gutted by what has happened to Kiri.

'She is my daily companion and all I 
am concerned about at the moment. I can’t believe anyone could be so 
heartless and cruel to an animal. It has made me very nervous about 
going out and leaving her alone.

'Kiri
appears to be fearful and is following me everywhere about the house as
if she needs constant reassurance.

'It’s terrible and I just hope 
someone can come forward with information to help the police catch the 
burglar.'

Her close friend and neighbour, Mark Jones, has been leading the community in a bid to find those responsible.

Mark, a business consultant, said: 'Kiri’s owner has been a pillar of the community for years, and we’re all shocked and saddened that this has happened to her.

'Kiri is her constant companion since her husband died, and goes everywhere with her. It’s disgusting how someone could do this to a dog and an elderly lady.

'She is very active in the community, and still sings in the church choir. It has shattered her confidence.

'Everyone in the village used to see the pair of them out walking together, but now they are both very nervous.'

Neighbours and other locals have clubbed together to put up the reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the offender.

Eight-year-old Kiri now follows its owner around the house as it is scared after the attack

A grey purse containing cash was stolen when the house was broken into between 5.15pm and 7.15pm on the 2 September while the owner was out.

Detective Sergeant Ed Slough, from Bromsgrove CID said: 'The dog was attacked viciously and villagers have been so incensed and shocked by this incident that they have got together to put up a reward to help catch whoever did it.

'We really need people to come forward if they remember anything at all that could help our investigation or give us a name if they know or think they know who was responsible.'
