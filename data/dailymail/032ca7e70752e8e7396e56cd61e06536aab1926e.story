Lewis Hamilton has ended a four-year relationship with management company XIX Entertainment.

Hamilton signed for Simon Fuller's group at the start of 2011 after almost a year of looking after his own affairs following a difficult split with father Anthony early in 2010.

The 29-year-old, currently leading the Formula One world championship by 17 points to Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, is now in search of new management.

Asked about the parting of the ways with Fuller, who also handles David Beckham and Sir Bradley Wiggins, along with an array of stars, Hamilton said: "There is not really much to say.

"The contract expired and I am going to be doing something different.

"I don't know what yet, but I will decide at the end of the year."

Fuller played a key role in Hamilton's contract negotiations when he left McLaren for Mercedes towards the end of 2012.

Hamilton's three-year deal with Mercedes expires at the end of next year, although there have been indications from motorsport boss Toto Wolff of a desire to retain the Briton.

Tentative talks have already started, but been placed on hold whilst Hamilton fights for the world title.

It could be either Hamilton will handle any future negotiations himself, or have a new manager in place to take on the situation.
