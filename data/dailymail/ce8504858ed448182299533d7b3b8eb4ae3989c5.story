Duty: Angela Merkel said Germany must never forget the atrocities committed by the Nazis

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country can never forget the Nazi Holocaust and says her nation has ‘an everlasting responsibility’ for Nazi crimes.

Mrs Merkel, who will fight for re-election for a third time this coming autumn, spoke at the weekend ahead of national commemorations this week remembering the Nazi takeover of Germany on January 30 1933. It marked the start of 12 long years of terror, a world war and the extermination of six million Jews.

‘Naturally, we have an everlasting responsibility for the crimes of national-socialism, for the victims of World War II, and above all, for the Holocaust,’ Mrs Merkel said in a podcast on her website.

Hours later there were church services held across Germany on Sunday for Holocaust Memorial Day: on January 27 1945 the Red Army liberated the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz in occupied Poland.

Mrs Merkel went on: ‘We must clearly say, generation after generation, and say it again: with courage, civil courage, each individual can help ensure that racism and anti-Semitism have no chance.

‘We’re facing our history, we’re not hiding anything, we’re not repressing anything. We must confront this to make sure we are a good and trustworthy partner in the future, as we already are today, thankfully,’ she said.

Multiple events, exhibitions and concerts planned to remember Nazi era for the rest of this year under the title ‘Destroyed Diversity,’ which begin on January 30 in Berlin.

In Berlin posters are being put up across the city on special podiums promoting Germans who exemplified diversity.

They range from Jewish Nobel physicist 
Albert Einstein, who managed to escape from Germany, to Jewish poet 
Gertrud Kolmar who did not. She was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943. In 
all some 200 people are being honoured at sites across the metropolis.

Individual tours are planned to remember resisters like Otto and Elise Hampel, caught and beheaded in 1943, for distributing anonymous postcards around the city decrying the regime after she lost her brother in the campaign against France in 1940.

Their fate inspired the author Hans Fallada to write a novel based on their silent herorism called ‘Alone in Berlin’ which became a global bestseller three years ago.

At the scene of the city’s former Gestapo HQ, where the torture cellars now form part of the tour for visitors, an exhibition called ‘Berlin 1933 - The Route to Dictatorship’ opens up on January 31 chronicling the first six months of the regime and the building of its apparatus of repression.

On April 4 off the swanky Kurfuerstendamm shopping street in west Berlin an exhibition entitled ‘Career or Civil Courage; Women Under National Socialism’ will open detailing the lot of womenhood under Hitler.

On November 9 remembrance of Nazi rule will encompass more special commemorations as it marks the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass, when the regime underwrote a nationwide pogrom against the Jews.

Synagogues were burned, hundreds killed or arrested and the broken glass of Jewish businesses littered the streets of German cities and towns; the precursor of the Holocaust that was soon to follow.

Major cities like Munich, Duesseldorf, Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart have their own programmes to remember the blackest day in German history, but Berlin is the centrepoint of all such commemorations, just as it was the centre of power for Hitler and his gang all those years ago.
