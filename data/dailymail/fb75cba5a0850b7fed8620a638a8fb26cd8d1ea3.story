The Royal Mail is to issue a series of special stamps over the next five years to commemorate the First World War.

The set will feature 30 stamps covering a number of themes associated with the Great War, from haunting images of no man's land to famous war poetry.

An initial set is going on sale this week available at 10,000 post offices across the country as part of moves to mark 100 year anniversary of the beginning of the conflict.

The first batch includes a painting of a poppy (pictured left) by Fiona Strickland, the Scottish born and Edinburgh based artist and a picture of a memorial in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne called 'The Response' (pictured right)

Over the next five years, the collection will feature a wide-range of themes linked to the war including the contribution of the armed services, the role of the Commonwealth Countries and non-combatants and women.

The first batch includes a painting of a poppy by Fiona Strickland, the Scottish born and Edinburgh based leading botanical artist.

Another design includes lines from Laurence Binyon’s iconic war poem ‘For the Fallen’, which is often recited at Remembrance services in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

A painting called 'A Star Shell' by CRW Nevinson features on another stamp. The war art shows a flare illuminating no man’s land.

One stamp includes a portrait of child soldier Private William Tickle who enlisted in September 1914, and served in the 9th Battalion, Essex Regiment.

He was accepted despite being under age and served until he was killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

Another features a picture of ‘The Response’, a bronze memorial by Welsh artist Sir William Goscombe John representing the raising of several companies of the Northumberland Fusiliers.

The memorial depicts the men joining up in 1914 and is located in a public park in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.

A stamp with a picture of the Princess Mary Gift Box completes the first set. The embossed brass boxes were given as Christmas presents to everyone wearing the King’s uniform and serving overseas on December 25 1914.

The scheme was launched by Princess Mary, the 17-year-old daughter of King George V. The box included a Christmas card and a picture of the Princess along with gifts.

Servicemen at the front or at sea who were smokers received a pipe, an ounce of tobacco, cigarettes and a tinder lighter. Non-smokers received a packet of sweets and a writing case with pencil, paper and envelopes.

The Royal Mail's Managing director for consumer and network access, Stephen Agar, said: ‘The Great War changed the course of world history in ways which are still being felt today. This is why we took the decision to produce 30 stamps over a five-year period. 

Helen Grant, minister for the First World War Centenary added: ‘Postal workers played a really important role in the war, with many displaying gallantry and heroism of the highest order. I hope that these stamps will help to bring home the meaning of the centenary to everyone that sees them.’
