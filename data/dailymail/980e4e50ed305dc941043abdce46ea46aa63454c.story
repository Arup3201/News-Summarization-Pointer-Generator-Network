Two giant supermarkets have opened today in a dusty tent city in Jordan built for refugees who have fled wartorn Syria.

The shops are the first to spring up in the Zaatari desert refuge camp and have been welcomed by the United Nations World Food Programme as a way of distributing rations.

It will allow camp residents to shop for a
 large variety of goods and bring a sense of normal life to some 100,000
 Syrian refugees based there.

The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed the opening of two hypermarkets inside the Zaatari camp which will allow camp residents to shop for a large variety of goods

With vouchers, refugees can choose from a diverse list of food that are not normally included in conventional food rations.

A voucher has a value of JD18 (U.S.$ 25) per person per month and is 
complemented by a monthly ration of rice, lentils, bulgur wheat, date 
bars, sugar and salt.

Over 
the coming weeks, the WFP will gradually reduce the food commodities and 
increase the value of the voucher until the camp is assisted entirely 
through food vouchers at a value of JD24 (U.S.$ 34) per person per 
month.

The Zaatari camp, 
about eight miles from the Syrian border, is the world's second-largest 
refugee camp - behind Dadaab in eastern Kenya - and has become the 
fourth largest city in Jordan.

It opened in July 2012 with some 100 refugee families, the original camp was built in nine days.

The camp now welcomes 2,000 new residents each day and is made up of 30,000 shelters and administration buildings.

It costs about $500,000 a day to run, with half a million pieces of bread and 4.2 million litres of water distributed daily.
