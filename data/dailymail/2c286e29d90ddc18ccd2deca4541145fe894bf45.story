It has been scientifically proven that receiving and giving hugs releases the body's natural 'love drug, oxytocin, calming your nervous system and boosting positive emotions.

Now, a Japanese company has invented a chair that can provide those warm feelings on demand, an invention, they say, which is particularly useful for the elderly and those who live alone.  

The 'tranquility chair' is essentially a fabric doll built into a rocking chair.

The female doll is a larger-than-life blonde figure dressed in an apron and a delightful hat, with extra long arms.  

'They are comforting for people who live alone - they can talk to them and hug them. They also play old Japanese music, which is nostalgic for older people' said a spokesman for manufacturer UniCare.

Another popular invention is the UniCare 'Life Rhythm Doll' – a robot which is programmed to assist the elderly in a number of ways, including by reminding them to take their medicine or when to go to the bathroom.

Paro have been making a splash in rehabilitation treatment since 2004.

'Real animals can scratch and poo, but this one won't,' said a spokesperson for Paro.
