A Washington man who pleaded guilty last year 
to butchering his three-year-old son to death because his wife was threatening to leave him will spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, was sentenced Friday in district court in Dillon, Montana, to life for the grisly killing and dismembering of his young son Broderick Cramer last summer only two days before the boy's fourth birthday.

On July 8, Cramer took Broderick to a remote field outside Anconda, Montana, and killed him following an argument with his wife, Nataliya.

On Friday, District Judge Loren Tucker removed any option of parole, saying the brutality of the crime deserved the harshest punishment possible.

Jeremy Cramer, 38, sat slumped in a Montana courtroom on Friday after a judge sentenced him to life in prison without parole for the heinous murder of his three-year-old son

'We're dealing with ... the gruesome, horrible, dismembered butchery of a child. Your child. It's almost impossible to fathom the gravity of that crime,' said the judge.

Officials said Cramer's son died after being struck in the head with a rock, but that was only the beginning of the man's rampage.

He then took a large knife and cut the boy's throat so badly he nearly severed his head clean off his shoulders, a parole officer described to the horrified court room.

Investigators found the boy's heart nearby, his organs had been removed, lead investigator John Sullivan told jurors. The child's body was cut in two, with both halves found near to each other, he added.

Cramer then made is way to a gas station to wash his own son's blood off his clothes, witnesses told police. The boy's remains were found the next day.

He was also found with an empty bottle of Adderall, police said, likely a result of his on/off struggles with stimulants since he was a teenager.

Butchered: Broderick Cramer was gutted and cut in half by his own father

Cramer had argued with his wife that morning, and she had told him that he would lose his family if he didn’t get his act together, Assistant Attorney General Brant Light said.

'I love my son and my wife with all my heart, and this is something I have to live with,' Cramer told the court said.

Cramer was $30,000 in debt, couldn’t hold steady work and was using — and likely abusing — prescription drugs, Light said.

He and his his wife had a similar argument a week prior, and Cramer told her then that she may leave, but she wouldn’t take their son, Light said.

That morning, after the confrontation, Cramer snatched the boy, took his wife’s cellphone and drove away from their Lacey home.

Nataliya Cramer dug up an old cellphone and called police that afternoon after her husband would not respond to calls or text messages.

His former wife was not present in court, but a statement from her read aloud called him an 'animal' and questioned how she lived with him for five years.

'Why did he do this? Why did he hurt a boy who loved him with all his heart? her statement asked.

'I know for sure this was planned ahead of time,' she wrote, adding that he had threatened to take the boy when they divorced.

Addict: Cramer, pictured in court last year, was deeply in debt, a former meth addict and had threatened his wife that he would take away her son in a divorce

He admitted killing his son late last year.

Cramer
 told Judge Loren Tucker back in December that he decided to change his plea from not guilty 
because a prison sentence doesn't much matter with his son dead.

'I purposely killed my son,' he told the court.

'After a few months of thinking about it, I'm taking accountability for it,' Cramer told District Judge Loren Tucker of Dillon.

'Whether it's eight years or 80 years, my son's not here. I just want to get this over.'

Cramer
 was arrested July 8 after an Anaconda convenience store employee found 
him washing blood from his clothes in the business's restroom.

Cramer's
 wife, Nataliya, told Lacey police then that her husband had taken their son 
and had not answered phone calls or text messages.

He was arrested when he refused to put his clothes back on.

Police found bloody keys and a knife on Cramer when he was arrested.

Cramer's wife confirmed her husband's identity and asked police to 'find my son.'

Cramer refused to provide information 
about his son or the location of his truck. Cramer, a Mormon, asked to 
speak to somebody high in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, saying 'the adversary,' or devil, 'is out.'

The church president for southwestern Montana spoke with Cramer for an hour, but Cramer did not reveal the boy's location.

At 5:27 a.m. the morning after the 
arrest, Cramer called his father from the jailhouse near a sign that 
says all calls are recorded. He also asked an officer whether phone 
calls are recorded, the documents said.

Cramer told his father that he started walking down the road, with Brody on his shoulders, after running out of gas.

Where it happened: Police found the boy's butchered body in this field

The
 boy became 'like some other kid when he was on my neck,' then he 
remembered looking at his son's face and 'I just died right there,' 
Cramer said, according to the transcript.

'The
 thing was, it wasn't like I had a few beers or it was like something 
was up inside. Why did I take all my pills? Did I take all my pills?'

His father suggested over and over that Brody may still be alive. 'Dad, Brody's dead,' Cramer said.'Are you sure?' his father responded.

'My son is dead, 100 percent, my son is dead, yes I did it, something did it of me but I didn't do it,' Cramer answered.

'He could be laying in a field still alive,' his father said a moment later.

'Dad,
 he's dead, dead, dead, dead because I know he is. I just know it. I see
 a vivid picture of him looking at him before ahhh. He's dead, OK,' 
Cramer said.

Cramer told 
investigators that morning as they were trying to read him his rights, 
'You gotta understand something. I killed my best friend.'

The killer's brother,
 Jon Cramer, told police his brother was a former methamphetamine addict
 who had been 'doctor shopping' for a physician who would provide him 
with Adderall.
