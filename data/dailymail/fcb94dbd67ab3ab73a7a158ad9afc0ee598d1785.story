Commonwealth bronze medallist Lomalito Moala has said he will pull out of the Glasgow Games if Tongan officials discipline him for wearing a Celtic shirt during the opening ceremony.Â 

Moala, who won bronze in the lightweight 60kg boxing at Delhi 2010, is a huge Bhoys fan, and on Tuesday watched their Champions League qualifying win against KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield.

As the Tongan competitiors made their way out on to the stage at Celtic Park on Wednesday evening, the 22-year-old boxer held out a Celtic shirt, before putting it on, much to the delight of the 40,000 fans inside the Glasgow side's stadium.
