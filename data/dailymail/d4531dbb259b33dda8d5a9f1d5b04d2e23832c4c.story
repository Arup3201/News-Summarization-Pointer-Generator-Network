American Express are trying to retrieve more than $40,000 worth of debt racked up on the credit card of the late radio host Casey Kasem.

The broadcast legend died in June at the age of 82 following a long battle with Parkinson's disease.

However, according to TMZ, the bank have filed a creditors claim in a bid to get the money back and settle the outstanding fee. 

The site reported that Kasem would not have been able to use his card a year before his death.

Mail Online have reached out to American Express for comment. 

According to the Guidance for Managing Deceased Accounts on their website, customers have to inform the bank of a loved one's death and are still liable for the funds.

Even though he died six months ago, Kasem's body is still being kept above ground in Norway as his family await a proper burial. 

His children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem announced their father's death on social media in June. 

The message did not include the name of his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly court battle over his medical treatment.

Kasem was known worldwide as the longtime host of radio program 'American Top 40' and as the voice of cartoon character Shaggy from the Scooby-Doo franchise.

In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. 

The family of the late disc jockey, who was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon series Scooby-Doo, is currently in a legal battle with his widow Jean (pictured) to have his body brought back from Norway 

Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia. 

Earlier this month the site claimed that the late radio icon’s daughter Kerri Kasem has filed documents pleading with a judge to order that Jean, his widow, bring his body back to the US, where they intend to bury him as he wished.

The website reports that Casey’s children fear that if the remains are not returned to America soon, they will have decomposed too much. 

Kerri’s latest attempt to prevent her stepmother from burying Casey in Scandinavia against his wishes comes after she wrote a scathing open letter about Jean to Norwegian government officials.

Kerri wrote: ‘As beautiful as your country is, our father has never spoken of any desire to be buried in Norway either to us or to his friends. In fact, it was the opposite. ‘Casey wanted to be buried in his hometown of Los Angeles, California, his home of over 53 years.

‘Do not be fooled into believing his wife, Jean Kasem, who abandoned and isolated him during the last year of his life.’
