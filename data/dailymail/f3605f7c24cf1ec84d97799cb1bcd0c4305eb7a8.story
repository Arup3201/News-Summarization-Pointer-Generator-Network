More than a quarter of gay people have been subjected to violence, abuse or hate-filled threats in the past five years, according to 'the most comprehensive study' of homophobia in Europe.

The European Union are calling for action to counter discrimination and violence against homosexuals after the survey, by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, revealed many gay people are living in fear across the 27-nation bloc.

Morten Kjaerum, of the EUAFR, said action is needed 'to break down the barriers, eliminate the hate and create a society where everyone can fully enjoy their rights.'

The survey of 93,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people showed that more than 80 percent of the group are verbally abused or bullied at school, nearly one in five feel discriminated against when seeking work and a quarter of the people have been attacked or threatened in recent years.

Loud and proud: The survey also found that poorer and younger respondents were more likely to face discrimination due to their sexuality while the majority of attacks took place in public and were usually carried out by men in groups of more than one

The survey was released Friday at a conference in The Hague, Netherlands, on the International Day against Homophobia.

It also found that poorer and younger respondents were more likely to face discrimination due to their sexuality while the majority of attacks took place in public and were usually carried out by men in groups of more than one.

More worryingly, it revealed that more than half of gay people who have suffered violence on account of their sexuality did not report it to police.

Meanwhile, two-thirds of respondents said they had tried to hide or disguise their sexuality at school and 20 per cent of gay or bisexual respondents [and 29 per cent of transgender 
respondents] said they had suffered discrimination at work or when 
looking for a job.

Gay man John van Breugel, from the Netherlands, told the BBC he had been attacked only twice in his life, adding: 'First when I was in Germany with my boyfriend and a couple came up and called us "dirty gays."

He said the second time was in London when a man spat in his face as he went to the shops.

He added: 'I came out as gay when I was 17,' he recalled. 'My best friend never
spoke to me again, but everyone else was very accepting - my family and
friends were great. At my high school no bad words were said against 
me.'
