Two rally drivers made a lucky escape when the car they were in toppled over the edge of a hill, rolling six times as it careered through a vineyard.

Belgian pair Thierry Neuville and co-driver Nicolas Gilsoul survived unscathed after a dramatic crash during the shakedown stage of Rally Germany, near Konz in the south-west of the country.

Shocking on board footage shows the pair driving through a left hand bend when they lose control of the car, causing the Hyundai i20 rally car to leave the road.

The car starts to tip before rolling six times down a hill into a vineyard.

Both drivers quickly escaped from the wreckage after it came to a rest.

Neither were hurt in the crash, Hyundai Motorsport said.
