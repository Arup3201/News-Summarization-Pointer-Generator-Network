A man from Melbourne was discovered dead face down on a bed in a hotel room in Bali on Australia Day.

The man from Brighton, in Melbourne's exclusive southeast suburbs, checked into room 570 at the Fave hotel in the tourist district in Seminyak on January 16 and was supposed to check out on Monday but never surfaced.

Hotel staff were calling the room from midday and eventually gained access with a master key later that night when they made the grisly discovery of the man lying face first with dry blood around his mouth.

The man was last seen by staff 48 hours earlier in an intoxicated state when he was being helped to his room by a fellow hotel guest.

Medicines and vitamins, including anti-acid and stamina enhancer supplements, as well as an empty bottle of vodka, were also found in the room leading police to believe that the 41-year-old man may have been unwell.

The man's phone, laptop, wallet and money were also found in the room.

Sanglah morgue's head of forensics, Dr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, said although the cause of death would not be determined until an autopsy was conducted - there were signs of suffocation due to a lack of oxygen.

'From an external examination we allege that he died around 12 to 24 hours before the examination,' he told News Corp. 

Kuta police investigator, Dewa Tagel said there was no sign of violence on the body or the hotel room.

'There is no sign of a fight in the room, as all the stuff was still neatly arranged in the room,' he told News Corp.

He said the man's wallet and passport were found in the safety deposit box and the equivalent in local currency of about $160AUD was still on the table.

'We are yet to check the CCTV to confirm no one else entered his room. But judging from the hotel room nothing was disturbed,' Mr Tagel told Fairfax. 

'There was no sign of anyone else in the room.'
