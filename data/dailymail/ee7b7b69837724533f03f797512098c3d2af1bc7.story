The devastated father of the 23-year-old student who died after being brutally gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi has described her as 'the hero' of her family.

In a country where women are routinely pushed into lives of subservience, the bright physiotherapy student - affectionately called 'bitiya', or 'little daughter' by her parents - was going to lift her family out of poverty, he said.

'Without her we are lost,' said her grief-stricken father, who spoke out after the trial of five of the alleged attackers got underway at a fast-track court in India, adding: 'I want them to hang'.

The girl was savagely attacked when boarded a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema on December 16. According to police documents the bus was under the control of six men out for a joyride.

In an hour-long ordeal, the girl was repeatedly raped and brutalised, and her male friend was beaten, until they were eventually dumped, naked and bleeding, onto the side of the road. She was flown to hospital in Singapore for treatment, but slipped into a coma and died on December 29.

Her mother, who told her cherished daughter that if she studied hard she could escape a life of poverty, said her 'dream has ended' with her child's death.

Because of a legal gag order, the victim and her family cannot be identified until the end of the trial of the alleged rapists.

While the family was poor, 'life was 
good', the girl's father said, adding: 'She was the hero of the film in 
our family. Always happy. Always laughing.'

While
Indian culture has a deeply rooted preference for sons, and many girls 
are expected to spend their lives caring for first their brothers and 
later their husbands, the 23-year-old's parents had encouraged their 
hard-working daughter's dreams of becoming a doctor.

'I
never discriminated between my sons 
and daughter. I could see nothing else in this world but my children. 
They had to study at any cost,' her father said, who supported his 
daughter when she said she wanted to study physiotherapy in a hill town 
far from her New Delhi home - a longer but more affordable route to a future career in medicine.

As
money was scarce, he asked his older son, who is in his late teens, to 
delay enrolment at an engineering college until his sister finished her 
studies.

'My own father
could not educate me very much. He had no means. I wanted different 
things for my children,' said the victim's father, who is in his 
mid-fifties, and works 16 hour days as a baggage handler at New Delhi airport to support his family.

In his absence, his daughter kept an eye on her siblings, he said, adding: 'She was the head of the family in 
the real sense.

'Now that she is gone I can't even see 
tomorrow clearly. I have no idea about the future.'

She worked 
night shifts at a call centre to help cover her rent and fees at a college in the Himalayan foothills. 
Most days she slept for just a few hours in her rented room, and her 
parents would call her every morning to ensure she got up for class.

Anger: Protestors tried to break through a police cordon at a demonstration in New Delhi following the savage assault, which has galvanised public anger in India over sex attacks

By December she was back in New Delhi, living at home and awaiting the results of her final exams.

But on December 16, after getting on a
bus home after seeing a movie at a film with a male friend, she fell 
victim to a devastating attack.

According to police documents the bus
was being driven by six men out for a joyride. For almost an hour the 
student and her friend were driven through the city. He was beaten. She 
was gang-raped, and penetrated with metal rods, causing such severe 
internal injuries that doctors found parts of her intestines floating 
inside her abdomen.

Eventually, the two were dumped, naked and bleeding, by a busy road on the cold December night.

'Imagine how much she must have 
suffered,' her brother said. 'We would fight, you know. Brothers and 
sisters fight too. And if I pushed her too hard she felt pain.'

'For almost 10 days her brain was alert," said her mother, a slim woman wrapped in a sari, her eyes red from weeks of weeping.

Police and a magistrate took 
statements from her in a New Delhi hospital. She remembered the names of
her attackers. She recognized the faces in the photographs police 
showed her.

She broke down only once. 'She told me "Mummy, they beat me a lot".

'That was the only time she showed her pain,' the mother said.Â 

'Without her we are lost': In a country where girls are routinely pushed into lives of subservience, the student's parents had encouraged their bright, hard-working daughter to shine

When infection began to ravage her body, she was flown with her family to a Singapore hospital. But she slipped into a coma at Christmas and died on December 29.

Now, her relatives feel varying degrees of rage and helplessness.

'Sometimes I want to kill them myself,' her brother said. 'But I know that would be wrong.'

If convicted, five of the attackers could face death sentences. A sixth, declared a juvenile, would likely serve three years in reform home if convicted.

'I want them to hang. They should not come out alive after what they did to my child,' said the father.

'This is not just about my daughter. If there is no justice in this case it will hurt the progress of girls in the whole country. Every parent will be afraid for their daughters.'

The girl's mother said: 'I always told my children, if you study hard you can escape this poverty. All my life I believed that.

'Now that dream has ended. My faith has left me.'

Three weeks after the 23-year-old died, her parents learned that she had passed her final exams.
