Andrew Rosenfeld founded a company that gives free mobile calls and text messages to Unite members

A firm set up by one of Labour’s biggest donors has been helping union thugs who are running a campaign of intimidation.

The People’s Operator, a mobile phone company founded by multi-millionaire Andrew Rosenfeld – a close friend of Ed Miliband – gives free mobile calls and text messages to Unite members.

It signed a deal last year to supply phones to activists and funnel cash to the union.

A document drawn up by Unite reveals that strike committees get free calls and text messages to coordinate mob action.

The Mail revealed yesterday how Unite was carrying out a campaign of bullying and intimidation against senior managers during the bitter dispute over Grangemouth oil refinery.

The union’s so-called ‘leverage’ teams sent dozens of thugs to invade the driveway of a boss at the refinery in Scotland during a dispute this month – leaving his wife and children fearing for their safety.

David Cameron said the Mail’s revelations were ‘shocking’ and called on Mr Miliband to reopen a Labour investigation of Unite activities.

The Prime Minister said: ‘People have a right to protest. But no one has a right to intimidate, nobody has a right to bully.

Unite leaders deployed a dirty tricks squad to target and humiliate executives of the Ineos chemical company and their families

‘Nobody has a right to threaten people’s families, no one has a right to threaten people in their homes. It is very serious.

‘The Labour Party does need to investigate what has been happening with the Unite union. Action needs to be taken.’

Andrew Rosenfeld, 51, is one of Labour’s biggest individual donors, having recently returned from tax exile in Switzerland.

He made around £100million from his property company Minerva, before he sold up and moved for ‘lifestyle reasons’ in 2006.

Mr Rosenfeld also sold his £5.5million London house to a trust in Liechtenstein. He then bought a £9million mansion in the Vandoeuvres area of Geneva.

While Ed Miliband claims to speak for cash-strapped voters, Mr Rosenfeld has been conspicuous by his consumption.

He once bought an £8.5million house in cash. It was also reported he made £30million selling his Geneva mansion to the daughter of Uzbekistan dictator Islam Karimov, a man accused of boiling his enemies to death.

When he returned to Britain in 2011 Mr Rosenfeld was brought into Mr Miliband’s inner circle at the top of the Labour Party.Shortly after a series of large donations he was given a formal role involving external relations, fundraising, supporter and trade union engagement.

Mr Rosenfeld has given or pledged Labour around £2million in donations and loans since 2005. He first loaned £1million to the party to fund their 2005 election campaign, money that was reportedly repaid in 2009.

But that loan led to him becoming linked to the Cash for Honours scandal when it emerged his name was on a list of businessmen earmarked for a peerage.

Since Mr Miliband became leader, Mr Rosenfeld has donated £663,494.30 to Labour. He has also promised to donate a total of £1million before the next election.

Despite his close friendship with Ed Miliband, Mr Rosenfeld hasn’t always backed Labour. In 2001 he donated £10,000 to Ken Clarke’s bid to become Tory leader.

And he once lavished praise on David Cameron’s campaign to become Prime Minister, saying he was the ‘man for the job’.Mr Rosenfeld said: ‘We are tired of the whole Labour message. Only Mr Cameron has the real capability of governing.’

In April this year the Mail reported the property developer had separated from his wife Nicola and was living with Juliet Soskice, a former girlfriend of Mr Miliband. He set up home with the brunette psychotherapist on the fringes of Regent’s Park.

The revelation that one of Labour’s 
biggest solo donors has been helping Unite came in a 50-page guide 
published by the union for its activists.

It details how they should 
identify ‘the potential vulnerabilities of the employer’ so they can hit
them with leverage action.

The document states: ‘Leverage treats the employer as an opponent’ and advises ‘escalation is critical’.

It also reveals how Unite has used its 
relationship with The People’s Operator to facilitate industrial action,
stating: ‘TPO (The People’s Operator) is a Unite-backed mobile phone 
operator providing cheap phone services to members and free TPO to TPO 
calls and text messaging.

'TPO sim cards should be provided to all 
contacts to enable free text messaging and calls between strike 
committee members and activists.’

Unite officials say the sim cards are paid for by strike committees themselves – but when they go on strike they can get funds to pay for them from the union.

The People’s Operator was set up last year and boasts that it helps its partners send money to ‘charities’ and other good causes.

Under the deal with Unite, the union is paid 10 per cent of the call, text or data spend of any members they sign up to the service.

Mr Rosenfeld, a former tax exile, has given Labour more than £663,000 since Mr Miliband became leader.

He has promised to give another £1million more in the run up to the next general election.

The Mail revealed yesterday how Unite leaders deployed a dirty tricks squad to target and humiliate executives of the Ineos chemical company and their families.

The leverage team sent mobs of protesters to the homes of senior figures in the firm, which owns the Grangemouth refinery.

The daughter of one company boss had ‘Wanted’ posters denouncing her father posted through her front door hundreds of miles away.

In a letter to Mr Miliband yesterday, Tory Chairman Grant Shapps called on the Labour leader to condemn Unite’s activities, asking: ‘Will you now refuse to accept any more money from Unite until those responsible for threatening innocent families are disciplined?’

Mr Miliband’s aides at first condemned the Tories for being ‘irresponsible by inflaming a difficult situation’.

But on viewing TV news coverage of the Mail story, Mr Miliband said: ‘I condemn intimidatory tactics. It is not how industrial disputes should be conducted. This is true for unions just as it is true for employers.’

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey refused to back down last night, making clear he would continue to advocate bully-boy tactics.

He told Channel 4 News: ‘It’s a small part of our leverage. We reserve the right to do anything within the law.’

A Unite spokesman said: ‘We work with TPO to provide our members the best mobile service at the lowest cost.

‘Trying to find something sinister in this is simply desperate.’

The Mail contacted the head office of The People’s Operator and asked for a response from Andrew Rosenfeld or the company but was told no one was available for comment.
