Rubbish record: Under Pickles' watch, many places in the U.K have lost weekly bin collections, something he once called a 'fundamental right'

More than five million families have lost weekly bin collections since the Government came to power, the Daily Mail has discovered.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles declared two years ago that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘fundamental right’ – but cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch, with 60 councils introducing a fortnightly waste collection since May 2010.

Eleven authorities, including both Tory and Labour councils, have dumped weekly collections in the past year alone, with two more planning to follow suit soon.

By the time of the election next year, 18.5million families will have lost weekly bin rounds.

Council leaders last night said that Mr Pickles’ efforts to reverse the trend – including a £250million fund to persuade councils to keep weekly bin rounds – had been a ‘sham and PR stunt’.

Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory.

But now councils are coming up with even more extreme measures in a bid to reduce collection costs.

Next month, Falkirk Council will cut collections to once every three weeks, and Swansea Council is to fine residents who put out more than three bin bags a fortnight.

Mr Pickles admitted last week he was powerless to stop the erosion of waste services – a dramatic concession after years of claims he could reverse the trend.

Back in 2012, he announced a £250million fund that was meant to herald the return of weekly collections.

Some of the collection services have been reduced to even fewer than once a fortnight. These residents in Wallisdown, Poole, have to wait three weeks for their rubbish to be collected

While some councils used it to keep weekly collections, none have brought back weekly bin rounds and many have instead used the fund to increase recycling schemes.

Labour-run Sheffield Council was given £500,000 to protect weekly collections for 30,000 flats in high-rise blocks.

But it said had it been given more it would have been able to keep weekly rounds at 210,000 homes which have since been scrapped.

Councillor Jack Scott, the council’s environment boss, said: ‘It was obvious from the start that this £250million fund was nothing more than a sham and a PR stunt.

‘We wrote to Eric Pickles several times making it clear that we wanted to keep weekly collections if he would give us the money.

He refused.

The truth is, more councils have been forced to move to alternate week collections since this Government came to power due to the unprecedented level of cuts.’

Hilary Benn, Labour’s communities spokesman, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that Eric Pickles wasted £250million on his bin scheme, which shows that while he talks a lot he can’t deliver.’

Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said the Coalition had safeguarded weekly bin collections for six million homes

But Mr Pickles said last week  that his actions had stopped the movement towards universal fortnightly collections.

He told the BBC: ‘It is a matter for local authorities, but what I have done is remove the inevitability of fortnightly collections. We have made a big difference.’

Mr Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, which only has authority over councils in England, claims that it has slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections.

Before the Coalition came into power in 2010 councils were actively encouraged to move towards less frequent bin rounds.

The Welsh Government, which is Labour-led, still has a policy of adopting fortnightly rounds.

Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said: 'Our weekly collections support scheme has safeguarded the weekly service of six million homes and axed the Labour Government’s policy of forcing fortnightly collections for all.

'We have scrapped Labour’s plans for new bin taxes, are reining in unfair bin fines and axed bin snoopers’ powers of entry into your home.

'Yes, there is more to do – but contrast our record with the Labour-led Welsh Government, which has killed off weekly collections and now wants monthly bin collections.

'It is a myth that fortnightly collections are needed to save money or increase recycling, peddled by town hall bureaucrats and bin barons who don’t care about frontline services.'
