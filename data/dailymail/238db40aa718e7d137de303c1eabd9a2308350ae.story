The No Make Up Selfies which have taken the internet by storm over the last two days are thought to have raised a staggering £1 million for charity.

And now the Fellas of Facebook and Twitter have decided they too want to get their mugs in on the action and a flurry of selfies featuring men in make-up have started appearing online.

Sean Lawson Bisset from Dunbar, East Lothian glammed up in support of the ladies who have been stripping their make-up back for charity

Stuart Laurie puckers up in Lippy and eye make-up and Raymond Galea also flutters a girly eyelash

Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her 
12-year-old brother  Zach, while 
Martin Helliwell, 29, from Lancashire, piled on the slap to raise 
awareness.

Some of the fellas seem to have gone girly and cute, while others were maybe inspired by Halloween outfits when they got out the slap, but their efforts were all commendable.

Meanwhile the #NoMakeUpSelfie shows no signs of dieing down just yet as women continue to strip back their look in the name of charity.

Kath Abrahams, Director of Engagement and Income generation at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 

John-Hunter went the whole way with make-up, wig and dress

'We are delighted to see the success of the no make-up selfie viral campaign. It is great to see the British public getting behind the campaign and helping to raise awareness of breast cancer.

'Here at Breakthrough, we have seen a huge spike in the number of unique visitors to our website, smashing our record to date. We have received hundreds of donations from people simply texting PINK to 70300 in the past 24 hours. We would like to thank all those who have supported us, enabling our scientists to continue their life-saving research.

'Breast cancer is not yesterday’s problem; every ten minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Anything that gets the public behind this important cause is to be celebrated. It isn’t too late to get involved, so go ahead and text PINK to 70300.'

Wayne Mcgregor looks, erm, pretty in pink and a splash of lilac.

Nathan Reynolds was on trend with a strong brow. He definitely didn't obey the natural lip rule for spring though.

Most women usually shy away from the camera if they're not wearing at least a slick of mascara or a pop of colour on their lips.

But anyone using social media over the last 48 hours can't fail to have noticed a flurry of snaps featuring women with no slap on.

In fact the trend has taken Twitter and Facebook by storm with thousands of females wiping off their make-up and posting photos using the hash tag #NoMakeUpSelfie.

Everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on Twitter and Facebook.

Though nobody seems to know where the idea came from, the rule seemed to be that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to do the same with all posting that the photos were to 'raise awareness of cancer'.

After becoming aware of the flurry of selfies, Cancer Research sent out a tweet saying: 'We’re loving your #cancerawareness #nomakeupselfie pics! The campaign isn’t ours but every £ helps #beatcancersooner.'

Cancer Research says so far it has raised £1million in 24 hours.

Cancer Research UK, while not affiliated with the #nomakeupselfie hashtag, are supporting it

Those posting the selfies or nominating others to do so are texting the word BEAT to 70099 TO DONATE £3.

Carolan Davidge, director of communications at Cancer Research UK said, “The #nomakeupselfie Twitter trend isn’t something Cancer Research UK started – but it’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family. If people would like to choose to support our work to beat cancer sooner, they can visit www.cruk.org.”

Sisters Natalie Kirby, left and Joanne Kirby, far right, posed make-up free. Joanne's daughter Charlotte also put in her support.

It's not known where or how the trend for using a no make-up selfie started this time around although last week author Laura Lippman caused an online storm with a similar campaign in support of actress Kim Novak and her appearance at the Oscars.

Now, following this new viral selfie campaign the Facebook group No Make Up Selfie For Cancer Awareness has more than 153,690 likes and hundreds of photo uploads.

Cancer
 survivor Deborah Ferguson from Liverpool submitted her photo to the 
Facebook group and agreed to have it published on MailOnline.

She
 said: 'Can I campaign on behalf of all neglected boobies please? Give 
them a check,  I did that's why I have such a big smile as am a survivor.'

Another participant., Abigail Spillman said: 'I think it is a fantastic way to raise awareness. Its only been going on since yesterday and already it is trending worldwide.

'Along with a #nomakeupselfie and a small donation (if you wish) is a massive help. Well done on using Facebook and Twitter for putting it to good use!'

Sophie Williams, who works for a PR firm, told MailOnline she posted her #nomakeupselfie and promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK.

Dancer Felixy Splits posted a fresh 
faced pic, and told MailOnline: 'Everyone knows someone who has suffered
 from this awful disease.

'It's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can. Make a difference and do something positive today.'

Katie Weirwas nominated by her friend and by doing so she donated £5 to the charity

Katie Weir of Freya Lingerie also joined in.

She told MailOnline: 'Through the recent nomination trend on Facebook it is easy to see the power of social media and how quickly posts can go viral.

'It is fantastic to see young women embracing their make-up free faces to raise awareness of breast cancer.

'I was nominated by my friend and by doing so I donated £5 to the charity which I wouldn't have done if I hadn't seen the status!'

Social media users have taken the internet by storm posting no-makeup selfies

And it's not just women who are getting in on the action. In solidarity, men too have com up with their own way of raising awareness - but they're slapping on the make-up.

Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her 12-year-old little brother Zach in full make-up.

She
 wrote: '[He] decided to put the make-up on as us girls are taking it of 
all to help cancer awareness, so proud of him to do this at such a young
 age! Bless him lots of likes for this young man people xxx'
