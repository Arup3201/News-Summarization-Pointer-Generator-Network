Care home manager Patricia Thomas, 48, told an elderly woman she had 'saggy' breasts

A care home manager who joked about an elderly dementia sufferer's breasts has escaped a ban from nursing as long as she takes a training course in 'communication'.

Nurse Patricia Thomas, 48, was found to have pointed at the grandmother's chest and told her to 'tuck her breasts into her skirt'.

But she will be allowed to keep working in the profession - as long as she takes a course studying 'patient dignity'.

A disciplinary hearing was told how Mrs Thomas made the shocking comment in front of her victim's family as they visited her in the private care home.

Granddaughter Martine Farrow said: 'Mrs Thomas turned to my grandmother and said: "Look at those saggy t**s" while pointing towards her chest area.

'Then she said: "I say that to her every morning".

'My nan has large breasts and has always been very conscious of them. I know that comment must have been very upsetting for her.'

A disciplinary hearing was told the incident occurred at Ty Gwynno Care Home in Pontypridd, South Wales, where Thomas was the manager.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) misconduct hearing in Cardiff was told the elderly dementia sufferer, in her eighties, refused to wear a bra because it was uncomfortable.

Thomas denied making the cruel comments but the NMC panel ruled she had referred to the elderly woman using the phrase 'saggy t**s' and told her 'you need to tuck those t**s into your skirt'.

PE teacher Mrs Farrow said her grandmother was a 'well respected lady' who would have been stunned by the language used.

She said: 'Mrs Thomas didn't think there was anything wrong with the comment she made. My concern was this was not the first time Mrs Thomas had said this to my nan.

'If a manager behaves this way then staff may think it is acceptable to behave this way. I didnâ€™t challenge her at the time because I was in shock - I was completely gobsmacked.'

Mrs Farrow
 said her family had been 'brought up extremely well' and would never 
dream of using bad language in front of their grandmother.

She added: 'I would treat my nan with the utmost respect and it was not acceptable to talk around her like that.

'I was completely gobsmacked by what Mrs Thomas said. It was very unprofessional.'

The woman's granddaughter Martine Farrow said her grandmother was a 'well respected lady' who would have been horrified by the language used

Thomas was
 suspended after Mrs Farrow reported the incident to another manager at 
the care home which looks after 50 elderly residents.

Thomas did admit saying before this incident: 'If you don't wear a bra in your 20s and 30s, you will have to tuck them in your skirt in your 70s and 80s.'

The NMC panel ruled her conduct amounted to gross misconduct and that her fitness to practice was impaired.

They gave her a 12 month conditions of practice order meaning she will have to undergo retraining.

This will include lessons on ensuring patient dignity and communications skills. She will also have to write a 'reflective piece'.

Panel chair Paul Morris said: 'The resident was distressed by the comments about the size of her chest.

'As a manager of this care home you were a role model and you should have led by example.

'You breached fundamental tenants of the nursing profession by displaying a lack of respect towards a vulnerable patient.

'Your conduct was not born out of malice but what you said was a hugely inappropriate error of judgement.'
