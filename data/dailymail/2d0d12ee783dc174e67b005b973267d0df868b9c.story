Lego is coming under fire from traditionalists with accusations its sets are reducing the scope for imagination and play.

Bloggers and parents have become increasingly alarmed that its kits, whether it is Star Wars or Minecraft, involve building a specific model, using specialist pieces according to strict instructions.

They worry it takes away the pleasure and ambition involved in a child just sitting with a box of bricks and creating something from their own imagination.

Parents and bloggers complain that new Lego is not as good for children as the old fashioned plastic blocks 

The debate has been triggered by British blogger, Chris Swan, who complained: ‘The problem is sets that only make one thing like a dragon or something licensed from a movie.’

The IT expert who was previously in the Royal Navy said: ‘I must have got my first Lego when I was about three or four. It was pretty basic stuff – mostly 4×2 blocks and a handful of 2×2 blocks.

‘I remember building a house out of it, and being shown by my mum to overlap the bricks to make a strong wall rather than building straight towers that would easily fall.’

He added: ‘Lego for me was always about creativity, remaking and improving on existing designs. Those things don’t happen with sets that are designed to build a model of a single thing.

‘But that’s not the only problem – Lego taught me the art of creative destruction – the need to break something in order to make something better.

‘Single outcome sets encourage preservation rather than destruction, and sadly that makes them less useful, less educational and in my opinion less fun.’

His comments coincide with the launch of The Brick 2014 show for Lego enthusiasts, which opens today in London.

It appears his fears have some powerful advocates. The Nobel Prize-winning chemist Sir Harry Kroto argues that British-designed Meccano, which involves putting nuts and bolts together, is of greater educational value because it mimics real-life engineering.

Blogger Chris Swan complained that the branded Lego gave children fewer options than ordinary blocks 

He says: ‘There is no comparison. Children should start with Lego, which is basically a toy, and its basic units are bricks. We do not build cars and other machines out of bricks.’

The issue was highlighted by the BBC, where contributors to a Facebook discussion disagreed over the impact of the changes made by Lego in recent years.

Graeme Gofton suggested it was evidence of dumbing down. He complained: ‘Even Lego now cannot let you think, you must build what they say.

‘In my day I had a bucket full and built my own x wing, shuttle, castle or anything I wanted.

‘Now you build what’s on the box and don’t you dare think for yourself and get creative you might grow up to be a thinker.’

Sarah Smith countered: ‘My son loves to follow the instructions, great for spatial learning. Once he’s played with it enough he dismantles and creates his own stuff.’

Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek  denied the sets are less creative. He said: ‘Children still get bricks and they can combine them. The bricks will probably end up in big boxes in homes and that acts like a pool of creativity.’

A Lego spokesman denied the claims suggesting the branded boxes inevitably get combined with other Lego

The brick count on the larger sets has risen in recent years. Top of Bricklink’s list is the model of the Taj Mahal, released in 2008, with 5,922 parts. This took over from a limited-edition Star Wars/M&Ms mosaic, sold in 2005, which had 5,462. The Star Wars Millennium Falcon of 2007 required the assembly of 5,174 pieces.

Modern themed Lego sets linked to big budget films can be very expensive. For example, the LEGO Super Heroes Batcave comes in at £111.19, while the Lord of the Rings set called ‘The Battle of Helm’s Deep’ is £174.99.

Its Star Wars sets remain hugely popular with a version of the Millennium Falcon costing £95.

It is still possible to buy a box of bricks to allow youngsters to build their own toys and games. A 650 piece ‘Basic Bricks Deluxe’ box comes in at £20.99.
