Cameron Pearman suffered puncture wounds to his legafter being bitten by a two-metre shark

Unshaken by the attack, the 13-year-old rode 2km home and ate some raisin toast before his father took him to hospital

'It came up underneath me and bit my leg. Then it just swam off, Pearman said.

'I only saw it for a split second, just a head and a tail. I had a bit of an adrenalin rush, so I didn't really feel it.'

Afterwards, he rode his bike 2km home and ate some breakfast, before his father demanded he go to hospital.

'I had some raisin toast, it was good,' Pearman said.

'Dad was home, he didn't believe me when I casually said 'I got bitten by a shark'.'

Surf Life Saving WA told Daily Mail Australia that the young surfer made his own way back out of the water when an off-duty life saver Bruce Ridley and his cousin administered first aid.

It was the first time that Cameron had returned to the water since recovering from a broken wrist.

Pearman said he looked down and saw the head and tail for a split second, but otherwise he 'didn't really feel the attack' 

Surf Life Saving WA spokesman said the shark's mouth must have been quite large because the one bite created 8-9 punctures and there was a reasonable amount of blood

A Surf Life Saving WA spokesman said the shark's mouth must have been quite large because the one bite created 8-9 punctures and there was a reasonable amount of blood.

'With the force it could have been far worse,' he said. 'Cameron wants to go surfing again tomorrow but his father wasn't too sure.' 

In a tweet, SLSWA said a medium-sized shark of and unknown species was spotted at 7:45am near the Port Bouvard Bridge. 

The beach is expected to remain closed for 24 hours,  SLSWA tweeted.

The story has made waves overseas, after Australian NBA player Andrew Bogut posted the news on Twitter.

'Aussie aussie aussie!: Kid gets bitten by shark, goes home for raisin toast', he wrote.
