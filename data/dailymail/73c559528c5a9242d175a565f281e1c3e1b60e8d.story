We readily sit down to watch TV, or read books, or listen to music on the radio.

But there is one sense we rarely record and play back - the sense of smell - even if we can all recall our favourite scents, such as the smell of coffee in the morning, a freshly-cut lawn or the salty bracing smell of sea air.

Now, graphic designer and photographer Kate McLean has been combining her love of maps with her desire to explore our overlooked sense, leading to 'sensory maps' of cities around the world.

Each map is a labour of love as well as a lot of labour, with Kate moving around each city, meeting the people who live and work in the various districts, and then capturing and re-creating the smells she encounters to create the maps.

Her experiences have led her to the fishermen of the River Clyde in Glasgow, who occasionally have to pull bodies from the water, to the 'smelliest' block of New York, as well as the olfactory delights of Paris and the fresh sea air of Newport in Rhode Island.

All have all come under the keen observation of her nose, and found their way into her maps.

Paris, distilled: Kate builds a map of each city, guided by her own experiences and the observations of local people

Kate
 says her aim is to sensitize tourists and visitors to a new place, and 
use a 'largely-ignored sense in their perception of that place'.

She
 said: 'Smell has a "do not enter brain processing" connection with our 
emotions, making smell the supreme retainer of memory over our other 
senses.

'We have 100 per cent smell recall after one year but only 30 per cent sight memory after three months.

'The
 first time we smell a new scent we automatically associate it with 
whether we like it or not (positive or negative) and we associate it 
with the location where we smell it.

'Therefore I propose that smell can be used in tourism marketing to foster lasting memories of a place.'

How does Glasgow smell to you? Scents picked up by Kate McLean include perfume, fast food, building dust and 'hot bovril at the footy'

Speaking to her alumni publication for Suffolk University, she said: 'Maps are an old graphic device of data visualization.

'Maps
 show proximity, range, location – all characteristics of smell that are
 difficult to explain verbally in any kind of a coherent way.

'Moreover I have been fascinated by maps since I was a small child.

'I
 wanted to make maps but realized, at ten years of age, that the world 
had already been discovered. So, if the physical, geographical world has
 been represented then I just had to discover a new territory – my 
landscape is the smell-scape.'

New York's smelliest block: Cabbage, car oil, dried fish, cheap perfume and A/C all combine to make this a smell to remember

Kate started with Paris 'because it has astonishing emotion-inducing scents.

'The
 Paris smell map is a virtual dérive, a collection of perfumes placed on
 shelving on a board showing Parisian streets. Audience members walk a 
pace at a time to sniff as they "wander" the city’s streets.

'I
 moved on to Edinburgh. That city has one pervasive smell – identified 
as malt extract from the breweries – which sweeps the city’s streets, 
but the secondary smells are equally evocative.

'The
 maps themselves do not smell; instead I make up individual scents using
 only natural ingredients that best reflect the smells I have selected 
to depict visually.

'Each 
scent is stored in its own bottle which is stored in a small cabinet 
underneath the map. I prefer to keep the contents of the bottles hidden 
so that the audience cannot rely on visual cues to identify the smells.

'For
 this reason I do not label the smells. I make most of the smells 
myself, trying to capture and hold elusive scents in the small bottles.

'I
 have learned how to distill rose petals, to create a perfume of stinky 
cheese, to depict the smell of penguins at the zoo without harming a 
single penguin. I can fabricate the smell of a building site and of 
boy’s toilets in primary schools.'

From the smells of sea, sand and beach to boys toilets in primary schools. You may not agree with Kate's descriptions, but she does paint quite a sensory picture

Each
 project varies slightly as I amend my methodology. Initially I decided 
on the smells based on personal experience. Then I started asking local 
residents of the city in question to provide me with the smells that 
they associate with their environments.

This progressed to asking for comments via my blog and to asking local media to help solicit responses.

'Overall
 there is nothing to beat talking to local people, and in Newport I took
 time to devise a couple of smell walks and a wonderful smell bike ride.
 Bikers are keen sniffers!

'The
 resulting conversations revealed a vast amount of data including 
numerous descriptions of the ocean smell from the bikers (ocean, salt, 
weed, brine, home, fog) and a collection of urban aromas that combined 
the smell of homes, transport and business with the overall heady aroma 
of freshly frying bacon just outside the Newport police station.'
