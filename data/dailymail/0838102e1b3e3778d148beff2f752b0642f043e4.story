Ticket to ride: Gary Lineker, pictured with his wife Danielle, is chauffeured between Manchester and London after his Match of the Day duties at a cost of £15,000 to the BBC

You might expect someone earning a reputed £2million to be able to foot his own commuting bills.

But it seems the BBC has other ideas – and is splashing out more than £15,000 a year to cover Gary Lineker’s travel to work.

After finishing each Match of the Day show, the presenter has a chauffeur waiting to drive him from the Corporation’s new studios in Salford to his home in London.

The BBC also pays for the former England captain’s first-class train ticket from London to Manchester to begin filming each week.

This is despite Lineker, 51, taking home one of the highest salaries at the Corporation.

The broadcaster’s official policy is not to pay travel expenses for freelance presenters who live in the South-East and work in Salford – meaning other hosts, such as Radio 5 Live’s Victoria Derbyshire, have to meet these costs themselves.

But Lineker’s contract was signed before the Corporation’s move to the Greater Manchester site was confirmed.

It is understood to have guaranteed to provide his travel to and from the programme.

Since the move, however, Lineker’s 200-mile chauffeur-driven trip home from work can take up to four hours and costs around £350.

He makes the journey 40 times a year, leaving his employer with an annual bill of about £14,000. His rail tickets are thought to cost a further £1,500 every 12 months.

The BBC insists the first-class fare 
is justified to ensure the presenter’s privacy, and claims the 
chauffeur-driven car is necessary because filming finishes after the 
last London-bound train has left Manchester.

But
John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport 
select committee, said: ‘It is very difficult to see how the BBC can 
justify this given the amount Gary Lineker is paid, particularly if 
people on much lower salaries have to pay transport costs themselves.’

The revelation has also irritated staff members who have uprooted their families and moved to the North-West to keep their jobs.

One said: ‘Why are people who are 
being paid such a vast sum of money already not being told that if you 
want to work for the BBC, you have to move near your place of work?

'There is a feeling so-called talent get things other members of staff don’t get.’

Two
years ago, the Daily Mail revealed that the BBC was spending thousands 
of pounds each year on taxis to take Match of the Day pundits Alan 
Shearer, Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson from the studios in London to 
their homes in the North-East and North-West.

The BBC declined to comment on current travel arrangements for its pundits, but a spokesman said: ‘The BBC is obliged to honour any existing contract that stipulates that it meet the cost of travel and we always ensure that the costs are kept as low as possible.’

Lineker’s agent said: ‘We have no comment whatsoever.’
