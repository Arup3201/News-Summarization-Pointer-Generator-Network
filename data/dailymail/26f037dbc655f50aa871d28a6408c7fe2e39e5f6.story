Passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow after three icebreakers failed to reach the paralysed vessel - but it could still be weeks before they reach dry land.

A helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers trapped on the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy when there is a break in the weather.

Ironically, the Akademik had gone in search of evidence of the 
world’s melting ice caps but instead the team of climate scientists had to abandon their mission because the ice is 
thicker than usual at this time of year.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said the rescue would be a complex operation.

The research team had hoped the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis (seen here yesterday) would be able to crack through the thick ice and allow them to continue on their way

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the rescue would be a complex operation - and it could be several weeks before the passengers reach dry land. Above, Akademik expedition leader Greg Mortimer gives a briefing about the ice conditions yesterday

'The helicopter is unable to fly in the current weather conditions and will hold off on the rescue until conditions improve,' AMSA said in a statement.

'Weather conditions are unlikely to start improving until tomorrow and decisions related to carrying out the rescue may be made at short notice.'

The 22 members of the crew - who have built an icy helipad - will stay behind with the ship and wait for the ice to break up naturally, expedition spokesman Alvin Stone said.

They had hoped the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis would be able to crack through the thick ice and allow them to continue on their way. 

The ship isn't in danger of sinking, and there are weeks' worth of supplies on board, but the vessel cannot move. Above, the research team drill into the ice

The Aurora came within 20km (12 miles) of the ship on Monday, but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water.

Today, the weather remained bleak, and the crew on the Aurora said their vessel would also be at risk of getting stuck if it made another rescue attempt.

The Snow Dragon, which is waiting with the Aurora at the edge of the ice pack, was also unable to crack through the ice, as was France's L'Astrolabe.

The passengers will be flown back to the Snow Dragon in groups of 12, and then transferred by barge to the Aurora.

John
 Young, AMSA emergency response division general manager, said the 
Aurora Australis will then take several days to make its way to the 
Casey Base in Antarctica to refuel before returning to Hobart in 
Tasmania.

'It will be a couple of weeks before they are landed,' he told Ninemsn.

The Chinese icebreaker Xuelong - meaning Snow Dragon - was deployed to rescue the Russian science ship

However just before midnight on Friday Captain Wang Jianzhong's ship (pictured) also became trapped

Scientists on board the Xuelong, including Liu Shunlin (left), are now studying the condition of the Russian ship while they wait to be freed themselves

A photograph sent in by the captain of the Russian ship suggests that the two vessels can actually see each other, albeit as a tiny speck on the horizon

It is believed a simple shift in the wind could free the Akademik.

Winds from the east have been pounding the ship and pushing the ice around the vessel.

A westerly wind would help break up the ice, Stone said. The trouble is, no one knows when the wind will change. 

The ship isn't in danger of sinking, and there are weeks' worth of supplies on board, but the vessel cannot move.

The
 expedition, which set off from New Zealand on November 28, is being led
 by Chris Turney, a climate scientist, who was hoping to reach the base 
camp of Douglas Mawson, one of the most famous Antarctic explorers, and 
repeat observations done by him in 1912 to see what impact climate 
change had made.

Trapped: 74 people, including scientists, tourists and a Guardian reporter, are stuck in thick ice sheets

Crew members routinely check the hull of the ship, which gathers fresh layers of snow every night

The looming helicopter rescue means the expedition will have to be cut short, Stone said.

Still, those on board appeared to be taking it all in stride.

'Surprisingly, all the passengers seem to be considering it the adventure of a lifetime,' Stone said.

Turney has also posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing the Chinese vessel, a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice.

'Everyone well,' Turney added.

He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'.

The researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well-stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of Tasmanian capital Hobart

And he tweeted: 'Heavy ice. Beautiful; light wind. Only -1degC. All well. Merry Xmas everyone from AAE.'

Academic
 Shokalskiy, an ice-strengthened ship built in 1982, was originally used
 for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a 
passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica.

Marooned
 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart - the capital of the Australian 
state of Tasmania - the thick ice sheets built up during a bout of 
severe wind.

The Russian
 embassy in Australia has been in constant contact with the captain and 
said everyone on board was in good health and there was 'no threat to 
their lives or safety'.

The ship had been on a multi-day tour from New Zealand to visit several sites along the edge of Antarctica before getting trapped in sea ice

On
 board are scientists from the University of New South Wales, a 
journalist from The Guardian and dozens of tourists who have paid to be 
part of the recreation of Mawson’s expedition.

The research team has made contact with local stations from the Commonwealth Bay to say they are well-stocked with food.

They are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets.

A
 spokesman for AMSA said: 'It is quite a remote part of the world, but 
we have everyone safe. The vessel isn't in any immediate danger.'

France's L'Astrobe, also deployed to save the ship, has now turned back
