One man claims that the New York subway is a great place to meet women - in fact, he's talked to roughly 500 while on the train.

Brian Robinson, the author of How to Meet Women on the Subway, points out that the NYC transit system is a cost-efficient alternative to bars and restaurants, and offers endless options with its millions of daily commuters.

'Women wouldn't expect to meet nice guys on the subway, so you can have a surprise attack,' the 48-year-old tells MailOnline.

Love train: Brian Robinson, seen in a promotional image for his new book How to Meet Women on the Subway, says the NYC transit system is a great place to find dates

He spent roughly 14 years using this technique before he eventually met his wife on Match.com and got married last year.

Mr Robinson says his go-to icebreaker was asking for directions. He'd add: ‘It sounds like you have an accent. Where are you from?’

'Since 98per cent of people in New York City are from someplace else, no matter what their answer is, I’d go "Oh, that’s amazing, I've always wanted to go to Montreal, or Paris," or wherever she’s from.’

Icebreaker: Mr Robinson, who used this technique for 14 years, says his go-to move was asking for directions

Screen time: He'd then say his stop was approaching and ask for the woman's email address to keep the conversation going

He would then say, 'Oh, my stop is coming up, I would love to keep talking to you,' and ask for her email address.

Icebreaker: Ask a woman for directions, then continue the conversation by asking where she's from and saying you've always wanted to visit.

Exit strategy: Ask for her email, then get off the train immediately - don't ask for a date while on the subway. 

Dress for success: 'You could be flipping burgers at night, but definitely wear a suit and look professional,' he says.

Friendly visitors: Seek out tourists, who are often 'looking to meet nice people' and 'in a good mood,' in popular shopping districts.

Free ride: Use an unlimited MetroCard to swipe in women when they're fumbling for their own, then pass along your business card and invite them to a party.

'I don’t care if your stop’s not for 30 minutes - you get off immediately. Once you've gotten some interest, then you leave. So you're not asking her out on the subway, because it's just too awkward,' he advises.

The Brooklyn resident, who has spent most of his career in advertising sales, says that the key to not seeming creepy is to be genuine.

'If you're polite and you're genuine and you're nice, women will sometimes let the wall come down and they're like "he’s not so crazy after all." And before you know it, you've got the email or the phone number and you leave and they haven’t really thought "Oh, I've just given someone my number on the subway,"' he says.

'When you meet somebody that’s interesting, it doesn't matter if you’re downtown at the court waiting to pay a ticket. You’re going to start engaging with somebody who’s charming.'

While he says a few of these encounters turned into six-month-plus relationships, not every attempt went smoothly.

'There was one woman who almost pulled out her Mace when she looked at me. I’m a nice guy and I don’t know what happened, but she got scared and she reached into her purse and all I said was '"Hey, how’s it going?"' he says. 

Well suited: Mr Robinson says it helps to dress professionally when approaching women

Welcome to New York: Mr Robinson says that tourists are usually 'really friendly' and 'looking to meet nice people'

For those who think his book advocates harassment, he wants to clarify that it's meant to be lighthearted and humorous.

'It’s not about sleeping with women, it’s about meeting women,' he adds.

Mr Robinson offers plenty of other tips in the self-published book, which was released October 9 - for example, it's important to dress for success. 

The art of small talk: Mr Robinson says that more men could meet women on the subway if they knew how to strike up a conversation

'Even if you’re unemployed and living in your mom's basement, a suit gives the perception that you're working, that you're successful, that you've got a job,' he says.

He also suggests using an unlimited MetroCard to offer women free swipes when they're fumbling for their own.

'As you go up to swipe them, you have your business card in your other pocket and you say, "I’d love to invite you to a party, or a book-signing. My contact information is on my card." If you give five of those cards a day, five days a week, that's 25 cards given out a week.'

He also advises talking to tourists.

'Women who are tourists here are really friendly, looking to meet nice people. They're relaxed, they’re in a good mood. So go to the shopping districts and you’ll see them pulling out their maps, carrying their Century 21 bags. They're definitely prime targets.'

Mr Robinson says that more men could find dates on the train if they knew how to approach women properly and strike up a conversation.

'A lot of men and women have this perception that they're going to be relaxed and open to meeting somebody on a date or on a dating site or restaurant or being introduced by friends. But people meet all the time in the most unfamiliar settings,' he says.

'You can get dates anywhere, but the subway’s a great spot because it’s New York City and everybody has to take it.'

How to Meet Women on the Subway is currently available on Amazon for $12.95.
