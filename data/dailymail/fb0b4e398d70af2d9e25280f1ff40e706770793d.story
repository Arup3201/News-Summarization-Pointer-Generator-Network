Murdered: Prom queen Maren Sanchez was killed on the morning of the big dance last Friday

Huge crowds gathered to mourn a 15-year-old girl who was stabbed in the neck just hours before her junior prom.

Maren Sanchez's jilted friend Chris Plaskon, also 16, will appear in court today charged as an adult - with police saying he may have murdered her because she turned him down as a date.

Distraught classmates queued down the street to pay their last respects at a funeral home in Milford, Connecticut.

It is said Maren will be buried in her gown with the rose her boyfriend gave her for prom night.

Sherry Johnson, a health care worker at Bridgeport Hospital, told the New Haven Register: 'It could have been anyone’s daughter... It could have been my daughter.'

Her daughter Katie, 15, added: 'There’s still a lot of support going on for her. I can’t really picture how horrific it was for [her classmates].'

Therapy dogs were used outside the wake and the nation's reporters and broadcasters were given their own area, at a respectful distance from the mourners.

One family friend said Maren 'looked beautiful in there'.

The stabbing has sparked a national debate about school safety.

Sanchez, a member of the National Honor Society who was active in school drama, was killed in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School last Friday on the morning of her prom.

She had organised the dance herself and was set to be prom queen, her friends said.

Grief: Mourners queued down the street yesterday in the small seaside community, which has been rocked by the stabbing. Maren's friend Chris Plaskon will appear in court today charged with murder as an adult

Crowds: People arrive for the wake yesterday at the Cody-White funeral home in Milford, Connecticut

Mourning: Grieving pupils wore shirts and ribbons in purple, her favorite color, and released purple balloons

She died of wounds to her torso and neck, and her boyfriend is still reeling from her death, his father told MailOnline.

Jarrod Butts, 16, was due to take Maren to prom but instead attended a memorial for his girlfriend, holding her prom dress.

Speaking briefly on his doorstep on Sunday, 
Mr Butts said his son had been 'hit hard' and was spending time with friends as they try to cope
 with the devastating loss together.

According to a police affadavit, a witness saw Plaskon on top of the 16-year-old victim during the attack, and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away.

Another saw him discard a bloody knife.

Plaskon was inside the principal's office with bloody clothes when an officer arrived and asked what happened, the affadavit continued. 'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied.

He was arraigned earlier this week at a psychiatric facility, where he is undergoing medical examination.

The small seaside community has been devastated by Maren's death.

Earlier this week Connecticut Governor Dannel P Malloy joined tributes to Maren which saw friends releasing purple balloons and tying purple ribbons together, in honor of her favorite color.

Plaskon's family said they joined the community in mourning the loss of life as they struggled to understand what led to the crime.

'Words can only fall short in conveying the depth and breadth of the raw sadness we are left with by this unimaginable tragedy,' the family said.

'We join with the entire Milford community to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of this most vibrant and exceptional young woman.'

His family thanked relatives, friends and neighbors for reaching out to them in what they called their darkest hour.

'We pray for the wisdom to guide us as we desperately try to pull together the shattered pieces of our families,' the family said.

On Saturday Jarrod Butts posted a touching photograph of his girlfriend laughing on Twitter.

He posted just three words, 'I miss you.'

Police reportedly have Chris Plaskon, 16, in custody and friends have said that he knew Maren Sanchez since middle school

An emotional video uploaded to YouTube shows a sequence of photographs of Maren Sanchez set to music.

'My girlfriend,' reads the accompanying text. 'I will forever love and cherish her. R.I.P. 4/25/14.'

Plaskon is a ‘cutter’ who had previously attempted suicide and has a history of depression, his classmates have told MailOnline.

Friends say the suspect, who previously dated Maren in middle school, battled ADHD and other mental issues that led to sometimes bizarre behavior in the classroom.

'He just wasn't right. I know his cousin. He didn't act right,' 16-year-old Seamus O’Reilly said.

'He had depression.’

Tyler Curtin, 16, said he was very close to Plaskon when they played on the football team together as freshmen – though Plaskon’s behavior had changed recently and the two grew apart.

Plakson had previously tried to take his own life, Curtin said, adding: ‘He was dealing with a lot of things.’

He also began acting out and seeking attention from his classmates. For Halloween last year he wore a full bodysuit under his clothes and ripped his pants off in the middle of class, Curtin said.

Emotional: Butts posted this message to his Twitter account on Friday

‘He was always acting up and always looking for attention,’ he said. ‘Everybody thought it was funny at the time.’

Friends
 said that by all indications, Plaskon had a good home life. He lives in
 an apartment on Long Island Sound with his father, a contractor, and 
his mother and three brothers.

Classmates, even the ones who said 
they once knew Plaskon well, said nothing in his behavior had ever 
indicated he was capable of violence. 

‘He was such a nice, sweet kid,’ Curtin said.

On
 Saturday, most of Sanchez’s classmates gathered in the gym at the high 
school which administrators have into a makeshift crisis center.

Grief
 counselors were on hand to speak with students and teachers, many of 
whom witnessed the attack or its aftermath first-hand.
