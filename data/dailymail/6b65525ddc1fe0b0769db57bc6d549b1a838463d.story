Coaches at a high school in the U.S. face losing their jobs after they forced teenage athletes to 'bear crawl' around a running track as punishment for missing practice.

Some of the students - including one girl of just 14 - were left with bloodied and blistered hands after being made to make numerous laps of the track on all fours.

Cascade High School has apologised to parents for the 'inappropriate behaviour' of the four varsity track team coaches, who have all been suspended and are being urged to resign.

The punishments were doled out after just 12 students turned up for track practice at the school last Friday, according to a report on Wthr.com.

'Some missed because they had to do stuff for prom. One kid had a basketball game. One girl had a doctor's appointment and was told she had to do four laps,' one Cascade High School student said.

'Inappropriate': The school has issued an apology to parents, some of whom have called for the coaches to be sacked

Many of the students were left with large blisters after completing their 'bear crawls'.

Outcry: Some members of the varsity track team at the high school have spoken out in defence of their coaches

From
a standing position the students were told to lean over and lay their 
hands on the ground, using both their hands and feet to make their way 
awkwardly around the track.

'They were all black, and these were really red and they hurt even right now,' one girl said of her injured hands.

Some parents of Cascade High pupils have called for the coaches to be sacked, but many members of the varsity track team spoke out in their defence and said they were appalled to hear of their suspension.

Athlete Matt Shepard, who did not sustain blisters while bear crawling around the track, said the coaches 'didn't intend for us to get hurt'.

Fellow track team member Regina Solik said: 'I don't think there's a single person on this track team that says "I want them fired".'

She added that the coaches cared a great deal about the students they train.

The school district has contacted the Indiana Department of Child Services in light of the incident.

Assistant Superintendent Dr Jill Jay said in a statement the school did not condone or tolerate such behaviour from its employees.

She added that all four members of staff had been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into the incident, and that they had been asked to resign from their coaching positions.
