Victim: James Bulger, two, was murdered in 1993

Young children suspected of crimes could be spared trial under controversial plans raised by  a leading official.

Lord McNally, the new head of the youth justice quango, is the most senior serving figure to suggest the Government should look at raising the  age of criminal responsibility from ten to 12.

In his first interview since taking up the post in March, he also said Ministers should consider replacing traditional youth courts with informal panels similar to those in Scotland.

The Liberal Democrat peer, a justice minister until last year, claimed the main obstacle to the sweeping change was the fear of politicians that the media would say it meant the two ten-year-old boys who abducted and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool in 1993 would have got away with the crime.

He said this was ‘not true’, adding: ‘They would have been treated in a different kind of way, but they would not have got away with it.’

Critics, however, last night said victims would be let down if juveniles did not face court for serious offences.

Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘It’s an affront to common sense to presume young offenders of  11 or 12 who steal cars, assault people or trash people’s homes are unaware they are doing wrong.’

James Bulger’s mother Denise Fergus also attacked the suggestion, saying: ‘It is right that the politicians and judges should always remember what happened to James, the evil that was in his killers and the evil that lies there to this day.’

The age at which children in England and Wales can be prosecuted was set at ten in 1963. Until recently, Lord McNally stated publicly this was appropriate.

Calling for a review: Minister of State for Justice Lord McNally

But after being made chairman of the Youth Justice Board, a quango that funds child custody places, he is expressing a different view. Asked by Children & Young People Now magazine if he backed a review of the age limit, he replied: ‘Yes.’

Ministers have faced calls from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to raise the age of criminal responsibility.

The Youth Justice Board said Lord McNally was speaking personally and the age of criminal responsibility was a matter for the Justice Secretary.
