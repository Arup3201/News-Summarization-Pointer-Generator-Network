A study that says membership of the European Union is beneficial for Britain was last night branded a ‘Whitehall whitewash’.

Despite uncovering a catalogue of problems, the Foreign Office review found that the balance of power between Brussels and Westminster was ‘broadly appropriate’.

The report sparked anger among Tory 
backbenchers, who questioned why it was commissioned in the first place 
since the conclusions appear to contradict David Cameron’s policy of 
renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

Foreign Secretary William Hague: mandarins at the Foreign Office has concluded little needs to change in Britain's relationship with Europe

The review warned that:

But despite these issues, mandarins at the traditionally europhile Foreign Office concluded that little needed to change in Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

Six reports published by Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday are the first tranche of 36 studies on different aspects of Britain’s interactions with the EU.

A report on the European single market showcased the views of big business and concluded: ‘Integration has brought to the EU, and hence to the UK, in most if not all observers’ opinions, appreciable economic benefits.

Peter Bone: 'This sounds like a Whitehall whitewash. This is a government review, not a Conservative Party review.'

‘But it has brought with it a  regulatory framework which some find difficult to operate within or find burdensome.

‘Is
that trade-off, between cost and benefit, between economics and 
politics, of overall benefit to the UK? Most observers, and indeed most 
of the evidence received for this report, answer positively.’

The
report on health detailed concerns about the way the 48-hour working 
week restricts training for junior doctors and encourages foreigners to 
come to the UK for treatment on the NHS.

But
it concludes: ‘The current balance of competence between the EU and the
UK was considered by stakeholders to be broadly appropriate.’

A report on animal health and food safety detailed concerns that harmonisation of rules on pets travelling has ‘significantly heightened the risk of rabies returning to the UK’.

A report on international aid found that the ‘EU development programme management and delivery are overly complex and inefficient, and the EU does not systematically measure the results that EU aid achieves’.

Yet it concluded that ‘the advantages of working through the EU outweigh the disadvantages’.

Tory MP Peter Bone said the report should prompt the Tories to abandon the Coalition and seek to repatriate powers alone. He said: ‘This sounds like a Whitehall whitewash. This is a government review, not a Conservative Party review. This exercise was an irrelevance.’

Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is the same tired old actors regurgitating the same tired old script.

‘It is Sir Humphrey assisted by big corporate interests looking out to the world from their desks in Whitehall.

‘We need a referendum so 60 million people, not just Sir Humphrey, can have the final say.’

A total of 44,000 out of Britain¿s 144,000 doctors were trained in other European countries

One in three doctors working in Britain qualified abroad, prompting top medical groups to express concerns about how this could harm patient safety, the review found.

The report, which focused on the balance of power between Britain and the EU on health issues, revealed 44,000 out of Britain’s 144,000 doctors were trained in other European countries.

It also said out of 104,000 UK medical staff who are not doctors, around 34,000 hailed from other EU nations.

More than 9,000 GPs trained in Europe compared with 30,000 who qualified in Britain – meaning one in four learnt to practice medicine abroad.

And evidence given to the report by Health Education England showed that more than half of Britain’s nurses came from other countries within the EU.

Despite the alarming figures, the report concluded that continuing to ‘import’ doctors and other medical staff from countries around the EU would only improve the quality of the health service.

The report claims: ‘None of the responses suggested that the current balance of competence was wrong. Respondents recognised the benefit to the UK as a net importer of health professionals.’

But they admitted some of Britain’s leading medical groups have come forward to deliver warnings about possible safety issues.

In evidence submitted to the review, several groups stressed that more needs to be done to ensure foreign doctors have the qualifications and language skills to work in the UK.

The report said that ‘concerns were raised’ by the British Medical Association, the General Medical Council, the Royal College of Nursing, the Alliance of UK Health Regulators on Europe and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, among others, on ‘matters that impact on patient safety – namely medical training and language testing’.
