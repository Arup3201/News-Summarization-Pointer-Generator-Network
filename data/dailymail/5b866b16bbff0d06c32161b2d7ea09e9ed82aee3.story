Ed Miliband on the steps of 10 Downing Street, with his arm around Alex Salmond, alongside a grinning Gerry Adams.

That is the ‘nightmare’ image conjured up in a Tory attack advert released yesterday.

Mr Miliband, often mocked by satirists as looking like a character from the popular animated series Wallace and Gromit, seems to have had his features enhanced highlighting the resemblance. 

It was published after it emerged Labour ministers have been cosying up to the Irish Republican party Sinn Fein in an effort to convince them to join a potential future coalition.

Pat Doherty, the Sinn Fein MP for West Tyrone, told Channel 4 News he is ‘regularly badgered’ by shadow cabinet members about whether they would join a a coalition government led by Labour if it did not win enough seats to pass laws in the House of Commons.

‘They bring it up quite bluntly and it’s always dealt with in the same way,’ he said.

David Cameron brought up the issued at Prime Ministers’ Questions yesterday, saying: ‘We have seen Labour casting around for a coalition with the SNP and a coalition with Sinn Fein - the first time Britain would have people who want to break up Britain and bankrupt Britain. What a useless shower.’

Tory MP Ben Wallace, who served in Northern Ireland with the Scots Guards, said: ‘So desperate is Ed Miliband to get the keys to No 10, he would do a deal with the people who tried to blow it up.’

The poster carries the headline: ‘Your worst nightmare…just got even worse’ over two pictures, one of a grinning Ed Miliband in Downing Street, a second with him alongside former SNP leader Mr Salmond and Mr Adams.

Underneath the poster states: ‘The SNP and Sinn Fein propping up Ed Miliband? Chaos For Britain’

Labour reacted furiously to the claims.

Furious: A senior Labour source denied Ed Miliband's (pictured) party was ‘cosying up’ to Sinn Fein

A senior Labour source denied the party was ‘cosying up’ to Sinn Fein, but refused to rule out a future coalition.

Asked about the prospect of a coalition, the source said: ‘We are working towards a majority Labour government.’

He also denied that Ed Miliband ‘held any form of coalition talks’ during a recent visit to Northern Ireland.

‘The implication was that Ed was cosying up to Sinn Fein. That is not true.’

Senior Tory source said there was ‘zero prospect’ of a Tory deal with Sinn Fein or the SNP.

Currently Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons because they do not want to swear the oath of allegiance to the Queen.

In a statement last night, a spokesman said: ‘Sinn Féin’s position on Westminster is very well known. We do not take our seats.’
