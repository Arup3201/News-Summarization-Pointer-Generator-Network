Eight revelers were killed and at least six were injured last night when a gunman opened fire in a Colombia nightclub.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the attack, which is believed to have been carried out in revenge by a rival gang.

The shooting happened at the La Barra de la 44 club at about 9pm in Cali, Colombia's third largest city.

The victims appeared to be members of a gang who had clashed with rivals a few weeks ago, according to a police commander.

An employee of the city's prosecution service, who was in the bar at the time, was also shot dead.

A 20-year-old man who was carrying a pistol was seen fleeing the club. Police have since identified Johan Alexander Mosquera as their suspect.

However, according to club bouncer Reynaldo Campos several men had entered the club and started shooting, in an attack he claimed lasted for 20 minutes.

He claimed the men made their way through the three-storey club, picking off victims.

Colonel Alfredo Penilla of Cali Police, told Colombian newspaper El Universal however Cali police had established one person had started shooting indiscriminately, killing three people immediately.

Five other victims later died in hospital. Six people are still recovering from injuries in hospital.

The attack is believed to be related to the killing three weeks ago of a man known as 'Donkey'.Â 

Mosquera is due to appear in court later today on charges of murder, attempted murder and personal injury.
