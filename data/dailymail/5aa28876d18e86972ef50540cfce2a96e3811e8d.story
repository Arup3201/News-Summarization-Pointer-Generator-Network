Serial killer Joanna Dennehy has become engaged in prison to a builder whom she has never met.

James Budd, 48, of Worthing, West Sussex, had been writing about dogs to sadistic triple killer Dennehy, 31, and asked her to marry him - despite them never having spoken.

Dennehy - who listened to Elvis Presley songs as she tortured one of her victims - now plans to marry Budd at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, and walk down the aisle to Jailhouse Rock.

According to journalists Rob Pattinson and Shaun Wooller in The Sun on Sunday, Dennehy warned Budd in a letter: ‘You are declaring yourself to be the soulmate of a notorious serial killing psychopath. Lol. Not exactly girl next door.’

But he said he is not afraid of her, telling the newspaper: ‘We all need someone we can lean on… We’ve both been through a lot. We understand each other.’

Budd wrote to Dennehy, from Peterborough, in April with pictures of his Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Chunky, and she replied with stories about her German Shepherd named Hitler.

He popped the question in a letter in July, and she wrote back: ‘I would marry you in a heartbeat.’

Dennehy - who is already now signing her letters with the name ‘Joanna Budd-Dennehy’ - added: ‘You dress as Elvis and I’ll wear the canary suit. I’ll walk down the aisle to Jailhouse Rock.’

Budd was convicted of grievous bodily harm at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey in 1990 but received a reduced sentence after saying sorry to his victim, reported The Sun on Sunday.

He and Dennehy plan to ask the Prison Service for permission to marry at HMP Bronzefield in 2015.

Budd, who claims on his Facebook profile to have a daughter named Leah-Jo, attended Steyning Grammar School and Midhurst Grammar School in West Sussex, and is from Shoreham-by-Sea.

The tattooed builder is pictured wearing a
 Manchester United football shirt on his profile and has posted images 
of publicity posters for white nationalist group the British People's 
Party.

In his ‘About Me’ section, he says: ‘I am a 47-year-old father of a 16 year old daughter and currently single. I live on my own (hallelujah).

‘My best friend is my dog, a lunatic Staffy cross rescue dog, who thinks what's mine is hers (including my freaking bed).

'Have spoilt her rotten as she is the only female who has never let me down, answered me back or taken up with someone else.

‘Live a very boring life, same s*** 
every day. I don't drink but do smoke. I don't involve myself in other 
people’s bulls*** and don't expect them to get involved in mine.

‘I
 am polite and well-mannered but cross me and you “will” get f***** up 
for your troubles. Revenge is always best served cold and anonymously. 
Treat me as you would wish to be treated yourself.’

Budd then rants about wanting to 'stand and fight back' to immigrants in Britain who 'hate us'.

Dennehy became only the third woman in UK legal history to be handed a whole life sentence after she confessed to a triple killing, with the judge branding her 'cruel, calculating and manipulative'.

Dennehy fatally stabbed Lukasz 
Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee, and John Chapman last year - before Stretch 
drove her to Hereford where she randomly stabbed two dog walkers, who 
both survived.

A month-long trial heard that accomplices Gary Stretch, 47, and Leslie Layton, 36, were in the ‘thrall’ of Dennehy, who had already admitted the three murders and two attempted murders.

She ‘exploded’ into violence last March, first killing friend Mr Slaboszewski, 31, after luring him to a house by text.  She killed her housemate Mr Chapman, 56, and Mr Lee, 48, her married landlord and lover, ten days later.

All
 three victims were stabbed through the heart and their bodies dumped in
 ditches. Stretch then drove Dennehy 140 miles to Hereford where she 
stabbed Robin Bereza, 64, and John Rogers, 56.

Both
 suffered critical injuries but survived. Stretch and Dennehy were 
arrested that day. In the police custody suite she joked to officers 
about her ‘hectic week’.

While Stretch had driven Dennehy around and helped her pick victims, Layton joined him in helping to dispose of the bodies. Both claimed they had been acting under duress.

As well as Stretch’s convictions, Layton was convicted of perverting the course of justice and two counts of preventing a lawful burial. A third accomplice, Robert Moore, 56, 
who also lived in Peterborough, sheltered Dennehy and Stretch for a 
night and had admitted assisting Dennehy.

Joanna Dennehy

Dennehy is only the third woman to be given a whole-life prison term – along with Moors murderer Myra Hindley and House of Horrors serial killer Rose West – and the first to be given the term by a judge. Hindley and West were both handed the sentence by home secretaries.

The Old Bailey was told the killer had a ‘sexual and sadistic motivation’. Later she told a psychiatrist: ‘I killed to see how I would feel, to see if I was as cold as I thought I was. Then it got more-ish.’

Experts said Dennehy craved notoriety and wanted to humiliate her victims through sick sex games. Before the killings she had boasted she had already killed four times.

Stretch was jailed for life for two counts of attempted murder and preventing the burial of three people. He shouted ‘thank you very much’ after being told he would serve a minimum of 19 years. Layton was jailed for 14 years and Moore for three years.
