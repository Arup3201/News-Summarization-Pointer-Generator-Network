Talks aimed at resolving the London Underground ticket office dispute are to be held before a fresh round of strikes is due to be launched.

The conciliation service Acas said all parties involved in the row will meet on Friday.

The news was announced as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union continued a 48-hour strike which has led to travel disruption across the capital for a second day.

The walkout will end at 9pm tonight and is due to be followed by a three-day strike from 9pm next Monday unless there is a breakthrough to the deadlocked row over the closure of Tube ticket offices.

Travellers struggled through a second day of disruption in London today as a row over how effective the strike had been flared between RMT and London Underground (LU).

London Underground said most Tube stations were open and half the trains running - but the RMT disagreed

LU said it was running 52 per cent of Tube services today despite the 'pointless' strike, and carried 56 per cent of its usual passenger numbers this morning, which it said was a record for a strike day.

Around 80 per cent of stations were open and services ran on 10 of the 11 lines, said the company.

Nearly 90 per cent of the usual number of
 Oyster cards were used on Transport for London's network yesterday, 
according to the company.

But
 the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which organised the 48-hour 
walkout, accused LU of 'misleading' the public over the level of 
services, and of leaving platforms and stations 'dangerously 
overcrowded.'

The RMT, which will end the protest over planned ticket office closures at 
9pm tonight, with a further three-day stoppage planned for next week, insisted the strike remained 'rock solid'.

This morning queues built up outside Tube stations, many of which opened at 7am, with further queues at bus stops and taxi ranks across the city.  Meanwhile others took to two wheels to get to work, leaving Boris bike stands empty.

But unlike yesterday, not one Tube line was completely closed early this morning, and many found it easier to get into work than expected.

Mike 
Brown, managing director of London Underground, said adequate services 
were running on the transport network, where all 11 lines were open, and
 said 15 per cent more staff worked yesterday than during the previous 
strike. 

He also vowed that today's service would be an improvement on yesterday's.

He said: 'I'm sorry that 
Londoners are enduring more disruption today as a result of the RMT's 
pointless strike action.

'The only sensible course is for the RMT 
leadership to call off the strikes and get back to working with us to 
shape the future of the Tube, as the other three unions are doing.

'It was tough for our customers 
yesterday, but with more staff arriving for work than during the last 
strike in February, we were able to run 50 per cent of the train service and 
keep two-thirds of stations open.

'Nearly 90 per cent of the normal number of
 Oyster cards were used yesterday; we will be working really hard again 
to further improve this level of service.'

He
 appealed for fresh talks with the RMT, adding: 'Under our plans to modernise the 
Tube, we are committed to a safe railway with visible staff personally 
serving our passengers.'

Mr Brown said there would be no compulsory redundancies, 
and said LU had drastically altered their original proposals 'after listening to our people and the unions in over 40 meetings'.

He added: 'The
 RMT leadership know the real motivations behind their action, but it is
 infuriating that London's commuters and businesses are the ones who are
 being forced to pay the price with this unnecessary disruption.'

Bakerloo: Trains between Queen's Park and Elephant & Castle only

Central: Trains between Epping and Leytonstone, Woodford to Hainault, Hainault to Marble Arch, and White City to Ealing Broadway, and West Ruislip to North Acton

Circle: Trains between Hammersmith and Aldgate only

District: Trains between Upminster and Wimbledon, Ealing Broadway and High St Kensington, and Edgware Road and Wimbledon only

Hammersmith & City: Trains between Edgware Road and Barking

All the Tube lines were running, with some offering a normal service and others a reduced service today

Jubilee: Trains running on the whole line but with reduced frequency

Metropolitan: Trains between Amersham and Baker Street, Uxbridge and Harrow-on-the-Hill, and Harrow-on-the-Hill and Aldgate only

Piccadilly: Trains between Hammersmith and Heathrow T123, and Arnos Grove and Cockfosters only

Waterloo & City: Trains running earlier but now closed

DLR: Good service

London Overground: No service between Richmond and Willesden Junction while a signal failure is mended at South Acton

Northern: Good service

Victoria: Trains between Walthamstow Central and Seven Sisters and between Seven Sisters and Brixton

The RMT's acting general secretary, Mick Cash, said: 'It helps no-one for LU to deliberately mislead the public as to what services are available as it simply piles dangerous levels of pressure onto the ghost trains and skeleton operations, leaving passengers and staff at risk.

'You cannot turn the crucial issue of Tube safety into a high-risk PR stunt designed to do nothing more than prop up the political position and cuts agenda of this Government and London's Tory mayor.

'Instead of producing bogus timetables, Tube chiefs should be around the table responding positively to RMT's proposals for resolving a dispute which is about nothing more than cash-led cuts to jobs, services and safety.'

The Waterloo & City line was open for rush-hour but then closed, while all other lines were running.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Heathrow Express said it was transporting its usual daily volume of 17,000 people between the airport and London Paddington, despite an RMT strike in a separate dispute which was reducing its available workforce by two-thirds.

Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'The idea that this is a solidly supported strike is farcical. This action is the result of a minority of just one union, the RMT, who are refusing to see the logic of what we are trying to achieve.'

Yesterday Conservative vice-party chairman Bob Neill said: 'The RMT, who have been used to trying to hold London to ransom for a long time, don’t have the clout they used to think they have.

‘Londoners have voted with their feet and their Oysters cards and that’s a big wake-up call for the RMT.'

Meanwhile, a cafe has been criticised after putting a sandwich board outside banning members of the RMT.

Grill Market, in Holborn, north London, came under fire when a picture of the board, which also announced a discount for everybody not on strike, was posted on Twitter.

The sign read: 'No RMT Members. 10% off coffee for everyone else.'

Cass Horowitz tweeted a picture of the board with the caption: 'Saw this on the way to work? good to know London still has a sense of humour.'

But many angry Londoners failed to see the funny side.

While the manager of the eatery was quick to apologise for the sign and remove it, many angry Londoners vented their frustration at them online.

The manager tweeted: 'Again, total apology to anyone offended by the board this morning. Was only supposed to be a joke, clearly I got it VERY wrong.'

Despite the apology, dozens of people slammed the joke.

SeymourSan tweeted: 'How about an apology to those who's plight you belittled rather than an apology to all the people your boss saw you upset?'

Twitter user Hayrr added: 'I don't accept your apology. Offer a discount to the picketers.'

Alexeptable added: 'How could it be a joke in any way, shape or form? Do you know how jokes work?'
