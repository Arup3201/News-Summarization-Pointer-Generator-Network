The Monty Python stars launched their farewell show yesterday – with a little help from some lingerie-clad dancers young enough to be their granddaughters.

With the surviving Pythons now in their seventies, they have hired 20 dancers – ten male and ten female – to spice things up during their ten-date run at London’s O2, which begins tonight.

The girls, in costumes by underwear chain Agent Provocateur, are pictured with Michael Palin, 71, in a routine based on their 1970 sketch Blackmail.

John Cleese, 74, Terry Gilliam, 73, Terry Jones, 72, and Eric Idle, 71, also star in the £4.5million show, which will feature appearances by Professors Stephen Hawking and Brian Cox.

The Pythons also showed a spoof video of Sir Mick Jagger, 70, discussing the production with Rolling Stones bandmate Charlie Watts, 73, saying ironically: ‘It’s a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to make a load of money.’

The singer, who is seen watching the World Cup on TV, said they were just 'trying to relive their youth and make a load of money'.

Speaking to bandmate Charlie Watts, he adds: 'Who wants to see that again? It was funny in the 60s.'

'The best one died years ago. Maybe back in the 70s it was fantastic -- it was the funniest thing. We've seen it all before. I mean they've put it all up on YouTube.' 

In the run-up to the gig it was also revealed scientist Stephen Hawking is teaming up with the Pythons for their shows.

The
 cult comedy troupe - John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry 
Gilliam and Terry Jones - are kicking off their reunion gigs tomorrow.

Clever AND funny: Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking is teaming up with Monty Python for their highly-anticipated reunion shows

Hawking will appear in the show, at London’s O2, with Professor Brian Cox.

Speaking at a press conference in central London, Idle said: 'He’s a big Python fan so he was asked if he would.'

Monty Python’s Flying Circus was made for TV between 1969 and 1974 and generations of fans can recite lines and whole sketches.

Sixth Python Graham Chapman died of cancer in 1989 aged just 48, and nine years later the five remaining members shared a stage at the Aspen Comedy Festival in the U.S.

Cleese said the show, which includes a large cast of dancers and performers, set changes and special effects, costs around £4.5 million to stage.

Idle, who has done much of the planning for the shows, said the idea was 'to leave them wanting less'.

The press conference, at London’s Palladium Theatre, began with a promotional clip for the concerts featuring Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts discussing the concerts, with Jagger asking why the audience wanted to watch a 'bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth'.

But Idle said fans wanted to see the classic sketches which made their name, saying: 'It would be odd to try and write better things than our best at this age'.

Idle said he was not worried about jokes written decades ago being appreciated by a modern audience because they had not dated.

He said: 'It's mainly timeless actually because we were very fortunate and followed the satire movement in England and everything was topical so when we came along we tried to knock that.'

It was announced another 600 tickets would go on sale today.
