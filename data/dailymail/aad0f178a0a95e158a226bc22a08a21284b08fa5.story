It started off as a call about a television that was on too loud but led to police deploying 10 cars, officers in riot gear and an ambulance. 

The issue led to an eight-and-a-half hour siege and four people being arrested after complaints that a television was disrupting neighbours in Clackmannanshire in Scotland. 

After the stand off was over two police officers were seen carrying the offending widescreen television out of the flat in Alloa. 

Two police officers were seen removing a television from a block of flats in Clackmannanshire after being involved in an eight hour siege with occupants who allegedly refused to leave following noise complaints

Officers were called to the flat, in a five story block in Pine Grove, Alloa, Clackmannanshire, in response to a noise complaint from neighbours on Monday and arrived at about 1.30am. 

But the occupants allegedly refused to leave and the situation quickly began to resemble a siege, with officers in riot gear deployed and police locked in an eight-and-a-half hour standoff. 

One of the accused exited the property around 6.30am voluntarily and finally, at around 9.45am, police entered the flat and arrested the remaining three.

They were also able to remove the offending television. 

In total four people were arrested under Section 38 Criminal Justice and Licensing Act 2010 (threatening or abusive behaviour).

Liam Young, 26, Kirsty Taylor, 18, Ryan Kenneth Douglas, 22, and Carla Ann Gruar, 17, will all appear in Alloa Sheriff Court at a later date in connection with the allegations.

Mildred Gibson, 45, who lives above the flat where the incident took place and is aunt to Mr Young, said: 'There was no need for all those police officers and ambulances to assist four kids who had the TV up too loud.

'It couldn't have been up that loud because I live directly above the flat and I couldn't hear anything.' 

She said the noise of the television was not what woke her, but the police outside the flat. 

She said:  'There was everything outside my front door apart from a helicopter - over 10 police cars and about four ambulances.

'The police even had big Alsatian dogs with them, it was ridiculous.'

A photo was posted to Facebook of police outside the flats during the long eight-and-a-half hour siege 

Mrs Gibson's sister, Brenda Young, 58, Liam's mother, said she tried to get the noisy tv watchers out of the flat but the police wouldn't let her.

She said: 'When I seen all the police cars and ambulances I ran over to see what was going on - it was my son in there.

'I told the police I had a key and I would have the four of them out within two minutes but they wouldn't let me go near for 'safety reasons'.

'They've now removed both my son's TV and his Hi-Fi and I have to pay to get them back.' 

She said she felt police were acting like it was a hostage situation, rather than a group of noisy youngsters.  

Other neighbours reported hearing the noise of police and their dogs trying to get into the flat. 

A Police Scotland spokesperson said the occupants had 'refused to interact' with officers and would not leave the property.

The spokesperson added that as a result police 'had to escalate' their efforts to restore order, but 'there was no danger' to the public.

One of the accused, Kirsty Taylor, posted a photo on her Facebook page on January 5, showing police officers dressed in riot gear and armed with shields outside the property.

 The post was criticised by people who said it had caused resources to be wasted and caused a disturbance as children went to school.  

Kirsty Brand wrote: 'This is shocking like!

'Even wasting an ambulance on you lot.

'It would be a shame if someone really needed one and couldn't get it cause it was sat doing f***all waiting on all yous grow up.'

Adele Beresford wrote: 'It's a f****** joke. It's gonna be broad daylight soon, people going to work and kids going to school, shameful.'

Kirsty Ward wrote: 'Nice to see the the taxpayers' money being well spent. 'Funding all emergency services to sit there all that time.'

The property was later made secure and a council employee boarded the door up.

Officers were seen taking a number of electronic items including the flat screen TV which led to the noise complaint.

A spokesman for TaxPayerScotland said: 'The police are right to investigate a noise complaint, of course, but this does appear to be a remarkably heavy-handed and expensive response.

'You'd think the Force would have better things to do with its time.'
