Bob Dylan's 'secret' daughter has married her lesbian partner - but her famous father was a no show at the wedding.

Desiree Dennis-Dylan married her partner Kayla Sampson in June in an 'intimate' ceremony in Long Beach, California.

The wedding took place during a six-week gap in Dylan's Never Ending Tour Schedule, but sadly Dylan, a prophet of equality and social change in the 1960's, didn't make Desi's nuptials.

However her mother Carolyn Dennis - Dylan's ex-wife and former backup singer and a professional gospel/rock vocalist- did attend and performed Amazing Grace at the ceremony.

A guest told MailOnline: 'No, he was not there. I didn't see him, maybe he had a hat and glasses on but I didn't see anyone that looked like him.

'I would think that people would have surrounded him if he had.'

The wedding was held in a chapel in Long Beach, California, with a reception at a local seaside restaurant on the weekend of June 6.

Describing it the guest said: 'I would say there were probably 100 people, it was a pretty big wedding. It was in a chapel and then the reception was in a restaurant, in Long Beach by the water.

'The wedding was really pretty, very intimate.

'There was a lady who sang who was Desi's mom I believe. I think it was Amazing Grace.

'She sang and they had a friend of theirs sing a song. That was really nice.'

Bob Dylan was not mentioned during proceedings.

The guest said: 'The reception was outside and we sat around tables.

Times are a'changing: Little Desiree, with her mom Carolyn was kept a secret by the singer and his wife Carolyn Dennis  to protect her, they said

Celebrate:  Desiree was surrounded by friends and loved ones for her May nuptials.

Cut a rug:  Pop didn't play at Desiree's wedding, but the couple hired a great DJ. Dylan's name wasn't mentioned, said a guest

'The father of the bride danced with his daughter Kayla and Desi danced with her mom.

'They did not mention him (Bob Dylan) at the wedding or the reception. It was a really really nice wedding. They had a DJ.'

Desi does not discuss her famous father and the guest didn't even know until afterwards that she was Dylan's daughter.

They said: 'I didn't know until later (Desi was Dylan's daughter) I was surprised. But Desi's a sweetheart. 'I've not talked to them about the wedding but it was very nice.

'I don't recall a speech, they just said thank you for coming. They had a fabulous day.'

Another family friend, who didn't attend the wedding, told MailOnline: 'He was supposed to be there but I don't know if he ever did show up.'

Desi was born on January 31, 1986 and is now 28.

Her mother Carolyn Dennis, a gospel rock vocalist, was Dylan's second wife and once a backup singer for the star.

They married in a secret ceremony five months after Desi was born but they quietly divorced six years later in 1992.

The singer managed to keep both his second marriage and the existence of a daughter a closely guarded secret for 15 years, setting them up in a Los Angeles suburb and visiting discreetly.

But in 2001 the secret was exposed by writer Howard Sounes in his Dylan biography: Down The Highway.

Carolyn subsequently released a statement saying they both decided to keep their marriage private to give Desi a normal childhood.

They agreed that their daughter could choose to take her father's last name when she became mature enough to make a decision and she did – opting for the double-barreled Dennis-Dylan.

Musically talented herself, Desi sings and has traveled the globe as a 'performer, master teacher and featured musician' for the performing arts group The Young Americans, according to an online biography for Educators of America.

Her bio also says: 'She has had the privilege of sharing the stage with such artists as Jessica Simpson, Kelli O'Hara. Hugh Panaro, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Michael Crawford, Chaka Khan and Dick Van Dyke to name a few'.

Desi met Kayla while performing in the Young Americans.

Last year Kayla's mother Jolene Sampson said the family wouldn't know if Dylan was attending until the day, she said: ''Of course he's invited but he's just not going to go. He didn't say that but that's what we are assuming.'

Asked why she assumed he wouldn't attend, she said: 'He's very famous', but she quickly added that Dylan is supportive, saying: 'It would be sad but he is really supportive and happy for her.'

She later added, via an email: 'Some misinformation is about Bob attending the wedding. I have never met or spoken to him and have no idea of his opinion or ideas. We will only know the day of the wedding whether he will come or not, and that is not at all our focus for this celebration. Any opinion I had about his attending was pure speculation based on my own understanding of celebrity.'

MailOnline could not reach Desi or Kayla for comment.

Kayla's father Bruce Sampson just said: 'No comment, take care.'

A spokesman for the Young American's group at their office in Corona, California, said they had been asked not to comment.
