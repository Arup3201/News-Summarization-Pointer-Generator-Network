Internal affairs investigators from the New York Police Department have questioned officer Daniel Pantaleo for two hours in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. 

Pantaleo was cleared last week of criminal charges after a Staten Island, New York, grand jury declined to indict him. 

But now the NYPD is beginning its own investigation over whether Pantaleo broke departmental rules when he arrested Garner on July 17 for illegally selling cigarettes on the street, according to DNA Info.

Daniel Pantaleo was questioned for two hours by the NYPD's internal affair bureau on Monday about the death of Eric Garner

Dying: Eric Garner lost consciousness after he was put into an alleged chokehold by Pantaleo in July. He later died at a hospital

In amateur video taken of the arrest, Pantaleo appeared to put Garner in a chokehold before forcing him to the ground holding him down while he was being cuffed.

Garner, a father of six, passed after exclaiming 'I can't breathe!' He then died after being taken to the hospital.

His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo was not indicted. 

Chokeholds are banned by the NYPD, though Pantaleo denies using one on Garner - despite video evidence that has been widely interpreted otherwise. 

The medical examiner found that Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and 350lbs, died of a Heart attack resulting from compression of neck and of chest and 'prone positioning during physical restraint by police' resulted in his death. 

However, his asthma, obesity and other health problems were also blamed for his death.

Investigators with the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau questioned Pantaleo for two hours on Monday, according to DNA Info. 

'He pretty much told the same story he did to the grand jury, his actions, his thoughts, during the Garner encounter,' a police source told the news site.

The 29-year-old cop has been pulled off the streets and stripped of his badge and gun pending the outcome of the investigation. He still works at the NYPD on desk duty.

The investigation will likely take weeks, or even months, to conclude.
