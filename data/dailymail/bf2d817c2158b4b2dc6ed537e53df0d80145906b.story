Bob Day, 83, waited a year to have the tumour investigated - by which time it was the size of a football

A grandfather had a tumour the size of a football removed from his scrotum after waiting a year to see his doctor about it. 

The 9lb (4kg) growth was so bad that Bob Day’s relatives could spot it though his clothes and told him to go to the doctor.

Today the retired butcher from Speke, LIverpool, praised surgeons at the Royal Liverpool Hospital who managed to remove the huge growth.

Mr Day had a sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues, muscles and bone.

He is now urging others not to wait so long before being investigated. 

The 83-year-old noticed the swelling in his groin area but didn't want to make a fuss - so left it.

But over the next 12 months it gradually got bigger and bigger. 

He said: 'You could see it in my trousers. The tumour was getting bigger and bigger but I kept putting it off - I don’t like a fuss.

'I wasn’t in pain. If I had been in pain, I probably would have gone earlier. I was still doing the gardening and doing everything as normal.'

It was his daughter Jennifer, 54, and son Stephen who spotted the lump - and the fact their father was getting tired and sleeping in his chair more often.

Mr Day's GP referred him to a urologist at Liverpool's Broadgreen hospital last December and after a series of scans, he was booked in for surgery in February.

His daughter Jennifer, 54, added: 'With the size of it, I thought they were going to say it’s too late, there’s nothing we can do.

'When you think of cancer, you think that’s it. It is remarkable what they have done for him.'

Mr Day will have more scans every three months to make sure he remains cancer-free.

His surgeon, Mr Coonoor Chandrasekar, said: 'Lumps and bumps are common. One in 100 turn out to be a sarcoma.

'Sarcomas are treatable and if people come forward for treatment earlier, it can be easier.'

'If Bob hadn’t had it checked, because of the way tissue breaks down, it could have spread to his lungs which can prove fatal.'

Mr Day was diagnosed with sarcoma. These are rare cancers that develop in the muscle, bone, nerves, cartilage, tendons, blood vessels and the fatty and fibrous tissues. His tumour was found to weigh a staggering 4kg
