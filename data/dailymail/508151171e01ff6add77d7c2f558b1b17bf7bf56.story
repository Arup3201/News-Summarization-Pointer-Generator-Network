A 15-year-old boy could smell his own burning flesh after he blew off his fingertips with an illegal firework which he had lit to show his girlfriend.

Dylan Cosgrove panicked and put the explosive in his mouth in a desperate bid to put it out - before running to the corner of his bedroom and covering it with his hand.

The blast broke his right hand in seven places and snapped two tendons, with Dylan suffering permanent damage despite four and a half hours of surgery.

Burning flesh: Dylan Cosgrove, 15, blew off his fingertips after lighting an illegal firework in his bedroom

Injuries: The blast broke his right hand in seven places and snapped two tendons, with permanent damage despite four and a half hours of surgery. Dylan said he thought he would be able to extinguish the fuse

Dylan, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, had bought the firework as one of a set of ten from a friend for just £1.

He was planning to use them on Bonfire Night and decided to light one 'for a laugh' to show his girlfriend Erin Easton on October 8 - but to his horror, he was unable to extinguish the fuse.  

'I quickly realised the fuse wouldn't go out and went into a blind panic and didn't know what to do,' he said. 'I even put it to my mouth to try to put it out.

'That was crazy when I think about what could have happened if it had exploded in my face, but I was desperate to stop it going off.

'I tried to put it out by blowing on it like a candle and even tried licking it to extinguish the fuse but it wouldn’t work.

'I was frightened for my girlfriend and I didn't want to start a fire in my bedroom so I ran to the other side of the room to protect her from the explosion. 

'I thought the only thing left to do was to put my two fingers on it to soften the blow, but the next thing I heard was a huge bang.

'I couldn’t feel anything, I think my body was running on adrenaline. I knew I had been badly hurt. 

'My ears were ringing and I could smell my burning flesh.'

Dylan's father Michael Stephenson, 41, heard an 'almighty bang' and screaming before his son came running down the stairs 'white as a sheet'. 

'There wasn't any blood at first but it began to seep out over the floor when he sat down on the sofa,' he added.

An ambulance took the schoolboy to Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where an X-ray revealed his right hand had been broken in seven places.

He went through four and a half hours of surgery at the nearby Royal Victoria Infirmary and now has metal pins in several of his fingers.

The tip of Dylan’s index finger had been completely blown off, leaving the bone sticking out which had to be cut away. 

Two of his tendons  snapped and retracted  into his arm, reducing flexibility and causing damage from which he will never fully recover.

Fortunately, the schoolboy said, he is left-handed.

The pupil at St Robert of Newminster Catholic school in Washington, Tyne and Wear, said he bought ten of the fireworks for £1 from a classmate.

Although the packaging said they were UK approved, firefighters later told them the fireworks were illegal.

Dylan's mother, 39-year-old B&Q project co-ordinator Samantha Cosgrove, said she was 'in shock' when she heard the news.

'I just stood up in the restaurant and shouted, "my son's blown the ends of his fingers off"', she said. 'Goodness knows what people were thinking.

'He was in total shock and kept asking if he would be sent to prison.

'We would never let fireworks in the house and we know now how dangerous they can be. We destroyed the remaining ones.'

Dylan's mother Samantha (right) said: 'We would never let fireworks in the house and we know now how dangerous they can be'. She added: 'We never thought that he would do something like this in the house'

She added: 'We trusted Dylan and we never thought that he would do something like this in the house.

'Unfortunately he has had to learn the hard way. There should definitely be tougher restrictions on how people can purchase fireworks.'

The teenager agreed to make his case public to raise awareness.

Area Manager Kevin Gardner, of the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'I would like to thank Dylan and his family for telling their story, to try to prevent this from happening to anyone else. 

'I would urge anyone to report the sale of illegal fireworks to the police and not to buy them.

'Licensed fireworks are explosives but buying fireworks from non-reputable or licensed retailers is asking for trouble - you simply do not know what is in them or how they will react.'

Dylan added: 'Everyday life is so much harder now. I'll have to get the pins removed from my fingers in a few weeks and I'll need to continue to have physiotherapy for some time.

'I wish I could turn the clock back. This moment of madness could have cost me my life and I put my girlfriend in danger too. I've been extremely lucky'.
