A 15-year-old girl has run away with a 37-year-old family friend she met at church after the pair left a note professing their love for each other.

Emily Lalinsky and Robert Messer left her home in Plymouth Township, Michigan on Sunday and told her mother that they were going on a hiking trip - but the note, which was left behind with their cellphones, revealed they had no intention of coming back.

Messer, a recently divorced father-of-one who has known Lalinsky since she was a little girl, had written: 'We are in love and cannot be apart from each other.

'This is sad to us but our love, though 
we've had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of both our lives.
Please be happy for us.'

Lalinksy added: 'You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I'm so sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would've done it.

'Try not to be sad and don't blame yourself, nothing could be done.'

Lalinsky's distraught mother, Lisa Schwartz, wiped away the tears as she said how she felt betrayed by a man who was 'like a brother to me'.

She added that the pair, who had met at church, had never showed any signs they had feelings for each other. She said that Messer, who is from South Lyon, has one son and got a divorce last year.

'I trusted him,' Schwartz told ABC7. 'My whole family trusted him. My daughter trusted him. Bob was always 
like a brother to me.

'Emily doesn't have a dad, so she always looked up
to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They're both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.'

Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families

Heartbreak: Her mother Lisa Schwartz sobbed as she said she had trusted Messer, a family friend

Schwartz, who has six children and is 
recently married, said she had always appreciated the time Messer had spent with
her daughter because she had been so busy with the family.

'With me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with her, so he was like, "I'll take her to Ann Arbor, I'll take her to Botanical Gardens",' she recounted.

Lisa and her husband Neil reported her daughter missing on Sunday night and police are treating it as a missing person case.

So far they do not have any leads and have not issued an Amber Alert.

'We can work through this, we always do,' her mother pleaded. 'I love you. Just come home.'

Police
added that Messer drives a 1991 two-tone brown Ford truck and had 
recently told colleagues he wanted to travel to Oregon or Idaho. They 
appealed for anyone with any tips to come forward.

Quiet: Emily, whom her mother described as an introvert, has known Messer since she was a child

Plea: Lisa Schwartz and her husband Neil appealed for her daughter to return home to them

Schwartz suggested that they might have gone to a national park together as they both enjoy hiking.

'I think once he realizes the magnitude 
of what he has done, he might hurt himself, and I donâ€™t know where that 
would leave her,' she told WDIV.

Lalinsky is described as a white female, 5'5" and 130 lbs. She has long blonde hair and blue eyes.

Messer's brown Ford pick up truck has the license plate CNS2754.
