Stephan El Shaarawy helped himself to two goals as Real Madrid were comprehensively beaten by AC Milan in a mid-season friendly in Dubai on Tuesday evening.

Carlo Ancelotti's side entered the winter break on the back of a record 22 consecutive wins but Cristiano Ronaldo and Co were second best to a Milan side currently occupying seventh place in Serie A.

Jeremy Menez opened the scoring for Pippo Inzaghi's side before El Shaarawy doubled Milan's lead after half an hour. Ronaldo pulled a goal back for Real before half time but El Shaarway netted his second of the game just minutes after the restart.

So Real taste 'defeat' for the first time since December with their friendly loss against Milan. Carlo Ancelotti shouldn't be too concerned with his side's performance though as he experimented with his line-up. Expect Los Blancos to come out firing for their La Liga clash against Valencia on Sunday. For Milan, the result will be a boost for them as they look to kick-on in the second half of their season.From me, Luke Augustus - see you soon!

And that's it! The referee brings a close to the friendly. Gareth Bale twice comes closing to reducing the scoreline before the full-time but whistle but it ends 4-2 to Milan.

90min: There will be two minutes of added time...

89min: Real are pressing for a third but can't find a way throught the Milan defence.

84min: Benzema makes no mistake from the spot firing the shot into the top left-hand corner. Agazzi dives correctly but the power proves too much for him. Will there an unlikely comeback from the Spanish giants?

Real have a small glimmer of hope to get back into this match as Nacho is brought down by Niang inside the Milan penalty box. Benzema stands over the penalty...

81min: Understandably both sides are now going through the motions. Real are away at La Liga rivals Valencia on Sunday, while Milan host Sassoulo on Tuesday.

76min: An interesting change from the Italian side as 16-year-old Hachim Mastour is given a run out. Mastour has been widely tipped as the next Milan superstar so his cameo should prove interesting viewing...

73min: Game, set and match Milan. Substitutes Giampaolo Pazzini and M'Baye Niang combine as the latter crosses with his left-foot for the former to head home at the far post.

66min: Carvajal whips in a brilliant cross that Bale heads just over the bar.

In the build-up of that move, Milan's two-goal hero El Shaarawy falls to the floor in a heap. Originally it looks like a hamstring injury but it turns out to be cramp. The Italy international has been plagued by injuries over the last two years and is quickly substituted.

60min: Michael Agazzi has only just come on in place of Diego Alves but already he's into the thick of things - producing a fine stop at his near post to deny Bale.

56min: It seems it will only be a matter of time before Real score a second. Benzema is slipped through on goal but Diego Alves comes out quickly off his line to thwart him. Moments later Jese appeals for a penalty after going down under a challenge but the referee waves plays on.

53min: Oh dear, look away Karim Benzema. Jese weaves his way along the Milan 18-yard box before firing a low shot across goal that hits the post. The follow-up falls to Benzema from eight-yards out with an empty goal but he side-foots his shot over. Carlo Ancelotti's side should be 3-2 ahead but they're starting to crank up the gears.

49min: El Shaarawy came close to making it 3-1 moments prior to actually doing so with his second strike of the match. The Italy international pounces on another Real defensive mistake before side-footing from close-range to score.

Real get proceedings underway for the second half...

The reason why Real are arguably the best club team in world football at present is due to their strength in depth. Superstars Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale form two thirds of their infamous 'BBC' (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) frontline but started today's clash on the bench. The deadly duo are both warming up...

And breathe. This is meant to be a friendly but it hasn't been anything but so far. Both teams have created a lot of chances and are treating it like a Champions League encounter at times. 

45 mins: Bonaventura comes close to make it 3-1 to Milan but his curled shot goes just wide of the post. That marks the last real chance of the opening 45 mins as the referee bring a close to proceedings.

40min: Ronaldo's goal has sparked the game into life. Both sides are now pushing for it, with Milan in particular trying to press for their third goal in the match. The crowd here in Dubai are really getting into too.

35min: Who else would it but that man Cristiano Ronaldo. Real hit AC on the break with Ronaldo slipped through on goal. The iconic No 7 makes no mistake and curls the ball past Diego Alves. Game on.

31min: Could Real taste defeat for the first time in three months? Stephan El Shaarawy makes it two-nil to the Italian side, cutting in from the left flank before unleashing a low right-footed shot which beats Navas at his near post.

28min: Chance for Madrid to respond but after going past the keeper, Sami Khedira runs out of angle and can only turn a cut-back back into a sea of Milan defenders.

24min: It's a deserved lead but it's a nightmare goal for Madrid to concede. Nacho plays just about the worst backpass you are ever likely to see, enabling Jeremy Menez to intercept before rolling an easy finish under Iker Casillas.

19min: This is more like it from Madrid. The European champions are starting to show the form which has seen them win their last 22 games as they begin to boss the midfield.

14min: Madrid's main priority in this game will be to come out of it without any injuries and that objective hasn't started too well.

Raphael Varane took a knock trying to beat Bonaventura to a header, while Fabio Coentrao has also received treatment in this game.

12min: Milan are getting closer to an opening goal though as Giacomo Bonaventura just misses out on heading home Riccardo Montolivo's near post header.

9min: Filippo Inzaghi's team continue to control the game, not that the former Italy striker looks too pleased with that. Chances are still lacking but Madrid are clearly not playing to their full potential right now. Ronaldo can't get a touch.

6min: Still Milan look the more dangerous team, with Nigel de Jong in particular getting stuck in - he can't resist a battle after all.

The midfielder does well to steal the ball off Cristiano Ronaldo on the edge of the Milan box, before his low drive at the other end moments later is easily collected by Keylor Navas.

3min: Rather surprisingly, AC Milan have been on top in the opening few minutes and while they haven't created a chance in that period - the ball has been entirely in Madrid's half. Good start from the Italian side.

Starting XI: Diego Lopez, Bonera, Mexes, Zapata, Albertazzi, Montolivo, De Jong, Muntari, Bonaventura, Menez, El Shaarawy.

Subs: Agazzi, Abbiati, Pazzini, Rami, Essien, Poli, Niang, Saponara, Armero, Dias, Da Costa, Zaccardo, Mastour.

Casillas, Pacheco, Pepe, Kroos, Benzema, Rodriguez, Bale, Carvajal, Raul de Tomas, D. Llorente, M. Llorente

Navas, Arbeloa, Coentrao, Varane, Nacho, Illarra, Isco, Khedira, Jese, Ronaldo, Hernandez.

Then this will be right up your road. What better way to end the year than a clash between the Champions League's two most successful teams ever?

It may only be a friendly but it's Real Madrid vs AC Milan and we will cover all the action for you here as it happens.
