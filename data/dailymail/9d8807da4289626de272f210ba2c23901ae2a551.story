St John Ambulance have said lawyer Alan Blacker is not a member of their Order and they've reported him to the police

A lawyer accused by a judge of looking like a character from Harry Potter is being investigated over claims he pinned fake medals to his court robes.

Judge David Wynn Morgan tore into solicitor-advocate Alan Blacker for wearing a set of ceremonial St John Ambulance medals sewn onto his barrister's gown during a trial at Cardiff Crown Court.

But it emerged today that Blacker is not a member of the Order of St John and the ambulance charity has reported him to police.

Keith Dunn OBE, Chief Executive for St John in Wales, said: 'We would like to confirm that Lord Harley - Alan Blacker - is not a member of the Order of St John.

'His name does not appear on the roles of the Priory for Wales or England and he is therefore not a member of our Order.

'He is not entitled to say that he is a Knight of the Order of St John and the dignities that appertain to being a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem.

'We have asked the Chief Constable for South Wales Police to investigate this matter and St John will be taking legal action if necessary.'

Mr Blacker, 42, wore his medals on brightly coloured ribbons while representing a minibus driver accused of causing the death of a cyclist.

After the case, Judge David Wynn Morgan slammed legal advocate Mr Blacker, who it is said bears a striking resemblance to Harry Potter character, Hagrid.

Judge Morgan told him: 'If you want look like something out of Harry Potter you can forget coming to this court ever again.

'I have been practising in these courts since 1978 and I have never seen a barrister or solicitor appear before these courts wearing a medal or with badges sewn onto his gown.

'If you ever appear before this court again dressed as you are I shall exercise my right to decline to hear you.'

Barrister Mr Blacker goes by the full name of Dr The Right Honourable The Lord Harley of Counsel of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem.

Mr Blacker, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, explained he earned the title Lord Harley by inheriting an ancient Irish peerage from his father and was a fully qualified solicitor advocate allowed to wear the robes of a barrister.

Judge Morgan questioned who gave him permission to wear the medals and ribbons on his gown.

Mr Blacker told the judge 'Lord Chief Justice Thompson' had told him it would be 'appropriate' to do so.

But Judge Morgan replied: 'Since I started practicing in 1978 there has been no Lord Chief Justice of England or Wales by the name of Lord Thompson.'

Outside the court Mr Blacker said he pinned medals and ribbons to his gown to make himself appear more qualified in front of a jury.

He said: 'The medals are there to balance the playing field. My medals were awarded to me - they may be for voluntary medical service but they bear the face of the Queen. They are not some poxy swimming badge.'

He added: 'They are very discreet and are there for when I appear in superior courts - it has never been an issue before.'

Mr Blacker said he represented people who cannot afford representation and often received little or no payment for his services.

He added: 'My reputation is widely known. I come from Lancashire, I speak with a Lancashire accent and work with Lancashire folk - I am nothing special.'

Mr Blacker's client, minibus driver Andrzej Wojcicki, 45, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.

Polish-born Wojcicki was looking at photographs on his mobile phone when he collided with cyclist Owain James, 30, at Newbridge, South Wales.
