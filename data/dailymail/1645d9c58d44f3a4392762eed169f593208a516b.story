A Virginia community is searching for answers after six of its students have died in apparent suicides over the last three years.

Each of the students attended W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax.

County officials said the deaths are not directly connected and that the number of suicides in such a short period is rare, according to a detailed report by the Washington Post. The deaths have troubled parents and administrators since the students did not show typical risk factors and were involved in their communities. 

Emotional: W.T. Woodson High School students pause for a moment of reflection on Tuesday, March 18, 2014 at The Cav Strong Community Event in Fairfax, Virginia

Grief: W.T. Woodson High School students are seen here during the candlelight portion of the Cav Strong Community Event on March 18. Six Woodson students have died in apparent suicides over the last three years

Parents told the paper that they wonder if a 'high-pressure, high-achieving culture' at the school was a factor in the deaths.

Woodson High School is ranked 5th in Virginia and 116th nationally, according to U.S. News and World Report.

Both parents and students said they're also concerned over earning spots in Virginia's public higher education system.

The paper says the deaths have spurred students to offer yoga classes and train as mental health first responders. The Woodson website now prominently features mental health resources on its front page and reportedly has tried to hire more psychologists and social workers.

Heartbreaking: Nick Stuban, pictured, committed suicide in 2011. He was a football player for W.T. Woodson High School

Tragedy: Cameron Kilby, pictured, committed suicide in August 2012. He was a Boy Scout, church acolyte and cross-country runner

Devastating: Bryan Glenn, pictured, was a football player who dreamt of serving in the military. He went missing in October 2012 and his body was found a week later in a park close to W.T. Woodson High School

The string of apparent suicides began in January 2011 when 15-year-old sophomore Nick Stuban killed himself after being disciplined for buying synthetic marijuana, the paper reports.

Cameron Kilby, 15, committed suicide on August 4, 2012, just before his sophomore year. He was a Boy Scout, church acolyte and cross-country runner.

Senior Bryan Glenn, a football player who dreamt of serving in the military, went missing in October 2012. His body was found a week later in a park less than two miles from the high school.

Junior Ethan Griffith, 17, jumped off of a parking garage in April 2012.

Jack Chen, 15, died on February 26, 2014, when he was hit by a commuter train.

A junior-year student, unidentified by the Post, was found dead the next day.

Parents, students, and administrators are trying to understand the deaths at W.T. Woodson High School. Two students reportedly committed suicide in February 2014

Hope: W.T. Woodson High School students show Cavelier Spirit by creating a "w" formation at the Cav Strong Community Event on March 18

Parents interviewed by the paper expressed their confusion and grief over the deaths.

Jim Chen, Jack's father, said he believed his son's skin medication may have been a factor. The unidentified medicine may cause depression.

'There was something going on in his mind, but he didn’t give me any chance to do anything,' Chen said.

Chen's suicide note said he 'couldn't keep doing this' and directly referred to apparent pressures he felt at school.

'There is too much stress in my life from school and the environment it creates, expectations for sports, expectations from my friends and expectations from my family,' he wrote.

Gayle Griffith, Ethan's mother, said the school ignored signs of her son's depression. She found a paper written by Ethan before his death which included suicidal thoughts.

'If a kid says he’s thought about it or writes about it in a paper, they are supposed to call their team of counselors. But that never happened,' she said.

Rosella Glenn, Bryan's mother, criticized the school and said it doesn't have adequate mental health resources.

'How many more need to die before somebody wakes up and realizes there is a situation that warrants bringing in more resources to fight this problem?' Glenn told the Post. 'I’m tired of seeing flowers and signs around Woodson.'

Resources: the deaths have spurred students to offer stress-reducing yoga classes and train as mental health first responders

The school said teachers will review respond to suicide warning signs.

Fairfax County Board member Megan McLaughlin also told the paper that Woodson High School is talking to students about mental health. 

'We absolutely have a responsibility to examine this as closely as possible to understand why this has continued to happen in one particular high school at this rate,' McLaughlin said. 'It’s simply too high.'

Christine Moutier, chief medical officer for the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention, expressed concern over a possible suicide contagion among the student body.

'The thing we are always concerned about is the phenomenon of suicide contagion,' Moutier told the Post. 'Youths are more susceptible to contagion, and research has found that 2 to 5 percent of teen suicides had a possible role of contagion. It is a vast minority, but it doesn’t mean the phenomenon doesn’t exist.'

In March, Woodson High School reportedly hosted a two-day suicide prevention training program,  according to WJLA. At the time the station described reports of the school being a 'pressure-cooker of sorts when it comes to social and academic performance.'

On May 17, the school system is expected to host a countywide mental health event.
