Do you want to be the proud owner of Sir Paul McCartney's old front door, a pair of stuffed zebras with narwhal horns or a Viking broadsword?

Well, now you can - courtesy of Christie's auction of the world's maddest items you never knew you wanted.

Among them are a Swarovski crystal-encrusted dog skeleton with platinum teeth, a giant, taxidermy spider crab and an Italian marble throne.

Meet the 'zebracorn' - a stuffed zebra bizarrely topped off with an ornate plaster narwhal horn. A pair of them is expected to sell for £5,000 at Christie's Out of the Ordinary auction in September

This grotesque dog skeleton, encrusted with hundreds of thousands of Swarovski crystals and platinum teeth, is estimated to make £30,000

Britain's oldest auction house is holding the strangest sale in its 250-year history - for a set of lots too weird for normal auctions.  

The 'zebracorn' - a zebra head with a narwhal tusk horn - is expected to sell for a whopping £5,000.

The 1950s' door to Sir Paul McCartney's childhood home is set to fetch around £8,000, while you'll have to pay around £5,000 to get your hands on mission commentary transcripts from the doomed Apollo 13 rocket flight.

The door to Sir Paul McCartney's childhood home will attract Beatles fans, while the most expensive item up for sale is an 11th century Viking broadsword estimated to be worth around £120,000

A German suit of armour with a strangely decorated visor could be yours for £30,000

A bottle of sparkling wine signed by Damien Hirst - in traditionally wacky style - could reach £15,000, the same amount as an incredibly rare Mata Hari pinball table. 

These are some of the cheaper items up for sale. The lot with the highest estimate is an 11th century Viking broadsword, once owned by the Earl of Hereford.

The runic blade, which is set in a 13th century pommel, bears a Viking inscription thought to mean it never goes dull, and is estimated to be worth around £120,000.

This George V silver cigar box is modelled on Harrods and was given to Richard Woodman Burbidge as a prize in a wager he made with Gordon Selfridge in 1927. It is expected to make £100,000 at auction

A bottle of wine signed by Damien Hirst and a £15,000 Mata Hari pinball table - one of the rarest electro-mechanical games ever made - are among the 185 lots

This giant taxidermy spider crab is hoped to fetch £8,000

It might go well with a 16th century German suit of armour with a bizarrely decorated visor, expected to sell for around £30,000,or an 18th century George III leather sedan chair, estimated at £2,500.

Christie's 'Out of the Ordinary' auction was held for the first time last September, and returns on September 2 with nearly twice as many lots - 185 in total. 

Celia Harvey, head of sales said: 'We are very pleased to offer the opportunity to acquire something a little different from Christie's South Kensington.

'The auction features a wide range of objects many of which have never been seen at auction.

'This year we will also be offering a selection of works in an online-only auction so that collectors can participate from around the globe.

'We look forward to welcoming the public to the free extended pre-sale exhibition throughout this month.'
