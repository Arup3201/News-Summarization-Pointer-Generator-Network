A new survey into drug use in Britain has found that one in ten people have tried 'legal highs' - double the global average.

And Britain's drug users are increasingly going online to feed their habits rather than use street dealers, research has found.

The 2014 Global Drug Survey said buyers look online because they say the quality is better, there is more choice and it is more convenient.

Deals are made using hidden online drug marketplaces such as Silk Road, which was the largest online black market site in the world until it was shut down last year.

Marijuana is increasingly being bought online, the 214 Global Drugs Survey has found

The most likely drug to be bought online was cannabis, followed by MDMA, LSD and ketamine.

The 2014 Global Drug Survey questioned almost 80,000 drug users from 43 countries,  7,326 of them from the UK. It is the largest research of its kind.

It is an anonymous 
study that provides a rare look into the illegal drugs being used at any
 point in time and they way they are traded.

Because the study isn't random, it doesn't show the 
prevalence of certain drugs or habits but it can show, comparatively, which ones 
seem to be on the rise and how their users take them.

While most users still get their drugs from dealers, researchers found the UK has the highest percentage of people who had ever bought drugs over the internet.

Almost a quarter of UK respondents to the survey said they had bought drugs over the internet.

Silk Road provides anonymity to drug dealers and buyers 
using a sub-layer of the Internet unreachable by normal search engines 
known as Deepnet, the Invisible Web, the Undernet or the Hidden Web.

Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically 
generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search 
engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a 
specific search.

An Internet search is like dragging a net across the 
surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a 
majority is deep and therefore missed.

Just under 60 per cent of UK responders knew about Silk Road, and of these, 44 per cent had accessed the site.

Almost a quarter said they had bought drugs over the internet.

Dr Adam Winstock, a consultant addictions psychiatrist in London and director of the survey, said that the results suggested a new 
trend.

'The fact that 44 per cent of respondents who had bought drugs online said they'd done it for the first time recently says to me there is growing recruitment,' he told The Guardian.

'It is currently a minority way to get drugs, but it really mimics the growth in e-commerce â€“ we buy things online becuase it is convenient, cheap, and there is a better product range.'

He added that the survey also reveals that the UK, more than any other country, is a nation of hedonists.

Figures revealed 73.8 per cent of respondents had taken at least one illegal drug over the last 12 months. Alcohol was the most common drug taken, followed by tobacco and cannabis.
