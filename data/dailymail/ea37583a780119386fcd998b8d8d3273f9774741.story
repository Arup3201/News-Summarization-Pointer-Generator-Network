Workers in the U.S. are more likely to develop depression after losing their jobs than those in Europe.

A new study has revealed job loss is associated with depressive symptoms both sides of the Atlantic.

But the effects are much stronger in America - perhaps due to less generous benefits systems, it has been suggested.

U.S. workers suffer more depression after losing their jobs than European ones do, research suggests

The Harvard study discusses how the 'Great Recession' of 2008 caused significant job losses in both Europe and the U.S., with particularly strong consequences for older workers.

Among people aged 50 to 64, unemployment rates rose from 3.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent in the U.S., and from 5.4 per cent to 6.15 per cent in the EU.

The researchers speculate that iIncome loss may have particularly devastating consequences for the retirement plans of older workers.

Prior evidence has also suggested job loss among older workers is associated with poorer health, increased substance abuse, and increased depression risk, they add.

The study, led by Carlos Riumallo-Herl and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, is the first to compare how these associations differ across countries.

The researchers used data on 38,356 people from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) covering the years 2004 to 2010.

The findings could reflect the more generous benefits systems in Europe

Surveys were carried out via questionnaire face-to-face in Europe and over the phone in the U.S., and covered 13 European countries – including Spain, France and Italy - and the USA.

At each interview, individuals were classified into four broad categories – employed, unemployed and looking for work, retired, or disabled.

The reasons for job loss were also gathered - due to the worker's firm or plant closing down, due to redundancy, or job loss for another reason.

And the individuals’ levels of depression were also recorded.

The results showed overall job loss was associated with a 4.8 per cent increase in depression scores in the U.S., and a 3.4 per cent increase in Europe.

However, when job loss due to plant closure was looked at separately, depressive symptom scores increased by 28.2 per cent in the U.S. as compared to 7.5 per cent in Europe.

The role of wealth also differed across the two regions.

Dr Riumallo-Herl said: ‘In the USA, the impact of job loss is significantly stronger for those with little or no wealth than for wealthier individuals and the impact of job loss due to plant closure was stronger than in Europe.

‘In contrast, we observed significant but weaker effects of job loss on depressive symptoms in Europe, which were not modified by pre-existing levels of wealth.’

The researchers suggest the results could reflect the more generous benefits systems in Europe.

Job loss linked to 4.8% rise in depression in U.S., and 3.4% rise in Europe

@highlight

When job loss is due to plant closure depression increases 28% in the U.S.

@highlight

In this situation, depression scores increase by 7.5% in Europe

This could be because of more generous benefits systems in Europe
