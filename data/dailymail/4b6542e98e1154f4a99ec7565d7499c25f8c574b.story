Male nurse Victorino Chua, 47, has been dramatically rearrested on suspicion of murder by detectives investigating the Stepping Hill hospital poisonings

A male nurse was yesterday charged with three murders after detectives uncovered new evidence about a series of hospital poisonings.

Married father of two Victorino Chua, 48, was also accused of 31 other offences – including GBH and attempted poisoning – in connection with deaths at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester police said.

The decision to charge Chua, who emigrated to the UK from the Philippines more than a decade ago, follows a major review of the case spanning two and a half years.

Sources described yesterday’s arrest as ‘a significant development’ in the long-running inquiry. It is understood police have been liaising closely with the Crown Prosecution Service about the evidence against Chua for months.

In the summer of 2011, a woman nurse at Stepping Hill called Rebecca Leighton was arrested and charged in connection with the poisonings. She was sensationally exonerated after spending six weeks in custody for crimes she did not commit.

Since then, a new squad of detectives from Greater Manchester Police – which was greatly embarrassed over the bungled pursuit of Miss Leighton – has carried out painstaking analysis of medical samples, post mortem reports and work records.

It culminated in pint-sized Chua, first arrested on suspicion of murder and related offences in January 2012, being re-arrested in a dawn swoop at his home near Stockport, at 6.30am yesterday – three days before he was due to answer police bail.

Whitehall sources said the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his advisers have been briefed on issues relating to the Stepping Hill poisonings. Critics say there should be a public inquiry into the case.

‘A man has been arrested in connection with the investigation into the deliberate contamination of products and tampering of medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital,’ said Greater Manchester Police shortly before Chua was charged.

‘Today, a 48-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of three counts of murder, 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and offences of poisoning under Section 24 of the Offences Against the Person Act. He remains in police custody.’

The alleged poisoning offences relate to the alleged tampering of medical records and the contamination of intravenous medicines at the hospital. Eight patients who were poisoned by contaminated products later died.

They were Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, William Dickson, 82, Linda McDonagh, 60, John Beeley, 73, Beryl Hope, 70, and Mary Cartwright, 89. The deaths of Miss Arden, Mr Lancaster and Mr Weaver are being treated as murders.

A total of 22 people were believed to have been poisoned when products were contaminated at the hospital in the summer of 2011.

Staff at Stepping Hill raised the alarm after noticing ‘unexplained’ low blood sugar levels in patients. Police later found a number of saline drips had been contaminated.

Detectives have reviewed and analysed the hundreds of interactions those patients had with staff or visitors during their time at Stepping Hill.

The alleged tampering affected patients on wards A1, A2 and A3 – acute care wards of seriously  ill patients.

Miss Leighton, 30, from Heaviley, Stockport, spent six weeks in jail after being charged with causing criminal damage intending to endanger life, criminal damage being reckless as to whether life would be endangered, and theft of medicine.

She was released and the charges against her dropped in September 2011 when prosecutors said there was not enough evidence against her, but she was subsequently sacked for theft by  hospital bosses.

Until he was re-arrested yesterday, devout Roman Catholic Chua was due to answer police bail  on Monday. Chua, a registered nurse since 2003, had been barred from approaching any witnesses or attending any medical sites.
