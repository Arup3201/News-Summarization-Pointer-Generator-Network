Leaker: WikiLeaks staffer Sarah Harrison says the  FSB approached Snowden while he was stuck in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport for six weeks 

A close ally of Edward Snowden reportedly told filmmakers that Russia's intelligence agency sought to recruit the former NSA contractor, but he declined the offer.

WikiLeaks staffer Sarah Harrison said the Russian FSB intelligence security service approached Snowden while he was stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for six weeks in 2013, the Associated Press reported.

At the time, Snowden was unable to enter Russia or fly elsewhere because his passport had been canceled by U.S. authorities seeking to arrest him for leaking secret documents.

According to the AP, Harrison told German filmmakers in a documentary airing late Monday that the FSB asked only once, and he 'didn't give anything to the Russians at all.' The FSB did not respond to a request for comment.

Russia granted Snowden temporary asylum in August 2013.

However, WikiLeaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson issued a clarification Monday.

Speaking to Sputnik News, Hrafnsson said 'I talked to Sarah [Harrison] and she wants to reiterate that she simply said that we confirm that [Snowden] was approached by the Russian Security Service while at the airport. As he actually indeed confirmed himself in his testimony to the EU parliament in January last year.'

Hrafnsson also told the website that FSB at no time attempted to recruit Snowden.

Hrafnsson stated that 'She [Harrison] never used the word "to recruit" and neither did [Snowden].'

The news comes after Snowden praised Russia and called the country 'great' in a NOVA interview, a transcript of which was published online last week.

Snowden said in the interview 'It was funny because [Mike Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency] was talking about how I was—everybody in Russia is miserable. Russia is a terrible place. And I’m going to end up miserable and I’m going to be a drunk and I’m never going to do anything.

'I don’t drink. I’ve never been drunk in my life. And they talk about Russia like it’s the worst place on earth. Russia’s great.' 

According to The Washington Post, Hayden said he expected Snowden to 'end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: isolated, bored, lonely, depressed – and most of them ended up alcoholics.'
