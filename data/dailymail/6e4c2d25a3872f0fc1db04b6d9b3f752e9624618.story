Shame: Mostafa Ahmed Awwad, 35, of Yorktown, covers his face as he leaves the federal courthouse in Norfolk

A U.S. Navy civilian engineer has been indicted on charges after he tried to steal schematics of an aircraft carrier under construction and have them sent to Egypt. 

Mostafa Ahmed Awwad, 35, of Yorktown, Virginia, was arrested on two counts of attempted exportation of defense articles and technical data on Friday. 

He provided computer drawings downloaded from the Navy to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Egyptian intelligence officer.

Prosecutors said Awwad intended to steal technical data about the designs of the USS Gerald R. Ford in late October.

He was contacted by an undercover FBI agent speaking in Arabic in September and the pair met the next day at a park in Hampton.

At the meeting, Awwad said he intended to use his position of trust with the Navy to obtain military technology for use by the Egyptian government.

He met the agent for a second time in October at a hotel where Awwad described his plan to circumvent Navy computer security by installing software enabling him to copy documents without tripping a security alert.

Later, the undercover agent was given aircraft carrier drawings marked with warnings that foreign distribution could result in criminal prosecution. 

The designs were for the 'Ford' the lead ship in a new class of carriers which is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in 2016.

Awwad began working for the Navy last February in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard's nuclear engineering and planning department.

He indicated that he understood the computer drawings would be used in Egypt.

He also agreed to provide the agent with passport photos to produce a fake Egyptian passport so he could travel without alerting U.S. government officials.

The engineer also asked for $1,500 to buy a tiny camera to enable him to photograph restricted material around the shipyard, according to an affidavit.

On October 23, Awwad retrieved $3,000 in cash from a pre-arranged drop site along a secluded hiking trail and left behind a container with an external hard drive and two passport photos. 

The FBI later collected the container.

Awwad was observed at his Navy office on November 28 holding what appeared to be aircraft carrier design schematics, which he placed on the floor and photographed.

He is scheduled for a detention hearing on December 10, in federal court in Norfolk.

The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each count upon conviction.
