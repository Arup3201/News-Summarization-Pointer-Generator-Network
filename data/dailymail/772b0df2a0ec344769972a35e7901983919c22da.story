An American stuntman has become the first person in more than a century to cross the Niagara Falls on a tightrope.

Nik Wallenda, 33, was watched by an estimated one billion TV viewers and more than 125,000 sightseers at the famous gorge. He took 25 minutes to traverse the 1,800ft gap from Canada to the US on a 2 in-thick steel cable on Friday night.

The water crashed over the precipice at 65mph, 200ft below him, and he was buffeted by swirling clouds of spray. But ignoring the No  1 rule of tightrope-walking, he looked down as he walked, rather than straight ahead. To aid his balance, he held a 40ft pole, attached by a brace to his neck. He also wore a safety harness attached to the cable.

‘This is what dreams are made of,’ said Wallenda shortly after he stepped off from a platform on the American shore. ‘I hope what I just did inspires people to reach for the skies.’

American James Hardy, 21, made several crossings of the gorge in 1896, but it was further from the waterfall and not as dangerous as Wallenda’s walk.

Feat: Nik Wallenda walks across the Niagara Falls in an attempt to be the first man ever to complete the walk

Danger: Mr Wallenda was finely poised above the surging waterfall which has taken many casualties in the past

Relief: The daredevil punched the air when he made it to the other side after 25 minutes

Epic: Mr Wallenda described the view over the Falls, which he is the only person ever to have seen, as 'breathtaking'

Torrents: The skilled tightrope walker never broke his concentration, even when surrounded by the rush of thousands of gallons of water

Spray: The water coming off the Falls was just one of several weather phenomena which Mr Wallenda had to contend with

Scale: From afar, the walker is barely visible against the background of the mighty Niagara Falls

Breathtaking: The spectacle enjoyed by Mr Wallenda during his unique experience is unlike that granted to anyone else

Setting out: Mr Wallenda pictured just a couple of minutes after starting his walk, when he was still walking downhill into the 'valley' of the rope

Wallenda, whose next stunt will be an attempt to traverse the Grand Canyon, took steady, measured steps across the 
mist-fogged brink of the roaring falls.

The daring 
acrobat set off around 10.15 to whoops and cheers from the huge crowd at
the atmospheric event.

An estimated crowd of 125,000 people 
on the Canadian side and 4,000 on the American side watched. Along the 
way, he calmly prayed aloud.

Afterwards, he said he accomplished 
the feat through 'a lot of praying, that's for sure. But, you know, it's
all about the concentration, the focus, and the training.'

The seventh-generation member of the 
famed Flying Wallendas had long dreamed of pulling off the stunt, never 
before attempted.

After he made it to the Canadian side
of the falls, Mr Wallenda said that at one point in the middle of the 
stunt, he thought about his great-grandfather and the walks he had 
taken: 'That's what this is all about, paying tribute to my ancestors, 
and my hero, Karl Wallenda.'

Scenic: Those who made the journey to watch Mr Wallenda were awarded with a once-in-a-lifetime view

Nearly there: Mr Wallenda became visibly more cheerful, though tired, when he was in sight of his Canadian destination

Home stretch: Mr Wallenda showboats for the crowd as he reaches the final few yards of his amazing walk

Coming in: The acrobat was delighted to find an eager crowd waiting for him when he arrived in Canada

Departure: Crowds in New York state watch Mr Wallenda start his quest to cross the Falls, unsure if he would make it all the way

Packed: There was barely enough space for all those who wanted to watch the feat to do so

A festive crowd started to gather on 
both sides of the border on Friday afternoon, spreading blankets and 
setting up folding chairs under picture-perfect blue skies and 
summer-like temperatures.

'We're here on a lark. We're looking 
for an adventure,' said Carole Halls, who with her husband pulled their 
nine- and 11-year-old kids out of school early to stake out space on a 
grassy slope across from where Mr Wallenda finished his walk on the 
Canadian side.

Ms Halls, of Oakville, Ontario, was 
all in favor of the tether, Mr Wallenda's one safeguard, designed to 
keep him out of the water if he falls.

'I think we have enough gore on TV,' she said.

Waiting for him: The tightrope across Niagara Falls pictured ahead of Nik Wallenda's attempt to walk across it on Friday night

Daredevil: Mr Wallenda's feat will be unprecedented if he makes it all the way across the iconic waterfall

Crowd: Spectators assemble on the Canadian border to watch Mr Wallenda make his attempt

The first to cross the gorge: French acrobat and tightrope walker Charles Blondin was the first ever person to cross a section of Niagara Falls on a 1,000 foot long tightrope in 1859, but chose a calmer spot downstream

Length of wire: 1,800 feetWeight: 7 tonsDiameter: 2 inchesMaterial: SteelHow it's installed: Helicopter flew lighter tension wire across Niagara Gorge. That acts as guide for cable to be pulled by machines across the gorge.How it's secured: Bolts are sunk deep into bedrock, several hundred yards back from each shore.Estimated time for walk: 30-40 minutesWallenda footwear: Elkskin-soled shoes custom-made by his mother.Balance pole: 30 feet long; 40 poundsEstimated attendance: 125,000 in Canada; 4,000 on U.S. sideDirection: From the United States to CanadaWeather forecast for Friday night: Temperatures in the low 60s with winds out of the east at 10 mph or lessHeight of Horseshoe Falls: 170 feetHeight of cable above brink: 20 feetVolume of water: 600,000 gallons per second

A
C-shaped clamp trailed behind him on the walk, designed to allow 
free passage over the pendulum anchors. If he had slipped, he would dangle by his
waist about eight feet below the wire to wait for rescue.

ABC,
which televised the walk, insisted on it. Mr Wallenda said he only 
agreed because he was not willing to lose the chance and needed ABC's 
sponsorship to help offset some of the $1.3million cost of the 
spectacle.

Conditions were 
good leading up to the nationally televised stunt scheduled for Friday 
night. When he left terra firma about 10.15pm, the temperature was in 
the low 60s with winds under 10mph from the east, roughly at his back.

'I think it's a crazy idea,' said 
Maurice Wang, 59, he drove from Toronto to watch the walk from the 
Canadian shore. 'Someone has to be really committed. You can't just say,
"Oh, I want to try it." He's got my respect for that.'

On
the U.S. side of the falls, cars lined the road into Goat Island as 
people jockeyed for good spots to watch Mr Wallenda's 1,800-foot walk on
a two-inch wire through the mist rising from the falls.

For the 33-year-old father of three, the Niagara Falls walk was unlike anything he has ever done.

Because it was over water, the two-inch wire did not have the usual stabiliser cables to keep it from swinging. Pendulum anchors were designed to keep it from twisting under the elkskin-soled shoes designed by his mother.

The Wallendas trace their roots to 1780 Austria-Hungary, when ancestors traveled as a band of acrobats, aerialists, jugglers, animal trainers and trapeze artists.

In 1928, the family gave its inaugural performance at Madison Square Garden and earned a 15-minute standing ovation from an astounded audience, who marveled at them performing without a safety net.

And the clan has been touched by tragedy, notably in 1978 when patriarch Karl Wallenda, Nik's great-grandfather, fell to his death during a stunt in Puerto Rico.

About a dozen other tightrope artists have crossed the Niagara Gorge downstream, dating to Jean Francois Gravelet, aka The Great Blondin, in 1859. But no one has walked directly over the falls and authorities have not allowed any tightrope acts in the area since 1896.

It took Mr Wallenda two years to persuade U.S. and Canadian authorities to allow it and many civic leaders hoped to use the publicity to jumpstart the region's struggling economy, particularly on the U.S. side of the falls.
