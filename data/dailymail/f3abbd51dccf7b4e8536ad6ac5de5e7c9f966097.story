A 'miracle' drug will be provided for free to Australia's sickest cancer patients, left with no other options, through a special access program by drug manufacturer Merck Sharp and Dohme.

The drug, known as MK-3475, has a positive response in about 50 per cent of patients taking it to treat advanced melanoma - compared with between 10 and 20 per cent for the current most effective treatment, Yervoy.

The move comes partly due to a campaign spearheaded by Ron Walker, the former Lord Mayor of Melbourne and chairman of the Australian Grand Prix.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration approved a limited release of the drug last week, following pleas from patients, cancer doctors, support groups, Merck Sharp and Dohme, and Ron Walker.

Each month, a small number of patients with metastatic melanoma, that has spread and is unable to be removed through surgery, will be given access to the drug.

MK-3475 has been lauded as a wonder drug by doctors, shrinking tumours in over half the trial patients receiving high enough doses.

The drug, which is also known as PD-1, works by blocking the cancer's ability to camouflage itself, allowing T cells to attack the cancer.

'Believe me, it does work,' Mr Walker told 3AW's Neil Mitchell in 2013.

The prominent businessman also added that unlike a lot of cancer sufferers undergoing treatment, he was lucky enough not to have any side effects from MK-3475.

Professor Grant McArthur, of Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, said drugs such as this one are changing the way doctors are fighting cancer.

'Overall, there are over 1,000 patients a year in Australia still passing on from the ravages of advanced melanoma, and a significant proportion of those patients moving forward would be eligible for this type of treatment,' Professor McArthur told ABC Radio on Monday morning.

Last year, Ron Walker campaigned on behalf of Nick Auden, a Melbourne-born father who moved with his family to Denver, Colorado to pursue treatment for Stage 4 melanoma.

After qualifying for the clinical trial of PD-1, Mr Auden was ruled out due to a medical complication.

He died on November 22, 2013.

'The notable cases such as Nick, such as Ron, to be seen publically, to disclose the challenges they're going through, I think really helps the public debate about moving these treatments and getting them accessible to their patients as soon as possible,' Professor McArthur said.

Despite still being in clinical trials, results have been so positive that some advanced melanoma sufferers have been granted access prior to formal regulation.

Ron Walker was able to use his connections, such as Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Health Minister Peter Dutton, to assist doctors in pushing forward with a limited release.

Under the deal struck by Merck Sharpe and Dohme and the Therapeutic Goods Administation, a limited number of Australian patients will be granted access to the drug - prior to complete regulatory approval.

Metastatic melanoma patients are being advised to speak with their oncologists regarding the treatment.
