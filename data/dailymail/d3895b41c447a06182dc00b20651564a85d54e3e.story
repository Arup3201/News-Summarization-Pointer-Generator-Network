Tragedy: Branson Riley Carlisle suffered a fatal bite from a brown recluse last Sunday at home in Albertsville, Alabama

Three photographs taken by five-year-old Branson Riley Carlisle's mother chart the progress of the fatal spider bite that tragically ended his life the Sunday before Thanksgiving.

The first picture which reveals a noticeable swelling and redness on Branson's shoulder blade was taken by Jessica Carlisle just 15 minutes after he was bitten by the brown recluse.

The second photograph was taken just one hour later and reveals the bite has turned into a tender looking welt on the back of the Alberstville, Alabama, boy.

The third photograph was taken in hospital by Branson's mother nine hours after he was bitten and shows a rash and painful blotching of the skin.

Branson passed away suddenly from a cardiac arrest five hours later.

Jessica has made the difficult decision to release the images of her dead son in a bid to raise awareness among parents of the dangers of a brown recluse spider bite.

She wants them to know that the minute they suspect their child has been bitten to rush them to medical attention.

The distraught mother also wants her son's final wish to be granted - to give all his Christmas gifts away to children in Africa.

It was last Sunday that Branson was bitten at around 9am, wearing his new pajamas. 

His mother then took him to the doctors office where he started showing symptons.

He told Jessica he had been  and showed her the red mark on his shoulder blade.

'He said something had stung him,' said Jessica to AL.com. 'It was a brand new pajama top and this spider was in his shirt. I saw a welt on his back.'

Deterioration: The spider bite is pictured here nine hours after Branson told his mother and tragically, five hours before he passed away

Having been bitten herself by a brown recluse, Jessica knew that bites could turn serious,and decided to take Branson straight away to Marshall Medical Centers South in Boaz and got there within one hour. 

While there Branson began running a fever of 100 and doctors were concerned the spider's venom was 'going systemic' - which is a rare reaction to the brown recluse bite.

'They took it very seriously [at Marshall. They started him on antibiotics, steroids and Tylenol,' said Jessica to the Examiner.

'His vitals were all normal. He was laughing and playing and being a 5-year-old boy. The doctor said he was going to send him to Children's of Huntsville or Birmingham, whichever one was quicker, but he didn't seem to think it was going to get worse.

'It was just in case anything happened, he would have the best care.'

First off he was taken to by ambulance to Huntsville Hospital for Women & Children.

Memory: Jessica Carlisle watched helplessly as her son's condition went downhill during the day after he was bitten by the brown recluse spider

Culprit: This is the brown recluse spider that bit Branson and was killed and captured by his mother for the benefit of the doctors

Also known as the fiddleback spider, the violin spider or the brown fiddler, the brown recluse spider has venomous and potentially fatal bite.

They are usually brown or gray in colour and between six to 20 millimeters in length. They typically have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax,

These markings include a black line coming from the dorsel side that looks like a violin, resulting in the nickname 'fiddleback'.

The spiders often build their webs in dry, generally undisturbed locations, including sheds, closets, garages, cellars and other similar places.

In America, their range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through to southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, to southwestern Ohio.

In the southern states, they are native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky.

Brown recluse spiders have the ability to survive starvation and thirst, and the way in which they benefit from the regulated room temperatures of human habitations, make extermination of this species particularly challenging.

Jessica said the bite appeared to get worse there and became black and blue like he had been struck by a baseball.

His condition became too serious for those at Huntsville Hospital for Women & Children to handle so Branson was immediately transferred to another hospital -  Children's of Huntsville.

However, once there, Branson began to deteriorate. He developed head and stomach pains and the doctors decided to place him on oxygen and take him to the intensive care unit.

'He was talking in the elevator on the way to ICU, arguing with the doctor. The doctor wanted him to open his mouth and he said, 'No, I don't want to.' Just being a 5-year-old.' said Jessica.

Suddenly as Jessica was waiting outside the ICU at around 11.30pm she heard raised voices and the unmistakable sound of panic.

'Doors started flying open and people started coming running from everywhere. I've never seen so many doctors in one room,' said Jessica to the Examiner.

'The nurse came out in the hallway and sat down. They told me his heart had stopped. They shocked him.'

Wish: Branson wanted to give all his Christmas presents to children in Africa who have none and his mother wants anyone who can help to drop them off at Freelife Worship Center in Sardis, Alabama

The doctors told her that their son's blood was failing to clot and that his organs were bleeding internally.

'I was in the room when they shocked him for the 17th time, and I knew there was nothing else in this world that they could do for him. I told them it was time to stop,' said Jessica.

Stunned, Jessica buried her son on Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.

Trying to turn the tragedy into a triumph, Jessica has decided to fulfull her son's wish to give toys to children in Africa who have none.

'He wanted all the kids in Africa to have toys,' said Jessica to WHNT. 'I mean, he was going to give his own toys.'
