A Michigan hockey player has shared a gruesome image online of his bloody mouth after he took a puck to his face.

Mitch Callahan, a 22-year-old right wing for the Grand Rapids Griffins, uploaded the image to his Twitter account just minutes after he was struck in front of the net by a teammate's shot.

Callahan, who was already missing his two top front teeth, lost 10 teeth and suffered a broken jaw and split lip in the incident on Wednesday night. On Thursday, he underwent surgery.

He was helped off the ice with a towel over his mouth as his teammates began looking for his teeth and, about 15 minutes later, he shared the photo with the message: 'Ouch.'

After posting the photo, he was taken to the hospital and the Detroit Red Wings prospect was undergoing surgery on Thursday, Wings general manager Ken Holland told the Detroit Free Press.

Callahan was hit by a slap shot from teammate Ryan Sproul, who feels guilty about the incident, according to a former Griffins player, Luke Glendening.

'He 
feels terrible,' Glendening said. 'He didn't want to talk about it. He 
feels bad. I guess Cally got cross-checked and he was falling as Sproul 
shot it, but he still feels terrible.'

The image that Callahan shared has been re-tweeted 6,000 times and favorited nearly 5,000 times.

But Coach Jeff Blashill said he heard about the grisly tweet and told Mlive he did not approve of it.

'Shame on me for not having a more direct statement on that,' Blashill said. 'But I just think we have to be real careful what we put out on social media.'

Callahan is the the Grand Rapids Griffins' second-top goalscorer. The team went on to beat Iowa 6-1 in the game on Wednesday night.
