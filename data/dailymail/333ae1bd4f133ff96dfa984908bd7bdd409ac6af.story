Queen Letizia looked the picture of elegance on Spain's national day today.

She wore a fitted dark teal dress in tweed fabric with matching earrings, shoes and a clutch bag. Her hair was blow dried into a straight style and she wore dark eye makeup with a soft lip.

The Spanish Queen, 42, held her daughters' hands as the trio arrived for a military parade marking Spain's National Day in Madrid.

Princess Leonor, 8, and Princess Sofia, 7, wore angelic white dresses with ornate print in blue and red, with ruffles. They had their blonde hair braided at the side. 

Husband and father, King Felipe VI, 46, joined the girls dressed in smart, traditional military attire complete with sash, hat and gloves. He had left his well-groomed salt and pepper stubble unshaven.

A goat, the mascot of La Legion, an elite unit of the Spanish Army, marched in front of the tribune where the Royal family sat and watched. Princess Leonor was amused.

At one point during the patriotic event King Felipe VI and Sofia seem oblivious as Leonor pointed something in the sky out to mother, Queen Letizia. 

Later, the Royal couple held an official reception at the Royal Palaces where they met with foreign officials and diplomats.

Yesterday, the newly crowned King of Spain was joined by his father former King Juan Carlos during an air show of the Spanish Air Force Base in Madrid.

Spain's national day is held annually every October 12.

It is a national holiday that commemorates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first arrival in the Americas, a day also celebrated in other countries. Since 2000, it has also been Spain's so-called Day Of The Armed Forces.

To commemorate it, there is a parade performed by the military, which also typically features a display by the Spanish Air Force's aerobatics team.

It is chaired by the King and usually held in Madrid. 

An array of officials including foreign diplomats and members of the autonomous governments are invited to attend.
