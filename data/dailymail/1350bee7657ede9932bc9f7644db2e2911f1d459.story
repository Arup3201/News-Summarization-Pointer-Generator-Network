Seoul has created special women-only parking spots to make the South Korea capital more female-friendly - not, apparently, as a statement on the gender's driving ability.

The city is spending around $100 million on initiatives including the new parking spaces that are dubbed 'she-spots' and come marked with bright pink outlines and a skirted woman logo.

The move has already sparked accusations of sexism, like officials in the German town of Tribeg were met with in 2012 when they introduced a similar program.

Triberg Mayor, Gallus Strobel, said he was accused of 'male pig-headedness' because the female spots were better lit and wider while the male versions were flanked by concrete pillars and could only be reversed into.

Of the Korean parking plan, one Twitter user wrote: 'Really? What century is it in ?'

However, others welcomed the news.

Motoring.com.au reported the pink parking spots come as part of a charm offensive that includes 7000 new female-only toilets around the city and the resurfacing of pedestrian walkways with a spongy material, which makes it easier to walk in heels.

As in Tribeg, Seoul's special parking spots are wider and longer than regular ones and also better lit and closer to shopping center infrastructure, such as elevators and escalators.

It's not clear whether male drivers who park in the spots will incur a fine.

The Assistant Mayor for Women and Family Affairs Cho Eun-hee told the Korea Times newspaper: 'It is like adding a female touch to a universal design and make things more comfortable for women.'

China, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia, Austria and Italy also have women-only parking spots.

Australia doesn't have spots reserved for women but they do have 'family' car parking spots in shopping malls for parents with infants.
