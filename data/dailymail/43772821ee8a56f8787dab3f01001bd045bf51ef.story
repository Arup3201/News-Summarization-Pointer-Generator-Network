The Conservatives have surged ahead of Labour in a new opinion poll, as voters backed David Cameron in his battle with Brussels.

The Tories are backed by 33 per cent of voters, according to the latest Ashcroft survey, two points more than Ed Miliband's party on 31 per cent.

It comes after a separate poll showed Mr Cameron is the most intelligent political leader in Britain - and UKIP leader Nigel Farage is the  weirdest and most stupid.

The Conservatives have jumped to five points ahead of Labour in the latest Lord Ashcroft poll. 1,006 adults were  interviewed by telephone between 27–29 June 2014

David Cameron was all smiles in the Commons this afternoon after Tory MPs read out the results of the Ashcroft poll showing the Tories ahead of Labour

The survey will send shockwaves through the Labour party, which has become embroiled in a fresh bout of infighting over its ability to win the next election.

The Ashcroft poll, carried out from Friday to Sunday, suggests Mr Cameron has been boosted by his hardline stance against arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker becoming President of the European Commission.

The Prime Minister was defeated by all but one of the EU's 28 leaders on Friday.

In the Commons today, Mr Miliband suffered 'utter humiliation'. He told MPs: 'You returned to Britain on Friday having failed.

'Not some mild small failure, but an appalling failure of relationship building, winning support and delivering for Britain.'

But Mr Cameron defended his strategy of continuing to make his case, despite being in a minority.

'Facing the prospect of being outvoted, some might have swallowed their misgivings and gone with the flow but I believe it was important to push the principle and our deep misgivings about this issue right to the end.

'I at least wanted to put Britain's opposition to this decision firmly on the record.'

The approach appears to have resonated with voters, putting the Tories two points ahead in the Ashcroft poll, with the Lib Dems on 9 per cent and UKIP down two points on 15 per cent.

Despite the Conservatives being ahead in the voting intention, 32 per cent want a Labour government against 25 per cent favouring a Tory government in 2015

Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory donor and now pollster, said: 'The boost in the Tory share may well be largely thanks to Mr Juncker: the poll was taken between Friday afternoon and Sunday evening, when political news was dominated by David Cameron’s stance against the appointment of the new European Commission president. 

'We will see in the coming weeks whether this support can be sustained.'

Mr Cameron was last ahead in a poll in May, when two polls showed the first Tory lead for two years.

However, more voters would prefer to see a Labour government after the 2015 election.

Almost a third (32 per cent) would most like to see a Labour government, compared to 25 per cent backing a Conservative administration.

A further 9 per cent back a Tory-Lib Dem coalition, while just 8 per cent support a Labour-Lib Dem power-sharing deal. 

However, just 80 per cent of Labour supporters wanted to see Mr Miliband governing alone and only 77 per cent of Tory voters favoured a Conservative-only government.

Surprisingly, 3 per cent of Labour voters want to see a Tory government, while one per cent of Tories prefer a Labour government. 

The Ashcroft survey emerged after a poll of the 40 most marginal seats in the country revealed what voters think of our political leaders.  

Mr Cameron is seen by four out of 10 voters as smarter than Mr Miliband,  Clegg and Mr Farage. He is also considered by far the least 'weird'.

Pollsters ComRes interviewed 1,008 adults living in the 40 most marginal constituencies where the Conservatives and Labour shared first and second place at the last General Election in 2010

The interviews were carried out online between June 18 and 25. Of the 40 constituencies, 25 currently have a Conservative MP and 15 a Labour MP

However, the ComRes survey suggested Mr Cameron is still on course to lose the next election, putting Labour ahead by five points in the constituencies which will decide May's crunch poll.

Labour are backed by 36 per cent of the public in the 40 most marginal Labour-Tory constituencies - ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent. 

The Lib Dems sit on just seven per cent, 10 points behind UKIP on 17 per cent.

Some two thirds of the public in the marginal seats say they will decide who to vote for based on which party has the best policies on the issues important to them. 

Just one in seven say the party with the leader who will make the best Prime Minister will get their vote.

ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins said the Tories needed to convince voters they were on their side to stand a chance at the next election.

He said: 'Despite talk of the polls narrowing in favour of the Conservatives, this poll shows that in the seats which really matter Labour remain stubbornly in front.

'To have any prospect of staying in power David Cameron has to persuade voters that he and his Party understand the needs and concerns of ordinary people. He certainly cannot afford weeks like the one he has just had.'

Mr Cameron is also seen as the 'most competent' political leader - and the one most likely 'to get things done'. 

The Prime Minister even outscores Mr Miliband when voters are asked which leader has the 'right policies for Britain'.

But Mr Cameron remains hampered by his privileged background. Half of voters in the 40 crunch constituency battles rate the Prime Minister as 'the most out of touch with ordinary people'. 

And despite voters considering Mr Farage the 'weirdest' political leader, he is also seen as the least out of touch. Around a third of voters meanwhile see the  Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg as out of touch.
