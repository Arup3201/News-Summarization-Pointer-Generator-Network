Romance is alive: Aurora, Illinois, 29-year-old, Tyler Morrick, is so enamored with his fiancee, Rachel Maschmeier, 27, he spent four hours in the middle of the night this week spelling out his undying admiration for his longtime love in the snow, pictured

He started at 1 a.m. and finished as the sun came up, he told the Beacon News.

Morrick guessed the entire message is about 150 feet wide by 250 feet long.

'When I finally laid down to make the snow angel for the question mark, I could barely even move,' he said.

'I didn't have thick enough socks on and I was in an incredible amount of pain, but all I was thinking about was our relationship and I wasn't going to stop until it was finished.'

The next day, Morrick unveiled the surprise, after organizing a neighbor to watch the couple's 18-month-old daughter, Kaleigh.

That's dedication: Morrick, pictured, started at 1 a.m. and finished as the sun came up. 'When I finally laid down to make the snow angel for the question mark, I could barely even move,' he said

'She had no clue what was going on. She thought I crashed the car or something,' he said.

'I told her "I snuck out of the house without you knowing and I did something that I'll never regret for the rest of my life."'

When Maschmeier saw what he'd done she started crying, Morrick told the newspaper.

'I just always want to surprise her. I want to be out of the ordinary, do something that she'll never forget, and do something that money can't pay for, most importantly,' he said. 'She's my angel sent from above.'

Morrick said he hadn't planned the love dedication in advance. In fact, he said he was about to fall asleep when he 'randomly got up, got dressed and went outside.'

'I had zero preparation. I had no thought of how long it was going to take or how I was going to do it,' he said.

But he was certainly thrilled with how it turned out.

The couple met five years ago through a friend and later worked together at Potter's Place in Naperville.

They have been engaged for two and a half years but are in no rush to set a date for the wedding.

'We're [basically] married. I already call her my wife,' he said.
