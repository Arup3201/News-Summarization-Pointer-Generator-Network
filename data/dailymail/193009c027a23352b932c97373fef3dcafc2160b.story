Roy Keane has re-opened his feud with former Manchester City defender Alf-Inge Haaland.

The Manchester United legend notoriously fouled Haaland in 2001, which his first autobiography claimed was an act of vengence after Haaland had wrongly claimed Keane was playacting after injuring his cruciate ligament when tackling Haaland, then of Leeds, in 1997.

Now Keane's new book - published this week, reveals he does not feel sorry over the incident.

'There are things I regret in my life and he's not one of them,' said Keane.

Keane was banned for five matches and fined £150,000 after an FA inquiry into the initial quotes, but reveals in his latest words he was hurt by those charges.

In his first autobiography, Keane wrote: 'I'd waited long enough. I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.'

Later Keane said: 'The charges hurt me - the idea I'd bragged... in hope of selling extra books.'

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'
