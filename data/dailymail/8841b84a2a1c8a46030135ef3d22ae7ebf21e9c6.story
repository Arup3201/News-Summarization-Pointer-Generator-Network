Protesters were arrested as they took part in a demonstration about paying cleaners the living wage at a flagship John Lewis store.

Police were called after a group of chanting protesters descended on the Oxford Street store in London, amid dozens of customers doing their Christmas shopping on one of the busiest weekends of the year. 

At least one protester was bundled to the floor as officers tried to contain demonstrators and get them to leave the busy shop.

Protesters were arrested in John Lewis in Oxford Street in London on Saturday after they staged a protest calling for the firm to pay cleaners the living wage and give them the same benefits as other John Lewis staff

The protest was part of a campaign by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to protest against cleaners at the John Lewis partnership, who are employed by an external contractor and are not paid the the living wage.

They also want cleaners to be included in the partnership's annual bonus scheme and given the same rights as other workers in the building. 

However the partnership said they believed in fair pay but could not enforce pay levels well abover market rates on the contractors they use.  

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said a number of protesters were arrested for 'breach of the peace' on Saturday afternoon and taken to a police station in central London. However officers are yet to confirm how many in total were held. 

Police were called to the store in Oxford Street at about 2.30pm on Saturday after protesters gathered on the fifth floor and in the basement gift section.

One shopper, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's bad enough shopping in Oxford Street two Saturdays before Christmas without a load of idiots coming between you and the kitchenware section.

A number of protesters were arrested during the demonstration at the department store in Oxford Street 

'It was absolutely packed in there and so when they started shouting I think the staff panicked a bit and then before we knew it there a load of police officers descended on the place.

'They were trying to get them to leave but the protesters were having none of it.

'A couple of them got bundled up the escalators by the police and at least one was on the floor.

'You could just see his legs sticking out from behind a board games display.

'I felt a bit sorry for the staff as they looked really stressed out.' 

At least one campaigner was bundled to the floor on Saturday as police tried to contain the protesters 

Customers said they saw about 10 police officers at the shop on Saturday afternoon after the protest started 

People in London posted messages on Twitter about the protest at John Lewis, which took place on Saturday

A member of staff, who also did not want to be named, said: 'They are protesting about the cleaners.

'Apparently the cleaners are employed by an outside company and don’t get the living wage and aren’t partners like the rest of us.

'The bosses are obviously panicking about it. There are loads of senior people here, the head of branch is down here, so it must be pretty serious.

'It is probably the most exciting thing that has ever happened at John Lewis.'

John Lewis Partnership is owned by a trust on behalf of all its employees, who are known as partners. 

It runs the John Lewis department stores as well as Waitrose supermarkets. 

Partners have a say in how the company is run, as well as a share of the annual profits through a bonus scheme. 

It is one of the largest private companies in the UK. 

This year partners received a bonus of 15 per cent of their annual salary- equivalent to almost eight weeks' pay. 

John Lewis Partnership employs around 90,000 people.

Cleaners are employed by an external contractor but IWGB Union wants them to receive the same benefits as John Lewis partnership staff.  

Some demonstrators were seen hanging banners over the railings which said: 'Justice for the Cleaners' and going down the escalators blowing horns.  

Campaigners were seen holding boards which said: 'John Lewis your customers say pay your cleaners the living wage.' 

Customers at the store posted messages on Twitter on Saturday. Jo described the demonstration as 'very loud' and added: Not sure they are winning over many fans, my son is distraught.' 

A spokeswoman for the John Lewis Partnership said they shared the living wage campaign’s objectives but achieved this through different means. 

She said: 'Our policy is to pay the market rate for a job and as much above that as can be justified by performance.

'In relation to cleaning, with a few historical exceptions, the majority of cleaners who work in our branches are, as with almost every organisation, contractors. Most work for more than one employer, often on the same day. Like all retailers, we work with many different contractors of various kinds throughout our supply chain. We could not operate effectively if all our contractors were partners.

'We take our responsibilities to all our suppliers and contractors very seriously. We expect them to uphold good employment standards. However, we don’t believe it’s right for us to insist our suppliers or managing agents adopt pay policies that are different to our own by setting base pay levels well above the market rate.'

IWGB has targeted a number of large firms in recent weeks, calling for cleaners to be paid the living wage, calculated according to the general cost of living. They say workers should be paid at least £7.85 an hour or £9.15 an hour in London.

More than 124,000 people have already signed an online petition calling for the board at John Lewis to pay cleaners the minimum wage and include them in the company's annual bonus scheme.
