An animal lover has been hailed a hero after he wrestled a suffocating cat from the squeeze of a boa constrictor with his bare hands.

The unidentified man was alerted to the distressing scene after he heard heart-wrenching mews of pain coming from undergrowth in Costa Rica.

With no thought for his own safety, he leapt into action, plunging his hand into the tangle of scales and fur in a bid to prize the puss free.

Bad mews: After tussling with the carnivorous reptile for almost a minute the man finally managed to detach the snake, whose fangs had already locked around the cat's hind leg

But as this video shows, the six-foot snake wasn't going to give up his prey willingly.

He then slowly unwound the coils to liberate the dazed feline, which acknowledged the favour with a glance before limping off into the bushes.

Andres Gonzalez, who filmed the entire rescue on his mobile phone, said he saw the lucky pet already looking in better spirits later that day despite the ordeal.

Boa constrictors are powerful snakes and stealthy hunters, even though they travel at only 1mph, and mostly live in tropical climates throughout most of Central and South America.

The boa's hunting technique is generally to ambush prey and the bigger it gets, the bigger its preferred prey becomes.

It may start out eating mice and other small rodents. But as it grows, it can handle big iguanas and wild pigs and, as this video shows, cats.

The snakes are not venomous. Instead, boas grab and hold onto their prey with small, hooked teeth, wrap around the victim and squeeze them to death before swallowing it whole, digesting it with strong stomach acids.

Boas generally weigh more than 45kg and grow to about 12ft. The longest boa constrictor ever found was 18ft. In the wild, they can live up to 30 years and are sometimes hunted them for their skins.
