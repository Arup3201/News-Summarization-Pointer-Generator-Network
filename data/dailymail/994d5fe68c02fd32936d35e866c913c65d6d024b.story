A Georgia police sergeant has been accused of pulling a gun on a teen customer ahead of him in a McDonald's drive-thru line after becoming enraged over the wait for food.

Detective Sgt Scott Biumi, 48, of the DeKalb County Police Department, was arrested this week and charged with aggravated assault - a felony - after the incident at a McDonald's in Cummings.

Forsyth County Sheriff's spokesman Courtney Spriggs said Biumi pointed a gun at 18-year-old Ryan Mash, who was in front of him on the drive-thru line waiting for his food at about 10:30pm on April 9.

Suspect: Scott Biumi has been charged with aggravated assault in the incident

Surveillance footage from inside the 
restaurant shows Biumi step between the man's car and the drive-thru 
window and point a gun into the car as he leaned into the driver's 
side window.

Mr Mash told 11Alive: '[He] was yelling, "Stop holding up the drive thru line… You don’t know who you’re messing with and there’s some crazy people out there."

'And that’s when he pulled the gun on me and kept on yelling at me for about 30 more seconds. I was scared. I was very scared.'

He added that he didn't know that his assailant was a police officer.

Mr Mash, who also works at the McDonald's, claimed he did not do or say anything to set off the irate man, who quickly drove off - without his food.

But not before Mr Mash's friends in the car with him took down the license plate number. A police investigation led to Biumi - a 20-year-veteran of the DeKalb County Police Department.

Spriggs says Biumi was booked into the Forsyth County jail on Wednesday, and released on $22,000 bond..

It is unclear if he has an attorney and Spriggs says a court date is scheduled for May 23.

He has been suspended from the department with pay while the police department conducts an investigation, 11Alive reported.
