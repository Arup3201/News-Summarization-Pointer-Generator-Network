A student rugby club has been banned from playing after team members dressed up as paedophile Jimmy Savile and his victims on a night out.

The bad taste fancy-dress event was organised by members of St Cuthbert’s Society Men’s Rugby Club at Durham University.

St Cuthbert’s - one of the 
university’s most successful college sides - has been forbidden from 
playing for the rest of the term after first-year players dressed up as 
young girls, second years wore Savile outfits, and third and fourth 
years came as police officers or Panorama journalists.

On top of the inappropriate theme, it
is alleged one person stripped off, another tried to steal a dartboard 
from a rival college bar and more players set off a fire alarm.

Members have also been barred from at least two college bars.

A Durham University spokesman said: 'The university has been made aware of an incident.

'We take such matters very seriously. The students’ college has investigated the incident and disciplinary action is being taken.'

It is understood organisers of the event, on October 25, have been ordered to carry out unpaid work and £50 fines have been imposed on players.

Prank: Members of the society thought it would be funny to lampoon Savile and his hundreds of victims but university bosses have taken a dim view

St Cuthbert’s College celebrates its 125th anniversary next year and counts BBC news presenter Kate Silverton among its alumni.

A member of the team, who did not want to be named, said he was ‘disillusioned’ with the process.

'Playing bans are unprecedented,' he said.

'Other colleges have had numerous disciplinary hearings, while the university rugby club, DURFC, have been involved in several serious incidents that have not resulted in playing bans.

'Would DURFC ever be banned from playing? Absolutely not.'

The college rugby team has one of the most successful records in Durham,  winning the Men’s Premiership five times in the last seven years.

However, on the Men’s Premier League website, the team has already been dropped to the bottom of the table and a loss of 40-0 will be recorded for every game until their ban has ended.
