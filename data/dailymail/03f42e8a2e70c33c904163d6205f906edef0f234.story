West Brom needed a first half penalty from Graham Dorrans to defeat Sacramento on Tuesday as new signing Graig Gardner was sent off for a second bookable offence in the pre-season friendly.

Victor Anichebe was brought down in the 13th minute by Sacremento's Nemanja Vukovic before Dorrans stepped up to put Alan Irvine's side ahead.

It was far from plain sailing for the Baggies though as goalkeeper Boaz Myhill had to be at his best to make a number of brilliant saves as Sacramento pushed for an equaliser.

Former Sunderland midfielder Gardner had a pre-season debut to forget after being sent off for a second bookable offence in the 82nd minute of the game at Bonney Field.

Gardner picked up his second yellow of the game for a foul on Sacramento midfielder Gilberto.

West Brom's first game in the USA also saw debuts for summer signings Chris Baird and Sebastien Pocognoli.

Ben Foster joined up with the team last Wednesday after his World Cup duties with England and missed the game.

Injured players Gareth McAuley, Jolean Lescott, James Morrison, Chris Brunt and Craig Dawson also had to watch from the stands.

The Baggies will come up against their American opponents once again on Friday.
