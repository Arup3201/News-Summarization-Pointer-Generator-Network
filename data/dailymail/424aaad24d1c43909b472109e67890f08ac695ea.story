Retiring: Bob Hoskins was given the diagnosis in the autumn. Announcing his retirement the star's agent said he planned to spent time with his family

Actor Bob Hoskins has put his £895,000 country retreat up for sale after announcing he is retiring from showbusiness following his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease.

Hoskins, 69, revealed his battle with the brain disorder earlier this week - several months after his diagnosis.

It has now emerged the four-bedroom home he has shared with his second wife Linda for more than 10 years is on the market.

The property in Chiddingly, East Sussex, boasts a swimming pool, tennis courts and a paddock set in 13 acres.

Hoskins has said he retired so he could spend more time with his family before his condition deteriorated further.

The announcement brings to an end a silver screen career which spanned four decades and included Hollywood hits such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

His most recent appearance was in Snow White and the Huntsman, released this year and starring Kristen Stewart.

A statement released by his agent said: 'Bob Hoskins wishes to announce that he will be retiring from acting, following his diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease last autumn.

'He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career.

'Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time'

Symptoms of Parkinson’s include tremors, muscle stiffness, difficulty with movement and a gradual slowing down of the body. Facial expression and balance can also be affected.

Hoskins is perhaps best known for his role in 1988 Hollywood hit Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

Daiga Heisters, of support and 
research charity Parkinson’s UK, said: 'We are sorry to learn that Bob 
Hoskins has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s is a 
progressive condition that affects everybody differently, and can change
on a daily, or even hourly, basis.

'Many
people can live a full and active life with their diagnosis of 
Parkinson’s. However, it does affect some people quickly and severely.'

Actor Michael J Fox is one of the most
well-known sufferers of the disease, which he has battled for more than
20 years. He was diagnosed at the age of 30, but did not make the news 
public for another seven years.

He is now 51, and his Michael J Fox Foundation is the largest contributor of private funding to research into the condition.

Another high-profile sufferer is Muhammad Ali, who was diagnosed at the age of 42 in 1984.

The former champion boxer, now 70, has cut an increasingly frail figure in recent years.

The majority of cases of Parkinson’s 
disease appear for no known reason, but experts believe the repeated 
blows to the head may have contributed to the onset of the disease in 
his case.

Back To The Future star Michael J Fox also has the disease as well as former heavyweight world champion boxer Muhammad Ali

The 69-year-old from Suffolk has played a wide range of roles including starring as a minder in 1986 film Mona Lisa opposite Cathy Tyson

Hoskins began his film career in the 
1970s and found fame playing Harold Shand in the iconic 1980 gangster 
film The Long Good Friday alongside Helen Mirren.

An Oscar nomination for best actor and
further critical acclaim followed his lead role in another British 
film, Mona Lisa, in 1986.

He went on to play Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit  in 1988, and Smee in both Hook (1991) and Neverland (2011).

In the 1980s and 1990s he was also famous for his adverts for BT, and his ‘It’s good to talk’ catchphrase became well-known.

He has four children and has lived in 
East Sussex with second wife Linda Banwell for more than a decade. Asked
in May if acting was still a passion, Hoskins replied: ‘Acting is a 
lark but I’m trying to work less. They say: "Bob I know you’re trying to
retire but we’ve got a little swan song here which is the business..." 
and I get talked into it.

'The more you don’t want to work, the 
more work you get. I want to be at home with the wife but she doesn’t 
want me to retire, she wants me out of the house.'
