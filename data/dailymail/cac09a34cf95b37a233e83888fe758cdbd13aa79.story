Thousands of birds filled the skies today when unusually high tides temporarily submerged their natural habitat.

The wading birds, which find their food in the wetlands of The Wash, near Snettisham, Norfolk, took to the air when advancing waters covered their usual stomping ground.

Spectacular flights, which feature oystercatchers, plover, godwits and geese, only occur a few times a year when tides in the area are exceptionally high.

Birds including knots, oystercatchers, Sanderlings, Black and Bar Tailed Godwits and Plover took to the sky in search of food

Birdwatchers look on at the natural phenomenon, which takes place only a few times per year in very high tides

Faced with the encroaching waters, these waders took to the sky

The images of the majestic formations were captured above the RSPB's nature reserve in Snettisham, a protected and vital habitat which is home to over 300,000 birds.

The stunning photographs show the birds, separated into their different species, peeling off into the sky in search of their next meal.

Appreciative birdwatchers looked on as the mass of birds took to the skies above the reserve, home to many species which are difficult to encounter elsewhere.

But, though the images may look like a mass migration, with the birds quitting the area for good, their relocation was short-lived.

Only hours after the high tide had 
reached its peak, the wetlands which provide the resident birds with all
their food were visible once more and the resident species of the 
Snettisham reserve could return home.

The
reserve is situated alongside The Wash, one of the country's most 
important estuaries for bird life, which contains 10 per cent of the 
nation's salt marsh.

It is fed by the rivers Steeping, 
Witham, Welland, Nene and Great Ouse which drain into The Wash from the 
surrounding counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire.

These waders found their wetlands wetter than usual after a high tide covered much of their food

After the tides, the birds could return to these wetlands, which sustain thousands of birds
