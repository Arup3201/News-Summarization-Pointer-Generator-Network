Manchester City were afforded time to unwind on Sunday night after sweeping aside Southampton as the squad supported James Milner and his charity foundation.

The Premier League champions beat Ronald Koeman's Saints 3-0 on the south coast before boarding a plane back up to Manchester.

Milner's foundation raises funds and awareness to benefit national charities including the NSPCC, Help For Heroes and Leukaemia Research, as well as supporting regional initiatives.

And the majority of Manuel Pellegrini's squad - complete with wives and girlfriends - turned out for the midfielder's Vegas-themed night at EventCity in Trafford Park, an evening which included performances by Kaiser Chiefs and Alexandra Burke.

Yaya Youre, Gael Clichy and Frank Lampard scored the goals at St Mary's, with the latter telling the Manchester Evening News: 'Tonight is for a great cause and of course it's nice to come off the back of an important win today and for us all to be here for James.

'It was exactly the result we wanted and means we can celebrate tonight - although in a very sensible way as we've got another important game on Wednesday.'

Lampard scored City's second goal during their 3-0 win away at high-flying Southampton earlier in the day

Sky Sports News presenter Hayley McQueen was also in attendance at the charity bash

City travel to Sunderland on Wednesday as they attempt to close the gap with Chelsea further.

The typically professional Milner has all eyes on the trip to Wearside.

'It was a bit of a dash from Southampton but we're here ultimately and it was a good result which is obviously great and sets up the evening nicely.

'It was a great result, but we've got a game on Wednesday so we've got one eye on that, and we just hope everyone has a good night.'
