The pregnant wife of Olympic ski champion Bode Miller has shared a new photo of her growing baby bump. 

Morgan Beck, who is now six months along with her first child posted a side-on selfie on Instagram with the words: '6 months, 28 lbs and an amazing appetite. This isn't so bad.'

The professional volleyball player and model, 27, added in the comments that she was 'impressed' by her weight gain.

Three months to go! Bode Miller's wife Morgan Beck has shared a selfie of her growing baby bump

She also shared that she and her husband have decided not to find out the sex of the baby before it is born.

'It's going to be a surprise!' she wrote. 'It's so hard for me not knowing though.'

The couple, who married in 2012, confirmed in December that they were expecting a baby. It will be a first child for Beck and a third for Miller, 37, who has a six-year-old daughter with Chanel Johnson, and a son, two, with ex-partner Sarah McKenna.

The announcement came just weeks after Beck suggested that McKenna became pregnant with Miller's son by 'taking a condom out of the trash'.

In an anonymous November post on TheBump.com, she wrote: 'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom.'

But when readers became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed. 

McKenna and Miller were involved in litigation over custody of their young son since his birth, with the case only being settled at the end of last year, though details have not been made public.

Even more strange is the fact that the boy's legal name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, though Miller calls him Nathaniel to honor his brother who died of a seizure at the age of 29 in 2013.

McKenna dismissed Beck's claims about how she got pregnant, saying: 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida. 

'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.'

Miller and Beck met in 2012 just months after he began dating McKenna, and were married in October 2012.

Early in 2013, Beck suffered a miscarriage, just one month before McKenna gave birth.
