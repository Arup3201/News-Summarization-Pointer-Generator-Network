The head of the BBC handed a £600,000 contract to a friend, it emerged last night.

Tony Hall has appointed Suzanne Heywood to lead a two-month review into making the corporation a ‘simpler place to work’.

He worked with Lady Heywood, who is married to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, at the Royal Opera House before he joined the BBC as director-general.

Her study with global management consultants McKinsey is not expected to cut the BBC’s headcount or save money.

Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said the links between the pair raised very serious questions as to how McKinsey beat its rivals to the contract.

Threatening to call Lord Hall before the committee’s next BBC hearing in September, the senior Labour MP said: ‘If these questions are not adequately answered we will have to investigate them ourselves.

‘It’s a lot of money. If you are going to pay consultants you have to go through the appropriate mechanisms and not use your friends.

‘With all eyes on the BBC at the moment I can’t understand why they don’t appreciate that everything has to be visibly above board.’

Conor Burns, a Tory MP on the culture, media and sport committee, has written to Lord Hall asking him to publish all the documents relating to the McKinsey contract.

‘Tony Hall was brought in as director-general with a clear mandate to put the days of murky relationships and mutual back scratching at the BBC behind them,’ he said.

‘It is vital if his credibility is to be upheld that the BBC now urgently publish the tender documents relating to the awarding of this contract, so the licence fee payer can see beyond doubt that this contract was awarded on merit and not on the basis of personal favours.’

He added: ‘It seems extraordinary when you have so many highly paid executives that you need to bring in highly paid consultants to do a job they should be able to do themselves.

‘It is a very poor use of licence fee payers’ money. The only way it will be good value for money is if the consultants recommend firing one of the BBC’s senior managers. One of their salaries could pay for the whole exercise.’

A partner in New York-based McKinsey & Company, Lady Heywood is also a director of the Royal Opera House in London, where Lord Hall was chief executive from 2001 until his switch to the BBC in April. The BBC insists McKinsey was hired ‘after a competitive process’.

Announcing the plan, Lord Hall said: ‘I want, as far as I can, to turn more of the organisation toward the programmes and our services, and less on the other things a big organisation like this does.

‘We all know that working in matrices is a very complex way of operating. We can make it simpler for people to take responsibility for what they do.

‘I hope that by this time next year, I will be standing before staff and licence fee payers with a simpler organisation, where responsibilities are much clearer.’

McKinsey was on a shortlist of four management consultancy firms before Lord Hall made the final decision to award it the contract.

Earlier this year, he was criticised for appointing another former colleague to a top post at the BBC on a £395,000 salary.  Anne Bulford, who was Channel 4’s chief operating officer, was handed the role of managing director of finance and operations without the job being advertised. Miss Bulford spent three years with the Royal Opera House as director of finance and business affairs before joining Channel 4 in 2005.

Lord Hall knows her from their time together at the Royal Opera and also from his time as deputy chairman at Channel 4. When he appointed her, he sent an email to staff saying she was a ‘direct appointment rather than an advertised one’ because he believed her talent and experience ‘make her the best person for this role’.

Her appointment came shortly after Lord Hall announced he had hired former Labour culture secretary James Purnell as strategy and digital chief on £295,000 a year.

Like Miss Bulford he was appointed without the role being advertised.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s no doubt that the BBC needs to simplify its labyrinthine structures, but licence fee payers will be dismayed that yet again McKinsey is raking in a massive sum in consultancy fees.

‘Given the vast sums that the BBC top brass are paid, you could be forgiven for thinking that they ought to be best placed to take a lead in sorting out their own organisation.’ At a public accounts committee hearing into the BBC severance payments scandal this month, MPs said the corporation’s financial management was akin to ‘corporate fraud and cronyism’.

In 2011, the BBC was criticised for spending more than £8million on management consultants in just one year.

Last year, former director-general George Entwistle hired accountancy firm Deloitte to help slash the number of managers at the corporation.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘McKinsey & Company were appointed because they were the best organisation to do the job.

‘A number of companies took part in a competitive tender process and were assessed and shortlisted before the director-general was involved.

‘The final decision was then unanimously taken by a committee comprising representatives from the BBC’s strategy and finance divisions and the director-general.’
