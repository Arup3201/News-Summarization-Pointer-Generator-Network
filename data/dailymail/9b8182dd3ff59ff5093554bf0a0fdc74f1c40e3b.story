George Osborne suffered an embarrassing setback yesterday after the sale of the 4G mobile phone network delivered £1.2 billion less than he predicted just two months ago.

In a highly controversial move in December the Chancellor plugged a black hole in the public finances by confidently pencilling in a £3.5 billion profit from the sale of the 4G network, which will bring faster mobile broadband services to Britain.

The move helped ensure that Mr Osborne narrowly met his self-imposed rules on public borrowing when he delivered his autumn statement on the economy in December.

4G licences awarded: All the major mobile phone companies - EE, Hutchison 3G, O2 parent Telefonica and Vodafone - sucessfully bid for a slice of the spectrum, with Vodafone picking up the biggest piece of the pie

But the telecoms watchdog Ofcom 
announced yesterday that the sale had raised just £2.3 billion - just 
two-thirds of the amount predicted by Mr Osborne, and barely a tenth of 
the £22.5 billion raised by the auction of the 3G network in the year 
2000.

The Treasury last night insisted it 
was content with the sale, pointing out that the £1.2 billion shortfall 
was only a tiny fraction of total tax receipts. Sources said Mr Osborne 
will announce in next month’s budget how the hole in the public finances
will be filled.

But Labour seized on the development as another blow for Mr Osborne’s economic strategy.

Already on the market: EE was the second highest bidder paying £588.9million for its slice of the airwaves. The network already has access to 4G and was the first to it to UK mobile users last year

Shadow Treasury chief secretary 
Rachel Reeves said: ‘It shows how foolish and short-termist the 
Chancellor was to bank this cash in the autumn statement to make his 
borrowing figures look less bad.

‘He couldn’t bring himself to admit 
that borrowing was up so far this year but his trickery has now badly 
backfired.’ The 4G sale is also embarrassing for the independent Office 
for Budget Responsibility, which made the £3.5 billion forecast, and 
which has repeatedly got its growth predictions wrong since it was set 
up in 2010.

Former Tory Cabinet minister John 
Redwood said it was unfair to blame the Chancellor, adding: ‘He has made
an independent budget office who are meant to know about these things, 
and I am afraid they have been consistently wrong.

‘They have consistently overestimated
the growth in the economy and they have consistently overestimated the 
revenues.’ Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the completion of the 4G 
auction six months early would produce a ‘significant economic boost’ 
for the country.

Auction facts: Bidders in the 4G sale competed to buy airwaves in two separate bands - the higher frequency 2.6 GHz and lower frequency 800 MHz - with 28 lots up for grabs

‘The benefits will be seen in the UK 
from the summer onwards as mobile operators deliver competitive high 
speed mobile broadband services,’ she said.

Ofcom said that by 2030 demand for 
the mobile data could be 80 times higher than today and it was planning 
for a further spectrum for possible future 5G mobile services.

4G services should make it much 
quicker to surf the web on mobiles, giving speeds close to home 
broadband services and allowing consumers to stream high-quality video, 
watch live TV and download large files.

For the typical user, download speeds
of initial 4G networks will be at least five to seven times faster than
those for existing 3G networks.

Faster than ever before: How 4G compares to 3G

This means a music album that takes 20 minutes to download on a 3G phone will take just over three minutes on 4G.

Meanwhile, Britain’s coveted AAA 
credit rating could come under yet more pressure today as the Chancellor
struggles to get the country’s ballooning debts back under control.

The government borrowed £106.5billion
in the first nine months of the financial year, which runs from April 
2012 to the end of March 2013.

That is £7.2billion or 7.3 per cent 
more than at the same stage of the previous year.The Office for National
Statistics will today reveal how the exchequer fared in January - with 
many analysts fearing the worst.

January is a crucial month for the 
public finances and has recorded a surplus in every year but one since 
the monthly borrowing records began in 1993.

It is usually boosted by the payment 
of corporation tax, capital gains tax and self-assessment income tax but
with the economy struggling to recovery revenues are dwindling.

The surge in borrowing has fuelled 
fears that Britain will be stripped of its gold-plated credit rating in a
crushing setback for George Osborne.

Martin Beck, an economist at Capital 
Economics, said: ‘If the figures for January are bad, the chance of a 
downgrade will increase, although the rating agencies would probably 
wait to hear what the Chancellor announced in the Budget before doing 
anything.’
