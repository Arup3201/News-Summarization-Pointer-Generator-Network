Prudish: Censors were worried teenagers would become confused about sex and reproduction if they watched the classic horror film Alien (pictured), it has emerged

Censors were worried teenagers would become confused about sex and reproduction if they watched classic horror film Alien, it has emerged.

Archived files reveal the film could have been given an 'AA' rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) - making it suitable for cinema-goers aged at least 14.

Instead the 1979 film was stamped with an adults-only 'X' rating - which is today's 18 certificate - mainly because of just one scene.

When hapless Kane - played by John Hurt - examines a pulsating egg on an eerie planet, censors squirmed in their seats.

It is one of the scariest moments in the 117-minute film but was bizarrely deemed to present a 'perverse view of the reproductive function'.

There are no sex scenes or nudity in Alien and the 30-year-old document suggests censors were not concerned by the violence, gore or the escalating fear factor.

It was the image of the egg - which leads to Kane's shocking demise during a meal in an infamous scene - that was thought by the BBFC to be too disturbing for sexually inexperienced viewers.

Alien was directed by Oscar-winner Ridley Scott and starred Sigourney Weaver as heroine Ripley, fighting for survival against a murderous shape-shifting creature. It has a similar premise to the Steven Spielberg blockbuster Jaws which was released four years before Scott's space thriller.

But the killer shark film was deemed suitable for children and given an AA rating by the BBFC because child psychologists warned it would affect adults more.

Scary: Kane - played by John Hurt - looked at the pulsating egg in a scene which gave the film an 'X' certificate

Too much? The image of the egg - which leads to Kane's shocking demise during a meal - was thought to be too disturbing for sexually inexperienced viewers by British Board of Film Classification censors

The judgement on the BBFC archives reads: 'I feel uneasy about passing for 14-year-olds a film which uses sexual imagery in a horror context.

'The images are not always explicit but run like a dark undercurrent throughout suggesting a powerful, threatening, unnamed force.

'Occasionally the image is explicit as 
when the leathery egg opens up to reveal a glistening pulsating membrane 
which erupts into a squid-like creature.'

The
censor claims his decision was based on a similar scene from the 1978 
remake of the B-movie Invasion Of The Body Snatchers which was also 
given an adult-only rating.

The BBFC official concludes: 'I don't want to flash ideas like this to teenagers who might not have come to terms with the normal sexual functions.

'The early teens are a troublesome time with physical changes making terrific demands on emotional stability.

'I don't myself want to pass for this age-group a film which might be disturbing in a non-specific way to a significant proportion of them.'

The film was released uncut in 1979 and was a hit with audiences who squirmed and screamed at the tightly wound story.

Weaver starred with Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, Yaphet Kotto and Ian Holm as the doomed crew of the Nostromo.

There have been six films since the original was released and the Alien - designed by surrealist H.R. Giger - is one of Hollywood's greatest monsters.

Dr David Sorfa, head of film studies at Liverpool John Moores University, said the decision was based on a 'crude psychology' at the BBFC during the time.

Dr Sorfa said: 'The BBFC would make judgements in the 1969s and 1970s based on crude psychology of a perception of an ideal viewer.

'Censors would state their blanket judgements based on what they thought a viewer of a certain age would think.

'Today, there is a mechanism in place which essentially means certain imagery cannot be included.'
