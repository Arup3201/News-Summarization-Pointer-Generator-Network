A nine-year-old girl has walked in to a police station and turned in her parents for growing and selling marijuana.

The child calmly entered the station in Barnesville, Minnesota on June 6 and told officers that her parents were growing marijuana plants almost as tall as her in the crawl space beneath their home.

She said she had decided to seek help because the smell of the pot smoke made her feel sick, and she also worried about her dog's health because her parents would blow smoke into its mouth.

'She was a 
very brave, very smart, very articulate little girl,' officer Ryan 
Beattie told the Minnesota Star Tribune. 'It was almost like interviewing an adult.

'She
 appeared to have intelligence far above a normal little girlâ€¦ She gave some pretty specific information about things, like types of 
drug paraphernalia, that no young person ought to have knowledge about.'

Authorities carried out a search on the home and all of their discoveries - including seven marijuana plants and drug paraphernalia - were exactly where the girl said they would be.

They also allegedly found a substance that tested positive for meth at the scene, the Forum News Service reported.

Charges are still pending the results of lab analysis of the plants and chemicals found in the home.

The girl told authorities that her 
parents smoked marijuana in the house every day and often had people 
over to buy it from them.

The Forum News Service reported that the parents admitted to using marijuana.

The mother claimed that it helped her symptoms of multiple sclerosis and that they sold the drug to help make ends meet.

The officers also checked two pit bulls found at the house and the animals appeared to be well. There was no evidence apart from the girl's statement that the parents had given the animals marijuana, but there is still a possibility they could face animal abuse charges.

The girl is currently staying with her grandparents.

She had previously been taken into protective custody by Child Protection Services when the family lived in Cass County, North Dakota after her parents used marijuana in front of her.
