The script in Lewis Hamilton’s head prior to qualifying surely placed him on pole position, his esteem restored, on the testing ground of true racers at Spa-Francorchamps.

But in the slipping, sliding wet of this Saturday afternoon it was his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg wearing the broad smile of the fastest man. Hamilton, who was two-tenths of a second behind after struggling with a brake problem, was gloomy in his immediate press dealings.

He will start today’s Belgian Grand Prix from second on the grid – a handy place to be, according to history. Only six of the last 14 pole-sitters have converted their advantage into victory. Hamilton himself was overtaken at the start when on pole here last year.

Those facts are comforts for Hamilton, but it must still have hurt like hell to see Rosberg dominate him through the Ardennes hills, of all places. Yes, Rosberg is clever and thoughtful, a percentage player, but he is not meant to be Hamilton’s equal, let alone better, over a flying lap on a proper track like this – at 4.3 miles the longest in Formula One and home to such legendary corners as Blanchimont, Pouhon and Eau Rouge.

Nor is this a one off. Rosberg has now taken seven poles this season compared to Hamilton’s four. Some of the Briton’s disappointments were the result of ill-luck – notably, a fireball at Hungary last time out and brake failure a week earlier in Germany.

Despite Mercedes being exceptionally fast, he has not been on pole since the Spanish Grand Prix in mid-May.

He complained afterwards of a ‘glazed’ front left brake destabilising the car. ‘This is a circuit where you have to have confidence in the brakes,’ said Hamilton. ‘You could see when I was going straight on as the left brake wasn’t working for some reason. I don’t know why.

‘It went into glazing. When it glazes it is very hard to recover. You have to put the brake balance forward. It’s not that easy to clear it.’

It takes a good rub to fix the problem. That will be done overnight, meaning his brakes should work perfectly when the lights go out today.

‘I am not disappointed,’ said Hamilton, contrarily given his miserable body language and flat tone. But remembering how Vettel breezed past him on the straight last season, he added: ‘Second place is the best place to start here so I feel quite blessed.’

Hamilton is right not to think his chances of victory are over, given the Houdini acts he has performed on a number of recent Sundays from way down the field. As Rosberg said: ‘In the end I was really feeling comfortable and able to push, but it is only qualifying, so there is still a long race to go.

‘This is one of the most special tracks of the year, so to be in front is great.’

Edged out: It means the Brit will have it all to do at Spa on Sunday

The conditions were typical of Spa, a place for which the word ‘capricious’ could have been invented. Rain, sun, cloud, cold, warmth all blew in and out as the afternoon progressed. About 40 minutes before qualifying started the heaviest of the rain started, trapping team principals in the Mercedes motorhome, where they had met for private talks.

Marussia team principal John Booth was the first to brave the conditions, without an umbrella. He’s from Yorkshire and has seen worse. Others cowered in the doorway.

The track was still wet when the cars started, and rain fell again just after the first session had finished. By then, Hamilton had delivered one tetchy exchange over the radio. Urged to keep pushing – what else would he be doing? – he snapped back: ‘Please don’t speak to me on my lap.’

He only had to push against one man, in fact, such was the total dominance of the Silver Arrows: Sebastian Vettel, of Red Bull, and Fernando Alonso, of Ferrari, were third and fourth fastest yet more than two seconds behind Rosberg.

The other Brits had disappointing days. Jenson Button, so often a master in tricky conditions, was only 10th quickest, three places behind his McLaren team-mate Kevin Magnussen, while Max Chilton was 19th, more than a second a half behind the other Marussia of Jules Bianchi.

As for tomorrow’s race, the two Mercedes men will be allowed to race free of team orders. That is the commitment made to them after the confusion of the Hungarian Grand Prix four weeks ago, when Hamilton was asked to let Rosberg through but did not (there were extenuating circumstances).

Toto Wolff, Mercedes’ executive director, admitted the situation had needed ‘mediating, management, caressing and hard words’.

Should Hamilton lose out today, and slip further than 11 points behind Rosberg, there may well need for more of the same.
