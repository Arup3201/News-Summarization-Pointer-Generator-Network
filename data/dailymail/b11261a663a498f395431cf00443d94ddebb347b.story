Trying to work out your true feelings can sometimes be tricky business.

But now a Japanese lingerie company has created a concept bra, which it claims is be able to sense when a woman is in love.

Ravijour has engineered a concept bra that only undoes when ‘true love’ is detected using a built-in heart monitor and works with a smartphone app.

Japanese lingerie firm Ravijour has engineered a concept bra that only undoes when 'true love' is detected using a built-in heart monitor and works with a smartphone app

The product designer explained that an built-in sensor reads the woman's heart rate and sends it to an app via Bluetooth for analysis.

The app calculates the True Love Rate based on changes in heart rate over time.

When the true love rate exceeds a certain value, the bra hook is unlocked automatically.

The firm said the device is ‘a revolutionary bra that knows how women feel’.

The bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made, but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and a light that glows pink if the wearer is in love with a person nearby.

In a promotional video, the sensor monitors the smart bra wearer’s heart rate and transmits the data in realtime to an iPhone app using a Bluetooth connection.

An app seemingly processes the data – measuring heart rate elevation using a specially built algorithm as well as pre-set data - and only when a woman’s heart rate is suitably elevated and she is in love does the bra catch open, Geekologie reported.

While some would-be wearers might worry that any excitement might cause their underwear to ping off, the creators of the bra say that the catch will only be released when a woman is in love so that her Adrenal Medulla (part of the adrenal gland) secretes the hormone Catecholamine, which increases her heart rate.

The app calculates the 'true love rate,' (illustrated) according to the firm based on the data gleaned from the sensor on the bra, which will only open when a woman is in love so that her Adrenal Medulla (part of the adrenal gland) secretes the hormone Catecholamine, which increases her heart rate

The change is detected by the sensor, transmitted to the iPhone app and the bra unhooks, according to the company.

The sex expert in Ravijour’s video said: ‘Until now the bra was a piece of clothing to remove, but now it is an instrument to test true love.

‘I believe this bra will become a friend of women around the world.'

While the bra is designed to ward off creeps that try and unhook women’s underwear, according to the video, some people have questioned how the wearer might be released from the smart bra is she is not in love, or indeed if she does not feel she needs to be in love to get close to a man.
