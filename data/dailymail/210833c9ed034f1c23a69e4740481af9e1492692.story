Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will carefully avoid the media during his trip to the United Kingdom, on the heels of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's disastrous London swing a week ago.

He is scheduled to have a private meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday, but unlike Christie he will not take questions from the media while he's overseas.

Daily Mail Online asked his press secretary, Laurel Patrick, about interview opportunities and press conferences; she said neither would occur.

'Unfortunately, the Governor's schedule is extremely tight,' Patrick said, 'so we will not be able to accommodate (you).'

NO QUESTIONS: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is preparing a presidential run, but won't speak to journalists in London during a trade mission there

NO IMMUNITY: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had a few rough days in the UK last week after he started a national freak-out over childhood vaccines

'This is an official trip and the purpose of the trade mission is to promote foreign direct investment in Wisconsin, so it is vital that we keep the Governor's planned schedule.'

She said before Walker left that the journey would be 'a business trip, not a photo op.'

Walker is on an official state government trade mission until Friday, traveling with a group of Wisconsin government and business officials. But the trip will also give Walker a crucial chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016.

Christie's stock took a nose dive in the UK when he started a national furor over childhood immunizations after he was asked whether parents should have their children vaccinated.

The news story quickly gathered momentum, with other potential presidential candidates being asked whether they believed – as Christie suggested – that parents should be allowed to opt out.

'Parents need to have some measure of choice,' he said. 'So that's the balance that the government has to decide.'

Christie ended up canceling his final UK press conferences rather than endure more questions. 

A Senate panel held a hearing on Tuesday about the vaccine controversy. 

Walker will also deliver a speech at the prestigious Chatham House think tank on Wednesday about the global economy. 

His London trip is the third trade mission he has conducted since he took office in 2011, following visits to China and Japan. 

He has also said he is planning to visit Israel this year.

PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER? Walker is carefully establishing his foreign policy bona fides, knowing that governors are usually thought of only in terms of domestic policy

'Governors running for president need to show they have developed some foreign policy expertise since their jobs keep them at home most of the time,' Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told CBS News on Monday.

'Voters know governors understand domestic issues, but half a president's job is coping with the complexities of global crises,' he said.

'Candidates can't be caught flat-footed on the trail and in debates when international topics are raised. Getting briefed by experts is one thing, seeing leaders abroad is quite another – and then the candidates can sprinkle their comments with first-hand experiences.'

Other potential GOP presidential hopefuls have paid recent visits to London.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was there in January as part of a 10-day trade mission across Europe. He made news by pointing out that there are Muslim-dominated 'no-go zones' in England where police don't keep law and order.

Then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio went last year.

Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is the Democrats' front-runner, had a London stop during her book tour in the summer of 2014.  

The United Kingdom is Wisconsin's sixth largest export market; the state sends nearly $700 million worth of products to Great Britain each year. 

Wisconsin imported about $290 million in goods from the UK in 2013.
