Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has committed his long-term future to the north London outfit despite being continually linked with Ligue 1 outfit Paris Saint-Germain.

Lloris, who joined the north London outfit in August 2012, has established himself as one of the most consistent shot stoppers in the Premier League since making the switch from Lyon to Tottenham.

The 27-year-old has put pen to paper on a new five-year contract which ends talk of a move back to his homeland.

News of his desire to stay at White Hart Lane will provide a major boost to Tottenham's new head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

Lloris said on signing a new deal to stay at Tottenham: 'I spoke with the Chairman and I know the Club is as ambitious as ever.

'It’s very important to feel at home at a club and for my family to feel well. I enjoy a great relationship with the Club and the fans.

'The arrival of Mauricio Pochettino is important as well. I have a good feeling with him. He is also ambitious.

'Everything is clear in my head and if I’ve signed a new contract it’s because I trust the Club and I’m sure we will progress in a positive way.

'Last season wasn’t the season we all hoped for but we were still able to finish sixth in the league. We know where we have to improve, the Club also knows and there is a feeling and a confident connection between the Club and the players.'

Lloris, who captained the French national team to the quarter-finals of the World Cup, is now expected to take a short break before linking back up with Tottenham for their pre-season tour of America.
