An American real estate agent has calculated that the fictional value of Hogwarts is $204,102,000.

David Cross, who writes novelty real estate evaluations for Movodo.com, came to his conclusion by looking at the school's estimated location, the price per square foot of comparable homes in the hypothetical area, and the approximate size of the building.

While Mr Cross came up
 with the final sum, he also enlisted the help of die-hard Harry Potter fans 
to determine the factors that led to his calculation.

Cost of a castle: A writer for American real estate website Movodo.com calculated the fictional value of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at $204,102,000

Mr Cross had much of his work cut out for him by fans of the book series who had already attempted to figure out what the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry would be like if it were real.

One such enthusiast created a blog to establish the school's approximate location in the United Kingdom by looking at certain clues from the novels.

The writer calculated that the Hogwarts Express travels north at a speed of around 65mph, and it passes the towns of Norfolk and Peebles - a small town on the border of England and Scotland - on its way.

Using these factors - as well as the amount of sunlight on the day of Harry's trip to the school - the fan concluded that the most likely location of Hogwarts is in Scotland's Galloway Hills.

Taking this assumption to be fact, Mr Cross set about finding comparable homes in the Galloway area to determine the average price per square foot.

While no other buildings in Galloway are quite as grand as Hogwarts, by looking at five large homes in the area Mr Cross was able to determine that the average cost per square foot was $493.

The third and final step proved to be the most difficult - ascertaining the dimensions of Hogwarts in square feet.

Setting: Mr Cross based his calculations on the assumption that the most likely location of Hogwarts is in the Galloway Hills of Scotland

Probable location: This assumption takes into account the estimated speed of the Hogwarts Express, the towns it passes on the way to Hogwarts, and the amount of sunlight on the day of Harry's first trip to the school

At first Mr Cross looked at a model of the school, which was constructed on a 1:24 scale.

He deduced from the model that the magical boarding school sits on 27.7 acres, and by multiplying this by the average cost per acre, he found that it would be worth $22,675,000.

But Mr Cross ultimately decided that 
this price was too low, and so he set about finding a better - and more 
creative - way of determining the castle's actual square footage.

'Some of you might find this excessive, Hogwarts is the cream of the crop when it comes to wizarding schools'

He finally decided to multiply the number of students at Hogwarts by the ideal amount of space each student should have in a classroom.

After all, he wrote, '[Hogwarts is] a school filled with educators who care about how students learn. No one can tell me that Professor McGonagall doesn't want her students to ace her exams.'

Again, Mr Cross turned to Harry Potter enthusiasts to figure out this number.

Fan website Beyond Hogwarts determined that approximately 280 students attend Hogwarts, and that each classroom contains about 20 students at one time.

Mr Cross then turned to a study which
concluded that each student should ideally have 50 square feet of space in a classroom.

Comparable houses: By looking at five large homes in the Galloway area Mr Cross was able to determine that the average cost per square foot is $493

Dimensions: To accurately calculate the boarding school's size in square feet, Mr Cross looked at the number of students at Hogwarts, how many make up one classroom, and the amount of space each student requires

Final sum: With seven floors, several towers and 1,000 square feet per classroom, he calculated the overall value - excluding notable features like the Quidditch field and Hagrid's shack - to be $204,102,000

Following this guideline, he found that each 
Hogwarts classroom would be 1,000 square feet in size.

'Some of you might find this extravagant,' Mr Cross admits. 'But I'll remind you that 
Hogwarts is the cream of the crop when it comes to wizarding schools. 
Surely, the school’s classrooms are spacious, right?'

He then estimated that each floor has an area of about 51,000 square feet, meaning that the entire building - which consists of seven
 floors, an underground level and several towers - comes to 414,000 square feet.

Finally, with all his 
determining factors in place, the real estate agent concluded that the 
value of Hogwarts school is approximately $204,102,000.

The final price, notes Mr Cross, does not include notable landmarks on the property including the Quidditch field and Hagrid's shack.
