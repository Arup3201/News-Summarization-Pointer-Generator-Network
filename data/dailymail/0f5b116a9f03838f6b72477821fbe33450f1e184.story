Fresh Australian milk has hit the shelves in Chinese supermarkets for the first time since a trade deal was struck by farmers to speed up the process of quarantine.

With milk selling at up to $9 a litre in China it is set to provide a lucrative new source of income for dairy farmers in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, who have suffered in recent times due to drought and Australian supermarket 'milk wars'.

Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce said the deal would see an additional 20 million litres of milk exported to China over the next year.

'With potential retail prices in China of $7 to $9 per litre of milk, this government strongly supports industry initiatives like this as they help our valuable agriculture sector improve international competitiveness, which also contributes significantly to better returns for producers at the farmgate,' Mr Joyce said.

The deal cuts quarantine assessment time from two-to-three weeks down to about eight days, meaning fresh Australian pasteurised milk can now be sent to China within its shelf life.

The new quality assurance protocols were developed by industry body Dairy Connect NSW, agricultural co-op Norco and export consulting firm Peloris Global Sourcing Pty Ltd along with Chinese officials.

Norco CEO Brett Kelly said he had been inundated with requests from potential customers and retailers in China since making the deal.

'We sent over 4,500 litres in the first order and we've got customers talking to us in numbers of tens of thousands to millions,' he said.

'It's all very exciting, the reaction has been bigger than what we thought.

'Our plan is to take it just a step at a time - every time you increase volume you need to be able to meet that supply.'

Norco, an agricultural co-op made up of 190 farmer shareholders, is targeting the growing middle class in Shanghai, Sozhou, Nanjing.

'We've aimed specifically for the middle class which is a huge market, very wealthy, very well educated and have a very strong focus and desire on health,' Mr Kelly said.

'When they look at the Australian brand it is very high in terms of clean and green.'

Norco farmer Luke Cleary, who owns 300 dairy cows in Wauchope near Port Macquarie, said costs on his farm were always increasing and it was good to expand into a market where demand and prices are growing.

'With all our costs going up we need to see the milk price follow suit otherwise there's less money at the end of the day,' he said.

'There seems to be a real demand for protein [in China] and as their personal wealth is increasing they're looking for better food sources and I feel that Australian food products should be able to fit that bill well.'

Mr Cleary, 33, said local farmers suffered heavily during Coles and Woolworths milk wars last year which saw a litre of milk selling for $1.

'It was causing a negative feel in the whole industry that it was devaluing what the product was,' he said.

'Milk was seen cheaper on the shelf than bottled water.'

Adding to pressure on dairy producers was the recent drought which saw farmers forced to use up much of their stored feed.

'We've had one of the driest springs for 20 years, this summer just gone,' he said.

'A lot of stored feed that would have been put out into the autumn and winter months had to be fed out then because of it being so dry, the grass wasn't there that would have normally been there in summer time.'
