The Pope has branded couples who choose not to have children 'selfish' and said they are part of a  'greedy generation.'

The pontiff said it was a 'depressed society' that considered offspring to be a weight or a risk.

Pope Francis made the remarks in front of a large crowd during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square, Rome.

Addressing the crowd, he said life 'rejuvenates' when children arrive and they 'enrich it.'

'A society with a greedy generation, that doesn't want to surround itself with children, that considers them above all worrisome, a weight, a risk, is a depressed society,' he said, the Guardian reported.

'The choice to not have children is selfish. Life rejuvenates and acquires energy when it multiplies: It is enriched, not impoverished.'

The Pope had to apologise for offending large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits.'

The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'.

Speaking during a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines, he said that 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.'

Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu apologised on Pope Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'.

Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.' 

Just last week Pope Francis said it is fine for parents to smack their children as punishment for misbehaving. 

'One time, I heard a father say, "At times I have to hit my children a bit, but never in the face so as not to humiliate them".,' the Pope said.

'That's great. He had a sense of dignity. He should punish, do the right thing, and then move on.' 

His comments come after he was forced to apologise to large Catholic families after saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits
