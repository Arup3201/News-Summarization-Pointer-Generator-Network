A children's book by an anti-vaccination campaigner is being mocked in satirical online book reviews, which ridicule the author for telling kids that the measles is fun.

Many people would assume that the book ‘Melanie’s Marvellous Measles’ is a joke, considering the disease is responsible for killing 145,000 people every year.

However the picture book, which recounts a child’s lovely day whilst suffering from the measles, is entirely serious about its anti-vaccination agenda. 

The joke is now on the author, Brisbane-based campaigner Stephanie Messenger, who is now being bombarded with scathing book reviews on Amazon. 

Internet users are posting satirical book review to openly mock a a book by an Australian anti-vaccination advocate, titled 'Melanie's Marvellous Measles'

Messenger says the aim of her book is to 'educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully.' 

She urges parents not to vaccinated their children, claiming that 'history has shown us that these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural health sources, beneficial to the body.' 

The characters in the book echo Messenger's message, with one character telling her child:

'For most children it is a good thing to get the measles. Many wise people believe measles make the body stronger and more mature for the future.'

One star: A comment points out that measles is one of the leading causes of death amongst young children

The Internet has responded, with some people even sarcastically thanking Messenger.  

'As a carpenter who specializes in itty bitty coffins I can't say enough good things about this book, my customer base has been growing at an epidemic rate!' wrote one commenter, referencing the alarming number of children's deaths due to the measles.

He was one of only a few people to give the book a five star review, albeit insincere.

However, one woman enthusiastically praised the book as one of her favourites of all time.

'This is just a wonderful book in every way. I wouldn't have thought that anything could be as beautiful and heart-warming as "Peter's Pancreatic Cancer" or "Andy's Amazing Auto Accident" but I'm now convinced. 

'Up there with "Smoke Yourself Thin" among my favourite books of all time.' 

This book review points out the disastrous and permanent impact of measles on some children

Of the 1114 reviews, the book has received a whopping 872 one star ratings, with many disappointed commenters asking 'why can't I give this book zero stars?'

Some people claimed that the book doesn't cater for the disabilities their child now suffers after contracting the measles.

'My infant daughter went blind after contracting measles from an unvaccinated child,' began one commenter.

'Yet there's no braille version of this wonderful book for me to give her someday to explain to her how awesome the disease that took her sight away is.' 

'I'm so happy I bought a hard copy version of this book,' wrote another delighted customer.

'If I bought an audiobook, I never would have gotten my money's worth as both of my daughters went deaf from Measles Encephalitis. 

'They now have a great book and a lifelong disability to remind them how much I truly love them!'

Some bookworms gave recommendations for other books people might enjoy if they are a fan of 'Melanie's Marvellous Measles'.

'Check out other titles for children like: "Let's Put Plastic Bags on our Heads", "Baby Needs A Cigarette", "Seatbelts Are For Losers" and "Baby's First Pistol."

'Almost, but not quite as good as "Belinda the Bio-terrorist". 

'But I am looking forward to "Melanie, The Neighborhood Pariah"; and "So Many Funerals: A Children's Counting Book",' commented another. 

Uncomfortable satire: The morbid posts use satire to point out how the book uses a light-hearted tone to share a very serious message

Some more worrying posts were from parents who expressed their relief after taking learning some valuable information from the compelling read.

'Finally! A children's book with an agenda I can get behind! I always thought I loved kids until I actually had one of my own and boy was I wrong!' wrote one particularly concerning parent.

'I researched anything and everything I could possibly do to get rid of the little brat, but I didn't want to be arrested for murder and childhood cancer is just too darn unpredictable.'

Messenger is dedicated to her cause, claiming that in modern society 'we are being bombarded with messages from vested interests to fear all diseases in order for someone to sell some potion or vaccine.

'In fact, history shows that in industrialized countries, these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural health sources, beneficial to the body.'

The measles vaccination is credited for a 75% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2013.
