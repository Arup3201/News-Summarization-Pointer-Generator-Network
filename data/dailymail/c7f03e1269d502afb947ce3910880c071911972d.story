Russia has signed a contract to sell combat jets to Syria, a newspaper reported today, which if confirmed, is an open defiance of international condemnation of President Bashar Assad's violent crackdown.

The revelations were broken by Russian newspaper Kommersant, which quoted an unidentified source close to Russia's arms firm Rosoboronexport saying the $550-million (Â£353.5 million) deal includes the delivery of 36 Yak-130 aircraft.

A spokesman for Rosoboronexport refused to comment on the report.

Contract signed: Business daily Kommersant said today that Russia had signed a contract to sell 36 Yak-130s to Syria in a show of support for President Bashar Assad's government

If confirmed, the deal would cement Russian opposition to international efforts to put pressure on Assad's regime over its attempts to snuff out the country's uprising.

The U.N. says more than 5,400 people have died over 10 months.

No comment: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow doesn't consider it necessary to offer an explanation over reports a Russian ship had delivered munitions to Syria

The Yak-130 is a twin-engined combat trainer jet that can also be used to attack ground targets.

The Russian air force has recently placed an order for 55 such jets.

The news of the apparent deal comes the same day that Human Rights Watch called Russia's backing of the Syrian regime 'immoral

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that Moscow doesn't consider it necessary to offer an explanation or excuses over suspicions that a Russian ship had delivered munitions to Syria despite an EU arms embargo.

Russia was acting in full respect of international law and wouldn't be guided by unilateral sanctions imposed by other nations, he said.

Lavrov also accused the West of turning a blind eye to attacks by opposition militants and supplies of weapons to the Syrian opposition from abroad and warned that Russia will block any attempt by the West to secure United Nations support for the use of force against Syria.

Russia has been a strong ally of Syria since Soviet times when the country was led by the president's father Hafez Assad.

It has supplied Syria with aircraft, missiles, tanks and other modern weapons.

Igor Korotchenko, head of the Center of Analysis of the Global Arms trade, an independent think-tank, said the jet deal apparently reflected Moscow's belief that Assad would stay at the helm.

'With this contract, Russia is 
expressing confidence that President Assad would manage to retain 
control of the situation, because such deals aren't signed with a 
government whose hold on power raises doubts,'

Korotchenko was quoted by RIA Novosti news agency as saying:

'It's
another gesture by Moscow underlining its confidence that Damascus will
remain its strategic partner and ally in the Middle East.'

Protest: Demonstrators gather during a protest against Syria's President and Russia in Kafranbel after Russia, a veto-holding U.N. Security Council member, said it will prevent the council from approving any military intervention in Syria

Another
Moscow-based military analyst, Ruslan Pukhov, said, however, that 
Russia might be too optimistic about Assad's prospects.

'This contract carries a very high degree of risk,' Pukhov told Kommersant.

'Assad's regime may fall and that would lead to financial losses for Russia and also hurt its image.'

Human Rights Watch warned Russia that by supporting Assad it is repeating the mistakes of some Western governments during the Arab Spring, saying they were too slow to recognize the popular desire for democratic change in places like Egypt and Bahrain.

Carroll Bogert, from Human Rights Watch, said at a news conference in Moscow today 'The continued support of this regime is immoral and not permissible,'

'Armed elements shooting at government soldiers is materially different from government representatives shooting deliberately at unarmed civilians,' Carroll Bogert, the group's deputy executive director, said at a news conference in Moscow that followed the release of HRW's annual report.

She added that the overwhelming number of victims in Syria is on the side of the demonstrators.

'The continued support of this regime is immoral and not permissible,' Bogert said.

'The West has already made serious mistakes with the support of Arab regimes. Russia's repetition of those mistakes will lead to tragic consequences.'

Refusal: Syria rejected an Arab League call for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy and form a national unity government with the opposition within two months

Meanwhile Syria has rejected an Arab League call for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy.

Meeting in Cairo, the league also called on Syria to set up a new unity government within two months.

'Syria rejects the decisions of the Arab League ministerial council ... and considers them a violation of its national sovereignty and a flagrant interference in its internal affairs,' a government official said on state TV said.

The league called on both sides to end the recent fighting, with the UN estimating more than 5,000 people have died as a result of the crackdown on protests since last March.
