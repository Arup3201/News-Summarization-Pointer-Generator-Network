Michael Porter, a leading economist at Harvard Business School, is being sued by a wealthy heiress

A wealthy heiress has sued a baron and a leading economist after she sunk $77 million into their research company - which she claims is now all but worthless.

Corinna von Schonau-Riedweg says she is ‘stunned’ that her private banker, Baron Wilfrid von Plotho, gave her bad investment advice while she was still grieving over the death of her mother.

In a recently-filed lawsuit she says that she was fooled into investing in Massachusetts-based Continuum Energy Technologies because it could supposedly change the properties of matter.

But after the breakthrough failed to happen she now wants her money back - and has gone to the courts to do so.

She has sued von Plotho, Swiss bank 
Rothschild and, in an unexpected twist, former MIT administrator and 
Continuum co-founder John Preston and Harvard’s Michael Porter, one of 
the college’s most respected economists, who also sits on the firm’s 
board.

Among the allegations is that during 
their nine year business relationship, von Schonau paid von Plotho $18.5
 million in shares and an annual consulting fee of around $500,000.

Now friends have told the Boston Globe that she was treated shabbily and that what happened was ‘very reprehensible’.

H.J. von der Goltz, a venture capitalist based in Boston who knows the main parties, said: ‘It’s very sad it had to come to this.

‘It didn’t start that way. She was definitely taken advantage of.’

The row dates back to 2002 when von Schonau’s mother died and she discovered she had been left hundreds of millions of dollars of stocks in pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

She knew von Plotho’s wife socially so turned to him for financial advice.

As she struggled with her loss, she was also reassured by the fact he worked for Rothschild, a 200-year-old institution that once served Queen Victoria.

Over the next nine years together, von Plotho told von Schonau to diversify her holdings so she sold some of her shares and bought into Continuum and related companies.

The company seeks to change the properties of things e.g. magnetizing copper so that it becomes more conductive and can be used in computer circuit boards.

In the lawsuit, von Schonau says she was told Continuum was just six months away from releasing its first product.

On visits to its head office she was also told the company was valued at $500 million but says now that figure was ‘grossly overstated’.

And she supposedly grew so close to Preston that he would let her stay at his house and took her to a country club to make a good impression on her.

The lawsuit states that Preston ‘assured her that the investments were not risky and told von Schonau that the investments would be profitable’.

The money she invested was not just in Continuum but related companies as well, such as $25 million cash and a $15 million loan into Preston’s C Change Investments

Another $5million of her money went into another of Preston’s companies which tried to convert waste into gas but has now gone bankrupt.

Von Plotho’s lawyers argue that over the course of his nine-year relationship with von Schonau he made 32 investments on her behalf and that only three of them are in dispute.

But the lawsuit paints a very different story and alleges that he ‘preyed on von Schonau’s grief and known inexperience’ with money.

According to the Boston Globe, had von Schonau left her money where it was - in Novartis stock - it would now be worth $80 million.

She still however has significant wealth and is not on the breadline.

Von Schonau said in a statement: ‘I was advised by my bank and one of its senior officers that I needed a diverse, conservative investment portfolio that would provide security for my family.

‘My trust was bolstered by the professional reputations of the people behind these investments: I believe anyone would have trusted the advice of Michael Porter, a world-class Harvard economist. I am stunned by how this all turned out.’

Mr Porter, the Bishop William Lawrence University Professor at Harvard Business School, declined to comment and referred questions to Preston.

Mr Preston said in a statement: ‘I am deeply offended by Ms von Schonau’s allegations and deny them wholeheartedly.

‘I have given my best to every company I have been associated with, and have always put shareholder interests’ first.’

Von Schonau’s claim against Rothschild is that is did not manage her money better and did not keep sufficient checks on von Plotho.

Bank spokesman Kilian Borter said: 'We categorically reject the accusations that have been made against Rothschild.'

Continuum executive vice president Kevin Welch said that none of their investors have ever lost money and that they want all investors to be rewarded for their ‘loyalty and vision’.
