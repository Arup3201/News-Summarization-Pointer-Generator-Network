If you ever need inspiration to hide the chocolate tin then Lorraine Fisher and her daughter Fay are it. 

The chocoholic duo  managed to lose eight stone combined after ditching their beloved treat.

Lorraine, 45, and Fay, 19, from Lichfield, West Midlands, would munch on their favourite chocolate bars throughout the day, even skipping meals in favour of the snack.

Then and now: Lorraine and Fay Fisher have managed to lose eight stone between them, right, by cutting out their favourite chocolate snacks

What a difference a year makes: Over the course of 15 months Fay lost more than five stone 

Needs a new wardrobe: At her biggest Fay was a size 26 and felt unhappy about her body 

Fay said: 'I used to eat at least four bars of chocolate a day - as well as chocolate on toast for breakfast and a chocolate pudding in the evening. But I hated how much weight I'd put on, I was a size 26 and couldn't look at myself in the mirror.'

As a result of her sweet tooth, Fay weighed 18st 2lbs and said her size made her feel low in confidence. 

She said: 'People would call me fat and obese, and stare at me in the street. I couldn't fit in a pair of jeans, the only things I could ever wear was leggings.'

It was an embarrassing incident abroad that was the last straw for Fay.

She said: 'I was going on holiday with my friends to Greece and I couldn't fit the plane seat belt around me. I had to be given an extension and it was just mortifying.

'The holiday was horrible because I felt so awful - walking around in the heat made me so hot, and lying on the beach made me feel so uncomfortable.

'I realised I finally needed to sort my weight out, that's when I told Mum I was going to join Weight Watchers.'

At the time, Lorraine was 16st 2lbs and had been advised by her doctors to lose weight. 

Thanks to her daughter's decision to diet, the mother-of-three decide the time was right for her to also finally try and beat the bulge.

She explained: 'The doctors had referred me to a weight loss management programme, but apart from half a stone here and there I wasn't very successful.

'But when Fay told me she wanted me to go with her (to Weight Watchers) I thought it was the perfect opportunity. Before I was eating massive portions - I'd pile my food up into a mountain on my plate. I wouldn't eat anything at lunch, instead I'd just munch on chocolate and junk food throughout the day.'

Bad habits: Before embarking on their diet Fay and Lorraine would snack on chocolate bars every single day, even having chocolate for breakfast

Transformed: Lorraine was told by her doctor that she needed to lose weight (left) but she struggled to get herself motivated before Fay decided to do it with her

Simmed down:  Fay proudly shows off her weightloss certificate  and new figure

The pair went to their first Weight Watchers meet just 15 months ago and haven't looked back. 

Fay, a student, has lost 5st 10lb, dropping to 12st 12lbs, while Lorraine has lost 2st 13lbs and is now 13st 5lbs.

The pair said they couldn't have done it with each other's support.

Lorraine revealed: 'It's been an amazing experience to have with my daughter. Fay has kept me going and her weight loss has been an inspiration to me.

'If it wasn't for her I'd have given up months ago. I feel so much better now and I go to the gym between four and five times a week.'

Fay added: 'I couldn't have done it without my mum's support. We've been there for each other from the beginning and it's even brought us closer.'
