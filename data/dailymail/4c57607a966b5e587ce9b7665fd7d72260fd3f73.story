Manly Sea Eagle David Williams has been banned for the rest of 2014 over an NRL betting scandal

Sea Eagle David Williams has been suspended for the rest of the NRL season for betting on games including several he played in.

He's among five players to receive bans for betting on NRL games following an investigation by the league's integrity unit.

Another player slapped with a ban was Ethan Lowe from North Queensland, who has played 10 first grade games for the side since 2013, and is now out for two games.

Lower graders Gold Coast player Cody Nelson and Melbourne's Hymel Hunt and Slade Griffin also copped two games suspensions.

In addition, three casual game day officials have been sacked and nine others suspended for the rest of the season for betting breaches.

The NRL's warned even tougher penalties will apply in the future as part of a zero tolerance package of reforms.

The Sea Eagles winger was named on Wednesday as one of those understood to have broken the code's strict gambling guidelines.

The report by The Daily Telegraph also claimed a big-name player from a Sydney club will be banned for six weeks for breaking the gambling guidelines.

The NRL was expected to sanction a number of other players on Thursday for placing small bets on matches - often as little as $5 - following an audit by its Integrity Unit.

There is no suggestion Williams, or any other player, was involved in match fixing.

Late last month, the NRL said it had found no evidence of widespread involvement of players in betting on matches, with initial inquiries indicating there were less than eight players who might face penalties for breaches.

NRL rules forbid any player, manager, club employee or game official taking part in gambling in relation to rugby league.

The latest scandal to hit the game - which comes just a week after the Todd Carney 'bubbler' furore - has broken on the morning of State of Origin III.

Williams is said to have placed a series of small $5 bets on games. There is no suggestion he was involved in match fixing
