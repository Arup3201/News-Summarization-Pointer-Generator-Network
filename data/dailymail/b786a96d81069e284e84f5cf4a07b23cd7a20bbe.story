Before he was admittedly trying to 'screw' his business partners out of the company they helped found, Twitter co-creator Jack Dorsey had a softer side - one in which he shared his feelings of love, loss, beauty and his affinity for Ani DiFranco in the form of poetry he posted on the Internet.

As Twitter is about to become a publicly traded company - and Dorsey is poised to make hundreds of millions of dollars - his Internet poetry has long been erased from his personal website. But his web-based musings live on through a website called Archive.org.

Much of the poetry and random streams of consciousness were posted to Dorsey's site about a decade ago, just a few short years before he and Twitter co-founders Evan Williams, Noah Glass and Biz Stone launched their uber-popular social media website.

Dapper: Twitter founder has abandoned his teenage angst for fancy clothes and ruthless business tactics

Sensitive artist: Before 'screwing' his co-founders, Dorsey wrote sappy poetry and posted it on his personal website

Sensitive: In one of Dorsey's poems, he simply writes 'give me the courage to forget my...'

On beauty, a far-more sensitive Dorsey than the man who forced Glass out of Twitter - after he was essential in bringing the site to fruition - laments, 'beautiful people, but none for me. I find my beauty behind broken key.'

In a poem Dorsey entitled 'Find Yourself,' the conniving entrepreneur writes of inadequacy and his dissatisfaction of everyday life.

'Find yourself amongst the train yard where the freights bring the winds brings that rapidly approaching dust storm to your eyes sitting in the forgotten lazy-boy strewn over discarded liquor bottles. Can you please toot your horn for me?' he writes.

'Screwed': Dorsey admits that he tried to 'screw' business partners Evan Williams, Noah Glass and Biz Stone out of their share of credit for Twitter

Secretary: While Dorsey is expected to make hundreds of millions of dollars when Twitter goes public, Noah Glass is expected to make 'as much as Dorsey's secretary'

The poem goes on to describe Dorsey's disconnect with a 9-5 lifestyle, before he concludes the piece with 'this is going nowhere and you're smacked into 5 oclock realization that neither are you.'

In another rather cryptically titled nugget of Dorsian wisdom entitled 'Forget,' Dorsey leaves readers guessing with a simple, seven-word vignette.

'Give me the courage to forget my...' he writes.

Dorsey's sensitive side doesn't appear to carry over into the business world, however, as it is being revealed that he is a ruthless corporate shark who abandoned his teenage angst and rebellious blue hair for cut-throat business dealings and Christian Dior dress shirts. 

In a scathing excerpt from the upcoming book Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship and Betrayal that was published in the New York Times last week, author Nick Bilton tells the story of how Dorsey 'forced out the man who was arguably Twitter’s most influential co-founder before the site took off.'

That man was Noah Glass, whom - when Twitter goes public - Bilton suspects will 'make about as much as Dorsey's secretary,' as Dorsey himself will make several hundred million dollars.

Co-founder: Dorsey admits that he may have been trying to 'screw' over co-founder Evan Williams. Williams, however, still stands to make close to a billion dollars from Twitter

Besides the money, Bilton argues that Dorsey has re-written history in terms of how Twitter was started, and who should get the credit.

'In dozens of interviews, Dorsey completely erased Glass from any involvement in the genesis of the company,' Bilton writes. 'He changed his biography on Twitter to “inventor”; before long, he started to exclude Williams and Stone too. At an event, Dorsey complained to Barbara Walters that he had founded Twitter, a point she raised the next day on The View with Stone and Williams. Dorsey told The Los Angeles Times that “Twitter has been my life’s work in many senses.” He also failed to credit Glass for the company’s unusual name.'

Of course, Bilton's narrative remains a far-cry from the Jack Dorsey who - less than a decade ago - wrote a poem he entitled JAKD, in which he wrote 'we'll give our creation to the first street dweller we stumble upon...remember to follow the rules.'

Unless, of course, that street dweller is Noah Glass.
