Sean Abbott has emerged from the darkest two weeks of his life to power NSW to a dramatic Sheffield Shield victory over Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Abbott tore through the Queensland batting order to claim 6-14 and dismiss the Bulls for 99 in pursuit of 179 in the second session on the final day of the clash.

His performance drew a standing ovation from the crowd in the Member's Stand as he left the ground. 

Proud Australian batsman David Warner clapped his bat in his hand on the pitch upon seeing the result on the screen during the Test against India at Adelaide Oval.

Sean Abbott has emerged from the darkest two weeks of his life to lead NSW to a dramatic Sheffield Shield victory against Queensland at the SCG.

Abbott endured the toughest of preparations as he dealt with the death of Phillip Hughes.

Hughes died as the result of being hit by a bouncer delivered by Abbott at the same ground two weeks ago. 

A result looked unlikely going into the final day after the Blues began in the middle on 6-386. 

Abbott's spectacular return to the pitch was  widely hailed by the cricketing community on Friday afternoon.

'There is an angel on his shoulder,' cricket writer Ray Gatt tweeted.
