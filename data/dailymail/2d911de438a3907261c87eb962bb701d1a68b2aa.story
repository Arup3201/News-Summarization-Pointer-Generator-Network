One of golf's most prestigious tournaments could be under threat after a group of travellers started living on the course where it will take place in a few weeks.

Seven caravans and a handful of vans were today parked at the entrance to the Royal Aberdeen Golf Club, which is set to host July's Scottish Open.

The event will feature some of the sport's biggest stars, including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood.

However, one local councillor suggested that it might take months to move the travellers on, because the owners of the course must obtain a court order first.

'They have pitched up on one of the most prestigious golf courses in the world and all because they know there's nothing we can do about it,' said councillor Willie Young.

'We are doing everything possible to attract the best tournaments and the best players to the north-east.

'What message does this send to people when you see caravans at the front door? The travellers are actually now laughing at us because they know we can't do anything to stop them.'

Travellers: The club has applied for a court order to move the trespassers on from its land

Venue: The Scottish Open will be hosted by the venerable club in July

Police said they visited the site after the travellers first arrived yesterday morning, but they are unable to move them on because they are on private land.

The golf club has applied for a court order to force the travellers to leave, but insists that the Scottish Open will go ahead as planned.

However golfer Douglas Ibbotson, who has worked as a caddy during professional competitions at the club, expressed concerns that the camp could affect the club's future.

'I think the Scottish Open will go ahead but it's not good for the area and there's a possibility it could disrupt the event and put a downer on the golf,' he said.

'Having travellers in the area has been terrible with lots of waste getting left all over the place very close to where I live.

'I'm massively excited for such a big event to be held in the area and if the traveller site prevents it from coming back it would such a shame.'
