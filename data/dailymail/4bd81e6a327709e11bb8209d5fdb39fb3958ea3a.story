This is the amazing moment when a blue heron pounces on a defenceless gopher who is hiding out in the back garden of a Washington home.

Jessie Garza, from Zillah, Washington, filmed the bird as it slowly walked across the grass, staring intently at a particular spot.

The blue heron pauses briefly, tensing up before it shoots its head forward, capturing the unfortunate gopher between its powerful beak.

The bird tenses itself as it prepares to launch itself at the unsuspecting gopher who is just inches from danger

The small gopher spends one minute wriggling in a desperate attempt to free itself from the predator. 

Then, for one brief moment it seems that the rattled rodent was about to escape to freedom after the bird dropped the animal to the ground. 

However, within a fraction of a second, the blue heron pounced again. This time, the bird is far more confident, raising its head and opening its gullet. 

Then, without any warning, the blue heron opened its beak, swallowing the gopher in one gulp. 

The bird conducts an inch-perfect strike, grabbing the gopher with its powerful beak and lifting it skywards

Despite making its way to the bird's stomach, the still live gopher can be seen struggling as the heron forces down its throat. 

According to Mr Garza: 'For about a week we noticed that this Blue Heron hanging around our home and neighbors homes so, I took pictures of it.

'But we couldn't figure out why it was still hanging around. Then on this particular day on June 26, 2014 he was so close to our house, so I decided to video tape him. 

'When you see this video, you will learn why he was hanging around.' 

After one minute of struggling, the blue heron is preparing the small gopher for its final journey 

With one gulp, the blue heron swallows the gopher whole, which can still be seen wriggling inside the bird
