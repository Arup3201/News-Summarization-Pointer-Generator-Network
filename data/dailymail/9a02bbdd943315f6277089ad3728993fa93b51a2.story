Katie Couric made a toast to her late husband after marrying her fiance John Molner in an intimate ceremony on Saturday, it has emerged.

The veteran journalist, 57, wed her boyfriend of two years in front of 50 relatives and close friends in the back yard of her East Hampton, New York home in a day they very much made their own.

During the dinner following their nuptials, Couric raised her glass to her late father, sister and husband Jay Monahan, who died of colon cancer in 1998.

Speaking to People magazine, Couric said she knew she was the 'marrying kind' and had hoped to find love again - and said she was infinitely lucky to have found Molner, a financier.

and her fiance John Molner tied the knot in a private ceremony 
on their property in the Hamptons on Saturday, surrounded by 50 relatives and friends

'We're just so happy that we found 
each other,' she said. 'I'm really thrilled that I met such a wonderful 
person that I can start this new chapter with.'

The
 non-religious ceremony featured readings by the couple's children - two
 each from previous relationships - and Couric's youngest daughter, 
Carrie, 18, performed The Beatles' 'I Will' for guests.

While there were no bridesmaids or groomsmen, Molner's
 nieces acted as flower girls and two ring 
bearers present him with an 18-karat gold ring and Couric with a ring with 2 carats of pave diamonds.

The blushing bride wore an ivory Chantilly lace gown designed 
by Carmen Marc Valvo heavily embellished with beading and embroidery, 
which she had picked out only a week before the date.

Couric
 accessorized her wedding look with silver strappy sandals, a diamond 
bracelet on her right wrist and a pair of 5.5 carat diamond earrings, 
which were a present from her new spouse.  

And in a break with tradition, Couric admitted that she had asked her husband-to-be to weigh in on her choice of dress for the big day.

‘I hope this isn't bad luck but I actually tried it on for him,’ she said, adding: 'We're a very modern couple.'

Couric jokingly dubbed her new husband a 'Groomzilla,' adding that he was very involved in the wedding planning - but he quipped: 'If this wedding was going to happen, I had to get involved.'

During their vows, which they had written themselves, she promised 'not to check email' during the wedding.

Molner's children, 16-year-old Allie and 19-year-old Henry read from E.E. Cummings and Maya Angelou, while Couric's daughter Ellie, 22, read a love letter from Woodrow Wilson to his wife.

After the ceremony, they enjoyed a meal of mizuna salad with snap peas, dandelion agnolotti, lamb shank with polentan and monkfish, People reported.

Afterwards they ate Strawberry-lemon cake with lemon thyme and garden strawberry sorbets, washed down with champagne and rose and lemon drop martinis.

'I wasn't going to be one of those brides who doesn't get to eat anything at their own wedding,' Couric said.

The couple will take a honeymoon to Italy over the summer and are buying a home together.

Mr
 Molner, a financier who is seven years her junior, had proposed to the 
mother-of-two over Labor Day weekend last September after they had been 
dating for nearly two years.

Mr
 Molner, a native of Chicago, is the head of mergers and acquisitions at
 investment bank and securities firm Brown Brothers Harriman.

The couple 
stepped out together publicly for the first time in September 2012, when
 they attended a screening of The Perks of Being a Wallflower in East 
Hampton, New York.

Since
 then they have attended numerous events together - from the U.S. Open 
last September to the Super Bowl in February and the Met Gala in May of 
this year.

Couric
 confirmed their engagement last fall via Twitter, posting: 'Yes it's 
true! So touched by all the kind Tweets & warm wishes-thank you! A 
great end to the summer!!'
