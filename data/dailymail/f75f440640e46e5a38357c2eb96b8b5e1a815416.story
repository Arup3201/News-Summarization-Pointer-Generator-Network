It was always going to take more than a dotted white line to curb Neil Lennon’s enthusiasm. It was always going to take more than touchline rules and a red card in his first game to wipe the smile from his face.

A debut win will do that for a manager, especially this one who came south to seek his fortune and found a lot of closed doors until he reached the bottom of the Championship.

There were times during Lennon’s six-month hunt for a job when the courtesy of a returned call could not even be taken for granted.

His desire to work had reached the point where he was going public with his interest in certain vacancies, namely those at Cardiff and Fulham.

Yet the inexplicable truth is that a manager who beat Barcelona on a budget with Celtic was not getting much of a sniff in England.

A source close to the Northern Irishman told Sportsmail recently that one of the second-tier clubs approached by Lennon’s representative had failed to respond to half a dozen messages.

But Lennon is nothing if not a scrapper. To Bolton he went and on Saturday, with a win at Birmingham, he began the climb.

It was quite some entrance; it was quite some demonstration of the kind of feisty behaviour for which he became known in Scotland.

When Matt Mills headed the 20th-minute goal that turned out to be the winner, Lennon crossed the line that no manager must cross. He left his technical area on a fist-pumping sprint 30 yards towards the corner flag. It’s a shame Burnley boss Sean Dyche has already claimed the Ginger Mourinho nickname.

Amy Fearn, the fourth official, was waiting with a warning when he got back. ‘You have to celebrate,’ he said after the game. ‘We have lost five in a row, confidence is lower than a snake’s belly. Then you get a goal.’

He stepped out again in the 83rd minute when Craig Davies was brought down for a penalty and appeared keen to take the kick. With Birmingham goalkeeper Darren Randolph sent off and midfielder Lee Novak taking the gloves, it was an appealing scenario.

Except Lennon wanted Jay Spearing or Lee Chung-Yong to take the kick. Or Jermaine Beckford. He repeated the error of leaving his box to pass this instruction to Kevin McNaughton but Fearn intervened before calling over referee Mark Haywood. He sent Lennon to the stands. Rules are rules.

A popular figure at Celtic, Lennon struggled to find work in England despite having a commendable CV

‘If I was arguing constantly or having a go at Lee (Clark, the Birmingham manager) and swearing (it would be different) but there was none of that.

‘I’ve been sent to the stands when I was manager of Celtic and deserved to be, but not here.’

Davies took the penalty and missed. Lennon, sat behind the dugout, watched on as Birmingham launched a last wave. But Bolton stood firm to get off the foot of the table.

‘One from one is all I can ask,’ Lennon said.

Except he will ask for a lot more. He has already told the players they cannot wear hats in training.

‘I don’t mind them warming up in hats but you don’t head balls in games in hats,’ he said.

It’s why some Trotters fans came to the match in bobble hats. They have already taken to the new man. Within 10 minutes they were asking for a wave and he obliged.

They know better than to demand a win — but they got one of those as well.

There might be more under this manager. At the very least, English football is more interesting because they finally let him in.
