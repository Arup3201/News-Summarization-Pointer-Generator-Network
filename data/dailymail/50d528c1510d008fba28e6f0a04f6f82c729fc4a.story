The race for the Golden Boot is hotting up as the World Cup heads into the knockout stages, with Thomas Muller’s stunning finish against USA taking him to four goals for the tournament and on level pegging with Neymar and Lionel Messi.

After Messi’s brace against Nigeria on Wednesday, it looked as though the battle to be this tournament’s top scorer would be a Barcelona affair – Neymar having struck twice for Brazil the day before versus Cameroon.

But Muller’s clinical strike for Germany means he joins the pair at the top of the leaderboard, and there is a growing group of players on three who will also have their eyes on the individual prize.

Xherdan Shaqiri vaulted into contention by scoring a hat-trick as Switzerland beat Honduras 3-0 on to qualify second in Group F.

He joined Karim Benzema and Enner Valencia, who could not add to their three tournament goals each as France played out a 0-0 draw against 10-man Ecuador that ensured the French won Group E.

Dutch pair Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie are also breathing down Muller, Messi and Neymar’s necks, having scored three in the group stages, the latter reaching that tally in just two games after missing their last match against Chile through suspension.

A dark horse to win this year’s Golden Boot is Colombia forward James Rodriguez. The Monaco player is another on three goals from three games, and playing in a Colombia team brimming with confidence going forward he could easily add to that tally.
