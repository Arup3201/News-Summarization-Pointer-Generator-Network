Tragic: Father of two George Falder, 48, was found dead inside a 150C industrial oven at the factory where he worked

A factory worker has been found dead in a 150°C industrial oven used to partially cook tyres.

Father-of-two George Falder, 48, is believed to have 'died within seconds' after being overcome by the extreme heat when he entered the steam operated machine at a Pirelli tyre factory.

An investigation has now been launched into his 'suspicious' death on Sunday evening and police are questioning his colleagues at the plant in Carlisle, Cumbria.

A pathologist has carried out a post-mortem examination to see if Mr Falder had been assaulted before he died, but they found no signs of any physical injuries.

The machine involved has also been tested and was found to be 'fit for purpose'.

Today Cumbria Police appealed to Mr Falder’s colleagues and friends for information about what happened in the run-up the tragedy at 6pm on Sunday.

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Forrester said: 'Mr Falder’s tragic death has deeply shocked and saddened all of his friends, family and colleagues - and our thoughts remain with them.

'Our priority is understanding whether this was a tragic accident or whether this was something more sinister and we are working alongside the Health and Safety Executive to establish why Mr Falder went into the machinery on Sunday evening so we can give his family the answers they desperately need.

'As part of our investigation to date we have spoken to many of his colleagues at the factory.

'We have specially trained officers who are supporting Mr Falder’s family and we are keeping them informed as our investigation progresses.

'They are deeply distressed and have urged the media to respect their privacy at this terrible time and leave them alone to come to terms with their loss.'

An ambulance was called to the site at 6.23pm on Sunday. Mr Falder was treated by ambulance crews but was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Falder, who had worked at Pirelli for 
almost eight years, was described as a 'quiet, family-orientated man'. He
was a keen cricketer who played as a batsman for local club.

In
a statement, his family said: 'George was the kindest man you would ever
know. He would do anything for anyone. He had a heart of gold and he 
will be missed so much by all of his family.

'George was happy spending time with his wife Andrea and two children, Emma and Simon, and loved walking pet dog Bailey.

'George
had just returned from his holiday in Turkey which he had been looking 
forward to since he booked it. We are all glad he got to go before this 
tragedy happened.'

The 
factory, which employs about 850 people and recently announced a £9million 
upgrade, was closed on Monday. The Italian company supplies tyres for 
Formula 1 racing cars among other vehicles, although the Cumbrian plant does not make them.

A statement from the company said: 'Pirelli is deeply saddened to announce a death at its Carlisle site.

'The circumstances of this tragic event are still unclear and the matter is being investigated by the Cumbria police, with Pirelli’s full support.

'The company recognises the traumatic impact to the family of the deceased and will do everything it can to help them through this terrible tragedy.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with them.'

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is assisting with the police investigation.

HSE spokeswoman Jill Inglis said: 'We are aware of the incident. Police are leading the investigation at this stage. At some point in the near future we will know whether we are going to investigate.'

The police have urged anyone with information to come forward.

Inspector Forrester added: 'The Police and Pirelli collectively urge anybody with any information relating to this incident to urgently come forward and speak to the Pplice in confidence.'
