Deadly: The burgeoning popularity of the heroin has been blamed on expensive prescription drugs

A national crackdown on prescription drug abuse has led to new wave of heroin users in America.

It used to be easier to forge a prescription than meet with a dealer on a street corner.

But since stricter rules on prescription drugs were imposed youngsters are choosing heroin as a drug of choice.

The deadly drug is now being found in areas where previously, it hadn't presented a problem.

New York, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, Illinois and Missouri have all been affected by the surge in abuse according to 2011 Justice Department statistics.

The burgeoning popularity of the narcotic has also been blamed on expensive prescription drugs.

New York Daily News reports that drug companies are creating painkillers such as Oxycontin and Tylenol can cost between $30 and $80 a pill, whereas at around $10 heroin is much cheaper.

The Justice Department believe that heroin entering The States is coming from over the boarder in Mexico.

Heroin production in Mexico is now second only to Afghanistan and more sophisticated transport
of the drug throughout the American Southwest Border has meant the it is more available than ever before.Â 

On the East Coast authorities have reported a sharp increase in Mexican-sourced 'blacktar' heroin - a brown morphine derivative - in places where only purer 'white powder' had been seen.

They warn that new heroin users are more likely to die since their bodies are unaccustomed to the side-effects of the drug.

Increased overdoses have been reported in 60 U.S. counties in at least 30 states.

But it's not just prescription drug addicts that are making the switch to heroin.

Cocaine users are also choosing to to use it because of low availability of their preferred substance.

But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription painkillers are still killing more people than heroin.

In 2009 non-medical use of pharmaceuticals or dietary supplements caused more than 1.2million visits to the emergency room while heroin was involved in 213,118. The prescription drugs of choice for over half of patients were opiate/opioid analgesics such as hydrocodone and oxycodone.
