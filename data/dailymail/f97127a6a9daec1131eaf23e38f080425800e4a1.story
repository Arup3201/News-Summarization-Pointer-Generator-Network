The student's grandfather Tom Bradley told The Contra Costa Times that his grandson was from Phoenix, Arizona, a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying to be a doctor, and also was a skilled musician.

He told the newspaper of his grandson, 'He had natural talent. By the time he got out of high school he could play any instrument. He was very smart.. when it came to intellect, he was the brain of the bunch.'

Cristal Rodriguez revealed to The Contra Costa Times that police had informed her that her son had been intoxicated at the time of the deadly incident.

'I don't blame anyone,' she told the newspaper. 'I know he made a poor decision.'

Rodriguez told the newspaper Bradley 'didn't have a lot of street sense.'

Rodriguez also told the newspaper her son spoke Spanish fluently and had been active in high school extracurriculars.

The newspaper reported that other surviving family members include Bradley's father and two brothers.

Seth Bradley mourned his brother on Facebook, writing 'As most of you know, my brother zach died yesterday night after a party in Okland,California. I was suppose to go visit him in a couple weeks at Berkeley. He even sent me a "s******* selfie ' the other day on snapchat.

'I miss you zach and I will always love you. I wish you didn't have to go. We used to be like the three musketeers, but yesterday we lost a memeber. Rip zach I know your playing the piano somewhere.'

Oakland police Officer Frank Bonifacio told The Contra Costa Times the death is still under investigation.
