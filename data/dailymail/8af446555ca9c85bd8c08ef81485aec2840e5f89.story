Sad: Mary Jukes died and was cremated without her family being informed by the care home where she was living, it has emerged

A nursing home cremated a patient and scattered her ashes without telling her son, who only found out she was dead three months later, it was revealed today.

Dementia-sufferer Mary Jukes died aged 84 at Landmere Nursing Home in Wilford, Nottinghamshire, but managers failed to tell her son Stephen, 56, while he was abroad.

Mr Jukes revealed it was only when he telephoned a member of staff about his mother's health that he discovered she had passed away.

'I told them: "'I'm coming over to see my mum, how is she?" to which she bluntly replied "She's dead",' he said today.

Still in shock he asked for help to arrange her funeral, but they then told him they had already cremated her and disposed of her ashes.

Tragically, it was her dying wish to be buried next to her late husband.

Stephen, who runs a music shop, then demanded to know why he had not been informed of her death, and they told him they had lost his number.

Her care plan had gone missing, which included contact details for Mary's family as well as her funeral requests which stated she wanted to be buried in a pre-paid plot next to her late husband Leslie, who died of heart failure in 2000 aged 82.

Mrs Jukes passed away on February 9, 2009, they cremated her a month later without informing her family.

Yesterday Stephen began fresh legal proceedings against the care home and demanded an apology from the former owners, scandal-hit Southern Cross Healthcare Plc.

Last wish: Mary Jukes on her ruby wedding anniversary with husband Leslie, who she wanted to be buried next to but never had the chance

Speaking for the first time since his mother's death in February 2009, Stephen said: 'My mum was a lovely woman who loved my father dearly, and always wanted to be buried next to him.

'If the care home had let us know, we could have arranged the funeral she wanted and given her the send-off she deserved.

'That nursing home is a shambles, a disaster, it should be shut down and condemned to hell.

'My mother lived a wonderful life, we are a fantastic family, but this care home has treated us worse than you would treat a dog.

'They didn't even put up a plaque, so there is nothing to remember her by whatsoever.

'When it happened I didn't sleep for days on end. It literally threw my life into turmoil.

'I can't explain it enough. I spent my whole life trying to be a good son, but now I feel I have let her down.

'Deep down I know it's not my fault, it's those heartless care home workers who are too lazy to make people aware of their relatives passing away.'

Father-of-two Stephen cared for his elderly mother who lived round the corner from him in Beeston, Notts., for more than 10 years.

Happy moment: Mary and Leslie on their wedding day, the couple had pre-paid for a burial plot together

He visited her every day but when her dementia worsened in 2007 doctors recommended she was moved into a nursing home for round-the-clock-care.

Stephen, who has two grown-up children, said: 'It was heartbreaking for the family to move her into a nursing home because she had been so active in her life but we had no choice.

'She still got lots of visits but she was becoming less and less aware of who people were.

'When I went to Bulgaria to finish building a house I told the nursing home to call me if anything changed with my mum's condition and they promised to let me know.

'I came home in June 2009 and the next day I rang the nursing home and said to the woman who picked up

'I couldn't believe it, she didn't say she was sorry or anything. What made matters worse was the nursing home said she'd been dead for more than three months and they had cremated her.

'I was gobsmacked, they not only failed to tell us when or even how she died but they cremated her against her wishes.

'It's appalling, they treated her like an old piece of furniture.'

Mary, who worked as an executive officer for Nottingham City Council for 30 years before retiring, had her ashes scattered at Wilford Hill Crematorium.

Stephen initially began legal proceedings against the nursing home but was forced to abandon them when the costs began to escalate.

But he is now taking fresh proceedings against them to raise awareness of the appalling lack of respect his mother received.

Distraught: Stephen Jukes called the home to ask about her mother's health because he was abroad and a staff member said: 'she's dead'

He said: 'I'm not interested in the money but I want people to know they should be careful when trusting these nursing homes because some of them simply don't care about the people in them.'

Following a damning report from the Care Quality Commission, Nottinghamshire County Council has terminated its contract with the home.

Nottinghamshire Police have also launched a probe into alleged abuse of patients at the nursing home.Â
