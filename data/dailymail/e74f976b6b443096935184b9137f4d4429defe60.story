Drink-drivers and yobs convicted of alcohol-related violence are being tagged with ‘sobriety bracelets’ in a crackdown on booze-fuelled disorder.

For the first time, the US-style electronic tags – which have been worn by the likes of Lindsay Lohan – are to be handed out by UK courts to binge drinkers in lieu of jail.

Those guilty of drunken offences such as assault, criminal damage, drink-driving or brawling in the street will be ordered to wear the ankle devices around the clock.

Every 30 minutes, they test the subject’s sweat to see if it contains alcohol. If a trace is found, an alert is sent to the offender’s probation officer.

They can then be recalled to court, where they may be fined or even jailed.

It builds on a similar scheme in the US that saw actress Miss Lohan forced to wear a tag after she failed to show up for a probation hearing relating to a 2007 drink-driving case.

Yesterday a 24-year-old thug who provoked a fight outside a nightclub while drunk became the first in the UK to be issued with a bracelet.

Augustine Apraku, of Sutton, South London, was ordered to wear the tag for 80 days after pleading guilty at Croydon Magistrates’ Court to using abusive language and provoking unlawful violence.

He is the first of 150 offenders to be issued with bracelets in four London boroughs – Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Sutton – where the pilot scheme is running.

Magistrates can order offenders to wear the tags for up to four months.

If an offender manages 120 days without drinking, they will receive no further punishment for their original crime beyond a police caution.

Boris Johnson launched the scheme yesterday, saying he wanted to target those ‘getting a bit too tanked up on a Friday night’ and causing problems.

The London Mayor added: ‘Rather than lock them up we can help them to beat it by putting this ankle sniffing device on … I think it’s a cheaper, more effective way to help people to beat the booze and to beat violence.’

He said the scheme was aimed at those who have committed a crime while drunk, but who are not alcohol dependent.

Offenders will be required to be at home at certain times of the day – usually twice – so a base station can get readings from the tag and transmit them to a monitoring centre.

If no readings are received for two days, the supervising probation officer will be notified for further investigation.

The policy has the backing of David Cameron, who first suggested the bracelets in 2012.
