A world champion surfer has criticized surf clothing company Roxy over a sexy ad released to promote its brand.

Californian surfer Cori Schumacher says the latest advert by Roxy, timed to coincide with an international surfing contest, focuses too much on women's bodies and not enough on their skill in the water.

The 36-year-old presented a petition containing more than 20,000 signatures to the designer's Orange County offices on Thursday, claiming Roxy is damaging the image of women athletes. 

Wrong message: A surfer has complained about Roxy's sexy advert

Focus: The ad features champion surfer Stephanie Gilmore, but critics complained that the viewer never sees her face, or surfing skills

'Surfing should be a place where women 
can show they're strong and powerful. Ads like Roxy's ads prove women 
are still navigating gender bias that reinforces harmful stereotypes,' she told the Los Angeles Times.

Schumacher said she was incensed by the advert, featuring seductive shots of Australian surfer Stephanie Gilmore's body, but without showing her face, or her riding any waves.

The ad was created to promote the Roxy Pro Biarritz contest sponsored by the clothing line this summer.

'This tells young girls it's more important to be sexy than to be strong or a good surfer,' Schumacher said, according to news.com.au.

The lifelong surfer has always competed without sponsorship so she can easily speak out on issues important to her, such as gender inequality.

'Roxy's recent ad ... reinforces the inequalities women face in surfing and other sports,' Schuamacher, who won her third long boarding world championships in an event sponsored by the brand in 2010, said. 

Petition: Cori Schumacher, seen here winning her third long board title, collected more than 20,000 signatures protesting about the advert

It is not just Schumacher who was disappointed by the advert. Roxy's Facebook page attracted lots of criticism, according to the Inquisitor.

One person commented: 'Utterly disgusted that a brand which promotes natural beauty with vast female base clients focus so much on sexualizing a female athlete’s body when promoting a world surfing event.'

Another said the advert went against Roxy's own tagline 'Women are complex and multi-dimensional' by not showing Gillmore's face.

'You only showed one dimension of women (how they look) so therefore you have ignored who we truly are. There should be surfing in the ad, cause in case you forgot, you’re running a SURFING contest soon!' another commenter posted.

Skills: In the first Roxy advert, above, Gilmore is only seen paddling through the waves, but in a later advert, below, the company finally shows her face, and ability

A statement from the company said: 'We believe all athletes are naturally beautiful, in and out of the water. You certainly don’t have to be sexy to be an athlete, we also believe it’s not wrong to be an athlete and to be sexy, if you choose to be.'

It added: 'We don’t judge one to be better than the other. We don’t believe in excluding one for the other.'

Roxy later released a follow up to the advert that did show champion surfer Gilmore showing off her skills - and her face.
