Jane Shannon, the mother of precocious pageant star
 Honey Boo Boo, regularly makes headlines for all the wrong reasons and 
now her relationship history is being scrutinised.

According to The National Enquirer the larger-than-life character, who shot to fame on TLC'S Toddlers & Tiaras and currently stars in the spin-off series Here Come Honey Boo Boo, has had four daughters by four different men - one of which she cannot identity.

The three men the 33-year-old grandmother can name have all served time in prison for crimes including sexual exploitation, arson and burglary.

Finding fame: She now stars in the spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo along with her family

Honey Boo Boo, whose real name is Alana Thompson, was fathered by David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, 40, who currently lives with the family at their home McIntyre, Georgia.

In 1998, he was sen­tenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper.

Meanwhile her eldest sister, 17-year-old Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon - who gave birth recently - didn't know her father, David Dunn, 34, until he was released from prison work detail.

When she was four he was sent to  court for a child support hearing and in 1995 he returned to prison when he was sentenced for stealing a handgun and again in 1998 for stealing cartons of cigarettes.

 in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the Internet

He told  The National Enquirer: 'Anna looks just like me. They want­ed me to sign away my rights to 
Anna, but I refused.

'I don’t know who my own daddy is, and I always want
 Anna to know who her father is. But June won’t let me see her.'

The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 15-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, is Michael Anthony Ford, 35, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant.

In 2005 he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the Internet putting him on the sex offender registry.

He was also charged with passing bad checks and for shoplifting at a Walmart where he worked.

According to Ford he has paid around $300 a month in child support for years but is still denied access to he daughter and has only met with her five times.

The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 12-year-old sister Laury is said to be unkown and a source told The National Enquirer: 'There are all kinds of family stories about who Lau­ryn’s dad is. I don’t think June even knows who it is.

'We’re convinced June never got married 
to any of her kids’ fathers because she gets child support and welfare 
payments for each of those kids.'

Despite her unorthodox life­style, June’s father, Marvin Shannon, says he’s proud of his daughter and tunes into the show every week.

Honey Boo Boo’s mom June, 33, has also had run-ins with the law. Court records show she served time for cashing bad checks in 1998 and for stealing $3,300 from a safe in a McDon­ald’s she was managing in McDonough, Ga., in 2004, although those charges were later dismissed.

Go-Go Juice: Honey Boo Boo shot to fame early this year after her mother was seen giving her a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull on an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras

Crazy: Once she had consumed the Juice, she was seen spinning around on the floor, her energy heightened

A mugshot of her surfaced this month as well as details of her arrest which took place in Henry 
County, Georgia.

According to Starcasm,
 there are also additional court reports which show that the 
mother-of-three was the defendant in two child support cases around the 
same time, which may explain the theft charges, though it is not 
entirely clear.

It 
came just days after learning that child services made an unannounced 
visit to her and husband Mike Thompson's family home in rural McIntrye, Georgia in March of this year.

The coupon queen, as she is 
commonly referred to, was arrested in a location that is more than 
halfway to Atlanta when measured from her current home, suggesting that 
she may have been trying to escape police.

The family were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer.

A
 source told the magazine that authorities who made the visit 'found 
reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for 
June convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'.

The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mr Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner.

The family now star in their 
own spin-off reality series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has also 
showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, adopt a pet pig named Glitzy, 
attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen 
packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using 
discount coupons.

The source added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbours.' The
 initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after 
filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It 
attracted 2.2million viewers.

Although June sparked outrage back in January when she was seen on Toddlers & Tiaras feeding Alana 'Go Go Juice', a
 mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull, the authorities visited the 
family after catching wind of an online video that showed Alana dancing 
for dollars in a bar.

Stealing the limelight: June (left) has arguably become more of a focus in the reality show than her beauty pageant star daughter (right). The pair were seen on CNN earlier this month promoting the new TLC show

The video, which can still be 
found on YouTube, was not filmed by the network however showed Alana in a
 darkened room, dancing atop of table as coloured lights flash around 
her.

June defended her daughter's actions by explaining that Alana had been dancing in a college bar, not a sleazy one.

The
 'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after 
having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly 
referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own.

June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an 
unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the 
pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and 
spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in 
right now!'

Beauty pageant insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. Describing how 
the drink made her feel, Alana said: 'Go Go juice makes me laughy, and 
play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.'

June has stolen much of the limelight away from her daughter in the new reality series. During its debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit.

She
 has also been filmed taking her family to the supermarket to help her 
shop using discount coupons and take Alana to their local food auction, 
June's favourite weekly activity, in order to bid on what appeared to be
 sugary donuts.

She has 
also admitted that she is obsessed with 'couponing', labeling it 'better
 than sex' in a teaser for tonight's new episode of the reality series. The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, continued: 'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction.'
