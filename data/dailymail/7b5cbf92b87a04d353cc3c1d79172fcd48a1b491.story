A former veterinarian's clinic employee has had animal cruelty charges against her dropped after she was caught on camera slamming a dog against a wall in 2013.

Stefanie Stasse was fired from her workplace in Orlando, Florida, after the alleged abuse was discovered on the videotape.

Sheriff's deputies investigated the case and handed it to the state attorney's office, which filed two animal-cruelty charges.

The technician appears to be swinging the dog in the air using a rope that is tied around its neck 

However, WFTV reports that those 
charges have now been dropped because prosecutors were having trouble 
with key witnesses in the case - who were Stasse's colleagues at the 
time.

The video obtained by the Orlando television station shows Stasse hanging the dog by its neck and repeatedly slamming the animal against a wall.

Stasse
 was working at the Emergency Pet Hospital of Orlando at the time of the
 incident. She has since been fired, according to the owner of the 
hospital, Dr. Mohammad Hassan.

In initial interviews with WFTV, Hassan defended Stasse, saying she was handling the dog in such a violent manner because it had become aggressive. 

'There was no damage whatsoever to the dog there,' he said. 

He said the video was 'obviously stolen' and manipulated to edit out parts where Stasse had handled the dog more gently. The person who 'stole' the video 'obviously has bad blood' with Stasse, he added.

Hassan also said that two people on his staff had been injured by the dog before Stasse stepped in. 

'Human safety comes first,' he said. 'If anybody gets injured its a big liability.'

But a public outcry ensued once the video was released and Hassan eventually backed away from defending the employee, who he had earlier described as a 'good pet owner with multiple dogs and cats.'

'I want to apologize to all of the pet owners and animal lovers who were rightly shocked by the cruelty on the video,' Hassan said in a recent statement posted to the hospital's Facebook wall.

'I was similarly shocked and sickened. We will go forward in the upcoming weeks and months working hard to clear the name of this facility, which believes in the ethical treatment and care of animals, and works tirelessly against their mistreatment.'
