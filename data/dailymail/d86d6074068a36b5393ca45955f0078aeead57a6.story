A father-of-one took his own life amid worries that he was due to be visited by bailiffs over an unpaid £600 council tax bill, an inquest into his death has heard.

Bar manger Aran Waite, 23,  had spoken of 'never having the money to do anything' and could have acted on the spur of the moment, his girlfriend told the hearing.

His heartbroken family have now urged young people to speak about their problems rather than 'bottling them up'.

Mr Waite was found dead at his home in Blackpool, Lancashire, by his girlfriend Naomi Booth, 24, in May. He had earlier left his partner in a nightclub and sent her a text 'out of the blue' at around 2am.

Giving evidence at an inquest in his death, Ms Booth, mother to the couple's three-year-old daughter Tulisa, said: 'He had seemed normal and was talking to everyone. He kept telling me to stay out and said he wanted to go home.

'Just after 2 o'clock I got a text off him but didn't see it until half an hour later. He said he had been thinking about it for a while and it was time to say goodnight. He said "don't let Tulisa forget me" and said he loved us.

'I had never received anything like that from him before.'

Aran - who was manager of a bar on Blackpool promenade - had been worried about his financial affairs due to council tax debts, the inquest heard.

But his father said a £100 per month repayment plan was being agreed with the local council for the bill, leaving him with no idea what had driven his son to the act.

An inquest into his death this week heard Mr Waite had been threatened with bailiffs over an unpaid £600 council tax bill shortly before his death

John Waite, 58, urged young adults experiencing any sort of difficulty in their life to confide in others rather than 'bottle things up'.

He said: 'He loved football, loved Naomi and his daughter and just loved life. I thought he would have come to me if there was anything wrong but he did bottle stuff up.

'The night in question we were all out together and he nipped into town and he was happy as Larry. He was having a good laugh and we never thought anything of it.

'He had a lot of pressure building up in work and with debts. I think it was on the spur of the moment and he has done it.'

Ms Booth insisted their troubles were no more than that of the average young family.

'We had financial problems,' she said. 'We forgot to pay our council tax bills so we had the bailiffs coming round. He was worried that we never had any money to do anything.

'The only things that depressed him were money problems and stresses at work. We had our arguments but nothing out of the ordinary. He seemed upset on the day it happened but said it was because he had a tough weekend at work.

'I don't know why he did it. He is the type of person, who, if he thinks about something, he will do it straight away.'

Mr Waite died just weeks after he was praised by a judge as a 'have-a-go hero' for risking his life to save a complete stranger who had been set upon by thugs.

Mr Waite had come across a man being attacked in the street and flung himself on top of the victim as a gang rained down blows.

When the attackers were jailed in April, Recorder Philip Parry recommended the High Sherriff of Lancashire give Mr Waite a £300 reward for his selfless actions.

At the inquest this week, Blackpool assistant coroner Derek Baker reached a conclusion of suicide.

He said: 'I have no evidence to suggest he expected to be interrupted. It suggests this is a settled decision.

'The timing of the last text doesn't seem to me this was a cry for help. It's a text which indicates intention to take his own life and he did make a settled decision to do that in circumstances where he would not anticipate being interrupted.

Mr Waite's devastated family say they have no idea what forced him to the tragic act, but that he may have done something 'on the spur of the moment'

He added: 'It does not mean he contemplated this for days or weeks because you would have noticed something. I don't know whether he had bottled something up but I don't think it was something he was seriously contemplating.'

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Waite's father said: 'We take comfort with Tulisa and making sure she has the best life possible but nothing will be the same.

'People just need to talk about their problems. Don't keep it to yourself. It's just too much hurt.'

Ms Booth said she wouldn't let her daughter forget her father.

'We are going to talk about him all the time,' she said. 'He was a brilliant dad. I will remember how fun and loving he was. I couldn't imagine him doing anything like this.'
