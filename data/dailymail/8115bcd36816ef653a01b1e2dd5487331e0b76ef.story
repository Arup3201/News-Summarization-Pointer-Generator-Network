A seven-months pregnant Nepalese woman was set on fire by her husband after her family failed to pay him a dowry, which included a buffalo and a motorbike.

Rihana Shekh Dhafali, 25, lost her baby after her husband Farid Sheikh poured kerosene over her body and set her alight.

She also says her husband burned her genitalia with cigarettes and would assault her on a regular basis over the undelivered dowry.

Ms Shekh Dhafali, who had been living with her husband in Miyapur, India, was taken to hospital by members of her husband’s family on the premise that she would tell doctors that she had set fire to herself, a local human rights group said.

When her father Mohammad Samim Shekh Dhapali found out about her injuries, he travelled to the hospital in India and brought her back to Nepal where she revealed the truth about her horrific burns.

She later miscarried her baby at seven months as a result of her injuries and the traumatic experience.

Ms Shekh Dhafali told human rights organisation Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) that her husband’s family had tied her hands behind her back and poured kerosene over her body before setting her on fire.

‘According to the victim, her husband assaulted her regularly saying that she did not bring motorbike, buffalo and other things as dowry,’ INSEC said.

‘She added that he burnt her private parts with cigarette, saying that they set fire on her by sprinkling kerosene over her after tying her hands behind.’

She has now been sent to Kathmandu for further treatment and local police are investigating the incident, INSEC said.

‘When the incident happened about a month ago, they took her to India for treatment, saying it was an accident,’ a police official told AFP.

‘We recorded her statement yesterday, but her husband and in-laws have vanished. We are searching for them.’
