The campaign trail to the White House is well-known as one of the world's most drawn-out political battles.

Usually, by the time the final vote takes place, many voters become fed up with the election.

And often the difficulty of staying enthusiastic is made worse by the whole process starting up again not long afterwards.

The Republican Presidential candidate was asked the cheeky question after being visited on the campaign trail by his wife, son and three grandchildren (pictured)

But it seems having the attention span of a four-year-old makes it even harder to maintain an interest.

Mitt Romney - the Republican candidate for this year's election battle for the Presidency - has told how his grandson has already asked whether he has won the race.

Four-year-old Nate was reported to have questioned his grandfather immediately after he visited him on the campaign trail in Madison, Wisconsin.

Speaking to ABC News, Mr Romney said: 'The first thing he said when he saw me was: 'Have you beat Barack Obama yet?''

Despite months to go until the date of the 2012 Presidential vote, some of Mitt Romney's younger family members are seemingly tiring of the election battle

The Republican candidate, who was visited by another two of his 18 grandchildren on the back of his tour bus, as well as by his wife and son was reported to have replied in good spirits after the cheeky question:

'Not yet, hoping to do that.'

As well as being quizzed on his fortunes in the upcoming election, Mr Romney asked the children about their favourite part of the campaign trail.

Answers varied from the comfortable couches on their grandfather's bus, to a giant jar of peanut M and M's.

Mitt Romney is hoping to woo white conservatives who shunned him in the Republican primaries, but are now crucial to his quest to unseat President Obama in November

And Mitt Romney's grandchildren were also eager to show their support for the 65-year-old.

The Republican candidate fielded a question from a reporter asking who Parker, his grandson, thinks will win.

Mr Romney then asked the little boy himself who, apparently shy, pointed at his grandfather.

Despite the optimism of Mr Romney's grandson, however, the Republican has elsewhere remained cautious when assessing his chances.

On his campaign plane he talked down his hopes of winning Wisconsin -which hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1984.

Speaking to reporters, he said: 'It's just such a long way out.

'So much happens (and) I can't make any predictions other than we're going to work hard.'
