Sheik Mohammed has purchased a majority share in Dewhurst Stakes winner Belardo.

The colt, 12-1 for next year's 2,000 Guineas will carry the blue silks of the Sheik's Godolphin operation but will continue to be trained by Newmarket-based Roger Varian.

Belardo's original owner Prince Faisal will retain a share in the colt for the remainder of his career.

Belardo won the Dubai Dewhurst Stakes on The Future Champions Day racing at Newmarket on October 17

John Ferguson, bloodstock advisor to Sheikh Mohammed, said: 'Belardo is a lovely horse, full of quality and we are delighted to own the horse in partnership with Prince Faisal.

'Prince Faisal has owned many great horses in the past such as Invincible Spirit and we feel that Belardo has a very exciting future at stud when his racing days are over.

'The horse, who will run in Godolphin's colours, will continue to be trained by Roger Varian who has done so well with the colt this year'.

Ted Voute, who purchased the son of Lope De Vega as a yearling and represents Prince Faisal, told godolphin.com: 'Prince Faisal and Sheik Mohammed have known each other for many years and he was happy to sell the interest in Belardo knowing that he will remain very involved with the horse's racing future and was delighted in the knowledge that the horse will retire to be a Darley stallion'.

Belardo has won three of his five starts, beating Kodi Bear by two lengths in the Dewhurst at Newmarket on Future Champions Day.
