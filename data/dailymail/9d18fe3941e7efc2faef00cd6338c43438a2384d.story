Covered in blood and sporting a full row of razor sharp teeth, this creature looks like something straight out of a science fiction film. 

But, with a little bit of camera trickery, what appears to be some kind of alien sea monster is in fact just an eel - caught by fisherman Doug Cutler. 

Using a bow and arrow he snagged the animal with a shot right through its middle in New Jersey waters.

Monster catch: Doug Cutler holds the creature in the air to show its row of razor teeth

Alien-like: The pictures of the bloodied eel have had more than 1.2million hits online

Mr Cutler posted these images on Reddit which have had more than 1.2million views. 

The photos show a long, thick sea animal covered in blood with big, thick lips surrounding a cavity filled with small jagged teeth.

But the photographer has obviously taken the photos at a certain angle and up close because in reality the eel is not as big you think.

Scientists at Outdoor magazine seem to think the creature is a very large sea lamprey, a species of parasite that lives in certain northern Atlantic waters.

A New York Department of Environmental Conservation spokeswoman told the magazine: 'The photo doesn't allow counting of gill openings (seven per side for sea lampreys), but based on size alone, this does appear to be a sea lamprey.'

There have been more sightings of sea lampreys and eels recently in New Jersey waters after old dams were removed from rivers for safety reasons.
