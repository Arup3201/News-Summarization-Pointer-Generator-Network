What was meant to be a joyous and romantic evening for a newlywed couple instead became a horror scene when the groom head-butted and choked his bride.

Police were called to a home at Fannie Bay in Darwin on Friday night, where they were met by the 29-year-old 'intoxicated' and 'dishevelled' groom who was still in his dress shirt after being married earlier that night.

'Apparently an argument began at the wedding reception when the groom called his new father in law a very unsavoury name,' Northern Territory Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said.

A 29-year-old Darwin man was arrested on the night of his wedding after he allegedly threw his wife 'to the ground and kicked her'

'In the car ride home from the reception the groom tried to head butt and choke the bride.

'She retaliated by slapping him,' Supt Jorgensen said.

'When they reached their home in Fannie Bay the shocking violence continued.'

The man is alleged to have thrown his wife to the ground and kicked her before neighbours intervened.

He was arrested and spent the night in custody and a Domestic Violence order is expected to be obtained.

'Police, witnesses, friends and family were appalled by this situation and needless to say the future of this short union does not augur well,' Supt Jorgensen said.

In a statement on Saturday, officers clarified that they had shared news of the incident in an effort to highlight the ongoing issues and problems of domestic and family violence. 

'In particular, that it can occur to any member of the community, male or female, rich or poor, young or old, newly married or together for years,' the statement read.

Anyone who has experienced or is at risk of family and domestic violence or sexual assault can call the 24 hour, National Sexual Assault, Family and Domestic Violence Counselling Line on 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732).
