Almost 1,000 schoolchildren have been caught with lethal weapons such as guns, knives, axes and hammers in just three years, it was revealed yesterday.

Two pupils a day are having weapons confiscated by police on school premises, including children as young as eight.

The results of Freedom of Information requests to the UK’s 52 police forces show that officers confiscated 981 weapons – including handguns, air guns, knuckledusters, crowbars and lead piping from pupils between 2011 and 2013. Eighty of the youngsters were primary school pupils, including an eight-year-old caught carrying a knife.

The figures, from an investigation by Sky News, show 329 pupils were charged with a criminal offence after having weapons confiscated.

A stun gun, an axe and a cut-throat razor were among the weapons they were carrying.

The statistics relate to disclosures by 31 of 52 police forces. Campaigners warned that the true extent of the problem was certain to be much higher since 21 forces failed to supply information.

Based on the known statistics, the figure for the whole country could be as high as 1,645.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has given teachers tougher powers to enforce discipline including the right to search pupils without consent.

But earlier this month researchers from the University of East Anglia, concluded that the Government and schools watchdog Ofsted ‘seriously underestimate’ the extent of poor behaviour.

It warned that pressure on schools to keep expulsion rates down meant that levels of indiscipline were often concealed.

The figures show that the problem is not confined to major urban centres. Police in Derbyshire and Suffolk recovered significant numbers of weapons from children.

And the figure of 981 does not include the UK’s second largest force, West Midlands, which gave a figure – 538 – that included colleges and universities as well as schools.

The parents of Luke Walmsley, who was murdered with a knife at school in rural Lincolnshire in 2003, said a culture of violence persisted around the country. Jayne Walmsley, whose son was 14 when he was stabbed during a break in lessons, described the figures as ‘really shocking’.

She added: ‘We need to think and educate these kids. It’s got to stop.’

‘But
 sometimes it feels a little bit like you are banging your head on a 
brick wall. Especially when schools now won’t admit to the problem 
because all they want is more pupils for more money.’

The last Labour government announced plans to install airport-style metal detectors in hundreds of schools. But there are concerns the issue has become less high-profile.

Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: ‘These are disturbing figures. They indicate a serious problem which needs to be addressed, including finding out why some pupils feel it is either necessary or appropriate to bring weapons into school.’

Patrick Regan, of the charity XLP, which was founded in response to a school stabbing, warned that youngsters were arming themselves out of fear. ‘It’s crazy that our young people are feeling that scared that they have to carry a weapon,’ he added.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We have given teachers new powers. They can now search pupils without consent, confiscate prohibited items and use force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom when necessary.

‘We have also given heads the final say on expulsions by removing the right of appeals panels to put pupils back in the classroom.’

A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: ‘Carrying a weapon of any kind is not an issue for schools to deal with alone.

‘Police and partners will always be willing to work with a school to take appropriate action.’
