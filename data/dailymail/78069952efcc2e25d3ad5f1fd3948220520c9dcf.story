Those dangerous counter-attackers from Colombia are lying in wait for England if Roy Hodgson’s men make it through to the knockout stages.

Goals by £40million-rated James Rodriguez and substitute Juan Quintero deservedly ensured the South Americans secured their second consecutive win as Ivory Coast’s big stars Yaya Toure, Didier Drogba and Wilfried Bony failed to turn up.

Colombia top Group C with six points and are set to face the runners-up of Group D, featuring England, in the last 16.

Despite their defeat, Ivory Coast could also still qualify and they claimed the goal of the day in Brasilia – a superb individual consolation effort from their former Arsenal forward Gervinho.

Colombia were once tipped to win the World Cup by Pele in 1994 – and failed to get out of their group.

This
 team built by their Argentine coach Jose Pekerman is made of sterner 
stuff despite being without their best striker Radomel Falcao for the 
tournament.

Not
 only are the yellow-shirted South Americans arguably the quickest team 
at the World Cup, they matched Ivory Coast physically too. And they know
 how to have fun – celebrating together with a group hip-wiggling dance 
in honour of fellow Colombian Shakira.

For
 once Manchester City powerhouse Yaya Toure was dominated in midfield by
 his permanent shadow Carlos Sanchez and Bony didn’t get a kick until he
 was replaced by Drogba.

Colombia took 64 minutes to make their domination pay after Juan Cuadrado had earlier hit the post.

Cuadrado’s
 excellent corner was met by man-of-the-match Rodriguez who climbed high
 above marker Didier Zokora to connect with a powerful header into the 
roof of the net.

Rodriguez is valued at £40million by his club Monaco and has plenty of suitors including Manchester United.

His
 tenacity and quick-thinking led to Colombia’s second goal after 70 
minutes, robbing Serey Die after Ivory Coast had made a hash of a 
set-piece. A quick interchange of passes and substitute Quintero ran 
behind the Africans defence to score.

‘The
 team is so emotionally strong,’ said manager Pekerman, who is so 
popular he polled 400,000 votes in Colombia’s recent Presidential 
election, even though he wasn’t standing. ‘

‘We
 are never going to lack courage no matter who we play. To see thousands
 of our fans in the stadium helped us in such a tough game.’

To
 Ivory Coast’s credit, they rallied with a solo goal by Gervinho who cut
 inside three defender from the touchline before shooting home.

Salomon Kalou and Drogba were then denied a late equaliser by David Ospina.

English
 referee Howard Webb enjoyed a quieter game than his last World Cup 
match, the infamous final in 2010, but still booked Ivory Coast 
midfielder Didier Zokora who is now suspended for the final group game 
against Greece.
