A woman who nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark ruling from the UK’s highest court which paves the way for her to pursue compensation from a local education authority.

Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be pulled from the water and resuscitated at Gloucester Park pool in July 2000.

Miss Woodland, now in her 20s and living with her family in Blackpool, suffered severe brain damage as a result of which she is now incapable of looking after her own affairs.

Ruling: Annie Woodland was left brain damage after she nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson as a 10-year-old in 2000. Following a landmark Supreme Court ruling her family have been told they can sue Essex County Council for compensation

Her father Ian launched a claim for compensation on her behalf against the local education authority, Essex County Council, and other parties.

To date the family has suffered setbacks to the damages claim with rulings in the High Court and Court of Appeal which blocked her action against the county council.

In October 2011 a High Court judge threw out Miss Woodland’s claim against Essex on the basis that it was bound to fail, and in March last year his view was backed in a majority ruling by Court of Appeal judges.

However, today, Supreme Court justices in London allowed her appeal against those findings which means that there will now be a High Court hearing to determine whether or not she was the victim of negligence.

Five justices unanimously allowed the appeal and ruled that the local authority owed a 'non-delegable duty of care'.

Lawyers acting for Miss Woodland said before the ruling that the Supreme Court’s decision was 'anxiously anticipated by parents and local education authorities alike'.

At previous hearings lawyers argued that Essex had a non-delegable duty of care 'in the capacity loco parentis'.

When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Kitchin said that given the circumstances, it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose the non-delegable duty upon the authority.

Lord Justice Tomlinson added that the
imposition of such liability would be likely to have a chilling effect 
on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable 
educational experiences for their pupils.

It
would have significant implications not just for all education 
authorities but also for all those who operated schools and hospitals 
and, he suspected, all those who operated institutions which provided 
what might loosely be described as education or healthcare.

Care: The Supreme Court ruled that Essex County Council owed a 'non-delegable duty of care' as Annie's parents had entrusted their daughter to her school

The county council was obliged under the National Curriculum to provide its pupils with swimming lessons and it organised regular sessions at a local pool owned by Basildon Council. The teaching of the swimming lessons were contracted out.

Lawyers acting for Miss Woodland argued that the school owed her a duty of care covering all mainstream activities, which applied even where third parties were contracted to provide teaching.

The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in 'determining the circumstances in which a school’s duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated'.

Ruling that the local authority owed a 'non-delegable duty of care', Lord Sumption said parents were required to entrust their child to a school and had no influence over arrangements a school may make to delegate or over the competence of 'delegates'.

He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent. Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care.

Lady Hale said the decision was a 'development of the law' and avoided the 'unsatisfactory possibility' that one child could sue but another could not.

Miss Woodland’s mother, Alison Morris, said she was 'greatly relieved that justice has been done'.

She said: 'It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future.'

Ms Woodland’s father Ian posed the question: 'How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a national curriculum lesson?

'Yet everywhere we turned, we were let down. We are so glad that our lawyers at Pannone continued to support us and put so much effort into getting this judgment in Annie’s favour.

'I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done.'

Relief: Annie's parents Ian Woodland and Alison Morris, shown with a photograph of their daughter, said they were 'greatly relieved that justice has been done', and that they hoped no other family would have to endure what they had been through

Lord Sumption said the appeal arose 
out of a 'tragic incident' when Ms Woodland was 10. She got into 
difficulties during a lesson and was described as being found 'hanging 
vertically in the water'.

One
of the allegations is that her injuries were due to the negligence of a
swimming teacher and a lifeguard, neither of whom were employed by the 
education authority.

Lord Sumption said their services had been provided to the authority by Beryl Stopford, 'an independent contractor who carried on an unincorporated business under the name of Direct Swimming Services, and had contracted with the education authority to provide swimming lessons to its pupils'.

The challenge before the court related to Miss Woodland’s claim that the council owed her a 'non-delegable duty of care' with the result 'that it is liable at law' for any negligence on the part of the swimming teacher and lifeguard.

Lord Sumption said: 'The courts should be sensitive about imposing unreasonable financial burdens on those providing critical public services.

'A non-delegable duty of care should be imputed to schools only so far as it would be fair, just and reasonable to do so.'

However, he said he did not accept 'that any unreasonable burden would be cast on them' by recognising the existence of a non-delegable duty on criteria which 'are consistent with the long-standing policy of the law' to 'protect those who are both inherently vulnerable and highly dependent on the observance of proper standards of care by those with a significant degree of control.'

Referring to Ms Woodland’s case, Lord Sumption concluded: 'The alleged negligence occurred in the course of the very functions which the school assumed an obligation to perform and delegated to its contractors.

'It must follow that if the latter were negligent in performing those functions and the child was injured as a result, the educational authority is in breach of duty.'
