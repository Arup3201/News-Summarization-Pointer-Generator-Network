A vintage vinyl shop boss is suing his former girlfriend for allegedly not giving back his record collection when they split up.

David Carbines, 32, claims 43-year-old Cora Spaans, failed to return his records including rare Beatles and Elvis LPs after they broke up in 2012.

As well as being a couple, Mr Carbines and artist Miss Spaans, ran an art and rare record shop called Abstracks, in Worthing, Sussex, before the split.

As part of a messy break-up, Miss Spaans last year made a legally-binding promise at Worthing County Court not to damage or dispose of any of his things left behind in the flat they once shared.

But Mr Carbines claims that despite attempts by his mother and himself to collect the valuable record collection, some 7,000 are still missing.

Among the vinyl lovingly gathered over 18 years and which he says are worth £17,500, are a valuable early pressing of The Beatles’ White Album and a copy of Elvis Presley’s eponymous debut LP, he says.

In March, the music graduate tried to have Miss Spaans jailed for allegedly breaking her promise - but a Worthing County Court judge believed her when she said she had no more of his property.

Mr Carbines, whose record collection still numbers 6,000, took his case to the Court of Appeal, where he said what he really now wanted was his records back, or cash to compensate him for losing them.

He told Mr Justice Coleridge that he knew exactly which of his records were missing because he bought them himself.

Although some were bought new for a few pounds others like The Beatles and Elvis records are much more valuable.

They had been stored at the couple’s flat but were not among those collected from there by his mum or from a garage by himself, he told the court.

He produced for the judge a 70-page document, not seen by the county court judge in March, listing every one of the records he says is missing.

Included in it are the entire back catalogues of the Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Five. Some are also signed by the artists.

Holding out some hope for Mr Carbines, Mr Justice Coleridge said his case was not one for an appeal, but that his fresh evidence could justify a new case going to the county court.

'Mr Carbines is a serious collector of records and his whole collection he has itemised, from A-Z, in a lengthy schedule which runs to 70 pages,' said the judge.

'It is a most impressive document and he says that, because he bought every one himself, he has been able to complete that from his own memory.

'Not only is he seeking the return of the items, but he is seeking instead, where appropriate, compensation in lieu of the return of the items.

'I am satisfied, having seen the list, that there may be further evidence which, had the judge had it on March 5, could have made a distinct difference to the result.'

Mr Carbines, a songwriter, also says a hard drive containing his self-penned songs and the service history of his 1986 Ford Capri are missing.

Abstracks opened up in August 2011, but was closed by the following September by which time his relationship with Miss Spaans had ended.

She vehemently denies having any of Mr Carbine’s property and was not present or represented at the Appeal Court hearing.
