The sight of John Terry lifting the Capital One Cup trophy aloft will spur Harry Kane on, although the Tottenham striker admitted that defeat on Sunday was 'the worst feeling in the world'.

The 21-year-old striker was kept quiet by Chelsea at Wembley as Jose Mourinho won his first piece of silverware during a second stint in charge of the Blues. 

Terry opened the scoring before half-time and Kyle Walker put through his own net just before the break on an afternoon Tottenham were second best throughout. 

Harry Kane said losing the Capital One Cup final was 'the worst feeling in the world' 

The Tottenham striker wants the vision of John Terry lifting the trophy to spur him on in future 

But, while Kane was down about the result, he believes Spurs have set themselves up for many more finals in the future. 

'It's the worst feeling in the world losing, and losing in a final on the big stage even worse,' Kane told SpursTV. 

'When you see Chelsea lift that trophy at the end it gives you that fire in your belly.

'It's disappointing - the lads gave it everything and I thought we played well.

Kane down on his haunches as the Premier League leaders celebrate at the final whistle 

'In these big games you don't always get the luck you need and I felt Chelsea did with a couple of deflected goals which on another day wouldn't go in.' 

Mauricio Pochettino has taken huge credit for rapidly turning the fortunes around at White Hart Lane and told his players to be proud of their efforts. 

Asked what was said in the dressing room, Kane said: 'Just to be proud of ourselves. We've come a long way. It's a very young team with a new manager.

'To be in a final in the first season is great.'
