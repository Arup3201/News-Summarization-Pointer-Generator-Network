We've heard all the excuses about leaves on the line, or the wrong kind of snow.

But Southeastern Trains have come up with a new reason for cancelling journeys: the staff have gone to Sainsbury's.

A rush hour service from London to Hastings was cancelled on Tuesday because the guard could not be found.

He was later spotted in Sainsbury's, but refused to get on the train because he was having his break so the next train was cancelled.

Finally – and with three train loads of passengers on one train – the service departed, delaying commuters by at least an hour.

Customers branded the experience a 'nightmare' and said Southeastern fares were a 'rip-off' while MPs criticised the company's 'poor customer service'.

It is just the latest debacle for the railway line, which was voted the worst for passenger satisfaction earlier this year. It also raised fares by 2.8per cent two months ago.

Last night, commuter Julia Harris branded Southeastern services – which costs her £2,850 for six months travel between London and Hastings – a 'rip-off'.

The civil servant and mother-of-one had been returning home from work in Leeds to get a connection in London to Hastings.

She was supposed to get the 7.23pm train from London Bridge, but this was cancelled. She then got on the 7.53pm train, but this was delayed as the guard had 'gone missing'.

Half an hour later, the driver told passengers that they had now located the guard who had been delayed on another train but said that he was in Sainsbury's and had decided to take his break. The train was then cancelled and the passengers loaded on to another train.

Mrs Harris said: 'No one on that train had had a break in as long as they can remember. They had been on the go from the crack of dawn.

'We were sat there thinking: “how much of a break does this guy need? How labour intensive is his job really? When was the last time I had ten minutes to pop to Sainsbury's for my lunch? Or did I take sandwiches because I can't actually leave my desk?” So he had no sympathy.'

'There were three trainloads of people on one train. We were more than an hour delayed and everyone was squashed in like sardines. Everyone just went crazy. It was a nightmare.

'It's such a rip-off and such a poor service.'

Earlier this year, Southeastern finished joint bottom of a Which? survey for passenger satisfaction, with just 40per cent of commuters saying it runs a good service.

The railway line, which runs services from Kent and east Sussex into London, was also given just one out of five stars for 'value for money' journeys.

But it argued that the reason passengers did not rate its service was because it took them to work.

It said that it was prone to perform badly in passenger surveys because it 'takes people somewhere they don't want to be with money they don't want to pay'.

And after being slated for its decision to raise fares by 2.8 per cent, a spokesman said: 'When your council tax demand arrives nobody fires off a cheque with pleasure'.

He also said that if the surveys were carried out on a 'sunny summer's day' they would fare better as passengers would be more 'upbeat'.

Amber Rudd MP, whose constituency of Hastings and Rye is served by Southeastern, said the company offered 'poor customer service' and were 'disappointing'.

She said: 'My constituents understand that extraordinary weather has caused infrastructure damage. What they can't understand is the lack of clear information and poor customer service that they receive from Southeastern.

'It has been a very disappointing experience. Southeastern must up their game if they want to get their franchise renewed.'

Last night, a spokesperson from Southeastern said: 'We're really sorry to customers caught up in the problems last night. We're looking into what happened – we can certainly understand passengers' anger here.

'While frustrating for people who rightly just want to get home, anyone working in safety critical roles are required to take breaks after working a certain amount of hours.

'The shift timing was thrown out of place because of a knock-on effect of earlier delays, and we didn't have a standby conductor available to work the train in his place.

'We'd encourage all passengers caught up in the problems to claim for compensation for the delay. Information about how to claim is available on our website.'
