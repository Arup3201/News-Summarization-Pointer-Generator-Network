Wasted: The MoD has bought 2million too many bullets for troops in Afghanistan this year (stock image)

The Ministry of Defence has bought twice as many bullets as it needs for troops in Afghanistan, at a cost to taxpayers of around £500,000.

The department has ordered around four million bullets, despite the fact that forces will be slowly withdrawn from Helmand province throughout the year.

The MoD has said it expects it will need only around 50 per cent of the bullets as troop numbers are reduced from 8,000 soldiers to around 5,000.

But it has admitted it is tied into contracts - described as 'committed purchases in the system based on previous estimates' - which means it has had to pay for the full amount.

The extra bullets cannot be saved for future conflicts as they have a use-by date after which the propellant perishes and they become useless.

The MoD has already started recycling 400 tonnes of brass ammunition casings to save costs after installing a furnace at Camp Bastion.

Out-of-date bullets are also being destroyed at a facility in Sweden, which aims to recycle 95 per cent of the material.

But the department has admitted there are 'limited outlets for reusing ammunition' and that it is attempting to negotiate selling surplus bullets back to manufacturers.

In an article in the government department's own magazine, Defence Focus, the 2million wasted bullets are compared to a family having to throw out mouldy yoghurts.

'It happens in every household,' the report said. 'You get to the end of the week, and you 
are cursing yourself for buying all those yoghurts you haven’t eaten. 
And despite being determined to keep the housekeeping costs under 
control, yet again you are pitching out products past their sell by 
date.'

The purchasing of ammunition is organised by the Defence General Munitions project team, part of the MoD's Weapons Operating Centre.

Conflict: The number of troops in Afghanistan is being reduced from 8,000 to around 5,000 this year

The DGM's Colonel Richard Aspray told Defence Focus: 'Supplying safe and suitable munitions to meet operational and 
training requirements while reducing your spend and using up your 
stockpile holdings means striking a very fine balance.

'Buy too much and your stockpile goes up, buy too little and you risk
 putting personnel in danger of running low at a critical moment.'

An MoD spokesman: 'It is wrong to suggest that the MoD has been wasteful. No-one would want our troops to run out of ammunition whilst on operations and we have to plan for the worst possible scenarios – it is clearly better to have more than enough ammunition than not enough.'
