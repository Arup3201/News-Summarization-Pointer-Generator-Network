A sprawling Arlington, Virginia mansion worth $23 million that was once featured on an episode of MTV Teen Cribs was burglarized early Monday.

Owner Rodney Hunt--whose amateur rapper son Bradley showed off the 23,000 square foot pad's basketball court, sportsbar and bowling alley on television in 2010--says an employee of his who goes by Princess is to blame.

The woman was waiting in a car in his gated driveway before 5am, he says, as he chased off a man who smashed in through a window and possibly made off with some crystal ware.

Welcome to my crib? An Arlington mansion worth $23 million that was named the Washington area's third priciest in 2012 was burglarized in the predawn hours on Monday

'It was pretty scary,' Hunt told ARLnow.com. 'I ran after the guy thinking I was a police officer. I wish I had called Arlington police when it happened.'

Instead, Hunt called Arlington police at around noon.

He told them that an assistant named Stacy, AKA Princess, whose request a paycheck advance he'd denied days prior was sitting in a Nissan Altima in his gated driveway as the intruder fled.

He reported that they may or may not have gotten away with some crystal ware.

'That it was broken into at all,' he said. 'Thatâ€™s just crazy.'

Hunt told ARLnow that the home, which hasn't been burglarized since he purchased the property in 2003, has two security gates and an alarm system.

He said he'd forgotten to set the alarm after getting home late from watching a basketball game at a sports bar on Sunday night.

Not the mansion's sports bar, of course, which is situated beside an in-home movie theater and looks over the full-size indoor basketball court dubbed Bradley Arena, for the sports-loving business scion.

'Thanks Mike!': Sports memorabilia dots the home, including a jersey and poster given to Bradley by Micheal Jordan himself

Sporty: The home also has a trophy room where Bradley keeps his many sports trophies and signed balls and other memorabilia

Bradley AKA Kid Named Breezy showed off the bar and home cinema in the episode of Teen Cribs, as well as the bowling alley and his gold jewelry collection.

The home was considered the Washington area's third most expensive in 2012. It has a 15-car garage and sits atop a cliff overlooking the Potomac River near where Arlington meets the town of McClean.

While Hunt says he sold his company RS Information Systems for $1.2 billion, the home was set to be auctioned on the foreclosure market twice--once in 2012 and again in early 2012 amidst a report from the Washington Post that Hunt owed Bank of America $10 million.

Hunt remains listed as the property's owner.

Oops: The home has its own sports bar, but Mr. Hunt says he watching a basketball game elsewhere until late Sunday night and forgot to arm the home's sophisticated alarm system when he got home

Inside job? Hunt says a man broke in through a window at the front of the Mediterranean style home before 5am Monday. He chased the intruder off and says he saw one of his employees sitting in a car in the gated driveway waiting for the man
