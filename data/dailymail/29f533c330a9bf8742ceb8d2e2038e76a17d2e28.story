The M6 has re-opened 12 hours after a chemical tanker exploded in a 50ft 
fireball, leaving eight firefighters and two drivers needing treatment 
for exposure to toxic fumes.

Huge tailbacks built up throughout the day leaving scores of drivers stranded before the traffic chaos finally cleared at 10pm, the Highways Agency said this evening.

Terrified drivers had fled their cars and the driver of the lorry, which was carrying hydrochloride and paper, was among those who received medical treatment.

The HGV had a tyre blow-out on the northbound carriageway near Coventry, between Junction 3 for Nuneaton and Junction 3a for Coleshill South.

Hours' wait: Firefighters close the road in both directions after nine people were overcome by the fumes and queues of traffic built up on the M6 north of Coventry

Stalled: The Highways Agency set up a 1,600ft exclusion zone and motorists got out of their vehicles and walked up a slip road

Police closed both lanes of the motorway between junctions 3 and 4 near Coventry while the Highways Agency set up an 800m exclusion zone

The driver had apparently managed to 
pull over on to the hard shoulder but sparks started a fire, which 
ignited the hazardous chemicals on board.

Emergency crews, including three 
ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and specialist hazardous area 
response teams rushed to the scene after the tanker blew up at 9.40am.

Police closed both lanes of the motorway
between junctions 3 and 4 while the Highways Agency set up an 800m 
(2,600ft) exclusion zone and drivers were evacuated from their cars.

Warwickshire Police said the vehicle was travelling north when the accident took place and warned drivers to expect 'massive tailbacks' of several hours.

On Twitter, Solihull Sixth Form's account said: ‏'Spare a thought for our English students who spent 9 hours
on a minibus stuck in traffic on the closed M6 today. Hardy souls! Collapse.'

Also speaking on Twitter Shanice Spencer ‏said: 'I will never forget this day! Stuck on the M6 for 8 hours!'

Rob Evans, from Cambridge, was travelling to see The xx in concert in Wolverhampton before being forced to turn back.

He said: 'Sat in traffic for 4 hours due to M6 accident before turning round and giving up on seeing the xx #gutted.'

And Matthew Tosh 
‏also said: 'I have arrived home. Can I find my house keys? No, just 
kidding! I have finally arrived. 120 miles in just over ten hours. #M6.'

Some motorists got out of their cars and began walking up the slip road from Corley Services, which was also closed.

But the Highways Agency told drivers 
to stay in their cars for their own safety, and warned nearby residents 
to keep their windows closed because of the fumes.

Hydrochloride is a potentially harmful salt chemical that is formed from a reaction of hydrochloric acid with an organic base.

It is used in many different 
industries, including as a preservative and even in medicine in small doses, 
since the solution is absorbed into the body in 15 to 30 minutes.

A statement from the Strategic Co-ordinating Group, released through Warwickshire County Council, said all those who were admitted to hospital have now been released with no lasting ill-effects and there was no danger to the public following the blaze.

The accident follows Monday's nine-vehicle pile-up on the M6 at Sandbach, Cheshire, which left one dead and ten injured.

Drivers posted pictures of the devastating blast on Twitter showing the flames shooting 50ft into the air.

Personal trainer Hannah Light was among those stuck in the traffic.

She tweeted: 'Sat on M6 because lorry on fire. Gonna be here for two hours.'

John Anton posted: 'Looks like the end of the world. Flames going at least 50 feet in the air.'

Warwickshire cricketer Darren Maddy, who
was caught up in the traffic, tweeted: 'I've come to a stand still on 
the M6, looks like there has been a serious accident. Hope the people 
involved are OK.'

Chaos: The HGV driver had apparently managed to pull over on to the hard shoulder but sparks started a fire, which ignited the hazardous chemicals on board.

The blaze caused long tailbacks after the motorway was closed in both directions

A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at around 9.40am to reports of a lorry on fire.

'We sent four ambulances, two officers and specialist hazardous area response team.

'The fire has closed both sides of 
the motorway and in total we have treated nine patients at the scene - 
four of which are firefighters and one is the driver of the HGV. 

'The other casualties were drivers of other cars who had stopped as a result of the fire.

'All nine were complaining of breathing difficulties brought on by breathing in chemical fumes coming from the lorry. Due to the toxic nature of the fumes all patients were taken to hospital.'

A statement from the Strategic Co-ordinating Group, released through Warwickshire County Council, said all those who were admitted to hospital have now been released with no lasting ill-effects and there was no danger to the public following the blaze.

The Group said in the statement: 'The group is able to reiterate its assurances to the public that no risk is posed.

'Any smouldering from the scene is a result of the burning paper and is not connected to chemicals.

'Work is progressing to get the people displaced from their vehicles to Corley Services Station back on the road. Our priority will then be to get the M6 open again.'

A spokeswoman for the Highways Agency said: 'Road users are advised that both carriageways of the M6 between junctions 2 and 4 near Coventry have re-opened to traffic.

'The M6 southbound fully re-opened between junctions 4 and 3 at around 7.45pm, with the M6 northbound between junctions 3 and 3a fully re-opening at 10pm.

'A small section (about 40 metres) of the hard shoulder on the M6 northbound, between junctions 3 and 3a, was damaged and will remain coned off until it can be resurfaced.

'This follows an incident at 9.45am, this morning (12 December) involving a HGV carrying chemicals along the northbound carriageway between junctions 3 and 3a that caught fire after a tyre blowout.

'Due to the severity of the incident, the M6 was closed in both directions and an exclusion zone was put in place for the safety of road users.

'Throughout the incident, the Highways Agency worked very closely with Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire Fire & Rescue Service. The incident was police-led until around 6.20pm.'

Monday's crash caused chaos on the busy motorway when damaged vehicles were thrown across its carriageways.

Alan Bullock, 54, from the Blackpool area, died at the scene from his injuries on a busy morning and two others were airlifted to hospital.

One section of the motorway was closed for more than ten hours after two vans, two HGVs and five cars collided, causing huge delays for other motorists.
