Andy Murray has brought his coaching partnership with Ivan Lendl to an end, two-and-a-quarter years after the unlikely pair were brought together.

Both parties described the split as mutual and amicable, with the Czech wishing his charge all success for the future and declaring that he wished to pursue other projects, such as playing on the Seniors Tour and running his tennis academy.

Murray found the perfect foil in Lendl, who like him had struggled to win Grand Slams early in his career, and his bolstering presence soon helped him win the US Open, the Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon.

JUDY MURRAY - Andy's mum, Judy, was briefly a professional player herself. She is one of the country's top coaches and taught both Andy and brother Jamie as juniors. She is now the captain of Britain's Fed Cup team.

WILLIE MURRAY - Andy's dad, he is not as prominent as Judy, and juggles running a chain of newsagents in Scotland with following Andy.

KIM SEARS - Andy's girlfriend of eight years. She is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears and was once described by Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'.

JEZ GREEN - Murray's fitness coach and widely credited for turning him from a skinny youngster to a bulked-up athlete. He puts Murray through a punishing fitness regime, often in the baking heat of Miami, and has him on a strict diet that can often include up to 50 pieces of sushi in one meal.

DANI VALLVERDU - A former singles player himself - if only ever reaching number 727 in the world - he has known Murray since they were teenagers. Acted as assistant coach to Lendl and is Murray's regular hitting partner.

Murray, who is preparing to defend his Sony Open title in Miami over the next 12 days, said: 'I'm eternally grateful to Ivan for all his hard work over the past two years, the most successful of my career so far. As a team we have learned a lot and it will definitely be a benefit in future. I'll take some time with the team to consider the next steps.'

It seems that for now he will work with his permanent on-the-road hitting partner, assistant coach and close friend Dani Vallverdu, backed up by his physio and fitness support team.

Although there had been no overt signs of difficulties between Murray and Lendl there have been a few areas of concern opening up since the 26-year-old Scot returned from back surgery, which he underwent at the end of last September.

Lendl has always made it clear that he would not travel full-time with Murray and has not been with him since the Australian Open, where he made the quarter finals.

He was absent playing on the senior tour in other cities in America last week while the British No 1, currently down to No 6 in the world, toiled in Indian Wells, where he lost in the fourth round to Milos Raonic in a surprisingly tame deciding set.

Champion: Murray was Wimbledon winner last summer, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final

As highlighted in Sportsmail on Tuesday, there have been some particularly odd scheduling decisions 
from the Wimbledon champion this season, which has seen him play far 
more than usual, on occasions seemingly without reference to the bigger 
picture.

In the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's surprise 
announcement, it can only be speculated upon whether this was a source of
 tension, but clearly the magic has gone out of their relationship 
somewhere.

It was always a bold appointment, hiring the 
idiosyncratic Czech who had largely been out of tennis since his 
retirement and had no prior one-to-one coaching experience.

Yet the decision quickly looked inspired when, having properly hooked up
 at the 2012 Australian Open, Murray went on to win the US Open 
championship in September, emulating Fred Perry.

Lendl 
appeared to have added a missing ingredient of a calm influence on his 
player before big finals, which had been notably absent before. It was 
born out of his own experience of struggling to win them early on in his
 own career, before progressing to claim eight of them in all.

There seemed to be no ill feeling on Lendl's part as he described 
Murray today as a 'first-class guy. I will always be in Andy's corner 
and wish him nothing but great success as he too goes into a new phase 
of his career.'

It would 
appear that Murray and Lendl must have decided on this course of action 
over the past few days, as the Wimbledon champion arrived in Miami late 
last week after his exit from Indian Wells and presumably met up with 
his coach.

This has 
shaped up as an important week for Murray as he has 1,000 computer 
points to defend and a failure to do so would mean another hit to his 
ranking, which has fallen largely as a result of him missing the French 
Open last year and the back end of the season through the surgery.

After
 this he will play in the Davis Cup for Great Britain against Italy - 
confirmed in Wednesday's statement - and is then set to have an overdue mini
 break before tackling the clay swing of the ATP Tour, starting at the 
Madrid Open.

Crashing out: Maurray exited the recent tournament in Indian Wells early

Although Wimbledon take into account previous grass court form when seedings are made, thus helping Murray, it would be harmful to his All England title defence if he ends up outside the top four.

The more general need is for him to regain some proper momentum to his career after the back surgery, which itself appears to have been successful.

The situation of the so-called Big Four and their coaching becomes ever more fascinating, and it would be intriguing to see if Murray goes for another big name now.

With Lendl he set a trend followed by rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who have hooked up with Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg respectively, the latter with excellent results so far.
