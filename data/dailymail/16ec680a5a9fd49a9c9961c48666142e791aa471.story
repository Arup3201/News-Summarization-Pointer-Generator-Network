Many men returned to work after the holidays today sporting vacation-grown Christmas beards, including a couple of celebrity gentleman.

Bravo's Andy Cohen took to Instagram Sunday to plug the return of his show Watch What Happens Live and sported a bushy chin.

White House press secretary Jay Carney showed off new whiskers as well as he strode into his first presser of the year.

Scruff: Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen debuted a beard Sunday for his newest installments of the Bravo show

Prickly: Political spin doctor Jay Carney also showed up to his first day of work in 2014 with a chin full of stubble

The normally very clean cut Cohen's new look illicited a big response as soon as it hit Instagram on Sunday night.

By Monday afternoon, over 22,000 Instagrammers had shown the affable host their approval in the form of a 'like.'

'#WWHL is back! And I didn't shave,' Cohen wrote next to his smirking mug.

The comments were also forthcoming and ranged from extremely approving to hateful to just plain odd.

One thing in common: The very different men always had their clean-cut looks in common and now they can relate with each other on grooming habits (but very little else)

'Hot hot hot!!!' wrote tclark143. 'You can totally rock the beard!!! Love it!'

On the other end of the beard opinion spectrum were commenters like tamikadr01, who wrote 'Don't like the beard make u look old.'

And somewhere in between was bloomtown: 'Can u do just a mustache? Xo'

Two hundred miles down I-95 from the glitz of Cohen's New York, a big name Washington politico also debuted a vacation beard.

Jay
 Carney is usually about as clean-cut as Cohen, and certainly has a 
cleaner mouth, but his scrubbed words had to pass through a scruffy 
beard at Monday's press conference.

Reporters 'oohed' and 'ahhhed' according to USA Today.

One journo even asked, 'What happened?'

'My wife says she likes it, so there,' Carney replied.

Approved: Cohen debuted his whiskers on Instagram and quickly won fan approval with a flurry of tens of thousands of 'likes'

Tough crowd: Carney's vacation beard got some ooh's and ahh's from the White House press corps, but he was also asked 'What happened?' by one journo
