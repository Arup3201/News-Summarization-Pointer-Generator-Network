Luis Muriel has sought to end speculation about his future by announcing he wants to stay at Udinese next season.

The 23-year-old striker, who has been at Udinese since 2010, had been strongly linked with a move away from the Friuli stadium this summer with Liverpool, Fiorentina and Roma reportedly keen to acquire the Colombia international's services.

However, Muriel is contracted to Udinese until June 2018 and has expressed his wish to stay put.

'We start again (pre-season training),' Muriel said on his Instagram account. 'I want to thank Udine and Udinese for giving me so many years of joy and just a few disappointments.

'I wish to remain here at Udinese.

'This club has always believed in me and it's here where I want to establish myself as a player.

'I return to train with a lot of enthusiasm and will.

'With the help of my team-mates, I hope we can give the fans a lot of joy this coming season.'

Muriel, who was left out of Colombia's final World Cup squad, scored four goals in 24 league appearances for Udinese in the 2013-14 campaign.
