The Jimmy Savile scandal was branded a ‘cesspit’ yesterday by the BBC’s own chairman.

Lord Patten admitted that heads could roll if corporation bosses were found to have acted improperly.

He said he feared that the television and radio star may have been helped in his sordid sexual exploitation of teenage girls by other BBC employees.

Concern: He said he feared that the television and radio star may have been helped in his sordid sexual exploitation of teenage girls by other BBC employees

Lord Patten also suggested the BBC was likely to broadcast a prime-time apology if the inquiries into Savile came back with damning findings.

Yesterday the former Tory MP asked director-general George Entwistle to review the corporation’s guidelines on child protection following what he called the ‘appalling’ allegations of sexual abuse against Savile.

He also said an independent inquiry at the BBC, supervised by an outside figure, should be started as swiftly as possible following a police investigation into Savile’s activities.

Former patients at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire and another in Leeds yesterday claimed they had been assaulted during visits by Savile in the 1970s and 1980s.

Teenagers in wheelchairs and others recovering from cancer were among those said to have fallen victim to the DJ.

One claimed nurses told young patients to pretend to be asleep whenever the star visited their wards.

And in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, his elaborate tombstone was removed from a cemetery at midnight out of respect for ‘public opinion’.

Police have said they believe Savile was a ‘predatory sex offender’ who could have abused up to 30 victims over a period of more than 40 years beginning in 1959.

Lord Patten and others at the BBC are still struggling to explain who knew what and when about the decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into allegations against Savile.

On Sunday former director-general Mark Thompson, who left his post last month, said he had never heard any rumours or received any complaints or allegations about Savile when he was in charge.

But yesterday Lord Patten – who said he himself first heard about the Savile allegations less than two weeks ago when he read about them in a newspaper – insisted said Mr Thompson had been made aware of the Newsnight investigation last December by director of news Helen Boaden.

When asked to confirm that the former director-general knew about the investigation, he said: ‘Yes’.

His comments were later retracted by the BBC Trust, which said he ‘misspoke’ on the matter.

When asked if he was convinced there were not others taking part or helping Savile with these type of activities at the BBC, Lord Patten said: ‘No’.

He also said that bosses could lose their jobs if they were found guilty of impropriety over their handling of the issue.

Addressing a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch yesterday, Lord Patten began with the words: ‘I would like to say one or two things about the appalling allegations and the cesspit of the Jimmy Saville allegations.’

But later there were tough questions for him to answer about how current BBC director-general George Enwistle could oversee the organising the independent inquiry when he was one of the executives facing questions about what he knew.

Under scrutiny: Scotland Yard has formally recorded eight criminal allegations - two rapes and six indecent assaults - against the former TV presenter so far in its Operation Yewtree investigation

Mr Entwistle was one of the executives who were told about the Newsnight investigation into Savile last year, although it is denied he knew the exact nature of the allegations.

There had been criticism that the BBC had ditched the investigation on its Newsnight programme late last year because it would have run counter to other celebratory shows about the once popular presenter which were then being prepared for broadcast.

But Lord Patten said yesterday the editor of Newsnight was ‘not leaned on’, and no BBC executives had intervened.

Earlier this week Mr Entwistle made an apology to Savile’s victims during an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme and said there would be an inquiry to follow the police investigation.

Inquiry: Lord Patten said he was sure the BBC inquiry will look into allegations made by other presenters such as Liz Kershaw, who revealed she was groped by a colleague while she was on air

Lord Patten said yesterday: ‘The BBC has in place child protection policies, processes, guidance for us by all staff on and off the premises and independents making programmes for the BBC.

‘We’ve asked the director-general to assure us that those policies are up to date and fit for purpose that they’re effective in protecting minors and under-age children.

‘We’ve also said that we want to be satisfied on the arrangements in place for dealing with sexual harassment, bullying and whistleblowing and we want to be sure that those guidelines that do exist are gold standard and up to date and comply with current best practice.’

Abuse: Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where Jimmy Savile was allegedly free to prey upon young patients, despite the staff knowing about his behaviour

Lord Patten suggested that the internal inquiry will not look at the editorial decision by Newsnight, saying he did not want to question the ‘journalistic integrity’ of people.

But insiders admitted yesterday that it is likely to look at what bosses did with the information contained within it when they were made aware of the allegations.

Asked what would happen if any 
current BBC employees such as the director general and other executives 
were found to have acted improperly, Lord Patten said: ‘You would not 
expect any employee of a newspaper or the BBC to survive if her or she 
was found to have behaved improperly.’

He
said he was sure the BBC inquiry will look into allegations made by 
other presenters such as Liz Kershaw, who revealed she was groped by a 
colleague while she was on air.

Difficult: Funeral director Robert Morphet said the stone had taken 8 months to create but only hours to tear down

Gone: The headstone was only put in place three weeks ago

And Greater Manchester and Tayside Police became the latest forces to receive complaints of abuse by Savile, who died in October last year. 

Greater Manchester Police said 
allegations about his activities have followed day after day following 
an ITV documentary which aired last week.

Jimmy Savile is today lying in an 
unmarked grave after a dead-of-night operation to remove his £4,000 
headstone at the request of his family.

Undertakers worked in the dark to rip
out the giant memorial and have said it will 'be broken up, placed in a
skip and used as landfill'.

The gates of Woodlands Cemetery in 
Scarborough, North Yorkshire, were locked at around 11pm on Tuesday 
night and police stood guard for the two-hour operation.

His
loved-ones did not attend and while they had ordered the removal of the
grave they were not aware of the undertakers’ decision to do it in the 
middle of the night.

They
were to wait until 7am on Wednesday before removing the six foot wide 
by four foot tall headstone with Savile’s now inflammatory epitaph: 'It 
was good while it lasted.'

All its inscriptions will be ground away before the stone is destroyed.

Decision: Savile's family gave permission for its removal out of respect for public opinion - with the scene shown here at dawn

Respect: Savile's family gave permission for its removal out of respect for public opinion - shown here shortly after it was removed

Message: A card also left there thanks Savile for the times they shared together from a well-wisher called Shannon

Below it is Savile's body, encased in concrete at a 45 degree angle, so he could 'see' the sea and Scarborough castle - his dying wish.

The Savile family said in a statement: 'Members of the family of Sir Jimmy Savile have decided to remove his headstone from the grave in Scarborough.

'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery.

'Out of respect to public opinion, to those who are buried there, and to those who tend their graves and visit there, we have decided to remove it.'

The Savile family feared the grave could become the centre of a media circus and could have been attacked, so gave funeral director Robert Morphet a free hand to carry out what he called 'a discreet' operation.
