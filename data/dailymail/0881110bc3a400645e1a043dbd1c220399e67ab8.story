Steve Bruce has already fielded phone calls from clubs interested in Andrew Robertson – and admits it is perhaps inevitable he will one day be lured from Hull City.

The 20-year-old left back – signed from Dundee United for just £2.85million in the summer – has already made a big impression at the KC Stadium and scored Scotland’s goal during their 3-1 defeat to England in midweek.

That rampaging raid on the opposition penalty area won him comparison to Gareth Bale, and it is the Real Madrid star’s former club, Spurs, who Robertson faces on Sunday.

But Tigers boss Bruce concedes that, like Bale and former Southampton teenager Luke Shaw, it might not be too long before bigger clubs come calling with serious offers.

‘There has already been one or two with phone calls asking “to keep me informed”,’ says Bruce, whose side are without a win in four in the Premier League.

‘That’s always the first stage. I had it with (Wilson) Palacios when I was at Wigan and then (Antonio) Valencia when he went off to Man United. And if this kid keeps performing the way he is then it might become inevitable.

‘Look at Luke Shaw – he only played one year, didn’t he? That’s how crazy it is: £32million, you could buy the Humber Bridge for that!’

Robertson, an attacking defender, is very much in the mould of Bale and Shaw. And that is a likeness Bruce welcomes.

‘These days, the higher up you go, the full-backs play as wing-backs,’ he said. ‘The modern game is such that they really do give you the width. If you look at all the top teams the two full-backs are high up the pitch constantly and that will always suit Andy.

‘He wants to get forward, he’s no mean defender himself but he’s blessed with this ability to run quickly and it seems effortless for him.’

Bruce, though, also sounded caution, as he added: ‘We will have to protect him over the next couple of years I would have thought, but certainly if he keeps improving the way he is then he’s got a wonderful future ahead of him.

‘But he’s the type who wants to do well, he wants to improve, he wants to be a top player. He has got all that drive in him so we will make sure he doesn’t get carried away with himself because we have got arguably one of the best young players in the country.’

Hull’s scouting team had tracked Robertson for the bulk of last season and strongly advised Bruce to follow through with their recommendation.

It was something the manager had no hesitation in doing.

‘There is a lot of hard work that goes on beneath (the signing),’ he revealed. 'My scouts followed him and it’s all their hard work. I made the decision to say yes because the people I employ said “yes”.

‘But you just had to look at him at Dundee last year – the natural aspects and think “wow”.

‘As soon as you see him whoosh up that line you go “bloomin’ heck”. There are not many people that move like that very often. It’s reward for everybody at the club, but more rewarding for him than anybody.’
