Michael Rogers of Australia won the longest stage of the Tour de France, after leading a breakaway to a downhill finish as the race entered the Pyrenees mountains. 

Rogers gave his Tinkoff-Saxo team their second stage win this year by finishing the 237.5km mountain trek from Carcassonne strongly.

The Australian, a former world champion, took a bow as he crossed the line at Bagneres-de-Luchon to collect his first Tour stage victory.

Italian rider Vincenzo Nibali maintained his lead at the top of the general classification standings after Stage 16...

Rogers came close not to riding on this Tour for Tinkoff-Saxo Bank team.

In a ruling announced in April, the International Cycling Union accepted that meat Rogers ate in China last year likely caused his positive doping test at the Japan Cup shortly afterward.

Rogers, a crucial teammate of two-time Tour champion Alberto Contador, convinced the UCI he wasn't intending to cheat, and said the episode was 'a very difficult time' for his family.

He raced last October in China, where clenbuterol is widely administered to livestock to build muscle and reduce fat.

The UCI said it disqualified Rogers from the Japanese race but consulted the World Anti-Doping Agency before deciding 'he should not be sanctioned any further.'

Vincenzo 
Nibali of Italy retained the overall leader's yellow jersey ahead of 
Spain's Alejandro Valverde while France's Thibaut Pinot, who was the 
strongest in the intimidating ascent to the Port de Bales, moved up to 
third at the expense of compatriot Romain Bardet.

Nibali
 and Valverde crossed the line together about nine minutes down on the 
leaders to retain the two top spots in the general classification.

World champion Rui Costa of Portugal did not start the stage as he withdrew suffering from pneumonia.

'He
 was forced to withdraw after an X-ray examination carried out during 
the rest day at a clinic in Pezenas showed an outbreak of pneumonia,' 
his Lampre team said.

Aside from a penultimate stage time trial, Stage 17 starting in Saint-Gaudens will be the shortest this year at 124.5 km (77 miles). It features three hard Category 1 climbs, and an ascent to Saint-Lary Pla d'Adet ski station.
