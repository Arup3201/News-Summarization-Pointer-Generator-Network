NASCAR driver Jason Leffler was everything to his five-year-old son Charlie Dean.

In scores of photographs on Instagram and on the two-time NASCAR Nationwide Series winner's website, the little boy is seen beaming, idolizing his famous father as he proudly watches him race from the sidelines, or plays toy cars with him at home - and the adoration is clearly reciprocated.

But yesterday, the child was left without a father after 37-year-old Leffler's Sprint Car tragically flipped and high banked the dirt oval at an event at New Jersey's Bridgeport Speedway, as thousands of stunned fans watched on.

The driver was extracted from the car
and airlifted by helicopter to hospital where he was pronounced dead 
shortly after 9 p.m. The rest of the event was cancelled.

Tributes
poured in for Leffler, who made 423 starts in NASCAR's three national 
series, winning twice on the Nationwide Series and once on the Truck 
Series, as word of the the horror crash spread.

Many of his fellow track stars praised his talents while others noted the risk drivers like Leffler, whose nickname was Lefturn, take every time they strap themselves in.

Tony Kanaan 
tweeted: '#LEFturn was a racer. A champion. Jason we race this weekend 
in your honor.' Kyle Busch wrote last night: 'Deeply saddened by the 
passing of @JasonLeffler tonight. Please keep his family in your 
thoughts and prayers. #LEFturn'

While
Landon Cassill said: 'Had a great talk with him just the other day. We 
reminded each other why we love racing and do what we do. He was family.
#lefturn'

Heartbroken: Jason's girlfriend Julianna Patterson, pictured right with him, posted a series of photos of the driver on Instagram today

NASCAR itself wrote in a statement after the tragedy: 'NASCAR extends its thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to the family of Jason Leffler who passed away earlier this evening. For more than a decade, Jason was a fierce competitor in our sport and he will be missed.'

But most heart-breaking were the messages from his loved ones.

Leffler had separated from Charlie Dean's mother, Alison East, and now shared his life with Julianna Patterson, who is also seen in many of the photographs he shared on Instagram, documenting his life.

On Thursday, Patterson, 27, uploaded a 
series of tear-jerking pictured on her own Instagram page, remembering the bond she and Leffler shared and the beautiful relationship the race-car driver had with his young son.

'Morning cuddles melt my heart,' she wrote under one picture showing the father and son asleep next to each other.

'Two peas ina pod (sic),' she wrote on another image showing the boys enjoying ice cream sandwiches together on the couch.

Under a photo showing herself and Leffler beaming, she wrote, simply: 'Love.'

The couple lived together in Huntersville, North Carolina with little Charlie Dean.

Almost a year ago, Patterson became head of sponsorship at Lefturn Il where she was in charge of the sales, marketing and sponsorship of Jason Leffler racing and the Jason Leffler Sponsorship Packet.

Leffler suffered serious injuries when his Sprint Car flipped as he hit a stretch of the 5/8-mile and high banked the dirt oval at the heat-race event in New Jersey. He was airlifted to Crozer-Chester Medical Center where he tragically died shortly after 9 p.m.

After
losing his NASCAR ride, Leffler had been racing dirt car events most of
this year, including the 410 Sprint Car race on Wednesday that promised
a $7,000 prize to the winner at the 0.625-mile, high-banked dirt oval. 
On Sunday, Leffler finished last at Pocono in his lone NASCAR Sprint Cup
start of the year.

Sad: 'Morning cuddles melt my heart,' Leffler's girlfriend Julianna Patterson wrote next to this photo on Instagram on Thursday

RIP: Colleagues and fans rushed to pay tribute to the racer, pictured, who died tragically at just 37

From
Long Beach, California, Leffler made 423 starts in NASCAR's three 
national series and also made three IndyCar Series starts, finishing 
17th in the 2000 Indianapolis 500.

Leffler's last full NASCAR season was 2011, when he ran the entire Nationwide schedule for Turner Motorsports. He finished sixth in the standings that season and hadn't had a steady NASCAR ride since.

Although he never made it at the Sprint Cup Series level, Leffler ran almost the entire 2001 season for Chip Ganassi Racing and ran 19 races in 2005 for Joe Gibbs Racing in the car now driven by Denny Hamlin.
