'It is disappointing to lose in my third straight [Tokyo] final,' Raonic said. 

'It was a great match. We both played a high level of tennis. At the beginning, the match was passing by really quick, but in the second and third set it was really good. He has been playing with a lot of confidence, he went for his shots and it paid off.

'I am playing at a really high level. Kei has, consistently over the past few weeks, also played at a high level. The match was high quality and I look forward to the next challenge in Shanghai. I need to turn up there with the right attitude and fight again.'
