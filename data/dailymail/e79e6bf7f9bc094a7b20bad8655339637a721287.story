There's a private port built for a 70-foot yacht, a protected 536-foot long canal and 6.9 quiet acres of land hidden from street view, all set atop an ancient coral reef in an area known as the 'original Miami'.

Welcome to La Brisa: A Biscayne Bay waterfront that harks back to the glory days of south Florida; an area that has attracted business tycoons, artists, novelists and celebrities since the late 1800s.

And the nine-bedroom mansion has just been listed for sale for $65 million.

'This is an extremely rare opportunity to purchase not just part of Miami’s colorful history, but to own spectacular Hammock that rivals a private reserve in the heart of Miami’s famed Coconut Grove neighborhood, with 207 feet of waterfront on Biscayne Bay,' said real estate agent William P.D. Pierce.

The sprawling estate features a 1920s-era home with a Mediterranean feel and a total square footage of 17,141.
