He has arguably dominated the world through his media empire for several decades, and now Rupert Murdoch looks set to take over the skies.

But rather than jet off from the seat of a cockpit, the News Corp chairman today launched his first mission into modest altitudes from the comfort of a remote control he used to navigate a drone.

The media giant, who was attending a digital technology conference, WSJD Live, in Laguna Beach, California, soon after posted a photo of the premier voyage on his personal Twitter account.

The media giant launched his first drone - which many believe are an unwanted intrusion in their lives

Murdoch, 83, said in a short statement to announce his take-off: ‘Trying out my new drone.’

But for the media tycoon,  not everyone responded kindly to the mission with some on social media hitting out at News Corp's record of privacy in the wake of the phone hacking trials.

The Daily Rupert @TheMurdochTimes, wrote: 'Rupert Murdoch has a drone. Can it remotely hack phones and computers (as well as spy on celebrities)? He won't say'. 

Another, Spy Scroll @SpyScroll, said: 'Rupert Murdoch flies a drone – Twitter responds: Rupert Murdoch has a drone. Can it remotely hack phones ...' 

Many fear that drones, which can be equipped with cameras, will be another unwanted intrusion into their lives. They can be bought in shops and can be controlled with iPhones and iPads.

Hobby enthusiasts and paparazzi are known to use the electronic planes which have sparked a privacy debate over mass use of the electronic devices.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), America's airspace management body, in September reversed its ban on the commercial use of drones.

The FAA approved exemptions for six aerial production companies to use the miniature planes for the purpose of filming motion pictures and TV programs. 

The New York-based Wall Street Journal, which is a Murdoch-owned title, hosted the digital conference today.

Major players in the Tech world turned up including including Apple chief executive Tim Cook, former Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer, Alibaba chief Jack Ma and also director James Cameron.
