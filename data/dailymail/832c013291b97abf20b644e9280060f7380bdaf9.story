Syria may be in the grip of an unrelenting civil war with its murderous regime facing the threat of impending American intervention, yet on the Syrian Presidency’s Instagram account the county’s first lady is attempting to paint a very different picture of her county.

The social media platform is being used by the regime as a sickening propaganda tool as they attempt to sell a lie to the outside world that all is well.

The main stooge in this shameless PR exercise is the president’s wife Asma al Assad who it seems is all too willing to try and mask the horrific atrocities being carried out by her husband’s forces. 

Shameless propaganda: The Syrian government posted this photo op, left, featuring the country’s first lady on Wednesday, while in reality men inspect a site hit by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad

Different worlds: This photo of the President and his wife was posted on the Syrian Presidency’s Instagram account on July 30, the same day that Bashar al-Assad’s forces carried out this attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus

Even as photographic evidence emerges from the country showing what Assad’s regime are doing to his people, the Instragram account attempts to sell an alternative version of events where the president’s wife is photographed smiling as she hugs old women and ladles out soup to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers.

In reality the photographs show that British-born Asma al-Assad has become a Marie Antoinette figure, completely out of touch with what is really going on in the country.

In some photographs recently posted on Instagram, she is shown wearing a new blue Jawbone UP on her right wrist – a device designed to help wearers keep track of how many steps they take and calories they burn.

The Instagram account was opened in July in what an apparent attempt to win back favor across the globe, but it didn't take long before it backfired.

No one smiles: British-born Asma al-Assad reaches out to a clearly uncomfortable girl on August 11, while elsewhere in Syria a woman carrying a bag of bread exits a bakery run by the Islamic rebel group ‘Ahrar Al-Sham’

The staged publicity shots are fooling very few and although some users have comment on Mrs al-Assad's 'beautiful soul,' the majority are less forgiving.

'I love ur designer clothes and shoes... paid for by the blood of your people! Seriously, u make Marie Antoinette look like an angel compared to you!,' wrote one Instagram user.

Others comment on the 'hypocrisy' of Mrs al-Assad being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year Syrian war.

To date, more than 100,000 men, women and children have been killed and nearly two million Syrians have fled the country since the conflict started in March 2011

But as millions have fled the fighting to neighboring states, the Syrian regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life-as-normal image for the President and his family.

Nadim Houry, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and East Africa, said Al-Assad's Instagram account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

He said: 'I think it is a generational thing, I am not aware older leaders like Mubarak and Gaddafi used social networking, but the Syrian regime has always been keen to show a business-like image to the world.

'I am not surprised by this account, but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs, arbitrary arrests, human rights abuses and violence.

'Bashar Al-Assad is not going to show the millions of people displaced, it's not going to show attacks on civilians.'

The Syrian Presidency’s Instagram account attempts to portray an alternative reality where Bashar al Assad appears presidential such as in this August 8 photo, but meanwhile a Free Syrian Army fighter uses a mirror to monitor the movements of the president's forces elsewhere as the civil war rages on

Amnesty International UK Syria campaign manager, Kristyan Benedict, said: 'On one level you'd have to say that it's not surprising to find any government, even the rigid and oppressive one in Damascus, using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view.

'Image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in President Assad's "love me or I'll kill you" strategy.

'Naturally, we'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in Syria - of the torture chambers or places of execution. Seeing the Assads in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that Syrian government hospitals have been used as places of torture.

'No amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the stain on the Syrian government's record.'
