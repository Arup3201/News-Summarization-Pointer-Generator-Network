New Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis (pictured) wants to stop customers deserting for discounters Lidl and Aldi

Top executives at Tesco have been forced to shop and cook like housewives as part of a plan to put them back in touch with their customers.

The bosses were sent food shopping at Tesco and at all its main rivals then whisked away to a small, remote holiday cottage in Norfolk.

The plan was the brainchild of Dave Lewis, who took over the chief executive job at Tesco last month, in an effort to encourage his 15 most senior executives to see the business from the point of view of ordinary shoppers.

He arrived seven weeks ago only to be faced with a massive profits slide at the company and a shock accounting scandal that has rocked the stock market and seen Tesco shares slump.

But he wants to quickly find ways to stop customers deserting for German discounters Aldi and Lidl and to sweep away a culture at Tesco that included operating six corporate jets. He is already close to selling two of them.

Mr Lewis told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I think if you’re in our business and you’re not spending all of your time looking at the quality and the presentation and the taste of the food and the products you serve – what are you doing?’

‘I took my executive team away for a day and a night. It’s been a very frenetic time and I wanted to get to know the people and talk about where the business was and where it was heading.

‘So I took them off to a tiny self-catering place in Norfolk.

‘Let’s just say it was a damn sight cheaper than most hotels would cost you.’

Among those present were acting UK chief Robin Terrell; Trevor Masters, who runs the company’s £10 billion Asian business; Tesco bank chief Benny Higgins; group property director Steve Rigby; group corporate affairs director Rebecca Shelley and David Hobbs, group business planning director.

Apart from discussing strategies, they also prepared meals. ‘I said to them, “You two get breakfast for the group, you do lunch and we’ll do dinner.”

‘The meals had to come from Tesco and the competition so we as an exec group had a hands-on experience of going shopping, buying, preparing, eating and we sat and we looked through it all.’

Mr Lewis also wants thousands of head office staff to spend one day a fortnight in stores over Christmas

As another part of his overhaul of company culture, Mr Lewis wants thousands of staff at the head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, to spend one day a fortnight in stores in the run-up to Christmas.

He explained: ‘I’m trying to get the business to make time for and think about – if they weren’t doing already – the things that matter from a customer point of view ... service, availability, quality.’
