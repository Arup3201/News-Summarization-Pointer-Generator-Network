Members of a Conservative social club have spoken out after the premises were apparently rented out to a group of swingers.

One woman resigned from Bridgend Conservative Club after the raunchy events came to light, saying: 'They are making money from social sex.'

After the meetings, swingers took to a sex website to boast that they had 'played in view of everyone', while organisers warned them to be more subtle about their activities.

Controversy: The Bridgend Conservative Club allegedly hosted meetings of a swingers' group

Group: Swingers took to a website to boast about their activities during the meetings

Members of Fab Swingers, a website with the motto 'by swingers, for swinging, for free', claim they held events at the club in South Wales in October and again last Saturday.

The organiser of the parties wrote online: 'We must all behave. Everyone who played in view of everyone at the last is skating on thin ice at this next one and that's including myself!!!'

She later added: 'Just to remind everyone there is no play on the premises and no fighting.

'Take it outside if there is a problem and if there is any fighting I won't hold another social and it will be spoilt for everyone else.

'The same goes for not playing, I know I was no angel last time but I fully intend to set a good example to all this time!!!!'

Function room: The club often hires out its rooms for private parties and claimed there had been no 'inappropriate' activities taking place

Messages: Users later boasted about their exploits at the evenings, which took place in October and last week

Another user suggested a string of sex-themed games with explicit names such as 'Give us a boob'.

David Morris, a spokesman for the club, insisted that 'no inappropriate behaviour' had been reported by staff or seen on CCTV on the two nights in question.

'The club can confirm that on the evenings October 26 and December 14 the club's function room was hired for private events,' he said.

'The club has CCTV cameras which cover the function room and can confirm that no inappropriate behaviour was picked up by the club's CCTV system or seen by any employee on duty during the night.

Anticipation: Another explicit message sent out by the users of a swinging webiste

'All private events which take place on the club's premises must be approved by the committee prior to taking place and no problems or complaints were reported in relation to the function which took place in October.

'The club's rules prohibit any inappropriate behaviour taking place on the club's premises.'

Mr Morris added that the club's committee 'are not aware why these allegations have been made'.

A spokesman for the Association of Conservative Clubs said: 'We have been made aware of allegations relating to a private event held at the Bridgend Conservative Club.

'It appears the club's function room was privately hired and we understand that this was a non-member event. In light of these allegations we shall be contacting the club's committee.'

The Welsh Conservatives said there was no formal connection between the club and the party.
