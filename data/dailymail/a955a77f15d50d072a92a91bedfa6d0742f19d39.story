Polished Chrisley Knows Best star Julie Chrisley grew up in a trailer and had two children out of wedlock it has emerged.

A source told RadarOnline that the 41-year-old mother-of-five from Georgia, who appears on USA Network's fly-on-the-wall show without a hair out of place, 'is hardly the Southern belle she claims to be' and is a 'totally fake.'

They added that she also did not win the title of Miss South Carolina in her teenage years as stated in the show and 'it’s total BS.' Indeed, on the Miss South Carolina website in the 'Hall of Fame' sections for both adult and teen entrants there is no Julie Hughes (her maiden name) listed.

All surface? Chrisley Knows Best star Julie Chrisley grew up in a trailer and had children out of wedlock it has emerged - in the show she takes on the role of a picture perfect millionaire's wife

Instead, Mrs Chrisley apparently grew up 'living the simple life' in a double-wide trailer in Winchester, South Carolina - a far cry from the 30,000-square-foot mansion she lives in now.

She shared the cozy abode with her parents, who worked as a mechanic and bank teller, and her brother who reportedly committed suicide a the age of 25.

However, Mrs Chrisley escaped the trailer lifestyle after meeting her millionaire husband Todd - who was still married at the time - in the early Nineties.

It was a whirlwind relationship and she soon fell pregnant, having two children - Lindsie and Kyle - out of wedlock.

Following his divorce, Radar reports that Mr Chrisley married a heavily pregnant Mrs Chrisley on May 25, 1996. She gave birth to their third child, Chase, just a week later.

Mr Chrisley went on to become very successful in the real estate business and made millions.

However, over the years he ran up massive debts and was forced to file for bankruptcy. He allegedly owes the banks around $49million.

This is news that emerged only after Chrisley Knows Best made its TV debut this March.

On the show
 the Chrisleys maintain a picture perfect image, rambling around their 
enormous mansion, and do not mention their financial woes. 

Picture perfect: The Chrisley's lavish lifestyle is the subject of the hit reality show Chrisley Knows Best - but it could come to an end due to financial woes

In one episode Mrs Chrisley muses, while dressed in designer clothes and expensive-looking jewelry: 'I love beautiful things. We saw this house and I said "oh my gosh I would love to have it" and [Todd] made it happen . . .  It's been a great place for the children.

'When it comes to what truly matters, I got it all I do believe.'

But the Chrisleys’ lavish lifestyle could come crashing to the ground as the banks are now knocking on the door and a bankruptcy case is in motion.

Due to its popularity, a second season of their reality show is due to air which will no doubt provide some financial relief.
