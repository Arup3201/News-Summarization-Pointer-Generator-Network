A Columbia University Dental School student who has been missing for more than a month has been found dead in the Hudson River.

Jiwon Lee, 29, was pulled from the water after a passers-by spotted a body floating off West 86th Street. She went missing on April 1, weeks before her graduation.

She had been suffering from depression and had attempted suicide at least once before she disappeared.

Dead: The body of Jiwon Lee, 29, was pulled from the Hudson River in New York on Saturday

Police told the New York Daily News 
that Miss Lee was wearing just a sweater, underwear and boots when her 
body was pulled from the Hudson on Saturday afternoon.

They confirmed the identity of the body yesterday and informed her next of kin.

Miss
 Lee had not been seen since leaving her apartment on Manhattan’s Upper 
West Side at around 8.30 p.m. on April 1, police said.

Her
 relatives said they believed foul play was involved, but investigators 
allegedly found a suicide note on a desk in the apartment written out to
 her family.

Miss Lee had previously tried to take her own life with pills, an NYPD official told MailOnline. 'She wrote them all a letter that it was not their fault, she gave up on life,' said the police officer.

Police are not sure how long ago the note was written, but do see it as an ominous sign.

Miss
 Lee last spoke with her brother and another person, whose phone number 
has since been disconnected, before she went missing, a friend told Gothamist.

The call lasted 
for half an hour until just before the last contact her phone had with a
 local cell tower, her brother Matt Lee told MailOnline.

The number tracked to Sacramento, California, and she had spoken with the person previously.

Well respected: Jiwon Lee was recently the president of the American Student Dental Association

Mr
 Lee previously said that his sister's disappearance was out of 
character. 'She’s never done anything like this,' he said last month. 
'we don’t think it is anything she did herself that has caused her to be
 missing.'

The five-foot-two, 120-pound student was last seen by her roommate at their West 98th Street apartment.

Police
 last tracked her cell phone to West 179th Street, near the George 
Washington Bridge, through pings from cell towers, her friend Kimberli 
Leal told MailOnline.

The 
phone last contacted that tower at 9.33 p.m., her brother said, adding 
that there was no reason he was aware of for her to be in that area.

He had said he was hoping her disappearance had nothing to do with the bridge.

Mr
 Lee lives on West 175th Street, and loved ones believed she may have 
been on her way to see him, but he was not expecting her, he lamented.

Police
 previously searched the area with dogs and divers but have came up 
empty. A review of bridge surveillance footage also showed nothing, but 
the police source said she could still have accessed the pedestrian 
walkway.

Investigators and 
loved ones spent days combing the area for signs of the missing 
part-time comedian. They also created a Facebook page to aid in the 
search.

A search of the harbor also didn't turn up any trace of the missing woman.

A
 group of friends had gathered every day to post signs in the areas 
around her apartment, where she went missing and by Columbia University 
Medical Center, said Miss Leal.

Before
 news of her death emerged, Mr Lee had paid tribute to his sister and 
begged her to come hom. 'She’s an amazing individual, very high 
achieving, very caring about others,' he said. 'We just want her to come
 home.'

Jiwon Lee had been the president of the American Student Dental Association, according to Jonathan Shenkin.

‘Jiwon is an exceptionally well 
respected leader in this nation in the dental community,’ he told 
MailOnline. ‘People adored her from the moment they met her.’

Missing person: Family and friends had conducted searches across New York for Miss Lee

Miss Lee had just passed her board exams and was expecting to graduate in May, according to Miss Leal.

The
 soon-to-be dentist wasn’t outwardly having any personal problems in the
 days and weeks leading up to her disappearance, Miss Leal said.

‘Everything was fine.’

The well-rounded student also taught math to middle school students in the city through AmeriCorps, according to the Columbia Spectator.

A GoFundMe
 site had been set up to help raise money to hire a private 
investigator. Money raised was also to be used to provide a reward to 
anyone who comes forward with information leading to Miss Lee.
