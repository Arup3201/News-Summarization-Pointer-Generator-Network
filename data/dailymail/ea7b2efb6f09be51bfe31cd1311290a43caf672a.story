Jade Bayliss was off school with illness when her mother's ex-boyfriend burgled the home, strangled her, and set the house alight

A convicted killer has been found guilty of murdering a 13-year-old British schoolgirl in New Zealand.

Jade Bayliss was strangled with an electrical cord by her mother's former boyfriend Jeremy McLaughlin before he set the family home ablaze to cover up the crime.

McLaughlin, a 35-year-old labourer, was found guilty of her murder this week as it emerged that he had previously been freed early from jail for killing a 14-year-old boy in Australia.

Jade, from Seascale in Cumbria, moved 
to New Zealand in 2006 with her parents Gary Bayliss and Tina Lawson, 
sister Amber and brother Harvey.

She
was off school with illness when McLaughlin arrived at the house to 
burgle the family's home in Christchurch on the country's South Island 
in November 2011.

His brief relationship with Ms Lawson, who shouted 'You b******' as the verdict was delivered, had ended a fortnight before.

He stole items from the house, pawning some and dumping others, before returning with petrol to set the house on fire.

McLaughlin
strangled Jade in her bedroom because she had seen him entering the 
house, the High Court in Christchurch heard. Her body did not show any 
fire-related injuries.

Ms Lawson, 34, said she approached police four days before her 
daughter's death because she was concerned about McLaughlin's behaviour in the wake of their split.

He had turned 
up unannounced at her home many times after they had split up about a 
fortnight earlier.

'He's a big guy and I just feared something possibly could happen,' she said she told police.

Jade Bayliss moved to New Zealand in 2006 with her family. In November 2011, her mother's ex-boyfriend Jeremy McLaughlin strangled her to death and set the family home alight after burgling the house

She
asked them what she could do to stop it 'turning into something else' 
and was given trespass papers to serve against McLaughlin if
he turned up at her home.

Ms Lawson, who separated from Mr Bayliss in 2008, was not made aware of her ex-boyfriend's previous 
convictions.

'If they could have told me I wouldn't have left her at 
home. I possibly would have been at home with her,' she said.

McLaughlin denied murder but admitted burgling and setting fire to the house.

His flatmate Jolon Sweeney, 42, admitted a charge of being an accessory.

After the trial, Jade's parents paid tribute to their 'beautiful' daughter, who was 'shy and social' with a close group of friends.

Ms Lawson said: 'Jade is a great loss to our family. This verdict will not change the fact that she is no longer with us. This is something we have been trying to come to terms with for the last 17 months.

'Jade was a bright, beautiful, bubbly girl, kind and loving and this is how we will remember her.

'We all love her very much and we miss her every day.'

Mr Bayliss said: 'There are no words to fully express how terrible the last 17 months have been.

'With this behind us, we want to remember Jade for the gentle, caring, funny and loving girl she was; not for what happened to her that terrible day.

'She loved her family and we loved her back - we miss her every single day.'

After the verdict, reporting restrictions were lifted to reveal that McLaughlin had been convicted of killing Phillip Vidot, in Perth, Australia, in November 1995.

Philip, 14, and his friend Tyron Williams had gone shopping but were battered with a cricket bat, run over by a car and then robbed.

Philip died hours later while Williams was in a coma for eight days and left brain damaged.

McLaughlin, who was 17 at the time, admitted wielding the cricket bat while an accomplice admitted running over the pair.

A jury acquitted them of murder, but found them guilty of manslaughter. They were sentenced to 12 years in jail.

McLaughlin served six years in jail before he was deported to New Zealand in 2001. He will be sentenced for Jade's murder on June 13.
