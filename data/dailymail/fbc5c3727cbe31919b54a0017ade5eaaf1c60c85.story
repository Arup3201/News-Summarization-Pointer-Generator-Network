Road trips always seem like a good idea at the time, but several hours of sitting in a hot, sticky car can be enough to dampen anyone’s spirits.

Now, a new gadget could mean drivers have a way to freshen up ‘al fresco’ - whether they’re travelling through the desert or stuck on the motorway.

The £125 ($210) system, named the 'Road Shower; provides a hot power shower using a 5ft (1.5m) long pressurised tank fitted to the roof of a car.

Outdoor adventurers craving a hot power shower can now have one by their car after an explorer developed a heated water tank to fit on the roof

When temperatures rise above 30°C, water inside the black aluminium casing heats up to a suitable temperature in around two hours.

Attached to the tank is 55in (139cm) hose, which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards.

The man behind the idea is Colorado-based Joel Cotton, who had what he describes as a ‘eureka’ moment while exploring the 120 mile (193km) White Rim Trail in Utah's Canyon lands.

Mr Cotton, 58, said: ‘We would ride into camp looking dusty, dirty and sweaty. 

Attached to the tank is 55 inch (139cm) hose, which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards. The nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower, jet and mist

The Road Shower uses the renewable energy from the sun which heats the black surface of the tank and warms the water inside.

The tank can hold five gallons (19 litres) of liquid. Once it is filled, users can pressurise the tank by inflating air into it using a bike pump - allowing it to project water up to 60ft (18m).

The nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower, jet and mist.

‘We would try using solar shower bags but there was nowhere to hang them, the water would drip out and it wasn't warm.

‘As a result, I've spent the last seven years developing a shower that heats up while you drive - and came up with a rack mounted pressured solar shower.’

The Road Shower has no solar panels but uses the renewable energy from the sun which heats the black surface and warms the water inside.

Currently, the Kickstarter Project is the only rack mounted portable solar shower on the market and for those seeking privacy, shower Mr Cotton said curtains can be sourced elsewhere.

The tank can hold five gallons (19 litres) of liquid. Once it is filled, users can pressurise the water by inflating air using a pump through a valve - allowing it to project water up to 60ft (18m). It even allows space for a bicycle rack to be attached

He added that if the temperature is below 21°C, it won't be very effective at heating water.

Mr Cotton, a retired computer science professor from Glenwood Springs, said: ‘People have given us some puzzled looks when they see others' showering.

‘But a full tank should be able to do three showers if you turn it off while soaping.’

‘You can also clip the hose to the side of the shower and turn the nozzle on so you don't have to hold the nozzle while showering.

‘Considering my first model was made from PVC, acrylic glass and an aluminium bike tray, it's come a long way.’
