A measles-like virus is being blamed for the death of more than 330 dolphins whose bodies have washed up on America's East Coast.

Scientists say that cetecean morbillivirus is the cause for nine times the usual number of bottlenose dolphins stranding on shores between New York and North Carolina since the beginning of July.

Most are dead by the time they reach the shore with many already decomposed and more than half of the deaths occuring in Virginia.

Dolphins infected by the virus typically suffer symptoms such as skin lesions, brain infections and pneumonia.

The virus is usually spread through inhalation of respiratory particles or direct contact between animals.

Officials confirmed that there's no risk of the virus being caught by humans.

Teri Rowles of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described the number of dolphin deaths as 'extraordinary'.

The NOAA announced earlier this month that the number of dolphins dying this year is above average and devoted extra resources to trying find the cause.

It had suspected that the virus was behind the extra deaths and has now confirmed it as the 'tentative cause' with research ongoing.

Officials believe that many more dolphins may have succumbed to morbillivirus but haven't washed ashore.

The virus, which affects a broad range of mammals, was the cause of some 740 dolphin deaths between New Jersey and Florida in 1987 and 1988.

The disease is expected to spread south and to last until next spring.

Eventually, dolphins will build up a resistance to the disease as they have been known to with similar strains in the past. A new generation of dolphins could become susceptible to the disease again in the future however.

There are two different stocks of dolphins that populate the affected region, with the northern stock having between 7,000 and 9,000 dolphins, while the southern stock has between 9,900 to 12,000 dolphins, according to federal estimates.

Bottlenose dolphins are typically found in groups of two to 15 and live for between 40 and 50 years.
