Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew admits he understands why Eagles fans are reluctant to attend Saturday's match at West Ham, insisting the club are determined to reduce prices for travelling supporters.

Pardew wrote an open letter earlier this week urging the Palace faithful to 'leave the sofa for this one' and the club lifted restrictions on how many tickets fans can buy for the televised fixture.

The game costs Palace supporters £44 for adults and £25 for concessions - prices Pardew admits are too high.

'We wanted to highlight the fact we hadn't sold all the tickets and the fact they're expensive and that I understand that,' Pardew said.

'I wish they were cheaper and I was asking the fans, if they can possibly afford it, to try to come along because it's a big afternoon for us.

'It's an agenda that we as a club are focusing on - that away fans should get a better rate to make it easier.

'With all the finance coming into the game, it's something that has to be looked at by the Premier League and by Premier League chairmen.

'These messages start with your fans. I'm just echoing my personal opinion with what our fans want and what fans up and down the country want.

'They want to follow their team, in a place where they have a good view of the game, and at a decent price that makes it viable to be able to travel.'

Palace captain Mile Jedinak is back in full training after recovering from a sore ankle 

After a blistering start under Pardew, Palace have endured a dip in form of late, having failed to win any of their last three matches.

The Eagles, who are 13th in the table, are boosted this weekend by the return of captain Mile Jedinak, who is back in full training after returning from the Asian Cup with a sore ankle.

'Mile is available but we've had some really outstanding performances in that midfield area so there's a bit of competition in there,' Pardew said.

'Nobody has a given right to play but he's important in terms of his captaincy and his presence.

'It's a big game, both teams need a win in the short-term so both teams will be very focused on victory.'

Palace are struggling up front, however, with Fraizer Campbell, Yaya Sanogo and Marouane Chamakh all out this weekend with hamstring injuries.

Pardew is hopeful Sanogo and Chamakh may return for the home game against QPR on March 14, but Campbell is likely to be out for five to six weeks.
