A 30-year-old man who allegedly laced his pregnant girlfriend's pancakes with an abortion-inducing drug, killing the fetus, has been charged with first-degree murder.

Scott Robert Bollig, from Wakeeney, Kansas, allegedly crushed up the drug on January 26 before giving it to his girlfriend, 36-year-old Naomi Abbott, who was between eight and ten weeks pregnant.

She later miscarried the fetus, but the Kansas Attorney General's office would not say when. Authorities also did not reveal how Abbott learned that she had been poisoned.

On Wednesday, Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed formal criminal charges against Bollig, who was arrested February 20. His bond was set at $500,000.

Charged: Scott Bollig, left, allegedly crushed up abortion-inducing drugs and gave them to his girlfriend, Naomi Abbott, right, who was eight to ten weeks pregnant. The fetus was killed, authorities said

'Bolling did, then and there, unlawfully, feloniously and intentionally commit an overt act, to wit: putting a crushed form of a medication used to terminate an intrauterine pregnancy on food,' charging documents state.

The complaint, which does not name the medication that was used or how it was obtained, says Abbott suffered 'great bodily harm' following Bollig's alleged actions.

A spokesman for the attorney general's office said only the information in the complaint would be released.

Prosecutors will also ask the jury to consider charges of attempted murder in the first degree, aggravated battery and distribution of adulterated food.

Bollig's lawyer, Daniel Walter, told the Salina Journal that he could not discuss any more specifics about the case, but said that he intends to challenge the law used to charge his client.

While authorities have not revealed the drug Billig used to induce Abbott's abortion, other recent cases have involved Misoprostol, also known by its commercial name, Cytotec.

Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies.

It is about 88 per cent effective up to eight weeks gestation, and is believed to be a cheaper and less invasive alternative to surgical abortion, if taken early enough.

The statute, Alexa's Law, allows prosecutors to charge someone with murder, manslaughter or battery for intentionally harming a fetus.

Under the law, when a pregnant woman is attacked, prosecutors can charge the assailant with a crime against the woman and a separate crime against the baby, but the law excludes abortion.

It is not clear how long the couple had been dating but Abbott, who has two sons from a previous relationship, divorced just over a year earlier, according to records.

She is listed as a witness in the complaint, along with Kansas Bureau of Investigation agents, registered nurses and bank and post office workers.

Trego County Sheriff Richard Hanks confirmed that Abbott is an employee in his office so although the crime allegedly occurred there, it is being dealt with by a neighboring county, Hays.
