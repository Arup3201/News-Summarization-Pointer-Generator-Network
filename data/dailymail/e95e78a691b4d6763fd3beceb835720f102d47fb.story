Sir George Castledine arriving at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. He is accused of telling an 85-year-old widow he needed to get fit so he could 'make love' to her

A professor knighted for his role in nursing was caught talking about having sex with an 83-year-old patient who he borrowed thousands of pounds from, a disciplinary panel was told today.

Sir George Castledine, one of the country's most eminent nursing experts, allegedly told the woman who went to see him for bereavement counselling that he had to go to the gym or he 'wouldn't be able to make love' to her.

The married father of three is alleged to have tried to get the son of the woman, known as Patient A, to sign a 'do not resuscitate' notice and to have accepted thousands of pounds from the pensioner who he nicknamed 'my little Tinkerbell', it is claimed.

The 66 year-old was recorded on tape telling the elderly woman 'I do love you, dearly' after one of her daughters became suspicious about missing money and began recording her mother's telephone calls.

The professor, who is only the second male nurse to be knighted for his healthcare work, is facing a string of misconduct allegations at the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

The alleged inappropriate relationship was uncovered in August 2009 when the pensioner's daughters began secretly recording her phone calls after growing alarmed at their mother's relationship with the nurse when he began showering her with gifts of flowers, potted plants and even offered to value her paintings.

The hearing was told the pensioner was illiterate and 'vulnerable' following the death of her husband in November 2008 after 59 years of marriage.

She was referred to Sir George for bereavement counselling at Onneley House, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health where he was also the chief executive.

Dr Mary-Teresa Deignan, representing the Nursing and Midwifery Council, told the central London hearing the 'defining moment' came when he attended a party with the pensioner celebrating the opening of her daughter's hair salon in September 2009.

Dr Deignan said: 'The panel will hear witness C describe the two as though they were two long lost buddies, they were sat facing each other. Although they were not touching or holding hands it was clear at the party they were very close.

'Witness C told her mother that she was very concerned about her mother but that her mother told her to 'butt out' or she would never speak to her, her sister, or her brother again.'

Her daughters said they were frightened of probing the issue further because they feared losing their mother and that she would end up 'on her own and decrepit'.

But in November 2009 their fears were fuelled when Sir George asked the woman's son if he would sign a do not resuscitate form for the patient- while telling the pensioner that it was in fact a do resuscitate form, it was alleged.

Dr Deignan said: 'The registrant said his mother was hoping to go on a trip to Torquay and it was practice to sign a do not resuscitate form and that anyone who wanted to attend the trip had to sign one.

'Witness told the registrant that he needed time to think about it and left the house without signing the do not resuscitate form.

Sir George denies the all but one of the allegations. He admits having further contact with Patient A after being warned not to

'When the issue was raised to Patient A she explained that she had understood that she had been signing a do resuscitate form.'

The hearing was also told that one of her daughters found her mother was giving Sir George money after finding two cheque stubs for a total of £2,500 in late 2009.

The daughter usually co-signed her mother's cheques, but these did not have her signature.

Dr Deignan said: 'Witness C will tell the panel that in 2009 she found a cheque stub for £2,000 that she had not written, and it did not say who the money should be paid out to.

'Witness C will inform the panel that she was aware that after her father died there was £13,000 in Patient A's home, but at the beginning of 2011 when witness C asked her mother if she could lend her cash to pay wages while she was away Patient A said she could only give her £5,500.'

Alarmed, her daughters began secretly recording their mother's telephone calls in August 2009 and were left dismayed when they heard him tell their elderly mother: 'I love you'.

Dr Deignan said one of the pensioner's daughters was so upset by the recording she 'was running around the house screaming.' adding that she had said 'it was just awful. I was so shocked it was almost like it stopped me breathing.'

'I phoned Witness C and said it was worse than I thought. I listened to the first tape but I couldn't listen to the other tapes, it made me cry. Mum sounds so distressed and upset.'

The daughters said they agonised over the decision to tape their mother's calls but felt they had no other choice because their mother's interests were 'paramount'.

Soon after hearing the recordings the daughters alerted bosses at the Institute he worked at about their concerns and Sir George was warned not to have any more contact with the pensioner.

Sir George denies the all but one of the allegations. He admits having further contact with Patient A after being warned not to.

He is a former assistant dean for the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University and a fellow of the Royal College of Nursing. In 2007, he was knighted for services to healthcare.

He faces being struck off if the allegations are found to be true.

The case continues.
