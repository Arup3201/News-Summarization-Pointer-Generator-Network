Manchester City have welcomed back star midfielder Yaya Toure to their pre-season training camp in New Jersey following a summer of speculation and accusations.

The Ivorian international has been a crucial force in City's recent success as the club has won the Premier League twice and FA Cup once since his arrival in 2010 but was heavily linked with Barcelona and PSG in the off season.

Last week Toure reassured the anxious Man City faithful, vowing to remain at the Etihad Stadium despite months of seemingly trying to drive a wedge between himself and Premiership champions.

He's back! Yaya Toure has finally joined up with the Man City squad after months of speculation

‘I
 want to stay,’ said the Ivorian midfielder. ‘I will always honour my 
contract. I don’t think about all this speculation.

'It’s a big pleasure 
to stay and enjoy the next season. The fans have always been good to 
me.’

His agent Dimitri 
Seluk, who had spent the whole summer manufacturing alleged conflicts 
with City, added: ‘Everybody can stop speculating about this.'

However this was not the case at the end of last season. Toure was apparently 'very upset' for City not presenting him with a birthday cake.

 Then it was also alleged that on a trip 
to Abu Dhabi to celebrate winning the Premiership, the club’s owners did not shake Toure’s hand.

Seluk
 then asserted that it was ‘50-50’ whether the midfielder would remain 
at City next season, even though his contract runs until 2017.

Toure,
 meanwhile, praised the squad and ambition of Paris Saint-Germain whilst also admitting a
 yearning to finish his playing days back at his former club Barcelona.

 Following
 Ivory Coast’s exit from the World Cup Toure suggested City did not allow him 
compassionate leave to spend time with his terminally ill brother 
Ibrahim, who died last month.

However this has been denied by the club, stating they understand that Toure has been through a traumatic period following the death of his 
brother and they insist there have been no rows between the player and 
the club.

Luckily for City fans it appears all is calm between Toure and City with the Premier League champions kicking off their title defence with a trip to Newcastle on August 16.
