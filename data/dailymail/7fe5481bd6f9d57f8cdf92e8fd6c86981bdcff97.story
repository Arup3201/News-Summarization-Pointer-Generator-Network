Police probing the death of a Saudi student in Colchester have now appealed for a man who may have followed the student four days before she was stabbed to death to come forward.

Essex Police want to speak to a man identified by witnesses as walking behind two women, one of whom may have been Nahid Almanea, near her home in the Essex town on Friday June 13.

PhD student Ms Almanea, who was in Britain to study, was stabbed 16 times and left to die on Tuesday 17 June as she walked along a quiet footpath near the University of Essex campus.

Police said the man, described as white, in his 30s, around 5ft 10ins tall and with short, dark hair, was seen to follow the women as they came out of a house in Stanley Wooster Way shortly before 9am.

They said he had a local Colchester accent.

Killed a week ago: Ms Almanea, captured here on CCTV on the day of her murder, was stabbed 16 times. Police today said they think she might have been followed by a man four days before she was killed

Followed? Police released footage believed to be of Ms Almanea walking past shops in Hunwicke just before her death. Today they said they wanted to speak to a white man in his 30s witnesses said followed her

Meanwhile 
in a new development this afternoon, officers sealed off a road less 
than a mile away from from where Ms Almanea's body was discovered after a
 knife was found near drains on Hawthorn Avenue.

Today's new appeal comes a week after student was murdered on the Salary Brook Trail in Colchester at around 10.40am.

Police are still looking to talk to a man seen on the footpath between 10.20am and 10.40am, shortly before Ms Almanea was found.

He was walking from the direction of the university towards the Greenstead estate, and is described as being aged in his late teens to 30, with very black, thick hair which was quite short and a two to three inch mop style on top.

He was clean shaven, of average build, tanned appearance and was not wearing glasses.  He was wearing baggy trousers, which may have been lightweight cotton, and a distinctive beige jacket.'

Officers 
are keeping an 'open mind' about possible links between Ms Almanea's 
death and that of James Attfield in Colchester three months ago.

Distinctive coat: DCI Steve Worron, of Essex Police, right, shows a picture of a jacket similar to that worn by a man they want to talk to in connection with Ms Almanea's murder

Mr 
Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and 
head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in the town's Castle Park.

Detective 
Chief Superintendent Steve Worron, of Essex Police said that police do not have evidence that the killings are linked 
or that a serial killer is involved - although it is the second knife 
murder in three months in the town, where the motive remains unclear.

He told 
MailOnline: ‘We remain open-minded about whether the same killer or 
killers might be responsible for both the murders of Nahid Almanea and 
James Attfield.  But at the moment there’s no evidence to suggest that 
that is the case.'

This 
morning officers issued a CCTV image showing a man in a distinctive coat
 walking under a lamp-post in CCTV dating back to the time of Mr 
Attfield's murder.

But confusion grew as this afternoon officers announced they'd ruled out the suggestion that he might
 be wearing a jacket similar to the Italian-style designer jacket worn 
by the man seen near Ms Almanea's murder scene.

Still searching: Detectives are also looking at a 
possible link to an assault on a woman in Colchester on Thursday, two 
days after Ms Almanea's murder

Police were pictured combing the area yesterday near where student Nahid Almanea was stabbed to death

Detectives
 working on the case went back to the scene today where they handed out 
leaflets and posters in both English and Arabic.

Mr Worron said: 'People living
 and working in the local area are the key to helping us find whoever 
killed this bright, young woman who was a guest in our country.

'The answers lie in the local community and we will find whoever did this.

'So far 
the support we have had from the public has been great. Every time we 
issue an appeal we have a surge of information coming through into our 
incident room.'

Meanwhile, police 
also released CCTV footage of a man caught on camera shortly after a 
woman was assaulted in an alleyway between Port Lane and Peache Road, in
 Colchester on Thursday.

Tragic homecoming: The funeral of Nahid Almanea in her native Saudi Arabia was held last month

Murder: James Attfield, 33, was stabbed to death in Colchester in March in an apparently motiveless attack but police are not linking the deaths

Back in March James Attfield was found dying after he was repeatedly stabbed as he walked through Colchester's Lower Castle Park.

The killing was described as 'one of the most brutal murders' ever seen by police.

A post mortem on the father-of-five's body took eight-and-a-half hours to complete due to the shocking extent of the injuries.

He was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and 
head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack.

Mr Attfield was described as ‘vulnerable’ by his family after he suffered brain damage following a car accident four years ago.

He was last seen in CCTV footage drinking at the bar of the River Lodge pub in his home town the evening before he was found dying. 

He left the pub at 10.09pm and, strangely, left behind almost three quarters of a pint of his beer. 

Police are still trying to establish what happened between leaving the River Lodge and when Mr Attfield was found injured in Castle Park, Colchester, at 5.45am the next day - March 29.

No-one has yet been charged in connection with his murder.

Now ruled out: This CCTV image is from March when police were investigating the James Attfield murder. Police initially thought the man pictured looked similar to a man seen near last week's murder scene but this afternoon they ruled this out following new information

Detectives
 said they wanted to hear from anyone who recognised the man, who is 
wanted for questioning by police in connection with the attack which 
took place around 9.45pm.

The man is
 described as being white, in his early 20s, and around 5ft 7in to 5ft 
8in tall. He was of medium build and had a narrow face and appeared 
unwell, and possibly had fair hair.

Detectives yesterday appealed for a man and a woman seen cycling close to the murder scene to come forward.

The pair, 
both believed to be in their 20s, were spotted on Salary Brook Trail 
heading towards the Greenstead estate at 10.45am on Tuesday, June 17.

The man is
 described as having olive skin, dark hair and is tall and slim, while 
the woman has long dark hair and was wearing a 'flowing pattern tiered 
shirt'.

Mr Worron said the cyclists may have seen Ms Almanea before she was attacked and may have even seen her killer.

More than 
100 police officers from Essex, Kent and the Metropolitan Police are 
involved in the investigation into Ms Almanea's killing, as well as 
profilers from the National Crime Agency.

Detectives earlier said they were looking into the possibility that she was targeted because of her Muslim dress.

Officers 
on Sunday drained a fishing pond and carried out an 'intensive fingertip
 search' of the area close to where Ms Almanea was killed.
