The big challenge for Mauricio Pochettino now is to ensure his first season as Tottenham manager doesn’t fade into obscurity.

There looks little danger of that on the evidence of Wednesday night’s win over Swansea.

Last week was one to forget following Spurs’ Europa League exit to Fiorentina and Capital One Cup final defeat by Chelsea.

Mason’s goal was his first in the Premier League and came in his 20th league game of the season.

Pochettino now must concentrate on qualifying for next season’s Champions League; that, after all, was his brief upon taking the job.

And his players refused to sulk after their Wembley heartache as goals from Nacer Chadli, Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend secured a vital win, though they were forced to endure a late Swansea rally.

‘We have a group of players whose mentality is to fight until the end of the season,’ said Pochettino. ‘I think in Florence and in the final we deserved more, but we have shown we are alive and growing.’ 

In front of a procession of Spurs legends, including Alan Mullery, Pat Jennings and Ossie Ardiles, there was a minute’s applause for Tottenham legend Dave Mackay, who passed away this week.

A host of Tottenham greats joined in a minute's applause for club legend Dave Mackay

The emotional tribute took place before Wednesday night's Premier League encounter

Tottenham and Swansea players join in a minute's applause for legend Mackay, who died on Monday evening

Mackay won the FA Cup with Tottenham three times, in 1961, 1962 and 1967

The sombre mood carried into the game. But with an outside chance of a top-four finish, Spurs tried to breathe life into their season in the seventh minute when Chadli sent a neat volley past Lukasz Fabianski from Danny Rose’s cross. Finally, there was noise emanating from White Hart Lane. That was quickly replaced by a stunned silence after eyes clocked Gomis, all alone, collapsed in the centre circle.

Both sets of medical staff sprinted on to attend to the stricken striker. Gomis received five minutes of treatment. 

Gradually the worried expressions lifted, a clear sign that this wasn’t as serious an incident as that of Fabrice Muamba’s cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane three years ago.

The incident only added to the subdued atmosphere, and when Ki Sung-yueng converted from a tight angle in the 18th minute, the decibel levels — but for a small corner of visiting fans — dropped further.

Spurs supporters needn’t have worried, though, as Mason and Townsend scored before the hour.

They were, though, forced to endure a hairy final five minutes after Gylfi Sigurdsson smashed home a volley in the 88th minute to set up a grandstand finish.

And Hugo Lloris produced a breathtaking save deep into three minutes of stoppage time to ensure Spurs returned to winning ways.
