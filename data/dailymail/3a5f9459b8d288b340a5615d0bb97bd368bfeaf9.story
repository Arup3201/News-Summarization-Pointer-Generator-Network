Since her Team GB Olympic kit was unveiled in March, the London fashion designer has been keeping a relatively low profile.

But last night Stella McCartney got back into the swing of things as she attended a pop art themed charity ball in the capital

Wearing an eye-catching swirl print dress from her eponymous label, the 40-year-old looked happy and relaxed as she joined a host of fashion friends including Agyness Denn, Natalia Vodianova and Naomi Watts.

And it seems the event was a great promotional event for the acclaimed designer, as a number of guests opted for pieces from her collection.

Both Agyness and Natalia opted for floor-length gowns from her latest range.

Agyness sported a gold-embroidered, short-sleeved cream dress paired with chunky, beige wedges, while Natalia picked a royal blue, strapless lace dress with a belted, peplum waist.

The charity fundraiser, held at Banqueting House, Whitehall, was in aid of the NSPCC Rebuilding Childhoods Appeal, which helps fund post-abuse therapy for children who have suffered abuse.

The first annual art ball - the Surrealist Ball - raised £2.8 million in March 2011 and this year over £1.1 million was collected.

After a drinks reception guests feasted on minted garden pea and truffle soup and roast halibut with Morecombe bay brown shrimps.

And a 'Pop' passion fruit mousse was served to finish.

Other guests to appear at the event sponsored by UBS, included actresses Naomi Watts and Rashida Jones.

Urban Caprice catered for the event while Boujis hosted the bar.
