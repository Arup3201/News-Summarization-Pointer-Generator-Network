A NSW state Labor Party candidate could be dumped just five days after being pre-selected after comments were published in which he appeared to warn female migrants about the risks of reporting domestic violence to police.

Susai Benjamin has the backing of ALP heavyweights for a seat in western Sydney but his candidacy has been called into question over an article that appeared in the Law Society Journal in March 2012, in which he said there was a misunderstanding among women who had recently arrived in Australia that police act as counsellors in domestic abuse cases.

'For example, some wives think that they can call the police, and the police will come and warn their husbands not to be violent, but instead the police, when they come, arrest and charge them,' Mr Benjamin said.

'This leads to a total breakdown of the family relationships.'

Newly endorsed Australian Labor Party candidate Susai Benjamin is facing a backlash over his comments on domestic violence

Mr Benjamin, a solicitor and barrister, is part of the Toongabbie Legal Centre in Sydney's western suburbs, a community-based legal centre which provides free legal advice and information 'to those who cannot afford to pay private lawyers and for those who do not know where to go when they encounter a legal problem'.

At first Mr Benjamin called the matter 'just a storm in a tea cup' and refused to recant the views he expressed in the article.

But on Monday, he told Daily Mail Australia that 'my position is that domestic violence is not acceptable under any circumstances'.

'It's just that for some communities we need better education about the role of police and how they act in terms of domestic violence,' he said.

'People should report domestic violence to police, no ifs or buts, but sometimes they are told they should not have called them about an argument and then it is too late to make alterations.'

Advocacy groups say Western Sydney has one of the country's worst rates of domestic violence

His reported views have caused dismay within his own party and anti-domestic violence campaigners.

Mr Benjamin's pre-selection for the seat vacated by former NSW Premier Nathan Rees was backed by Labor Party heavyweights including federal MPs Laurie Ferguson and Julie Owens, and State MP Lynda Voltz, who come from the party's Left faction.

Mr Ferguson, however, remains a staunch supporter despite the controversy.

'It's true that some cultural differences do not translate here and I don't agree with some of the comments he made,' Mr Ferguson said.

'Yes he could have chosen his words a bit better but while he said them (the words) he definitely would not practice those things himself.

'This is just an internal agenda issue - all part of a smear campaign by his detractors but he has been re-endorsed by the executive.

'He has very strong support within the rank and file.'

Mr Benjamin was pre-selected unopposed for the seat but has yet to be formally advised of his endorsement. He expects that to occur within the next day.

'With any political party, there are some people who vote for me, some who won't - that's the nature of the business, some love you and some hate you,' he said.

'There was the chance for others to nominate but I was the only one. It has been a four-month process and the party has come to the conclusion that I should be endorsed.

'There are people in the party who wouldn't like me to be the candidate.'

Karen Willis from Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia says Mr Benjamin's comments are 'out of step with the rest of the community'

Labor Party sources have confirmed that his candidature has gone before both the internal Candidate Review Panel and an Administrative Committee and they say he would have been axed had he not had the support of some of the country's most influential ALP politicians.

A party insider has told Daily Mail Australia: 'Just about everyone in the party agrees this (his pre-selection) is not a good idea.

'Several senior party members have made it clear they are very uncomfortable with his pre-selection on the basis of his views and want to get rid of him somehow without upsetting those who backed him in.'

Karen Willis from Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia said his comments 'are not in keeping with the views of the majority of his party colleagues'.

'More particularly though these views are totally out of step with the broader community.

'He obviously does not understand it is quite simply a criminal act, there is no excuse for domestic violence.

'What is of most concern is that he is seeking to represent an area which suffers some of the highest levels of domestic violence in this country,' she said.

This controversy comes just a week after drama gripped Victorian politics.

Liberal Party member Jack Lyons was forced to resign from his seat in Bendigo West after racist and sexist comments posted on social media were brought to light, while Aaron Lane stepped out of the running for Western Victoria after homophobic comments on Twitter posted by the endorsed candidate were discovered.
