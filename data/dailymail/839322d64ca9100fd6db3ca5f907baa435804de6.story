Apple was mocked following the launch of its large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones, with some critics accusing the firm of playing catch-up with the likes of Samsung and HTC.

And now the firm’s own co-founder Steve Wozniak appears to have sided with these critics, saying Apple should have released a larger, phablet-style much sooner.

If it had, continued Mr Wozniak in an interview with CNNMoney, the tech giant would have been able to steal a larger portion of the smartphone market from its rivals over the past three years.

Apple’s 64-year-old co-founder Steve Wozniak (pictured) told CNNMoney the tech giant may have lost market share by not releasing a larger phone three years ago, to 'compete with Samsung better'

The 64-year-old said: ‘Tech is like a song. You can get all the details from someone else, but you're not sure you like it until you hear it for yourself.’

Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs during the 1970s, and was responsible for designing the Apple I computer. He left the company in 1987.

Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus were the first devices to break away from the firm's typical 4-inch displays on previous handsets.

They were unveiled at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino in September.

Following the announcement, rival HTC tweeted: 'Happy to congratulate Apple on joining the world of big screens!' The HTC One M8 has a 5-inch display

The iPhone 6’s screen rivals those on the HTC One and Amazon's Fire phone.

While the iPhone 6 Plus’s 5.5-inch display puts it in the same league as the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy S5.

An image titled 'Dear iPhone 6 users: Welcome to 2012', was then created by New Jersey-based Google+ user Ron Amadeo.

The image poked fun at the fact that many Android devices have featured Apple's ‘new’ NFC (near field communication) chips for swipe-payment since 2012, as well as keyboard apps, which were new to Apple devices through iOS 8.

Mr Wozniak also admitted he hasn’t been impressed with smartwatches, calling Apple’s model (pictured) a ‘luxury fitness band’, but added it is more distinctive than others available, and that he’ll ‘give it a try’

Elsewhere, Google launched its own mobile payment system, similar to Apple Pay, back in 2011.

Mr Amadeo placed the Apple iPhone 6 alongside the Nexus 4 and reveals that features such as the larger screen, NFC, third-party keyboards, widgets and cross-app communication have been around since at least November 2012.

During the interview with CNNMoney, Mr Wozniak also dubbed the Apple Watch a ‘luxury fitness band’ and said he had, so far, been unenamored with smartwatches.

However, he added that Apple’s version is more distinctive than others on the market and he’s ‘still going to give it a try.’
