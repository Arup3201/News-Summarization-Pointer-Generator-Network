Dead: James Lee Blackburn, 31, was found hanging in his prison cell on Tuesday morning

Ohio says a prison inmate has committed suicide, the third case of a prisoner killing himself in two months in the state.

The State Highway Patrol says the inmate, James Lee Blackburn, 31, of Trumbull County, was found hanging in his cell at Lebanon Correctional Institution early Tuesday by his cell mate.

The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction identified the inmate on Wednesday.

Blackburn entered prison in 2006 and was serving a 21-year sentence for raping a seven-year-old child on three separate occasions.

Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro committed suicide last week as he began a life sentence for imprisoning three women in his home for a decade and repeatedly beating and raping them.

Castro
was serving a life sentence plus 1,000 years for abducting, raping, and
holding hostage Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus.

The 53-year-old Castro hanged himself with a bed sheet on September 3.

He was being housed alone in an 
isolation unit for his protection, where he would be checked every 30 
minutes.Â 

Prison officials said he hanged himself with a sheet during a 
break between inspections.

The two guards Caleb Ackley, 
26, and 27-year-old Ryan Murphy, were on duty in the Orient, Ohio prison 
unit, where Castro hanged himself.

The men are currently on paid administrative leave until internal investigations 
by the department and a criminal investigation by the state highway 
patrol are completed.

Neither have any previous disciplinary notes in 
their files.

Death row inmate Billy Slagle killed himself in August just a few days before his scheduled execution.

Slagle, 44, had been convicted of murdering his 40-year-old neighbor Mari Anne Pope in her 
Clinton Avenue home, during a burglary.

He stabbed Pope 17 times
with a pair of scissors as two children she was babysitting watched.
