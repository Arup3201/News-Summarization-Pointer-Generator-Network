Ask any motorist and they will probably admit that they've been tempted to whiz up the empty hard shoulder when stuck in traffic on a busy road.

But one cheeky motorist in Russia who decided to bypass a tailback came unstuck - as he inexplicably crashed into a roadside barrier and became wedged on top of it.

The driver's unfortunate mishap was caught and camera with a fellow motorist posting the clip on YouTube.

Cheeky: The driver risks the wrath of other road users as he continues to jump the queue and pulls away from the car with the camera

Eyes not on the road: The driver apparently loses concentration and although he is seen to brake the car is already too close to the barrier

The driver of the silver Ford is seen driving half on the side of the busy road and half on a grass verge as traffic queues before roadworks.

It looks as if the driver is going to have the last laugh as he overtakes several vehicles and looks to be skipping to the front of the queue.

But in his moment of shameless glory, the motorist obviously takes his eye off the road for a second and crashes into a barrier.

Unfortunately for the red-faced driver, his car gets stuck on top of the barrier and he is unable to move.

One YouTube viewer was less than impressed with the motorists driving skills and commented: 'I love to see instant karma at work.'

The crash is hardly a surprise given that Russia is regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for motorists in the world.

Figures released by the country's road police in August showed that there were an astonishing 107,000 road accidents on Russia's roads in the first seven months of 2012.

Tragically, almost 14,000 were killed in those crashes with a further 137,700 injured.

The vast majority, some 12,150, of those deaths were attributed by police to drivers violating the rules of the road.

Around 24,000 crashes were blamed on the poor condition of some of Russia's roads.

In 2011, 28,000 people died on Russian roads in around 200,000 accidents.
