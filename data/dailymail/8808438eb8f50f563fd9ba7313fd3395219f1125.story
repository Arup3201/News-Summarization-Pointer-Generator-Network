Everton have cancelled a supporters’ day trip package to Russian city Krasnodar after a lack of interest.

Roberto Martinez’s team take on FC Krasnodar on October 2 in their second Europa League Group H fixture and proposals for fans wanting to go to the game were revealed last week.

But the club have now withdrawn the day trip package for the clash in Russia after numbers failed to meet the 'minimum requirement'.

Cancelled: Everton have scraped a supporters' day trip to FC Krasnador 

An Everton spokesman said: 'It is with regret we have had to cancel the trip. Any supporter who had applied will be written to directly to inform them that their application has failed. Please do note that no monies will be taken from your account.'

The day trip packages are being offered in association with Everton’s travel partners Thomas Cook.

New territory: Toffees boss Roberto Martinez is embarking on his season in Europe as a manager 

Trips for the other two away Toffees' away game - against Lille on October 23 and Wolfsburg on November 27 - are going ahead as planned.

Everton are back in Europe for the first time in five years after finishing fifth in the Premier League last season.
