It is a rebrand aimed at helping students track down a university's website more quickly.

But Newcastle University's attempts to trademark a rather rude word as part of an image change might just leave those students somewhat offended.

According to City AM, the university has attempted to patent the Central University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

Rebranding? The University of Newcastle has reportedly applied for several rather unfortunate patents

The name could cause offence if, as so many educational institution's names are, the university is known in its unpublishable acronym form.

The Tyneside uni has also reportedly applied to trademark the Civic University of Newcastle upon Tyne name.

A slightly more publishable acronym, but one that could still leave the uni open to much sniggering is RUNT, derived from a third name the university has attempted to make its own, the Research University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

But the suggested trademark that could land the university in particularly hot water is the idea it could become the NewcastleGateshead University.

Current name: The institution's current guise is unlikely to offend

That name is likely to offend people from both Newcastle and Gateshead, neither of whom are quick to welcome being associated with their neighbouring town.

A Newcastle University spokesman told HuffPost UK: 'We have registered these new trademarks to help students who may be searching for us on the web, particularly international students.

'They are all common variations that people may search for and they will simply help interested students find us quicker.'

An American high school raised eyebrows last month when students were seen wearing their new pride T-shirts emblazoned with the letters 'WTF'.

The students, from the North Pointe Prep High School in Arizona, insisted that the letters respectfully referred to We're The Falcons.

But some parents disagreed, with the letters more commonly used as a popular acronym for 'What the f***'.
