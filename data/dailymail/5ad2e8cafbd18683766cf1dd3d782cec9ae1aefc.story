The headmistress of a school for pupils with extreme behavioural and emotional problems has been critised for allowing children as young as 14 to take cigarette breaks.

Students at the Honeyhill pupil referral unit in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, are given 10-minute sessions twice a day to smoke under the supervision of teachers.

Headteacher Claire George said the practice helps the teenagers, many of who have emotional, social and behavioural needs which can not be met in mainstream education, to concentrate and encourages them to turn up for lessons.

Under fire: The headmistress of the Honeyhill pupil referral unit for children with extreme behavioural and emotional problems has been criticised for allowing students as young as 14 to take cigarette breaks

Pupils have to hand in their cigarettes at the start of the school day and are only allowed them back for the off-site breaks.

Mrs George said the children, some who have been permanently excluded from other schools, are only allowed to smoke after the unit has received parental permission.

However, Peterborough's Tory MP Stewart Jackson has called for the local authority to review the practice saying children 'should follow the rules'.

'Most reasonable people would be quite surprised by this,' he said.

'They are not adults able to make reasonable choices. They are children who should follow the rules.'

One relative of a child at the unit, who asked not to be named, said: 'I am outraged that this is allowed.

'I thought the school had parental duties when our children are under their care.'

Honeyhill caters for around 200 ‘challenged’ pupils who have difficulties in mainstream schools.

'Pupils who attend Honeyhill do so because they have failed, many more than once, in mainstream education,' said Mrs George.

'They are amongst the most challenged and challenging young people within the city and most have complex issues.

'Therefore
 our approach has got to be different to give them the best possible 
chance of getting an education which allows them to progress into 
employment or further education or training.

'For those pupils who do smoke, we have a clear procedure in place. Pupils and their parents/carers are asked about health related habits when they start at the school.

'Our approach is that pupils who already smoke on admission can, with parental consent, have up to two 10 minute, off-site, fully supervised smoking breaks a day.

'All pupils are required to hand in smoking related materials at the beginning of each day.

'We appreciate some people will not agree with this approach, but we have found it far more effective than simply banning smoking, which our experience shows us leads to pupils not attending school or absconding during the day to smoke.'

An Ofsted visit in December rated Honeyhill ‘good’ with outstanding leadership and management.

Peterborough City Council’s website says of the unit: 'The emphasis is on re-engaging through a relevant curriculum, gaining work experience and qualifications and progressing into learning post-16.'

Pupils at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke twice a day on school property until the policy was changed after outrage last October.

The headteacher had said the policy was aimed at stopping pupils leaving the school premises to smoke.

Neighbour Gary Wesley, 58, who lives yards from the school, today said he was 'outraged' that teachers were allowing teenagers to smoke.

'At that age those kids shouldn’t be smoking full stop,' he said.

'When I was at school if you were caught smoking round the back of the bike sheds you’d be sent to detention.

'I wonder whether the teachers are even interested in their health. That should be their top priority.

'I think the teachers just want an easy life.'

Hazel Cheeseman, from anti-smoking campaign Ash, said: 'We do understand that many of the young people in referral units are smokers and that managing this is difficult.

'However, we would urge the school to urgently review the policy of allowing smoking in the pupil referral unit.

'We would also encourage them to speak to their local public health team about more appropriate ways to support children who have an addiction to tobacco.'
