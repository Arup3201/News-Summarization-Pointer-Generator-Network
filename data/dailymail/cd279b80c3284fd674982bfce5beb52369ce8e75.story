Brits looking for a warm winter escape in Spain ended up trapped in their cars instead during heavy snowfall and temperatures which fell well below freezing.

Rescue workers dug through 16 inches of snow to rescue around 220 people who were stranded for up to 17 hours on roads in northern Spain yesterday.

These included around 100 British expats and holidaymakers who had only just arrived in Santander by ferry from Portsmouth when they became stuck.

Around 60 stranded travellers were put up in a gymnasium and a school in the small town of Aguilar de Campoo, north of Madrid.

Some were forced to remain in their cars, while others resorted to staying in the caravans they had been towing. 

Gwynn and Valerie Roberts, from Prestatyn in Denbighshire, Wales, were trapped for four hours when the A67 became blocked following Wednesday's deluge. 

After being rescued by local police, they took shelter in the village school in Aguilar de Campoo with about eight other British tourists.

The couple, who arrived in Santander by ferry, had been heading for Marbella when they became stranded.

Mr Roberts told BBC Wales: 'They told us it had been snowing and to be careful. We set off on the motorway and there was a bit of snow and ice – not a lot.

'As we carried on, it started again, really heavy snow. I have not even seen it like that in Snowdonia.” 

He added: 'Come to Spain for the winter sun, they say, and you get loads of snow.'

A fresh wave of bitterly cold weather yesterday hit 33 of Spain's 50 provinces, the meteorological service said. 

Local media reported temperatures of -15C (5F) and up 40cm (1.3ft) of snow.

El Pais reported hundreds of cars were trapped on the A67 and N-611 highways between Cantabria and Palencia, in northern Spain. 

The A67 motorway between Santander and Palencia is still closed between Arenas de Iguña and Aguilar de Campoo due to heavy snow. 

Police said that dozens of military vehicles and snow ploughs are being used to clear the area.  

The freezing conditions are expected to worsen today, with the coldest temperatures expected at the weekend, according the national weather service 

Authorities also warned of a serious risk of flooding in Catalonia, northeast Spain, and the Balearic islands while more snow and ice is expected elsewhere. 

The recent bad weather has already claimed the lives of two people.

A 70-year-old man died after his vehicle was swept away by flood water, while a skier was killed in an avalanche.

Local media reports said many schools in northern Spain were closed and numerous power cuts had occurred.

Thousands of children stayed home on Wednesday and on Thursday morning and around 5,000 homes in the Basque province of Bizkaia were without electricity after a power cut.
