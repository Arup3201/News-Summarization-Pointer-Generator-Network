Replacement quarterback Colt McCoy overcame a limping Tony Romo to lift the Washington Redskins to a 20-17 overtime victory against the  Dallas Cowboys on Monday, ending the home team's six-game winning streak.

McCoy, who started the game after filling in for a struggling Kirk Cousins last week, led Washington to a winning drive on the first possession of overtime with Kai Forbath booting the decisive 40-yard field goal.

Trailing by three, Dallas had one last chance to reply but failed to make it through the first set of downs with a bruised Romo tossing two straight incomplete passes to end the game.

Romo was taken out of the contest in the third quarter with a back injury but returned in the final minutes of regulation time to try and lead an ultimately unsuccessful comeback.

It was the second straight win for the Redskins  while Dallas  lost for the first time since the season-opener.

McCoy was strong in his starting opportunity as he tossed for 299 yards and put Washington ahead 17-10 with a seven-yard rush early in the fourth.

Dallas answered with backup quarterback Brandon Weeden, briefly taking over for Romo, who found Jason Witten on a 25-yard connection that sent the game into overtime.

NFL-leading rusher DeMarco Murray registered his eighth straight 100-yard running game for Dallas, compiling 141 yards on the ground along with 80 yards receiving in the defeat.
