High profile: Cheryl Hines and Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Riverkeeper Annual Fishermen's Ball in New York last month

Robert Kennedy Jr's girlfriend boasted about their relationship online in the weeks leading up to his estranged wife's suicide.

Actress Cheryl Hines posted Twitter messages that showed she had all but taken the place of Mary Richardson Kennedy, who hanged herself last week.

The Curb Your Enthusiasm star, 46, had appeared on Mr Kennedy's arm at galas and events held by Riverkeeper, the environmental protection group of which he is vice chairman.

And her tweets suggested she had also become close with two of Mrs Kennedy's best friends, sister-in-law Kerry Kennedy and the actress Glenn Close.

As the New York Post reports, she even told her followers about how she had been talking about sport with the Kennedys' youngest son Aiden.

A post from February 5 read: 'Rabid, unhinged New England zealotry by 10-yr.-old Aidan Kennedy has nearly turned me into Pats fan.'

Ms Hines deleted her Twitter account around the time of Mrs Kennedy's death - but by then the messages had already been archived by social media search engine Topsy.

While the actress was proudly telling the world about her new life with her boyfriend - the lawyer son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy - he remained embroiled in a bitter, drawn-out divorce case with his ex after they split in spring 2010.

Mrs Kennedy, 52, was struggling with debt and depression before she was found dead at her home in Bedford, New York.

These are the pictures which likely sent Mary over the edge  as it appeared Cheryl Hines was trying to hijack her life by growing close to her children, left, and even boasting about her friendship with Glenn Close, below

According to the Post, documents show she was facing a $32,000 lawsuit from American Express, though this was dropped following her death.

She was said to have found it 'humiliating' when her husband and children appeared with Ms Hines at the Riverkeeper Annual Fisherman's Ball last month.

The blonde sitcom star also went with Mr Kennedy, 58, to Glenn Close's birthday party on April 15.

Mrs Close had been firm friends with Mrs Kennedy and even sang at her funeral on Saturday.

That same day, Ms Hines bragged: 'I got to tell #GlenClose what an inspiration she has always been to me.'

It came shortly after she tweeted about visiting a restaurant where Mrs Kennedy used to take her children.

The post read: 'At Armonk’s Burgers & Shakes in Armonk, NY. So, sooooo good.'

Then, on April 28, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture of the couple eating with singer Jackson Browne after an education fundraiser, along with the message: 'Cheryl and Jackson were amazing on stage and off.'

A spokeswoman for Ms Hines said the actress's 'thoughts and prayers are with the family'.

Earlier this week tensions between Mr Kennedy and his late wife's relatives resulted in the Richardson family holding their own private memorial service after all but one of them stayed away from the funeral he arranged.

The service in New York City followed a legal dispute in which Mrs Kennedy's brother Thomas Richardson, a lawyer, tried to stop her estranged husband claiming her body.

But the judge ruled in Mr Kennedy's favour, also awarding him full custody of his children and the whole of their mother's $4million estate.

After just one of the Richardson siblings attended the funeral on Saturday, other family members and friends arranged a 'celebration' of Mrs Kennedy's life at The Standard Hotel in Manhattan.

At the 200-strong memorial, there was no talk of demons or sadness but only the 'light and love that Mary brought into a room'.

Her widower was not invited, and took their four children Conor, 18, Kyra, 17, Finn, 15, and Aiden, 11 to stay with their grandmother in Florida.

At the funeral on Saturday, Robert delivered a tearful eulogy which seemed to distance himself from any blame in Mary's suicide, saying she had a 'sadness that kicked her and chased her'.

He also said that his late wife suffered from depression long before her 1994 marriage and keery Kennedy said 'she struggled from the time I met her when she was 15'.

But Mary's close friends dispute this.

'Battling demons? That's hyperbolic language,' Carole Radziwill told People magazine. 'I didn't see anything close to that.

'She truly believed in the goodness of people. In the end that was her undoing.'

Another friend said: 'Mary did not have a history of depression. She became a troubled person because of the divorce.'
