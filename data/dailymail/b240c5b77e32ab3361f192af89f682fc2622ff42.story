A teenager has claimed that her 'controlling' ex-boyfriend punched her so hard in the stomach when she was pregnant that she lost her baby.

Brian Kerr, 21, was found guilty of assaulting 18-year-old Danielle Keenan and is facing jail after sending her a chilling message saying: 'I should have done more than hurt you.'

He flew into a rage after Miss Keenan found the courage to move out of their home in Glasgow and followed her down the street before grabbing her and spitting in her face, a court heard.

When Miss Keenan, who was 11 weeks pregnant, tried to defend herself, he allegedly responded by  punching her in the stomach.

'He punched me in the stomach and it was such agony. I cried out in pain,' she told the Daily Record.

'Soon after, I knew I was bleeding. I got home and realised I was heavily bleeding and needed to get to the hospital.

'When the doctor told me I was miscarrying, I broke down in tears.

'I couldn't believe the person who had treated me like this was the same man that had once said he loved me.

Kerr was meant to be sentenced at Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday but told his lawyer he was too ill to appear.

Miss Keenan decided to move out after he destroyed the home they were sharing, badly cutting himself in the process and dripping blood all over the floor. Pictured is Kerr's own blood.

The couple met through friends last year and three months later she realised she was expecting his baby.

Ms Keenan said he started becoming more controlling and would lock her up in the house if he went out and take her phone and bank card away.

She said he would lose his temper at the slightest thing and revealed that he destroyed the home they were sharing, badly cutting himself badly in the process and bleeding over the floor.

'He got so angry. As I mopped up his blood, I kept thinking I could be next,' said Ms Keenan.

He launched his vicious attack in August this year after she moved her belongings out of their shared house and even tried to lock her inside at one point.

'I stood up to him and got out on to the street, but then he just flipped. All I kept thinking was, 'my baby, my baby'. But I couldn't get away,' she said.

'I just kept walking and he grabbed me and spat in my face – it was so humiliating.'

She also claimed that Kerr started taunting her on Facebook after the attack calling her 'fat' and a 'slag' and saying: 'See you at the scan.'

When Miss Keenan replied saying she was bleeding, he said: 'Good, hope it hurts.'

She went to police the next day and Kerr denied grabbing her and spitting on her, but was convicted.

Although the charge that he punched her on the body was dropped, Miss Keenan is adamant that he caused her miscarriage.

Kerr's sentencing hearing will now take place next month.

Miss Keenan is hoping to warn other potential victims of domestic abuse not to ignore the warning signs that they are in an abusive relationship.
