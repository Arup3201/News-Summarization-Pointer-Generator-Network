A woman was knifed to death in a double stabbing after a row over noise at a house party descended into scenes compared to a Scream horror film.

Heather Dyer, 22, is believed to have 
been stabbed in the back after she and other revellers were confronted 
by neighbours about music blaring out of a flat.

Emergency crews were called to the property in St. Helens where a 25-year-old man had also been repeatedly stabbed but Miss Dyer was declared dead at the scene.

Sadly missed: Heather Dyer knifed to death in a double stabbing over noise at a party

The other victim, who has not been named, is in a serious but stable condition in Whiston Hospital.

Heather is thought to have attended the party held in an apartment in a  £90,000 terraced property when people became enraged at the noise going on late into the night.

Paul Lyon, 44, also of St Helens, was last night charged with the murder of Heather Dyer and the attempted murder of the 25-year-old man.

Lyon was remanded in custody to appear at St Helens Magistrates’ Court today.

Amanda Jones, 38, who lives opposite the victim, spoke of her horror as the tragic scenes unfolded in the street where she has lived for two years.

The mum-of-seven today told how she watched a man run around the street wielding the knife while the injured man stumbled to her doorstep after being stabbed. 

She gave the man a towel to help stop the bleeding and said his attacker was chasing after other people in the street with the weapon.

Mrs Jones said: ‘He started chasing other people around the street, there must have been about five or six people. It was like Scream, it was like a horror film. This is not supposed to happen on your own doorstep.’ 

The alleged attacker was eventually stopped by a group of people.

Mrs Jones said the 25-year-old male victim had been stabbed twice in the stomach.

Fun Loving: Heather enjoyed parties with friends

‘He came to my door step and asked me to phone the police. I gave him a towel to press against the bleeding, he seemed OK. Then he stood up and collapsed in the middle of the street.

‘I don’t know him, I have never seen him before.

‘Heather was stabbed in the back. I didn’t realise she had died straight away, she was laying on the floor.’

The neighbour said Heather would often play with her children in the street.

‘She’s lived here about six months, and we have been friends with her. She was great with the kids. She had been having a hard time. She was getting evicted, and she had lost her job.

‘I think she worked with children and the place is closing down.’

Floral tributes have been left near the home, one reads: ‘RIP Hev, Can’t believe you are gone, but you’ll never be forgotten.’

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She sometimes played loud music, mostly at weekends and was being evicted by Riverside.

Another added: ‘There was often trouble up that end of the street, but it is still shocking.’

One neighbour said: 'The noise was going on 
until well in the early hours.

'There was lot of a laughing and cheering 
and this incessant bass drum beat going on.

'We believe some neighbours had gone
to confront the party hosts about it but it seems no one took any 
notice and the party carried on going.

'The next thing we knew there was a lot of shouting and screaming.'

Another neighbour said they heard shouts of 'what are you doing' and 'he has got a knife' before all hell broke loose.

He said: 'There was a large crowd of people gathered outside when police arrived.

'It's such a terrible shock. Yes the 
noise was unbearable but it;'s not worth someone losing their life over.

'It must be a terrible tragedy for that poor girl's family.'

In a statement her family said: 'She was a fun-loving person who will be sadly missed.'

On her Facebook page, Heather dubbed herself 'Crazy Lady' and listed: 'Partyin with Mates' amongst her activities.

Police spent the day of her death at the house and a tent was erected at the scene where Heather was killed.

A spokesman said: 'Officers were called to the scene on Chapel Street just after 2.30am following reports of the disturbance.

'Paramedics attended and the woman 
was declared dead at the scene. A 25-year-old man was taken to hospital,
where he is being treated for stab wounds.

'His condition is described as serious but stable.'

A Home Office post mortem examination confirmed stab wounds as the cause of death.
