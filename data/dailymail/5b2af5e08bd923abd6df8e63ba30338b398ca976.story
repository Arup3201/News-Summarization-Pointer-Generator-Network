A notorious police killer has received more than £250,000 in legal aid, helping him to launch a string of ‘absurd’ human rights cases from jail.

David Bieber, 48, used part of the taxpayer-funded sum to sue the prison service on four occasions – even claiming that he should be moved to a more comfortable cell.

Last night the legal cost racked up by the killer was criticised as ‘ludicrous’ by the widow of PC Ian Broadhurst, the officer he shot at point blank range on Boxing Day in 2003. Speaking from her home in Lanarkshire, she said: ‘It is absolutely disgraceful that someone like him is allowed that amount of public money.

‘I genuinely don’t understand why after 11 years this is still going on. I am disgusted.’

Bieber, a former US Marine, racked up a £277,600 bill at the taxpayer’s expense, according to figures released by the Ministry of Justice. But officials say the total amount claimed by Bieber may increase even further as he is involved in on-going legal proceedings.

Figures, revealed following a freedom of information request, show the majority of Bieber’s legal aid – £236,620 – was spent on his crown court trial.

The rest, more than £40,000, was spent on civil claims about his prison conditions. He acquired some £23,782 in aid for pre-court legal work, while a High Court application for a judicial review cost £16,775.04 of public money. Another case that reached court used £420 in legal aid.

The size of the bill will once again raise questions about the ease with which dangerous criminals can access public funds, despite government reforms to cut the bloated legal aid budget.

Bieber was given a ‘whole life’ sentence – later cut to 37 years – in 2004 following the murder of PC Broadhurst, 34, who was shot in the chest and head after stopping the killer’s vehicle in Leeds.

The steroid-addicted bodybuilder and drug dealer, who was wanted in the US for conspiracy to murder and had fled to the UK under an alias, has been branded one of the most dangerous criminals in the country after trying to escape from prison at least four times.

But he demanded to have his ‘exceptional risk’ security category downgraded so he could be moved to a better cell at high-security Frankland Prison in County Durham.

He claimed his human rights were infringed. Mr Justice Mostyn, speaking during Bieber’s High Court hearing last year, described his crimes as ‘bestial’ and said his claim was ‘untenable’ and ‘absurd’.

‘Bieber has made numerous applications to the High Court about the conditions in which he is being held,’ he said. ‘All the claims have been funded by legal aid.

‘It is perhaps noteworthy that I have sat in this court, where I usually sit, with litigants in person before me – people who are desperate to see their children – from whom the Government has withdrawn all legal aid.’

Bieber’s legal team yesterday disputed claims that he funded all of his claims with public money as ‘factually wrong’, claiming he paid for one hearing himself. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘It is cases just like this – where a convicted killer has used taxpayers’ money on speculative court cases to try and challenge their prison status – that made me determined to make big changes to the system.

‘We have now changed the rules to ensure legal aid resources are only available when really necessary.’
