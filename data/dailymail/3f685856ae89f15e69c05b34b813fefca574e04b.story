A woman is in hospital with surgeons battling to save her arms after they were almost torn off in a savage dog attack.

The woman, a cleaner in her 30s thought to be from Eastern Europe, was attacked by two dogs from an unlicensed dog training compound in Great Amwell, Hertfordshire.

She was found by the owner of the land, who was renting out the property, covered in blood inside a barn.

Two men have been arrested and an investigation launched after armed police were called to the premises

When armed police arrived at the premises they discovered 99 dogs were on site, including the two Alsatians which caused the victim's injuries.

Among the breeds discovered were Bull mastiffs, Dobermans, Alsatians and Pit Bull Terriers.

A source told the Sun: 'The victim has horrendous life-changing injuries. Her arms and torso were very badly damaged.' 

Police have launched an investigation into the incident and two men, aged 20 and 27, have been arrested and bailed. 

The landowner, who did not want to be named, said two men running a company supplying guard dogs for security purposes had been renting the property.

He had driven to inspect the farm on Thursday but was shocked when he opened his door and a large dog, which he thought was German Shepherd, jumped into his vehicle.

He saw blood around his mouth and assumed it had been in a fight with another dog, until he found the victim.

'I came up here in my car and opened this gate and a German Shepherd came over and jumped in my car,' said the landowner, who is married with children.

'I just said "oi, get out". He had blood all over his face. I though he had been in a dog fight.

'Then I heard the screaming and found the girl in the little barn. She was in trauma.

'It was horrific, she was in a bad way and all I saw were her arms. That's all I can remember, I was in shock.

'There were two dogs that had got out. The one that came over when I arrived and another next to the girl.

'It was just lying next to her and she was screaming. There was blood everywhere.

'I took her into my car and then closed the dogs into the pound. I drove to the end of the lane and rung an ambulance but it took 45 minutes to arrive.

'I rang and asked if I should just go to the hospital but they told me to wait then they eventually came and took her away.'

The man said he thought the woman had been Eastern European. 

'She just kept saying "water" and "help me" over and over,' he said.

'I don't know who employed her or if she knew the guys. I don't know how she's doing either.'

The landowner originally bought the old stables to keep horses for his daughter but decided to let it out when she lost interest.

He said he still used a large barn and a container situated just next to the pound for storage.

The man said he didn't know much about the owners and said he had not been contacted by the RSPCA, which was today referring calls on the matter to police.

He added: 'I have rented this place out to some guys who had been keeping dogs here. I didn't know much about it at all to be honest.

Police using specialist equipment search the kennels at the site, which neighbours said had attracted complaints to the RSPCA and police on previous occasions

'They had been here about a year but it was getting to the stage where they were no good. I hadn't had any hassle but there had been a bit of trouble with some locals.

'We wanted them out for a while but there was nowhere for them to go with a hundred odd dogs there.

'It was all rented out to them and I didn't have much to do with it.'

Chief Inspector Gerry McDonald said: 'Officers are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding this serious incident.'

'A number of officers, including dog handlers and firearms officers are at the location as a precaution to ensure public and officer safety until we can fully understand what has happened.

'At this time we believe the scene is contained and that none of the dogs homed are currently on the loose, however we would ask members of the public to remain vigilant and avoid the area where possible until further notice. If you do see a loose dog in this part of the county please call the police straight away.' 

The isolated rural complex where the dogs were housed contained several outbuildings and it is believed the dogs were being trained for the security industry.

Yesterday the police searched fields next to the farm for evidence, while footpaths in the area were sealed off. Firearms officers and specialist dog teams were among those deployed to the site. 

One local resident said: 'There were stables up there until a couple of years ago when they moved the cages and the dogs in.

'Complaints have been made to the police and RSPCA. I know animal rights people have not been very happy.'

Hilary Lawrence-Tinsley, 57, lives across the road and said she had heard of complaints to the RSPCA.

She said: 'I haven't heard of any getting out before but there have been complaints to the RSPCA in the past.

'Apparently they don't live in very good conditions but nothing was ever done about it as far as I'm aware.'

Another resident, who did not want to be named, added: 'The only thing that bothers me is the barking. In the evening it can get quite loud.'

Police blocked off pathways to the farm. On a gate the RSPCA had posted a note on Friday referring to the 99 dogs.

Among the breeds discovered at the site were Bull mastiffs, Dobermans, Alsatians and Pit Bull Terriers

It said: 'The RSPCA would like to contact the person responsible for the animals to discuss their welfare. If the RSPCA does not hear within 14 days it will assume the owner has given up all legal rights.'

The pound has been left abandoned by police and dozens of kennels today lay empty following the removal of the dogs.

CCTV cameras had been fitted at the entrance to the compound and warnings about guard dogs were plastered on the surrounding fence posts.

Dozens of kennels had been placed inside wrought iron cages which lay in a square around a central empty space.

Fences fitted with plastic sheeting were also erected around its perimeter in a bid to keep the cages private from the fields that surrounded it.

A police spokesman said: 'The compound contains outbuildings and a significant number of dogs were found to be homed at the location. 

'Two dogs have been seized as part of the investigation and officers will be working with other agencies to identify the other dogs at the location and re-home them appropriately.'
