Tragic: Ashley Anne Riggitano, 22, leapt from a New York bridge

The best friend and business partner of a budding fashionista who jumped to her death from a New York bridge on what was supposed to be her 22nd birthday posted a Facebook rant allegedly targeting the young woman just hours before the suicide.

Ashley Anne Riggitano leapt from George Washington Bridge at 4.40pm yesterday into the Hudson River.

It is believed that earlier in the day, Victoria Van Thunen, who co-owned the jewelry line Missfits with Riggitano, wrote on her Facebook 
page: ‘Those who incessantly blame others as the cause of 
their issues should perhaps take a step back and reevaluate these 
situations. The common thread may be that “they” aren’t the problem, but
 rather that YOU are.’

Riggitano's Louis Vuitton bag left on the bridge contained handwritten notes singling out the five people who had made her unhappy, who whom she did not want at her funeral.

'All my other ‘friends’ are in it for gossip,' she wrote according to the New York Post.

It remains unknown if Van Thunen was among the friends mentioned in Riggitano's grudge list. Calls to her cell phone were no immediately  answered Thursday evening.

Riggitano also mentioned a man who she was not happy with, and although he was 
permitted to attend her funeral, she added that she hoped he 'gets what 
he deserves' when he gets there.

The newspaper reported that Miss Riggitano may have had a history of problems and tried to commit suicide at least once before.

Medication, including Adderall and Klonopin, was found in her bag, according to sources.

Adderall
 is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
or narcolepsy, while Klonopin  is used to control seizures in epilepsy 
and for the treatment of panic disorder.

Business: Ashley Riggitano and Victoria Van Thunen launched their business in May 2011

The newspaper reported that the people referred to in the notes appeared to be friends from college or work and that Miss Riggitano may have been bullied by her fashion friends.

Miss Riggitano had been working as  intern for the New York-based jewelry and fashion designer Alex Woo.

In a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Woo, who employed Riggitano as a part-time intern, said everyone in the company was stunned by the news of her suicide.

‘She always had a smile on her face,’ she didn’t look depressed,’ Miss Woo said.

According to the jewelry designer, Riggitano began working for the company on a part-time basis in January, and was only at work about two days a week. Woo said her goal was to learn about the fashion business.

Tell-tale sign? Riggitano was invited to a major trade show in January as part of Alex Woo's team, but called in sick and missed the event

Woo recalled that early last month, Riggitano was supposed to take part on a major trade show that the design house was participating in, but called in sick. A short time later, she took another sick day.

Woo added that the vivacious the 22-year-old had a distinct New York City style and always appeared put together, which made others in the fashion community embrace her as one of their own.

‘I think everybody were really sweet to her,’ she said. ‘She didn’t look like she was the kind of person who was bullied at all.’

The designer went on to say that in the short time that Riggitano had spent at the company, she always came in on time, and was happy to chat about television shows she had watched or the blogs she had read.

‘It was a really big shock to us,’ Woo said, referring to Riggitano's tragic end.

According to the site Cliffview Pilot, what makes the suicide even more tragic is the fact that Riggitano took her life on what was supposed to be her 22nd birthday.
