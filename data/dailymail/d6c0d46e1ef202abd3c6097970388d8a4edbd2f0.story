A 70-year-old security guard who risked his own life to stop a schoolwide stabbing spree earlier this year, saving the lives of countless students in the process, has been fired by the school district for being too old.

John Resetar, who is employed by Capital Asset Protection Inc., a Pittsburgh-area company contracted to provide security to the Franklin Regional School District, got the shock of his life on August 4 when he found out his job was being terminated and his services were no longer needed this school year.

Resetar got the news in a letter from Jeffrey Dahlke, Capital Asset's regional security operations manager, which read: 'Franklin Regional and Capital came to the conclusion that ... it is best ... to relieve you of your duties at the school.'

'What really upset me, more than anything,' Resetar told KDKA, 'is that nobody would sit down and talk to me and tell me to my face. You know, I had to get a letter that was three weeks before school.' 

'The way I was let go, I didn’t think it was fair, for what I did for the school.'

Tim Dawson, Resetar's lawyer, says they plan to file a lawsuit. 

Despite what the letter states, the school district said Resetar's termination was unexpected. 

'We had communication with the company and are trying to get more information, but it wasn't really in our realm of control,' said Mary Katherine Reljac, an assistant superintendent with the district. 

She said the school was surprised to be mentioned in the letter. 

Last April, Resetar became a national hero overnight when he helped to apprehend Alex Hribal at Franklin Regional High School after the teenage suspect allegedly stabbed 20 students with a pair of 8-inch kitchen knives. 

In the process, the unarmed guard was knifed in the chest.

Alex Hribal, who allegedly stabbed 21 people, wrote a note boasting of his planned kill spree, investigators said

The entire attack unfolded in less than five minutes, as Hribal allegedly ran wildly down the school's hallway, slashing away with knives.

'He was stabbed on a Wednesday and he returned to work the following Monday, after having a stab wound an inch below his heart,' Resetar's lawyer Dawson said.

'He's a young 70, he was a linebacker and he can certainly still perform his job,' he added.

Resetar worked in the school for nine years before he was told via certified mail that he was being dismissed.

Now, the man who saved the lives of countless students, is unemployed.

In June, Hribal, who is being tried as an adult, waived his right to a preliminary trial. His lawyer, Patrick Thomassey, plans to ask a judge to move the case to juvenile court, where Hribal would face incarceration or probation only until he's 21.

Capital Asset Protection has yet to comment.
