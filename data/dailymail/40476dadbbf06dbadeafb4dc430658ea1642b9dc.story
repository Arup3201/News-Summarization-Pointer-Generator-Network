A mother-of-two suffering constant pain from her huge KK bust has finally had reduction surgery, after being denied the procedure on the NHS five times.

Kim Mills, from Chelmsford in Essex, has dropped 11 bra sizes following the procedure, carried out free of charge at a private hospital.

The 32-year-old's large breasts caused her to suffer spinal arthritis, such was the pressure being exerted on her back.

But on five occasions the NHS refused to give Ms Mills the surgery she so desperately longed for.

A surgeon who heard of her plight offered to do the operation free of charge at a private clinic.

'I've got my life back,' she said. 'Finally without my huge boobs in the way, I can be the mum I always wanted to be.

The mother-of-two was offered the procedure free of charge by a private clinic after they became aware of Ms Mills' case. She said the operation, which took place in September, has changed her life

'I can't wait to do all the things I haven't been able to - I'll be able to pick my daughter up properly and run around without being worried about what my boobs might do.' 

Since the age of 14, when Ms Mills developed a large chest, she suffered painful back ache.

After having her children, she struggled to reach over her chest to tie her daughters' shoe laces or brush their hair.

And plagued by embarrassment at having such a big bust, she hadn't been in a relationship for three years.

After years in pain the breaking point came just over a year ago, when a friend asked Ms Mills to be her bridesmaid.

Despite being a size 14 on her bottom half, she had to search for a size 20 dress to ensure there was enough material to cover her top half.

Unable to find an off-the-rail gown to fit Ms Mills' chest, the bride had to change the style ideas for her big day, and buy a mis-matching outfit.

Ms Mills approached doctors to find out if she was eligible for breast reduction surgery.

They told her she would need to lose weight before she could be considered. 

The mother-of-two promptly embarked on a strict diet, losing five stone.

But her breast size didn't change, prompting the NHS to tell her there was nothing they could do.

Ms Mills eventually made five unsuccessful applications to her local clinical commissioning group, for funded surgery.

Ms Mills' huge chest caused her to suffer spinal arthritis, and pain for many years. She reached breaking point when a friend asked her to be bridesmaid. But when dress shopping they couldn't find a gown to fit Ms Mills' size 14 bottom half and size 20 top

She approached doctors to ask whether she was eligible for a breast reduction and was told she would have to lose weight first. She shed five stone but her breast size didn't change 

In May 2014 she was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine, and told if she did nothing to stop the onset of the condition she would develop a hunch and eventually be crippled.

Ms Mills found herself caught in a catch 22 - the only way to halt her arthritis was to exercise, something her doctor had declared her medically unfit to do.

Then in September her prayers were answered.

Cosmetic surgery firm Aurora stepped in and offered to complete the £7,000 surgery free of charge as part of their charitable giving commitment.

A month later Ms Mills was admitted to the private Baddow Hospital in Chelmsford, where surgeon Garrick Georgeu removed 8lbs of gland tissue.

The procedure saw Ms Mills' breasts drop from a size KK to a comfortable DD cup.

'My boobs have been big since I was in my early teens,' she said. 'Nothing I could do would change them - being pregnant, breastfeeding, losing or putting on weight - they just stayed at their whopping KK measurement. 

Ms Mills said her previously huge chest prevented her being the mother she wanted to be

'I would have starved myself if it meant slimming my boobs down to but even after I lost loads of weight they didn't change.

'People never looked my face first - all they saw was my boobs.

'And I gradually started suffering from horrific back pain. Some days it would be so bad I felt like I couldn't move.

'I've always worked and never wanted to let it stop me but it has been tough.

'Everyone at my job has always been supportive - I've had special orthopedic chairs to try and prevent the back pain getting any worse.

'But more importantly, I felt like I couldn't be the mum that I wanted because my boobs were always in the way.

'They stopped me from playing with me daughter and I couldn't even tie her shoelaces they were so big.

'Now I can do everything I want and I am so thankful to everyone at Aurora Clinics.

'I can live a normal life without the horrendous pain and embarrassment of having such huge breasts and I will forever be grateful to Baddow Hospital and Aurora Clinics for giving me my life back.

'Without their help I couldn't see a way forward, I honestly thought I was going to be facing a life of excruciating pain and endless embarrassment.'

Ms Mills' surgeon Garrick Georgeu revealed the Aurora Community Scheme was launched earlier this year, in conjunction with Baddow Hospital, to give back to the local community and Ms Mills was the first beneficiary.

He said: 'After meeting and hearing about Kim's struggle over the last few years to get NHS funded treatment, we all felt compelled to help her.

'The size of her bust was extreme and significantly affecting every aspect of her life, to the point that in her early 30s has already developed changes within her spine caused by this excessive weight.

'We hope that this breast reduction surgery gives Kim, a new lease on life, bringing about a positive change for her and her young family.'
