Celtic's elimination from the Champions League on Tuesday night was celebrated by Legia Warsaw after they were controversially knocked out of the European competition.

The Polish outfit mocked Celtic over their 1-0 defeat against Maribor after they were thrown out of the competition for fielding a suspended player during the second leg of their 6-1 aggregate victory against the Scottish champions.

Legia Warsaw decided to appeal against Uefa's decision but did not have any success - which prompted the club to take their case to The Court of Arbitration (CAS).

However their case was also rejected by the CAS which resulted in Legia Warsaw's bitterness towards Celtic.

Legia Warsaw chairman Dariusz Mioduski also decided to rub salt into Celtic's wounds by stating he thought 'the better team won'.

Celtic were on the verge of progressing to the next stage of the Champions League on away goals until Maribor captain Morales Tavares scored the only goal of the game in the 75th minute.
