The traders at the illegal market on the banks of the Xi River in Foshan city in southeast China's Guangdong province say they started drowning the animals to avoid 'distressing customers'. 

The traders said that people had complained about seeing the animals killed in front of them, and as a result had come up with the alternative to kill them humanely.

After a customer has chosen an animal, the cat or dog is put in a bag and thrown in the river to drown.  

Trader Ming She told local TV: 'We want to prove our customers that what we sell is fresh unlike some of the shops in town, but with no facilities to kill what we sell out of view, the best and most humane thing to do is to throw them in the water.'

He said that the animals died quickly in the sacks and added: 'It is a painless death, which nobody complains about.'

After ten minutes in the water, the animal is skinned and can be butchered in front of the customer or even cooked fresh and eaten straightaway.

Following the report on local TV, Foshan city council  announced that it planned to crack down on the market, as the meat could be 'unhealthy'.

Council spokesman Guang Kang added: 'It may seem as if the meat is fresh because it is alive, but the source of these animals is unknown and many of them could be diseased or unhealthy for other reasons and we would advise people to stay away from them.'

He added that inspectors would be visiting the market and closing down the illegal traders which were damaging the reputation of the city.
