A Southampton teenager who suffered life-threatening injuries in a racing car crash five years ago has passed his driving test on his first attempt.

Chris Stewart, 17, cheated death when he suffered an 'internal decapitation' as a junior racing driver  when his car slammed into a barrier at high speed during a race.

The horrific crash wrenched his skull from the top of his spine and the teenager 'should have been killed'.

Chris, then 12, was rushed to hospital where doctors operated for six hours, saving the youngster's life was saved.

Specialists performed ground-breaking surgery called occipital-cervical fusion to re-attach his head to his top vertebrae with metal plates and bone-grafts.

And after 19 days in intensive care he stunned medical experts by cheating death and making a miracle full recovery.

But Chris is remarkably behind the wheel again after passing his test first time and with just five minor faults.

Once he has full insurance Chris will be driving round in a classic Mini Cooper which he restored himself.

His choice of car is extremely brave 
given that it was a Mini in which he suffered his horrendous crash but said it was what he wanted to do.

Mum Debra Cornell, 46, from Fareham near 
Southampton, Hampshire, said: ‘I'm fine with him driving.

'I didn't think
I would be but I am.

‘I told the consultant who first operated on him that Chris had passed his test and he was absolutely delighted, he was really chuffed.

‘That Chris can do something like this is a real testament to everyone who's helped him along the way.’

Chris has just passed his first year at Highbury College in Portsmouth and is looking forward to being able to drive to college.

He said: ‘I was a bit nervous the first time I went out, but after that was fine.

‘I found it a bit difficult to adjust from a racing style, but I was fairly confident about my ability to pass.’

His driving instructor Claire Perkins, of 1st PDS, said: ‘Debbie called me up about getting Chris some lessons, but then said "there's something you need to know".

‘He was quite quiet at first, but then his cheeky side came out.

‘Where he was used to racing, he had problems with his mirrors and using anything above second gear.

‘But he got there, he was challenging but in a good way.’
