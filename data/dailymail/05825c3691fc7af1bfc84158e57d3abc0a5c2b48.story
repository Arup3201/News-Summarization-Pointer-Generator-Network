These incredible photographs show the remarkable difference a month has made to the flood-hit areas of Somerset which were brought to a standstill when unprecedented amounts of rain battered the region.

Homes, farms, roads and businesses were left submerged in several feet of floodwater following the wettest January in southern England since records began in 1766.

Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate their homes and members of Britain’s armed forces were brought in after whole communities were hit by the deluge.

Now, after a couple of weeks of drier weather and warm sunshine, the floodwaters have started to recede and those worst affected in the Somerset Levels are starting to get back on their feet.

Homes which were half-filled with floodwater a month ago are now drying out – although many remain empty – and main roads which were impassable last month are now back in use.

Somerset County Council warned the cost of the damage is 'likely to be several million pounds' but said the full extent of the devastation is still being counted.

Properties in the village of Moorland, pictured, were severely flooded at the beginning of this year following the wettest January in southern England since records began in 1766. This photograph, taken on February 18, shows cars and homes underwater shortly after families were forced to evacuate their homes due to the deluge

Houses in Moorland, pictured, which were submerged in floodwater last month are finally drying out. These latest photographs show how the floodwater has subsided thanks to the drier weather over the last couple of weeks

Last month, the A361 at Burrowbridge - one of the main roads through Somerset - was completely impassable due to several feet of floodwater, pictured. It was closed to the public on December 31 and more than 30 tonnes of sandbags were brought in to stem the flow of the flooding

This week, the A361 at Burrowbridge looks remarkably different, pictured. The main road reopened to the public on Friday evening after being shut for nearly three months. A huge clean-up operation was carried out last week to remove fallen trees, used sandbags and damaged vegetation from the carriageway

Gardens were completely submerged and walls trashed after severe flooding hit the Somerset Levels at Christmas. Properties in Moorland, pictured, were evacuated months ago and families have been forced to stay in nearby holiday homes or with friends and family while waiting for the floodwater to recede

Today, the floodwater has finally receded from many of the properties in Moorland, pictured. These photographs show the extent of the damage caused by what has been described as the worst flooding in Britain in living memory

A white car parked in front of a garage in the village of Moorland, Somerset, is nearly completely submerged in floodwater on February 18. It is surrounded by debris and deluge caused by the winter's fierce storms

What a difference a month makes: The same white car which was seen submerged in floodwater in February is now drying out in front of a garage block in the village of Moorland, Somerset. Many residents of the Somerset Levels have struggled to receive insurance pay-outs for the damage caused by this year's floods

Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate their homes in Moorland, Somerset, pictured at the beginning of the year. Members of Britain's armed forces were even brought in to help rescue those affected and lend their support with pumping out the floodwater after whole communities were hit by the deluge

Now, after a couple of weeks of drier weather and warm sunshine, the floodwaters have started to recede and those worst affected Moorland, Somerset, are starting to get back on their feet. Authorities have warned the cost of the damage is a multi-million pound figure - although the full extent of the devastation is still being counted

Homes, cars, farms, roads and businesses were left submerged in several feet of floodwater following the wettest January in southern England since records began in 1766. A red car, parked outside a property in Moorland, Somerset, pictured, sits in deep floodwater in February

Today, the same red car, pictured, is positioned carefully on blocks while it dries out in the March sunshine. It is hoped the warmer weather will now help residents in Somerset get back on their feet and allow their homes, cars and belongings to dry out from the winter's unprecedented rainfall

A headstone in the graveyard of the church in the village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels is submerged in floodwater in February. Large swathes of Somerset were brought to a standstill when unprecedented amounts of rain battered the region over the winter months

The sun shines on a headstone in the graveyard of the church in the centre of Moorland, Somerset, pictured. Last month, the headstone covered in floodwater - a stark contrast to how it looks this week now the sun and warm weather has allowed the flooding to recede and the ground dry out
