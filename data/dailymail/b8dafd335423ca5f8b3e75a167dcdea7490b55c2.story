A yoga instructor fell to his death while he climbed alone in Yosemite National Park on Saturday - just after his girlfriend had accepted his proposal.

Hours before tragedy struck, Brad Parker, a 36-year-old veteran rock climber and fitness fanatic, had climbed to the summit of Cathedral Peak to propose to his girlfriend Jainee Dial.

'This is the happiest day of my life,' he told Dial, his father Bill told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.

Shortly after, the pair separated and Parker ran three miles to climb along Matthes Crest alone and without ropes. Climbers saw him fall from the granite crest, which reaches 500ft tall, around 5.45pm.

Park rangers hiked to the area and found his body, but were forced to stay with it overnight because it was too late to get a helicopter, authorities told the Press Democrat.

His body was carried out on Sunday morning.

The experienced climber, surfer and mountain biker from Sebastopol was remembered as a go-getter, who traveled the world for two years after graduating from Cal Poly.

Friends and family said they are shocked by the sudden death of the beloved man.

He was 'an 
amazing human being,' said friend Sarah McKay, who owns a climbing 
center in Santa Rosa. 'Eternally positive... His whole life was about 
getting out and enjoying the world.'

His
 parents, Bill and Gayle Parker, flew to California from their home in 
Kauai on Sunday to begin making arrangements to have their son's body 
cremated.

Afterwards,
 they will spread some of his ashes at Yosemite, while they will take 
others to the Pacific Ocean along the Sonoma Coast and the ocean around 
Kauai, where the parents recently moved.

They are not viewing their son's body, as suggested by others who have witnessed climbing deaths. 

'We're all so stunned,' Mr Parker said. 'What happened is so unbelievable.'

He added that he believes his son could have been tired after climbing Cathedral Peak and then running to the Crest.

Active: Parker, pictured right with his brother Mat, was an experienced climber, mountain biker and surfer

Missed: Parker, pictured left with Mat right, will be cremated and his ashes will be spread in Yosemite and in the ocean, his family said. They will also be hiking out to the park in a bid to get some closure

Scene: Parker was climbing this area of the park, known as Matthes Crest, alone when he fell on Saturday

The family, including Brad Parker's brother, Mat, are hiking to the Cathedral Peak area with two friends in a bid to get some closure.

On Monday evening, Dial shared an image of her grinning beside Parker to Facebook, and loved ones passed on their condolences, calling him 'the greatest guy'. 

Parker's death was the second climbing fatality in Yosemite this year. Authorities said there are usually one or two deaths there a year.

Matthes Crest, where Parker died, is a knife-ridge is not thought to be a technically difficult route; Backpacker.com says that some features 'make for ladder-like, easily protected climbing'.
