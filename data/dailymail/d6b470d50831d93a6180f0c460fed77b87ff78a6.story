A photographer was left 'all shook up' after spotting the face of Elvis on the back of a bug.

With markings on its back resembling human eyes, nose, mouth and a pompadour hairdo, the unusual stink bug bears an uncanny resemblance to the King of rock 'n' roll.

Photographer Darlyne Murawski from Massachusetts, US spotted the Pentatomoidea bug, also known as a giant shield bug, by chance.

The Pentomid bug spotted in a forest in Thailand. The insect bears an uncanny resemblance to Elvis.

The unusual stink bug bears an uncanny resemblance to the King of rock n roll.

Darlyne was on a photographic assignment with National Geographic in the Khao Chong Forest Reserve in southern Thailand, when she came across the unusual creature sitting on a leaf.

She said: 'The instant I saw it, I did a double-take.

I immediately thought of Elvis Presley with his pompadour hairdo and quickly pulled out my camera.

'Thank goodness it didn't fly away.

'I later found out that 'Elvis' was a giant shield bug, related to the stink bug family.

'It is found in Southeast Asia and I would guess it's uncommon since so many people hadn't seen it before.

'I was in the area for about three weeks, but sadly didn't encounter Elvis in the woods again.'

The bug has previously been spotted in the forests of Singapore, where it was likened to the Sesame Street character Bert.

There, it was captured by Winston Jansen, an amateur photographer who lives in the country.

After passing hundreds of other 
insects in  the  forest, this bug caught Mr Jansen's eye due
 to its 'stunning colour and intricate camouflage'.

Spotting the insect he quickly picked up his camera to 
get up close - and discovered the face of the TV character branded across its back.

Winston, 32, 
said: 'I was simply in awe at the beauty of the camouflage - I know many
 insects use it to avoid being preyed upon but I'd never seen anything 
like it before.

'I was just captivated by the bright colours.

'Then on closer inspection it just hit me there is actually a face on its back.

Usually found in Southeast Asia, the Pentatomoidea bug is also known as a giant shield bug.

Shield bugs have glands in their thorax between the first and second pair of legs which produce a foul smelling liquid to deter predators.

Winston, a banker from Singapore, first picked up a camera in 2009 and specialises in macro photography - a unique skill revealing details hidden in normal photography.

He was visiting the forests specifically to shoot insects on a macro photography trip.

He
 added: 'It was about midday, I chanced upon this stink bug and 
fortunately it was actually quite co-operative so I managed to take a 
number of shots at different angles.

'I'd had a few insects scurry away earlier that day - but there was no way this one was getting away.'

'After I shot this bug I did some research when I got home and found out there are so many more variations of this species.

'I'm still hoping I will be able to capture more variations of it.'

Sesame Street's Bert has entertained millions of children during his time on the show and has a fondness for number six and the tuba
