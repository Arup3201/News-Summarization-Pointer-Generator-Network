One of Spain's most wanted men whose Basque terrorist cell was behind a murderous bomb attack that left 12 police officers dead and 60 people injured appeared in a British court today.

ETA member Antonio Troitino, 55, has been convicted of 22 murders and was originally jailed for 2,232 years for the terror attack - but because of legal restriction released after just 24 years.

His release caused outrage and just days later his licence was revoked and he was recalled to prison - but he had already fled. 

Antonio Troitino Arranz, left, has been convicted of 22 murders, and Ignacio Lerin Sanchez, right, is 
considered one of ETA’s most dangerous terrorists. The pair appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court

After more than a year on the run he 
was arrested in a dawn raid in Hounslow, west London, last month where 
he was living with another fugitive ETA terrorist who appeared alongside
 him in the dock today.

Wearing
 a grey and blue polo neck jumper shaven headed Troitino listened 
intently as the facts of his terrorist attack were outlined.

He
 is refusing to be sent home to serve the remaining 2,096 days of his 
sentence on a number of grounds including that it breaches his human 
right to liberty.

Troitino, from the Palencia province of northern Spain, was one of ETA's most prolific killers in the 1980s.

Melanie Cumberland, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates' Court the arrest warrant was issued in April 2011 and certified by SOCA on June 29 this year.

She said: 'This defendant is a convicted person, his extradition is sought for the purpose of serving the remainder of the sentence of imprisonment of 2,096 days, that's five years, nine months and five days.

'The basis of the conviction is for 91 offences was that on the days leading up to July 14 1986 this defendant and others, all members of the terrorist organisation ETA, planned, prepared and detonated an explosive device which was planted in a van in Madrid.'

Terror: Masked members of ETA raise their fists as they declare a permanent cease-fire in January. The separatist cell has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s

The van was packed with five pressure cookers, metal shrapnel, 35kg of plastic explosives and a remote control trigger device and parked at the side of a busy road.

Ms Cumberland said: 'This defendant activated a remote explosive device when a bus full of members of the Civil Guard was coming past.

'As a consequence 12 members of the Civil Guard died, 43 were injured and 17 civilians were injured.'

He was arrested in 1987 and jailed for 2,232 years at the National Court in 1989 for terrorist murder, attempted terrorist murder, and offences of terrorist havoc.

Destruction: In July 1986 Troitino detonated a car bomb by remote control in the Plaza de la Republica Dominicana in Madrid. The blast destroyed a Civil Guard van, killing 12 officers and wounding 51 people

But Spanish law meant that the maximum he could serve in jail was 30 years and his sentence was commuted.

At the time the term was reduced the law also meant he was entitled to be released on remission and they let him walk free after 24 years.

But they recalled him a week later after a 2006 Supreme Court ruling known as the 'Parrot doctrine' meant he could now served longer behind bars.

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Troitino, from the Palencia province of northern Spain, was one of ETA's most prolific killers in the 1980s

Troitino has refused to be extradited claiming he had not breach his licence and that the process was a breach of article 5 of the human rights act - his right to liberty.

His legal team argued that the Spanish court cannot cannot change the rules retroactively and force him to serve longer behind bars than was originally legal.

Mark Summers, defending, said that he left Spain legally on proper travel documents, adding: 'He has not fled Spain, he is not a fugitive from justice, he has spent over 24 years in custody and as a result he is a fragile man.'

District Judge Daphne Wickham refused the application on the grounds 'alarm bells' were set ringing by the fact that when he was arrested by armed cops he was living with illegal immigrants in a house with £8,000 in cash and false ID documents.

He is being held in high security prison Belmarsh and his extradition is due to be heard in September.

Another of Spain's most wanted men, Inaki Lerin Sanchez, 39, appeared alongside him in the dock today as the court did not have enough staff to separate them.

The pair had been living together but their cases are not linked. Both are refusing to be returned to their homeland.

Sanchez is wanted after Spanish police raided the home he shared with his brother. It was searched in March 2007 and a 'bomb making factory' was found, prosecutor Ben Watson said.

Inside they found 150kg of explosives, bolts and ball bearings, detonators and ETA propaganda. But when they tried to arrest Sanchez he had already fled.

His extradition hearing will be heard later this year.
