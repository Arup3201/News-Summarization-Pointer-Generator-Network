An Iraq war veteran who helped wipe out 50 enemy soldiers in one of the bloodiest battles of the conflict has sold his bravery medal for £156,000.

Colour Sergeant James Harkess, 46, cannot work for medical reasons after leaving the army and the sale of his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - just one down from the Victoria Cross - will help support him financially.

The medal sold at London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb for a hammer price of £130,000 but with all the fees added on the total sum came to £156,000.

The sale came on the same day it emerged Afghan veteran Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was to auction his CGC for £70,000. 

Sgt Harkess was awarded his CGC in 2006 after he and the crew of the Warrior armoured vehicle he was in command of fought off 200 Mahdi Army soldiers during an intense six hour battle.

The four-man crew were attacked from all sides with rocket propelled grenades, hand grenades, heavy gun and sniper fire and blast bombs which peppered the vehicle.

The men 'took down' wave after wave of enemy soldiers that came at them.

The battle in Al Amarah, near Basra, was one of three occasions in two just months where Sgt Harkess displayed 'exceptional bravery' by putting himself in the line of fire to save his men.

He first rescued his platoon after securing and holding a route to safety having been cut off by 50 heavily-armed militiamen.

Sgt Harkess also went on to bravely lead his Warrior platoon towards the enemy after an insurgent ambush on a night-time supply convoy.

With his men pinned down by three snipers he located them, killing two with his rifle and pistol.

Sgt Harkess, a former coal miner, spent 22 years in the army and left last year.

He later recalled: 'It was constant. There was no let-up, and I was firing all through. My crew took down 50 enemy in total easily. They were coming at us in waves – you could see bodies stacked up where we'd been killing them.

'Guys would jump on rooftops five metres away and start firing. You'd put them down, then more would be there a minute later.'

The platoon sergeant, who left the Army last year after 22 years, said: 'I loved the Army. I miss it but when it's your time to leave, you have to go. I have all the memories I require.'

The back of Colour Sergeant James Harkess' CGC has his name and rank engraved on it

Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal is second only to the Victoria Cross and was created in 1993 and can be awarded to all ranks of the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.

It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously.

The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross with a laurel wreath underneath, and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse.

Corporal Wayne Mills was the first recipient of the CGC, after he saved the lives of his patrol by single-handedly holding off a group of attackers which serving in Bosnia in 1994.

Other recipients include Dipprasad Pun, a Nepalese corporal with the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was awarded the honour after he defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post in Helmand province in 2010.

Three-time Boat Race winner and Army Captain Robin Bourne-Taylor was awarded the medal in 2010, while Royal Marine Mark Jackson ensured his receipt of the award was an extra-special day by proposing to his girlfriend Rebecca Daniel after the 2011 ceremony.

To date, 38 CGC's have been awarded for soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and 14 to those serving in Iraq.

Speaking of his medals, he added: 'I suffer from ill-health which has meant I have not been able to work. Because of this I am dependent on my Army pension so the sale will help me financially.'

Physical ill-health means he cannot work, leaving him to rely on his army pension which has prompted his decision to sell his medals at auction.

Bravery: Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was awarded the Conspicuous Gallery Cross for saving five wounded comrades during a Taliban attack

L/Cpl Toge is selling his bravery medal for £70,000 next month at Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset.

L/Cpl Toge showed 'superhuman strength that would have left Rambo in the shade' to rescue five wounded comrades during a battle with the Taliban in 2008. 

The armoured Warrior vehicle he was with was hit by ten rocket propelled grenades, leaving him unconscious and several troops badly hurt.

He came to after 10 seconds and then pulled one severely injured soldier out of the Warrior, lifted him to safety and administered first aid.

He found another four wounded soldiers on the ground nearby and single-handedly carried one after the other away from the killing area while being shot at and bombed.

L/Cpl Toge sprung back into action to lead the rest of his men to high ground overlooking a village controlled by the enemy who were being led by Taliban warlord Abdul Bari.

The men got to within 100 metres of the Taliban before they established contact with at least 20 of them, exchanging grenade and rifle fire before withdrawing to allow British air support to bomb the area.

L/Cpl Toge, from Shropshire, is selling his medals as he intends to use the money to start up his own business since leaving the army.
