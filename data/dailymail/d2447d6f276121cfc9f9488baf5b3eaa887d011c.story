Repeat offender John Moir, 46 has been jailed for ten months after being caught driving while banned

A serial criminal who has been banned from the road for the 43rd time told police that going back to jail would not stop him driving again.

John Moir, 46, has been jailed for ten months after boasting to officers who arrested him that he was playing a 'game of cat and mouse' with them.

He has been convicted of 218 separate offences, one of which involved him ploughing into a pedestrian who nearly died of his injuries.

In the latest case, South East 
Suffolk magistrates' court in Ipswich heard Moir was pulled up by police
last Wednesday for driving while banned.

The court heard that when he was questioned about the offence, an unrepentant Moir told officers: 'It's a game of cat and mouse.

'I never admit anything, this isn't going to stop me driving. Going to prison won't stop me.'

Emma Howson, prosecuting, said that Moir, who has 52 previous convictions, was caught driving a silver Vauxhall Tigra in Woodbridge, Suffolk, at 4pm last Wednesday.

Police found the motor belonged to his partner and arrested him.  In court Moir, of Ipswich, Suffolk,  also admitted two thefts from vehicles in car parks over Christmas.

Moir had piled up 42 previous convictions for driving while disqualified and had 77 thefts on his criminal record, the court heard.

His last conviction was on August 13, 2012, for driving while banned, resisting a police officer and having no car insurance, for which he was jailed for five months.

'I believe he will kill someone eventually': Simon Jacobs, 45, nearly died after Moir drove into him in 2010

Moir admitted driving while banned, having no insurance, and two charges of theft.

He received a four-month jail sentence for driving while disqualified, and three months for each theft to run consecutively.

Moir was also given a 12-month driving ban to replace a two-year disqualification he was given on September 6, 2011.

If he wants to apply for a new licence after his ban expires he will have to take an extended driving re-test before he is legally allowed to drive a vehicle.

Father-of-two Simon Jacobs, 45, was left
in a coma and doctors believed he would die after Moir hit him after 
jumping a red light in Ipswich in August 2010.

Moir served just nine months in prison after he was eventually captured following the incident in which he nearly killed Mr Jacobs.

Today Mr Jacobs, who had been walking home from a snooker hall when he was hit, warned: 'I believe
it is only a matter of time before he kills someone.

Hearing: South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court in Ipswich was told how Moir taunted officers who questioned him

'I was lucky, but next time things could be very different.'

The former electrician will never work again after sustaining terrible head injuries, and can no longer drive.

He added: 'He has left me with a life sentence - I will never get over my injuries.

'When he ran into me he got 18 months, but only served half.  The next time it was 14 months and now 10.

'It is an insult.  I believe it is only a matter of time before he kills someone.

'I was lucky but next time things could be very different.  I just find it ludicrous, it is laughable.  The justice system needs to listen up, they are playing a waiting game - eventually I believe he will kill someone.'

There are several contenders for the title of Britain's worst driver.

In 2008 Jamie Manderson of Swindon was jailed for eight months and banned from driving for five years after being caught driving while banned - for the 51st time.

He was first banned from driving at the age 15, and never held a driving licence.

Manderson, then 35, was told in court: 'This is the worst case of driving while disqualified - in total - we have come across.'

Also in 2008 Anthony Marland, then 39, of Ashton under Lyne, was convicted of driving while disqualified for the 54th time, and was told by a judge: 'This is one of the worst records of driving I have ever seen.'

In 2010 Wayne Atkinson, then 38, from Bristol, was banned from driving for two years after being caught driving at 70mph in a 30mph zone, on the wrong side of the street and through red lights.

Atkinson, who had never held a licence since his first disqualification in 1993, walked free from court despite the judge describing his record as 'appalling'.
