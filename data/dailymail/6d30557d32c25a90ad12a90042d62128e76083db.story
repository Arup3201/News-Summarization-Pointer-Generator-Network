A grandmother of five made more than 5,000 jars of marmalade to raise £10,000 to help poor people all over the Third World.

For the last 16 year, Gloria Irons has been giving away jars of her home-made fruit spread in return for donations to the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD).

The 70-year-old said her marmalade has even been taken to far-flung African countries such as Rwanda and Ethiopia for the locals to enjoy.

Gloria Irons from Norwich has been giving away her jars of homemade marmalade in return for donations to the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD)

'I just love doing it and I'll continue as long as I can,' said Mrs Irons, of Norwich.

Even breaking her wrist did not stop the retired carer, as she roped in her supportive husband Colin and supervised the marmalade making.

'I can make 24 jars in two hours now, including washing and sterilising the jars.

'It got a bit tricky when I broke my wrist but Colin helped me out.

'It all started by accident. I was going to a fete and I had forgotten to bake anything.

'I grabbed some jars of marmalade I had made and they sold like hot cakes.'

Her closely-guarded recipe for the orange variety proved an instant hit and began selling as quickly as she could make it.

A CAFOD worker took one jar to Rwanda, where Mrs Iron's group of churches, St George's, Our Lady Mother of God, and St Boniface Church, were supporting a community in Musha.

'I only gave it to her as a joke to take - I didn't expect her to. It was lovely to see the people with my marmalade in photos.'

Made with love: Mrs Irons says she wants to help those less fortunate than her 

Although the recipe changes slightly for Christmas punters, with some additional whisky in tinsel-decorated jars, there is another crucial ingredient.

'I just put love into it.

'Through CAFOD, I have learnt a lot about the poverty in other countries.

'I want to help those less fortunate.

'They have so little and we have so much.

'We've raised money for different appeals over the years.

'One that sticks in my mind was the horrendous floods in Mozambique. We heard about a community who lived close to the river banks.

'Their homes were completely washed away.

'After the floods, CAFOD helped the community to build new homes, higher up the hills away from the river.

'I can remember this old boy sitting in his new tin hut; the icing on the cake for him was that he now had a tin roof.

'He said he felt like a king - and all he needed now was a wife.

'It's amazing to see that kind of sense of humour after all that had happened. It makes you feel quite humble.'
