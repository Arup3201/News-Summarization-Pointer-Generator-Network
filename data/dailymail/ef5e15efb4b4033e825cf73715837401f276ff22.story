Online retailer N Brown is set to buck the trend of retailers leaving the High Street by expanding its network of physical stores.

The firm, which owns brands such as Figleaves.com, Simply Be and Jacamo, yesterday revealed that its revenues rose by 8.5 per cent last year despite the sluggish economy.

The plan to move into the High Street comes despite a wave of high-profile bankruptcies in the past week, with Jessops, HMV and Blockbuster shutting down or entering administration.

Expansion: N Brown, owner of Simply Be, is set to open more High Street stores selling its brands

N Brown, which specialises in clothes for older women and people who are too large to wear traditional fashion lines, has in the past been primarily a mail-order retailer.

However, online sales now account for 54 per cent of its revenue after rising by 17 per cent over the past 19 weeks, according to The Times.

As the company seeks to cut costs on its catalogue division, one likely strategy is to open more High Street branches selling its brands.

'We are an online company looking to open stores,' chief executive Alan White said.

Brands: The retailer specialises in aiming its products at middle-aged women and larger customers

For men: Jacamo, promoted by cricketer Andrew Flintoff, is another successful N Brown brand

The retailer currently operates a total of 48 stores, including seven which opened in the past year selling products from Simply Be, the 'plus size' women's brand.

Mr White said N Brown would open up to six more Simply Be stores in 2013, and would aim to end up with a network of 25 stores with 'nationwide coverage'.

Some of the branches will also sell the Jacamo range for larger men, which is promoted by former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff.

Shares in the firm have risen by 60 per cent over the course of the past year as it saw strong growth in the U.S. as well as in its British stores and online.

Struggling: HMV is one of many well-known firms to have gone into administration in recent months

The success of N Brown, which has been operating from Manchester since 1859, stands in stark contrast to the fate of other major brands.

This week it was announced that both music retailer HMV and video rental chain Blockbuster have gone into administration after seeing their profits relentlessly squeezed by the rise of digital media and online retailers.

The iconic firms could disappear from the High Street within months if administrators do not succeed in finding a buyer for them.

Other companies hit by the double-dip recession have been forced to close down altogether in the wake of squeezed consumer spending.

JJB Sports, Comet and Jessops all shut up shop recently as the High Street vacancy rate reached an astonishing one in nine.

Among the others to go into administration are Peacocks, La Senza, Blacks, Game, and Clinton Cards, while 
more are expected as the economy shows little sign of picking up any time soon.

N Brown may be expanding its physical presence, but the past few years have seen brutal conditions on the High Street as a host of well-known retailers have gone out of business

December 2008: MFI,
the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of 
business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall 
following a sharp rise in unemployment

January 2009: Woolworths, right, shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the
UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first 
time

February 2009: Zavvi, formerly Virgin Megastores, stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to 
honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger

December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs 
and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers

October 2012: JJB Sports
closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded 
by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 
employees losing their jobs

December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out 
of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a Â£50million tab related to 
its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a 
reduction in the number of home buyers

January 2013: Jessops was
closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of 
struggling with online competition as customers turned away from 
traditional photography; this week both HMV and Blockbusters went into administration, raising the prospect of further store closures
