Arsene Wenger promised a new-look Mesut Ozil upon his return from injury. A stronger, bulked-up, better than he was before, Ozil.

A knee problem has kept him out since October - a terrible shame given he was just getting started in a vital campaign that could have restarted his career.

In truth, Ozil has not been as good for Arsenal as most expected he would be. £42.5million is a lot of money, and for that you would expect more world-class performances than he has given to date.

But here is another opportunity to shine. His first start for the Gunners since October 5, a chance to show his best qualities against opposition from the league below. 

Brighton, all told, are not a bad side. Not as good as they were two seasons ago though, and Arsenal should have been able to flex their muscles with relative ease.

It couldn't have started much better for Arsene Wenger's side in this FA Cup fifth round match. Two minutes in, Calum Chambers to Theo Walcott. 1-0. 

Sunday was only the sixth time that Walcott and Ozil have started together for Arsenal. It's surely a combination that Wenger will have longed for, but various injuries have meant that while one is fit, the other is laying on a treatment table in London Colney.

As Arsenal began to really impose themselves on the game, so too did Ozil. Aside from a cameo appearance against Stoke earlier this month, these were his first real minutes of 2015. 

Ozil was given a free rein to drift around the midfield. Technically wide on the team-sheet, but in reality able to come and go as he pleased. And that works for him.

If you pigeon-hole him, he runs the risk of being ineffective. Wenger has been honest in his assessment of Ozil's positioning, admitting that the German doesn't enjoy being sent to hug the touchline.

And so, his overriding moment in this game came from him drifting in and sitting on Brighton's back four. Tomas Rosicky played the ball through; an eye-of-the-needle, perfectly-weighted knock. A touch with his left foot, a touch with his right foot, and then a shot into the bottom corner of the net from Arsenal's No 11.

David Stockdale could not have been expected to save it; it was too far into the corner of his net, and Ozil had taken the first steps on the road to regaining his form.

Ozil, and Arsenal, played well and despite only just winning, deserve their place in the fifth round draw

As the half-time whistle blew, most players trudged towards the tunnel, grateful for a rest. Not Ozil. He continued at the same pace he'd played the first 45, running towards the changing rooms. Get the team-talk done, and let us get back out there. He was hungry for more. 

Arsenal netted a third in the second-half, after a brief scare from Brighton when Chris O'Grady brilliantly fired into Wojciech Szczesny's net, and after that things calmed down.

In the eyes of many, the tie was won and it was now about maintaining a steady pace for Arsenal. Ozil's game slowed too. It is to be expected in his first game back, of course. This is just the beginning, providing that he stays injury-free.

Brighton pulled another back; 3-2. Ozil's final few minutes were nervy and frantic, perhaps exactly what he didn't need. Wenger, at 2-0 and 3-1, will have hoped for a simple finish but it was not forthcoming... not if the Seagulls had anything to do with it.

In the end, Arsenal's back-line stayed strong, Ozil came off after 80 minutes, and they held on for a 3-2 win. Just. The German playmaker performed well and deserved his first-half goal. 

Perhaps there won't be a post-match changing room selfie, but Arsenal's performance did deserve a place in Monday's fifth round draw. 

For Ozil, this is just the beginning. After an FA Cup tie against lower-league opposition, he cannot claim to be fully reintegrated into the team. Brighton will not pose the same test as, say, Tottenham a week on Saturday, or Monaco in the Champions League later in February.

But it's a start, and a good one at that. Now he must kick on and fully prove himself in the Premier League.
