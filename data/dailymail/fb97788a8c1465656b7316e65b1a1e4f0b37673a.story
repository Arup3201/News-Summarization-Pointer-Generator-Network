Manu Tuilagi's chances of being involved in the early stages of the Six Nations appear to be receding as Leicester have suggested he may not return from injury until January 31.

The Tigers had said that they expected the Anglo-Samoan centre to recover from a groin problem by Christmas, but that projected comeback date was put back a fortnight.

Now the indications are that he may not re-surface until just six days before England face Wales in the championship opener in Cardiff.

Asked for an update on Wedesday, Richard Cockerill, Leicester's director of rugby, said: 'Manu may be mid-January; it might be a week before or a week after. He’ll be fit for the LV Cup game when we play Saints (on January 31) - that’s the start of the Six Nations.'

However, he added: 'Manu’s working hard and he’s doing well. He should be fit for the Six Nations.'
