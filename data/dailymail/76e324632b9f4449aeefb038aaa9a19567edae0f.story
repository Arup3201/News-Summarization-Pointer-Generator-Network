His turbulent love life and antics in Memphis might have dominated headlines in recent weeks but Prince Harry put high jinks to one side as he laid a wreath honouring Estonian soldiers in Tallinn's Freedom Square.

The 29-year-old travelled to Talinn on a £143 easyJet flight - not the first time he has used the budget carrier, but still a highly unusual mode of transport for an official royal visit.

Prince Harry's trip coincides with the return home of the last members of the Estonian contingent from Afghanistan, where they fought under British command and nine were killed.

All smiles: Price Harry wins hearts and minds in Estonia, posing for a selfie with a delighted local lady

Mr Popular: Prince Harry proved a hit with the local ladies, many of whom travelled to Tallinn to meet him

International relations: These admiring glances say Prince Harry could teach the Foreign Office a thing or two

Prince Harry, himself a serving soldier, spent time with the Estonian troops during his two tours of Afghanistan, the most recent of which was in 2012.

And it seems his appreciation of all things Estonian is fully reciprocated, after a cheering crowd of more than 300 people turned up to greet him as he arrived at Freedom Square.

Mingling with well-wishers, the prince stopped and posed for a number of selfies and earned himself a big smile from one local lady, whose crown-shaped placard he signed.

He couldn't resist a cheerful chat with the local ladies and swiftly set about winning hearts and minds as he arrived in Estonia to start a two-day tour.

One little girl seemed a bit overcome and snuggled bashfully into her father's chest after presenting a delighted Prince Harry with her Union flag.

After meeting the crowds, Prince Harry, who flew in on an EasyJet plane, paused to contemplate the cross-topped memorial dedicated to freedom fighters that dominates Tallinn's central square.

Nice to meet you! The prince beamed as he greeted the crowd, many of whom were waving Union flags

Bashful: Slightly overcome, the little girl then turned her face away shyly much to the amusement of the prince

Chat: After his walk about in Tallinn, the prince went on to lay a wreath in honour of Estonia's fallen soldiers

Excited: One little girl with an England plastic hand looked absolutely thrilled as Prince Harry shook her 'hand'

Enjoying the day: The prince took his time on the walkabout among cheering locals in Estonian capital Tallinn

The prince, a serving Army officer, wore the all white tropical no 1 dress of the Household Cavalry and watched as two Estonian servicemen carefully placed his wreath at the base of the monument.

Built from large glass blocks, it commemorates the 1918-1920 war of independence that saw the fledging country defeat Russian and German forces in its struggle for self-determination.

The UK supported Estonia's fight for freedom and was one of the first to answer its call for help, providing naval support, armaments and other equipment - a move that defended the coastline and allowed the new country to build its own navy.

The blooms on Harry's wreath featured some of Estonia's national colours, blue and white, and pinned to a ribbon attached to the floral tribute was a handwritten note that said: 'In memory of all those who gave their lives for their country - Harry'.

Sombre: After greeting the crowds, Prince Harry paid his respects in a wreath-laying ceremony in Tallinn

Solemn: He was joined for the ceremony by senior members of the Estonian army which fought in Afghanistan

Salute: The prince saluted as he and the crowd observed a minute's silence in honour of Estonia's fallen

The prince bent down to adjust the wreath then took a few steps back and paused in a mark of respect as a bugler played the last post before saluting the monument during a minute's silence.

After paying his respects, the prince was driven off to a military hospital where he met wounded Afghanistan victims - some of whom will compete in the Invictus Games in September - before addressing the Parliament of Estonia.

Tomorrow, the prince is due to meet Estonia's president, Toomas Hendrik, and military leaders in Kevadtorm before observing NATO's Spring Storm military exercise.

On Sunday, the 29-year-old will travel to Italy for the first time since visiting on a family holiday in 1985, where he will attend a number of events commemorating the Allied campaign during World War Two.

His trip to Italy will include a visit to Monte Cassino, where he will attend the New Zealand service at the Cassino Commonwealth War Cemetery, and a trip to Rome. 

Prince Harry has travelled with easyJet in the past, but always for private holidays - such as his summer visit to Scotland in 2011.

In August 2012 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also used easyJet for a private visit to the Alps - even waiting in line with all the other passengers during security checks.

It remains highly unusual, however, for a senior member of the Royal Family to use a budget carrier for an official visit.
