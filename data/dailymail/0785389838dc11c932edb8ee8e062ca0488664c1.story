Ministers have promised millions in taxpayers’ money to help people end their marriages more easily.

The cash will subsidise mediation services, designed to allow couples to negotiate how to divide their property and look after their children.

To mark ‘divorce day’, family justice minister Lord McNally pledged an extra £10million for the services, saying they offer ‘a quicker and simpler approach which brings better outcomes’ for families.

Divorce day: The pressure of the holiday season results in an annual peak of couples contacting divorce lawyers and thanks to the new £10million, the process should be quicker than ever

Divorce day is the name given by lawyers to the first working day in January, when approaches to legal firms by disenchanted couples are usually at their highest.

The Ministry of Justice said on average the extra cash means that a divorce will last a quarter of the time and save £3,500 for husbands and wives claiming legal aid to pay for lawyers.

Whitehall calculations say a mediated
 divorce funded by the state costs £500 as opposed to £4,000 for one 
argued in the courts, and that a mediated split takes 110 days rather 
than the 435 days for contested divorces.

Lord
 McNally said mediation avoided ‘traumatic’ courtroom struggles, adding:
 ‘All too often money is wasted on hearings that can take far too long 
to resolve.’

Speeding things up: A mediated divorce tends to finish within four months, a quarter of the time of a non-mediated split

The extra money means mediation will be subsidised to the tune of £25million this year.

Divorce rates are at their lowest 
level since the 1970s, but ministers have long been pressing the case 
for mediation on the grounds that it saves large sums of public money in
 the courts and in benefit payments.

Politicians also say that avoiding conflict helps families overcome the impact of divorce on families.

However, mediation has proved unpopular with most divorcing couples.

The last Tory government tried to encourage divorce through mediation with its Family Law Act, which would have brought in fault-free divorce in all cases, and which required all parting married couples to attend at least an introductory meeting about mediation.

Few couples showed interest and trials showed the new law to be unworkable. Labour later repealed the legislation.

Critics of mediation say it favours the stronger and most outspoken spouse and that it makes divorce too easy.

Lawyers say that last year approaches from husbands and wives about divorce went up by a quarter in early January.

John Nicholson of the Irwin Mitchell law firm said: ‘Reasons for divorce vary widely but there seems to be a consensus that there is a feeling of New Year, new start for many people and that is why they talk to lawyers in January.

‘Whether people have had a turbulent Christmas period, have been planning a break-up for months or perhaps older couples growing apart due to empty-nest syndrome, January often brings the promise of a fresh life away from whatever problems they may have faced before.’
