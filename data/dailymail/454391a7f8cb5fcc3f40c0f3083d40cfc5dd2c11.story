A pair of daredevil paragliders have given an insight into their thrill-seeking world with a white knuckle video shot on a GoPro camera. 

Spectacular footage shows them dropping from sheer mountain tops, swooping over waterfalls and skimming the ground with their toes.

The stunt parachutists shot the footage across France between July and October, 2014.

Many of the shots of them speed flying over stunning scenery were filmed in the Haute-Savoie department in the Rhône-Alpes region of eastern France, bordering Switzerland and Italy.

The base jumping shots were filmed in the Savoie Mont Granier and Isère Gorges de la bourne.

The adventurers can be seen skimming close tot he ground, even brushing along the grass at some points

The daredevils are seen flying past waterfalls and somersaulting over hills and mountain tops

Skimming the grass with their toes they weave between trees, casting shadows over the canape and finally landing like graceful swans into a river.
