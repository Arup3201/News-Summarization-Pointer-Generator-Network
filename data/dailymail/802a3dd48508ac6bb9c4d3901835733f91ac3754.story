HIV under an EM microscope: A cure for AIDS has got a step closer after scientists found that a common cancer drug can purge the disease as it lies dormant in the body

A cure for AIDS has got a step closer after scientists found that a common cancer drug can purge the disease as it lies dormant in the body.

Current treatments are effective at reducing levels of the disease in the bloodstream - but a drug that can 'knock out' the disease when it lies dormant is thought to be key to a cure.

Tests on eight HIV-positive men found that the drug was highly effective in 'unmasking' the hidden reservoirs in the body - which the researchers say is a vital step towards eradicating HIV from the body.

‘This work provides compelling evidence 
for a new strategy to directly attack and eradicate latent HIV 
infection,’ said David Margolis at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.

‘Long-term, widespread use of 
antiretrovirals has personal and public health consequences, including 
side effects, financial costs, and community resistance,’ said Margolis,
who led the study.

‘We must seek other ways to end the epidemic, and 
this research provides new hope for a strategy to eradicate HIV 
completely from the body.’

The existence of persistent 
reservoirs of dormant HIV in the immune system that are not attacked by 
anti-AIDS drugs is believed to be a major reason why infection reemerges
once patients stop taking their medication.

The disruption and clearance of these reservoirs is critical to finding a cure for AIDS.

Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have published pioneering research showing that a drug used to treat certain types of lymphoma was able to dislodge hidden virus in patients receiving treatment for HIV.

Researchers at UNC, working in collaboration with scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health, National Cancer Institute, Merck, and the University of California at San Diego, undertook a series of experiments designed to evaluate the potential of the drug vorinostat, a deacetylase inhibitor that is used to treat some types of lymphoma, to activate and disrupt the dormant virus.

Initially, laboratory experiments measuring active HIV levels in CD4+ T cells, which are specialized white blood cells that the virus uses to replicate, showed that vorinostat unmasked the hidden virus in these cells.

Subsequently, vorinostat was administered to eight HIV-infected men who were medically stable on antiretroviral therapy and the levels of active HIV virus were measured and compared to the levels prior to administration.

Those patients receiving vorinostat showed an average 4.5-fold increase in the levels of HIV RNA in CD4+ T cells, evidence that the virus was being unmasked.

This is the first published study to show the potential for deacetylase inhibitors to attack latency within dormant virus pools in a translational clinical study.

Targeting latency is the first step on a path that may lead to a cure.
