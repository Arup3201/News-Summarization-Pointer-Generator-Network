A record breaking Range Rover – arguably the fastest sports utility vehicle in the world - has accelerated out of Jaguar Land Rover's 'Special Vehicle Operations' stable. 

The Range Rover Sport SVR is powered by a specially tuned 542bhp 5.0 litre V8 that propels it from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds and up to a top speed electronically limited to 162mph. 

That makes it the fastest Range Rover ever. But it has also set a surprise record at Germany's Nuerburgring by lapping the infamous Nordschleife circuit in eight minutes and 14 seconds.

That's firmly in supercar territory with the streamlined Audi R8V8 managing only 10 seconds faster. 

The new British 4X4 which thinks it's a supercar had its world debut among the super-rich at the prestigious Pebble Beach concourse event in California.

A Land Rover spokesman said: 'The fastest, most powerful Land Rover ever produced is the first model to wear the SVR designation being adopted by future Land Rover and Jaguar high-performance models.' 

The powerful engine is linked to a slick 8-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel-drive chassis to boost performance whatever the weather.

It even sounds like a supercar. 

In a world first for Land Rover, the new Range Rover Sport SVR has a two-stage active exhaust featuring electronically controlled valves. 

A spokesman said: 'The system optimises sound quality, performance and aesthetics and provides a racecar-inspired soundtrack at higher engine revs.' 

Spectacular: The Sports SVR goes from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds and up to a top speed electronically limited to 162mph

Top of the range: Order books for the 4X4 open in October priced at £93,450 or nearly £12,000 more than the standard Range Rover Sport

Exhilarating: The powerful engine is linked to a slick 8-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel-drive chassis to boost performance whatever the weather

The off-the scale off-roader sits on huge 22 inch alloy wheels specially made for high performance.

Inside is a sumptuous bespoke interior featuring unique sports seats to keep the driver and passengers snugly in place. 

John Edwards, managing director of Land Rover's Special Operations division said: 'The Range Rover Sport SVR is truly the world's most capable performance sports utility vehicle.'

'It is designed, engineered and built in Britain and amplifies the engineering integrity, robustness and attention to detail that are Land Rover hallmarks'.

He said: 'It is a natural progression beyond the core vehicle's outstanding on- and off-road capabilities and leading-edge design. 

'Its exhilarating performance will satisfy a particularly demanding set of customers. 

'It takes the vehicle's dynamic capabilities to the next level without impacting on comfort, refinement or all-terrain versatility.'
