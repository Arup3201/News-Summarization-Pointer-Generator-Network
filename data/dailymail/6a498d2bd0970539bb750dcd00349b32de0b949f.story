With its caffeinated, sugary taste, it is the best-selling energy drink in the world.

But one of its key consumer groups - young adults - is becoming increasingly health-conscious.

Now, Red Bull has unveiled two new zero-calorie editions in a bid to appeal to millennials.

The drinks, available in Orange and Wild Cherry flavors, were launched at the weekend to coincide with Daylight Savings Time, when Americans may need an energy boost after losing an hour of time.

They are being advertised in a wide-reaching campaign alongside three other Red Bull Editions drinks, including a new yellow-colored Tropical flavor that was briefly tested last summer.

The other two flavors, Cranberry (red) and Blueberry (blue), were launched two years ago.

In a bid to promote its new flavors and zero-calorie editions, Red Bull and its longtime agency, Kastner and Partners, are displaying the colorful cans on more than 3,000 billboards nationwide.

These include boards in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. The drinks are being pictured alongside swirling rays of light, Red Bull's logo and slogans such as 'Wings For Every Taste'.

Red Bull is also advertising its new drinks online. It has paid for takeover adds on Pandora and continues to release videos of millennials consuming the drinks on Twitter, Adweek.com reported.

'The energy category is still very dynamic, but we've talked with Red Bull about expanding their customer base,' Richard Turner, Kastner and Partners' managing director, told the website.

Promotion: On Sunday, Red Bull tweeted a photo of several girls holding out the new drinks, with a caption relating to Daylight Savings Time (pictured - 'Spring Forward with a little more flavor. #GivesYouWings')

Enthusiastic response: The image gained a largely positive reaction, with 162 users 'favoriting' the post. One user. Katie Riehl, tweeted: 'OMG THERE IS NOW CHERRY @redbull AND I NEED TO TRY IT RIGHT NOW' (pictured)

Fan: Meanwhile, user Siena Liggins tweeted: 'Red Bull Yellow, Cherry and Orange Editions will be the reason I get through this week alive' Another user, a man named Dayton Maxson, wrote: 'i love Redbull so much :)'

He said the firms had together decided to do so 'by offering low-calorie, low-sugar alternatives'.

He added that he hopes the bright adverts would appeal to millennials. 'It feels like it's familiar to an audience that loves the festival scene and the idea of music and light going together,' he said.

And the digital arm of Red Bull's advertising campaign appears to have been successful so far.

On Sunday, the brand tweeted a photo of several girls holding out the new drinks, with a caption relating to Daylight Savings Time ('Spring Forward with a little more flavor. #GivesYouWings'). 

Wide-reaching campaign: In a bid to promote its new flavors and zero-calorie editions, Red Bull and its longtime agency, Kastner and Partners, are displaying the colorful cans on more than 3,000 billboards nationwide.

'Not a daily drink': A female Twitter user called Val - who tweeted a photo of a can of Wild Cherry Red Bull she had bought - noted that although the zero-calorie edition was 'delicious', 'I don't think I could have it every day'

Another user, a man named Dayton Maxson, wrote: 'i love Redbull so much :).'

Meanwhile, in response to a promotional video, user Siena Liggins, from Michigan,‏ tweeted: 'Red Bull Yellow, Cherry, and Orange Editions will be the reason I get through this week alive.'

But a woman called Val - who tweeted a photo of a can of Wild Cherry Red Bull she had bought - noted that although the zero-calorie edition was 'delicious', 'I don't think I could have it every day'.

Normal version: Red Bull's US advertising campaign will run through the summer. The firm will launch a similar campaign in Canada in April. Above, Austrian pilot Hannes Arch drinks Red Bull's now-famous energy drink

Last year, Goldman Sachs released a report saying that the millennial generation is far more health conscious than its predecessors. It remarked: 'Healthy living sets the new standard of cool.' 

On its website, Red Bull says of its drinks: 'The Red Bull Editions combine the functionality of Red Bull Energy Drink with the taste of Orange, Wild Cherry, Cranberry, Blueberry and Tropical fruits.'

It will launch a similar campaign in Canada in April.
