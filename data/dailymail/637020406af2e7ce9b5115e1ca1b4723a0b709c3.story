He has been playing polo for many years and is a gifted sportsman.

But as this picture shows, despite his vast amount of experience, even Prince William can come a cropper during his beloved sport.

The royal heir was taking part in a game of polo at Chester Racecourse this afternoon when he almost had a very nasty accident.

Lucky: Prince William narrowly escaped a nasty fall this afternoon whilst playing polo in the Audi Challenge at Chester Racecourse

Tired: Despite managing to avoid falling, the sporty Prince rubs his head following the match and also wipes the sweat away following the fast-paced game

Poise: After using his mallet to maintain his balance, the Prince managed to just about hold on and continue playing

As he battled with his teammates, the 30-year-old was pictured almost slipping off his pony while travelling at speed.

After using his mallet to maintain his balance, he managed to just about stay in the seat of his pony.Â 

Fortunately, as reported by the Daily Express, the Prince managed to regain his composure and went onto score a point for his team during the Audi Challenge event. He could even be seen cheering following his success.

It also emerged today that the Duke of Cambridge showed off his other sporting skills recently when he visited homeless youngsters being helped by his charity Centrepoint.

The Duke of Cambridge played table tennis during the visit to a central London hostel.

Fun: The royal heir shows off his competitive side during the fast-paced match this afternoon

Action: With a competitor bearing down on him, the Prince concentrates to hit the ball

William is patron of the organisation that supports young rough sleepers trying to find a permanent home, and he paid a private visit to one of its London centres last Wednesday.

The second-in-line to the throne stayed for a just over two hours touring the facilities that can accommodate around 40 people for up to two years.

The Duke, casually dressed in a v-neck jumper, shirt, trousers and trainers, was guided around by the charity's chief executive Seyi Obakin.

Athletic: The Prince is known to enjoy a variety of sports and has played polo for much of his life

Enjoyment: William looked happy as he battled during the Audi Challenge

No way through: As a keen competitor, the Duke of Cambridge competes with an member of the opposing team

He sat down to an afternoon snack of 
homemade smoothies and flapjacks and then beat Mr Obakin in a game of 
table tennis before taking on some of the young residents.

Members of the Centrepoint parliament, young people who campaign on issues relevant to the homeless, also met the royal.

Centrepoint was one of William's mother's favourite charities and he took on the patronage - his first - in 2005.

Since then, he has spent a night sleeping rough on the streets of London after being challenged to do so by the charity.

Keen: The Prince smiles broadly after hitting the ball

Worn out: Prince William began to look slightly weary towards the end of the game

A spokesman for Centrepoint said: 'It was just an opportunity for him to meet more young people in a relaxed setting.

'When
there's a (press) rota going around with him the attention that brings 
to our charity is fantastic but for some of the young people we support,
the spotlight that comes with it is not good for them or their personal
circumstances.

'He can spend more time with them and visa versa.'

Sporty: The Duke of Cambridge showed off his other sporting skills recently when he visited homeless youngsters being helped by his charity Centrepoint

Competitive: The Prince clearly enjoyed himself during the table tennis match

Keen: The Duke of Cambridge visited one of the central London hostels to meet some of the young people and chat about housing

Happy: Prince William and Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin
