Sentenced: Marckenson Chery, 29, of North Lauderdale, Florida, has been jailed for 12 years for having cyber-sex sessions with a 15-year-old girl via Skype 

A 29-year-old retail worker has been sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for having cyber-sex sessions with a 15-year-old girl on Skype.

Marckenson Chery of North Lauderdale, Florida, first met the victim from San Francisco on the anonymous online chat site Omegle before they started video conferencing. 

The girl's horrified father became suspicious, confiscated her smartphone and discovered the '143 pages' worth of sexually-explicit conversations the pair had.

He then handed the information from exchanges Chery and his daughter had over two months to federal agents who subsequently arrested him.

Using the screen name 'Swag likeus Robinson', he told the girl he was 21. 

However, according to the Sun-Sentinel she constantly reminded him that she was only 15. 

Authorities said that Chery would convince the victim to get undressed and masturbate, while she would watch him perform sex acts on himself.

Following an investigation involving Homeland Security, Chery was arrested in April. 

He pleaded guilty to one count of enticement of a minor in September. 

When he is free, Chery will also have 10 years of supervised release and will have to register as a sex offender. 

Chery's attorney, Joshua Fisher, did not comment on the outcome of the case but had wrote in court documents that the defendant had been suffering from depression since his personal finances collapsed in 2009.

During the trial Joe Trias, the deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in South Florida. said that criminals use many different apps to make sexual contact with children and teens. 

Speaking to the Sentinel in May he said: 'We are seeing an increase in these kinds of cases, though I'd be hesitant to call it a trend,' Trias said in a phone interview with the Sun Sentinel on Monday.

'There's such a huge variety of apps … the criminal element is always going to find ways to use them for their own purposes.'

He warned parents to be vigilant with the social their children are using.

'The way one of our agents puts it is: "Do you want a 30-year-old man in your child's bedroom at 1 a.m.?"
