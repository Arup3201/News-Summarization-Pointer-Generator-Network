It was once a scenic holiday destination with luscious fields growing papaya fruit and anthurium plants.

But one slow-moving wave of charcoal black lava has crept across the Hawaiian town of Pahoa, obliterating acres of wildlife.

What's left is almost unrecognizable.

Before and after: Pahoa's vast swathes of green, luscious fields are now a sea of molten rock that could change Hawaii's landscape 

A series of before and after shots document the dramatic scale of Kilauea Mountain's devastating eruption on June 27. 

It has taken more than four months for the searing molten rock to crawl down to civilization.

Despite issuing warnings and deploying emergency services to prepare for it, there is little preventative action a government can take in the face of lava. 

Pahoa, the 'downtown' area of the agricultural Puna region, has the highest concentration of old buildings in Hawaii. 

The area has been transformed from sugar cane fields and timber yards into luscious nurseries of exotic fruits and plants.

Crushed: Last week a breakout from the slow-moving flow reached and obliterating this home, once owned by two Oregon brothers

Hawaii's burning: Smoke is pouring over the entire region of Puna and residents with breathing difficulties are warned to stay inside

Setting: The burning wave is beginning to set, leaving a rocky hillside on the fields that spills into a building, dwarfing cars and people

A key landmark in the district in the Lava Tree State Park, which is an ominous depiction of the devastating effects molten rock has had in the past.

The park was originally a vibrant rainforest.

But now, it is a collection of grey, hollow structures covered in moss.

On November 11, a breakout from the main flow claimed its first Hawaiian home, which had already been cleared out and abandoned by its Oregon-based owners.

Creeping: Authorities warned people with homes along this stretch to prepare for evacuation as the breakout creeps along

Powerless: Despite issuing warnings and deploying emergency services, there is little action a government can take in the face of lava

People watched as the bungalow burned and lava swept across the vast green fields nearby.

Authorities have closed the main road through the town and fear the molten rock could cut off Highway 130, the key access point to get in and out of the district.

The main flow has not advanced since October 30, but officials warn breakouts are still active.

On Sunday morning, citizens were assured the lava looks set to miss homes and residential areas.
