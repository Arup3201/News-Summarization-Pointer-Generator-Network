With just 40 days until Floyd Mayweather finally comes face-to-face with Manny Pacquiao inside a ring, the official poster for their mega-fight has been released.

The two boxers - Mayweather on the left and Pacquiao on the right - are both drenched in sweat as they pose in their fight trunks, staring menacingly down the camera with their hands wrapped.

Their names are displayed in striking orange font, as is the date of the fight (May 2) and the start times of the Las Vegas show.

Also included are logos for the fight's venue, the MGM Grand, and Showtime and HBO - the US broadcasters which will jointly broadcast the show live on pay-per-view.

Sky Sports are expected to show Mayweather's long-awaited clash with Pacquiao in the UK, although it could cost viewers over £20 to see it.

The poster was released as Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arums said the revenue from ticket sales could hit $74m, almost four times the current record.

Briefs were initially expected to cost between $1,000 and $5,000 but that upper limit has been raised to $10,000. A small number are set to go on sale to the public shortly.

'It's crazy, but it is what it is,' Arum told ESPN. 'It's amazing.' 

'We'll probably have a handful of tickets that will go on sale to the public next week. It's mania.'

There was also a fierce bidding war between two beer companies, Tecate and Corona to be one of the main sponsors. Tecate won with a bid of $5.6m compared to $5.2m from its rival. 

Meanwhile one of Mayweather's former opponents, Saul Alvarez, believes the American will dictate whether the fight is an exciting one for those watching around the world.

He told Fox Deportes: 'Floyd is very smart. He can makes things frustrating or he can make a spectacular fight. He does not expose anything.

'In the past, he's thrown very few shots and makes things difficult. If he exposes himself just a little bit more, we can get an enjoyable fight.

'Pacquiao comes forward and he's always throwing a lot of punches, and he's fast. He can complicate things with his movement as he did with (Timothy) Bradley and (Juan Manuel) Marquez. Hopefully the fight is attractive.'
