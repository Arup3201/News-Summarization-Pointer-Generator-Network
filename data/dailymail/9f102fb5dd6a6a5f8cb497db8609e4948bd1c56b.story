Two teenagers have been charged after shocking footage of a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train went viral, which even prompted a response from Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

A 17-year-old Brisbane man has been charged with two counts each of assault occasioning bodily harm and creating a nuisance on a railway.

He was further charged with one count each of threatening violence, common assault and using a carriage service to menace or harass.

An 18-year-old Ipswich man has also been charged with one count of creating a nuisance on a railway.

Shocking footage of an intoxicated young man hurling a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train

Both men are due to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.

On Saturday night, a video of the October 2 incident was posted on YouTube and went viral, which sparked a police investigation.

The video shows a drunk man, believed to be Kader Boumzar, screaming obscenities at a Queensland Rail security guard after he was told to take his feet off the seat about 11.50pm at Indooroopilly station on October 2.

The 17-year-old and an 18-year-old were questioned by detectives on Sunday afternoon before charges were laid.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the teenager in the video, labelling his behaviour as 'deplorable'.

Mr Abbott said he had been briefed about the incident, which he labelled as 'un-Australian', by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman.

'Just as I think it's un-Australian to defend death cults, I think it's un-Australian to abuse people in a public place just because you don't like the way they look, or you don't like the way they dress, or you make assumptions about what they believe,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Brisbane on Sunday.

Teenager Kader Boumzar took to Facebook on Sunday to apologise for hurling the racial abuse.

'I'm really sorry to everyone that was affected by the video I really can not remember anything out of all honesty the post made before was someone else I know this is no excuse,' he posted.

'But can you all see from my point of view that I was a f*****g idiot and I'm really sorry.' 

In the video - which attracted three million hits in under 24 hours - a 17-year-old man allegedly refers to a train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video.

'Do you want to come to Australia to learn some proper English?' the teenager said in the video.

'That is the issue c*** - learn some f*****g English 'cause this is Australia c*** because I can't understand you.'

'No, look, my n****r brother - I got my feet off the f*****g seat.'

He runs towards a door and speaks to another attendant before the guard approaches him again. 

'Don't touch me - I don't want to speak to you - I don't understand you,' the 17-year-old said.

'Bro, if you want to be a security guard, learn some English first.'

An attendant is heard telling the young man to 'get off' at the next stop.

Another security guard, wearing a blue top, is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker.

'I'm trying to get to the next station - l'll sit on this f*****g train for hours if I have to,' the teenager said.

'I'll hold all you f*****s up. I really don't care. Especially this black c***.

'Do you even have an Australian citizenship, you f*****g n****r?'

The person filming, who appears to be a friend of the teenager, is recording the incident, while he is heard laughing hysterically behind the camera.

'This n****r comes into my country and tells me to put my feet off the seat, when my feet are on the f*****g newspaper, you f*****g black dog,' the teenager continues in his video.

'What are you, Fijian or f*****g African c***. I hope all you n****r die.

The teenager starts clenching his fists towards the security guard as he says: 'Do you want to come off the train and fight me?'

As he continues to explode into a racist rant, other train passengers are heard in the video, mumbling words to the teenager, and he turns around and starts walking to them and says 'What?'

'What c***, you've got a problem too c***?'

The teenager starts walking through the carriage, and up to one of the commuters, who is seen wearing a dark blazer over a black top and brown pants. He tells him to 'get off the train' too.

'You have a problem too? Make me get off c***.'

The security guard walks over and stands in front of the commuters, as he gestures his hand to the passengers to stand back

The friend is heard mentioning about the security before the teenager continues and says: 'Nah, I don't give a f***. I have my feet on the f*****g newspaper.

'It wasn't on the seat, it was on the newspaper mate, alright? So if you want to cause a problem, then f*** you.'

His friend is heard laughing as he says: 'Let's go'.

But the teenager responds and says: 'No, no, no. I'm not done with this.'

Train passengers are seen looking outraged as Boumzar is uttering racial insults in front of them

One woman is heard in the background, saying: 'Some of us want to go home.'

While another man, wearing a dark blue t-shirt and a black cap, intervenes and says: 'Really?'

'Really? I f*****g work all day and I got to deal with this s***,' the man said.

'What the f*** is your story? Get the f*** out of the f*****g train man.'

The teenager responded: 'What the f*** c***, I'm trying to get to the f*****g next station c***.'

The man said: 'It's not really f*****g working is it?'. Then the teenager replied: 'Yeah, because of this black c***.'
