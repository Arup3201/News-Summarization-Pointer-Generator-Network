A 37-year-old man who ran away with a 15-year-old girl and sparked a state-wide search boasted two months ago that they shared a 'secret', it was revealed today.

Emily Lalinksy and Robert Messer were found in a Michigan field on Tuesday afternoon and each were taken to separate hospitals where they received treatment for dehydration and ‘superficial self-inflicted wounds’ to the wrist.

Lieutenant Cal Lauria told MailOnline: ‘Emily’s still in hospital. They were both dehydrated when they were found and they’re keeping her in a bit longer.’

Besotted: Messer posted this picture of Emily on Instagram boasting 'Looks like someone knows a secret'. He is now on suicide watch in custody after they were found after three days

Warning signs: Messer posted this montage on his Flickr page clearly setting out how smitten he was

Secret: Messer posted this picture of Emily on his Instagram account under #agapetos, which means 'beloved' in Greek

He said he was not authorized to comment on whether the wrist wounds found on both Emily and Messer were part of a suicide pact formed between the couple.

Messer is in police custody pending charges and has been placed on suicide watch.

Emily's mother is still reeling from the shocking disappearance on Sunday - completely unaware just how close the Messer, a family friend, had got to her daughter. 

But a search online shows that Messer at least was becoming increasingly brazen in his show of devotion. On his Instagram account two months ago he posted a picture of Emily with the caption: 'Looks like someone knows a secret'.

And alongside a picture of Emily posted three weeks ago in his account he wrote ‘agapetos’ a Greek word for ‘beloved.’

And on his Flickr page he produced a montage of pictures of Emily with the worrying caption: 'We have known each other for many days... but every day with you has been a great day'.

Yesterday Emily’s family spoke of their relief and delight that the teenager had been found.

Asked by text whether she was pleased to have her daughter home, Emily’s mother, Lisa Schwartz replied simply: ‘You betcha.’ She summed up the ordeal as ‘every parent’s nightmare.’ 

Emily and Messer were found in a field in Washtenaw County, near 7 Mile and Chubbs Road in Northville. 

Their discovery brought to an end a search that began when Emily vanished from her home in Plymouth Township four days ago.

During that time police had feared for her safety. Emily's mother had made public appeals for her safe return on television, during which she admitted: ‘I think once Bob realizes what he has done he might hurt himself and I don’t know where that would leave her.’

Speaking today from the family home in a quiet Plymouth neighborhood Lisa’s husband, Neil said: ‘Lisa’s priority now is Emily and looking after her.’

Relieved that the teen is back in her mother’s arms he reacted angrily to comments made by former neighbor, Donna Kelm, yesterday.

Mrs Kelm told MailOnline that she had seen Messer and Emily ‘kissing in his truck and holding hands,’ Mr Schwartz said: ‘If somebody saw something why didn’t they say anything? Why didn’t she tell us or report it to authorities.

‘I have no respect for somebody saying that now.’

He added: ‘I’ve only been in her life for the past couple of years but I’m telling you if we’d known something we’d have done something.’

As a family it is clear that the Schwartzs feel deeply betrayed by Messer, a man who has known Emily since she was a little girl and who Mrs Schwartz regarded as a ‘father figure’ for her six children.

Both Messer and the teenager left notes professing their love for each other, with Emily asking her mother to try not to blame herself.

Messer, recently divorced and father to a son, wrote: ‘We are in love and cannot be apart from each other.

Distress: Emily's mother, Lisa, and her new husband, Neil Schwartz, are delighted she is back home. However, Neil told MailOnline he is angered that a neighbor who claimed to have seen Emily and Messer kissing in a truck didn't report it to anyone

Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families

Desperate search: Police had been appealing to the public for help and received a number of tips that may have led them to the couple's hiding place

‘This is sad to us but our love, though we’ve had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of our lives. Please be happy for us.’

In a heartfelt note to her mother, Emily wrote: ‘You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I’m so sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would’ve done it.

‘Try not to be sad and don’t blame yourself, nothing could be done.’

Messer had become a friend of Emily’s mother when they met at church. ‘I trusted him,’ Schwartz told ABC7 at the height of her search for her daughter.

‘My whole family trusted him. My daughter trusted him. Bob was always like a brother to me.

‘Emily doesn’t have a dad, so she always looked up to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They’re both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.’

She said that far from feeling concern at Messer’s involvement in her teenage daughter’s life she had been grateful for the time he spent with her.

She said: ‘With me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with her, so he was like, “I’ll take her to Ann Arbor, I’ll take her to the Botanical Gardens.’
