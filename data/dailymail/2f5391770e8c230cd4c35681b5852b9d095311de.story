'Arrogance': EU commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Laszlo Andor says British politicians are pandering to prejudices and ignoring the benefits migrants bring

David Cameron is ‘pandering’ to xenophobes by seeking to limit the number of migrants from the EU – and the price to pay will be a rise in British taxes, the European Commission will say today.

In an outspoken assault on the Government’s demands to curb the free movement of people, Laszlo Andor – the Hungarian Employment Commissioner – said Brussels has been given ‘no evidence’ that benefits tourism is a widespread problem.

He accuses Britain of an ‘inappropriate over-reaction’ to the lifting of transition controls on Romania and Bulgaria.

And in a calculated rebuff to the Prime Minister, he will say that it is impossible for Britain to rewrite the free movement of workers around Europe – a key plank of the Mr Cameron’s plans to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum in 2017.

In a speech at the University of Bristol Mr Andor will say politicians are avoiding the ‘inconvenient truth’ that the ‘vast majority’ of migrants move to work and are an ‘asset’ to economies like the UK’s with an ageing population.

He will say: ‘Politicians should be responsible enough to talk about facts, rather than to pander to prejudice, or in the worst cases, xenophobia.

‘The truth, and indeed it might be inconvenient for some, is that they don’t do it in order to claim benefits. These workers are in fact of considerable benefit to the economies, and to the welfare systems, of the receiving countries.’

Mr Andor will add: ‘In the specific case of the UK, public debt would be much higher in the future without immigration because of the ageing population. Do people in the UK really want to pay higher taxes instead of immigration?’

The Government has already tightened the rules to limit the ‘pull factors’ in the benefits system which ministers believe has enticed Eastern European migrants to the UK.

Grant Shapps (left), the Conservative Party chairman, says Britain is trying to 'get a grip' on its borders. Mr Andor's comments are a swipe at Mr Cameron’s wider reform drive

New migrants from the European Economic Area will no longer be able to get housing benefit from April 2014 and they won’t be able to claim income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) until they have been in the country for three months.

And those who pass an Habitual Residence Test, will only be able to get JSA for six months. But Mr Andor will say he is yet to see evidence of widespread benefit tourism.

He will add: ‘In the case of the UK, I have been asking for such evidence to back up their claims for over two years but all that we have received is a series of anecdotes about cases of criminal fraud and vicars performing sham marriages.’

In a direct swipe at Mr Cameron’s wider reform drive, Mr Andor will say freedom of movement is ‘just one of the four freedoms on which the EU’s Single Market is based, along with free movement of goods, capital and services.

Member States cannot cherry pick which of the freedoms they want and leave the rest.’ The speech, which was briefed to journalists in advance, sparked fury last night.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Why Mr Andor thinks it’s his job to criticise the Government’s actions to get a grip of our borders is beyond me.

A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith added: ‘These attempts to interfere in the British welfare state are frankly tiresome.’

Tory MP Nick DeBois said: This intervention typifies the arrogance, remoteness and lack of accountability of the European Commission.’
