Lindsey Vonn held back a little bit in her first World Cup downhill training run in nearly a year, not wanting to push her surgically repaired right knee just yet.

She's saving that for race day.

The four-time overall World Cup champion showed flashes of her usual speed on Tuesday in Lake Louise, Alberta.

She picked up velocity midway through the course and finished in 1 minute, 54.41 seconds, which was 1.82 seconds behind Norway's Lotte Smiseth Sejersted.

Vonn is returning to competition after missing a year due to another torn cruciate ligament that caused her to sit out the Sochi Olympics.

Of competing again, Vonn said: 'I can't wait to race with all my ligaments intact for once.'

Vonn chases after her 15th career win at Lake Louise on Friday.
