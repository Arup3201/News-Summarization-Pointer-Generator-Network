A strip club DJ who performs under the name DJ Awesome allegedly hired his best friend to kill his own wife before embarking on a social media grieving campaign for her.

Andre Jason Pugh, 34, who lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia, was arrested Saturday and charged with murdering his wife, Tiffany, who was reportedly trying to divorce him.

He was booked into jail alongside his best friend Adrian Harley, whom police say he hired to break into their home and kill his wife with a gun on November 23.

Murdered: Tiffany Pugh was shot dead at her Atlanta home on November 23. Pugh called 911 when he found her, saying an intruder did it, but officers were suspicious of his story

Investigators say Pugh called 911 after coming home and finding his slain wife, telling operators that somebody must have broken in, according to Fox 5 News.

But officers did not believe his story and believe that he hired Harley, with whom he works at Onyx Atlanta, a strip club, to stage the break in and kill his wife.

The exact circumstances leading up to the killing remain unclear. 

According to one of the DJ's posts, the couple had been together 11 years and have a son and a daughter.

On the job: Pugh, shown above behind the turntables, posted social media updates talking about how he missed his wife. Days later he was arrested for her murder

On the day Tiffany Pugh was killed, Pugh posted to his Facebook page saying: 'Why did they take my wife?! My kids [sic] mom why?! Where did i go wrong?!'

Several days later he uploaded a message to his dead wife's Facebook profile, saying: 'I'm trying my best not to cry but seeing you in a state where I'm not used to it hurting me... I miss you love you and want you back so much.'  

A promotional DJ Awesome website says Pugh was born in The Bronx, New York City, and got his first set of turntables aged 13. 

He moved to Atlanta in the early 2000s and claims to have hosted numerous radio shows before starting at Onyx, a strip club on the outskirts of the city.

Pugh and Harley have both been charged with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit burglary, and murder. They are due in court Monday.

Members of Pugh's family told Fox 5 that they believe the allegations against him are false. 

'Where did I go wrong?!': Pugh, who changed his Facebook profile picture to an image of him with his wife, left, after her death, later posted messages to her profile saying he missed her

Work: Pugh played music as Onyx Atlanta, a strip club on the outskirts of the town
