Outcry: Lauren Pierce said the idea of assassinating President Barack Obama was tempting. She later apologised

A student Republican leader has been forced to apologise after saying the assassination of President Barack Obama was a 'tempting' idea.

Lauren Pierce, the president of the College Republicans at the University of Texas (UT), faces calls from her own group to resign after posting the comments on Twitter.

She said: 'Y'all as tempting as it may be, don't shoot Obama. We need him to go down in history as the WORST president we've EVER had! #2012.'

Her tweet, posted yesterday, came hours after Pennsylvania State Police arrested 21-year-old Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez in connection with the alleged gunfire incident at the White House last Friday.

Ortega-Hernandez was found by a state trooper at a hotel near Indiana, Pennsylvania, shortly after noon on Wednesday.

Just days earlier, bullets from an AK47 peppered the White House with one window close to the President's bedroom being cracked.

Police said that Ortega-Hernandez had become 'obsessed' with Obama and that God had given him a personal mission to attack the White House.

After the story of Miss Pierce's comment broke in the media, she told ABC News that the message was a 'joke'.

'Joke': Lauren's Pierce's inflammatory Twitter message, which she posted on Wednesday

Regret: Miss Pierce says she has learned valuable lessons since her first posting

She reportedly giggled while saying the attempted assassination would 'only make the situation worse'.

But amid growing attention, Miss Pierce removed the post and apologised on the social networking site for her comments.

In
separate tweets, she said: 'It was in poor taste and and should never 
have been written.

'It's never funny to joke about such a serious matter.
I have learned a very valuable lesson.'

Poor taste: Law enforcement personnel investigate the window which was hit by a bullet close to President Obama's bedroom. Miss Pierce made her comments hours after a man was arrested in connection with the shooting

Gathering speed: A timetable of the primary elections and caucuses in the lead-up to the presidential election on November 6 next year

The UT College Republicans in Austin have
asked Miss Pierce to resign because her comments were contrary to their
principles, the public relations director for the organisation told The
Texan Daily.

John Chapman said: 'Our message is to foster professional and respectful discussion at the University.

'Even though we might disagree with Obama, implying or attempting to commit violence is not positive, constructive or acceptable discussion.'

Miss Pierce was not available for comment on that issue.

Her Twitter postings come as Democratic incumbant Obama faces an uphill struggle to win re-election next year amid concerns over record unemployment levels and the damning economic situation.

But the Republicans have also had their problems after their attempts to choose a presidential candidate descended into farce with the sex assault allegations plaguing contender Herman Cain.

The series of Republican primary elections and caucuses kicks off on January 3 in the run-up to the presidential vote on November 6 next year.
