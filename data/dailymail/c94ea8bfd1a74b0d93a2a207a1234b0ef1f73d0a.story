For years, Ulrika Jonsson has been lumbered with the scornful nickname 4x4, for giving birth to four children by four different fathers. 

But the former weather presenter announced today that she has now become a 4x3 after her most recent husband Brian Monet adopted her eldest daughter Bo, 13.

Ulrika, 47, took her whole family to Oxford County Court earlier this month to witness a judge hand over a certificate officially naming Brian as Bo's father.

She told The Sun: 'When the judge granted the order, Brian and I wept. We rushed home to tell Bo, who was so happy.

'It is hard to put into words what this means to us, now Bo has someone who has truly earned the right to be her father.

'You can never expect someone to love your children unconditionally as you do yourself, but Brian does.

'Nothing has changed in our day-to-day lives but deep down there is such contentment, a relief on my part and reassurance for Bo, our family is stronger than ever.'

Bo's biological father is the German hotel boss Markus Kempen, who Ulrika dated for a short while at the turn of the century.

But just days after Bo was born in November 2000, the businessman told his girlfriend that he was leaving the UK to find work abroad - Ulrika hadn't even taken their child home from the hospital by then. 

When four years later, Ulrika met her current husband Brian, the American advertising executive raised Bo as if she were his own.

But until now, the family haven't seen fit to make the relationship legal. 

The wheels only started to be put into motion when the teen approached her mother last autumn and asked if she thought Brian would be interested in adopting her. 

According to Ulrika, Brian was so touched that he started to cry. 

The couple then had to start the exhausting adoption process through social services, that included witness statements, referees, visits to their home and the agreement of Bo's biological father Marcus.

Then, almost nine months after the procedure began, a judge granted the order and Bo now goes by the name Bo Jonsson Monet. 

It is a happily ever after ending for Ulrika, who has until she met Brian was always unlucky in love.  

In 1990, she married cameraman John Turnbull in 1990 and four years later they gave birth to Ulrika's eldest son Cameron, now 19, but the couple then divorced a year later.

Her next serious relationship was with the footballer Stan Collymore, which ended with him violently assaulting her in 1998 after they started arguing in a bar in Paris. 

It was soon after this that her romance started with Bo's father Marcus Kempen, which ended shortly after Ulrika gave birth.

In between this split and meeting her third husband, Ulrika then engaged in a brief relationship with Sven-Göran Eriksson while he was manager of the England football team.

She then met her second husband Lance Gerrard-Wright on the 2002 TV dating show Mr Right while presenting the programme and a whirlwind romance saw the pair marry in August 2003, with their daughter Martha being born in 2004. 

Sadly, the couple split a year later but Lance continues to have a good relationship with his daughter, with Ulrika describing Martha as the apple of his eye.

Then finally in 2006, Ulrika met Brian Monet and they were married in March 2008, with her fourth child Malcolm born three months later in June of that year. 

While the TV star has now spoken of her joy that her daughter Bo has been officially adopted by Brian and announced that she is now a 4x3 instead of a 4x4, she has always been very outspoken about the attitudes the general public has to her family situation.

She told The Mail in 2011: 'Being labelled a 4x4 does not bother me in the slightest, but the chances are you are not going to believe me.

'Truth is, when it first emerged that I was expecting my fourth child by as many men three years ago, I had to admit to myself that the branding was not only innovative but rather apt. 

'It rolled off my thick skin like water off a pregnant duck's back.

'(But) many cruel jokes and jibes later I am still questioning why my domestic situation has been the subject of so much vitriol and disapproval.

'After all, plenty of men - many of them famous - father children by a host of different women, and they are treated like loveable, if randy, old goats.

'But women like me, whose romantic dreams may have fallen apart - but who work ferociously hard to provide stable loving homes for their offspring - are vilified.

'Functional, beautiful, well-adjusted children can come out of broken situations. And in my case it is thanks to the contributions made by the fathers who take the same responsibility as I have.

So please save your criticism of the women who love and nurture their children and direct it at the men who fail to be fathers and prefer, instead, to play Father Christmas once a month.

I have four fantastic children with three fantastic fathers. And in the words of Meatloaf, if he wouldn't mind re-writing his song, 'three out of four ain't bad...'
