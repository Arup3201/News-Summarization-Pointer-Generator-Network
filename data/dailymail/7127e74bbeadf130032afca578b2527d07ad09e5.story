Hundreds of people fell ill with a stomach virus on an 11-day Royal Caribbean International cruise ship that returned to South Florida Friday.

The cruise line reported that 105 of nearly 2,000 passengers were sickened with possible Norovirus, as well as 3 of 772 crew members. The ship captain announced the outbreak shortly after the vessel, called the 'Vision of the Seas,' departed. Dozens of passengers experiencing the symptoms were quarantined.

One of those passengers was Johnny Celaire, who said he caught the virus early on and spent the duration of the trip separated from his wife in the quarantined portion of the ship.

Outbreak: Hundreds of people fell ill with a stomach virus on an 11-day Royal Caribbean International cruise ship that returned to South Florida Friday

Not happy: 'It¿s been a hell of an experience,' passenger Johnny Celaire said of the trip

'It’s been a hell of an experience,' Celaire told CBS Miami. 'I thought I had motion sickness. I assumed because we had rough ocean coming in for about one hour. It was after that when I got diarrhea I said, "Oh boy, I’ve really got that sucker now."'

The outbreak is the second time in a month that a luxury cruise has gone awry.

Last month, thousands of passengers 
spent nearly five days on a disabled cruise ship operated by Carnival 
Corp in the Gulf of Mexico.

Carnival's
Triumph was returning to Galveston, Texas from Cozumel, Mexico, on the 
third day of a four-day cruise when an engine-room fire knocked out 
power and plumbing across most of the ship.

Celaire and his wife, Joan Webber, said they saw crew members trying to sanitize every inch of the ship but the virus was so contagious, it couldn't be contained. 

'We saw them wiping down all the railings,' Webber said. 'I mean they’ve done well at trying to contain it, but it’s just gone wild.'

Norovirus is highly contagious and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting. The disease typically lasts only a few days but can be prolonged without proper hydration.

Infected: Joan Webber said she didn't begin feeling the symptoms of the virus until Friday, so she wasn't quarantined

Cleaning: The cruise ship was sanitized on Friday and set to depart for another cruise

It is easily spread through infected 
people by direct contact with food, water or any type of surface such as
a railing or doorknob.

Webber
said she didn't begin feeling the symptoms of the virus until Friday, 
so she wasn't quarantined. She said she was concerned about all the 
infected passengers who will be traveling by cab to local hotels or by 
plane back home.

'There are people flying out today that are going on an aircraft that have diarrhea so bad they don’t know how they are going to get back up to Canada,' Webber said. 'I’m surprised we didn’t go and have the health department talk to us.'

The cruise line said in a statement that crew members conducted enhanced cleaning to help prevent the spread of the illness. After returning to port, crew members aboard the Vision of the Seas conducted an extensive and thorough sanitizing on board the ship and within the cruise terminal to help prevent future illness, according to the statement.

Built to impress: The 915-foot-long Vision of the Seas can accommodate 2,416 guests and 742 crew members

The vessel was ending an 11-night Caribbean cruise that left Port Everglades on Feb. 25. Its previous port of call was Aruba on March 5

Norovirus outbreaks are fairly frequent 
on cruise ships. In December, some 194 passengers and 11 crew members 
aboard the luxury cruise ship Queen Mary 2 were sickened and suffered 
from vomiting and diarrhea.

In 2012, including the Queen Mary 2 incident, a total of 16 outbreaks on cruise ships were reported to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, up from 14 in 2011. Vessels are required to notify the agency when 2 percent of those on board develop a gastrointestinal illness.

In January 2012, the Costa Concordia operated by Carnival Corp ran aground off the Italian coast and killed 32 passengers.

The 915-foot-long Vision of the Seas can accommodate 2,416 guests and 742 crew members. The vessel was ending an 11-night Caribbean cruise that left Port Everglades on Feb. 25. Its previous port of call was Aruba on March 5.

The ship and the cruise terminal have been thoroughly sanitized and Vision of the Seas will depart later on Friday as scheduled, the company said.
