George Osborne has urged northern cities to adopt Boris Johnson-style elected mayors – just two years after thousands of voters said they did not want them.

The Chancellor offered cities ‘serious devolution of powers and budgets’ if they agree to vest authority in directly elected figure like the Mayor of London.

The pledge comes despite the fact that voters in 2012 across the north delivered the government a humiliating blow by throwing out plans for elected mayors.

Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford and Wakefield all rejected the idea in referendums.

In Manchester yesterday Mr Osborne said he is ready to offer a bigger carrot in terms of local decision-making power to tempt the cities to reconsider.

His offer came as he set out his vision of an economic ‘powerhouse’ in the north of England, with a high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds.

The Chancellor said the combined economic and creative energies of northern cities could compete on a global scale. Bringing the cities of the north together could create a second ‘global city’ for the UK, which would be not a rival but a ‘brother in arms’ for London as they fight to grow Britain’s share in the world economy, he said.

But he set no timescale on the high-speed rail line – dubbed HS3 – or give any indication about its route. Mr Osborne said there was a ‘strong case’ for more elected mayors who could drive growth and development in northern cities.

‘A true powerhouse requires true power,’ he said. ‘So today I am … starting the conversation about serious devolution of powers and budgets for any city that wants to move to a new model of city government – and have an elected mayor.’

Mr Osborne said the northern cities should consider the value to London of having a strong and globally-recognised city leader in Boris Johnson – ‘the haircut that is recognised all over the world’. ‘Wales has its own parliament, and can pass its own laws. The economies of Manchester and Leeds are each individually bigger than Wales. But they don’t have a single leader who can speak for the whole area.’

The Chancellor’s vision of a high speed rail link was praised by Labour figures in the north last night – but attacked by Shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

The mayor of Liverpool welcomed the Chancellor’s ‘bold step’, while the leader of Leeds council, Keith Wakefield, said: ‘I’m delighted George Osborne appears to be listening to the leaders of northern cities and accepting the role our cities have to play in the national economy.’

But Mr Balls said: ‘The Tories scrapped Labour’s successful regional development agencies, failed to implement Lord Heseltine’s growth report and are planning to cut infrastructure investment next year.’

Lord Prescott said that much of Mr Osborne’s vision echoed the Northern Way initiative, which he launched in 2004 to drive growth across the region.

‘This is more about northern votes than northern growth,’ he said Lord Prescott.
