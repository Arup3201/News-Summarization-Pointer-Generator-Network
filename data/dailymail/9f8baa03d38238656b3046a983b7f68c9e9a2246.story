Less than 24 hours before one of the biggest-ever FA Cup giant-killings, Bradford's players are sitting in Kensington's Marriott Hotel watching Celebrity Big Brother.

There are more enthralling ways to spend Friday night in London, but for these players the excitement is all to come. Two down against Chelsea on Saturday, the League One side mustered a glorious comeback, scoring four times to leave Jose Mourinho's hopes of an historic quadruple in tatters and the Chelsea boss talking of being 'ashamed'.

But how did this team of free transfers pull it off?

4 - Bradford became the fourth opponents to score four goals against a team coached by Mourinho after Barcelona (2010, 0-5), Borussia Dortmund (2013, 1-4) and Tottenham (2015, 3-5). The Bantams are the first team ever to do it away from home.

2008 - The last time Chelsea lost to a lower league team in the FA Cup was against Barnsley in 2008.

Jon Stead has scored four goals and assisted four in his last five FA Cup games.

1 - This is the first time Chelsea have conceded more than two goals at home this season in all competitions.

£7,500 - Striker James Hanson is the only Bradford player to command a fee, £7,500. In contrast, Chelsea’s starting line-up cost a whopping £101million.

10 - Mourinho’s side have conceded 10 goals in 2015 — only four teams in the Premier League, Championship, League One and League Two have let in more in the same period.

Former Chelsea winger Filipe Morais  has scored three goals and provided two assists in his last five FA Cup games for Bradford.

1958 - Chelsea conceded four goals to a third-tier team for the first time since 1958, when they lost 4-1 to Darlington — the goals coming from Tommy Moran (two), Ron Harbertson and Dave Carr.

Parkinson started devising his Stamford Bridge blueprint on Thursday, taking shape and tactical sessions aimed at nullifying Chelsea's threat. Midfielder Filipe Morais said: 'We had an idea they might rest a few players and that gave us more confidence.'

Parkinson informed his squad of the starting line-up after Friday morning's training session and they arrived in Kensington at 5.30pm.

They sat down for dinner in the plush hotel restaurant at 6.30pm, when players were given a choice of steak, pasta or chicken, and whisper it, a small bowl of apple crumble and custard.

With no curfew, players retreated to their rooms to watch Cambridge v Manchester United. Some, though, found themselves switching over midway through the clash at Abbey Road to Channel 5 for some lighter viewing.

Those who stuck with the football were impressed by Cambridge's gutsy display in securing a goalless draw. 'They were hungry and I took great inspiration watching them,' revealed Morais.

Bradford's soon-to-be heroes were back in the hotel restaurant between 8am-10am for breakfast before congregating in the lobby at 11.30pm for a 10-minute pre-match walk around Kensington.

Some did impressions of Jose Mourinho to ease their nerves, while goalkeeping coach Lee Butler — very much the joker in the Bradford pack — did his utmost to keep the players relaxed.

Bradford had lunch at the hotel at 11.45am before setting off for Stamford Bridge at 1.15pm.

As they got caught in some light Fulham Road traffic they were confronted with a heart-warming ice-breaker as thousands of Bradford fans, enjoying a few pre match beverages, swarmed the coach to provide the loudest of good luck messages.

Arriving at Stamford Bridge at 1.30pm, some stayed in dressing room until the warm-up, while others immediately took a stroll on to the pitch to soak in the growing atmosphere.

Some of the Bradford squad watched Cambridge's draw with Man United and took inspiration from the result 

Parkinson re-iterated his side's gameplan in the team talk 10 minutes before kick-off - to break down the flanks, not to run through the middle of Chelsea, to hit diagonal balls into tall forward James Hanson allowing attacking midfielder Billy Knott to pick up second balls, not to press all over the pitch but only in their own half and to minimize any risk taking.

Then it was time for Parkinson to inspire; ordering his charges to believe in themselves, convincing them they were fitter than Chelsea.

'We were all in their wishing each other luck, it was really genuine,' said Morais.

'At some clubs you'll see players just tap someone and say 'good luck' and not really mean it. But we were all shaking hands and hugging and we meant it.'

And there was even time for one more wise crack when one player's over-zealous attempts to gee-up his team-mates with some rather colourful language prompted substitute Alan Sheehan to tell his team-mate to calm down, prompting a huge ripple of laughter. 

As they opened the door into the tunnel, Chelsea were already waiting for them.

For Morais, who played in Mourinho's first ever game as Chelsea manager, this was a poignant moment. But his attempts to remain focused were scuppered by his old mentor.

'As I come out I hear a scream of: "Filipe Morais" in a Portuguese accent. It's Jose,' said Morais.

'I didn't know where to look. I said: "Hello Mister" which is gaffer in Portuguese. He shook my hand, gave me a hug and said to me you're 29 now, you're a big man.

'At that time I didn't want to see him because I was so focused. That's just Jose.'

After the first 39 minutes, you could forgive Morais for fearing that his impromptu reunion with Mourinho would be the highlight of his afternoon as Chelsea raced into a 2-0 lead.

But Jon Stead's phenomenal strike before half-time changed the game's complexion. And then came the moment that will remain with Morais for the rest of his life.

Here it is in his own words: 'It was an easy tap in but it was crazy. I dreamt about it twice in the week.

'Before the game I thought I wouldn't celebrate scoring against Chelsea. In my mind I didn't know what to do, but my overriding emotion was that I scored for Bradford, they deserve my passion.'

'We could sense the tide was changing, we could smell it,' said Morais.

Indeed it was, two more goals and Bradford were legends.

Even Mourinho got caught up in the romance of it, making his way into the visiting dressing room telling the players that the achievement could never be taken from them before shaking the all coaching staff's hands.

Morais' night ended with Eden Hazard's shirt and a meal in the Marco Pierre White restaurant on the Stamford Bridge site.
