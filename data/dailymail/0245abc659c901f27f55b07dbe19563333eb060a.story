Abdul Murshid, 46, claimed more than £55,000 in housing benefit that he was not entitled to over more than six years

A petrol station worker who illegally claimed more than £55,000 in housing benefit and blew it all on holidays and parties has been jailed.

Abdul Murshid, 46, claimed £700 a month in state handouts that he was not entitled while working at a Welcome Break service station on the M1.

The father-of-four fraudulently claimed the benefits for more than six years before he was finally caught.

Willesden Magistrates' Court heard how Murshid, who worked at the services near Edgware, North London, claimed £55,597.31 in benefits for rent on a property he part-owned. 

Murshid, from Harrow, north-west London, was jailed for 11 weeks for the 'severe' fraud over a 'substantial period of time'.

The married man, who has two boys, aged 12 and nine, and two girls, aged six and two, was also ordered to repay all of the money. 

A Harrow Council spokesman said: 'Petrol station attendant Abdul Murshid was jailed for 11 weeks after a court heard how he lied about his arrangements to falsely claim £55,000 in housing benefits. 

'The court heard that [he] used the £700 to spend on his family in a fraud that extended over more than six years. 

'Magistrates said a jail term was justified because of the severity and duration of the fraud.

'In total, £55,957.31 was claimed fraudulently from October 2005 to March 2012 and Harrow Council will now seek to recoup the money.'

Harrow councillor Sachin Shah said: 'People defrauding the benefit system take attention away from its real purpose.

'That purpose is to provide a vital safety net that catches people when they need it the most.

'A jail term sends a signal of just how seriously the courts take benefit fraud - it is not a harmless paperwork fiddle.

'We are going to pursue the defendant to recover money which belongs to the people of Harrow.'
