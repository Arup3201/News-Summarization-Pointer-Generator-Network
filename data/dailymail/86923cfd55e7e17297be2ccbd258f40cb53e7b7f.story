Diego Simeone is keen for his players to concentrate on the league this weekend after an impressive showing in the Champions League.

Atletico Madrid beat Bayer Leverkusen on penalties to secure a quarter-final berth on Tuesday, and were subsequently drawn against Real Madrid, but Simeone was keen to downplay the fixture.

The Argentinian has urged his players to focus on their Primera Division campaign having failed to hit the heights of last year, with last week's goalless draw with Espanyol leaving the champions fourth in the table.

Atletico sit fourth in La Liga and they will now have to turn their attention following a European win

'Now our life is La Liga, to continue fighting to make sure we don't exit the battle with Valencia and Sevilla. We need to be clear that our match is (against) Getafe,' he said on as.com.

'We must be clear that it is an intense match, that requires us to play to achieve the victory. It must be sought from the start.'

Simeone hinted that he may be forced into resting several players after the exertions of Tuesday night. Mario Mandzukic, Miguel Angel Moya and Raul Garcia have been left out of the travelling squad, while Miranda is absent after he was sent off against Espanyol.

Getafe will go into the game with a clear game plan, according to Pablo Franco, with the coach admitting he expects Atletico to be on a high following their midweek win.

Franco's men sneaked their first away win in eight games at Cordoba two weeks ago, but their form has been inconsistent and leaves them 13th in the table.

'They are a great team, victory the other day reinforces them even more, so we must be clear that tomorrow we will go for broke,' he told getafecf.com.
