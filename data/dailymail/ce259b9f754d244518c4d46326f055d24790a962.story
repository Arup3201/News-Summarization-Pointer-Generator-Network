When U.S. Army chiefs told a Marine division to drum up a spot of healthy rivalry with South Korea earlier this month ... they took the order quite literally.

The Third Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEP) was attending the 2014 Gyeryong Military Culture Festival, South Korea, when it sent its marching band into battle against its South Korean counterpart.

What followed was a cacophony of drum-rolls and symbol-clanging of a skill-level only a trained military outfit could achieve.

South Korea: What followed was a cacophony of drum-rolls and symbol-clanging of a level of skill only a trained military outfit could achieve. First to play was the Army of South Korea (pictured)

First to play was the Republic of Korea Army Band.

Their five-man band had crowds whooping with excitement as they played their arrangement with rhythm and aplomb.

Then it was the turn of III MEP. 

To the untrained ear their tune may have sounded identical to the one heard moments earlier, but to the crowds in situ it was a feast of percussive sound.

Cheeky: Egged on by the cheering congregation, the marines approached their foes until their instruments were almost touching and cheekily drummed their drums as well as their own.

End in a draw: At the end there could only be one winner, though the Marine adjudicator magnanimously called a draw

Egged on by the cheering congregation, the marines approached their foes until their instruments were almost touching and cheekily drummed their drums  as well as their own.

At the end there was only one winner, though the Marine adjudicator magnanimously called a draw.

The video, filmed by Benito Hijar, a trombone instrumentalist with III MEP, has gone viral since being uploaded on October 9 and has amassed almost 2.5 million views.

'Marines bringing the heat!' echoed another. 

The Gyeryong Military Culture Festival is one of the many performances that the Okinawa, Japan-based III Marine Expeditionary Force Band takes part in across the world.
