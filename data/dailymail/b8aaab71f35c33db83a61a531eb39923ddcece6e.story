Switzerland's last wild bear has been shot and killed after fears it posed a threat to humans.

The brown bear, affectionately known as Mike, had started to follow people during the day looking for food and was seen regularly near a school, the Swiss Federal Environment Office said.

Sightings, including the time he was hit by a train on the local Rhaetian Railway, meant Mike became a regular fixture in the Swiss tabloids and there was even a Twitter account set up in his name.

But Swiss federal authorities confirmed the bear had been shot by gamekeepers on Tuesday in Poschiavo Valley, in The Alps, near the Italian border.

Problems began at the end of last year when Mike, whose official name was M13, broke into a home in Graubuenden.

He was fitted with a radio collar and monitored daily.Â 

But recently the bear had begun to show little fear of humans again after waking up from hibernation.

The Swiss environment office released a statement yesterday which read: 'The bear M13 had certainly never showed any aggression toward man, but the risk that an accident might happen and that people might be badly injured or killed had become intolerable.

'In order to give the bear population a chance to reestablish itself in Switzerland, circumstances sometimes arise when unfortunately an individual must be killed.'

However, M13 supporters have taken to social network sites, Facebook and Twitter, to express their grief and outrage at the shooting.

Some believe the bear should have been relocated or placed in a zoo rather than shot.

According to the Swiss Federal Environment Office, M13 was one of about 40 bears which originated in the Trentin area of Italy. It is believed it had wandered over the Italian border.

But the Swiss-based World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) condemned the shooting, saying wardens should have instead intensified efforts to frighten the animal away from populated areas.

Several brown bears, including two called M12 and M14 who had been identified as Mike's brothers, have also been known to roam between Switzerland, Austria and Italy. M14 died last year when he was hit by a car.

The Swiss authorities were keen to see the return of the bear, hunted to extinction along with wolves and lynxes in the Alps in the 19th century.

In 2005 they to set aside land in the south-east of the country, in the hope it might offer a corridor for bears to spread from northern Italy.

But farmers saw the return as a threat to their livestock.

The Swiss capital, Bern, is named after a bear - although its medieval founder was inspired by the first animal he killed during a day out hunting.
