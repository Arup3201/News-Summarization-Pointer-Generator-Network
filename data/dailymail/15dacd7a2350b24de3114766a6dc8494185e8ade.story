Traditional British rituals like eating a takeaway in front of the TV, or driving the short distance to work are killing us and need to be challenged.

Greater public health interventions, similar to the smoking ban, are vital if society is to wage war on rising obesity levels, and combat related diseases including cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

Smoking and drinking alcohol are social habits that must be tackled by public health officials.

A team of social scientists believe, only by making certain unhealthy lifestyle choices socially unacceptable, will progress be made.  

Dr Stanley Blue, a lecturer in social sciences at Manchester University said some social practices reinforce each other, such as getting a takeaway and watching TV on a Friday night.

Traditional British rituals like eating a takeaway in front of the telly need to be made socially unacceptable in order to tackle 'lifestyle' diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes, social scientists argue

Others - such as drinking a bottle of wine at home or going to the gym - compete for time in our busy days.

Legislation outlawing smoking in public places means a packet of cigarettes no longer goes hand in hand with a visit to a pub or restaurant.

A similar approach, with social practice at the heart of public health policy, could be taken to eating and exercise, he said.

This is instead of traditional methods which rely on persuading people to make the 'right' decision by going to the gym or eating their five-a-day.

These treat such decisions as matters of personal choice, ignoring the fact social habits and practices are blindly leading us into bad health.

Dr Blue said: 'Smoking, exercise and eating are fundamentally social practices, therefore we need to reshape what is deemed socially acceptable and normal in order to change them.

'It is about shifting the emphasis. An example is the way having a Friday night takeaway watching the TV has become the social norm, whereas encouraging people to acquire the skills to cook fresh food themselves may dissuade them from this regular routine.

'Also, some people find cooking very enjoyable and it becomes part of the family evening and entertainment, rather than a chore, making fast food less socially acceptable.

'With cycling initiatives the Government can also persuade people that getting on their bike to work is actually a better and safer way to travel, rather than driving through cities.

'The smoking legislation is a good example where attitudes and behaviour have changed, without the product actually being banned.'

Research last year found the average British person now forks out £110 a month on takeaway meals - a staggering £1,320 a year.

Schemes encouraging cycling to work instead of driving, or cooking at home instead of getting a takeaway may be more effective than assuming people will make the 'right' decision about their health, they said

Men have the biggest taste for fast food. They get through an extraordinary 151 takeaways a year, while the figure for women is 126.

Writing in the journal Critical Public Health, Dr Blue and colleagues said new ideas are needed to tackle non communicable, or 'lifestyle', diseases.

They cite the smoking ban as an example of a measure that effectively decoupled the relationship between going out for a meal or a drink and having a cigarette.

Dr Blue added: 'Current public health policy is dominated by the presumption that individuals are capable of making 'better' choices for themselves on the basis of information given to them by the government or other agencies.

'This does not account for the fact that practices like those of smoking and eating have histories of their own.

'Trying to get individuals to stop smoking or eat healthily overlooks the fact that these are fundamentally social practices.

'Public health policy will have to find the courage to break away from its traditional mould if it is to stand a chance of confronting the grim reaper of lifestyle diseases.'

But these are social practices so preaching about being healthy won't work
