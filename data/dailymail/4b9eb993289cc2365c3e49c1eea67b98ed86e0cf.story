Diarist Anne Frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the Holocaust, according to new research.

It was previously believed that the Jewish teenager, who was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, died of typhus on 31 March 1945, two weeks before the camp was liberated.

However a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid February, meaning that even if British troops had reached the camp a little sooner, she would likely not have survived.

Anne's diary, which documents how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War, became a bestseller when it was published after then end of the war.

The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house, but were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister perished.

Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. 

By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped.

In 1942 the family went into hiding in secret rooms of Otto Frank's office building.

But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945.

Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame.

After the war the Dutch government set the official date of her death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March.

Because the Allies liberated the camp on April 15, this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved.

However, Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum, has now revised that date having studied witness accounts, archives, and conducted at least one new interview.

Ms Prins said she now believes that Anne and her sister began exhibiting symptoms of typhus at the beginning of February.

According to Dutch health authorities, most patients do not live for more than 12 days after that.

'In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,' the study says. 

Ms Prins added: 'It was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is. But when you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. 

Bergen-Belsen was liberated in April 1945, meaning if Anne died in March, then she was two weeks from rescue. But this new study shows she was months from safety (Anne pictured left, with father Otto, and right)

Anne and her sister Margot died during a typhus epidemic that swept through the Bergen-Belsen camp in 1945, killing an estimated 35,000 people (pictured, typhus patients inside the camp)

'So maybe if they'd lived two more weeks... well, that's not true anymore.'

It is unlikely that the exact date of Anne's death will ever be uncovered, as disease was so common in the camps that individuals passing away often went unnoticed.

In the words of one witness, Rachel van Amerongen, who knew the Frank sisters and was cited by researchers, 'one day they simply weren't there anymore.'

Anne and Margot were just two of an estimated 35,000 deaths at Bergen-Belsen when a typhus epidemic swept through the camp in early 1945.
