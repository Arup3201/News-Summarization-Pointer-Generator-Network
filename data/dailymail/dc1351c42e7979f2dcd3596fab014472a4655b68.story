Veteran Hull goalkeeper Steve Harper is 'open-minded' about his future.

The 39-year-old is currently injured after struggling to fully recover from a bicep problem but has not given up hope of returning to the first team.

The former Newcastle stopper managed 19 matches in his maiden season at the KC Stadium and has made another four this term following number one Allan McGregor's own fitness issues.

He is understood to have pondered retirement in the summer and is thought to be keen on management, but is currently focused on helping the Tigers before deciding what to do next year.

'I'm 40 in March and while I don't feel it I realise nothing lasts for life,' he told the Newcastle Chronicle.

'I'm really open-minded about what I do next.

'Right now, my one concern is to get back on the field and play as many matches as I can for Hull.

'I hate being injured and at my age I can't afford to be, so I rushed back, played against Burnley, and aggravated my bicep and shoulder again. But I'll return very shortly and then there is half a season still to go.'
