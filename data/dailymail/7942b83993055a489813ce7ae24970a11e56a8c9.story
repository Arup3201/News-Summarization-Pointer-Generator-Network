She is the mystery party girl seen cavorting with Sally Bercow – wife of the Speaker of the House of  Commons – in the back of a London cab last week.

But The Mail on Sunday can reveal today that the woman shown draping her leg across Mrs Bercow’s lap is her best friend and drinking companion Farah Sassoon – a wealthy businesswoman and Labour donor.

Until now, Mrs Sassoon’s glamorous daughter Sophia, an actress and model who starred in hit reality TV show Made In Chelsea, has been  better known than her mother.

But pictures of Mrs Bercow and Farah Sassoon after leaving an awards ceremony have changed  all that.

Mrs Bercow and Mrs Sassoon, who married hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns, are so close that Mrs Sassoon, 48, has been given a special security pass to the Houses of  Parliament, allowing her to bypass strict security checks.

The two are familiar figures in  the watering holes of Westminster, where they have been seen drinking champagne until late at night.

But they have more in common than just partying. Although Mrs Bercow’s husband had a long career in the Tory Party before becoming Speaker, she is a vocal Labour  supporter.

Her views are shared by Mrs Sassoon, who has given more than £40,000 to the party – including a £4,200 donation to Ed Miliband’s leadership campaign in 2010.

Just weeks ago, Mrs Sassoon was spotted with Mrs Bercow chatting to the Labour leader on the Commons Terrace.

Her security pass derives from the special status of the Bercows as some of the few people who live in the Palace of Westminster.

They occupy a palatial grace-and-favour apartment overlooking the Thames and are allowed to grant a few passes to ‘friends and family’.

While other visitors must go through stringent and lengthy airport-style checks to gain entry to the Palace of Westminster, Mrs  Sassoon can walk straight in by showing her pass, just like MPs.

MPs say they have often seen the two women laughing in Commons bars in recent months. ‘They look like a couple of ladettes out to have some fun,’ said one.

‘They can be relied on to provide entertainment for some of the fuddy duddies here.’

Identified only as a ‘female  companion’ of Mrs Bercow, Mrs Sassoon was photographed with  her friend after they left an  awards ceremony for gay magazine Attitude at the Royal Courts of  Justice.

Mrs Sassoon was shown throwing her leg across the Speaker’s wife’s lap.

Mrs Sassoon owns a ‘specialist’ hotel and conference-booking  company – Trust Reservations –  which has close commercial links  to Labour.

One of her biggest contracts is arranging hotel rooms for Labour delegates at its annual conferences.

The company’s website boasts a picture of a Labour rally featuring deputy leader Harriet Harman and ex-union boss and Labour MP  husband Jack Dromey.

Since 2007, Trust Reservations has given more than £35,000 in cash and ‘staff costs’ to Labour. In 2010, the company made a  separate £4,200 donation to Mr  Miliband’s leadership campaign.

Records show that the money was received three months after he was elected Labour leader. A Labour spokesman declined to discuss the company’s business connections with the party.Mrs Sassoon was unavailable for comment last night.
