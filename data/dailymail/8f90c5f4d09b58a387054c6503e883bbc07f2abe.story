A Georgia student is recovering after being being punched so badly by a fellow student that his nose was broken off of his skull.Â 

David Egan, 16, was captured on a cell phone video getting punched in the face by his attacker in a locker room at Parkview High School in Gwinnett County. After stumbling from the blow into some lockers, Egan was punched again and fell to the ground.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Egan's injuries required hours of emergency facial surgery, WGCL reports.

'[David] had fractures all over his cheekbone, fractures which require a metal plate to constructively hold the bones back together, and the whole base of his nose was broken to the side of his face,' father Daniel Egan told the channel. 'His eyes were completely swollen shut.'

Daniel Egan also said that the school called him to pick up David, as opposed to calling an ambulance for his son.

Meanwhile, son David Egan says he doesn't even know the student who punched him, and that he was confronted over rumors that he stole the other student's sneakers.

'When he first hit me I actually said out loud, "Wow, you actually sucker-punched me?" because it was just crazy that he actually did that,' Egan told WGCL.

He also told the channel that when he fell, others in the locker room jumped, cheered and laughed at him.

Egan is now forced to miss school indefinitely.

'I just want him to get punished for what he did because he wrongfully attacked me. And I didn't know him. I just wanted to get on with my life. I didn't ask for any of this,' he said to WGCL.

Egan's attacker has been charged with aggravated battery -- but his father is not happy that the student has been charged as a juvenile.

Daniel Egan wants Gwinnett County School Police to charge the student with a more serious charge, WSBTV reports -- and insists the attack on his son was premeditated.

'When they treat it like a school yard shuffle, you are thinking these are just kids,' Daniel Egan told WSBTV. 'He didn't throw sand in his eyes, he didn't stab him in the arm with a pencil, he broke his skull.'

Meanwhile, school district spokesman Jorge Quintana said 'the school handled this case well' in a written statement to the channel.

'The student is a juvenile. I understand that this offense does not qualify to charge a juvenile as an adult in the state of Georgia,' Quintana said.

'Typically when there is a fight, 911 is not called as adults intervene. Injured students are typically taken to the clinic to receive immediate care from the clinic worker. Parents are then called. The school handled this case well, acting immediately to care for the injured student and to investigate so that appropriate disciplinary and criminal charges could be made.'

The Egan family planned to meet with an attorney.
