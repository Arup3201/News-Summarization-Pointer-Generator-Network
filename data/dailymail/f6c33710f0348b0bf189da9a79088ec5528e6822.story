While fashion most often celebrates clothes that are visible on the outside, a new exhibit diverges from the norm by focusing on what’s worn underneath.

The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology’s new show ‘Exposed: A History of Lingerie’ explores the evolution of underpinnings from the 18th century to modern day.

In doing so, the exhibit's 70-some artifacts uncover how the shape and tone of clothing has shifted as a result – tracing the differences in color, shape, and idealized body forms along the way.

Tracing history: The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology's new exhibit Exposed: A History of Lingerie, traces the evolution of underpinnings throughout time (pictured, a 1951 Christian Dior petticoat and a 1949 Poirette bra exemplify the mid century feminine form)

Exercising restraint: Throughout time, lingerie has yo-yo'd between phases of freedom and constriction, the latter of which is the case with these two corsets (pictured, a Waneris design circa 1960, left, and a 1954 Marie Rose Lebigot for Lily of France, right)

Leisure: The Forties, lingerie-wise, are epitomized by their glamorous loungewear, like this printed robe by Jay Thorpe, circa 1942

The exhibit opens with a series of relatively modern garments to epitomize this journey. A nylon evening gown by the mid-century designer Claire McCardell is displayed beside a nylon nightgown by the decade’s equally celebrated lingerie label Iris.

In doing so, curator Coleen Hill pinpoints how Ms McCardell was an innovator in her own right, by pulling inspiration from one of the more personal aspects of a woman’s wardrobe. She was among the first designers to take nylon from a lingerie-specific affair and appropriate it for every day, conventional use.

A similar argument is made with two 19th century corsets, shown beside a 2007 Peter Soronen corseted dress who’s boning is exposed with bright topstitching. Even though the garments were created centuries apart, their foundations - so to speak - share a likeminded seed.

Carrying on, the exhibit runs in chronological order – displaying lingerie’s true journey from functional objects with distinctive social purposes to accessories that prioritize fashion and frill.

The 17th and 18th century’s requisite corsets, which not only pushed a woman’s bust to exorbitant heights, but also shrank their waists to similarly small lengths, displays how women were best perceived at the time.

Deeper meaning: Buried within the beauty of this intricate Rococo-era corset (circa 1770) is a socioeconomic message; Due to the artifact's constrictive nature and French court hue, its wearer likely led a life of work-free leisure

Striking shape: The rise of steel in the industrial 19th century led to innovations in fashion as well,  including this underskirt and corset - used to cut the era's infamous S-curve silhouette - which utilize metal instead of whalebone to achieve its structure

As is typical with historical fashion exhibits, FIT’s exploration of lingerie delves into each decade’s high-fashion, premium trends - which until the late 20th century, were dictated by aristocracy.

With this in mind, it is clear that within the corset’s constrictive whalebone gussets lies a deeper, socioeconomic message.

One of the show’s artifacts - a cornflower blue corset that dates back to the 1770s - is an example of this larger discussion.

Not only do its structured lines imply that its wearer would be rendered nearly immobile, but its frilly bow epaulets and royal hue (at least by French court standards) demonstrate that its wearer led a life of work-free leisure. And that is not to mention how the corset’s laced closure - positioned up the back - required at least one servant’s help to tighten, and later loosen, the strings each day.

While the Rococo movement’s corsets displayed a wash of restrained color, by the end of the next century things had turned comparably acid toned – courtesy of the development of artificial dyes.

But by the turn of the 20th century the western world’s then-longstanding tradition for busty appearances and voluptuous waistlines suddenly took a sharp turn towards androgyny.

On view: The 19th century's social standard for house calls meant that even the most leisurely of women needed to look well-dressed, even when relaxing at home; Garments like this French tea gown from 1900 was enlisted in the lives of aristocrats who needed to be ready to accept visitors at the drop of a hat

Sweet dreams: Compared to the 1920s straight flapper silhouette, this nightgown from the Thirties demonstrates how the decade preferred a more shapely figure, while still cutting a slim form

This is most evident in the exhibit’s showing of lingerie from the Twenties, which provides little in the way of support, lift, or shaping.

A delicate bandeau bra from the decade is more of an aesthetic experiment in ribbon and lace than it is an aid in supporting one’s assets: emphasizing how the ideal flapper body’s straight lines took a larger hold on consumer culture at the time.

Women of more diverse proportions were better accommodated the following decade with the Thirties’ penchant for all-in-one girdles that provided a support to the bust, a lightly corseted nip to the waist, and a delicate slip for coverage underneath the era’s filmy, feminine dresses.

The return to a curvier form became even more exaggerated in the Forties, where strong shoulders and a tiny waist were widely favored. But where the decade stood out most, lingerie-wise, was in its approach to chamber dressing.

Diaphanous nightgowns and robes were popularized through golden-age films, where Hollywood femme fatales like Ava Gardner and Vivien Leigh could be seen wearing at-home attire that could have hold its own at a debutante soiree.

Au natural: By the 1970s, the advent of synthetic fibers and a new natural look helped pave the way for underpinnings like this 1977 set by Shelly; Its wireless, padding-free design allowed for a woman's natural breast shape to remain intact while wearing

This 
preference for unabashed femininity was taken to a new level in the 
Fifties, where the advent of crinolines, as well as conical bras, was 
instrumental in creating an iconic look.

Without
 these two underpinnings, the decade’s pluming skirts and pert sweater 
sets would not have received their necessary lift – leaving what is now 
known as the Betty Draper look without its precarious oomph.

But like most things in fashion, for those who inhabited the era, this look soon became stale and tired – making room for the refined and somewhat radical freedoms of the Sixties and Seventies.

The era’s au natural movement heralded unlined, unwired bras. Those who wished to retain a modicum of conservatism found a bit of comfort in relatively miniscule slips.

Loungewear, or pajama-dressing as it is known today, was widely welcomed in the Seventies, when at-home entertaining was a weekly social standby.

Again turning a leaf, the Eighties, as FIT’s exhibit points out, was home to high-octane cuts, bust lines, and sumptuous fabrics that reflect the decade’s more-is-more sensibility.

Modern fare: This Jean Yu set from 2005 is just one of the many choices available to the modern lingerie consumers, who now has more choices than ever before when shopping for underpinnings

Modern lingerie - as is highlighted through artifacts by designers including Jean Yu, Chantal Thomass, and Hanky Panky - is defined by its ability to strike a balance between function, form, fashion, and novelty.

As is the case with many commercial items today, consumers have access to the widest array of products perhaps in history – rendering the trajectory of lingerie as one that is dictated by its wearers, rather than industry.

FIT’s Exposed: A History of Lingerie, is on view in the museum’s Textile History Gallery through November 15.
