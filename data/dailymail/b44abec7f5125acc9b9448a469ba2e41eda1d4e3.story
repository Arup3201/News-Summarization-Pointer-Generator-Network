Only one in six mothers makes a meal from scratch every day, as they lack confidence and the time to cook.

And food campaigners say grandparents are partly to blame - for not passing on their cooking skills to their children.

Instead, youngsters are being served convenience food such as chicken nuggets, sausages and pizza, according to research by the Department of Health.

Mothers said they served up convenience foods such as pizza and chicken nuggets because they were quick to cook and popular with their children

The study found that 16 per cent of mothers cooked a meal from scratch every day.

More than half of the mothers surveyed said they cooking using basic ingredients four times a week or less.

A lack of time was the reason given for serving up convenience foods by 71 per cent of mothers questioned for the Change4Life Be Food Smart campaign.

Only 90 out of the 2,000 mothers surveyed said they never used convenience foods in their meals while a quarter of mothers said they didn't know how to cook or were short of meal ideas and confidence.

Over a third of families (36 per cent) order a takeaway or go out for a meal once a week.

Child nutrition expert and author Annabel Karmel told the Daily Telegraph that pre-chopped vegetables, pre-cooked noodles and boil-in-the-bag rice could all be used as handy shortcuts for time-poor parents.

She said: 'You can prepare a good meal in 15 minutes. Rather than chicken nuggets you can have marinated chicken under the grill.'

Karmel said: 'Cooking from scratch takes a little confidence but a lot don't know how to cook.

'Their parents didn't cook, while cooking in schools was scrapped.'

She told the paper that parents 'gave up' when their children were fussy about food.

Azmina Govindji, of the British Dietetic Association, said: 'It’s understandable that over time eating habits change and that the time-pushed mums of today aren’t necessarily going to approach cooking family dinners in the way their own mothers once did.

'However, many takeaways and processed foods can contain high levels of salt, sugar and saturated fat, so shoppers need to be encouraged to buy healthier options and shown how, even with demands on their time, they can make meals for their families. 'Making quick meals yourself using easy-to-hand ingredients helps you to be more aware of what’s going into your food and helps ensure you and your family avoid any hidden nasties.'
