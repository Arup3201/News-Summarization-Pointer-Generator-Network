Two pilots walked away red-faced but unharmed after the co-pilot forgot to lower the landing gear on approach and the plane made a belly landing at an airport in Taiwan.

It happened while the Daily Air pilots were simulating an emergency landing at the airport in Taitung City on Sunday.

The failure to deploy the landing gear was not part of the training session, and the Taiwanese airline says the forgetful co-pilot may have been too focused on the simulated emergency.

The embarrassing mistake occurred while the pilots were simulating a left engine failure and practicing take-offs and landings in the Dornier Do 228 aircraft, the China Post reported.

When it landed on its belly the plane skidded nearly 700ft before coming to a stop.

The airport was shut for two hours while a crane was brought in to lift the damaged plane off the runway and place it on a flatbed lorry.

A farmer who lives nearby told the China Post he heard a loud rumbling sound at the airport and when he arrived he saw a plane lying flat on the runway and the two pilots climbing out of the aircraft.

The plane is capable of holding nearly 20 passengers, but no one else was on board.

Taiwan’s Aviation Safety Council sent a team to Taitung Airport to investigate the belly landing and assess the damage to the aircraft and runway.

The Taipei-based airline operates flights between the mainland and Taiwanese islands.
