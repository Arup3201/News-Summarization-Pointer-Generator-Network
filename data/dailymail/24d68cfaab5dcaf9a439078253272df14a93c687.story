Amanda Holden has revealed how Jimmy Savile made lewd comments suggesting he wanted to 'give her one' when she was a teenager being treated in hospital.

The TV personality, 42, was just 19 when she met Savile at Leeds General Infirmary while she was being treated for a cut finger.

She told how the shamed Top Of The Pops presenter made a string of 'lame' jokes before offering to give her a gynaecological problem.

In her autobiography she reveals: 'I was 19 when I accidentally sliced through the top of my finger. There was blood everywhere but I didn’t really feel the pain.

'GB’s brother (GB was my boyfriend at the time) was a doctor at Leeds General Infirmary, so he whisked me into hospital, stitched up the wound and went to get me some painkillers.

'All of a sudden, the curtain to my cubicle drew back and Jimmy Savile was standing in front of me!

'At that point, he was still regarded as
a legendary fundraiser and philanthropist. He looked at my bandaged 
hand and made a lame joke about me attempting suicide. I was completely 
taken aback. Then he asked me, "Have you got any gynaecological 
problems?"

"No," I said, thinking it was a bit bizarre. He gave me a weird smile. "Then I can give you one!".'

Holden told how she later gossiped with friends about the incident - but admits she'd already heard other rumours about Savile.

She
added: 'Knowing what we know now, it was a seedy thing to say to me, 
but I dined out on that "Jimmy Savile is a perv" story for years. The 
rumour even when I was 19 was that he’d slept with a 14-year-old.

'Why no one did anything about it, I have no idea.'

Holden has also revealed in her new book how she was sexually assaulted by a famous comedian while married to Les Dennis.

The Britain’s Got Talent judge claims she was cornered by the unnamed celebrity in a corridor at a public event.

But she says she kept the attack secret from her then-husband for fear that he would make a scene.

The attack took place more than a decade
ago while the actress was trying to reconcile with Dennis after her 
affair with Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey before the couple 
eventually split.

'Bizarre': Holden has often told her friends about her strange meeting with Savile

Holden writes in her autobiography: ‘During our first tentative weeks at trying again, we went to an event together and on my way back from the loo I was cornered by a famous comedian, who tried to kiss me and put his hands in places they shouldn’t have been.

'I was scared and tried to push him away, making light of it so he would leave without causing a fuss, but he wasn’t put off.

‘As I tried to fight him off, I caught sight of our reflection in a mirror. My body went limp, and I just stood there as he groped and nuzzled me, observing myself from afar.’

Holden, who is now married to music producer Chris Hughes, said the attack left her feeling ‘cheap and utterly worthless’.

Her latest revelations come as police
continue to investigate allegations surrounding Savile's 60-year reign 
of abuse until he died aged 84 in 2011.

A
report by senior CPS lawyer Alison Levitt, QC, revealed Savile raped 34
women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as
young as eight.

The 
findings have led to questions over the police investigation into Savile
after several young girls came forward claiming they'd been abused by 
the broadcaster.

Former West Yorkshire Police Inspector Mick Starkey, 61, is now being investigated over claims he contacted Surrey Police before they interviewed Savile in 2009 and 'acted on behalf' of the DJ.

Meanwhile, it has emerged BBC chiefs face Lord Hall and Lord Patten will be grilled by MPs this week over an alleged ‘cover-up’ in the £3million inquiry into the Corporation’s failure to expose the Jimmy Savile scandal.

It is expected the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will call up Lord Hall, the BBC’s director-general since April, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, on Tuesday.

They will be asked about their refusal to investigate why key evidence was excluded from the Pollard Review – the report into Newsnight’s axed expose of the disgraced DJ.

Rumours: Holden, who is a judge on Britain's Got Talent with Alesha Dixon, Simon Cowell and David Walliams, revealed she'd already heard rumours about Savile before her chance encounter with him at the hospital
