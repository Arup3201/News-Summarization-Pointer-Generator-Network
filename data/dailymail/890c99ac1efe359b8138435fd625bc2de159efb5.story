Arsene Wenger predicts an exciting new year when Arsenal’s injured stars return to full fitness.

Mesut Ozil is expected back in January and Theo Walcott is almost ready to start after nearly 12 months out with a knee injury.

Mikel Arteta has suffered a slight setback with an ankle problem as he recovered from a calf strain but Arsenal boss Wenger is optimistic about the near future.

'To give everything in every game until end of the season,' said Wenger, when asked what he wanted from the festive games; his side host Queens Park Rangers on Boxing Day before travelling to West Ham. They then face Southampton on New Year's Day at the Emirates Stadium. 

'I believe with injuries back we will have much stronger squad and 2015 can be very exciting if we get injured players back and have a good run. 

'To finish in the top four is always the minimum required but we have Champions League, FA Cup and the Premier League where we want to come back to a stronger position and I think we will.'

Arsenal are sixth in table, 15 points adrift of Chelsea, after they drew 2-2 at Liverpool on Sunday.

The Gunners looked set to take all three points from Anfield but were held when Martin Skrtel equalised in the seventh minute of injury-time. 

Theo Walcott, in training for Arsenal last week, hasn't started a game for the Gunners in almost 12 months 

Mikel Arteta's season has been plagued by injuries. He is currently sidelined with an ankle issue 

'The mood after Liverpool was one of disappointment because we conceded a goal in the last minute,' said Wenger.

'You can concede on corners at any minute. We were not quickly enough organised but the results was a fair result and not a disaster.'

Vice-captain Per Mertesacker came under intense scrutiny after he appeared to dodge Skrtel's winning header in front of the Kop. 

I don’t want to do into individual assessment,' said Wenger when asked about the German World Cup winner.

'Mertesacker gives his best and on the corner but it is more organisational and collective problem because nobody really talks. We work on it. Usually we’re not bad on set-pieces, one of the best records in the league.'

Ozil and Arteta are on target for January comebacks from knee and calf injuries and although Ramsey and Koscielny may miss the Boxing Day showdown with hamstring and calf problems, they could both be in action against Southampton on New Year's Day.

'Ozil will be back at the beginning of January. His rehab has gone well but it took time. He works very hard. He is very focused. Fitness-wise, he is there,' Wenger added.

'Arteta is progressing well. He had a little setback with an ankle problem but it should be very quick now. He will not play before January.

'Ramsey has a chance to be fit for Southampton. The closest at the moment is Koscielny. I believe he's a bit short for QPR, maybe has a chance for West Ham on Sunday.'
