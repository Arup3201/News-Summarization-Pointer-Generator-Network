A tombola that survived the Brighton Grand Hotel bombing  is the star of the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow tonight after being  valued at £5,000.

The historic drum box still  contains raffle tickets signed by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Geoffrey Howe, Norman Tebbitt and, it is believed, two of the people who died in  the explosion in 1984.

The tombola was organised during the Conservative Party conference and Cabinet Ministers bought tickets, signed them and popped them into the revolving drum.

Blast: The Brighton Grand Hotel after the attack

But the tickets were never drawn for in the early hours of the following morning – October 12   – an IRA bomb rocked the hotel, killing five people and injuring another 30.

It is described by the show’s presenter Fiona Bruce as ‘being associated with probably the most daring attempt on the British  Government since the Gunpowder Plot and given that it is connected with such an important moment in our history, where democracy was nearly wiped out overnight, our experts believe it could be as valuable as £5,000’.

The tombola was taken to the Roadshow in Eastbourne by Bob Guy, who bought it at a charity auction shortly after the bombing.

‘I was an apprentice chef at the Grand when I was 15 in 1962,’ said Mr Guy.

‘I remember that same tombola being used in the ballroom then. So when I had the chance, I bid £200 for it. The money went to a local hospital charity. It then spent decades in my loft.’

Mr Guy, 66, recently sifted through the tombola’s 5,000 tickets – ‘many people bought up to 20 tickets each’, he says – to identify the VIP signatures.

Poignantly, it is possible that two might be those of murdered delegates. One is signed ‘M Maclean’ and another simply ‘Taylor’. The dead included Lady Muriel Maclean and Eric Taylor, the Party’s North-West area chairman.
