Two toddlers have died after they were each found floating face-down in a pool at a relative's Florida home earlier this week.  

The Polk County Sheriff's Office has identified the two toddlers - who were cousins - as 18-month-old Silas Lugo-Walsh and 2-year-old Jayvien Watkins.

Lugo -Walsh was pronounced dead at St Joseph's Hospital about 11 p.m. Saturday. Watkins died about 12:30 p.m. Saturday.

The two boys were visiting their grandparents in Lakeland - about 40 miles east of Tampa - when they were found by relatives floating in the pool about 6:30 p.m. Friday.

The boys' frantic parents found the toddlers and called 9-1-1.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said it appears as though the adults in the house had lost track of the boys - the father of one of the boy's was in the house watching a movie upstairs as one of their mothers was downstairs.

Judd told reporters that the father who was upstairs thought the boys were downstairs, while the mother thought they were upstairs.

Judd told the Tampa Tribune that it appears that the boys opened a back door to the house that closes but doesn't latch. Once outside, the boys went through an open gate to gain access to the pool. 

The boys' parents frantically raced around the house looking for the children for several minutes before they found them floating in the pool.

Tragic: Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says the boys' deaths appear to be a tragic accident

Judd tells the paper the investigation is still in its early stages, but 'it appears to be nothing more than a tragic, tragic accident.'

Autopsies on the boys will be performed later this week.
