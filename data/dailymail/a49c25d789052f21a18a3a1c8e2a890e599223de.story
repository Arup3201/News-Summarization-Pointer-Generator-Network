A 17 year-old girl is in hospital after reportedly jumping off the second storey of a Northern Territory detention centre.

The girl, an asylum seeker from Iran, is supposedly being treated for a broken pelvis at the Royal Darwin Hospital after jumping from Wickham Point Detention Centre on Sunday.

Darwin Asylum Seeker Support and Advocacy Network spokesman Peter Robson confirmed self-harm would be 'a plausible explanation' when asked about the fall.

He has called on Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison to 'rethink his policy on sending people to Nauru because it leads to incidents like this.'

But Kerri Griffiths, spokeswoman for Mr Morrison said it was government policy to 'not confirm or comment on reports of individual acts of self-harm.

'All people in immigration detention receive on-site health care as clinically indicated by qualified medical practitioners, including, general practitioners, nurses, psychologists, counsellors and visiting specialists.

'These services are provided or co-ordinated by the contracted health services provider, IHMS.

'If clinically indicated, a detainee will be accommodated in a medical facility, such as a hospital, for appropriate assessment and care,' Ms Griffiths said.
