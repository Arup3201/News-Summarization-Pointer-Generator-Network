Saido Berahino insists he is ready to make the step up for England should the call come from Roy Hodgson.

With eight goals so far this season, the 21-year-old West Brom striker is the highest English scorer in the Barclays Premier League and has been tipped for a senior Three Lions call-up following his stunning form.

England host Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and then go to Scotland for a friendly later this month and Berahino would welcome the opportunity should manager Hodgson select him.

Saido Berahino believes he is ready to play for England's senior side after impressing for the Under 21s

'I am enjoying my football,' he said.

'I am going out there training and if the call does come then it is great for everybody at the club, if it doesn't then I still have to work hard and carry on and push myself to get in the squad. It would mean the world to me. England the UK as a whole has given me a second chance in life.

'I have come here, I have had a better life, I am helping my family out and we are living a good life so it is great. It would be great for me to repay them in that way.'

Berahino drew a blank in the Baggies' 1-0 win at Leicester on Saturday and received an apparent elbow from the Foxes' Marcin Wasilewski and believes he is a marked man.

'I love the challenge,' he told the Wolverhampton Express & Star.

'I think they made a change on Saturday and put two big guys in to make it difficult for me.' 

Berahino has scored eight goals in 13 games for West Brom since the beginning of the season
