Critical: Sir Mervyn King criticised the New York state agency for its comments

The governor of the Bank of England has today criticised a New York state agency for publicly accusing UK bank Standard Chartered of money laundering for Iran and terror groups.

Sir Mervyn King said the New York State Department of Financial Services was wrong to make the claims when other regulators were still investigating any wrong-doing.

Standard Chartered was accused on Monday of laundering £160billion and promptly saw its share price plummet.

By the end of trading on Tuesday, £6billion had been wiped from the bank's stock price.

Standard insist any violations would total a maximum of £9million.

At a news conference, Sir Mervyn contrasted the Standard Chartered case with the way in which U.S. and British agencies dealt with their investigation of Barclays' manipulation of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).

He said: 'In the LIBOR one, all the regulators involved, whether it be in the United States or in England, produced coordinated publication of reports which came out after the investigation was completed and they had made their judgments.

'That's very different from what's happened in the Standard Chartered case where one regulator, but not the others, has gone public while the investigation is still going on.'

But he insisted U.S. authorities were not singling out British banks for attention, adding: 'Clearly, if there has been wrongdoing, then action should certainly be taken.'

Standard Chartered said yesterday it was continuing to cooperate with the Department of Financial Services and four other U.S. authorities: the Department of Justice, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Federal Reserve Group of New York and the District Attorney of New York.

The bank said it voluntarily approached the agencies in January 2010 'and informed them that we had initiated a review of historical U.S. dollar transactions and their compliance with U.S. sanctions' primarily between 2001 and 2007.

Standard Chartered shares were up 7.3 percent to 1,318 pence in midday trading, rebounding from a 16.7 percent drop on Tuesday.

But the bank was mired in more controversy today, however, when it emerged Britain's top financial regulator worked as an ethics watchdog for them during the period of alleged irregularities.

Lord Turner was on the bank’s payroll during the period it is accused of hiding £160billion of transfers used to fund terror groups and Iran’s weapons programmes.

The chairman of the Financial Services Authority worked part time at the UK bank as a non-executive director from August 2006 to September 2008, receiving an annual pay package of £188,000.

One of his key roles was sitting on 
Standard Chartered’s audit and risk committee, which was supposed to 
police bad behaviour and ensure rules were followed.

The committee was also in charge of the company’s ‘speaking up’ policy where staff could raise concerns in confidence.

Although there is no suggestion of wrong doing by Lord Turner, the close ties with Standard Chartered are acutely embarrassing for the peer who has been touted as a leading contender to replace Sir Mervyn as governor of the Bank of England.

The
news comes amid calls for a full Parliamentary inquiry into money 
laundering, prompted by the revelation that HSBC is to be fined up to 
£600million for handling billions of pounds from Mexican drug lords and 
rogue states.

A number of candidates for the governor's role have suffered damage to their reputations.

The
Bank’s deputy governor Paul Tucker has been accused of instructing 
Barclays to rig crucial interest rates used to set mortgages.

This culminated in a £290million fine for Barclays, with at least 15 other financial institutions including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds under investigation.

Lord Green, a former boss of HSBC and another tip for the job, has been fending off calls to resign as trade minister after the bank was accused of money laundering.

And
Peter Sands, Standard Chartered’s chief executive, had also been tipped
as an outside bet for the top job at Threadneedle Street.

He is now fighting to salvage the bank’s battered reputation and reassure panicked investors.

Standard Chartered was accused on Monday of being a ‘rogue 
institution’ and conspiring with Tehran for much of the past decade to 
breach US sanctions.

The New York Department of Financial Services accused the bank of handling 60,000 secret  transfers amounting to at least £160billion from Iranian clients through its New York office.

These included state-owned banks suspected of funding the regime’s nuclear weapons programme and  groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

To conceal these transactions from the authorities, the bank is accused of routinely ‘stripping’ out information that would have revealed the identity of the Iranian clients.

This is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2010.

According to the regulator’s report Lord Turner’s committee was informed of the suspect behaviour in 2006.

Sources close to the peer point out that he had limited powers to stop payments and would have relied on information within the bank.

John Mann MP, a member of the  Treasury Select Committee, yesterday called for a UK Parliamentary inquiry into money laundering.

But he also accused US regulators of an anti-British bias. Standard Chartered yesterday hit back at the allegations from US regulators and claimed that just £9million in transactions breached US sanctions.

A spokesman said: ‘The group strongly rejects the position or the portrayal of facts as set out in the order issued by the DFS.’
