Inflation joy: George Osborne, pictured today in Downing Street, was boosted by the news that inflation has fallen to a 15-month low on the eve of his budget

George Osborne was given a pre-Budget boost today as inflation fell to a 15-month low of 3.4 per cent.

Lower utility bills and discounts from struggling retailers have contributed to the fall in the consumer prices index (CPI).

Inflation dipped to 3.4 per cent last month down from 3.6 per cent in January, 
the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said as energy companies E.ON and Scottish 
Power cut their prices.

The last time the CPI was lower was in November 2010 when it stood at 3.3 per cent.

The retail prices index, which 
includes the cost of mortgages, also fell to 3.7 per cent in February, 
down from 3.9 per cent in January.

The figures were published today ahead 
of George Osborne's budget tomorrow when he is expected to ease the 
burden on family finances by raising the tax threshold to around £9,000.

He is also expected to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p.

Despite
today's positive inflation news for the Chancellor, there are fears 
that soaring oil prices may prevent it from falling later this year as 
sharply as had been predicted.

Lower price rises will be welcomed by households that were squeezed by high prices and sluggish wage growth throughout 2011.

The
decision will also add further weight to the Bank of England's decision
to pump an extra £50billion into its quantitative easing programme last
month.

Bank governor 
Sir Mervyn King and his colleagues have forecast the rate of inflation 
to dip below the Government's 2 per cent target at some point early next
year.

The greatest 
downward pressure on the CPI rate came from domestic electricity and gas
bills, which fell 1.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.

Scottish
Power reduced gas tariffs by an average 5 per cent for around 1.4 
million domestic gas customers last month, after E.ON announced a 6 per 
cent fall in electricity bills, benefiting 3.7 million customers.

Falling: The Consumer Prices Index, the Government's preferred measure of inflation, fell to 3.4% last month, figures revealed today. It is the first time it has been so low since November 2010 Last October, prices were increasing at above 5%

Change: The rising cost of alcohol and tobacco added 0.08% to the cost of a typical basket of goods last month. However, inflation was kept down by a large fall in the price of utilities

But
there was also a drop in the cost of recreation and culture, driven by 
cheaper digital cameras, pet-related products and books, newspapers and 
stationery.

Air fares fell by 1.6 per cent, compared to a 2.1 per cent rise a year ago, driven by cheaper European tickets, the ONS said.

The
average price of petrol rose in February by 1.9p a litre to 135.1p, 
while diesel rose 1.4p to hit a record high of 143p a litre. But the ONS
said this had a negligible effect on the overall rate of inflation.

The price of crude oil has risen by 25 per cent to $125 per barrel since the start of the year as tensions in Iran and Syria escalate.

Barack Obama and David Cameron discussed releasing more oil reserves onto the market to stop further price rises.

Elsewhere, alcohol prices rose 2.6 per cent which is a record rise for a January-to-February period.

Boost: George Osborne, pictured during a visit to Barclays Bank yesterday, was delivered a pre-budget boost as inflation fell to 3.4 per cent

Vicky
Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said food prices, 
which were steady in February, could rise in months ahead in response to
the recently-declared droughts.

She
said: 'The downward trend in the headline rate is likely to pause over 
the next couple of months. Indeed, inflation could even rise in March on
the back of the continued rise in petrol prices.'

Matthew Cheung, chief economist at the market analysts RANsquawk, said: 'The fall was less than expected, but from the Bank of England's perspective, so far so good.

'But there's every indication the CPI rate will float down, rather than tumble.

'Behind
the falling year-on-year number are some conflicting drivers. While the
prices of many consumer goods have been cut, the oil price crept up 
throughout February.

'Currently at $125 a barrel, oil now poses the primary inflationary risk.

'With
the impact of last year's VAT rise fast disappearing from the 
year-on-year figure, next month's figure will flatter the Bank much 
less.'

Falling inflation has provided a small boost to beleaguered savers who have seen their nest eggs cannibalised over recent years.

With
the Bank of England base rate held at a historic low of 0.5 per cent 
for three years in a row, savers struggled to open accounts that keep up
with the rate of inflation.

Today a basic rate taxpayer needs an account that pays 4.25 per cent interest just to keep up with the rate of inflation.

A higher rate 40 per cent taxpayer must achieve a rate of 5.66 per cent.

In order to achieve that, savers will need to use tax-free ISAs or lock up their money over the long term.

A survey today revealed 87 per cent of people are concerned about the effect of inflation on their income.

A
third of people (33 per cent) believe inflation will rise over the next
three years, according to Post Office Savings. Just 15 per cent believe
it will go down.

Over half of people - 53 per cent - do not know what the current rate of inflation is.

Richard
Norman, director of savings and investments at Post Office, said: 
'Today’s inflation announcement will serve as a welcome relief for UK 
savers.'

'With RPI at 3.7 
per cent today, is still higher than the 10 year average of 3.1 per cent
and five year average of 3.5 per cent.'

Improvement: £10.7bn was lent in February - up 14 per cent on the same period last year

Mortgage lending is up 14 per cent in the last year as first-time buyers rush to purchase properties before the stamp duty amnesty ends this weekend.

Banks provided £10.7billion in February and mortgage lending has now been higher year-on-year for the last seven months in a row, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said today.

From Saturday, the two-year stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers purchasing homes worth between £125,000 and £250,000 comes to an end.

The looming deadline has prompted a 
recent surge of interest from this sector of the market, according to 
lenders and estate agents, who have called for the holiday to be 
extended.

The latest lending figure is 'almost identical' to the January, when £10.65 billion was lent.

CML chief economist Bob Pannell said: 'Although a seasonal decline is expected over the winter months, our forward estimates suggest that February was the seventh month in a row of higher year-on-year lending.

'This indicates that lending for house purchase remains brisk in advance of the ending of the stamp duty concession.'

Mr Pannell said the pick-up in activity also appears to mark 'a more generalised improvement' across the market, perhaps reflecting hopes that the squeeze on household incomes caused by high bills and tough employment conditions is easing off.

He said: 'This may reflect household sentiment stabilising in anticipation of a recovery in real incomes, but wider economic uncertainties make it difficult to judge how well the upturn will persist.'

He said a scheme recently launched by the Government to help buyers purchase a new-build property had the potential to offset the expected dip caused by the ending of the stamp duty concession.

The NewBuy scheme enables first-time buyers and home-movers to purchase a new-build home with a deposit of only 5 per cent or 10 per cent, rather than the 20 per cent often demanded by lenders, although this will do little to help those trying to buy or sell an existing property.

Mr Pannell said: 'The launch of the NewBuy scheme is an important addition to lenders' toolkit in addressing the various needs of would-be borrowers.

'The scheme has the potential to offset the dip in first-time buyer activity that the end of the stamp duty concession on March 24 may produce.'
