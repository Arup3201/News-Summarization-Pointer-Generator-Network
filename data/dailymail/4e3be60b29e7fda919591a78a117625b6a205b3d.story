A pair of drunken teenage girls stabbed a man to death with a kitchen knife outside his home over a row which had nothing to do with him.

Christopher Chapman, 24, died from a single stab wound through his liver and stomach after being knifed by Natasha Jade Johnson outside his flat in Blyth, Northumberland.

Johnson and her accomplice Megan Hope were both drunk on vodka, wine and whisky when they started abusing Chapman outside his ground floor home in April.

As well as being intoxicated, Johnson had broken a night curfew imposed on her just three days earlier when she knifed Chapman outside his home.

The teenage pair had become involved in late night row with a group of Chapman's friends and had threatened to 'come and smash their faces in' shortly before the horrific stabbing.

And when Chapman himself went outside to confront the two girls after telling them to 'go away', Johnson, 17, plunged the 15cm blade into his chest.

Chapman collapsed by a nearby tree close to Hope, 19, who had also armed herself with a kitchen knife.

Johnson, of Blyth, Northumberland, and Hope, of Ashington, Northumberland, are now facing life behind bars after Johnson, then 16, brutally killed Chapman in the early hours of April 19.

The pair were today jailed indefinitely after being convicted of murder by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court.

Hope, who went to the scene with Johnson, was also convicted of murder at Newcastle Crown Court, although she did not deliver the fatal blow herself.

Johnson, who can now be named after reporting restrictions were lifted, and Hope wept in the dock as the jury foreman relayed the guilty verdict for murder to both teenagers.

Friends and family of the 24-year-old Mr Chapman hugged each other with joy on hearing the verdict.

Tonya Rutherford, 24, Mr Chapman's partner of two years, said: 'I loved everything about him, he was such a kind and genuine lad.

'He had a lot of friends and everyone had a lot of time for him.

'I am pleased that they got done for murder but nothing is ever going to be good enough.

'The pathetic two excuses for life will never make up for Chappy's one life. I had been with him for two years but I had known him a lot longer.'

The teenage pair were jailed indefinitely today, as it emerged that Johnson should have been at home under curfew when she fatally stabbed Chapman in the early hours of April 19.

Johnson, who was 16 at the time of the killing, had been given a nighttime curfew by a youth court just three days earlier.

Hope, who was 18 at the time, was under a supervision order, but also armed herself with a kitchen knife and was convicted of murder for 'encouraging' Johnson.

Jailing Johnson for a minimum 15 years and Hope for 13 years, Judge James Goss told the pair: The circumstances of the violent and needless loss of Christopher Chapman's young life provide a stark example of the consequences of young, drunken people, out of control, arming themselves with knives and going out intent on fighting.

Addressing Johnson, he added: 'Fighting at night with a knife in public places when intoxicacted naturally causes and in this case caused considerable public disquiet.

Johnson had claimed during the murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court that Chapman 'ran into the knife'

'At the scene you clearly took the leading and most aggressive role and ignored repeated requests to go away.

'You did not intend to kill, however, carrying and using a knife in a violent confrontation always carries the inherent risk of fatal injury being caused, as happened here.'

On the night he was killed, Chapman had invited friends round for a drink and in the early hours, three of them left his flat to go to nearby Asda for more drinks. 

Around the same time Johnson spoke on the phone to one of Chapman's friends, Christopher Armstrong, while he was in the store. 

It is unclear what prompted the call, but the pair were mutually abusive and threatening.

During the call Hope is said to have joined in the abuse while Mr Armstrong's friend joined in on his behalf. 

Johnson threatened to 'come and smash their faces in' and threats and abuse were passing in both directions.

The girls, drunk on whisky, vodka and
wine armed themselves with a kitchen knife each and set off from 
Johnson's home shortly before 3am. 

They
turned up at the victim's home and appeared outside Mr Chapman's 
ground-floor flat and started shouting for those inside to come out. 

Johnson reached through an open window and grabbed a woman who was inside and started calling her names. 

Mr Chapman, who had not been involved
in the earlier row, shouted out of his window for them to go away, 
while another one of his friends went to confront them.

In response Johnson then produced her knife and, as she did so, Mr Chapman came out of the flats, behind the girl. 

She turned to him and stuck the 15cm 
knife in the chest.  Chapman immediately walked to where Hope was 
standing, near a tree, where he collapsed. 

He was taken to hospital by ambulance, but was pronounced dead on arrival. 

Chapman died of a single stab wound which went through his diaphragm and through his liver, stomach and aorta. 

Johnson had claimed the stabbing was an accident and said that Mr Chapman 'ran in to the knife' she was holding.

Both teenagers went back to the younger girl's home afterwards and put their clothes in the washing machine.
