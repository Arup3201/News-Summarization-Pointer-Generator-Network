Liverpool footballer Raheem Sterling has appeared in court to deny assaulting his 20-year-old girlfriend Shana Halliday.

The 18-year-old winger spent Thursday night in a police cell after being arrested at 10.30pm following an incident in Page Moss, Huyton, Liverpool.

Sterling was granted conditional bail and will stand trial at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on September 20 after pleading not guilty to assault at the same court today.

Allegation: Liverpool and England winger Raheem Sterling was arrested on Thursday for assault

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 
‘Raheem Sterling, 18, of Woolton, was charged with Section 39 common 
assault. Sterling was remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool 
Magistrates' Court today.

It is believed the couple had earlier been celebrating her 20th birthday
with a meal out.

The hour before Sterling was arrested he took to Twitter, writing: 'This food is getting dealt with', and posted pictures of a knife and fork, a chicken leg and ice cream.

The Criminal Justice Act 1988 explains the charge, a section 39, could lead to imprisonment should Sterling be found guilty.

Hearing: Sterling was granted conditional bail and will stand trial at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on September 20.

It reads: 'Common assault and battery
shall be summary offences and a person guilty of either of them shall 
be liable to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.'

The alleged victim, who works as a sales assistant at clothing label Hollister, won Miss United Kingdom earlier this year before competing for the world title in March. 

Sterling, who was part of the England Under 21 squad announcement on Thursday, enjoyed a breakthrough for Liverpool in 2012, but tailed off as the season progressed.

The winger, who lives in the leafy 
Liverpool suburb of Woolton, has been dating the beauty pageant finalist
for nearly three years since he joined the club in 2010.
