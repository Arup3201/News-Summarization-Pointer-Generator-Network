The flags of St George are being unfurled, supermarkets are bombarding us with special offers on beer and crisps, and the usual  television  schedules are about to  be obliterated.

In case you hadn’t noticed, the World Cup is about to kick off.

But despite the relentless chatter and endless advertising onslaught, it seems the nation isn’t quite as behind the England team as you might expect.

Uninterested? England fans at a pre-World Cup friendly - but not everyone is in the mood. A survey has found four in 10 English people don't care about the team's chances, and 30 per cent aren't supporting them at all

For a survey claims that four in ten people living in England couldn’t care less what happens to Wayne Rooney and his team-mates when they kick off their campaign on Saturday night.

According to market researchers Mintel, 30 per cent go as far as to say they will not be supporting England, while a further 9 per cent say they do not care either way what happens to Roy Hodgson’s side.

Older people are particularly turned off by the hype, with the over-65s the least likely to care whether the England team make it to the latter stages of the tournament or return home humiliated.

The survey found the North West of England is the most patriotic area with two thirds saying they will be supporting the Three Lions. The North East ranks second and London third.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, support for England tails off even further among those living in Wales and Scotland.

North of the border, some 72 per cent of people have taken an ‘anyone but England’ approach to the tournament, while 5 per cent said they had no strong opinion. And in Wales 60 per cent of those surveyed said they didn’t care what happened to the English.

The research suggests that even those England-based fans who are actively supporting the team may have adopted second teams to follow during the tournament in case England crash out early – with some surprising choices.

Mintel trends expert Richard Cope said: ‘Many bookies have England as only third favourites to emerge from Group D, so there might be an element of England fans hedging their bets in declaring their support for “second teams”.’

He added: ‘In Scotland, 24 per cent are supporting a team other than England, and Scottish supporters have traditionally embraced Germany and Argentina.

‘But we’re also seeing England supporters adopt these former footballing enemies as their second teams – and this is likely to be due to the fact that they have several Premiership stars in their ranks.’

The research suggests one reason for a reluctance to follow England is the poor behaviour of the fans, both at home and abroad.

Families are predicted to splash out £335million in a World Cup spending spree that will include the latest supersize TVs, football shirts and party food and drink.

New TVs will account for half of the spending at £170million, according to Mintel. John Lewis has already seen a 47 per cent rise in TV sales compared with last year.

Figures suggest families will spend an extra £300 each on average as a consequence of the World Cup.

Somewhere behind all those England flags is the home of patriotic football fan Tony Baddams.

The 46-year-old spent weeks covering the entire front of his four-bedroom terraced property (right) with more than 300 flags, shirts and fluffy dice to cheer on the Three Lions.

The decorations even cover his front door and windows – but the Chelsea fan says the lack of sunlight is worth it.

Mr Baddams, from Southampton, said: ‘I just wanted to show my support for the lads.’

His wife Anita, a carer aged 44, hated the display at first but has now grown to love it.

But neighbours still seem far from convinced. One said: ‘I think it is a bit scruffy.’
