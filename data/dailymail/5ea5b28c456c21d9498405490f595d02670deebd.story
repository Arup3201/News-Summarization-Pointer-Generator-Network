Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola has made his music video debut in a song in honour of himself.

The Wonder Villains have released a song entitled simply 'Zola' after a fan published videos of the Italian's classic goals with a one of their previous songs as the soundtrack.

And Zola looks happy and comfortable as he appears in the music video for the pop band, who are from Londonderry in Northern Ireland.

Legend: Zola played for Chelsea and Italy during a distinguished career before going into management

Distinguished: Zola played for Chelsea and also scored 10 goals in 35 internationals for Italy

He plays with a football, blows a whistle and acts as a referee.

The song was actually originally recorded in 2011 but, as Zola agreed to feature in a video if it was re-released, the band have decided to revamp it.

Zola enjoyed a fantastic playing career, scoring 10 times in 35 internationals for Italy.

He played for Napoli, Parma and Cagliari, as well as plying his trade at Stamford Bridge, before managing West Ham and Watford. He is currently without a job after leaving Watford last year.

Explaining why they had written a song about Zola, the band said: 'We released a song on the internet and a fan made an accompanying video for the track which was just made up of classic goals from players like Zola and Dennis Bergkamp.

'We hadn’t thought about Zola in years but we think he’s class so we thought we should write a song about him.

'It really was that simple.'

Coach: After Zola retired from playing he went on to manage West Ham United and Watford

Free: Zola is currently without a job after leaving his position at West Ham last year
