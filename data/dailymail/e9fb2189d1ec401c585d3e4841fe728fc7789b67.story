A six-year-old who suffers from severe cerebral palsy has had her dream of walking again shattered after callous thieves stole her disability car, wheelchair and specially-designed walking frame.

Little Tyla Anguige had been making excellent progress but the heartbreaking burglary has meant the chances of pioneering surgery to help her walk again have been hit.

Raiders drove off in the youngster's disability car which contained the tiny wheelchair and her made-to-measure frame, essential for her physiotherapy, in the early hours of Wednesday.

The inspector leading the case says it is likely the 'heartless' thieves knew exactly what had been taken and has appealed for help to track them down.

Tyla's devastated mother Chrissy Jackson, 25, said: 'She needs the frame for physiotherapy and we can't just replace it because it was a one-off specially made-to-measure walking frame for her.

'Without the physiotherapy an operation to help her walk isn't going to work.

'Tyla has spastic diplegia, which means the muscles in her legs are really stiff. She can't stand up and moves by crawling.

'The wheelchair is invaluable and she uses the frame as part of her exercise regime which she has to do every day to build her strength up.'

Chrissy, who lives with partner Darren Anguige, Tyla and son Jensen, four, in Bradford, West Yorkshire, said Tyla is due to undergo spinal surgery at Leeds General Infirmary next week, aimed at releasing elasticity in her muscles.

She said: 'All children who have had the operation have been walking within a year but the walking frame is crucial for the physiotherapy.'

The raid at the family home was discovered by a neighbour at 5.30am on Wednesday.

The living room had been ransacked with a TV, laptop, iPad and iPods stolen. But the biggest blow was the theft of the family's white BMW 1 series convertible from the drive.

Chrissy said: 'The wheelchair and walking frame were in the boot.

'They are irreplaceable and this couldn't have come at a worse time.

'I'm not bothered about anything else, I just want Tyla's equipment back.

'If anyone knows where they are I would ask them to search their consciences and think of my little girl.'

Det Insp George Bardell, of Bradford South CID, said: 'It is particularly galling that those responsible will have likely known that this was specialised equipment used to assist someone's mobility.

'It is clearly not easy to replace such items which are heavily relied upon by the user for their daily routine.

'These heartless actions will undoubtedly have caused significant upset and difficulties and it is important we apprehend those behind this.'
