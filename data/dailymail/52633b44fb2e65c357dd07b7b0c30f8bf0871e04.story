Allergic: Emma, a talented artist who attended Xaverian College, in Rusholme, Manchester had been warned that a single nut could kill her

A teenage girl died after having a massive allergic reaction to the nuts in a takeaway curry, an inquest heard.

Emma Egerton took only one mouthful of the chicken tikka korma before the reaction set in.

The student, 18, who was alone at the time, had the presence of mind to dial 999 and leave her front door open for the ambulance crews to get in.

But, by the time they arrived she was unconscious and she died in hospital that night.

The inquest heard there was no warning on the menu that the dish she chose may contain nuts.

Yet the korma from the Spice of India restaurant had been cooked in nut oil and contained ground almonds.

South Manchester deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley said she was concerned there was no legal requirement – as there is in restaurants – for takeaways to have clear nut warnings.

She said: ‘We hear an awful lot about food standards and labels – and despite the fact these signs are required in restaurants, they aren’t in takeaways.

'I intend to write to the Food Standards Agency to highlight the issues in this case.’

Emma, whose father John is a chief inspector with Manchester Police, had been warned that a single nut could kill her when she was diagnosed with the hypersensitivity at the age of five.

She was said to be very careful about what she ate and would ask restaurants to cook her meals in separate pans.

Closed: Emma was at home on her own, logged onto the Just Eat website and ordered the dish from the Spice of India takeway in Sale

Tragedy struck in November 2010 when she was at home on her own and logged on to the Just Eat website and ordered the dish from the takeaway.

Police officers later printed a copy of the website menu which showed there were no nut warnings for the korma.

Mohammed Abdul Hannan, owner of Spice of India in Sale, Manchester, said he had repeatedly called the website to ask for nut signs to be put against certain dishes.

Just Eat boss David Butress, said putting warning signs next to dishes was ‘not obligatory’ but the website had reviewed its policy. A verdict of accidental death was recorded.
