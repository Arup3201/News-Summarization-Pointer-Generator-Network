Children in a Japanese city are banned from using their mobile phones after 9pm in a bid to fight cyber bullying.

From April 13,000 schoolchildren, aged between six and 15, living in Kariya city, Aiichi prefecture will not be allowed to use their phones in the evening.

It is hoped the initiative will prevent them from getting sucked into cyberspace crimes, spending long hours exchanging mobile e-mails and suffering other negative effects of mobile phone overuse.

The initiative is the brainchild of teachers, social workers and police, although parents will not face any penalties if their children do not comply, according to Japanese media reports.

Parents are being directly requested to remove 
smartphones after 9pm and monitor the websites they access as part of the campaign across 21 schools, reported The Telegraph.

A spokesperson for the board of education in Kariya was quoted saying the programme is aimed at protecting children from getting into trouble or being bullied via free instant message apps.

A few weeks ago the government released statistics showing the high level use of mobile phones by by Japanese children.

It revealed that schoolchildren aged between 10 and 17 were spending an average of 107.4 minutes a day on-line on their phones.

The idea of limiting the amount children use their phones in Japan was first floated in 2008.

The concern surrounding cyber-bullying is international.

A recent survey found that more than half of children and young people in England accept cyber-bullying as a part of everyday life.

But parents and teachers say they do not feel they are equipped to deal with the growing problem of internet abuse.

Campaigners warned that cyber bullying had become 'an everyday problem for today's children' and demanded better education to tackle the phenomenon.
