A Texas mother returned home Tuesday afternoon to discover her daughter and two sons shot dead in what police are calling an apparent murder-suicide.

The bodies of Rebecca Mughal, 15; Faheed Mughal, 23, and Fahad Mughal, 18, were found scattered around the family's home in the quiet Houston suburb of Stafford at around 2pm.

A fourth sibling, a woman in her 20s, was attending classes at Houston Community College at the time of the killings, according to the Stafford Police Department.

Neighborhood in shock: The murders took place in board daylight inside a red-brick home on the tree-lined Venice Circle in Stafford, Texas

Multiple weapons, including pistols and rifles, have been removed from the crime scene in the 13300 block of Venice Circle. Ballistics experts will have to perform tests to determine which guns were used in the killings, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Police say they received a frantic 911 call at around 2pm from a woman screaming that 'her baby was dead.'

Responding officers discovered three of the mother's four children slain in separate rooms inside the family home. One of the brothers was armed.

On Wednesday afternoon, officials revealed that it was 18-year-old Fahad who used an AR-15 assault rifle to murder his brother and sister at close range before shooting himself in the head.

Neighbors described the Mughals as a quiet family of Pakistani descent who have lived in the red-brick home on Venice Circle for at least two years.

Faheem Mughal, who was known to his friends as Jacob, worked as a mechanic, buying used cars, repairing them in an auto shop located on his parents' property and then reselling them for profit.

His younger brother, Fahad, sometimes helped the 23-year-old fix up vehicles.

Conflicting accounts: Neighbors said they have not heard any arguing coming from the home, but police say they had received calls for service in the past

Next-door neighbor Larry Rangel told the paper he has never heard the Mughal family fight or argue out loud.

However, in a brief phone interview with MailOnlne Wednesday, Lt James Leedom, of the Stafford Police Department, revealed that there had been 'calls for service' at the Mughal residence in the past.

Rebecca Mughal, the youngest of the family, attended Stafford High School.

Former classmate Juan Lopez said the 16-year-old was smart and talked about her aspirations to work in the medical field.

According to Lauren Garza, Rebecca's older brother Fahad dropped out of Stafford High School before graduating.

A Twitter user by the name Fahad Mughal from Stafford, Texas, wrote in January: ‘People cant keep their fingers off a trigger these days.' 

When asked about a possible motive, Lt Leedom replied: 'We may never know.'
