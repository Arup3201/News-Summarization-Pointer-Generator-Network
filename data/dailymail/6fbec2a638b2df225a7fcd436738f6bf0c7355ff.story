Tucked away among the vineyards in the gentle rolling hills of northern Italy is the former family of home of the new Pope's father.

Francis I may have become the first Pontiff from the Americas and the
 first from outside Europe for a 1,000 years, but, like the grave vines, he still has 
strong Italian roots.

The 76-year-old's family hail from Portacomaro Stazione, in the wine producing region of Asti, famous for its sparking Asti Spumante, where his father Mario Jos√© was an Italian railway worker.

The family then relocated - like thousands of other hundreds of thousands of Italian migrants - across the Atlantic to South America.

Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who became Pontiff this week, was born and bred in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he has spent most of his life.

In Italy, however, the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires  still has relatives, including Armando Bergoglio, a cousin of his father, in the village of Portacomaro Stazione.

His family was just one of a great influx of migrants who flocked from Italy to Argentina in two great waves around the end of the 19th century and immediately after the World War II.

Between 1857 and 1930 total immigration was over 
			6,000,000, almost all from Europe. About 55 per cent of these were Italians. Today, more than 60 per cent of Argentina's population comes from Italian stock.

The multilingual Pope's birthplace has been seen as a 
significant move for the Church, taking the Papacy to a continent in 
which 42 per cent of the world's Catholics live.

It
 also poses a diplomatic puzzle for Britain, which went to war with 
Argentina when Bergoglio was rising through the ranks of his national 
church.

While his family hail from Italy, he is first non-European Pope since the Syrian Gregory III in 731.

Known
as an avid reformer, he becomes the third non-Italian Pope in a row, 
having being born and spent his life in the Argentinian capital.
