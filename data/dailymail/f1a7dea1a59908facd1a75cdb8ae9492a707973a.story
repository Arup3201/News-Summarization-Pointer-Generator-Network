With a flick of the switch, a 76-foot Norway Spruce from Connecticut officially became the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree on Wednesday night, after it was illuminated for the first time this holiday season in a ceremony that’s been held since 1933.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg turned on the lights just before 9 p.m., setting off a dazzling 45,000 mulch-colored LED lights and a 9 1/2-foot-wide Swarovski star that topped the 12-ton tree.

Adam Connery, 41, and his wife Kristy Connery, 37, from Tyngsborough, Mass., watched the ceremony on their first vacation to New York City.

Today Show personalities Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie and Natalie Morales co-hosted Christmas in Rockefeller Center, which aired on NBC.

They dedicated the broadcast to James Lovell, 58, a married father of four and a sound and lighting expert who worked on the tree.

Lovell was one of four people killed when a Metro-North commuter train derailed in the Bronx on Sunday.

He was on his way to work on the tree when the accident occurred.
