Forced to sleep downstairs: Ritchie Doyle weighs 42-stone and is now too large to climb up steps in his home

A 42 stone Irish man has been forced to sleep on his floor downstairs after becoming too large to climb his staircase.

Ritchie Doyle, 44, from Bantry, County Cork, is demanding that his local council move him to more suitable accommodation.

He has ulcerated legs and relies on the use of an oxygen ventilator. 

Mr Doyle, who was born in Dublin, says he has been on the waiting list for a home for over a year now.

He claims his condition is deteriorating further every day. 

‘The number of trucks and cars passing by each day has led me to 
hospital, where they diagnosed slight carbon monoxide poisoning. I find 
it harder and harder to breathe as the days go by,’ Mr Doyle told Ireland's Southern Star.

Mr Doyle says he can access his bathroom because it is on the ground floor, but longs to sleep in a bed again.

His case has been backed by Councillor Kathleen Tassyman.

She
told the newspaper: ‘The house here simply isn’t suitable for Ritchie 
and his condition. He has to leave the front door open to let in air and
in this heat it is very important that he can breathe properly.

'With 
the traffic going by, he [Ritchie] is exposed to the fumes from the many
trucks and cars,’ Cllr Tassyman said.

‘He
has been waiting for over a year. Everyone is entitled to a home. 
Indeed, Ritchie doesn’t even have a proper bed.

She told the newspaper that she is calling on on the housing department in Cork 
County Council to visit Mr Doyle and asses his conditions.
