A Titanic enthusiast has built an exact replica of the doomed liner - out of old clockwork and broken VCRs.

Jason King, 40, spent two and a half years meticulously crafting the nine-foot model out of scrap materials, which now sits in his study.

Every minute detail of the vessel has
been replicated - on a 1:100 scale - right down to the rigging and 
number of deck benches.

Ship builder: Jason King with his replica Titanic which took him 25 hours a week over more than two years

Exact replica: The Titanic sits in Jason's study. He has had a number of offers for it, but want his children to 'cherish it'

Ship shell: The hull's shape was formed from scrap wood. Every minute detail of the nine-foot vessel has been replicated - on a 1:100 scale - right down to the rigging and number of deck benches

And spookily, Jason finished the model on the anniversary of the ships sinking - April 15, marking 100 years since it sank.

The father of two - Thomas, 9, and six-year-old Matthew - from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, spent £2,500 a materials for his labour of love.

He said: 'It certainly kept me out of the wife’s [Nicola]  way for a while, so she was quite pleased.

'It’s a part of the furniture now. I want it to become a family heirloom for my kids to cherish.'

Jason, who works for an engineering firm, bought over 150 books on 
the ship so he could  meticulously research every last detail to make sure his 
model was inch perfect.

Big paint job: Jason put the model in his garden when he sprayed the liner. He finished work on it on April 15, the 100th anniversary of the sinking

Meticulous: The funnels, deck houses, fittings, masts and lifeboats were all built from scratch by Jason who researched the project to ensure every detail was correct

Luxury liner: Jason spent £2,500 on materials to build the doomed ship which was on its maiden voyage when it hit an iceberg

But he admitted: 'It was a bit of trial and error. I had built some models before of the Titanic, but nothing as big as this.

'I didn’t want to build a model this size and skimp on anything. So I did a lot of research, looking at old pictures to make sure everything was correct.

'Most people would not even notice the detail, but I wanted to make sure that no one could pick holes in it.'

Jason estimates he spent a staggering 25 hours a week working on the model.

Attention to detail: Jason bought over 150 books on the ship to make sure he included every detail from deck benches to funnels and walkways

Doomed ship: The model includes the lifeboats. There were not enough for all the passengers and crew when Titanic hit the iceberg

Labour of love: Jason spent two-and-a-half years making the model and has turned down offers worth thousands of pounds to buy it

And since completing it he has already received offers in the thousands to snap it up, but rebuffed them all.

Jason, who has previously built a smaller Titanic and a replica of the ship as a wreck, said: 'Once I finished it, the first thought on my mind was to sit back and enjoy it.

'I won’t say never to selling it, but having sold two previously I just want to enjoy this one.

'It took exactly two and a half years to make working pretty much every day. It shows that if you put your mind to something you can achieve it.'

He added: 'The model definitely has the wow factor. People are blown away by the scale and level of detail when they see it.'

At 11.40pm on the night of 14 April 1912, the doomed Titanic stuck and iceberg.

It was on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York when disaster struck - sinking less than 3 hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives, almost two-thirds of the people on board.

The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage. Operated by the White Star Line, she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.

Captained by Edward Smith, her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants seeking a new life in North America.

The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins.

She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, she only had lifeboats for 1,178 people – slightly more than half of the number travelling.

After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York.

On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm.

The glancing collision caused Titanic's hull plates to buckle inwards in a number of locations on her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea.

Over the next two hours and forty minutes, the ship gradually filled with water and foundered around 2:20 AM. Passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially filled.

A disproportionate number of men – over 90 per cent of those in Second Class – were left aboard because of a 'women and children first' protocol followed by the officers loading the lifeboats.

Many of those in the water died within minutes from hypothermia. 

Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.
