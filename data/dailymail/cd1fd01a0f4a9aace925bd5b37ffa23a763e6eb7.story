It is one of life’s little  frustrations: you brace yourself with an umbrella on a stormy day, but the moment you step outside it blows inside out.

Now blustery conditions could become a breeze with the help of a storm-proof umbrella.

Tapered at the back, rather like a cyclist’s racing helmet, it is said to be able to withstand winds of up to 70mph.

Asymmetrical: The unique tapered design is said to direct wind over and around the umbrella, and make the brolly easier to hold in blustery weather

Normal umbrellas are turned inside out by gusts of only 13mph, tests show.

The asymmetrical design is also easier to hold upright, helping its carriers appear unflappable on the stormiest of days.

Tests
 in a wind tunnel found that some women were unable to hold a normal 
umbrella in gale-force winds, but they did not struggle with the Senz 
design.

Meanwhile, the
 arm muscles of both men and women in the wind tunnel did a third less 
work when carrying the storm-proof brolly, according to a Dutch study 
published in the journal Applied Ergonomics.

The Senz umbrella, which is thought 
to be the only type of its kind, was dreamt up by a Dutch industrial 
engineering student, Gerwin Hoogendoorn, after storms broke three of his
 brollies in a week.

After running up the prototype on his
 grandmother’s sewing machine, he formed a company with two university 
friends and now sells the umbrellas globally, with prices starting at 
£20.

The secret to 
their success is said to lie in the aerodynamic design which directs 
wind over and around the umbrellas, holding them in position.
