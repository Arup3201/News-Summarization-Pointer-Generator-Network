A Russian banker went on a gun rampage, shooting dead three of his colleagues then blowing himself up with a grenade, it has been reported.

The man, an official of the Russian Central Bank in the far east city of Blagoveshchensk, mowed down two women and one man at the bank's offices before committing suicide, a spokesman for the region's investigative committee, Alexei Lubinsky, told Interfax news agency.

Russia's LifeNews website reported that the shooter, a man named Vladimir Levkin, was motivated by revenge after his colleagues voted to fire him as part of the bank's policy to lay off some of its staff.

The report said Levkin used a hunting rifle to commit the murders. An eyewitness described how he then took his own life with an explosive device.

A bank employee told Komsomolskaya Pravda: 'We have reorganization [in the bank], we are having our staff reduced. And the guy has a paralyzed child and a non-working wife.

'Where did he take the rifle from? He killed people and then blew himself up with a grenade. This is horrible.'

Police will try to determine how the banker managed to smuggle the gun into the bank (file picture), which was considered to be well-protected

One female victim was a deputy head of department, the other a head of a bank branch, while the male was head of bank management, according to Russia Today.

Russia's Central Bank head office in Moscow confirmed to AFP in an emailed comment that a 'terrible tragedy' had occurred and offered condolences to the families of the slain employees.

'We consider what happened in Blagoveshchensk to have been a terrible tragedy,' first deputy chairman Georgy Luntovsky said in the statement.

'Right now security officials are working at the scene to determine all of the circumstances,' he said.

Police will try to determine how the banker managed to smuggle the gun into the bank, which is considered to be secure.
