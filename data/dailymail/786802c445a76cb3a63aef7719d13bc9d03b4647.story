A University of Delaware graduate has come forward to tell the story of how a professor offered to give her an 'A' grade in exchange for oral sex. 

The recent graduate, who has remained unidentified, spoke out to NBC Washington and shared the email she received from sociology professor Eric Tranby, reportedly asking 'will you blow me for an a?' 

That professor has since resigned, but the graduate says the university has been uncommunicative about their investigation and she wants more answers.

Grades: Former University of Delaware Professor Eric Tranby (pictured) has been accused of asking a student for sex in exchange for an 'A' grade

The woman first accused Tranby, who was also her advisor, last May. 

'He told me what specific sexual acts he wanted to perform with me,' she said.

She says he even bragged about having sex with other students in his office, after hours.

'He said, "Oh well, you know, we just cover up the webcam and pull the blinds down."' 

The student declined, and that's when Tranby got scared. He sent another email back apologizing for the comment, writing that he knew it was wrong 'as soon as I typed it'. 

He then allegedly begged her not to tell school administrators, saying it would ruin his career and he would give her a top grade anyway. 

While Tranby denied the allegations in two interviews, he eventually went on administrative leave and resigned at the end of the school year. 

Issues: Some 300 students gathered last term after Tranby resigned, demanding more transparency from the school administration

The student in question says her experience reporting the incident to the school has been a nightmare, and that it seemed like officials were trying to cover it up. 

'You realize that they are not doing anything for me,' she said. 'Or if they are I don’t know about it. I don’t know what’s taking place. It needs to stop. Somebody needs to do something and it needs to stop.' 

Tranby's resignation sparked a protest last semester, with about 300 students gathering to demand more transparency from the school. 

A spokesman for the school told NBC that they are not allowed to comment on the specifics of the case, but say the incident was 'handled promptly and properly with sensitivity to the complainant and clear communication with all parties involved.' 

MailOnline's calls to Tranby were not returned Thursday.
