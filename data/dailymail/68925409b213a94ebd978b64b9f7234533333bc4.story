At least four people are dead and 20 injured after snow squalls, high winds and slippery roads led to a 
chain-reaction of crashes on a mile-long stretch of an interstate in 
Detroit on Thursday.

Three children are among the fatalities after poor visibility conditions on Interstate 75 on the southwest side of the city preceded the mass of crashes this morning, said Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw.

The children are believed to have been traveling in the same vehicle together while the adult fatality is said to have been further ahead, according to Shaw.

Those transported to area hospitals for injuries included broken bones, head trauma and lacerations while more than 30 people were treated at the scene for injuries, Detroit EMS Chief Jerald James told the Detroit Free Press.

Fatal: At least four people are dead and 20 injured on a mile-long stretch of southbound I-75 after more than two dozen vehicles, including tractor-trailers, all crashed into one another

Twisted metal: Crumpled vehicles are seen abandoned facing every which way on the interstate after the deadly crash

Comforting: Family members hug at the side of the highway among scattered debris and vehicles

Crumpled: A PT Cruiser sits smashed on the interstate between two tractor trailers

Trapped: A vehicle is seen spun sideways and under a truck while mutually pressed against the concrete guardrail

SUVs with smashed front ends and cars
with doors hanging open sat scattered across the debris-littered 
highway, some crunched against jackknifed tractor-trailers and tankers.

The accident around 9.30am is said to have started on the bridge crossing the Rouge River after snowfall quickly turned to ice, Michigan Department of Transportation spokesman Rob Morosi told the Free Press.

Morosi said salt had been applied to the roadways prior but it appears to have done not enough to help.

Motorists and passengers who were able to a get out of their vehicles huddled together on the side of the road, some visibly distraught, others looking dazed.

A man and woman hugged under the gray, cloud-filled skies, a pair of suitcases next to them and a bumper on the ground behind.

'We're not sure of the cause,' Shaw told The Associated Press. 'Some witnesses said there were white-out conditions.'

More than two dozen vehicles were 
involved in the pileups and scores of cars and trucks not involved in 
crashes were stuck on the freeway behind. Shaw said it could be hours 
before the freeway reopened.

Greg Galuszka was driving a fuel truck along I-75 when white-out conditions quickly materialized.

'I
looked on my driver's side mirror, and I could see the trucks piling up
back there,' Galuszka said, pointing to a mass of twisted metal where 
vehicles had smashed into each other a short time earlier.

'Then, when I looked in my passenger side (mirror), is when I saw the steel hauler coming up,' he said. 'I just said my prayers from there and said, 'Please don't hit me.''

Shaw said many people had to be pulled from their vehicles. Numerous fire engines and ambulances were at the scene.

Tragedy: The front of a tractor trailer is seen ripped off while beside it another car's entire back section is seen smashed into its middle

Pressing forward: State police helped move some of the vehicles to the side of the interstate that was shut down on that one side

The crash happened as a wave of snow and strong blustery winds reduced visibility across southeastern Michigan, said Bryan Tilley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oakland County's White Lake Township.

'There was a pattern of snow showers moving through the area in the midmorning hours,' Tilley said. Nearby Detroit Metropolitan Airport had west winds at 20 miles per hour, with gusts to 33 mph around the time of the crash. The temperature of 24 degrees was about 30 degrees colder than a day before.

The crash happened near an elevated stretch of expressway where the road surface can cool quickly and make driving hazardous, Tilley said.
