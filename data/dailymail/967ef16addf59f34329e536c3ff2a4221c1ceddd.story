An Australian tennis player who  allegedly threatened to post nude photos of his ex-girlfriend online has been charged in the U.S. with aggravated stalking.

Mark Terry Henderson was once part of one of the world's top-60 doubles team and was ranked Australia's top-ranked tennis junior in 1999, before going on to play at two U.S. universities and coach at Northwestern and Western Michigan universities.

For about five years, Henderson, 32, had been in an on-and-off again relationship with a 29-year-old Chicago woman when she ended the relationship in February, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

Despite having returned to Australia to live in Brisbane, for months the former tennis star allegedly harassed his ex-girl friend with emails, texts and phone calls, including threatening her life, prosecutors alleged.

Prosecutors said Henderson even sent a collage made up of naked photos of his former partner to her and threatened to post it on the internet if she refused to send him more naked photos.

But even after police in Australia and Chicago contacted him about the harassment, Henderson continued his behaviour.

Police in Chicago and Australia contacted him, but he allegedly continued the harassment.

Henderson was previously ranked Australia's top junior tennis player and went on to enjoy a career coaching at U.S. universities

On May 6, Henderson left Australia bound for Chicago and was found by police the following day sitting outside his ex-girlfriend's parents house, it has been alleged.

On a nearby street later that day, the Australian man approached the woman and again threatened her life before she ran to her car and locked her self inside, prosecutors said.

Henderson tried opening all of the car's door handles,  but the woman successfully escaped and call police, prosecutors said.

Following the incident, Henderson fled to Tennessee, was arrested and extradited back to Chicago on Thursday.

A judge granted him $US500,000 ($A540,980) bail if he surrendered his passport, stopped using social media and required to be GPS monitored.

Henderson told the judge on Saturday that he wanted the Australian consulate notified of his arrest.

He returns to court on Tuesday, reported the Chicago Tribune.
