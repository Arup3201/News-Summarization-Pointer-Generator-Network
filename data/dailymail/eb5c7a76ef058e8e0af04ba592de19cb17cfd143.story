A huge police search is underway for missing Durham University student Euan Coulthard, 19

Friends and loved ones of missing Durham University student Euan Coulthard have appealed for him to 'come home'. 

More than 100 students joined the police in their search for the second-year law student today.

Mr Coulthard, 19, went missing on Thursday morning after going for a night out in Durham.

The 'model student' had been for an Italian meal on Wednesday evening to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday and went on to the Love Shack nightclub in the city centre, leaving on his own just after midnight.

He has not responded to texts, emails or Facebook messages since leaving the club shortly after midnight, which is out of character, police said.

Friends have appealed for help him finding Mr Coulthard, from Nottingham, using the hashtag #findeuan.

Dan Gibson tweeted today: 'Good luck to everyone up in Durham today searching for one of the nicest, most genuine blokes I have ever met. Come home mate. #FindEuan'

Friend Luke Holdsworth tweeted: 'Such a top bloke, time to come back now mate #findeuan'

Lewis Dann added: '#findeuan - great lad and a very good friend, praying for a positive outcome!'

Police were today continuing their search for the missing teenager, with Teesdale and Weardale Mountain Rescue scouring the river Wear in Durham.

Mr Coulthard is 5ft 9in, of average build with light brown hair, which is short on the sides and longer on the top. 

When he was last seen he was wearing black skinny jeans, a denim jacket and a beige patterned shirt.

Mr Coulthard, 19, went missing on Thursday morning after going for a night out in Durham

Lee Murray, 18, from Durham's St Mary's College, where Mr Coulthard studies, was among the search party yesterday.

The sports student said: 'We have been out since around 8am, there's around 100 of us left but earlier on there was double that.

'We all want to do our best to find Euan, he is a lovely lad who is really involved in the college socials, he loves cricket and everyone speaks about how liked he is.

'It's so tragic. We're handing leaflets out to ask the if the people of Durham have seen Euan and if anyone has any information it would be appreciated.

'We came down to the riverside to see if we could even find his jacket, if he has gone into the water, we couldn't find anything.

'I just hope the police can do a better job. Everyone is devastated, especially his close friends and flat mates.'

The student has not responded to texts, emails or messages since leaving the club shortly after midnight

Professor Simon Hackett, principal of St Mary's College, said: 'We were first told on Thursday afternoon that students were concerned they had not seen Euan and we did not hesitate to contact the police.

'Euan is doing exceptionally well in his degree, he is a model student and is heavily involved in the social aspects at St Mary's.

'He is a keen footballer and has an interest in cricket. He is well-liked and this is completely out of character for him.

'Euan's disappearance has affected the entire community at the university and staff are here to provide support for any student that needs it.

'We would love anyone who has any information to contact the police as it is a very distressing time for all at St Mary's and the university.'

The huge search for the second-year law student continued today, with no sign of where Mr Coulthard may be

Chief Inspector Sue Robinson, of Durham police, told Sky News: 'Because the river has been so high, today, Saturday has actually been the first opportunity we've got to actually search the river as well as the banks.

'Of course as time passes, and we've had tremendously cold weather over the last three days, the welfare of Euan is paramount and our concerns are rising.

'However, this is still an active missing from home inquiry, and we'll continue in that vein until we receive information otherwise.'

She said she had 'every hope' Mr Coulthard would still be found.

Inspector Dave Coxon, of Durham Police, said on Thursday: 'We have serious concerns for Euan's welfare as there has been no trace of him since the early hours of this morning.

'He hasn't responded to any attempts to contact him and his phone has not been traced.'

Anyone with information was asked to call 101.
