Police in the Oregon coastal town of Lincoln City say a nine-year-old girl trapped when a sand hole collapsed on her has died.

Lieutenant Jerry Palmer says police and firefighters responded shortly after 5pm Friday and found a group of people trying to dig out the girl, identified as Isabel Grace Franks.

Palmer says officers helped extract Franks from a large hole.

Police began CPR after Isabel was pulled free, unconscious and not breathing.

North Lincoln Fire and Rescue and ambulance medical teams took over CPR and the girl was taken to a hospital, where she died.

Palmer says family members were with Franks when the collapse occurred. She was not identified pending notification of other relatives.

North Lincoln Fire spokesman Jim Kusz told The Oregonian that the girl and her family were visiting from Sandy, 28 miles southeast of Portland.

Kusz told KOMO News that Isabel was buried for about five minutes.

Witnesses said the girl and some other young children had dug the hole on the beach.

She sat down in the hole just before 5pm and the sand caved in on her.

Tribute: Mourners placed flowers and candles in the hole on the beach as part of a makeshift memorial

'And we heard screaming,' Tracey Dudley who was staying at a nearby hotel, told KOMO News, 'and screaming coming from the beach. At first we thought, you know, it was just kids, but it was like screaming and screaming and screaming.'

She called 911 and watched as people tried to dig the girl out, but sand kept falling straight back into the hole.

'It was heart-wrenching,' Dudley said.

'You could see that people were trying, and I don't even know what to say. It was awful.'

The hole was filled and mourners placed flowers and candles in memorial to Isabel Franks.Â
