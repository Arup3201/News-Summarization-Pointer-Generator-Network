Nigel Farage will appear on a 'rip-roaring' Gogglebox special 

UKIP’s Nigel Farage is to appear in an ‘alcohol-fuelled’ Gogglebox special.

The party’s leader was filmed sitting on the sofa with the TV review show’s posh couple Steph and Dom for a Gogglebox spin-off, Channel 4’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt has revealed.

She told Radio Times that the show would be a ‘rip-roaring alcohol-fuelled watch,’ adding: ‘He gets p***** with them, but they also give him a grilling.’ 

The documentary, entitled At Home With Steph And Dom, will be broadcast next year.

Gogglebox, featuring a regular group of opinionated friends and families discussing the week’s TV shows, has been a surprise hit for the broadcaster.

She said that Channel 4 was now the 'alternative mainstream'. 

Mrs Hunt added: ‘We have found in Gogglebox an array of characters that people have taken into their hearts – they just love them. Gogglebox is my take on the week. We have a show that feels unmissable.’

She said: ‘When Channel 4 launched it was an outsider channel that represented voices that weren’t heard elsewhere.

‘We are still trying to talk to lots of people in the country and reflect Britain back to itself, we do it with a slightly different perspective.’ 

The former controller of BBC1 said that she was a 'conspicuous woman in an industry that is still dominated by men'.

She said of some of the criticism which has been directed against her: 'You have to take it on the chin, but of course it hurts. You become inhuman if you're not affected by people being critical and it should give you pause for thought. It always gives me pause for thought.'

Hunt, who earned £497,000 in 2013, defended her salary, saying: 'We are commercially funded.

'We don't take public money. In the nicest possible way, my salary is set by the board. And I think you need to talk to them about that.'
