The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures.

The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year.

Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people.

Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival

On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show

Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation.

For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug.

It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties.

Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike.

Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low

Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago.

The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint.

It found that some 6.1 per cent of 
adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had 
taken salvia in the last year.

However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began.

The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996.

And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent.

Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events.

Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began.

‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’

A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe.

Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous 
oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and 
industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young 
people is of concern.

'"Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'
