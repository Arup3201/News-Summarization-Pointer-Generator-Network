An unemployed agoraphobic who receives benefits by attending Jobcentre meetings via videolink claims she is the victim of discrimination after being told she must start turning up in person.

Jen Lant risks losing the £98 employment support allowance she gets from the monthly meetings and argues the new rules discriminate against her because of she is disabled.

The 22-year-old, who has a GP's letter explaining her condition, has 'good days' when she can leave her house for a couple of hours but is often unable to set foot outside.

Agoraphobic: Jen Lant is often unable to step foot outside the house because of her condition

She said: 'With my agoraphobia that will be virtually impossible. Even with a letter from my GP they 
have told me I have no way of getting around it so I'm in a situation 
where I really don't know what to do'

Miss Lant has been on the skills training programme since 2011 and has regular appointments with training firm Seetec at the Jobcentre.

She has been logging onto to the 
internet and speaking to trainers and employment support advisers from 
her home in Marks Tey, near Colchester, Essex, for two years.

Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations in which escaping is difficult.

An agoraphobic might be afraid of visiting a shopping centre, travelling on public transport or even leaving home.

Sufferers experience a panic attack, with a rapid heartbeat, hyperventilation and nausea.

Award-winning director Woody Allen has claimed to suffer from agoraphobia.

Beach Boys front man Brian Wilson suffered from the condition in the 1970s, when the band toured without him.

Treatments can range from anti-depressant medications top cognitive therapy.

Miss Lant, who is set targets that focus
on helping her to work and take online courses and is hoping to find a 
job which allows her to work from home, said: 'There are lots of other disabilities in which people cannot leave their homes for various reasons.

'It seems the JobCentre along with Seetec are discriminating against these disabilities and are getting away with it.

'They were not able to tell me over 
the phone how much I might lose but that is money which is needed to go 
towards rent and other things.

'Put yourself in the shoes of someone 
who'd be living alone in a flat, disabled, unable to work, and unable to
go to their Seetec appointments, they'd lose money they need to 
survive.'

A spokesman for the Department for Works and Pensions said: 'Meetings with a Work Programme provider are an important part of the process of helping someone with an illness or disability prepare for eventually moving back into work.

'Any work-related activity a person is expected to do in return for their benefit will be appropriate to their condition.'
