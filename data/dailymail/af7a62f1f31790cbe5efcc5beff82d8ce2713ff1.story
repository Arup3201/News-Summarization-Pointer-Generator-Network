Nikola Zigic has rejoined Birmingham City five months after leaving the club.

The 6ft 8in striker has been granted a work permit and has signed until the end of the season to provide Gary Rowett with another attacking option.

Zigic, whose contract worth £65,000 per week was a burden as Birmingham struggled last season, left in July but remains popular with club staff and is now on vastly reduced terms.

The 34-year-old, originally signed for £6million from Valencia in 2010, will not be available for Saturday’s Championship match at Blackpool, however, as he needs to attain a working visa.

He will fly to his native Serbia on Thursday to have his application processed in Belgrade. This can take up to a week.

It is hoped he will be available for the Championship match against Reading at St Andrew's on December 13. Zigic, part of the 2011 League Cup-winning side, had been training with Birmingham since November and the club are delighted he has re-signed.

Director Panos Pavlakis said: 'We welcome him back home. We know how happy he is to be here again and enthusiastic about making a contribution.'

Rowett had said previously: 'I think he will bring something different to us, that’s what we are looking at - we want different players in the building and not similar players to what we have got.'
