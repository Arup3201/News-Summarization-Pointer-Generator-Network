Brooke Mueller is accused of 'lashing out' of Denise Richards during an emergency meeting over the custody of her twins on Thursday, it has been claimed.

Concerned about Charlie Sheen and Brooke's four-year-old sons Max and Bob, the Los Angeles Department of Children & Family Services are reported to have brought her and the actor's 2nd wife together to discuss the future for the twins.

But Brooke, who isn't
scheduled to regain custody of her boys until December, is said to have found the pressure of the meeting too much, becoming 'extremely combative' and having a 'temper tantrum' directed at Richards, who has been looking after the boys, during the meeting, according to RadarOnline.

A
source revealed to the site: 'Brooke was extremely combative and lashed
out at Denise. It came out of nowhere and was extremely inappropriate. 
It was probably the first time DCFS saw cracks in Brooke’s previously 
cool demeanor.

'Brooke was having a temper tantrum because she felt Denise was making her look like a bad mother.'

Another source had told Radar: 'The 
meeting has been called in hopes of convincing Denise to keep the boys 
for at least another three weeks until Brooke is scheduled to get them 
back.'

However, TMZ reported a different version of events - claiming that Brooke and Denise were 'cordial' with each other and are close to calling a truce.

Whatever
happened inside the meeting, Brooke looked in good spirits and was seen
smiling as she left the face-to-face in a chauffeured 
black Cadillac Escalade on Thursday.

Denise 
was apparently seen arriving and leaving Sheen's home in a car on 
Thursday while Brooke was also spotted driving up to the house, it has 
been claimed.

She wants them with her: The rehabbed ex of Charlie - seen here with her kids in 2011 - wants her twins Bob and Max, aged four, back in her custody

Denise, 
42, has been watching the boys as a favour to her ex-husband Charlie, 48
- who she divorced in 2006 - after Brooke, 36, went into rehab for the 
21st time earlier this year.

But this week the former Bond girl wrote to the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that 
she can no longer look after the boys because of their violent 
outbursts, according to TMZ.

In a letter, the actress detailed how the twins 
tried to strangle her own daughters Sam, nine; Lola, eight; and Eloise, two. She also 
complained the twins relieved themselves in their maid's bathtub and 
also tortured her dogs.

To add even more drama to the pot, on
Wednesday a judge put a restraining order on Charlie, asking him to not
go within 200 yards of his ex-wife Brooke, from whom he split in 2011. He 
replied with a 'thank you'.

This comes after he posted a photo of a cake decorated with a grenade, which he said was made for the troubled socialite.

Brooke was also in court and had
her lawyers try to suspend Sheen's visitation rights to no avail. She 
also wants Denise removed as guardian of the boys but that wasn't accepted.

According to RadarOnline,
Brooke looks set to regain full custody of the boys by Christmas, after
impressing the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family 
Services with her commitment to getting sober and turning her life 
around.

A source told the 
website: 'Brooke will be awarded custody of the boys by Christmas, as 
long as she doesn’t relapse. She has been sober for several months. She 
hasn’t had one dirty test.

'She
has done everything that has been asked of her by DCFS, so at this 
point, there is absolutely no reason for Brooke not to get her boys 
back.'

The suggestion that 
Brooke could regain custody comes just days after photographs emerged of
her son Bob with severe bruising to his head.

The shocking images show injuries on Bob's face, which it has been alleged in a document submitted to an LA court were sustained while the boy was in the care of his mother Brooke or his grandmother Moira Fiore.

In one zoomed-in image,
reportedly taken by Denise, Bob returned from a weekend with Mueller and 
Fiore on July 26, with a noticeable raw skin sore near the red 
mark.

The images have now been presented to the LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team.

Sources told 
TMZ Charlie believed it was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it 
before he arrived at her home. An enraged Charlie said: 'These crimes against my children will be exposed. These
war criminals will be hanged at dusk to a cheering and jeering crowd, 
gathered together in love in support of all children who are mercilessly
discarded like garbage by CPS. Which by the way stands for 'CAN'T 
PROTECT SH***.'

He even quoted 
his actor father Martin Sheen's famous film Apocalypse Now to describe the current 
situation, whilst violating his gag order.

Charlie allegedly told TMZ: 'I am beyond their timid lying morality, therefore I am beyond caring.

'What
my family and I are forced to deal with in the last four years, lives 
outside the pale of any acceptable conduct or decency.

'I am battling an 
amorphous enemy that needs to be swiftly disempowered.'

Charlie branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed
attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. 

He
wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. You 
are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me
and my boys (sic).’

According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned.

‘I will exercise every resource at my
disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and 
if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’
