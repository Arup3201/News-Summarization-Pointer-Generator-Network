The billionaire owner of a $90 million condominium at a new luxury Manhattan building could only have to pay an estimated $20,000 in property taxes - a far cry from the $230,000 the city is owed.

The staggering tax break for residents of One57, a stunning 95 story residential building under construction on West 57th Street, is intended for property developers who designate 20 per cent of their units to low income families.

Though the building could reap the benefit of the city's housing program, the low income renters won't be housed in the posh building and instead will be placed in subsidized units in the outer boroughs of New York City. 

Opulent: One57 will be New York's tallest residential once it opens in 2013

Luxury: The building, located at 157 West 57th Street in Manhattan, is currently under construction and was designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc

One57, New York's tallest residential building-to-be, has been under construction since 2009 and is set to open in 2013.

Full-floor apartments start at floor 77, with the Park Hyatt Hotel at the base, and the starting price for a space in the tower is reportedly $45 million.

The tower, designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc, will offer luxury amenities like a full service spa, a screening room, private dining room, a full spa and even a pet wash room.

The billionaires behind fashion label Michael Kors, Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, have both signed contracts for $50 million full-floor apartments in the tower at 157 W. 57th Street.

A sprawling 13,554 square foot apartment on the 75th and 76th floor on 
the building, reportedly sold for $90 million to an unknown buyer and the penthouse of One57, located on the 89th and 90th floors, was rumored to have sold for $95 million. 

For the $95 million property, in normal circumstances taxes would ring up to roughly $230,000 
annually but with the developer's tax benefit, the wealthy buyer could only have to hand over less than 10 per cent of the tax bill, or $20,000, to Uncle Sam.

The NYC 
Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the 
Department of Finance administers the housing program, known as 421, 
that provides a tax abatement to property developers that allocate residential units to the needy for a reduced price.

Luxury developers have taken advantage of the program, taking the tax break for units in high-priced buildings but not carving out space in those builders for lower income renters.

Instead, developers tend to provide low cost real estate in less expensive neighborhoods outside of Manhattan.

The
developer of the luxury building, set to open in 2013, has applied for 
the 421 exemption but has not yet been deemed eligible for the tax 
benefit, according to CNBC.

But just the possibility of the tax benefit for the creme de la creme of New York, is causing an uproar.

One local politician has decried the practice and is calling for an end to the entitlement.

'This is an outrageous giveaway,' Brad Lander, a New York City 
councilman told CNBC. 'We can't afford to be giving away millions of dollars in 
tax breaks for nothing.'

The tax break is estimated to have cost the city more than $1 billion in lost tax revenue, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office.

But the head of Extel Development, the company overseeing the 
construction of One57, insisted that they have followed the city's 
guidelines.

'We've had some benefit because of the abatements, but the real benefits
have been to  affordable housing,' Gary Barnett, founder of Extell 
Development, told CNBC.

'We've done exactly what the program was intended to do, which is to create affordable housing.'
