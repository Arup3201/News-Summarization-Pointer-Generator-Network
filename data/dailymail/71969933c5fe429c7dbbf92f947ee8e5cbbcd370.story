A devoted daughter and bride-to-be was so devastated that her deceased parents wouldn't witness her getting married that she decided to take her 70-strong wedding party to her mother and father's gravesides by coach.

Mother-of-four Lisa Bullock-Hoskins, 44, finally married her partner of 27 years Robert Hoskins in an intimate ceremony with family and friends.

But as a touching tribute to her deceased parents Nelly and Michael, Lisa and Rob took a bus full of 70 guests to Coney Hill cemetery in Gloucester.

Lisa said: 'I just wanted my parents, even though I don't have them now, to be part of my big day.'

Nelly Bullock, 70, had always wanted to see her beloved daughter Lisa marry, but she was struck down by Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a form of the degenerative brain disorder linked to Mad Cow Disease.

But Lisa, who lives in Matson, Gloucestershire, was so desperate for her mother to see her wearing her wedding dress that she wore the gown 
to visit her in Gloucester Royal Hospital.

She said: 'It was so incredibly emotional when I went to the hospital in my dress. There was no way I would get married if I couldn't show my mum the lovely dress that she gave me half the money for.

'It meant everything to me to see her smile when she saw me in my dress. I love my mum. I felt great that I could see my parents on my wedding day.

'I even took a picture of them with us to the church, so it was like they were there. Mum would have been over the moon and so proud to see me get married, as I am her only daughter.'

Lisa and childhood sweetheart Rob, 43, a plasterer, have three boys, Sam, 23, Tom, 19, and Alfie-Jack, six, and daughters Jessica, 18, and Ellie-Mae, two.

She said: 'Rob and I met when we were 16 and 17, and have been together ever since. My parents were childhood sweethearts too, which makes it all the more special.

'We kept meaning to get married, but one thing after another, with work and kids and that, meant that we just kept putting it off until this year.

'I'm so excited, I just wish my mum could have be there to see it.'
