Sick and injured patients were forced to wait in ambulances for up to four-and-a-half hours outside hospitals as accident and emergency departments struggled on New Year's Eve.

In Cardiff a dozen ambulances were stuck outside the city's hospital waiting to offload sick patients on the busiest day of the year because of a lack of emergency beds.

13 ambulances were seen queuing outside the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital  yesterday and people had to be treated on trolleys in a corridor as bosses declared a 'major incident'.

Some patients had to be assessed by doctors in the back of an ambulance. 

At Harlow's Princess Alexandra Hospital they were only open to the seriously ill or badly injured while in Bristol people were urged to 'act responsibly' and expect to 'wait a long time' if they turned up but were not an emergency. 

Waiting time: In Cardiff a dozen ambulances were stuck outside the city's hospital waiting to offload sick patients on the busiest day of the year

Earlier this year health bosses in Southampton issued a 'black alert' for hospitals because there were no empty beds.

It came as it emerged almost 15,000 people across Britain had to wait outside accident and emergency for more than 30 minutes in the first two weeks of December, the latest figures. In 2013 the equivalent figure was less than 10,000. 

Earlier this month waiting times in A&E departments hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours. 

Relatives described corridors resembling 'military field hospitals' with patients lining up on chairs or trolleys because there were no beds available. 

New Year's Eve is traditionally the busiest day of the year for accident and emergency departments. 

London Ambulance Service faced huge demand during the night, and tweeted: 'It's been an incredibly busy night. During peak times we were taking around 450 calls an hour.'

West Midlands Ambulance Service, which covers Birmingham as well as five other counties, said between 8pm on New Year's Eve and 4am on New Year's Day, handlers responded to 1,436 999 calls.

Today frustrated paramedics said they were 'fighting a losing battle against the system' after the ambulances were seen queued up outside the University Hospital of Wales  just hours before they faced what a health board boss billed 'their busiest night of the year'.

Staff at the Welsh Ambulance Service, which has come under fire for failing to hit Welsh Government emergency response times, warned they will never reach expected targets due to a lack of emergency beds. 

'Major incident': Problems with a lack of beds meant that patients could not be moved into Norfolk and Norwich Hospital yesterday

One paramedic in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (UHB) area, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'If there are no beds in the hospital how can we be expected to offload patients?

'We need to look at changing the whole system again. The paramedic said the situation was getting worse and has now become a year-round problem.

'It's all about crisis management,' he said.

'We are doing the job to the best of our ability. The problems stop and start with the hospital itself.'

South Wales resident Jonathan Davies said his 81-year-old father waited four-and-a-half hours in an ambulance before being admitted onto the emergency ward at the hospital in Heath.

The pensioner was suffering abdominal pains and an ambulance was called at 11.40am but Jonathan claimed his father was not seen until well after 4pm.

Speaking from the University Hospital of Wales, he said: 'The ambulance service have their hands tied because they cannot get patients into A&E. It's having a knock-on effect.

'It's an awful situation for my father but thankfully the morphine eased the pain.' 

Denise Burke, from the Act on Ambulances campaign, spent the day with ambulance crews in north Norfolk yesterday and found 13 ambulances queuing outside a Norwich hospital. 

She said a further eight people were treated on trollies because of a lack of beds in A&E.

She tweeted: '50 mins after arriving we can now offload patient from ambulance, beggars belief! Now space in corridor for trolley!'

On another occasion she said: 'We were waiting for about three quarters of an hour to hand one patient over'.
