A tummy tuck nearly killed a model’s unborn baby after the operation left her stomach muscles so tight it brought on premature labour.

Laura O’Donnell, 28, gained seven stone while pregnant with her first child but later lost the weight and so, after her fourth child, she paid £1,500 for the procedure to get rid of excess skin on her stomach.

A year later she was surprised to discover she was pregnant again but noticed that she was not developing a baby bump and was in constant stomach pain.

Nearly killed my baby: Laura O'Donnell had a tummy tuck a year before she became pregnant but the cosmetic surgery left her stomach muscles so tight it brought on premature labour of her son Blake (pictured together)

Ms O’Donnell from Cefn Mawr, Wrexham was told at 18 weeks that her unborn baby was in danger because her stomach muscles were too tight, forcing the baby to push against her right kidney.

Blake was delivered by emergency caesarean section 10 weeks premature, weighing just 3lb 13oz.

Ms O’Donnell said: ‘Blake almost died because of my tummy tuck.

‘I could feel something tearing in my belly and I thought it was the stitches from the tummy tuck coming apart.

Before surgery: After giving birth to four children, Ms O'Donnell decided against any more children and had a £1,500 tummy tuck to remove this excess skin. A year later she was surprised to discover she was pregnant again

‘Doctors decided a caesarean was the safest option.

‘I want to warn other women that having this surgery is very dangerous if there is still a chance of you having more children.

‘I don’t blame anyone for what happened. I’m just so relieved Blake pulled through.’

Doctors considered Ms O’Donnell and her unborn baby in the high-risk category and tests revealed that the unborn baby was pushing down on her right kidney. 

Ms O’Donnell had to have surgery but afterwards she contracted a water infection which brought on early labour.

High-risk: With her stomach muscles too tight, her unborn baby pushed against her kidney and so he was delivered by emergency caesarean section 10 weeks premature

She said: ‘My stomach muscles were too tight and they had been pushing Blake onto my kidney.

‘Doctors warned there were risks to me and the baby from the anaesthetic, but we had no option.

‘I just started getting contractions one day and I knew he was coming early.’

Ms O’Donnell had gained seven stone while pregnant with first child Shannon, now 10, but lost the weight through healthy eating and exercise over six months.

Her weight continued to fluctuate as she later gave birth to son Malachy, now seven, Felicity, now four, and Harvey, three.

Warn of dangers: Ms O'Donnell (pictured with Malachy, Harvey, Blake and Felicity) wants to warn mothers of the dangers of having surgery if there is a chance they will have children afterward

She and her former partner decided against more children and in 2009 she travelled to Prague for the tummy tuck operation.

Ms O’Donnell said: ‘Putting on seven stone left me with this massive flap of skin, and because I was so young I didn’t really want that.

‘It was disgusting to look at, and I kept getting infections because there was so much excess skin.

‘The tummy tuck gave me a washboard stomach again.’

After four children (including Harvey, Malachy and Felicity pictured), Ms O'Donnell said 'the tummy tuck gave me a washboard stomach again' but contractions with Blake (who Ms O'Donnell is holding) felt like 'stitches from the tummy tuck coming apart'

Tiny Blake spent four weeks on the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, Wrexham.

To repay hospital staff for their efforts, Ms O’Donnell, who has been a part-time promotional model for 10 years, has created a calendar with the proceeds to be donated to SCBU.

She said: ‘The staff there were amazing, and I can’t thank them enough.

‘Blake might not have made it without them. This is my way of repaying them.’
