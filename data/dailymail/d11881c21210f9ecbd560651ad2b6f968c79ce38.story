West Brom captain Chris Brunt has signed a new three-year contract with the Barclays Premier League club.

Earlier this summer, the Baggies had activated a 12-month option on the 29-year-old midfielder's previous contract, but he has now agreed improved terms until 2017.

Albion head coach Alan Irvine said: 'I'm delighted we have extended Chris' contract by a further two years.

Star man: Brunt has been an inspirational leader since taking the armband in 2010, serving four managers

Up for the challenge: The midfielder has extended his stay at the club by two years with improved terms

'He's our captain, has great quality and experience and is clearly a very, very important player for us.

'Chris is an influential figure both on and off the pitch. He has the respect of all the players and staff and is a top class professional.'

Brunt, who moved to the Hawthorns in August 2007, is one match away from his 250th competitive appearance for the club.

Reason to celebrate: Brunt, who scored three times in the league last year, will lead an improved squad

He took over the captaincy during the 2010/11 season, and earlier this week Irvine had confirmed he would retain it for the coming season, meaning he had served as skipper for four different managers - Roy Hodgson, Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel and Irvine.

Brunt joins England goalkeeper Ben Foster in signing a new deal after a busy summer which has already seen Craig Gardner, Joleon Lescott, Chris Baird, Brown Ideye, Cristian Gamboa, Jason Davidson, Sebastien Pocognoli and Andre Wisdom join the Baggies.
