Warner Bros. will cut the scenes featuring guns from the trailer of The Dark Knight Rises following the horrific shooting spree at a midnight showing in Colorado that left 12 cinema-goers dead.

The studio's bosses met on 
Friday at its Burbank, California offices to discuss whether to go ahead with the move in response to the massacre.

A source told TMZ that executives are hoping to replace the old trailers as quickly as possible. However, the studio risks losing millions in what is regarded as the biggest release of the year so far - and which has been predicted to be one of the highest earning movies of all time.Â

Representatives for the movie studio did not immediately respond to MailOnline for comment.

A lack of sensitivity could enrage the families of victims and alienate future viewers.

Whether audiences members continue to 
flock to the movie or not, The Dark Knight Rises will always be associated with 
the violent gun attack.

And Warner Brothers, which has made billions from selling violent movies to families and their children, faces the prospect of seeing the blockbuster sink at box offices across the country.

The studio has already cancelled the 
star-studded premiere in Paris on Friday night, and now bosses are 
deciding whether to take further measures, an executive told The Wrap.

It has also cancelled two versions of adverts for the film, Bloomberg reported. It seems a wise decision as one character, Bane, wears a face mask similar to the Denver shooter's in the trailer.

And as horrifying details of the massacre emerge, the studio has also pulled the trailer for its forthcoming film, Gangster Squad, due to a scene that shows gunmen opening fire in a cinema.

'We will continue to monitor the 
situation and adjust our security needs as necessary,' a spokesman from 
Regal theatres added, among increased speculation that entire chains 
could pull the film.

The Dark Knight cinema massacre may have been inspired by a Batman comic book strip, it emerged on Friday.

The bloodbath is a chilling copycat of
 a 25-year-old Batman comic strip which features a deranged gunman 
opening fire in a cinema.

In the second issue of The Dark Knight
 Returns, written by Frank Miller - the creative mind behind Sin City 
and 300 - gunman Arnold Crimp opens fire in a pornographic theatre, 
killing three people, after listening to Led Zepplin's classic track 
'Stairway to Heaven.'

Text from the page reads: 'Arnold 
Crimp fingers the cold steel thing in his pocket and stares at the movie
 marquee and does not throw up.

'He thinks about Led Zeppelin and how they are trying to kill him.

'He had not known about Led Zeppelin until Father Don on TV had explained it last night.

'Father Don said that Led Zeppelin hid a prayer to Satan in their song Stairway to Heaven.

'They hid it very well. They recorded it backwards.

'Arnold Crimp took the album from the 
record store where he worked until they fired him this afternoon and 
transferred Stairway to Heaven to tape.

'Then he played the tape backwards. He played it forty-seven times until he was absolutely certain that Father Don was right.'

Crimp then walks into a cinema, which is screening a pornographic film called My Sweet Satan, and opens fire.

Holmes motives behind the massacre are
 unknown, but if he was a fan of the Batman comics, then he may well 
have read the issue featuring Crimp's killing-spree.

Around 3,825 cinemas held screenings on midnight on Thursday - making a staggering $30.6 million - and the film was expected to reach 4,404 theaters across the country and 6,765 screens overseas.

Box office analysts predicted it would make as much as $198 million in its first weekend, making it the best U.S. opening ever for a non-3D movie, The Wrap reported.

The studio will no doubt feel the heat as the film, directed by Christopher Nolan, had a budget of $250 million and worldwide marketing expenses could drive the total cost up to $400 million.

The studio has been Hollywood's King of Franchises for years, generating worldwide ticket sales of $12 billion from its Lord of the Rings, Batman and Harry Potter films.

The Dark Knight Rises will be the last of the Batman franchise which began in 2005.

Franchise films are especially important
 to studios, which use big-budget movies to create theme park rides and sell toys and merchandise. But this recent tragedy could rattle their
 earnings.

Warner Bros. released a statement 
earlier on Friday, which said: 'Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are 
deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident.

'We extend our 
sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this
 tragic time.'

If screenings do go ahead, cinemas 
and police departments across the country have vowed to protect cinema 
goers from potential copy-cat attacks.

In
 New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said his department
 would provide coverage at theaters where the film is playing.

AMC Theatres said it would not accept
 face-masks, costumes or fake guns inside theatres to make all 
cinema-goers feel comfortable.

Major movie theatre chain Carmike 
Cinemas said it will use both uniformed security and plainclothes 
officers on top of its hidden security procedures 'not in the sight of 
our guests'.

Captain Mike Parker of the LA Sheriff's Department added to E!: 'While the tragedy in Aurora, Colo., 
appears to be an isolated incident, our vigilance has been raised.

'The heightened alert includes increased patrols to create a more 
visible presence at movie theatres and other places where people 
congregate.'

The Paris premier was originally 
scheduled to take place on Friday night with Nolan and the film's stars 
Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway in attendance.

But
 earlier in the day, workers took down a massive Batman mask mounted on the 
front of a cinema along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees, where the 
screening had been planned.

Warner
 Brothers also pulled an interview with French actress Marion Cotillard,
 who features in the film, on TF1, the 
country's most popular channel.

They
 have also cancelled the trailer for Gangster Squad due to footage 
showing characters firing in a cinema - an erie premonition of the 
shooting spree at the hands of James Holmes in Aurora.

Shooting spree: James Holmes, pictured left and right in 2006, allegedly bought a ticket for the film before donning ballistic gear, throwing a smoke bomb into the audience and shooting at random

He is reported to have opened fire at a 
cinema after buying a ticket to the midnight screening of the film and 
killing 12 people, including a 12-year-old.

The
 footage, which occurs at around the two minute mark, shows several 
gangsters shooting behind the big screen, before bursting through it, 
taking aim at moviegoers.

The clip shows those inside the theatre panicking and screaming as machine guns are shot.

The
 film stars Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone and 
tells the story of the LAPD's fight with the East Coast Mafia to keep 
them out of Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s.

Although
 Gangster Squad had been due to be shown before The Dark Knight Rises in
 cinemas across the U.S., it had not been shown before today's shooting 
in Aurora, the studio told E! News.

It is just one example of the violence prevalent in movies fronted by Hollywood's biggest names.

Tragic parallel: Warner Brothers has now pulled its trailer for Gangster Squad appearing before the Dark Knight Rises in cinemas across the country due to a scene where a gunman fires at an audience

There have been fears in the past that such films or TV shows could spark copycat attacks, including horrors such as Scream (1996) and dramas such as The Deer Hunter (1978).

In 2004, Donald Gonzales, 25, claimed Nightmare on Elm Street inspired him to go on a three day killing rampage in the south of England that left four people dead. He said he hoped to be like the film's character Freddy Krueger.

And in 2010, Andrew Conley, 17, from Indiana told police he identified with the lead character in Dexter, a TV series about a forensic expert who moonlights as a serial killer. He was charged with killing his 10-year-old brother.

The films in the Batman franchise are similarly gory; in The Dark Knight, audiences watch as a man's face is filleted by a knife and a bomb is sewn into another man's stomach, before it explodes.

Despite numerous brutal and gruesome scenes, children were allowed to view the film if they attended with their parents.
