Syrian rebels last night paraded what they claimed was the captured pilot of a government jet fighter.

A video distributed by a group called the Revolutionary Youth of the Land of the Euphrates shows the pilot surrounded by three armed men.

They claimed the pilot was a man called Mufid Mohammed Suleiman.

Captured: Syrian rebels last night paraded what they claimed was the captured pilot of a government jet fighter. This image made from amateur video purports to show Mufid Mohammed Suleiman

The footage shows the man (pictured) being questioned. He reports that he was on a mission to bomb the city of Mohassan

It came hours after they said a MiG fighter jet had been brought down by rebels close to the Iraqi border.

None of the claims were independently verified.

‘My mission was to bomb the town of Muhasen’ in Deir Ezzor, said the suspected pilot, who has a beard and is wearing a dark blue shirt and was seated at a table.

‘The wounds on my face were caused by the strong wind that forced me on to stones after I ejected from my plane,’ he said.

‘The revolutionaries have treated me well and they gave me first aid assistance,’ he said. ‘They are good people.’

In the same video, a uniformed man introduced himself as Abul Laith, leader of the group of rebels.

‘We will treat this prisoner in accordance with our religion and our ethics and the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners’, he says.

Video was also released of the moment the Soviet-made plane was allegedly brought down.

However, Syrian state-run media said the pilot ejected from the warplane after a technical failure.

SANA news agency said the plane was on a training mission when a ‘technical failure occurred’ and the pilot had to eject. It added that a search was under way to find the pilot.

‘Yes, we can confirm that a MiG 21 has been downed,’ said Free Syrian Army spokesman Kassem Saadeddine. ‘It was hit with a 14.5 calibre anti-aircraft machinegun.’

If the rebels have indeed managed to shoot down a fighter jet and capture the pilot, it would mark a major leap forward in their military capabilities as well as a big blow to the regime, which started using its air force intensively in the civil war over the past weeks.

The Syrian opposition has been calling for a no-fly zone over Syria for months.

The eastern, oil-rich region near the border with Iraq has been witnessing heavy clashes between government troops and rebels over the past week. Syrian Prime Minister Riad Hijab, who defected to Jordan earlier this month, comes from the region.

Apparent atrocities: Unconfirmed footage shows bodies being thrown off a building in Aleppo as the Syrian conflict becomes increasingly violent

Activists say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the revolt began in March 2011.

More than 4,000 people have fled into Turkey in the past few day, bringing to 60,000 the number who have escaped over that border.

Video of the pilot came after horrifying footage of rebels hurling bodies off a building in Aleppo emerged -  raising concerns that the conflict in Syria is becoming increasingly violent.

Three unconfirmed videos posted online today show apparent atrocities in Aleppo and include footage of postal workers’ bodies being thrown from a roof and a bound man being repeatedly shot.

Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman said that if the videos were verified, he strongly condemned such atrocities regardless of who was responsible.

Mr Rahman told AFP: ‘If these videos are confirmed, such atrocities harm the revolution.

'They only benefit the regime and the enemies of the revolution.’

The new allegations are the latest in the 17-month conflict where both sides have been accused of human rights violations.

In one of the videos, the man filming said: ‘These are the heroes of Bab city who are inside the post office.’

As the crowd gathers, people shout ‘this is a shabiha’, which refers to the pro-government militia, as a man’s body is thrown from the roof.

The bodies are said to be postal workers but it is unclear when the incident occurred.

As fighting in Aleppo continues, rebels say they will turn Syria’s largest city into the 'grave' of the Assad government. Thousands have now fled, with those left running short of food and fuel and afraid for their lives.

Another amateur video shows a 
blindfolded man, whose throat is cut repeatedly by an assailant with a 
small knife.

His blood spreads across the pavement as a group of men 
chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ which means 'God is greater'.

Both sides accused: As rebels vow to turn Aleppo into the 'grave' of the Assad government, both sides have been accused of committing horrific atrocities during the 17 month conflict

Bodies thrown: Crowds gather as bodies are thrown, crashing down on stairs in Aleppo. The footage has not been confirmed and it is unclear when the incident occurred

Shouting crowd: In the footage, people shout 'this is a shabiha', which refers to the pro-government militia, can be heard as the bodies fall
