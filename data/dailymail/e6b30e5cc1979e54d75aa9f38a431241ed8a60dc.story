The woman in the supermarket peered past my basket and into the pushchair where my one-year-old daughter, Matilda, sat contentedly munching on a rice cake.

‘Oh she’s gorgeous,’ she said. ‘Look at those chubby thighs - I could just eat them.’ As she waltzed off down the aisle, I could feel my cheeks stinging red as if she’d slapped me.

A perfect stranger had just told me how beautiful and healthy my baby was, but the only word that echoed around my head was...fat!

One-year-old Matilda with mum Debbi, who worries that her daughter may be overweight and is keen to teach her children the principles of healthy eating

Don’t get me wrong, I know how lucky I am to have a healthy baby. I actually have two. My son Sam is nearly four. However, unlike his butterball sister, he’s a whippet of a boy whom I constantly worry doesn’t weigh enough.

When Sam was a baby I struggled to feed him and he spent his first few months scrawny and scrabbling around at the bottom of the weight charts. It caused me so much heartache and distress to have a baby that was noted as ‘failing to thrive’ on his medical notes that I was positively insane with angst.

When a woman in the same shop had commented how little Sam was (he was weeks old) I promptly burst into tears.

Debbi says: 'When I look at my dear little Matilda, I can see that while she may be tubby, at least she's not obese. And, at just 12 months, she is not properly up and about yet'

So you’d think I would have been thrilled when my daughter came along, weighing a bouncing 7lb 4oz.

Unlike her brother, she was a really good feeder, and soon had those rosy, chubby baby cheeks — the sort I’d longed for when Sam’s hollow face had smiled back at me as a baby.

‘She’s got a good covering,’ my mum reassured me, as Matilda grew bigger and stronger with every week. I sat back, content that she was going to be OK, and this time motherhood would be a breeze.

But, as her little limbs became podgier and chunkier, a dark, fearful thought started to stir inside me: what if my daughter was going to be fat?

I didn’t dare confide in anyone. Especially when one of Sam’s nursery workers admired her extra tyres of blubber and exclaimed how she missed the days when her own toddler daughter was as fat as a little Buddha. She’d have been horrified if she’d known what was going on in my head.

And when I look at my dear little Matilda, I can see that while she may be tubby, at least she’s not obese. And, at just 12 months, she is not properly up and about yet.

I know — well, I’m hoping — that as soon as she starts racing around with her brother, the fat will melt away, leaving her a normal-sized little toddler.

It doesn’t take a genius or even a psychiatrist to figure out what is really going on. It’s clear that my fears and obsessions are in fact only about one person — me.

While I’m not overweight now, I did struggle as a young girl. I always had solid thighs and felt bigger than everyone else in junior school.

Then, as a teenager I didn’t feel comfortable in my ever-growing body. I hid my flabby bits away under baggy tracksuit bottoms and jumpers, and desperately avoided any parties where a dress would be required. I joined Weight Watchers at 14 in an attempt to lose the extra 21lb I was carrying. I was convinced losing weight would be the answer to all my unhappiness and insecurities. And lose weight I did.

The number of ‘oversized’ babies, meaning they weigh over 8lb 13oz, has risen by 25 per cent in the past 30 years 

With hindsight I can also see that, even at a size 14, I really didn’t look that bad. However, the words: ‘She shouldn’t be wearing that dress with her legs,’ still ring in my ears today, despite the fact they were spoken 20 years ago by one of the ‘cool’ girls on a school camp.

I doubt the girl who whispered them even remembers my name, but I hear her voice every time I glance in the mirror, deciding whether to buy an outfit or not.

These are the reasons I worry for my daughter. Nearly every woman I know struggles in some way with her body image. Either we’re not thin enough, not curvy enough or our boobs aren’t big or small enough. Now we’ve had babies, our skin is stretch-marked and saggy.

When I found out I was expecting a girl I cried for 12 hours. I was petrified of what it would mean for her and tormented myself about whether I would be up to the job.

My son, I was confident, would take after his dad — secure in his own skin and of his place in the world. A daughter, I feared, would look to me as an example and history would repeat itself.

I worried that she would spend days on end staring at her reflection, hating it, despising it, believing it would never be good enough.

It was clear from the start she wasn’t a skinny bean like her brother, but I reassured myself that it was better and healthier that way.

When the time came, I weaned her on home-cooked organic food. Barely a jar of prepared baby food passed her lips. It filled me with joy when Matilda gobbled up another homemade fish pie or cauliflower cheese and scraped the bottom of the organic, sugar-free yogurt pot I gave her. She was a pleasure to feed.

But when her full face caught the camera at an unflattering angle, causing it to balloon out of proportion, or when my mother teased that she had roly-poly thighs that might not fit the cute little trousers I had just bought her, the cold horrible jolt hit me like lightning — my baby was fat.

I blamed myself, naturally. Had I set her on a collision course to obesity by giving her formula milk when she was seven months old? What if she was fat because I let her have a bite of cake or a lick of my ice cream, rejoicing at the look of delight on her face when the sweet coldness touched her lips.

Or maybe it was my fault because, deep down, she was hard-wired to be just like me: weak-willed when food is around and utterly incapable of stopping at just one slice of cake or square of chocolate.

So when that kind stranger bent over Matilda’s pushchair and complimented me, all I heard was: ‘Fat baby, just like her mother!’

I’ve confided my fears to my husband Matt who, rightly, shakes his head in despair. He doesn’t look at our daughter and worry about her weight. He cares whether she is happy and healthy, which of course I do, too. Although he is certain of one thing: whatever she grows up to be, she must not inherit my insecurities.

We’ve discussed in depth how I must not share my fears about her weight, or the despair I feel at mine. I never mention diets in front of my children — I even spell out the word ‘fat’ as if it is a swear word they must never hear.

I know it’s up to me to make a change as well. I’m determined to teach my children how to live healthily, eat well and exercise regularly. They see me exercising and eating fresh fruit and vegetables, so I can be good role model.

I have to toughen up and sort my head out, because I am grateful for two healthy children and, as long as they are happy, the size of their clothes means nothing at all.

I’ll make certain to rain kisses on my daughter’s bonny cheeks, and enjoy them, because I know one day when she grows up they’ll be gone and I’ll miss those moments more than anything.
