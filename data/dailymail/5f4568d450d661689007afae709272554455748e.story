A doctor's wife died in front of her husband and their three sons after getting into difficulty while swimming at a beach in the Outer Hebrides.

Holidaymaker Rosemary Wickstead, from Herne Hill, London, was swimming off the west coast of the Isle of Harris with her husband David on Monday evening when the family got into trouble.

A nearby resident called Stornoway Coastguard at around 7.40pm and a rescue team was sent to help.

By the time they arrived, Mrs Wickstead had been recovered to Traigh Mhor beach but was unconscious.

She was flown by air ambulance 40 miles to the Western Isles hospital in Stornoway where she died.

Mr Wickstead, a GP a The Corner Surgery in south London, and two of his sons were taken to hospital in an ambulance as a precaution but they had not suffered serious injuries.

On his surgery biography, Dr Wickstead said he had recently reduced his working hours because it was 'important to my health and family'.

It also added that he had previously worked for the aid charity Medecins Sans Frontieres in Ethiopia and Afghanistan.

It is believed the family had rented a nearby cottage.

A mother-of-three who died while swimming on holiday off a Scottish isle will be missed by 'hundreds of people' in her parish, her vicar said today.

Speaking from St Paul's Church in Herne Hill today, Reverend Cameron Barker said Mrs Wickstead had been a member of his congregation for more than 15 years and was 'a lovely person'.

He said: 'She was a lovely lady. She was a member of St Paul's for more than 15 years and her children were all baptised here.

'They were regular attendees and Rosemary helped run one of our children's church groups on Sunday mornings.

'She had concerns for trade justice and international concerns.'

He added: 'Hundreds of people will be devastated.

'She really was a lovely person and very involved in the church and our activities.

'She was also very involved at the school as well, her oldest son is at secondary school now, but the younger two are at the same primary school that he went to, St Jude's Church Primary School.

'I have been here over 10 years and I have never hear anybody say an even vaguely cross word about Rosemary.

"She was just lovely and will be hugely, hugely, missed.'

Tragedy: A resident dialled 999 after seeing the family getting into difficult at Traigh Mhor beach

One local resident told The Herald Scotland newspaper: 'There were a lot of people around including coastguard volunteers.

'This is the first time I think I can remember a drowning on that beach.'

Waters near to the picturesque Traigh Mhor, famous as home of the the world's only beach landing strip at Barra airport, are known to have strong currents and rip tides.

Another resident told The Times newspaper that the beach is 'renowned' for strong currents and that local avoid it for swimming.

Carol Collins, from Stornoway Coastguard, said although the western coast is popular with tourists, they must seek take safety precautions before visiting.

'All the beaches on the western coast are popular destinations, they attract people because they are beautiful spots,' she said. 'But there are no life guards or flag systems in place.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'At
approximately 8.05pm police received a report from HM Coastguard in 
relation to a maritime incident at Borve beach on the Isle of Harris.

'A woman was flown to the Western Isles Hospital where she sadly died.'

A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.
