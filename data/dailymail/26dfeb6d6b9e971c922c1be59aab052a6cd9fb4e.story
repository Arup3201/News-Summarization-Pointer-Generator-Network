The case was one of 281 payouts made to teachers and assistants last year for injuries sustained at work.

Blackpool council had to pay out almost £40,000 in taxpayers' cash after a teacher slipped on a jigsaw piece

Blackpool council eventually paid the teacher £4,800 in compensation but also had to settle legal bills for the case that had reached £32,000. 

The study of town halls across England found that for every £1 in compensation paid to teachers, another £1 goes into the pockets of lawyers who often take the cases on a controversial no-win no-fee basis.

This meant the total amount paid by local authorities amounted to £7million in taxpayers' money.   

The largest payout was £114,000, given to a teacher in Birmingham who developed a stress disorder after being injured when breaking up a fight. 

Another teacher in the city was handed £32,000 after slipping on ice, £25,000 was paid to a teacher injured when items fell on them from a store cupboard and two payments of £4,500 and £16,000 were given to teachers after projectors fell on their heads. 

Elsewhere, a young pupil crashed in to a teacher on a scooter, which led to Harrow Council paying out £24,000 in compensation. 

In West Sussex, a teacher received £2,500 after complaining chemical fumes had damaged their vocal chords, while another was handed £1,500 after saying they kept getting headaches when banging in to a faulty cupboard door. 

In Croydon a teacher was paid £1,500 after dropping a heavy table on their foot, £7,500 was paid to another who slipped on a manhole cover in the school grounds and £9,000 to an employee whose hand was crushed as they moved a cupboard.

A fight between two pupils at a Plymouth school cost the local authority £53,000 after a teacher injured their arm trying to break it up

A teacher in Rotherham received £4,750 in compensation from being injured in a fall after a faulty handrail came away from the wall. The same council paid £2,000 to a teacher who slipped on some food that had been left on the ground. 

In Bromley, London, a teacher was paid £10,000 when they walked into a dark classroom and tripped over an extension cable. 

A fight between two pupils at a Plymouth school cost the local authority £53,000 after a teacher injured their arm trying to break up the brawl. 

In that case, the employee was paid £19,000 compensation, another £26,000 was paid to the teacher's solicitors and the council's own legal costs were another £8,000.  

Today, there were calls for an end to what's been described as a growing compensation culture. 

Andy Silvester, a spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Either schools aren't providing a safe environment or are paying out too quickly in spurious claims.

'This compensation culture is out of control and it is taxpayers who end up with the bill. We simply have to bring this figure down, because every penny spent on compensation is a penny that can't be spent on education.'

Christopher McGowan, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'The "compensation culture" is having a debilitating and disastrous impact on schools.

'Far from protecting youngsters or school staff, health and safety laws are robbing pupils of their childhood and encouraging adult school employees to join the dash for compensation cash.

'Many schools these days are so terrified of permitting any element of "risk" that contact play, outdoor activities, schools trips and foreign language exchanges are being restricted or banned.

'The latest evidence shows that the compensation culture has spread with a vengeance from claims by pupils to claims by school employees. It has become a compensation "free for all". Money that should be spent on the education of children is being lost to the law and to the lawyers.'
