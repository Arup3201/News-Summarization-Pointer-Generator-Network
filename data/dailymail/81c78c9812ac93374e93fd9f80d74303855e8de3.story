Tragic accident: 15-year-old Marli Hamblin died Sunday, two days after her sister accidentally backed over her in a truck while she was sunbathing in the family's driveway

A community is rallying to support the family of a 15-year-old cheerleader who tragically died after being accidentally run over by her sister on Friday in Syracuse, Utah.

Marli Hamblin was sunbathing in her family's driveway and listening to music on her headphones when her sister backed out of the garage in a Chevy truck and didn't see her.

Marli passed way on Sunday, after spending two days in a medically-induced coma and donating her organs.

'Marli’s family decided that she wanted to be an organ donor and so Marli’s miracle is she’s helping other people and that she’s living on through other people,' classmate Kendyl Hess told Fox 13.

Now friends are hoping to console Marli's grief-stricken family by helping to raise money to cover medical and funeral costs.

Chad Ritter has ordered 2,000 teal bracelets which read 'Marli's Miracle' with hopes of selling them all for $5 each and donating the profits to the Hamblin family.

Mr Ritter's daughter Whitnee was on the Syracuse High School cheerleading squad, which Marli had just recently been picked for.

'She was so excited to be able to cheer at her first football game it was the only thing she would talk about,' Whitnee said.

Charges are not expected against the sister who accidentally caused the incident.

Local police described the scene of the accident as tragic.

'It's not an easy case for everybody involved--the officers, firemen, the paramedics,' Syracuse Police Officer Erin Behm told.

Marli was one of five children in the Hamblin family.

'She was the life of our family. She kept us laughing. And singing, she had such a joy for life. And we’re just going to miss her so terribly much,' her mother, Lisa Hamblin, said.

A GoFundMe fundraising page has also been set up, and has raised more than $9,000 as of Tuesday.
