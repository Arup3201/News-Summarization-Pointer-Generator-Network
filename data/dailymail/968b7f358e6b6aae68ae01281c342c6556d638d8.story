Whether he's rocking a man bun or crucifix earrings, there's no denying that Ollie Proudlock is the trendiest resident of SW3.

So iconic has the Made In Chelsea star's look become that he channelled his style expertise into a clothing line, Serge DeNimes.

The 25-year-old has unveiled his AW14 range and modelled it in an exclusive photoshoot for MailOnline.

Style king: Ollie Proudlock from Made In Chelsea has unveiled his new AW14 collection and modelled it exclusively for FEMAIL

Speaking about the range, the designer said: 'I am extremely proud and excited to launch this AW14 collection. I feel that the brand has gone from strength to strength over the last three years, and this collection is a reflection of all the hard work that my team and I have put into making this our strongest collection to date. 

'We have come a long way from starting as a T-shirt brand, and now our product range is not only larger but, having moved to a new factory, the quality is better than ever.' 

And it seems the fashion world is embracing his work. The trendy label is currently stocked in 38 stores within the UK - with plans to expand overseas to America, Asia and Australia - and is being worn by Rita Ora and Jourdan Dunn. 

'Whether they are celebrities or not, for me it is always nice to see people with a strong sense of individuality and style wearing my clothes,' said Ollie of his fan base. 

'That being said, I would love to see some Serge on three of my style icons: Pharrell Williams, Tinie Tempah and ASAP Rocky.'

Pensive: Ollie has become well-known for his trendy style and fans can emulate his look thanks to his clothing range, with T-shirts costing £40 and sweatpants costing £60

Despite looking up to the singers, Ollie has become quite the trendsetter himself, mainly spearheading the man bun or 'mun', which he wears so well. 

So how can men pull off the mun? 'I think the key is to remember that it is a waiting game, i.e. don’t try and put it in a bun too early, as some people have done, as it just doesn’t look great,' advised Ollie.

'Just keep growing the top while keeping the back and sides trim. Then when the length on top is right, bun it up!'

So Serge: Away from the sloaney show that sky-rocketed him to fame, Ollie has his sights set on success in the creative industry, perhaps in music or art

One cast member who is a fan of his mun is on-screen love interest, Lucy Watson. 

Fans of the E4 show were left stunned last Sunday when it was revealed that Lucy  had secretly been locking lips with co-star Proudlock - but it seems things may have fizzled out already.

Speaking about his on-screen relationship, he said: 'We are good. People are asking a lot of questions about us, as the show is on air at the moment, but what the viewers are seeing, we filmed a while ago. Quite a lot has changed since then, so you will have to wait and see.'

Despite the status of their romance, Ollie is a fan of Lucy's style. 'Lucy puts time into the way she looks, and it pays off as she always looks immaculate,' he said.

Away from the sloaney show that sky-rocketed him to fame, Ollie has his sights set on success in the creative industry. 

'In five years time, hopefully I'll still working within the fashion industry. I hope that Serge DeNimes will have progressed significantly, to become a well-respected and recognised brand worldwide. 

'In terms of TV, I would love to do something within the creative world, whether it be music, art or fashion.'
