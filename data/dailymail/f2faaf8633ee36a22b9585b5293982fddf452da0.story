A worried mother who met with a primary school headteacher to discuss her son was shocked to find the teacher later posting insults about her on Facebook.

Rachel Piper, 31, had arranged to see Ruth Swailes, headteacher of Holmgate Primary and Nursery School in Clay Cross, Derbyshire, after her six-year-old son had become upset after moving classes, and had taken her mother-in-law, Roz Green, to the meeting for support.

But after the meeting, Mrs Swailes posted a comment on Facebook saying she was 'gobsmacked that some of the 
parents come to have a go at me and bring their mums along - they’re 
people in their 30s and 40s and still bring their mums to sort me out.'

Ms Piper, a housekeeper, said that, along with other comments on Mrs Swailes' Facebook page, could easily have identified her.

Mrs Swailes also wrote on her page: ‘In keeping with what I’ve experienced this week should I scream, shout, stamp my feet and threaten to beat up or kill the headteacher?'

In another comment she wrote: ‘I might get a poster, “my mum’s harder than yours” for my office.'

A friend of Mrs Swailes also weighed in, suggesting she could 'sell tickets' to confrontations, to which she replied: ‘Sounds good to me. Granny boxing!’

Mrs Swailes thought that her privacy settings meant only friends could see the exchange, when in fact it was publicly visible.

In total 39 messages were publicly exchanged between Mrs Swailes and two other people.

Ms Piper said the comments show that Mrs Swailes failed to take seriously her concerns that her son Keane Green was suffering anxiety because he missed his friends - and could also have led her being identified by other parents.

The head attacked the 'ridiculous state of affairs' in the meeting

Mrs Swailes said she was 'gobsmacked' by parents who bring their mothers to meetings with them

Mrs Swailes even jokingly suggested 'granny boxing'

Ms Piper wanted to discuss the possibility of moving her son back to his old class

She said: ‘I was worried about Keane, I arranged to see his headteacher and decided to take his grandmother with me.’

‘Keane was suffering from anxiety and he was missing his friends and I wanted to know why he had been moved out of his class.

‘She has breached the confidentiality of a meeting and failed to show concern for my child.

Ms Piper was later criticised on Facebook for bringing her mother-in-law along to the meeting

'It’s not appropriate to talk about personal details in public and certainly not on Facebook where everyone can see.

‘Mrs Swailes may not have named me but
some parents know my situation and they knew straight away she was 
talking about me.She seems totally irresponsible.'

In
a letter to Ms Piper, Mrs Swailes apologised for the messages and said 
'she had made an error' and that 'there will be no repeat incidents'.

The confrontation took place at Holmgate Primary and Nursery School (pictured)

Mrs Swailes has been headteacher of Holmgate Primary and Nursery School for four years

A Derbyshire County Council spokesman said: 'The matter had been referred to Holmgate Primary School board of governors.'

Jane Kinsell, the School Board of Governors' chairman said in a letter to Ms Piper that Mrs Swailes felt Keane would thrive in a new class.

She apologised for the comments and thought her privacy settings were for friends only.
