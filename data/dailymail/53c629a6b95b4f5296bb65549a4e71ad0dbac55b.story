A set of bespoke golf clubs belonging to Lord Lucan have been found in the attic of a practice range where they were left days before he vanished.

The gambling peer used to play and take golf lessons at the Knightsbridge Golf School.

He attended his final class a day or two before his family nanny was murdered and he disappeared, never to be seen again.

Discovered: Lord Lucan's golf clubs found at Knightsbridge Golf Club will be displayed as part of the relaunch

Mystery: The seventh Earl of Lucan disappeared on November 7, 1974, after his nanny was found dead

The nanny, Sandra Rivett, was beaten to 
death by a drainpipe at his estranged wife's home in Belgravia, London, 
on November 7, 1974.

Reports claim Lady Lucan burst into the nearby Plumber’s Arms pub at 9.45 that night, 
crying: 'Help me, help me, help me. I’ve just escaped from being 
murdered. He’s in the house. He’s murdered the Nanny!'

She later told her police her husband was the attacker who ambushed her, the nanny, and their three children.

That
was the last recorded sighting of the peer, who was declared dead in 
1999, despite numerous supposed sightings of him all over the world.

Now,
39 years later, Scotland Yard detectives have announced they will look 
again at Sandra Rivett's murder case after Lord Lucan's treasured collection of clubs were discovered during a refurbishment of the school.

According to co-director of the central London school, Steve Gould, the bag was left by Lady Lucan, who left a note asking for them to be sold in the week of the scandalous attack.

Mr Gould said: 'Lady Lucan left the clubs here years ago - a few days before Lord Lucan went missing.

'We
had a letter from her asking if we could sell the clubs for her. She 
left them here and we forgot all about them. In the refurbishment we 
found them and it all came back.

'It was so long ago we can't remember
exactly what it said. It started with "These are my husband's golf 
clubs...".

'We do not want to upset anyone at all so we will be very 
careful about the way we treat the situation, but obviously it would be 
very interesting to find the letter.'

Scandal: It is reported Lady Lucan ran into a The Plumber's Arms pub distressed and screaming after the attack. His blook-soaked car was found days later. Here they couple are pictured with their son, George

The golf club was a major part of Lord Lucan's life, as he attended numerous times a week with friends.

Golf coach David Wilkinson, 65, remembers the enigmatic figure coming in for morning lessons after a night of gambling.

Starting as a golf pro and teacher at the school in 1970, he knew Lord Lucan for four years before he disappeared.

Mr Wilkinson, who now runs the school and still teaches, told MailOnline: 'I met him in 1970 when I started working at the club.

'I was the guy that booked the people in so I saw him when he arrived and left every day.

'It was so long ago but he seemed a nice man to me. He was tall and charming.

'He was in the club the day before he disappeared and seemed to be exactly the same as he always was.'

Aristocracy: The peer, born in 1934, has now been declared dead but people still report sightings of him

Mr Gould added: 'Lord Lucan has been described as having the strongest pair of hands of any member of aristocracy. He was an interesting man and a good golfer - these would have been good clubs.

'I wasn't there at the time but Dave [Wilkinson] has always said he was a very nice chap, very smart and nice-looking.

'When he went missing, the police came to interview Leslie King but he said he could not discuss any of his students.'

The scandal that still plagues detectives today was one of the most talked-about mysteries of the time.

Although Lord Lucan's car was found abandoned doused in blood in Newhaven, East Sussex, three days later, he was never found.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The inquiry into the death of Sandra Rivett is the subject of regular reviews, as is the case with all unsolved murders. It has never been closed.

'Any significant new information will be considered.'
