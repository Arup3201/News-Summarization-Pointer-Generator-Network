A hero of the Nairobi mall siege, who was shot twice in the back, says the mental scars of the atrocity are harder to recover from than the physical ones.

Safari guard Simon Belcher, 49, originally from Pethshire, shielded a four-year-old boy under a car in September's terror attack in the Westgate shopping centre.

The father-of-two, who was shot while his wife, Amanda, watched from underneath another car, said he still struggles with the memories of the massacre, in which 72 people died.

Mr Belcher, who runs a safari guide business in Kenya, said: 'My wife and I feel safer in the bush 
among the crocodiles and lions than in a shopping centre with humans now
- it's going to take us a while to recover.

'I still have a wound in my chest where the bullet exited but apart from that my body has healed.

'The physical stuff is fine. It's the mental stuff that gets you in the dark of the night.'

Mr and Mrs Belcher had returned from guiding a safari tour days before the September 21 attack.

They were going to the cinema in the shopping centre when members of the Al-Shabaab terror group struck.

Speaking from the Kenyan coast where he is recovering with his family, Mr Belcher said: 'In a funny way it's brought my wife and I closer together.

'It sounds terrible and something you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, let alone your family - but because we both experienced that horrific day we know exactly what each other is going through and can pick each other up in the bad times.

Mr Belcher said he and wife, Amanda, feel safer in the Kenyan bush that in a shopping centre with other people

'We've shared this and ultimately came out the other side alive.'

He and his wife parked on the rooftop and went into the mall when they heard gunfire.

He said: 'At first we thought it was a robbery gone wrong but when we heard grenades going off we knew it was terrorists and probably Al-Shabaab.'

The Somalian terror group have made a number of attacks on neighbouring Kenya in recent years.

among the crocodiles and lions than in a shopping centre with humans now
- it's going to take us a while to recover,'

Mr Belcher said: 'Our intention was to
make our way on foot down the car park ramp that led out of the 
building but, as we did, we could see two terrorists coming up shouting 
and shooting.

'We then ran 
over to the opposite end of the car park where a cookery class had been 
taking place earlier. All the adults and kids who had been there were 
scattered about hiding.

'We got under two cars parked next to each other. The terrorist pair began shouting how Kenyans had killed Somalian women and children and they were here to kill all Christians and Kenyans in revenge. Only Muslims would be spared.

'Some people said they were Muslims and they were let go. Then the terrorists started shooting the rest.

'It wasn't like in the movies where the baddies indiscriminately spray round after round of bullets.

'This was very deliberate targeting. You'd hear a shot and then a few seconds later perhaps another two being fired.

'From my position I could see people's legs as they ran away. I'd hear a shot and then they'd topple over on the ground dead.

'It was very strange - things going fast and slow at the same time.'

The couple stayed frozen to their position under the cars as the terrorists went on the rampage on the rooftop.

After 10 minutes the terrorist pair lobbed a grenade towards hostages near Mr and Mrs Belcher.

He was hit in the leg by shrapnel.

'I didn't scream for fear of giving away our position, and was surprisingly calm,' he said.

'I thought "it's not hit my head or heart" so I'll survive and worry about it later.'

It was in the ensuing panic after the grenade attack that Mr Belcher saw a young boy fleeing with a woman.

'My wife and I started mouthing to them to get under the car with us, which they did. I don't know what would have happened to them otherwise.

'I protected the boy under the car but soon afterwards I was spotted.'

Unfortunately, as one of the terrorists bent over to pick up ammunition he had dropped, he spotted him hiding.

A total of 72 people died in the Al Shabaab attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September

'It was lucky it was just me he saw 
but, as he stood up, he must have signalled to his accomplice who fired 
into the car - shooting me twice in the back, with one bullet also going
through my arm as well.

'They
either must have thought I was dead or it was too much hassle to bend 
down to make sure because they left me alone after that.

'I guessed the bullets hadn't gone through my lungs or spine so it wasn't going to kill me immediately.'

For
the next two and a half hours the couple and the four-year-old boy and 
others who had joined them, cowered as the terrorists returned 
intermittently.

Mr Belcher said: 'It was very eerie. 
You could hear all the normal sounds of shopping malls - the whirl of 
ventilation units, the background music from restaurants and then 
gunfire.

'Eventually, 
private security forces - the real heroes - managed to secure the 
rooftop and start getting people out. The first wave of rescues were for
people who could walk.

'My wife refused to leave me and we were rescued 15 minutes later when they managed to get an ambulance up the ramp.

'We were taken to the nearest hospital where I was operated on.

'Later the doctors told me I was only 10 minutes from death and had suffered near fatal blood loss and internal injuries.

Mr Belcher was rescued by police and private security forces, who he said were the 'real heroes'

'But the adrenaline coursing through my body meant I had no idea what was going on and how close to death I was.'

After 10 days in hospital, he was 
discharged and, alongside his wife, is taking part in intensive 
counselling sessions to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder from 
their ordeal.

Mr Belcher said: 'I want my story to be positive - we are here and lucky to be alive.

'In some ways it's been harder for Amanda because although she's not had the physical wounds she's had the mental ones, which are harder.

'My children, who are both at boarding school in South Africa, took it badly.

'My son Seb, 18, was very angry about it all and my daughter Phoebe, 17, has had some terrible nightmares.

'But these terrorists' ultimate aim is to divide us along religious grounds. We can't let that happen.

'The little boy who was so strong throughout the whole thing got away safely in the first wave of rescues, but I've been unable to track him down since.

'It would be great to see him again to tell him how brave he was.

'Stories like him surviving are the ones to take from this experience - not the tales of murder.'
