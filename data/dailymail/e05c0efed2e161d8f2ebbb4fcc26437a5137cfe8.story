Sara Ege has been sentenced to 17 years in jail for murdering son Yaseen Ege, 7, in Cardiff in 2010

A mother who murdered her son for failing to learn passages of the Koran by heart was jailed for life yesterday.

Sara Ege, 33, beat seven-year-old Yaseen to death and then burned his body in an attempt to destroy the evidence.

Yesterday she sobbed and collapsed in the dock as she was told she will spend a minimum of 17 years in prison for the killing.

Afterwards Yaseen’s father and  teachers paid tribute to a ‘beautiful’ and ‘happy’ boy.

Ege had previously blamed her  husband for their son’s death. But a jury found her to be solely responsible for Yaseen’s death after she admitted  beating him ‘like a dog’.

The court heard that Ege had become obsessed with her child’s apparent  inability to learn entire tracts of the Koran which he was taught after school at a mosque.

On the day he died, the popular schoolboy had been due to go to a teddy bear’s picnic but did not attend because his mother wanted him to spend more time on the Koran.

After he died, Ege, who had been beating her child for the previous three months, set fire to the family home in Cardiff, and it was thought the boy had died in the blaze.

It later emerged that Yaseen had died before the flames took hold, and his mother was arrested on suspicion of his murder.

Ege, a mathematics graduate, told investigating officers she was trying to teach her son the Koran. She said: ‘I was getting more and more frustrated. If he didn’t read it properly I would be very angry – I would hit him.

Yaseen Ali, 7, was found to have died before the blaze at his home started, leading police to investigate the mother who issued a frank confession before retracting her statement

‘We had a high target, I wanted him to
 learn 35 pages in three months. I promised him a new bike if he could 
do it. But Yaseen wasn’t very good. After a year of practice he had only
 learned a chapter.

‘I was getting all this bad stuff in 
my head, like I couldn’t concentrate, I was getting angry too much, I 
would shout at Yaseen all the time. I was getting very wild and I hit 
Yaseen with a stick on his back like a dog. He would be doing his work 
and wouldn’t  complain and I would hit and hit him more and more.

‘He was a good boy but I used to get angry and he wouldn’t even stop me or say anything to anyone.’

Ege hit Yaseen with a stick, a hammer, a rolling pin and a slipper as well as repeatedly punching him.

She later told her GP: ‘It is the 
devil which is telling me to do all these bad things. I have become so 
harsh, I even killed my own son.’

Ege also told the doctor she felt ‘100
 per cent better’ after her son died. Yesterday she collapsed during 
sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court which followed her convictions last 
month for murder and perverting the course of justice.

Mr Justice Wyn Williams told her 
Yaseen had been subjected to ‘prolonged cruelty’ and suffered a ‘good 
deal of pain’ before he died from internal injuries in July 2010. He 
added: ‘This was a dreadful crime.’

Ege had previously falsely accused her
 taxi-driver husband Yousef Ege, 38, of being a violent bully who beat 
her and claimed he was their son’s real killer.

Yaseen Ali's funeral drew large crowds from the Cardiff community saddened by the loss of the seven-year-old

He was later cleared of 
causing or allowing his son’s death by failing to act to prevent it and 
told the jury he had never seen his wife raise her hand.

Both parents had encouraged Yaseen to 
attend advanced classes at their local mosque because they wanted him to
 become ‘Hafiz’ – an Islamic term for someone who memorises the Koran.

Pathologists found multiple  injuries 
on Yaseen’s body including broken ribs, a fractured arm and a fractured 
finger.

Barbecue lighter fuel was found on Ege’s clothing when she was 
arrested after the post-mortem examination.

She was found guilty of 
murder and perverting the course of justice by burning Yaseen’s body.

Yesterday her husband said of his son:
 ‘He was loved by all who had known him due to his beautiful nature and 
his high academic level.’

Ann James, head teacher at Radnor 
Primary School in Cardiff where Yaseen was a pupil, said: ‘He was a 
delightful little boy and beautifully behaved who always had a smile on 
his face.’
