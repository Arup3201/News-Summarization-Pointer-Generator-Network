There's something perversely hilarious about watching others have the pants scared off them, which is precisely what happens in the Nightmares Fear Factory.

The haunted house in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, uses actors, noises and spooky lighting - though it's almost always pitch black - in the experience that takes between 10 and 15 minutes.

While it's more subtle in its approach to inducing fear, with more of a what you don't know could hurt you-style thriller scare than blood and gore, the reactions are still priceless. 

The terrifying moment the Nightmares Fear Factory's finest work gets its desired result

The Nightmares amusement takes between 10 and 15 minutes and includes live and recorded elements

While the amusement has run for 30 years, business has boomed in recent years since it began posting the reactions of visitors in Instagram.  

These colourful reactions, usually at a point in the tour when those going through together are holding onto each other, are priceless. In the past it's been said they've been petrified and made scream by a group of ghosts while in other cases they've been made to feel like they are in a car crash.

Should it all get too much for them, patrons can use the safe word - 'nightmares' - but they will then have the indignity of being escorted out safely by staff and go onto the public 'chicken list', which has well over 100,000 members. 

Before going in, visitors can watch the reactions of others on screens in the lobby, but that doesn't seem to have any impact on them being scared witless once it becomes their time. 

Along with the actors, who occasionally come into contact with those who don't appear to appear quite afraid enough, there is a shaky drawbridge, a moment when it feels like the walls are closing in and narrow tunnel which must be crawled through.

Nightmares Fear Factory has been uploading the frightened faces of their patrons for several years

The house itself is built where once stood the Cataract Coffin Factory. 

Nightmares' legend of the building has it that the owner of the factory, Abraham Mortimer, was reportedly killed there by a pile of his core product.

'At night he was tormented by young hooligans who taunted the eccentric old man,' the attractions' official website says. Abraham would chase the riff-raff from their pranks and dares. They always laughed at his threats, until one fateful night.

'Abraham confronted a rowdy group of thrill-seekers. In the ensuing struggle, a stack of solid oak coffins overturned and Abraham was crushed to death! The guilty ran off and were never apprehended for their part in the gruesome murder.'

Not this brave three, but those who can't handle the fear factor can say 'nightmares' to escape early
