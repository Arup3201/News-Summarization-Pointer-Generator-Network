Three immigration officers are to be investigated after a judge accused them of lying, which led to the collapse of a £1million sham marriages trial.

The trial of Reverend Nathan Ntege collapsed in October when Judge Nic Madge said he was 'satisfied' that enforcement officers  had lied on oath and concealed evidence throughout the trial.

The vicar, 54, was accused of marrying almost 500 fake couples at a church in Thornton Heath, south east London, so foreign nationals could stay in the UK.

Before the case collapsed the court heard Rev Ntege oversaw a ‘matrimonial conveyor belt’ of Eastern European brides at his parish.

The jury was told the number of weddings at his church went from six a year to up to nine a day – with ‘cattle market’ scenes as brides who did not appear to know their grooms squeezing into  shared wedding dresses in the toilets.

But all of the charges against the Uganda-born clergyman were thrown out in extraordinary courtroom scenes - which included the judge accusing two officials of perjury and perverting the course of justice; defence lawyers claiming immigration officers destroyed and tampered with evidence; and five months of evidence vanishing, only to reappear at the last moment.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said today it will examine how the three officers handled evidence during the course of the operation and the trial at Inner London Crown Court.

IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said: 'We will be conducting a thorough, independent investigation into the serious matters the collapse of this trial has raised.

'We are assessing a substantial amount of material as part of our initial inquiries.'

Prior to the collapse of the trial, the jury heard that Ntege was the 'lynchpin' of a group which facilitated the 'matrimonial conveyor belt' at St Jude's with St Aidan Church.

But Judge Madge dropped the case against all seven defendants because of 'both bad faith and serious misconduct on the part of the prosecution'.

He said at the time: 'I am satisfied that officers at the heart of this prosecution have deliberately concealed important evidence and lied on oath.

'In my judgment, it has tainted the whole case. 

'It has tainted the prosecution against all seven defendants.'

He added: 'The misconduct of the prosecution, and in particular the officer in the case and the disclosure officer, is so serious that these officers have left me with no option other than to exercise my discretion to stay this prosecution.'

He said photographs and video footage as well as diary logs had been purposely held back from the trial.

The Home Office referred the judge's claims to the IPCC, which said it is now examining more than 100 boxes of material and trial transcripts as well as considering relevant Home Office policies.

All seven defendants denied the immigrations charges against them.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Home Office has co-operated fully and provided the IPCC complete access to all relevant files but it would be inappropriate to comment further as this is an ongoing investigation.'

Before the collapse of the trial the court heard Ntege was accused of carrying out 494 fake marriages, an average of one every other day, between December 2007 and March 2011.

He joined St Jude’s with St Aidan’s Church in Thornton Heath, South London, in 2002, after seeking asylum from Uganda.
