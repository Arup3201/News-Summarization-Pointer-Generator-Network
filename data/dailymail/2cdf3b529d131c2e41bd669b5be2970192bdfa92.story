Most Arsenal fans couldn't quite believe the news that Arsene Wenger reportedly turned down a move for Cesc Fabregas ahead of the Spaniard's switch to rivals Chelsea last summer.

When asked if Fabregas’s first choice was a return to Arsenal, Wenger replied: ‘Certainly, yes. But when he left we bought Mesut Ozil. We have Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and we were not in the need to buy offensive players.'

What makes things worse for the Gunners faithful is just how well Fabregas has been doing in a blue shirt, already bagging 12 Premier League assists and two goals in just 16 appearances.

If that wasn't enough, the midfielder's pinpoint corner to set up a John Terry header against Stoke on Monday night meant Fabregas now has more Premier League assists than former team-mate Wilshere has earned in his entire career with Arsenal.

Wilshere, who admittedly has been forced to miss large chunks of his Gunners career through injury, has recorded just 11 Premier League assists in 95 showings in an Arsenal shirt.

The 22-year-old made nine Premier League appearances this season before being ruled out for three months at the end of November after undergoing surgery on damaged ligaments in his left ankle.

During those nine games, Wilshere scored once and picked up one assist while Fabregas had already laid on eight goals for his Stamford Bridge team-mates.    

Febregas, who scored Chelsea's crucial second goal in the 2-0 win against Stoke on Monday night, has been one of the key ingredients to the form of Jose Mourinho's side so far this term.

Speaking recently after Chelsea's 3-1 Capital One Cup win against Derby, Mourinho was full of praise for his summer signing.

'Cesc Fabregas is playing so well for us. What I like is as a person he is a professional,' he said.

'He is a world champion, he comes here to play in the Capital One Cup and plays like that. That is the character I like.'
