A legal expert claims quizzing potential jurors on their favorite television shows helped lead to one of the most controversial acquittals in California history when Kelly Soo Park was found not guilty in the death of Juliana Redding.

In an interview about the case with 48 Hours, jury consultant Lee Meihls revealed the specific personality types she looked for, and how their pop culture tastes were an important part of evaluating their personalities.

Meihls said it was important for the defense to find someone who 'it doesn't matter what you say, they're going to start challenging you.'

Jury expert Lee Meihls said a person's viewing habits reflected on the kind of juror they'd be

Jurors believed Kelly Soo Park's DNA may have found it's way to the crime scene without her being there

In the case of Kelly Soo Park, they needed quite a few skeptics.

Beauty: Juliana Redding was murdered in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008 and DNA from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend Dr. Uwaydah was found all over her home and on her neck

Police had discovered her DNA all over the house one-time Maxim model and actress Juliana Redding was killed in, with traces even visible on her throat.

Redding was found strangled to death 
in her apartment in March 2008, the investigation eventually turned into
 a cold case.

Park was accused of working as an 
enforcer for a Dr Munir Uwaydah, a physician who once dated Miss 
Redding.

Uwaydah had lavished expensive gifts and trips on Redding and invited her to live in his mansion before she discovered he had a wife and child.

She broke off contact, but Uwaydah continued to try and woo her and attempted to establish business deals with her father to keep in contact.

'For most
 people, DNA is DNA, and it tells the truth,' Meihls said. 'So we had to
 have another story about the DNA. I felt our side of the story made 
more sense.'

The defense's side of the story was that the DNA may have found it's way there from the scene of Munir's house.

He fled the country days after Park's arrest and has never been charged in connection to the murder.

Forensic scientists said that finding mingled DNA was possible but extraordinarily unlikely.

To determine who was a skeptic, Meihls asked them about their television viewing.

Authorities speculated Park may have been acting as an enforcer for Dr Munir Uwaydah but he left the country without being charged

'One of (a juror's) favorite shows was 'The Good Wife.' I thought that was perfect,' she said. 'They're working for clients who are probably guilty but giving them the best defense possible.'

Not so promising were shows like Criminal Minds or Blue Bloods which stressed forensic evidence.

'I think this was a model jury,' Meihls said.
