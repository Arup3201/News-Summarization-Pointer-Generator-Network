The daughter of Sweden's Princess Madeleine and New York banker Christopher O'Neill was baptised earlier today at Royal Chapel at Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm.

Princess Leonore Lilian Maria will be known as the Duchess of Gotland - in reference to Sweden's largest island. She was born on 20th February in New York.

Princess Leonore is the second grandchild of Queen Silvia and King Carl XVI Gustaf's, following Princess Estelle, who is the two-year-old daughter of Princess Madeline's older sister, Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland.

Some 150 guests - mostly family and 
friends - attended the ceremony. It comes exactly a year after Princess Madeline and Christopher wed in Stockholm.

Among the guests were Crown Princess Victoria, who looked stunning in a lilac dress with a gorgeous matching satin head band wound around her brunette hair which she had pulled back into a bun.

Princess Victoria's daughter, Princess Estelle, looked adorable in a cream dress with white socks and a pretty headband.

In keeping with the lilac theme, Princess Madeline looked stunning in a short-sleeved lace dress of the colour, which she wore with a matching fascinator.

Also in attendance was Swedish model and Sofia Hellqvist, the partner of Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland. She wore a stylish short white dress and jacket with white heels and, of course, a fascinator.

Countess Gunilla Bernadotte af Wisborg wore a smart skirt suitand waved to onlookers as she arrived.

But the excitement of the Royal event seemed to be too much for some: one of the royal guards fainted outside the ceremony as guests arrived.

A fellow guard was seen rushing to his side.

As the ceremony proceeded, father of the baby Princess, British-born Christopher, gave a short speech, according to Hello.

The website reports that he asked God to, 'bring [His] love to the child for whom [He had] given [Madeleine and Chris] responsibility.'

Crown Princess Victoria then poured water into the font, which was used to baptise Leonore. The water had come especially from a special spring on Öland, a large Swedish island located in the Baltic Sea, says Hello.

It's been a big week for three-month-old
 Leonore. On Friday she was celebrating National Day in Sweden, 
accompanying her parents during festivities in Stockholm.

Dressed in traditional Swedish folk-wear, matching her mother Madeline's outfit, Leonore was held was held in her mother's arms whilst the Royal couple waved at onlookers from the Royal Palace.

Princess
 Madeleine lives with British banker Mr O’Neill in New York, where she 
works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by 
her mother.

Madeline’s
 daughter Leonore is now the fifth in line to the throne, but only if 
she takes Swedish citizenship and is brought up as a member of the 
Church of Sweden.

Leonore is fifth in line to the Swedish throne; her mother is fourth.

Sweden
 is a constitutional monarchy in which the royals primarily serve as 
figureheads. The King is the country's head of state, but his powers are
 limited to ceremonial duties.

Marching orders: Guards march at Princess Leonore's Royal Christening at Drottningholm Palace Chapel

Soldier down! Perhaps it was the excitement of the Royal christening for Princess Leonore or exhaustion from the hot weather, but a solider from the royal guard fainted during the arrival of guests for the christening
