Michael Owen has prompted astonishment after tweeting a suggestive photograph of one of his dogs lying beside another’s genitals.

The shocking picture, which the former England footballer posted to his three million followers on Tuesday evening, was accompanied with the caption: ‘I wonder if Mrs O will be so kind tonight’.

Father-of-four Owen, 35, was referring to his wife Louise, 34, then posted a further photograph on Twitter of her sticking two fingers up to the camera, saying: ‘Oh well, it was worth asking.’

The original tweet by Owen of his dogs, believed to be called Belle and Ronnie, has been retweeted 8,000 times since it was posted on Tuesday - and attracted bemusement on Twitter.

Comedian James McNicholas said: 'The timeline of @themichaelowen this evening has made feel unwell.' And telecoms expert Dan Beasley said: 'Looks like Michael Owen had a banter injection.'

Meanwhile, referring to his goal against Manchester City in 2009, a user posting under the name of 'United Religion' said: ‘That tweet and the City goal are the two greatest things you've ever done.’

Owen, who is now a football pundit for BT Sport and lives with his family in a multi-million pound mansion in North Wales, has attracted derision in the past for having a ‘boring’ broadcasting style.

Last month MailOnline reported how Owen - who retired as a footballer in summer 2013 - was hit by critical messages after starring in a 'sexist' new car advert made on behalf of a car dealership.

In the clip, he compares women to luxury cars and goes on to boast about the 'dozens' of Jaguars he owns. But the dealership behind the film, Alexanders Prestige, said it was a ‘fair comparison’.

Owen - who became an international star following his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 aged just 18 - played for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City.

Owen met his wife more than 20 ago at Rector Drew Primary School, in Hawarden, Clwyd, North Wales. Later they both attended Hawarden High School where they became teenage sweethearts.

They moved into their house in 2002, paying £1.6million for the 19th century Grade II-listed home.
