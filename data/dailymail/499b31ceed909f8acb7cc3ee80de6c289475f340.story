No one has achieved beach volleyball dominance quite like Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, but did they look to counselling for their success in the sand?

The two-time gold medallists are looking to make it three in a row in London after winning their semi-final match against China on Tuesday.

Going into the final tomorrow, the women are the same unstoppable force they were previously, losing just one set.

But when their working relationship began to falter, they sought professional help.

The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported earlier this month that May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings sought couples therapy to bolster their relationship before heading to London.

Walsh Jennings, 33, told the paper: 'We were in a funk, mentally. It wasn't physical at all. We were just in a weird place.'

What followed were several sessions with famed sports psychologist Michael Gervais, who helped them learn how to work better as a team.

Walsh Jennings told the Post-Dispatch: 'What we learned was that we didn't want to let each other down. I don't want to let Misty down. And that was keeping us kind of timid. 

May-Treanor added that an added challenge is the fact that their partnership is coming to an end.

'It's been an emotional journey that we've been on. It's been great for so long, but it's coming to an end and that's really heavy. '

The success of their compatriots, April Ross and Jen Kessy, has paved the way for an all-American final.

Kessy and April Ross defeated Brazil in the semi-finals later on Tuesday, and will now play for the gold medal against May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings.

Regardless of the winner, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings will officially pass the torch to them when it’s over.

While Walsh Jennings says she will continue playing beach volleyball internationally, May-Treanor, 35, plans to walk away from the sport for good after the London games.
