The norovirus outbreak at Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berks left hundreds of people unwell

A norovirus outbreak linked
to oysters served by Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant may have been
worse because he delayed notifying health chiefs.

The concern is identified in
a major investigation into the outbreak that left hundreds of people ill after
eating at the restaurant which has three Michelin stars.

The study, conducted by
experts from the Health Protection Agency (HPA), also found that staff continued
to work, preparing food, despite being ill or potentially contagious.

Norovirus, which leads to
vomiting and diarrhoea, is highly contagious - and the outbreak at the Fat
Duck in 2009 was the biggest ever recorded involving a single restaurant.

Subsequently, it has emerged
most oysters sourced from British waters are contaminated with low levels of
norovirus, probably linked to sewage outfalls.

Diners, including a number of
celebrities, fell ill after eating from a special 'tasting menu' at the restaurant, specifically an oyster, passion fruit jelly and lavender dish.

The HPA study reveals that
the celebrity chef, famed for his chemistry set gastronomy, did not contact
health authorities until six weeks after the first case of norovirus was reported.

Rather than alerting public
health authorities to get help in tracking the source, the chef brought in
private consultants to investigate.

It was only after they were
unable to find the cause that the chef voluntarily shut down the Fat Duck,
ordered a deep clean and finally called in the HPA and local council.

By this time, the chef
and his team had received 66 complaints of illness, while several hundred more
subsequently emerged.

Significantly, in a study
published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection, the HPA investigators
highlight the delay and point out this could have left diners vulnerable.

It concluded: 'Delayed
notification of the outbreak to public health authorities may have contributed
to outbreak size and duration.'

Eventually, some 591 people
reported feeling ill after eating at the restaurant in January and February
2009, while the experts were confident that at least 240 were likely to have
contracted norovirus.

As well as diners, a number
of staff fell ill, either through eating or handling the contaminated oysters.

In 2010, Mr Blumenthal told
the Daily Mail that the restaurant had a training manual that ensures staff who
fall ill do not return to work until at least 48 hours after symptoms have
disappeared.

HPA experts found that the restaurant ordered a deep clean before notifying health authorities, which made it difficult for them to identify the source of the illness

However, the HPA study found:
'Of those staff reporting illness, six reported working while unwell... Nine
reported returning to work prior to being asymptomatic for 48 hours and all
without negative laboratory tests.'

This also raised the risk to
customers. The study concluded: 'The on-going risk from dining at the
restaurant may have been due to persistent contamination of the oyster supply
alone or in combination with further spread via infected food handlers or the
restaurant environment.'

The experts found that the
restaurant ordered a deep clean before notifying health authorities, which made
it difficult for the authorities to identify the source of the illness.

They said: 'A 'deep cleaning'
exercise of the premises had been conducted immediately after closure and
preceding notification of authorities, thus severely limiting the potential
findings from environmental sampling as the environmental samples were taken
one week after closure.'

The Fat Duck has faced a
number of legal claims from diners who fell ill, including the TV sports
presenter Jim Rosenthal, who was left 'disastrously' sick.

He and his wife, who had been
eating with boxing promoter Frank Warren and three other guests, spent a total
of £1,346.33 on a 'gastronomic evening' which turned to 'catastrophe'.

Research published by the
Food Standards Agency last week found that 76 per cent of oysters tested from UK
waters contained norovirus at a low level.

Mr Blumenthal has refused to
serve oysters at his restaurant since the outbreak because he cannot be sure
that they will be free from contamination.

Last night, a spokesman for
his restaurant said: 'We are satisfied with all our procedures that were in
place and strongly refute any accusations of wrongdoing. 

'We co-operated with all
parties fully and transparently and received a clean bill of health to re-open
after a ten-day investigation.

'We also received full
support by our insurers who found no fault in our practices following a report
from a leading UK independent specialist. 

'There is still no guaranteed
safety measure in place today to protect the general public with regards to
shellfish and viral contamination. 

'For this reason we still do not serve
oysters or razor clams at The Fat Duck.'
