A woman trying to raise money for charity by completing the ice bucket challenge has seen the cruel side of the online craze after being soaked in manure instead of water. 

Jamie Cowling, a farmer's daughter, thought she would be drenched in water from a high pressure hose when filming her effort at a farm in Somerset.

But the 30-year-old's cruel brothers soaked her with slurry, after filling the tank with hundreds of gallons of waste.

Jamie Cowling thought she was going to be sprayed with water but was instead given a shower of manure 

After realising she is being sprayed by slurry, the mother-of-one makes a run for it but is quickly followed by her brothers' hose 

Not one to have her spirit dampened, Miss Cowling hopes the practical joke will raise more money for charity. 

'I got nominated by my sister and she had a tractor bucket full of ice-cold water dumped on her, and I wanted to do something different.

'My brothers told me they had filled the tanker with water - and stupidly I believed them.

'The plan was my partner was going to dump a bucket of water over my head first, so I was preparing for that when I literally got blown off my feet.

'I knew straight away it was slurry.

'I have grown up on a farm with three brothers and two sisters so I'm used to pranks.

'If it makes a few people smile, I'm fine with that.'

The mother-of-one had gone to the family's farm in Dinder, near Shepton Mallet for a party on Bank Holiday Monday.

Bare foot, she stood in front of a camera as her partner, Matthew Keen, stood nearby with a bucket.

The mother-of-one is able to see the funny side of the prank and hopes it will help raise money for charity 

Little did she know her brothers had already filled the tanker with waste, and were standing guard armed with a hose pipe.  

The video - which has already been viewed more than 3,000 times - shows Miss Coward talking to the camera in the rain about how she chose to be blasted with water.

She said: 'At least growing up on a farm I'm used to being out in this weather, and at least it is water and not s***'

Her family can be heard laughing as she is knocked to the ground - with Mr Keen adding his bucket of water for good measure.

'I was laughing straight away. 

'I was power-washed off with the parlour hose first, and to be honest it was worse than the slurry - it was freezing cold.

'Then I went for a shower. And another one.'

The challenge holds a special place in Miss Cowling's heart as it raises money for Motor Neurone Disease, an illness suffered by her late grandfather.

He pours the water over the man's head despite his shouting before running away, filming the older man wheeling off 

'I know first-hand it's a disgusting disease,' she said.

'If we can help raise awareness then that's great - anything that's helping.'

While Miss Cowling's brothers acted in jest, another shocking video has emerged of a yob throwing water over a man in a wheelchair. 

Speaking to the camera, the youth says he is going to soak the man in a wheelchair in the footage believed to have been shot in Manchester.  

He is then seen chasing after him as the distressed disabled man tries to wheel himself away. Laughter from the person filming the exchange can be heard. 

He dumps a bucket of water over the man's head at which point he slows down.
