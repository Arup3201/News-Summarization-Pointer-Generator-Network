The skeleton of an unusual primate, which some have claimed to be the oldest member of the human family tree, has baffled scientists since it was discovered.

Short, hairy and with long arms, she roamed the forests of Africa 4.4million years ago, but scientists were unsure whether she was more closely related to humans than to apes.

Now a team of international scientists seeking to unravel whether the African species helps to explain the origins of man, believe Ardipithecus ramidus really is related to the human lineage, based on an examination of its cranial base.

This is the 4.4 million-year-old cranial base of Ardipithecus ramidus from Aramis, Middle Awash research area, Ethiopia. Ardi's cranial base (pictured) shows the distinguishing features that separate humans and Australopithecus from the apes, the researchers said

The creature, known as Ardi, possessed a tiny brain and a grasping big toe for climbing trees, but had small, human-like canine teeth and an upper pelvis allowing it to walk like man.

Experts believe Ardi is very, very close to the 'missing link' common ancestor of humans and chimps, thought to have lived five to seven million years ago.

Now new research led by William Kimbel, a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Arizona, has confirmed Ardi’s close evolutionary relationship to humans.

Together with a group of international
 researchers, he studied the base of the Ardi’s partial cranium to 
reveal a pattern of similarity that links Ardi to Australopithecus and 
modern humans and not to apes.

Professor
 Kimbel said: ‘Given the very tiny size of the Ardi skull, the 
similarity of its cranial base to a human's is astonishing.’

Ardi's skeleton (left) revealed she was 4ft tall and weighed 7st 12oz. She lived a million years before Lucy, the previous earliest skeleton of a hominid who was dug up in 1974. Experts believe Ardi (illustrated right) is very close 
to the 'missing link' common ancestor of humans and chimps

The human cranial base is substantially different to that of apes and other primates, which is why it is a valuable resource for studying phylogenetic, or natural evolutionary relationships.

Its anatomical complexity and association with the brain, posture, and chewing system have provided numerous opportunities for adaptive evolution over time.

In humans, the structures marking the articulation of the spine with the skull are more forwardly located than in apes, the base is shorter from front to back and the openings on each side for passage of blood vessels and nerves are more widely separated.

These shape differences affect the way the bones are arranged on the skull base, so it is fairly easy for experts to work out if even isolated bone fragments belong to an ape or human.

Scientists have questioned whether Ardi 
was an ape with a few humanlike features retained from an ancestor 
living between six and eight years ago, or a true relative of the human 
line that had yet to shed signs of its remote tree-dwelling ancestry.

Ardi was found in Ethiopia's Afar Rift (pictured) and bones discovered near the skeleton indicate that at the time it was a wooded environment. Fossils of 29 species of birds and 20 species of small mammals were found at the site

In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the researchers explained that Ardi's cranial base shows the distinguishing features that separate humans and Australopithecus from the apes.

Professor Kimbel's earlier research had shown that these human peculiarities were present in the earliest known Australopithecus skulls by 3.4 million years ago.

Paleoanthropologists generally fall into one of two camps on the cause of evolutionary changes in the human cranial base.

They believe they could either be explained by the adoption of upright posture and the ability to walk on two legs causing a shift in the poise of the head on the vertebral column or be a sign of brain reorganisation in the human lineage.

'The Ardi cranial base fills some important gaps in our understanding of human evolution above the neck,’ Professor Kimbel said. ‘But it opens up a host of new questions…just as it should!’

The scattered skeleton of Ardi was 
first discovered in Ethiopia’s Afar Rift in 1994 and the skull was 
crushed to just two inches in height.

However,
 it was found to be relatively complete with features of the head, hands
 and feet preserved after researchers took years to painstakingly piece 
together 125 fragments of bone.

Before
 the discovery, scientists believed our common ancestor would have been 
very chimp-like, and that ancient hominids such as Ardi would still have
 much in common with them.

But she was not suited like a modern-day chimp to swinging or hanging from trees or walking on her knuckles.

This suggests that chimps and gorillas developed those characteristics after the split with humans - challenging the idea that they are merely an 'unevolved' version of us.

Ardi's feet were rigid enough to allow her to walk upright some of the time, but she still had a grasping big toe for use in climbing trees.

She had long arms but short palms and fingers which were flexible, allowing her to support her body weight on her palms.

Her upper canine teeth are more like the stubby teeth of modern people than the long, sharp ones of chimps. An analysis of her tooth enamel suggests she ate fruit, nuts and leaves.

Scientists believe she was a female because her skull is relatively small and lightly built. Her teeth were also smaller than other members of the same family that were found later.

Conventional wisdom says our earliest ancestors first stood up on two legs when they moved out of the forest and into the open savannas. But this does not explain why Ardi's species was bipedal (able to walk on two legs) while still living partly in the trees.

Owen Lovejoy from Kent State University said the answer could be as simple as food and sex.

He pointed out that throughout evolution males have fought with other males for the right to mate with fertile females. Therefore you would expect dominant males with big fierce canines to pass their genes down the generations.

But say a lesser male, with small stubby teeth realised he could entice a fertile female into mating by bringing her some food? Males would be far more successful food-providers if they had their hands free to carry home items like fruit and roots if they walked on two legs.

Mr Lovejoy said this could explain why males from Ardi's species had small canines and stood upright - it was all in the pursuit of sex.

He added that it could also suggest that monogamous relationships may be far older than was first thought.
