Rio de Janeiro state's top environmental official has acknowledged that the Olympic pledge to clean up their water supply will not be met in time for the 2016 games.

They promised to slash the levels of pollution flowing into the raw sewage-filled Guanabara Bay by 80 percent, but this apparently unattainable by next year's summer games.

Andre Correa said he couldn't provide an estimate of how much officials would actually succeed in cutting the flow of pollutants into the bay, where the Olympic sailing and wind surfing completions are to be held.

Guanabara Bay, which will host Olympic events, will not meet acceptable pollution levels by 2016

He told reporters at a news conference Friday he wasn't sure whether Olympic officials had yet been warned.

Environmentalists have been warning of negligible progress in the cleanup efforts for year. 

Sailors' associations have also expressed reservations about water quality in the bay and voiced concerns that it could make athletes sick. 

In December scientists at a Rio de Janeiro research institute found what they call a new 'super-bacteria' that is resistant to antibiotics in the waters where sailors will compete in the Olympic sailing events in 2016
