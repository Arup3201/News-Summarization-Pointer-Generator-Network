CLICK HERE to read why Danny Welbeck is proving to be a better deal than Radamel Falcao

Arsene Wenger has dropped a major hint that Danny Welbeck  will be shifted to the left wing against his old club Manchester United to accommodate fit-again Olivier Giroud.

Arsenal welcome back Giroud after three months out with an ankle injury but his return throws up a selection dilemma for Wenger.

Welbeck has made no secret of his wish to be used as a centre forward and, since his arrival from Old Trafford on transfer deadline day, he has scored five goals for Arsenal while deputising for Giroud.

However, Welbeck could now find himself back out wide, a position in which he found himself — much to his frustration — at United. ‘Welbeck can play in different positions up front,’ said Wenger. ‘I don’t think that will stop him from scoring.’

United manager Louis van Gaal made it plain that he let Welbeck leave because he never considered him worth a regular place in the starting line-up.

‘Here (at United) Welbeck doesn’t play every match. He wasn’t a line-up player here. He was more a substitute. He was not a line-up player with previous coaches. Then along comes Mr Van Gaal and then the world is changing.

‘No, the world is not changing. These are facts. They are not my facts. These are the facts of Danny Welbeck.’

Wenger says that Welbeck was never given any guarantees that he would play centrally

Wenger explained why Welbeck may have to move out wide, saying: ‘Welbeck had chances the other night (playing for England) when he played on the left. He looks comfortable on the left because he knows what to do.

‘One of the main reasons he came here was that he wanted to play. It was not a condition [to play as a central striker].’

Wenger said he has the option of using Welbeck and Giroud as a conventional strike partnership, adding: ‘We can adapt our formation so they can play together.’
