Serious delays over the release by an Italian court of the full findings of Leeds owner Massimo Cellino's conviction for tax evasion have been criticised by the Football League for continuing to cast a shadow over the club.

Cellino was found guilty of a tax evasion offence back in March and the Football League tried to have the Italian businessman barred from taking over the club but he won an arbitration appeal on the grounds that the offence was not one of dishonesty.

The appeal was only granted on condition, that the full written reasons of the Italian court case did not rule it a dishonest act. Those findings were expected in June but have still yet to materialise.

Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey, speaking to reporters at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, said: 'It's exceptionally disappointing that we haven't actually had the judgement, if not only to draw a line under the whole scenario so that everyone knows where they are. 

'It's a cloud still hanging over both the Football League and the club, and Mr Cellino himself.

'We are constantly monitoring it. We have been asked to be kept informed. Our influence over the judicial system in Italy is somewhat limited. 

'We have Italian lawyers monitoring it for us and we've been told it will come out when it comes out. That's how the Italian judicial system has been described to us.'

Harvey said if the case was judged to be one of dishonesty Cellino would have to sell his majority shareholding and cease being a director of Leeds.

He added: 'From our perspective he then fails the owners and directors' test and at that stage the provisions are in the rules that he has to divest himself of his interests.

'We'd obviously give the club a reasonable period of time to organise its affairs because you wouldn't want to put the future of the club at risk immediately that you had a decision. It's a matter the Football League board would have to consider at that particular time.'

Harvey also explained why the league had initially tried to bar Cellino.

He said: 'The Football League felt that the current court case in Italy constituted a dishonest act and as such should have barred him from being able to own the club. As is his right, he appealed and the appeal found that we didn't have the ability to say that.

'The actual single arbiter in the matter made it very clear that when the written reasons are issued as part of the judicial process, if it is clear in there that the act was one of dishonesty, which is the test that we apply, then at that stage he would fail the owners and directors' test and as such wouldn't be able to be a director of the football club or exert any control.'

Mixed reception: Cellino has already sacked two managers at Leeds and has divided supporters at the club
