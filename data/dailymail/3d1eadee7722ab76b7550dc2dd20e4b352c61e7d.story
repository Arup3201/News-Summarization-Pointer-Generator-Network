The secret behind the spacesuits than put man on the Moon has been revealed as a team of seamstresses from underwear firm Playtex.

They worked with engineers to design a suit capable of keeping a man alive in orbit - and saw their design work by the Apollo astronauts.

The incredible story is set to be made into a major Hollywood movie, it was revealed today.

Every Apollo suit was handmade to fit each astronaut by International Latex Corporation, a division of Playtex .

Every Apollo suit was made to fit each astronaut.

Each Apollo mission required fifteen suits to support the mission.

The main, or prime, three-man crew each had three suits: I for flight; 1 for training; and 1 as a flight back-up in case something happened to their flight
suit, thus a total of 9 suits for the prime crew.

The back-up three-man crew each had two suits: I for flight and I
for training.

The astronaut corps at that time included between 25 and 27 astronauts.

The film, to be called Spacesuit, will be based on a book by Nicholas de Monchaux called  Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo.

'A spacesuit is made out of a flight suit, a Goodrich tyre, a bra, a girdle, a raincoat, a tomato worm,' de Monchaux says in the book.

He says the seamstresses were able to sew far more accurately that other teams vying for the Nasa contract.

'They had to sew to a 1/64th of an inch tolerance without using any pins, he told website txchnologist.

'So there was no question that it was kind of a couture handicraft object versus something made according to more conventional military industrial principles.

'Like few others in the whole process, they really had the lives of the astronauts literally in their hands.'

He also believe Nasa played down their involvement in the project.

'Within the larger culture of the military industrial complex that Nasa was a part of, having a girdle manufacturer was, if not embarrassing, than certainly less than totally expected.'

The L.A. Review of Books described how, as underdogs, the Playtex team secured the contract with 
their innovative-thinking, couture-level sewing skills and sheer 
determination.

'ILC’s team [International Latex Corporation, a division of Playtex],
 a motley group of seamstresses and engineers, led by a car mechanic and
 a former television repairman, manages to convince NASA to let them 
enter their 'test suit' in a closed, invitation-only competitive bid at 
their own expense,' the review says.

'They spend six weeks working around the clock - at times breaking 
into their own offices to work 24-hour shifts - to arrive at a suit 
solution that starkly outperforms the two invited competitors.

'In open, direct competition with larger, more moneyed companies, ILC
 manages to produce a superior space suit by drawing on the 
craft-culture handiwork and expertise of seamstresses, rather than on 
the hard-line culture of engineering.'

The firm has gone on to huge success, and still makes Nasa's spacesuits.

Other ILC products include the airbag landing devices for Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions; lighter-than-air vehicles, including airships, aerostats, and zeppelins; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) masks and hood systems; and flexible powder-containment solutions for the pharmaceutical industry.

Warner Bros now plans to make a film of the project, and has hired Richard Cordiner to script it.

Shmuger’s Global Produce brought the project to the studio, and Shmuger 
and Tom McNulty will produce with Alexandra Loewy overseeing 
development. Kat Likkel and John Hoberg are exec producers and Jon Berg 
and Racheline Benveniste are overseeing for the studio, according to Deadline.
