A bishop threatened to sue a  parishioner who speculated that he would not read an email about church closures.

Philip Bannister wrote an open letter to the Bishop of Lancaster, expressing his upset about the decision to shut the Roman Catholic churches in Preston, Lancashire and merge their congregations into a new parish.

However, it was the final paragraph, in which he questioned whether his email would even be read by the Right Reverend Michael Campbell and instead looked at by his secretary, which sparked a response.

His wording prompted Bishop Campbell to accuse Mr Bannister of making a 'most serious - and defamatory - allegation.'

He threatened to take libel action, saying the comment had 'no basis in truth whatsoever,' adding he received all his correspondence and replied to all of it in person.

Mr Bannister, a regular worshipper at St Augustine's church in Preston suffered a heart attack five weeks ago and is awaiting a bypass operation.

It is not known if Bishop Campbell was aware of Mr Bannister's health problems. 

Closed: Bishop Campbell authorised the closure of two churches, including St Augustine's in Preston last month in order to form the new Parish of the Pope St John XXIII

Upset: Worshippers at both St Augustine's and St Igantius (pictured) have voiced their anger, claiming the closures were unnecessary and carried out without any consultation

His contentious paragraph read: 'I have serious doubts whether you (Bishop Michael) will read this letter personally due to a Dioceses’ wide acknowledgement that your secretary filters mail from you and takes the initiative to provide his own response.

'For this reason I felt obliged to make this an open letter which I have passed to others who will have an interest in the issues and may widen the media focus on the challenge and opportunities we all face together.'

However, the parishioner has now issued an apology to the Bishop.

He said: 'After taking a bit of advice I decided to just apologise and withdraw the remark.

'But as regards the other nine-tenths of my letter, the Bishop has avoided responding to any of the issues contained in it.

'I won’t be pursuing those points now. I think I’ve probably said enough. I will leave the fight to have these church closures to others now.'

Bishop Campbell has accepted the retraction and has said he would not be taking the matter further.

Feelings have been running high in Preston since Bishop Campbell authorised the closure of St Augustine's and another church, St Ignatius last month in order to form the new Parish of the Pope St John XXIII.

A shortage of priests was cited as the key reason.

Worshippers at both churches have voiced their anger, claiming the closures were unnecessary and carried out without any consultation.

Church secretary Moira Cardwell even threatened to chain herself to the railings of St Ignatius in protest.

Parishioners are still campaigning for a U-turn, even though both churches have now closed down. 

Mr Bannister took Bishop Campbell to task in an email which he also forwarded to the Papal Nuncio and local media.

In it he said he was 'quite at a loss to understand' why St Augustine’s had been shut down.

He added: 'I believe that, apart from the process being faulted, it has been contemptuous of parishioners.'

After being brought to task by the Bishop, he said: 'I never meant to hurt anyone. Looking at it I was probably a bit harsh.

'It was probably an error of judgement on my part and I’ve been given a slap-down.

'I have made a public apology and I don’t think I can comment any further.'

Bishop Campbell said: 'I am happy to accept your retraction. With this email I now draw this correspondence to a conclusion.'
