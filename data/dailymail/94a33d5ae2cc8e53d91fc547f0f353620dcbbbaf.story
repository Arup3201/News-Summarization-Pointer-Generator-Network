The Health Service will be given an extra £1.5 billion next winter, Nick Clegg signalled yesterday.

The Deputy Prime Minister indicated that he had secured the money after Coalition negotiations prior to next week’s Autumn Statement by the Chancellor.

He said he did ‘not anticipate a great political stand-off’ over its inclusion in George Osborne’s speech on December 2.

Referring to putting aside money to cover costs after the general election in May, he said: ‘We should and I believe we will.’

He suggested there was cross-party support for the ‘compelling analysis’ of funding needs by NHS boss Simon Stevens, which said an extra £8 billion a year would be needed by 2020 on top of efficiency savings.

There appeared to be cross-party support for the ‘compelling analysis’ of the funding needs compiled by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, he said, which concluded that another £8 billion a year will be needed by 2020 on top of efficiency savings.

The extra £1.5 billion was ‘broadly derived’ from that analysis, he suggested, adding that the Government had to ‘walk the walk and not just talk the talk’ when it came to health spending.

‘I have come to the view that we need to now agree a step-change in the amount of financial support that we give to the NHS in the years to come,’ he told a press conference.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has already announced £700 million more to help the NHS get through this winter.

Mr Clegg said: ‘We should be saying that we are not only going to make financial commitments to the NHS now. 

'We are also going to make sure that the NHS is handed over - whoever is in government after next May - in a way which allows all the millions of outstanding nurses, doctors and consultants to do so confident that they will have the backing necessary to deal with not only this winter’s pressures but next winter’s pressures as well.

‘That is very much something which is on the agenda in our discussions within Government as we prepare for the Autumn Statement.’
