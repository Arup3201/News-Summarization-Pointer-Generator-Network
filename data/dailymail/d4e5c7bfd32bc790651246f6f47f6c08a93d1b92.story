A girlfriend served her revenge perfectly wrapped this Christmas after she packaged up print-outs of her cheating boyfriend's messages to another woman and left them under the tree.

A woman who goes by 'Cassie' on Twitter (@NessLovnTrey) and is thought to be American posted pictures of the carefully wrapped present containing the unfaithful messages.

She then posted a series of images, including her supposed cheating boyfriend opening the gift and his confused-looking expression as it slowly dawns on him that he's been caught out.

Twitter user Cassie posted pictures of carefully-wrapped stacks of paper containing her cheating boyfriend's messages to other women

On Christmas morning, her boyfriend was in for a big suprise when he unwrapped the gift and was faced with his infidelity

The scorned girlfriend then posted another picture with the message: 'I don't tolerate cheating'

However it didn't appear that her boyfriend (@Bugatti_Boii_) was too bothered after being found out  - as he later tweeted in response to his girlfriend's pictures: '@NessLovnTrey247 could've mention me I would've gladly retweeted it.'

Although the truth of Cassie's cheating claims have yet to be proven, she appears to be a genuine Twitter user (with 31,000 tweets to her name) and is the mother of a young child. 

The Internet shaming of the cheater has spread across the web - being retweeted thousands of times and shared across social media sites.

Although there was lots of support for Cassie, others berated her for sharing about her relationship online. 

The twitpics appeared to have been removed from Twitter as of Tuesday afternoon. 

It's not clear whether the couple separated as a result of the surprise Christmas gift - but Cassie's last tweet on Tuesday simply read: 'Gone.' 

The supposed cheating boyfriend reads the Twitter messages that he had apparently been sending to a woman who was not his girlfriend
