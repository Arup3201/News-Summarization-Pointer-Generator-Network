Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has thanked his team-mates for helping him settle into the England squad after making his international debut against Norway last Wednesday.

The 19-year-old, who joined the Gunners from Southampton earlier this summer for £12million, capped a whirlwind month by featuring for the Three Lions at Wembley last week, and says he appreciated the support given to him by his Gunners team-mates.

He told the FA.com: 'The Arsenal players are here and have helped me settle in well. It was obviously nice to see Rickie again too, as I haven't seen him since he's moved to Liverpool - we had a good catch up.

Whirlwind: Chambers admits it has been a whirlwind month for him after making his England debut

'I've really enjoyed it. It's been a really good experience for me. I've been [to St. George's Park] before with the U19s, but this is on a different level.

'Everyone has been really nice to me and welcomed me, which I think has helped the transition from the U19s to the senior squad.' 

Chambers admitted he was over the moon to get the call-up to Roy Hodgson's latest squad, despite making only five competitive appearance for Arsenal, as he and his team-mates look ahead to their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on Monday night.

He added: 'It was a little bit nerve-wracking when I got on the pitch. It was just excitement, I just wanted to get on there and kick a ball.

'I took it all in and really enjoyed it - it was a really good day for me.

'Norway sat off us a little, but I think Switzerland will be a good test as they'll come out at us. I think we've prepared well, so we'll be in good shape for it.'
