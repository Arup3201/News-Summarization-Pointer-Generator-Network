A missing UC Berkeley soccer star who vanished in the early hours of Saturday after leaving a fraternity party 'drunk and disoriented' was struck and killed by a car, the LAPD said on Monday.

Eloi Vasquez, 19, was fatally hit by the vehicle  at around 2.30am on Saturday, just an hour after he was last seen leaving a party at the University of Southern California fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon.

His body was found on the state's 10 Freeway on a ramp around three blocks from the university's campus, his family said. However, police could not identify him immediately because of his injuries.

But on Monday afternoon, the LAPD reportedly confirmed that the coroner’s officer had identified the person who was hit on the eastbound freeway as Vasquez - a tragic end to a two-day search for him.

Death: His body was found on the state's eastbound 10 Freeway (pictured) on a ramp around three blocks from the university's campus, his family said. Police could not identify him immediately due to his injuries

It is unclear what type of vehicle hit the student at up to 70mph, resulting in such serious injuries. 'The family is understandably very distraught and has respectfully asked for privacy,' police told KTLA 5. 

The devastating revelation came just hours after Vasquez's family had offered members of the public a $100,000 reward - increased from $50,000 - for information leading to the teenager's safe return.

Earlier on Monday, Coroner’s Lt. Fred Corral had said that the county agency was investigating a 'John Doe', who had been fatally struck by a vehicle on the major east-west Freeway, near Vermont.

Shortly after Vasquez was last seen, he had called a friend saying he was 'screwed' and had lost his way. The economics major and soccer star at the prestigious school had then lost contact.

Reports said he was likely drunk at the time. His cousin Logan Crespan told DailyMail.com: 'He said he was going to the beach when he left the party but the closest beach was 15 miles away.'

Vasquez's mother, Wendy Margolin, said that at around 2.20am her son had called a friend, Aurora, Cardenas, and told her he was 'screwed' and did not know where he was.

'He pretty much said, "I need you to come over here, I need help." I asked him, "Where are you?" and he told me that he was in LA and that he didn’t know where he was at and that he was lost,' Cardenas told NBC Bay Area.  

'The second time he called it just clicked. I didn’t know if his phone died, or if he hung up.'

Addressing the media Sunday, Ms Margolin said her son was very responsible and dedicated to his studies, and that it was it out of character for him not to contact his family and friends.

Vasquez's parents drove to Los Angeles from Northern California Saturday to join the search for their son. Margolin was planning to scour doughnut and candy shops open late in the area.

Meanwhile, his friends were visiting lifeguard towers in Santa Monica and Venice Beach. A missing poster described Vasquez as a six-foot, 175lb Hispanic man with dark hair and brown eyes.

Appeal: Friends, relatives and teammates shared his missing poster in a bid to track him down before receiving the tragic news that he was actually struck and killed by a vehicle on the state's 10 Freeway

He was wearing a white and red t-shirt, white plimsolls, and gray chinos when he died after leaving the party on the 600 block of W 28th Street, a fraternity hub known locally as 'Greek Row'. 

Vasquez was not a member of a fraternity. Relatives told police he did not have any money or identification with him at the time. He did have a cell phone on him, but it appeared to have died.

Cal Athletics released a statement Sunday addressing Vasquez's disappearance.

'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,' the press release said. 'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi’s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him.'

Vasquez, born in Novato, California, was an accomplished soccer player who trained at France's esteemed Racing Club Strasbourg Alsace and the youth academy of Pachuca in Mexico. 

Athlete: Vasquez, who has trained at soccer camps in Mexico and France, was wearing a white t-shirt and gray pants at the time of his disappearance and death

Getting the word out: Friends described him as a 'really special kid' in Twitter appeals

He had also played for the California Golden Bears. 

A fellow player, Matthew Powell, tweeted a picture of Vasquez, writing: 'My former teammate, Eloi Vasquez, is missing...last seen at USC. Really special kid, keep spreading the word.'

In a statement at the weekend, the university said: 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal. 

'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi's safety.'
