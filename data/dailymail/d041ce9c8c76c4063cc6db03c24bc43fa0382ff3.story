Hundreds of thousands of Eastern European immigrants came into Britain uncounted because inspectors were at the wrong airports, officials admitted yesterday.

A damning report reveals that 350,000 people arrived unnoticed because of glaring gaps in the survey relied on by the Office for National Statistics for migration estimates.

Those counting migrants into the country went to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester during the crucial years of large-scale immigration from Eastern Europe, while only a handful attended other major airports such as Luton and Stansted, where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving.

New figures reveal how from 2001 to 2011, in many years net migration had been underestimated

In addition, immigrants on many ferry routes were barely or never checked, tens of thousands of children were missed entirely and warning signs from other statistics were ignored, the report adds.

The ONS confession comes almost 12 months after the discrepancies first emerged – and follows years of scepticism over the accuracy of its International Passenger Survey, which is based on interviews with people passing through air and sea ports.

Last May the Daily Mail revealed that the 2011 census found nearly half a million more people in the country than the ONS had estimated and that the great majority were Eastern European immigrants.

Yesterday’s report appealed for the millions of pounds spent on the immigration survey to be quadrupled to cope with the rate of arrivals. Other ONS surveys of the population in Britain suggested immigration was much higher than the IPS estimates.

The rate at which National Insurance numbers were issued to new workers also indicated that immigration figures must be wrong. But between 2005 and 2008 nothing was done to put the survey right. The 2011 national census found there were 464,000 more people in the country than had been expected.

The ONS said yesterday that most of the unchecked immigrants arrived in the four years after Poland and seven other Eastern European countries entered the EU in April 2004, when Britain was one of just three European countries to allow them in to take jobs.

Failures in the survey meant that between 2001 and 2011, net migration – the population change after both immigration and emigration are counted – was underestimated by 346,000, equivalent to a city the size of Bradford.

Nearly a quarter of a million went uncounted between 2005 and 2008 alone, when there were just a handful of clipboard survey staff at Luton and Stansted and none at all at Robin Hood airport near Doncaster.

The Office for National Statistics said researchers focussed on large airports including Heathrow and Gatwick, but overlooked the number of immigrants arriving through smaller regional airports

These errors add to a decade of mismanagement of migration estimates and surveys. Before the labour market was opened to Eastern Europeans, Tony Blair’s government published projections which said the likely future level of Eastern European immigration would be 13,000 people a year.

‘The migrants were missed due to IPS interviewing being concentrated at the time at principal airports, such as London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester,’ the report said.

‘During this time, many migrants from the EU8 countries were travelling on the increasing number of routes connecting their countries with the UK regional airports.

‘The number of routes connecting UK airports with airports in EU8 countries increased from 30 in 2001 to a peak of 190 in 2007. Many of these routes were not covered, or not fully covered, by the IPS for migration purposes prior to 2009.’

The report said the IPS has since been upgraded to cover regional airports. But it admitted the survey between 2004 and 2008 was ‘inadequate’ and improvements ‘came too late to capture much of the increased migration following 2004’.

Yvette Cooper, who has been branded 'brass necked beyond belief'

Yvette Cooper was branded ‘brass-necked beyond belief’ last night after complaining about the number of migrants in Britain.

The shadow home secretary said she was ‘concerned’ about the level of ‘cheap migrant labour’ from Eastern European countries.

Miss Cooper, who was a minister for more than a decade in the last Labour government, also claimed she did not want Britain to be ‘dependent’ on migrant workers.

The speech appeared to suggest Labour is taking a more sceptical approach on immigration, which is consistently among voters’ top concerns.

But Tory MPs demanded she apologise for Labour’s mistakes.

James Clappison, of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘It was her government that has prime responsibility for the number of Eastern European migrants in Britain because they failed to impose transitional controls … This is brass-necked beyond belief.’

MigrationWatch’s Sir Andrew Green said Miss Cooper’s speech hid ‘the absence of any real policy’ on cutting migrant numbers.

Inspectors now interview up to 800,000 of the 200million thought to be entering or leaving the country every year. Improving accuracy by a useful margin would mean interviewing four times more passengers, raising the annual cost of the survey from £5million to £20million, the ONS said.

Sir Andrew Green of campaign group MigrationWatch said: ‘This is final confirmation that net foreign migration under Labour totals nearly four million, two-thirds from outside the European Union.

‘It also shows that the peak of net migration was nearly 275,000 a year, making it even more difficult for the present government to get the numbers down to tens of thousands.’

David Cameron pledged to reduce net migration to 1990s levels of below 100,000 by the 2015 election.

‘Latest figures put net migration at 212,000 for the year up to last September. The figure is going up thanks to EU migration which the Government is not allowed to restrain,’ Sir Andrew added.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘What the latest ONS statistics underline is the point at which, in the 2000s, immigration was out of control.’ He added that despite the error Mr Cameron had confidence in the ONS.
