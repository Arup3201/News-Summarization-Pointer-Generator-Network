A leaked picture of what's claimed to be the final model of the controller for Nintendo's new 'Wii U' console, due out this Christmas shows a hi-tech iPad-like device.

The 'second screen' now also sports classic dual-joystick controls, hinting that Nintendo may be hunting the hardcore gamer market with their new console.

The second screen will be a touch panel which will display information and allow touch control of games on a flatscreen TV.

Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops by 2012 - the console is said to be twice as powerful as Xbox 360, and has a tablet-style controller which works as a secondary screen. Full details will be revealed in May

Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops in Europe, Japan and America by the end of 2012, the company announced today.

The new Wii U console is said to be twice as powerful as Xbox 360, according to the latest rumours, and features a tablet-style controller with a built-in screen.

Details will be revealed in May.

The creator of the Super Mario franchise dominated the video games industry for years with its DS handheld and Wii home consoles, but is now struggling to keep up as more versatile smartphone and tablet sales boom.   

The company plans to launch the Wii's successor, the Wii U, in Japan, the United States, Europe and Australia in the year-end season.    

But with cloud-based gaming and gaming on mobiles emerging as a potential threat, Nintendo may have trouble generating excitement about its new product, some analysts say.

Google is taking steps into gaming with Google TV, while Apple is thought to be preparing a new iPad and possibly a smart TV that could be game-changers for the industry. 

'We think we need to consider the possibility that home consoles could become a thing of the past,' Citigroup analyst Soichiro Fukuda wrote in a recent report.
