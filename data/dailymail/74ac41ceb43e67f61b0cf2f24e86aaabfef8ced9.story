A California sheriff's department has released images of clothing found with the remains of a female found in a park on January 6 in the hope that the public can help them identify her.

The body was discovered in a remote area of Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park in Orange County by a passerby along with clothing, including a distinctive jacket with the words 'Coach Williams' embroidered on it.

Detectives estimate the remains had been exposed to the elements for at least six months and the body was badly decomposed, making identification impossible.

Belongings: This jacket was found with the bones of a woman believed to be in her 30s with wavy brown hair

Name or profession: The jacket has Coach William and a volleyball or water polo ball embroidered on it

Hidden: A passerby found the woman's remains in Caspers Wilderness Park, and detectives believe they had lain there for at least six months before they were discovered

'We didn't actually recover a body. We recovered just bones,' Lieutenant Jeff Hallock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department told KCal.

Investigators haven't found any missing persons cases that match the description of the woman: a petite female aged at least 30 years with shoulder-length brown wavy hair with highlights and a distinctive gold bridge on her left jaw.

Now they're hoping that the woman's clothing may help determine her identity.

Sportswear: A pair of yoga-style pants was also found with the remains

Mystery woman: So far police have been unable to identify the woman who wore this pink t-shirt

The disintegrating jacket embroidered with the name 'Coach Williams' and a volleyball or water polo ball could be key to the case.

'Whether or not that was truly her name, the fact maybe she was involved somewhere, somebody you'd think is missing her, maybe she belonged to some type of organization or a school or something,' Hallock said to ABC 7.

Also found with the remains were a pair of yoga-style workout pants with stripes down the side, a torn pink-speckled t-shirt and a green hair scrunchie.

She may also have sustained a broken nose at some time in her life.

'Homicide, suicide, an accident - we don't have enough information to determine that,' Hallock said.

'I think our goal at this point is to determine in fact who she is. Once we determine who she is, then we can work backwards in an attempt to identify how she may have died.'
