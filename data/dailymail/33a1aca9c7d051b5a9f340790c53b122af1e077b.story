Warren Jeffs (pictured in court in 2010) has been sending letters from his cell to Utah legislators

The leader of a polygamous  sect who was jailed for the sexual assault of two girls he considered 'brides' has been sending numerous letters to Utah legislators, it has been reported.

Lawmakers have said they do not know why there has been an increase in letters from Warren Jeffs calling for repentance in recent months.  

Senate President Wayne Niederhauser said most of the legislators however have not taken the letters, which are sometimes bound in hardcover, seriously and have thrown them out without reading them or given them away.

'There's a lot of "thus sayeth the lord,"' Niederhauser said. The letters continue along the lines of 'let us worship how we want to worship, and if you don't, there's imminent warnings of chaos,' he said.

Senator Todd Weiler said he gives the mailings to Capitol visitors as souvenirs and once gave the book to a GOP silent auction, where it sold for about $30.

The letters used to arrive in FedEx shipments with postmarks from Hilldale, Utah, but now arrive through the U.S. Postal Service, according to The Associated Press.

One of the letters, dated June 14, is signed from Palestine, Texas, where Jeffs is in prison.

He is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting girls he considered brides. Members of his church, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven.

Legislative staff members have kept one of the hardcover letters, a black tome embossed in gold with the title 'Jesus Christ; Message to all Nations', in the House of Representatives' office.

The volume, which is an inch and a half thick, warns U.S. and international leaders to 'cause your habitations to be prepared for the great day of the Lord.'

The volume sent to legislators proclaims Jeffs' innocence and demands the sect be left alone

It continues, 'Officials shall fear for their lives.'

The letter proclaims Jeffs' innocence, and demands the sect be left alone and pending court cases against it be dropped.

Jason Clark, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said Jeffs receives few visitors and rarely sends out letters, although he can receive anywhere between 25 to 800 pieces of mail a day.

The incoming and outgoing mail is inspected by corrections officials for threats and contraband.

Jeffs, along with the other inmates, is allowed to make monitored and recorded phone calls, which are allowed to last for no more than 20 minutes. 

Clark said Jeffs however does not often use the phone.

In 2012, when Jeffs was held in county jails, sheriffs overseeing the facilities told CNN that he spent thousands every month on phone cards.

Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the mainstream church and its 15 million members worldwide abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibit it today.
