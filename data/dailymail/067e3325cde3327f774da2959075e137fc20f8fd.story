The nephew of the Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro followed in his uncle's sexually deviant footsteps and was charged on Thursday with 22 counts related to child pornography.

Jeremi J. Alicea, 27, of Bedford, Ohio is accused of pandering child pornography and he is also accused of possessing a criminal tool.

The court records say that Alicea's laptop was his 'criminal tool' and that the alleged crimes occurred on Sept. 17 2013, and Oct.8, 2013.

NBC reported that the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force investigated the child pornography case.

Alicea's arraignment will take place at 8:30 am on February 13.

Alicea's uncle Ariel Castro kidnapped and brutally raped three young women over a period of 10 gruesome years that 'seemed like an eternity.'

Castro was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison on August 1, 2013.

On September 3, Ariel, fed up with the 'improper' treatment in prison, hanged himself at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility.

Castro kidnapped Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight and held them captive along with a 6-year-old girl he fathered with Berry.

Bedroom windows were boarded shut from the inside with heavy closet doors and doorknobs had been removed and replaced with multiple locks. The house was divided in ways to make it more secure and to hide the existence of rooms.

Castro abducted the women from the streets of Cleveland from 2002 to 2004 when they were 14, 16 and 20.

Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts including kidnapping, rape and murder and blamed his behavior on childhood molestation and porn addiction.

He chained his captives by their ankles, fed them only one meal a day and provided plastic toilets in their bedrooms that were infrequently emptied.

He menaced them with a gun, threatened them with tales of other captives, some of whom hadn't made it home, and at one point locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage for three days while he had a visitor.

Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus were rescued May 6 when one of them broke out part of a door and called for help.

Unlike Castro's nephew who seems to have issues of his own, Castro's son has spoken out publicly about his father's behavior and has labeled it atrocious.

Anthony went on the Today Show this past June and said, 'I cannot express how happy I am that my father will never be able to hurt anyone again. Behind bars is where he belongs for the rest of his life. I have absolutely nothing to say to him.'

He spoke of being beaten as a child and of witnessing horrific crimes against his own mother.

'No one should ever have to see their mom crumpled in a heap on the floor beaten,' he said.

Anthony has made it his mission to speak out against sexual violence instead of perpetuating it.

Anthony Castro also suffered at the hands of his father when he was a child
