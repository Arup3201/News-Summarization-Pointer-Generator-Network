San Marino manager Pierangelo Manzaroli admits Thursday's match against England is an exercise in 'damage limitation' but insists his side do deserve their place in the Euro 2016 qualification stage.

San Marino are ranked joint 208th with Bhutan in the FIFA World Rankings and have never won a competitive fixture.

England are expected to inflict another heavy defeat on Manzaroli's team of part-timers, having scored 26 goals and conceded one in the sides' last four meetings.

'It will have to be a big effort,' Manzaroli said.

'Playing England is different for us because more often than not it is a matter of damage limitation.

'But we don't rule anything out - you never know when the chance will arrive to get a result.'

Manzaroli continued: 'It's going to be a difficult match and the main objective will be to come away without a heavy defeat.

'We also want to try to show what we can do and try to keep the match even for as long as possible.'

England still have four more international matches to play in 2014 and of the five other teams drawn in Group E, only Switzerland are ranked inside the world's top 50.

It has been suggested struggling sides like San Marino should have to go through a play-off before reaching the qualification stage but Manzaroli disagrees.

'We want to carry on playing in the biggest and best stadiums in Europe and we think it is our right to do that,' Manzaroli said.

'Every time we do, we show we are committed and we give our all so we want to carry on with that.

'If the international schedule is too dense and they want to take some matches away that is up to UEFA.

'But we are a member of UEFA and we think we have as much right as anyone else to play against the big teams.'

Manzaroli added: 'It is not easy to start again after every defeat.

'We have shown, however, we always regroup, we never lose heart, we play with passion and perhaps we are a good example of healthy sporting principles in a world when business rules supreme.'

San Marino, who have never conceded less than five goals against England, lost their opening Group E fixture 2-0 at home to Lithuania.
