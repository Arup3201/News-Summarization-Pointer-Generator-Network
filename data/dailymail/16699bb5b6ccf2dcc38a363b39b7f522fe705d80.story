A girl who was a starting player for her school football team in sixth grade has been told she won’t be allowed to try out again next year because the boys on the team will lust after her.

Maddy Paige, 12, was the starting defensive end for her Locust Grove, Georgia middle school’s team last season and even made four sacks. But school officials recently told her parents that she won’t be allowed to play on the team next year.

Maddy’s mother Cassy Blythe is now livid with Strong Rock Christian School and is trying to get administrators to reconsider.

Revoked: Maddy Paige was doing great as first string defensive end for her Georgia middle school's football team but was recently told she would not be allowed to play next season

‘I was told that the reasons behind it were one, that the boys were going to start lusting after her and have impure thoughts about her and that the locker room talk was not appropriate for a female to hear even though she had a separate locker room from the boys,’ Blythe told 11Alive.

But things didn’t always seem so unfair. When Maddy first started on the team, she said she felt completely accepted.

‘I was put at defensive tackle, first string, the coaches were really proud. My teammates, a pat on the back every time,’ she said.

Unfair: Maddy, top left, made four sacks last season and all it got her was sacked from the team and her school claims it's because the boys will lust after her and have impure thoughts

And she deserved those pats on the back. The young girl was first string for a reason.

‘The first sack I made,’ Maddy said, ‘all the parents in the stands thought it was one of their boys...but they looked at the roster and saw it was me and I got amazing whoops and hollers.’

Then, as quickly as it had been given to her, the gift of getting to play with the boys like she’d always wanted was taken away.

Crushed: 'It's like taking my dream and throwing it in the trash,' Maddy said

‘It's like taking my dream and throwing it in the trash,’ she said.

Blythe agrees.

‘They let her have that cake,’ Blythe said, ‘and then they took it from her and they smashed it.’

Throwback: Maddy's mother Cassy Blythe calls the decision anachronistic and has appealed

11Alive contacted the school’s athletic director Phil Roberts, who responded in an email: ‘Our official policy is that middle school girls play girl sports and middle school boys play boy sports.’

Blythe believes that sort of policy sends the wrong message and is appealing the decision.

‘What we want her to learn is that her hard work and dedication pays off,’ said Blythe. ‘And in this case, her hard work and dedication got her kicked off a football team.’
