Fans of the Hobbit trilogy blockbusters were left outraged this week after being told some of the films' most beloved characters would not be attending the world premiere.

New Zealand actor John Callen, who plays the dwarf named Oin in the popular series, took to Facebook on Friday to inform fans that he and his fellow local actors would not be attending the London premiere of the third movie on December 1. 

'Just had the word that Warner Brothers won't be taking the Kiwi dwarves of the Hobbit to the London premier because of 'budget' considerations,' Callen wrote.

'Sorry to all...'

At least four online petitions have been launched by Hobbit trilogy fans, protesting against announcements that the New Zealand dwarf actors will not be attending the world premiere of the third installment

John Callen, who plays the dwarf named Oin, was the first to inform his fans over Facebook 

The news was met with outrage by hundreds of fans who slammed Warner Bros. for the decision, that would mean seven of the thirteen dwarves - Jed Brophy (Nori), John Callen (Oin), Mark Hadlow (Dori), Peter Hambleton (Glóin), Stephen Hunter (Bombur), William Kircher (Bifur), and Dean O'Gorman (Fili) - would not attend the premiere.

'This is ridiculous. And disappointing. And simply not fair. You are such an important - no, THE MOST IMPORTANT part of these movies. You, the dwarves, the company. And this is the WORLD premiere of the LAST middle earth movie. The end of an era. This makes me so angry!!' Ulrike Pröschild wrote.

'Shame on WB! The Company of Thorin Oakenshield must follow him one last time. We want all the Dwarves for the World Premiere in London. The excuse is insulting and ridicolous. They will have to face a very angry fandom,' Cristina Salvini responded.

It has since been anounced the NZ dwarves will be flown to Los Angeles' premiere while the European dwarves will attend London's premiere

At least four online petitions have since been launched by fans from across the world, one of which was set up in the form of a Facebook page and has received over 700 likes since Callen's original post two days ago.

Further outrage ensued due to Warner Brothers funding a six-day trip around New Zealand for 150 global competition winners, alongside Air New Zealand and Tourism New Zealand .

Matt Dravitski from Wingnut Films has since told the New Zealand Herald that the New Zealand dwarves would be flown to the film's premiere in Los Angeles while the actors who play the European dwarves would attend the London premiere.

The announcement did little to quell fans' fury however, with many simply dubbing the Los Angeles premiere as 'an inadequate substitute' for the world premiere, with petitions only slightly changing their wording to specify the location of their demands.

Directed by Sir Peter Jackson, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies will be released on December 11.

The first two movies in the trilogy, The Hobitt: An Unexpected Journey and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, earned over $1 billion and $958 million respectively.
