Many security experts have already voiced concerns that fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's new iPhone 5S, are flawed and not as secure as their makers claim.

Now one leading security researcher has taken this a step further suggesting the technology could actually lead to an increase in crime, with the robberies potentially becoming more brutal.

Marc Rogers from San Francisco-based firm Lookout said: 'Fingerprints are not fool-proof and can be duplicated and as the usage of this technology increases, we can expect that duplication technology will improve as well.

'Thieves in some regions have worked out that you can force a victim to unlock a secured device,' and in extreme cases this brutality could lead to fingers being cut off.

Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now'

The Touch ID sensor is built into the 
premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as 
well as pay for shopping and apps automatically.

Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.

Yet Rogers claims it shouldn't be used on its own.

'Unlocking
 a device with a fingerprint, if done right, can be much more convenient
 than entering a pin code multiple times a day.'

'So many users fail to enable [PINs] altogether and in this case, fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all, but it provides little added security over a four-digit code.

'And because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated, they should not be used as the sole credential in a high security scenario unless enhanced through the use of a PIN code or other secondary factor of authentication.'

Apple announced that its iPhone 5S, pictured, has a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button. Apple has stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse

Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger.

Users can 'train' their iPhone to 
read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home 
button, the phone is unlocked.

Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

It uses a 'laser cut sapphire 
crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7
 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

All fingerprint information is 
encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip.

The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.

Apple has also stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse.

Paul Ducklin from Sophos Security agreed: 'Fingerprints are not secret: we leave copies of them wherever we go. Once someone devious has got hold of a copy, sensors can be fooled.'

He continues that, unlike passwords, if fingerprint information is stolen it can't be changed 'short of getting medieval on your hands with acid, sandpaper or some other hardened-gangster technique.'

Fingerprint authentication has become common in high-end laptops from companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Toshiba. Motorola also added a fingerprint scanner to its Atrix handset.

Apple unveiled the fingerprint 
scanner on its iPhone 5S on Tuesday with bold claims about its high 
levels of encryption and security.

The
 firm even suggested that its Touch ID system could revolutionise 
smartphone security and replace the traditional, everyday password. 

Apple's shares fell more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, following the launch of its new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C.

The share price ended at a 
one-month low of $467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages 
downgraded the stock.

It is
 thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets, 
especially the so-called 'cheap' iPhone 5C which starts at £469, 
claiming they weren't low enough for Apple to attract new customers, 
especially in emerging markets such as China.

Analysts predicted that Apple would 
be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China, and this 
was bolstered by the fact Apple held a mirror event in Beijing, and 
announced the iPhone 5S will also be made available in China at the same
 time as other countries for the first time ever.

Rivals including Samsung and Huawei do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce, so cost less.

Around a third of the world's handsets
 are sold in China to half a billion people, yet only 12 per cent of 
these phones are made by Apple.

Korean
 rivals Samsung is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region, pictured right,
with Chinese brands including Huawei and Lenovo also popular.

Apple
 is still a popular choice in China, but predominantly with the Chinese 
elite, and Carl Howe, vice president of Yankee Group's Consumer Research
 group told ABC News: 'Rumor has [Apple] that they make more money in 
any of the five stores in China than they do in the Fifth Avenue store 
in New York.'

Apple phones 
in China cost around the same amount as the average person's monthly 
salary in urban areas, or three months wages for a bus driver, for 
example.

The 5S is due
 to sell in China for 5,288 yuan (£547) and the 5C for 4,488 yuan (£464)
 and the handsets, which will be available from 20 September, will be 
launched in China at the same time as other major territories for the 
first time ever.

Howe continued that 
although China is Apple's second largest market, there is a large 
percentage of the population that it is not able to attract.

The phrase 'iPhone 5S' was the most 
popular search term on Sina Weibo, China's most widely used social 
network, on Wednesday, while 'iPhone 5C' didn't appear on the top 
searches list.

Users 
questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a 
smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5S model.

Apple's
 share of the China smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the 
second quarter, according to research firm Canalys, behind not just 
Samsung but also Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei and Xiaomi Technology.

'Even
 though Apple has a lower end iPhone now, its price is still considered 
mid-end in China and not low-end,' said Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based 
analyst for Gartner.

Around
 half of China's smartphone shipments are in the 700-1,500 yuan range, 
said Shen, but competing on those prices isn't an attractive prospect 
for Apple.

'Considering 
Apple's old rival Samsung and domestic players such as Huawei, Lenovo 
and Coolpad all have phones in that category, Apple will still lose out 
in market share in these key segments,' she said.
