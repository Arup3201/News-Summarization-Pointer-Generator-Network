A Mediterranean diet does little for the brain and won’t prevent dementia, researchers claim.

French scientists say there is no evidence that eating plenty of fruit, vegetables and oily fish boosts concentration in old age.

Inspired by traditional eating habits in Italy, Spain and Greece, the diet has been shown to prevent heart disease and cancer as well as increase life expectancy.

French researchers say there is no evidence that a Mediterranean diet boosts memory or concentration in old age

And recently a number of studies have implied it may be just as beneficial for the brain and could stave off Alzheimer’s.

Some scientists believe that because 
the diet is low in saturated fat, it prevents the blood vessels that 
supply the brain becoming blocked.

But academics from Paris Sorbonne University say there is no evidence for such a link.

The researchers tracked the diets of 
3,000 middle-aged adults for more than a decade and divided them into 
three groups depending on how ‘Mediterranean’ their diet was.

When the 
adults were 65 and over, they took six tests which checked their 
concentration and memory.

It has been suggested that the 'good' fats from foods such as oily fish might benefit the brain directly

The results, published in the American
 Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found no difference between the scores 
of the three groups.

Lead researcher Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot
 said: ‘Midlife adherence to a MedDiet was not associated with global 
cognitive performance [brain power assessed 13 years later].’

Furthermore the researchers said that recent work by other  scientists had also failed to find any link.

Last year, the Foundation for Public 
Health in Paris found  women over 65 who followed a Mediterranean diet 
did not perform any better in memory tests.

However, Professor Nikos Scarmeas, 
from the Columbia University Medical Centre in New  York, said there was
 not yet enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about the diet’s  
effect on the brain.
