Lord Laird has resigned the Ulster Unionist whip after referring himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs over his contact with a fake lobbying company

Two labour peers have been suspended by the party and Ulster Unionist Lord Laird has resigned his party whip after being accused of agreeing to carry out parliamentary work for payment.

Former police chief Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate and ex-cabinet minister Lord Cunningham were caught up in  two separate stings by undercover journalists posing as lobbyists.

In a statement, the party said the pair 'have been suspended from the Labour Party pending further investigation.

'The Labour Party expects the highest standards of its representatives and believes that they have a duty to be transparent and accountable at all times.'

Lord Laird earlier resigned after being targeted by the same investigation.

All three deny breaching the rules and have referred themselves to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards.

Lord laird confirmed
 that he had been approached by two BBC journalists posing as 
consultants for fictitious consultancy firm Alistair Andrews 
Communications.

It comes on the back of Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigning the party whip over the 'cash-for-access' row.

In a statement, party leader Mike Nesbitt said: 'Having reviewed the video footage on the Daily Telegraph website, and other media reporting of Lord Laird's engagement with alleged lobbyists, I telephoned his home this morning and as a result he has relinquished the Party Whip, pending the outcome of the review of his behaviour that he has already requested of the relevant authorities at Westminster.'

Mr Nesbitt was quoted by the BBC: 'Any sensible, right-minded person watching that video clip would form an opinion and that is not the opinion I would want for the Ulster Unionist Party.

'Nobody gets privilege from the Ulster Unionist Party, we expect high standards, we really do.'

Lord Laird, Lord Mackenzie and Lord Cunningham, the former minister Jack Cunningham, were all said to have been 
secretly filmed offering to become paid advocates for a firm pushing for
 new laws to benefit its business.

According to The Sunday Times, Mackenzie and Laird told how some peers 
were colluding to hide their conflicts of interest from public scrutiny.

They claimed some of their colleagues struck job swapping deals, 
pulling strings in parliament for each others clients.

According
 to the newspaper, Cunningham asked for £144,000 a year for a personal 
lobbying service to reporters posing as representatives of a South 
Korean solar energy company.

He reportedly asked an undercover reporter: 'Are you 
suggesting £10,000 a month? make that ... £12,000 a month. I think we 
could do a deal on that.'

He also claimed he could introduce them to senior figures in all three main political parties.

The Mail on Sunday understands Lord Laird will feature with Mr Mercer in a Panorama exposé due to be broadcast this week.

The
 former PR executive insisted he had not broken any rules because he had
 never agreed to act on the fake consultancy’s behalf, nor accepted any 
money.

LORD LAIRD

Lords Cunningham and Mackenzie both also stressed they had not broken any rules.

Lord Laird claimed he believed the 'sting' was a scam from the start but has since referred himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs and to Black Rod, the House’s senior official.

'In recent days I have been the subject of a scam operated by journalists masquerading as communications consultants," he said in a statement.

'This has led to allegations that I have broken the rules of the House of Lords.

'I wish to make it clear that I did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services.'

He said that because he suspected a scam, he took a journalist to the meeting as a witness.

'Shortly after the meeting, because it was so obviously a scam, we reported it to the appropriate authorities in the Lords.

'I have not broken any rules. However, I have referred the situation to the appropriate authorities and I will be making no further statement until I have received their ruling.'

Mr Mercer, a former Tory frontbencher, resigned the party whip last week after he was accused of taking £4,000 to lobby and ask parliamentary questions on behalf of Fiji.

The MP for Newark is also accused of 
agreeing to provide a parliamentary pass for a representative of a 
fictional Fijian client.

Mr Mercer said he was taking legal advice on the allegations but had resigned the whip ‘to save my party embarrassment’.

Nick Clegg: Pressing ahead with a register of lobbyists

He announced that he would stand down at the next Election but is facing pressure from Tory colleagues to quit now.

The
 row has led to fresh calls on David Cameron to introduce a ‘right of 
recall’ allowing voters to sack misbehaving MPs and to set up an 
official register of lobbyists.

Last
 night the Mercer affair deepened after several MPs from both major 
parties admitted that they had joined the all-party parliamentary group 
(APPG) on Fiji after being invited by the disgraced MP.

Mr
 Mercer was reported to have dismissively described them as ‘several 
freeloaders that would like to go to Fiji’ – including one who asked to 
take his wife.

The MPs he 
persuaded to join included Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home 
Affairs select committee, and Conservative MPs Julian Brazier and Mark 
Field.

A Labour spokesman said: 'The 
Labour Party expects all peers to comply with the Lords Code of Conduct,
 which is there to bring clarity to their dealings with outside 
commercial interests and consultancies.

'We demand high standards of behaviour from our parliamentarians.

'Where there is genuine evidence of 
wrongdoing, including non-compliance with the code of conduct, the 
Labour Party will consider appropriate disciplinary action as and when 
necessary.'

The MPs' code of conduct prohibits 'paid advocacy' and requires the declaration of financial interests.

Tory Monmouth MP David Davies has 
revealed that he was among those targeted by the Panorama sting, but 
insisted he refused the offer of lobbying work.

Mr Mercer tabled questions to 
ministers in May about Fiji and also tabled a motion saying there was 
'no justification for Fiji's continued suspension from the 
Commonwealth'.

Mr Mercer reportedly boasted to the 
undercover reporters that among 18 MPs he signed up were 'several 
freeloaders that would like to go to Fiji'.

Labour MP keith Vaz was invited to join a group representing Fiji but was not offered a trip to the island

A spokesman for Mr Vaz said he was a member of several such groups but had not been offered a visit to Fiji.

'He fully supports Fiji's suspension 
from the Commonwealth which should remain until there are free and fair 
elections. This reflects the views of his Fijian origin constituents,' he said.

His sister Valerie told the newspaper
 that she had an interest in human rights and democracy and was keen to 
see discussion about Fiji among British MPs.

Mr Field said it was a 'routine 
thing' to sign up as a qualifying member of a new group and it had not 
struck him as improper and Mr Hamilton said that despite knowing nothing
 about Fiji it was 'not uncommon for MPs to canvass other MPs...to get 
the APPG off the ground'.

Mr Brazier told the newspaper: 'I 
from time to time enjoy, very occasionally, doing a nice visit somewhere
 and if you join an APPG there's always the possibility you may visit 
that country.'

A review into APPGs was announced by 
the Commons standards committee in January following a working group set
 up by Speaker John Bercow whose recommendations included the need for 'greater transparency.'

The Fiji group was never formally registered.

The controversy has reignited calls 
for the Government to press ahead with promised legislation both for a 
statutory register of lobbyists and the power for constituents to 'recall' MPs who breach the rules.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has 
made clear his determination to secure the register - blaming the Tories
 for the lack of action.

Calling for cross-party talks on a 
register, shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett MP said: 'We have 
seen no action from this Tory-led Government, despite David Cameron 
himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to 
happen.'

David Prince, interim chairman of the
 Committee on Standards in Public Life, said it warned in January that 
lobbying remained a 'significant and continuing risk to ethical 
standards' but that a register would not solve all the problems.
