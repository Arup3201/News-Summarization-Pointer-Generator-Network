Kerry Dixon faces the sack from Chelsea after he was arrested on suspicion of dealing cocaine.

The former Chelsea striker, who works for the club in various roles, has been questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.

Dixon, 52, frequently appears on the club’s in-house station, Chelsea TV, as a pundit but it is only on a freelance basis.

He is also booked for regular appearances in matchday hospitality lounges, where he entertains guests with stories from the Eighties.

Dixon, who scored 193 goals for the club, has also been involved with stadium tours.

He is a 
popular figure at Stamford Bridge,  particularly among the hard-core 
supporters who watched Chelsea when they were in the old Second 
Division.

Chelsea
 are refusing to comment on Dixon’s arrest, but have made it clear that 
he only ever works for the club on an ad-hoc basis.

After
 a chequered history following retirement from the professional game, 
Dixon has made something of a comeback at the club in recent years.

He 
is third on Chelsea’s all-time goalscorers’ list behind Frank Lampard 
and Bobby Tambling after a nine-year spell at the club.

Dixon began his career at non-League Chesham United, before he got his big break with Reading in 1980.

He went on to play for Chelsea, Southampton, Luton, Millwall, Watford and Doncaster.

Dixon
 played eight times for England and scored twice in a 3-0 win over West 
Germany in 1985 when Bobby Robson’s squad were acclimatising to the conditions in Mexico ahead of the following year's World Cup.

Dixon was unavailable for comment on Thursday night.
