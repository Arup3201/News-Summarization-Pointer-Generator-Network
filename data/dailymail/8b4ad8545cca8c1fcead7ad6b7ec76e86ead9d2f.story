This is the dramatic moment an armed robber, disguised as a Muslim woman in a burka, blagged his way into a jewellery store, and was followed by three accomplices who stole £30,000 of valuables in a gems raid. 

He rang the bell of the Burnley store posing as a female customer, but as he was let in by unsuspecting staff, three of his gang followed wielding a rifle, sword and baseball bats.

They began smashing up the glass display cabinets and made off with their haul.

Deception: He rang the bell of the Burnley store posing as a female customer, but as he was let in by unsuspecting staff, three accomplices burst in behind him wielding a rifle, sword and baseball bats

During the raid last February, the gunmen pointed the rifle at the staff as they put up their hands in fear.

The man in the burka pulled out a sword from under his cloak and began 
stuffing a bag full of traditional Asian jewels.

One of the gang kept watch outside and threatened onlookers with a baseball bat as his accomplices looted the store.

The shop owner was said to be 'very shaken' following the ordeal, but escaped unhurt.

The CCTV footage of the raid on 
February 19 last year at Muzaffar Jewellers in Burnley, Lancashire 
emerged as the four men were jailed for a total of 42 years after they 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit armed robberies.

Rais
Atcha, 20, of Burwell Close, Bolton was jailed for 12 years, Fahim 
Kola, 19, of Bolton got 10 years and eight months, 
Mohammed Asif Khan, 26, of Bolton was given nine years 
and four months and Baber Khan, 25, of Bolton was jailed 
for 10 years and eight months.

None has admitted wearing the burka and police are unsure which of the looters was behind the stunt.

Preston Crown Court was told in a 
separate raid £3000 of cash and jewellery was stolen after the residents
- a 74-year-old man and 63-year-old woman - were threatened and 
assaulted with a gun and an axe.

In
a third raid at Bolton an elderly couple were tied up in a bedroom 
while the robbers threatened to kill them if they did not hand over 
their cash and jewellery.

One
of the robbers knocked on the door before the three men, who had hoods 
and scarves and were carrying an axe, a hammer and a baseball bat, burst
in and attacked the elderly residents.

Guilty: Mohammed Asif Khan, 26, left, was given nine years and four months and Baber Khan, 25, right was jailed for ten years and eight months

Target: The CCTV footage of the raid on February 19 last year at Muzaffar Jewellers in Burnley, Lancashire emerged as four men were jailed for a total of 42 years

The terrified 86 and 79- year-old were left extremely shaken after the attack.

Lancashire police, who worked with Bolton CID during the investigation, said it was a long and complex process involving forensics, telephone evidence and witnesses.

Atcha and Kola claimed they had gambling debts.

But passing sentence Judge Pamela Badley said: 'Each of these offences were serious criminal enterprises.

'The robbery at the jewellers was caught on CCTV and I saw the images. Entry was gained by a person in a full burka closely followed by three men in balaclavas carrying a gun, sword and a baseball bat.

'They proceeded to smash the cabinet and take the jewellery. It is estimated between £25-30,000 of jewellery was stolen. This was an organised, high violence robbery and these are very grave offences.'

Det Sgt Nicola Bithell said: 'This has been a long and complex inquiry and I am satisfied with the result.

'This group of men used extreme violence and weapons to threaten the victims leaving them terrified and traumatised.

'We have worked extremely hard with Greater Manchester Police throughout the investigation and I hope it sends a strong message out to those who think they can come into Lancashire to commit crime that they will be targeted and brought to justice.'
