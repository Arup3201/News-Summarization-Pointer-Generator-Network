The first day of Royal Ascot got off to a glamorous start today as hundreds of punters descended on one of the world’s most popular sporting events. 

The Berkshire race meeting has become much more than horses and royalty in recent years with fashion, in particular outlandish hats, taking centre stage.

Simon Cowell’s ex girlfriend and racegoer Jackie St Clair wore one of the day's most eye-catching headpieces; a huge giant blue butterfly-shaped design.

Former Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf and Ultimo boss Michelle Mone opted for much less extravagant designs.

Other celebrity guests included TV presenters Clare Balding, Lizzie Cundy, Eamonn Holmes, Bruce Forsyth and Nick Knowles.

From today until Saturday, there are a total of 30 races with prize money of £5.3m up for grabs.

The Queen is in attendance everyday and her horse Estimate races on Thursday, Ladies Day.
