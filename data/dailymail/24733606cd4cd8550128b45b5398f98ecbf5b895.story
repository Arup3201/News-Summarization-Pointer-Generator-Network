Prince Charles is to demand a total overhaul of the honours system when he becomes king in the belief gongs are handed out for the wrong reasons

Prince Charles will demand a total overhaul of the honours system when he becomes king.

The heir to the throne believes gongs are handed out ‘to the wrong people for the wrong reasons’. 

He is said to want to scrap honours such as the CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

Modern and egalitarian awards would be brought in instead, possibly in smaller numbers. ‘Why should people still be invested with an order of a defunct British empire?’ one member of the prince’s inner circle told the Mail.

Charles, who stood in for the Queen at an investiture yesterday, also thinks the honours ceremonies should be a celebration.

A figure close to him said a party would be more suitable, adding: ‘It’s a shame that after receiving an honour at the palace, recipients have to leave. How much more appropriate it would be for the occasion to be marked by a party.’

The startling insight into the thinking of a prince often accused of meddling in national affairs was among many offered by aides who have spoken to the Mail for a remarkable series, beginning today.

A major biography is also being published which claims the Prince of Wales wants to reshape not only the monarchy, but the country itself when he accedes to the throne.

In a previously unpublished interview with the author, the prince says he is determined to fix the ‘battered’ world.

‘I only take on the most difficult challenges. Because I want to raise aspirations and create hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation,’ he says.

Catherine Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, was given unprecedented access to the prince, as well as his closest friends and advisers at Clarence House, for the first semi-authorised biography in years.

She describes Charles as a man ‘set to reshape the monarchy in his own image’ and one who ‘will never be remote and silent like his own mother’.

Miss Mayer’s book also: 

A biography to be published next month claims the Prince of Wales wants to reshape not only the monarchy, but the country itself when he accedes to the throne

Even though its text is largely complimentary, the timing of the book is not ideal for Charles and his team.

Next month the Supreme Court will rule on whether 27 ‘black spider memos’ written by the prince to ministers airing his views on issues of national importance should be published.

Senior aides are resigned to the fact that Charles is likely to lose his decade-long battle to keep the notes secret and are preparing themselves for the fallout.

The court ruling will be followed by a BBC documentary shedding light on the ‘War of the Wales’ and efforts by the prince’s staff to undermine Diana.

The new biography offers a different view, sensationally referring to Diana’s attempts to ‘spread word about her husband’s derelictions’.

It says: ‘His camp fought back, but without the same skills and hampered by a principal who could never match Diana’s lustre or her bloodlust.’

One member of his inner circle told the Mail: ‘Does he meddle? Yes, sometimes. Is he misguided on occasions? Possibly. But does he do it for the best of reasons? Absolutely. He is a very good man and what he does comes from a good place.’
