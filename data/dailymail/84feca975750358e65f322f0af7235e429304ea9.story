As a former England footballer, he might not be the first person you would expect to deliver  an impassioned critique of the literary canon.

But John Barnes has blamed authors such as Agatha Christie, Rudyard Kipling and Edgar Rice Burroughs for making Britain a country of ‘passive racists’.

The ex-Liverpool winger insisted classic tales such as Ten Little Indians, Tarzan of the Apes and The Jungle Book have instilled bigotry in the minds of generations of British children.

Bigotry: England footballer, John Barnes told students at Liverpool University that 'passive racism' was in everyone because of hundreds of years of subtle bigotry in British culture

Barnes launched his fierce attack on literature in a lecture to students at Liverpool University about the causes of racism in football.

The father of seven told the audience that ‘passive racism is inherent in all of us’ because of ‘preconceived ideas’ planted through books and films.

He said: ‘Over the last 200 years we have had negative images of black people ... in literature by Rudyard Kipling to Agatha Christie. Tarzan showed that.

‘Racism came from the idea of race, which is a man-made construct. Race is not scientific or genetic. It does not actually exist. Race came about to validate and justify colonialism and slavery.’

He added: ‘There are examples everywhere. Rudyard Kipling, one of our greatest heroes, wrote The White Man’s Burden, in which he wrote it was incumbent on the Americans to go and civilise the savages in the Philippines.

‘Colonialism in Africa – Agatha Christie wrote a book called Ten Little N*****s. Would we accuse Agatha Christie of being racist? No, but that is passive racism.’

Barnes moved to England aged 13 in the late 1970s when his father was Jamaica’s military attaché to London. He is among England’s most-capped black players, but at Liverpool FC he was regularly subjected to racist abuse from spectators and infamously had a banana hurled at him during a Merseyside derby with Everton at Goodison Park.

The Commission for Racial Equality has called for the comic hero's adventure Tintin in the Congo to be banned

Twice married, Barnes has called for the National Curriculum to be revised so all children are taught that race is only a concept. He said: ‘If we get rid of passive racism then overcoming overt racism will take care of itself.’

Ross Dawson, a senior lecture in English at Liverpool John Moores University, denied Barnes had branded the authors as racists.

He said: ‘He identified the contemporary idea of race and racism as originating in the history of transatlantic slavery and colonialism. These were three writers which he used as examples of popular national literature which reproduced these racial assumptions.

‘His reference to passive racism was an attempt to show how we all have assumptions about race... without really understanding where those assumptions come from.’

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘The curriculum could do with being more explicit on this issue. A key role of education is to foster respect and understanding.’

Last year, one of Tintin’s classic adventures was banished to the adult shelves of bookshops because it was deemed overtly racist. Tintin In The Congo was given warning labels by many retailers over fears it could negatively affect children.

Rudyard Kipling’s reputation has come under attack over recent years with some critics branding him a ‘racist’ and a propagandist for the elite.

One of Kipling's most controversial poems The White Man's Burden, published in 1899, is often cited as revealing Kipling’s contempt for the colonised people, it begins:

Take up the White Man's burden,Send forth the best ye breed,Go, bind your sons to exile,To serve your captives' need;To wait, in heavy harness,On fluttered folk and wild,Your new-caught sullen peoples,Half devil and half child.

The poem was originally written for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, but exchanged for ‘Recessional’; Kipling changed the text of ‘Burden’ to reflect the subject of American colonization of the Philippines, recently won from Spain in the Spanish-American War.

Some scholars of the Nobel Prize winner, who was born of English parents in Bombay in 1865, at the height of the Raj, have advanced the view that Kipling used the poem to imply that white people have an obligation to subjugate other 'lesser' people.

Other students of the poem have said it alludes to the philanthropic view, common in Kipling's formative years, that the rich have a moral duty and obligation to help ‘the poor’ ‘better’ themselves whether the poor want the help or not.
