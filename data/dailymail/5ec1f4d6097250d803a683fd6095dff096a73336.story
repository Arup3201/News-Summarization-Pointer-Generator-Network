A family has been ordered to tear down a children's playhouse by council chiefs, because it does not have planning permission.

Edinburgh City Council officers have decided that the 8ft stilted structure - built to look like a treehouse - 'invades the privacy of neighbours' after they were tipped off that it did not have permission.

Karl Winkler, 50, built the house for his children Beatrice,11, Boris, nine and Claude, five,  to spend their summers at the home in Viewforth, Edinburgh.

But despite applying for retrospective planning permission, the family were turned down, and are now launching their fourth appeal to keep the building.

They have been appointed an independent adjudicator by the Scottish government, who could override the council's decision not to allow the Winklers to keep the structure.

Mr Winkler, a project manager, said Edinburgh City Council officers were tipped off by a neighbour.

He said: 'If someone builds something that’s really ugly, the rules allow you to do something about it.'But this is a kiddies’ playhouse - the council are using the regulations in the wrong way.

'There’s a small balcony the kids use in the summer which the council said invades the neighbours’ privacy, even though it faces away from them.'

The wooden structure, which cost £1,000 in materials to build, has been deemed 'too close' to the edge of the garden for its height, invading nearby residents’ privacy.

But Mr Winkler said none of his neighbours - who he said had been supportive of the treehouse - had made any complaints.

He said: 'There’s a small balcony the kids use in the summer which the council said invades the neighbours’ privacy, even though it faces away from them.

'I hold my hands up and admit it does breach the planning rules but to me the council are being unreasonable and heavy handed about this.

'What they are doing is procedurally correct, but not morally correct.

'The kids are going to be really upset if it has got to get pulled down.

'I could maybe take the stilts off, but it defeats the purpose of it being a treehouse.'

A decision on whether to allow the Winklers to keep the treehouse will be made by the Scottish government’s Directorate of Planning and Environment.

Mr Winkler and wife Sarah have now enlisted the help of demolition experts to see if the structure can be moved from the edge of the garden in a last-ditch attempt to save it from the chop.

A council spokeswoman said: 'The planning application was refused on the grounds it is inappropriate in a built-up area, causing issues with privacy for neighbouring gardens.

'This was then considered by the local review body, enforcement notice has been served and an appeal lodged with the Scottish Government.'

In 2012, Harry Potter author JK Rowling won a battle to build two Hogwarts-style tree houses in the garden of her Cramond home, despite protests from residents who said they would blight the appearance of the surrounding conservation area.

The writer had applied to have the massive structures, estimated to cost £250,000, erected as part of a programme of renovations at her home.
