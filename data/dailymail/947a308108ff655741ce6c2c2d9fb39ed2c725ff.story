Sick: Humberto Salvador, 36, is on trial for allegedly raping a woman because she was a lesbian

A man who allegedly raped a woman for being a lesbian uttered, 'you like men now, don't you?' as he assaulted her, she has claimed.

The 33-year-old victim, who has not been identified, wiped away tears as she testified about the brutal 2008 gang-rape during the trial of Humberto Salvador, 36, in Contra Costa County, California on Tuesday.

She recounted the terrifying moment she was robbed, forced to strip naked, carjacked and passed between three men - an attack prosecutors claim stemmed from her sexuality.

'You like men now, don't you? Tell me you like men,' Salvador uttered after he started attacking her, the woman said.

She explained that she screamed 'yes' as she feared for her life.

Salvador has been charged with 15 felonies including kidnapping, carjacking and gang rape in the December 13, 2008 attack, the Contra Costa Times reported. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

He was allegedly joined that night by fellow gang members Josue Gonzalez - the only one not accused of sexual assault - and then-teenagers Darrell Hodges and Robert Ortiz.

Targeted: He and three other men approached her on her street in Richmond, California (pictured), where he allegedly robbed her, smashed her over the head with a flashlight and made her strip naked

Defense lawyers have said that, while 
there is no doubt that the rape occurred, they are seeking to prove that
 it was not motivated by the woman's sexual orientation.

In court, the victim described how she arrived home in Richmond from her job at a pizzeria around 9.30pm when she was approached by a man, who demanded her purse and keys.

Photos of the woman's car show it was 
marked with emblems of her sexuality, including rainbow stickers 
symbolizing gay pride and a rainbow-colored teddy bear on the dashboard.

She said that the man, identified as 
Salvador, then smashed her across the head with a flashlight and showed 
the jury the scar that is still visible beneath her short hair.

As jurors wiped away their tears, the woman testified that the man forced her to strip naked on the sidewalk.

'He kept insisting and asking whether or not I liked men,' she said through a Spanish interpreter, adding: 'I thought he would kill me.'

He proceeded to rape her until the other men warned that people might be coming. They got into her car where Salvador continued to assault her, she said.

They drove to an abandoned apartment building near the Richmond BART and after he was done, he turned to the other men and told them it was their turn, the victim said.

Hodges and Ortiz participated in order to prove themselves to the street gang Salvador belonged to, the prosecutor said.

After the attack, the victim testified
 that she was left naked in a carport and waited until they were gone before running to the closest house with a light on. The residents called 911.

The prosecutor said Salvador's semen was recovered from the victim's body and his palm print was found in the victim's blood on the flashlight.

Grim: They drove her to a lot near the Richmond BART (pictured) where they passed her around and abused her before leaving her naked and bleeding. She ran to a nearby home for help

Gonzalez, 26, who is the only person not to have personally assaulted the victim, pleaded guilty to carjacking and robbery, and is expected to be sentenced after he testifies at Salvador's trial.

Hodges, 20, pleaded guilty to forcible oral copulation in concert and was sentenced on Tuesday to 24 years in prison. Ortiz, 20, is awaiting trial.

Both Ortiz and Hodges were charged as adults in the case despite being teenagers at the time.

The trial continues.
