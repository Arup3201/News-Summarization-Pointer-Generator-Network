Luke Shaw may be Britain’s most expensive defender, but he isn’t au fait with one of the country’s most iconic centre-halves.

According to Shaw’s former England international team-mate Frank Lampard, the £27million Manchester United defender came unstuck when quizzed about Arsenal and England legend Tony Adams.

Adams is one of England’s most decorated defenders, captaining the Gunners from the age of 21 and then his country later in his career.

He won four Premier League titles, becoming the only player in English football history to have captained a title-winning team in three different decades, and was capped 66 times by the Three Lions.

But Lampard claims Shaw, 19, wasn’t up to speed with the legendary defender when he came up in conversation at last summer's World Cup.

‘I was having a chat with Luke Shaw and I mentioned Tony Adams and he didn’t seem to know who I was talking about,’ Lampard, who retired from international football last month, told The Sun.

‘I said: “Are you winding me up?” And he said: “Who did he play for?” I knew then then it was time to retire.’
