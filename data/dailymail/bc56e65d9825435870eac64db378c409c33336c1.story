An entire troop of bunga bunga girls have been placed under investigation for perjury for lying at Silvio Berlusconi’s sex trial.

Judges say 30 witnesses gave false testimony to the court during the former Italian premier’s trial for sex with an underage prostitute and corruption.

Half of those accused of lying in Berlusconi’s defence are the starlets and showgirls who attended his infamous bunga bunga parties.

Verdict: Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi, pictured left last year, was found guilty of paying 
Karima El Mahroug, nicknamed Ruby the heart-stealer, pictured right, for
sex at a 'bunga bunga' party

The former Italian premier was yesterday handed a seven year jail sentence for paying for sex with exotic dancer Ruby the Heartstealer when she was just 17.

He then used his power to cover it up, the Milan court ruled, securing the release of Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug, from police custody by claiming that she was the niece of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

Over a two year trial a parade of dancers, models and reality TV stars who had attended the dinners at Berlusconi’s mansion gave evidence for the defence.

Showgirl Barbara Faggioli testified that she never saw ‘hard’ scenes or touching between the ex-premier and his female guests.

After
dinner at the lavish parties, which took place at Berlusconi’s opulent 
Palazzo Grazioli in Rome and one of his villas outside Milan, the 
one-time cruise ship crooner ‘would often sing’, she said ‘and tell 
anecdotes, sometimes political gossip.’

Aspiring model: Maria Esther Garcia Polanco, pictured when she was winner of Miss 
Roberta 2007, told the court that the bunga bunga parties were no more than 'innocent fun'

Garcia Polanco, a Dominican singer and model, who released a song 
called 'bunga bunga' told the court that the sordid sexcapades 
chronicled by the international media were no more than ‘elegant 
dinners’ and ‘innocent fun’.

But
this version of events contrasted wildly with that of the prosecutors, 
who said Ruby was ‘part of a prostitution ring set up for the personal 
sexual satisfaction of the defendant.’

In a wiretapped conversation one guest invited to a dinner told a friend that Berlusconi’s mansion was a ‘whorehouse,’ the prosecution said.

After attending a party at Arcore she told a friend: ‘It’s unbelievable, you have no idea,’ she said. ‘You can’t begin to imagine what goes on there. You’re either ready to do anything or you take a taxi and leave’.

A number of the girls allegedly remain on Berlusconi’s payroll, receiving Euro 2500 a month as well as grace and favour apartments in residential buildings he owns in Milan. 

Witnesses: Showgirl Barbara Faggioli, pictured left, claimed she never saw any touching between Berlusconi and his female guests. Parliamentarian Maria Rosario Rossi, pictured right, an MP in Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, is also being investigated over her evidence given in court

But the billionaire politician says he only supports the girls because their careers and reputations have been ruined by their association with him.

Among the other witnesses facing prosecution are Parliamentarian Maria Rosario Rossi, an MP in Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, and singer Mariano Apicella who recorded an album of Neapolitan songs with Berlusconi in 2003.

The testimony of all 30 witnesses has now been passed to prosecutors who will investigate whether they should be formally charged with perjury.

Berlusconi denies all charges, which he says are part of a left conspiracy against him among the judiciary. After the verdict he said: ‘This is a violent sentence. I will resist the persecution.’

Protests by supporters of his centre right party against the sentence were planned tonight in Rome.
