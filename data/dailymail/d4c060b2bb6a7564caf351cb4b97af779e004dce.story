A disabled woman has been barred from taking her five-year-old son into a McDonald's drive-through on her mobility scooter. 

Tina Cougill had carried her son Simon on her lap as she used the drive-through at the restaurant in Keighley, West Yorkshire, because she was too unwell to walk into the outlet.

But she has been left 'disgusted' after staff banned her from using the take-away pick-up facility in the same way again - despite claiming she had done so on 'several occasions' in the past.

McDonald's have confirmed that mobility scooters designed for road use, like Mrs Cougill's, are allowed to use their drive-through lanes.  

The only reason a person would not be allowed is if they were carrying another passenger.

But the 48-year-old mother, who lives in Keighley, has been left outraged.

'I am absolutely disgusted by this whole situation,' she said.

'I only went there because Simon wanted McDonald's and now we are unable to go. I now feel I am being discriminated against because I'm disabled.'

Mrs Cougill, who only has one lung, confirmed that Simon, pictured, had been with her on the scooter while going through the drive-through in Keighley, West Yorkshire

Mrs Cougill, who only has one lung, confirmed that Simon had been with her on the scooter while going through the drive-through.

She said: 'I used to park up and take Simon inside, because I am sometimes able to walk with a walking stick, depending on my health, but this particular restaurant is not accessible for my mobility scooter.

'I have also used the drive-through with Simon on several occasions without any member of staff saying a word. 

'They have even joked with me about being the first to use the lane on a mobility scooter. 

'There are no signs or anything to tell you this is an actually rule.'

Mrs Cougill was told that carrying a passenger broke the restaurant's 'health and safety' guidelines but she is now challenging the fast food chain's stance on the matter.

She added: 'My son is five-years-old and they are telling me that it is unsafe for him to sit on my knee in the drive-through. 

'I am not going to just leave him at the front of the restaurant on his own or have him walk around the drive-through as there are cars around.

'These sorts of situations make it difficult for disabled people with children. We are not going to put our kids in danger by leaving them or having them walk in a lane designed for cars. 

'It is far more dangerous than having him on my knee.

'If other drivers use the lane properly, which they have done in the past, me and Simon are safe on the mobility scooter.'

A spokesman for McDonald's said safety was a 'top priority' for the company and that mobility scooters designed for road use are allowed to use the drive-through

A spokesperson for McDonald's said: 'Our Drive-thru lanes are suitable for safe use by cars, vans, motorbikes, mopeds, and mobility scooters designed for road use.

'On this occasion, while the mobility scooter in question was designed for road use, we understand that the driver of the mobility scooter also had a child on her lap.

'Safety is a top priority and for this reason the restaurant team advised that we would be unable to serve this customer again in the Drive-thru, if they were carrying an extra passenger.'
