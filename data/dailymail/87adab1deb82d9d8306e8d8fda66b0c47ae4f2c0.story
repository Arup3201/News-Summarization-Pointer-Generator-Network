A 23-year-old woman who was stabbed to death multiple times on her way home from work knew her alleged killer, police say. 

The man accused of killing Shandee Blackburn in Mackay, north of Brisbane, in February last year was arrested on Thursday after an 18-month police investigation.

John Peros, 32, appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday to face charges of murder and robbery with wounding.

Peros wore a green prison-issue sweater and brown tracksuit pants as Magistrate Noel Nunan ordered he be remanded in custody until his next appearance.

He was arrested and charged after new evidence came to light during coercive hearings held by state's Crime and Corruption Commission over the past six months.

Police said Peros was known to Ms Blackburn and information from residents had been vital to the investigation.

Ms Blackburn was stabbed and had her handbag stolen as she walked home from the Harrup Country Club where she worked in the earlier hours of February 9, 2013.

The waitress was only 150 metres from her home when she was attacked.

Outside the court on Friday, Ms Blackburn's mother Vicki said it was important to be there for her daughter, but said it was hard to see her accused killer.

'I just felt sick, just felt sick,' she said.

But Ms Blackburn said it was a relief to finally have a sense that justice was being served.

'I think tonight will be the first time I can go to bed and feel some peace,' she said.

Ms Blackburn's older sister Shannah said the ordeal had been extremely hard on their family.

'For us we still know there's such a long road to go. But to get to this point, it's a first step on this long road. It's a step in the right direction,' she said.

Outside court, Peros's lawyer bristled when asked about details of the police brief against his client.

'How the f*** would I know,' Mr Bale said.

He had a similar reaction when asked by a journalist about where Peros was arrested.

'I'm not telling you that either, f*** off,' he said.

Mr Bale did say his client was doing reasonably well in the circumstances and had given him instructions to contest all of the charges.

'When the time comes the matter will be litigated in a court, not in the media, thanks.'

The case against Peros is due for mention in the Mackay Magistrates Court on October 9.
