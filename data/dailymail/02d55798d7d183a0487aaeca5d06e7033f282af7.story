Her husband has never been afraid of voicing his concerns over the issues of the day.

Now it appears that the Duchess of Cornwall may be following in Prince Charles’s footsteps by taking a more political approach to her role.

Camilla held a private meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has been campaigning on payday loan firms.

The Duchess of Cornwall met with Most Reverend Justin Welby at Clarence House, London, to discuss payday loan firms

The Duchess is a supporter of the idea of local credit unions, non-profit organisations that lend out members’ savings and encourage customers only to borrow amounts they can repay.

The Archbishop, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, sees these institutions as the way to challenge the stranglehold of companies such as Wonga by offering a more ethical and less punishing alternative for people desperate for a loan.

He was invited to Camilla’s London residence, Clarence House, on Friday for a meeting about his campaign against companies that charge exorbitant rates of interest on their loans.

A spokesman for the Duchess said: ‘We are not in a position to confirm what was discussed in a private conservation between the Duchess and the Archbishop of Canterbury.’

Camilla, 66, joined the London Mutual Credit Union, in Peckham, London, in May. 

She said at the time that she wanted ‘to highlight the practical help that credit unions offer their communities in these difficult times’.
