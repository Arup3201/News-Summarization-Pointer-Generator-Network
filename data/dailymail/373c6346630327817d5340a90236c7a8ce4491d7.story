A 15-year-old is pain free and walking after sacrificing her leg, to save her life.

Kelsey Buckley from Seacroft in Leeds, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011.

After doctors removed part of her leg, replacing the bone with a metal prosthesis, the teenager was plagued by infections.

Kelsey was given a choice as medics revealed she had the option to have her leg amputated, or risk losing her life.

Kelsey Buckley opted to have her left leg amputated at the thigh, left after doctors warned her she could die after being diagnosed with bone cancer. She is now pain free and learning to walk with a prosthesis, right

Refusing to dwell on her situation, the teen is now pain free and has started walking with a prosthesis.

She said: 'I was heartbroken to hear doctors say "lose your leg or your life.’

'But after everything I had been through it was an easy decision to make.

'I’m finally pain free and can start living my life again.'

Kelsey was first diagnosed with osteosarcoma, bone cancer, in 2011 after she noticing a lump on her leg.

In 2012, at just 12 years old she underwent chemotherapy, before having her tibia removed and replaced with a metal prosthesis at Birmingham Orthepaedic Hospital.

But her leg often became infected - leaving her in excruciating pain.

Medics eventually told Kelsey, an amputation was the only way to solve the problem.

Kelsey’s mother, Kim, 41, said: 'She is amazing, despite being so young she has dealt with it all so well.

'She smiled through gruelling rounds of chemotherapy.

'It was horrific watching my little girl in so much pain due to infections. Throughout it all she was so brave.

'I’d say, "Kelsey, don’t die" and she’d reply "I won’t leave you".

'She’d say "what are you crying for, it’s only cancer".'

After
 watching her daughter go through so much pain, Kim said it was a 
‘relief’ to be told by doctors that she needed an amputation.

After rounds of chemotherapy doctors removed Kelsey's tibia, replacing it with a metal prosthesis. But the teenager suffered multiple infections leading doctors to conclude amputation was the only option

Kelsey made the brave decision to have the amputation and underwent the operation last summer- and the teen hasn’t looked back since.

She said: 'Once my infected leg had gone I could finally get on with my life.

'I don’t let anything get me down for too long. I got up and out of bed just a few hours after surgery.

'i have my whole life to look forward too.'

Kelsey’s strength to beat cancer has not only come from her mother and four other siblings but her twin sister, Kara, too.

Kara said: 'My sister is my inspiration, we are so close so when she was going through cancer it was so hard.

'It’s amazing how happy she has been through her whole cancer journey, we are all so pleased she’s finally able to start enjoying life again.'

Kelsey is now able to enjoy swimming and would love to try ice skating.

She said: 'I don’t use my false leg as I prefer to just get around on my crutches.

'I’ve gone back to school full time too, my friends have been really supportive which helps massively.'

Ms Buckley added: 'Since the amputation Kelsey has regained her appetite after her weight plummeted, I’m so proud.

'We are so lucky to be referred so quickly by our GP, sometimes people don’t get diagnosed until after six months.

'At that point it’s much harder to cure.'

Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive officer said: 'One can only imagine the terror and disbelief which went through Kelsey’s mind when doctors told her “your leg or your life”.

'Primary bone cancer is a cruel and degrading disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year.

'Only half of these will survive and those who do are left with long-lasting physical and emotional scars.

'Kelsey has shown incredible bravery and maturity in dealing with her diagnosis and adapting to her new life. She is an inspiration to us all and we wish her and her family the very best.

'Primary bone cancer is the third biggest cancer killer in children and young adults, and yet survival rates haven’t improved in over 25 years.

'It’s only through research and awareness that we can change these devastating statistics to help people like Kelsey - today and tomorrow.

'Bone Cancer Research Trust fights to improve outcomes for primary bone cancer patients through research, awareness, information and support.'
