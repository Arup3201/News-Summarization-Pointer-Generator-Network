A spy plane equipped with a thermal imaging camera has flushed out hundreds of migrants living illegally in sheds and garages.

Slough borough council spent £24,000 on flights to build up a  precise 3D map of every building in the Berkshire town.

The plane criss-crossed streets, picking up heat signals from outbuildings which could signify they are being used as ‘sheds with beds’.

An analysis of a small part of the two-hour flyover identified 210  suspicious dwellings.

Illegal: Slough Council hopes to crackdown on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal living accommodation, such as this conversion, pictured

The council now estimates that between 300 and 3,000 people are living illegally in the town.

Anyone caught living illegally in 
outbuildings faces eviction and their landlords hefty fines. Many 
tenants pay as much as £100 a week to live in primitive conditions with 
no water or heating.

The council commissioned geographic imaging company Bluesky International to produce a thermal map of the town, which officers will use to pin-point warm areas in outbuildings.

An analysis of a small part of the two-hour flyover identified 210 suspected illegal dwellings.

Over the next few weeks officials 
will issue penalty notices, similar to parking tickets, to landlords 
with so-called beds in sheds, levying fines of £200 for each day that 
tenants remain.

In extreme cases the sheds will be demolished.

Ray Haslam, head of environmental 
services and resilience for Slough Borough Council, said: 'Our primary 
concern is making sure people aren’t living in unsafe conditions, with 
little or no heating, or in places that do not comply with building or 
fire safety regulations.

'Aerial photography is one of a range of tactics we’re using to crack down on this problem and we hope evidence of heat in outbuildings will help us build a true picture of how many sheds are being lived in and where they are.

'Some of these buildings are perfectly 
habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action to amend 
their use or have them removed.'

'We will be able to cross-check and see whether they have valid Energy Performance Certificates which are required by law for places where people live.

'If they don’t, we will be speaking to landlords and offering some advice and guidance, and enforcing the law if we need to.

'One option is to repeatedly fine a landlord for not having an EPC. The fine is £200 a day, making it very expensive for people to continue using the outbuilding.'

Cllr James Swindlehurst, deputy leader and commissioner for neighbourhoods and renewal, said: 'The people living in them generate waste, they use council services and they have a cost to the council that isn’t being paid for by taxation.

Growing problem: Slough Council estimates there are up to 3,000 'beds in sheds' in the Berkshire town. It has been granted extra Government funding to help improve the condition of houses in multiple occupancy

Cut backs: Slough Council says people living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them

Some of the buildings uncovered may be allowed to remain a dwelling but others will be demolished

'It causes pressure on parking and driveways and we get neighbourhood complaints about densely built gardens.

'Some of these buildings are perfectly habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action to amend their use or have them removed.'

Slough Borough Council is one of a handful of local authorities who have been granted extra money from the Government to help improve conditions in houses of multi occupancy and reduce the number of sheds being used as accommodation without permission.

The occupants of sheds in Slough are believed to be mostly single adults or childless couples with low incomes.

Long-term, it is hoped, the thermal imaging data will also used to improve energy efficiency in homes across the borough.

Last August it was announced that 
Slough council had been given more than £200,000 to tackle rogue 
landlords who house people in converted sub-standard outbuildings.

Last
 year it was announced that Slough Borough Council had been selected by 
government housing minister Grant Shapps in May for funding to 'flush 
out dodgy landlords' who are 'trapping vulnerable people' in converted 
sheds.

The council is 
targeting key problem wards including Baylis and Stoke, Central and 
Chalvey and has employed an additional planning enforcement officer, a 
barrister to pursue legal action and has taken on a part-time 
administrator to co-ordinate and liaise with officers across five 
council departments.

Mr
 Shapps said last year: 'I'm determined to flush out criminal landlords 
who think they can make an easy buck from cramped, cockroach-ridden 
outhouses. The scandal of 'beds in sheds' must come to an end.'
