A girl with a facial birthmark the size of a grapefruit has been cured thanks to a new drug treatment.

Jessica Leng, four, developed a pea-sized lump on the left side of her face shortly after she was born.

The mass continued to grow steadily over the next three months until it was almost the same size as her head - prompting her worried parents to fear she had a deadly tumour.

Jessica Leng (pictured at her christening) was born with a small lump on her face. It grew rapidly and by the time she was three-months-old, it was the size of a grapefruit

But, following an MRI scan, doctors discovered that the swelling was actually a parotid haemangioma, a large collection of blood vessels which had built up under Jessica’s skin.

Her mother, Donna Payne, agreed to allow her daughter to take part in a medical trial in which she was prescribed propranolol, a type of beta blocker which is usually used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions in adults.

Incredibly, Jessica’s birthmark has all but disappeared, leaving just a tiny bit of excess skin around her ear.

Miss Payne, 35, said: ‘Propranolol really is a wonder drug.

‘It isn’t usually used to treat birthmarks, but Jessica was part of a trial and it has been a huge success.

‘To look at her, you’d never guess she’d once had a huge lump on the side of her face.

Jessica's mother, Donna Payne, 35, initially feared that the growth was a tumour. She also worried that Jessica would be bullied at school and that the growth might be causing her pain

Jessica was treated with propranolol, a beta blocker that is usually used to treat anxiety, high blood pressure and heart disease in adults. After two years of treatment, the growth has completely disappeared

‘I worried she’d be bullied at school but now you can hardly tell there was ever anything wrong.’

Miss Payne, a nurse from Scarborough, Yorkshire, first noticed a small lump on Jessica’s face when her little girl was just two-weeks-old.

Concerned, she consulted her midwife, who reassured her it was a benign birthmark and was nothing to worry about.

But soon the lump had swelled alarmingly to the size of a golf ball and had become hot and pulsating.

Since her treatment, Jessica has been left with nothing other than a little bit of excess skin around her ear

Miss Payne said: ‘It was like Jessica was growing a second head. The birthmark seemed to be growing overnight.

‘It had made her mouth and eye droop. When we had her christened at three-months-old, it was the size of a grapefruit.

‘It looked agonising. The skin around it had started to split. It was dry, cracked, red and oozing pus. I worried that it would never stop growing.

‘What’s worse, she was struggling to feed. Sometimes she couldn’t swallow and she’d stop breathing.

‘It was terrifying and I was scared it was all because of the huge lump on her face.’

Jessica was rushed to Scarborough Hospital at four-months-old after she went limp during a feed.

She was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where doctors carried out tests.

Miss Payne said: 'Propranolol really is a wonder drug. It isn't usually used to treat birthmarks, but Jessica was part of a trial and it has been a huge success'

Here, it was confirmed she had gag reflex problems, explaining her difficulty breathing.

However, a consultant reassured Miss Payne and Jessica’s father, Andy Leng, that the lump on her face was unrelated and wasn’t causing Jessica any pain.

Miss Payne said: ‘We were relieved when the doctors said it was a birthmark and couldn’t hurt Jessica.

Miss Payne said she worried that the lump would never stop growing but a doctor reassured her that it would not cause Jessica serious medical problems

‘It had been blocking her ear, which had caused some hearing problems, but it wasn’t expected to have any long-term effects.

‘They assured us that it was stop growing eventually, but it seemed to be getting bigger, not smaller.’

Haemangiomas, often known as strawberry birthmarks, are usually treated using steroids, with varying degrees of success.

But doctors instead suggested they treat Jessica with a course of propranolol in a bid to stem the blood flow through her birthmark.

The drug is usually used to treat patients with thyroid problems and heart disease, but is currently being trialled on children with similar types of birthmark to Jessica.

Miss Payne was delighted when she noticed that the birthmark had begun to shrink almost immediately.

After two years of medication, Jessica recently stopped taking propranolol when her birthmark disappeared almost completely.

Although Miss Payne was warned the lump may reappear, Jessica has shown no signs of a relapse.

Miss Payne said: ‘I have told Jessica about her birthmark and shown her photos of her as a little girl, just so she knows what she’s been through.

‘She takes it all in her stride though. Sometimes at dinner, she makes me laugh by pushing her food to one side of her mouth and pretending the lump has returned.

The growth was blocking Jessica's ear causing her to have some hearing problems. Now that it has gone, her hearing is expected to return to normal

‘If she wants to have the excess skin around her ear removed when she’s older, I’ll support her.

‘But she’s been through so much, I’m just happy she’s smiling.’

Propranolol works by blocking the release of noradrenaline in certain parts of the body.

When she is older, Jessica (pictured with her mother Donna, left, and grandmother, Daryl, centre) will be able to decide whether or not to have the excess skin around her ear removed

Noradrenaline is a chemical released by nerves when they are stimulated. The noradrenaline passes messages to other parts of the body, such as the muscles, blood vessels and heart.

It is thought that propranolol helps narrow the blood vessels, reducing the amount of blood running through them. This reduces the colour and makes them softer.

The cells that cause the growth of the haemangioma are also affected so the haemangioma gets smaller.

As a result, birthmarks which are made up of a collection of blood vessels become less pronounced.
