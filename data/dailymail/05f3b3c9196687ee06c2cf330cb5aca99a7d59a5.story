With a £26million fortune, Robin Gibb left behind more than enough to ensure his widow and three children would be well provided for.

However, it may be a different story for the late singer’s love child – who has been cut out of his inheritance altogether, the Daily Mail can reveal. 

The former Bee Gee died in May last year aged 62 after a long battle with colon and liver cancer. He was survived by his second wife Dwina, 60, their son Robin-John, 30, and his two children from his first marriage, Spencer, 41, and Melissa, 39.

Gibb also left four-year-old daughter Snow Robin, who he fathered with his live-in housekeeper Claire Yang, then 33, in 2008.

But newly released details of Gibb’s will show the youngster will not inherit any of his estate.

The revelation follows reports of a feud between Mrs Gibb and Miss Yang.

Although the singer and his partner of 35 years had an open marriage, Mrs Gibb reportedly stopped Snow and her mother from attending his funeral last year.

Valued at £25.8million after tax, Gibb’s fortune includes all of his UK assets but does not include his properties in America or assets already shared jointly with his wife.

The money has been placed in a trust fund, with Mrs Gibb receiving all profits until her death.

The self-described Celtic druidess has also been granted all of her husband’s ‘personal chattels’ and the lucrative music rights to his share of the royalties from the Bee Gees’ back catalogue, which includes hits such as Stayin’ Alive and How Deep Is Your Love.

Spencer and Melissa will each be given £500,000 immediately, with the remainder of the estate to be split between them and Robin-John upon Mrs Gibb’s death.

Miss Yang has been allowed to keep the £850,000 house Gibb bought her in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, but her daughter did not inherit anything from the will. 

The 15-page document was drawn up in August 2011, nine months before Gibb’s death, and was witnessed by his personal assistant and his chauffeur.

In the final paragraph, Gibb stated that he was ‘in the process of making reasonable financial provision for Snow’.

He asked his trustees to provide for her should he fail to do so before he died, but made no specific provision in his will.

There were unconfirmed reports Gibb gave Miss Yang £5million before he died. But she refused to comment on the will or financial arrangements when she was approached at her home yesterday.

News of Gibb’s affair with Miss Yang emerged only in February 2009 – three months after Snow was born at the private Portland Hospital in West London.

It reportedly took a year for Gibb’s lawyers to agree a financial settlement with her for Snow’s future education and maintenance. 

The pair are thought to have been involved romantically for some years before the child’s birth.

Miss Yang started out as the couple’s housekeeper, working at their 12th century mansion in Thame, Oxfordshire, and at their £2.6million waterfront beach house in Miami, Florida.

Following Snow’s birth, Gibb said: ‘New life is heaven sent and a blessing. That’s what I can say about children and life.’ 

Despite the affair, Mrs Gibb insisted she and her husband had a happy relationship.

Earlier this year, she said: ‘It’s very important that people who are creative are given the freedom to create in a marriage. It’s not good to have jealousies around. 

‘Some people even get jealous  of someone reading a book and not paying attention to them.  We were both creative and there was a lot of trust.’ 

She added: ‘Let’s just say Robin made sure everyone in his life was taken care of. They’ve been sufficiently provided for – everyone has.’ 

Gibb’s total fortune was estimated at £93million last year, significantly more than the amount bequeathed in his will. It is believed most of the remainder is tied up in assets held overseas as well as those owned jointly with his wife.

Money held in joint bank accounts and all jointly owned homes pass directly to Mrs Gibb without being included in the will.

It is not known whether Miss Yang plans to contest the will. Under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975, any child is allowed to contest a will – or have it contested on their behalf – if they are excluded or if it is unfair.
