A jeweller with a childhood dream of seeing diamonds floating in the sky has fulfilled his wish after flying a £1million stone above London.  

Denis Bellessort, founder of Bonds of Union, was inspired after spending hours gazing at stars as a boy. 

To celebrate his company's fifth anniversary, the 53-year-old attached the gem to a remote-controlled hexacopter - a six-bladed mini helicopter - to fly above Holland Park in west London. 

The diamond let off a stunning beam of white light while being lit up as it flew above trees in Holland Park, west London on October 3 to celebrate Bonds of Union's fifth anniversary

Attached to the expert-controlled hexacopter, the £1million stone was lit up by a fixed light rig which showcased its beauty. Mr Bellessort said he had the idea from staring at stars as a child 

The 10-carat £1million diamond is among the exquisite jewels sold by Bond of Union in London. It was chosen for the flight as it reflected the best light

The 10-carat diamond was lit up by a fixed rig on the device, sending piercing beams of white light across the night sky. 

'The idea with the flying of a diamond was first for me a child dream while gazing at the stars and reminded with stories like the Little Prince and songs like Lucy in the sky with diamonds,' he said. 

'Now it is a great reason to deepen my understanding on how light affects diamonds at long distance and how I could play with lights and diamonds.' 

The jeweller now hopes to put on similar displays from the Eiffel Tower, over snow and at the in the desert to showcase the beauty of diamonds. 

'My theory was confirmed and the experience reveals the immense power of diamonds, a power that has never been seen before. 

'The quality of the light when filtered through a diamond and returned to people at floor level creates the finest light that any medium can create. 

'For me, the light with its pure white and colour flashes represent the highest level of beauty. It gives me the same joy as art but amplified.

The 53-year-old said the stunt helped him understand the stone's capabilities with reflecting light. He is pictured launching the diamond into the sky on October 3 

The brightness of the diamond is clearly visible as it lines up next to the moon. Mr Bellessort said he would now like to try the stunt at the Eiffel Tower and over snow 

'I have spent a few months studying and practising the most appropriate angles to get the light fully inside the diamond with a right balance of few reflections.

'For the first flight I wanted to show the inner beauty of diamonds.

'Once I had an effect similar to the northern lights in green colour and then in blue colour as I was walking towards the centre of the diamonds, far below. This is something I will also recreate later. 

'It is like walking in the sparks and brilliance of a diamond.'
