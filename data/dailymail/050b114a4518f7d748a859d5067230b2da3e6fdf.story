Jailed: Marquise Montgomery, 22, who had worked at Casa Del Mar, was arrested on Thursday after DNA evidence linked him to the crime

A California care home worker was arrested today after a DNA test revealed his alleged ties to the heinous rape of a disabled woman in his care.

Authorities in Placer County were alerted to the crime at the Casa Del Mar Care Facility in Penryn last year when the woman, who is blind and seriously handicapped, was found to be pregnant.

Investigators believed at the time that the woman, who was not identified, may have been sexually assaulted.

Fox 40 reported that Marquise Montgomery, 22, who had worked at Casa Del Mar, was arrested on Thursday after a key piece of DNA evidence linked him to the crime.

Montgomery had since left his job at the care facilty.

Montgomery's arrest was a year in the making, as authorities could not positively link 
Montgomery to the crime until they could obtain a DNA sample from the woman's child, who was born in April.

Once investigators had the sample, they tested it with DNA of workers at the care facility - and Montgomery was a match, according to Fox 40.

Police found Montgomery in Sacramento and charged him with rape. He is currently being held at the Placer County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail.

Montgomery is due back in court tomorrow.
