One of the twin schoolgirls who followed their jihadi brother from Manchester to Syria has revealed she still wants to be a doctor - but for Isis.

The 16-year-old has tweeted a slew of fanatical messages, reportedly including: 'I will become a doctor for Isis not for these pagans'.

Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them fled Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago and are now believed to be based in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold.

But despite widespread efforts to bring them back, social media updates suggest the pair are training to use grenades Kalashnikov rifles.

On a Twitter account believed to be controlled by either Salma or Zahra, messages mock media reports of their stellar school records, according to The Sun.

'Training to be doctors to Training to be killers... I will become a doctor for Isis not for these pagans', she tweets. 

It comes just days after it emerged Salma and Zahra Halane have allegedly married Isis fighters since relocating to Raqqa, Syria.

An expert in extremism has checked the social media accounts and they are thought to be genuine.

Shiraz Maher, an expert on radicalisation, told Newsnight last week: 'These women are saying they have chosen to go because they want to support fighters.

The sisters were hard-working students who hoped to train as doctors.

The pair achieved 28 GCSEs between them, but last month they left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border.

Police said the pair are thought to have followed their elder brother, who ditched his own ‘excellent’ academic career to join the ISIS terror group around a year ago.

Friends said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training for battle.

Last month a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16 how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two years said: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... they end up in Syria.’

The twins’ parents raised the alarm after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing.

A former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’.
