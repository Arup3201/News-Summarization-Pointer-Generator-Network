As it's recently been confirmed that Mollie King is back dating male model David Gandy, it's fair to say the singer has good taste.

Now the Saturday's star has partnered with Greek brand Folli Follie to showcase their autumn/winter collection of stylish accessories including statement bags and gold bangles. 

She told Grazia Daily: 'There are styles for every occasion and the vibrant hues are the perfect way to add a pop of colour to your outfit.'

Among the 27-year-old's favourite items are a 'Heat4Heart' grey handbag for £220.

She said: 'The quilted finish is super luxe and looks great in the warm grey. The detachable strap makes it’s really easy to wear.' 

She also loves the vibrant letterbox red Nomad Body Bag for £150.

She said: 'It's great for when I’m on the go. It's just the right size to fit all of the essentials.'

When it comes to jewellery, she said she loves to stack up multiple bangles on her wrist in different designs because 'mixing metals is a key trend this season'.

Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Mollie is back dating model David, 34, after they have been pictured together on a number of recent occasions.

Now he has alluded to their reconciliation in the Evening Standard Magazine and even hinted that they could get married.

Writer Laura Craik spotted that Mollie has her own labelled drawer in David's walk-in wardrobe whilst researching an article on his Fulham townhouse.

Oblivious to David's former relationship with Mollie, Laura quips: 'Wow. A lady with her own drawer in the house, someone book the church.' 

To which he replies: 'There you go. Even though she steals all my clothes.'

So it seems Folli Follie may soon have to start planning some bridal accessories for Mollie...
