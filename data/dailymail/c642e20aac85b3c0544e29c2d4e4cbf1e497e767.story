Jack Harper is a name that may well be cropping up weekly in the coming years. If you don't know him already, you soon will. 

The 18-year-old Scot is rapidly emerging as someone who could well have an impact on the Real Madrid sooner rather than later. 

Need convincing? Harper was at the hub of Real's youth 2-0 win against Basle on Tuesday - scoring once, hitting the bar, smacking a post and forcing the away goalkeeper into two stunning saves.

Remember the name of Jack Harper, the 18-year-old Scot starring for Real Madrid's youth team

The forward is all-action, his overhead kick to cannon off the woodwork bearing resemblance to a certain No 7 at the Bernabeu.

Any sort of comparison is premature at this stage, but Harper is going about things the right way. 

Born in February 1996, the youngster has been at the club since he was 13 and signed a long-term deal two years ago; he doesn't appear to be looking back.

Iker Casillas is said to have lent Harper a helping hand during his formative years at the Bernabeu 

His family - originally from Barrhead, East Renfrewshire - have lived in Spain for the best part of the last 18 years and Harper, to all intent and purpose, is a Spanish footballer. 

He has the poise and guile to cut in from wide and dictate play, running beyond the front man from deep, but with an eye for goal that sets him apart from other No 10s. 

Harper - who was spotted playing for a local side in Malaga, Los Boliches - has enjoyed a footballing education at one of Europe's more prestigious academies.

Gordon Strachan could be tempted to throw Harper into the deep end in Euro 2016 qualifying

It's now five years since Real comfortably beat off Sevilla for his signature - there was never any contest - and it's showing. All the indications are that Harper can become a star for club and country.

SFA performance director Mark Wotte has visited Madrid on numerous occasions to keep tabs on him, spending time at the Ciudad Real Madrid complex and keeping in contact with the youth chief Ramon Martinez.

Scotland have high hopes. If he continues to kick on, it may well be that Harper is thrown in at the Euro 2016 deep end.
