Conor McGregor raised the roof of the O2 Arena in Dublin as he stopped Diego Brandao in the first round on Saturday night.

The featherweight backed up his pre-fight boasts when he dropped the Brazilian with a left hand before completing the job on the canvas.

McGregor is now undefeated in three fights in the UFC having been out of action for almost a year after tearing ligaments in his knee against Max Holloway last August.

McGregor said: 'This is the feeling of success bursting through every vein in my body. I've been saying all week that I'd finish this guy in the first round - I seem to be predicting the future.

'I just felt comfortable - this is what I was put here to do. Something tells me that by the end of the year, I'll be world champion. I would turn over every man, woman and child to get that belt. And I want to fight again soon. I want to get straight back in there.'

In the co-main event, Gunnar Nelson maintained his unbeaten record after a patient display against Zak Cummings.

After a tactical opening five minutes, Nelson took the Texan down before executing the rare naked choke 12 seconds before the end of the second round.

The Icelander, who does the bulk of his training in Dublin, said: 'This was a tough fight. Zak is a very tough opponent. He is strong everywhere and he knows what he is doing.

The atmosphere out there was something else. I have never felt like that in the Octagon. The crowd was so loud and so intense - it is a different feeling. The title definitely is in my mind, but I want to take it a step at a time. Hopefully next time I fight, I'll be taking on a top contender.'

Brad Pickett's hopes of earning himself a title shot were dashed when he was beaten by Ian McCall. Pickett, in his second fight at flyweight, was outworked over three rounds.

The Londoner said: 'I am disappointed obviously. I am a very competitive person and I hate losing. I'm just disappointed with how the fight went. I thought I won the first round but I knew he won the last two because I just couldn't catch him.

'I was chasing more and more but I left myself open. I came down to flyweight for a reason - to get a title shot. Obviously that is out of the window now. The natural move for me now is to go back up a weight division again.'

McCall, meanwhile, immediately set his sights on a showdown with champion Demetrious Johnson.

He said: 'I was a little off - I wasn't aggressive enough. But it was an intelligent fight I think. I know Brad thinks I don't respect him as a fighter but I really do.

'He's a strong guy - he's fought a lot of people. Now, there is unfinished business with Demetrious Johnson - he has something that is mine.'

The main card opened with Norman Parke pounding Naoyuki Kotani to earn a stoppage victory in the second session.

The Dublin crowd were earlier treated to three home wins as Neil Serry, Cathal Pendred and Patrick Holohan impressed.
