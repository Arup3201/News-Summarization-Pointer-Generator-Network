A high-profile Ukip MEP has been expelled from the party after her chief of staff was filmed allegedly attempting to make fraudulent expense claims.

Ukip last night said Janice Atkinson and her assistant Christine Hewitt had been kicked out for ‘bringing the party into disrepute’.

A disciplinary hearing was held yesterday following allegations that Miss Hewitt had obtained a £3,150 invoice for a drinks party that cost £950 in a bid to ‘repatriate’ extra money from the EU.

Miss Atkinson, who is an MEP for the South East, had also been due to stand at the General Election as the candidate for the Folkestone and Hythe constituency.

Police last week launched an investigation into allegations over the women’s event hosted by Mrs Atkinson at Ukip’s spring conference in Margate, Kent.

Guests at the party, which was attended by Nigel Farage’s wife Kirsten, drank champagne, cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine.

The event reportedly cost £950 and was paid by Mrs Atkinson’ chief of staff Christine Hewitt on credit card, but she later returned to the restaurant and was given an invoice for £3,150.

Mr Farage said last week that he was 'deeply shocked' by the allegations and described it as 'one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life'

She was allegedly filmed telling an undercover reporter: ‘The idea is we overcharge them slightly because that’s the way of repatriating (the money).’

Nigel Farage was left reeling last week after losing three election candidates in less than 24 hours.

The Ukip leader was left 'deeply shocked' after suspending MEP Janice Atkinson.

Hours later the party confirmed a second senior figure, the party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, had been suspended following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'.

The final blow came when the party's candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Jonathan Stanley, sensationally quit claiming he was sick of the 'open racism and bullying' in the party.

Mr Farage last week said: ‘I was deeply shocked when I saw it. It was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life.’

The party yesterday held a disciplinary hearing chaired independently by somebody from the legal profession with representatives of the national executive of Ukip.

Last night in a statement, Mrs Atkinson said: 'I am deeply disappointed by today’s decision and fully intend to appeal.

‘I was elected to represent the constituents of the south-east of England and I will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf and for the best interests of our country.'

A Ukip spokesman said: ‘Janice Atkinson MEP and Christine Hewitt, assistant to Janice Atkinson, have been found to have brought the party into disrepute.

‘As a result they have been expelled from the UK Independence Party. They have 14 days to appeal.

‘This means that Ms Atkinson no longer represents UKIP in the European Parliament and she will no longer be our prospective parliamentary candidate for Folkestone and Hythe.’

Mrs Atkinson, pictured with Nigel Farage as the South East England region results of the European Parliament elections were declared last year, was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011

Mrs Atkinson was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011. The 52-year-old found herself in hot water last year after she was recorded by TV cameras calling the wife of a Ukip supporter ‘a ting tong from somewhere’.

She insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was ‘incredibly sorry’ for offending the woman.

In December it emerged that she owed more than £2,000 in child support to her ex-husband despite previously criticising ‘feckless families’ who have more children than they can afford.

She has also been pictured sticking up her middle finger stuck up to a camera and was accused of swearing at protesters.

Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.'

Immigrants causing traffic jams

Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'
