Though the young man was conscious when officers arrived, he died while he was being rushed to Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Darious A. Fitzpatrick, 17, has been charged with his death.

Following the tragedy, John Schnatter, the CEO and founder of Papa John's, traveled to Tennessee for Schaffer's funeral on Saturday, paying for not only the service but also all of his medical expenses.

'We never once imagined that this would touch anyone high up in the Papa John's corporate office, let alone, John Schnatter,' said Schaffer's sister, Devan Cronin. 

'He was visibly distraught when speaking to my family about the tragic loss of my brother and it was apparent that he didn't come just to pay lip service.'

The Tennessean reports that the young woman also added of Schnatter, 'his display of support was so much more meaningful than any monetary donation.'

Schnatter, who started Papa John's by using money he made after selling his car to purchase used pizza equipment he then set up in a broom closet at the local tavern owned by his father, is said to be worth $600 million.

Fitzpatrick meanwhile has reportedly admitted to shooting 22-year-old Schaffer and prosecutors are attempting to try him as a adult.

Schaffer's family has also raised  $9,000 on a GoFundMe page that will be used for the family to travel to Washington and scatter the young man's ashes in the Pacific Northwest.

At the time of his death Schaffer had been saving his money to move to Seattle.
