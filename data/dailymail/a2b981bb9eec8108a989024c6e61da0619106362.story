An Arkansas father who shot dead a 15-year-old who egged his car says he only fired at the car full of teens to scare them away from his property.

Adrian Broadway died Saturday after being hit in the head by 48-year-old Willie Noble's gun, which also left several holes in the passenger side of the car.

The teens in the car were reportedly in a prank war with a son of Noble, and vandalized one of Noble's cars by spreading leaves, eggs and mayonnaise on it.

Instead of calling police after finding his damaged car, Noble told investigators that he went inside to wait for the group to return.

'Mr Noble stated that once they returned (about 45 minutes later), he fired his handgun to scare them,' according to a statement released by police Tuesday.

Broadway was sitting in the front passenger seat when she was hit. After the shots, 18-year-old driver Dshone Nelson sped off and got as far as a Kum & Go gas station where they stopped to call 911.

Leaves, eggs and mayonnaise: This is the remnants of the prank that Adrian Broadway and her friends played on Willie Noble's car that allegedly ended up with him firing a gun

She was raced to Arkansas Children's Hospital but sadly died from her injuries.

Noble
 was arrested by police and charged with one count of first degree 
murder, one count of a terroristic act and five counts of aggravated 
assault - for firing on the other passengers of the white Hyundai 
Sonata. He is being held on $1million bond.

Lieutenant Sidney Allen said this was all the result of a prank that happened three months ago.

'Apparently Mr. Noble's teenage son had 
done a prank on some of the kids that were inside the vehicle on 
Halloween Night. As a result they were doing a retaliation prank and it 
ultimately had deadly results,' Allen explained.

In addition to Broadway and the 
18-year-old driver, one 17-year-old, four 15 year-old's, and on 
14-year-old were in the car at the time of the shooting.

Driver Dshone Nelson had minor lacerations to his hands from the broken glass.

According to witnesses, Noble came outside and fired on the car full of teens as they drove away.
