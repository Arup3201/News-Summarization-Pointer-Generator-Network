Homeless: Imprisoned OJ Simpson has lost his Miami home in a foreclosure auction after getting behind on more than two years of mortgage payments

OJ Simpson won't have a place to call home when he's eligible for parole in three years.

The former football star famous for his controversial acquittal in the 1994 murder of wife Nicole Brown Simpson, lost his Miami home on Tuesday in a private foreclosure auction. 

The 4,334-square-foot home with a swimming pool was sold for $655,000 to an as-yet-unidentified bidder, while 66-year-old Simpson is currently behind bars at a Nevada prison on a robbery conviction.

'He has been trying to do everything he can to win his release, and the idea was that he’d have a home to come back to,' Simpson's attorney Leonardo DaVinci Starke told the Miami Herald. 'We were hoping for the best, but it didn’t happen.'

That price was $100,000 more than what Simpson paid for the home when he purchased it in September 2000, fleeing California after losing a civil suit.

While Simpson was let off in the murder case of his wife and her friend Rob Goldman, he was ordered to pay Goldman's father Fred Goldman $33.5million in a judgement that found him liable for the waiter's death.

Simpson moved to Florida because homesteads in the state can't be seized to pay for civil judgements.

However, Simpson lost control of the home last year when he got behind on more than two years worth of mortgage payments. Simpson owes mortgage holder JP Morgan Chase more than $892,283 in back payments, principal fees, court costs and penalties.

Highest bidder: The 4,334-square-foot home with a swimming pool was sold in a Tuesday auction to an unnamed bidder for $655,000. That's $100,000 more than what Simpson paid for the property in 2000

And that's not the only problem on Simpson's plate.

His attorneys are currently fighting to get him an appeal in his 2008 robbery conviction.

Simpson was found guilty of working with a group of armed men to steal sports memorabilia at the Palace Station hotel on September 13, 2007.

He was originally sentenced to up to 33 years in prison, but his sentence was ultimately reduced last year when a judge granted parole on some of the charges.

His new defense team is currently working to get him freed sooner with an appeal arguing that his former lawyer Yale Galanter was biased, since he had prior knowledge of the robbery.

The appeal was submitted the Nevada Supreme Court on Wednesday, with his new defense team arguing that evidence at the trial 'tended to indicate that Galanter was involved in the alleged conspiracy.'

The gloves don't fit: Simpson was famously acquitted of the 1994 murder of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson. Above, a  picture of Simpson during the trial in June 1995 trying on a pair of bloodied gloves thought to have been used in the murder
