American and Iranian leaders tussled Monday afternoon after Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he rejected overtures from the United States to join its coalition aligned against the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). 

'The American ambassador in Iraq asked our ambassador [in Iraq] for a session to discuss coordinating a fight against Daesh,' Khamenei said, referring to ISIS by an alternate name in quotes carried by the state-controlled news service IRNA. 

'Our ambassador in Iraq reflected this to us, which was welcomed by some [Iranian] officials, but I was opposed. I saw no point in cooperating with a country whose hands are dirty and intentions murky.'

Iran has also claimed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif if his country would join the Obama administration's anti-ISIS coalition. 

In two press briefings hours later, Obama administration officials tried to swat the accusation away as they struggled to maintain that the U.S. has never intended to work with Iran in any way.

Noncommittal: White House Press secretary Josh Earnest dodged a question about whether there was a 'request from the United States for cooperation of any kind with the Iranians'

Asked if the United States had made any appeals to Tehran for help, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would only say, 'Certainly none that I'm aware of.'

A reporter asked Earnest to confirm that 'there has been no request from the United States for cooperation of any kind with the Iranians in this battle' against ISIS.

Earnest fell back on a policy statement. 'Our posture,' he said, 'is that we are not going to coordinate our military actions or our intelligence sharing activities with the Iranians.'

Citing a 'shared interest' of both Iran and the U.S. in defeating ISIS, he acknowledged that 'there will continue to be back-channel communications – back-channel conversation – on this topic between the United States, and other members of the international community, and the Iranians.' 

But despite 'Iran's significant military capability, and given their significant interest in the outcome' as ISIS mows through territory in neighboring Iraq, he insisted that the Obama administration is not 'going to coordinate with Iran.'

Earnest added that are no plans for President Obama and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, to talk when they are both in New York city for a United Nations General Assembly meeting in two weeks.

A few blocks away and an hour later at the State Department's headquarters, deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf framed her initial response as a hypothetical.

'I'm not confirming one way or the other any reports of contact' between the two nations, she said.

'We are not going to cooperate' with Iran, Harf added, 'so obviously that would follow that we haven't asked them to.'

One reporter pressed her for a more definitive denial.

'Any contact you have had, or may have in the future, will not be an "ask" of Iran?' he clarified?

'Correct,' Harf said. 'Absolutely correct.'

But then, speaking only in the present tense, she said: 'We're certainly not discussing coordinating with them.'

Iran's military could be a fearsome weapon against ISIS, and Iran shares a common interest with the US since Iraq is on its western border 

'We are not going to cooperate' with Iran, State Dept. deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said vaguely, 'so obviously that would follow that we haven't asked them to'

State Dept. chief spokeswoman Jen Psaki tweeted on Monday that the US 'will not coordinate militarily with Iran,' but was silent on the question of whether the Obama administration had ask the Islamic republic to help

State Department chief spokeswoman Jen Psaki refused comment to CBS News about whether any approach was made. Earlier in the day, she tweeted a version of Harf's talking points, writing that 'we are not and will not coordinate militarily with Iran.'

Their boss, Secretary of State John Kerry, was in Paris on Monday for an international diplomatic conference aimed at resolving how to hamstring ISIS, which now controls more than one-third of the combined territories of Iraq and Syria.

A joint statement issued afterward described a collective aim of defeating ISIS and supporting Iraq 'by any means necessary, including appropriate military assistance.'

Representatives from Iran were not invited. 

Kerry, like the White House, was noncommittal but seemed intent on not slamming any doors in Rouhani's face.

'I have no idea of what interpretation they drew from any discussion that may or may not have taken place,' Kerry told Reuters. 'We are not coordinating with Iran. Period.'

Khamenei insisted Monday that he 'rejected' entreaties from Secretary of State John Kerry and from US Ambassador to Iraq Stuart Jones

But in his next breath he said he was not 'opposed to the idea of communicating to find out if they will come on board or under what circumstances or whether there is the possibility of a change.'

'Having a channel of communication on one of the biggest issues in the world today,' Kerry said, 'is common sense.'

Khamenei, Iran's 75-year-old religious patriarch, appeared less enthusiastic.

He had claimed earlier in the day, following his release from a hospital where he had what his government called a routine procedure on his prostate, that 'we are proud that the U.S. has become disappointed at Iran not having a part in a collective wrongdoing.'

'We do not work with the Americans, as they have evil intentions and stained hands,' he said. 'How is it possible to cooperate with Americans under such circumstances?'

Now they are lying,' Khamenei charged, 'in saying that it is them who excluded us from their coalition, while it was Iran that refused to participate in this coalition to begin with.'

He claimed the Obama administration wanted to regain in Iraq what it once had in Pakistan, 'a playground where they can enter freely and bomb at will.'
