Glamorous: 23-year-old Kate combines looking good with milking 500 cows three times a day

With her 
long blonde hair extensions, cut-off denim shorts and perfectly applied 
fake tan, Kate, 23, from Herefordshire, certainly isn't your average 
farmer.

But while she might look as though she spends her days in the beauty salon, work for the 23-year-old begins at 5am and doesn't stop until the sun goes down.

Her work includes milking 500 cows three times a day, overseeing calving and clearing the yard of muck, as well as feeding duties.

Despite the long hours and backbreaking work, Kate, who says her friends 'don't really understand' what she does, says she has no plans to ever do anything else.

'Dairy farming is a passion and it's 24 
hours a day,' she explains. 'I dream about cows in my sleep and then I wake up and think 
about them.

'If I'd been in it for the money, I would have done something
 else,' she says, adding: 'I'm obsessed with them!'

But not everyone is amused by her choice of career, among them her mother Lesley who confesses that she wishes Kate had chosen to do something else.

'I do find that when I tell people my 
daughter's a dairy farmer, they're not all that impressed,' she admits. 'It does drive
 us round the bend sometimes that she's so obsessed with it all.

'I was slightly hoping that as she got into it, got 
more experienced she got she would think "This is too much like hard 
work" and get out.

'But it didn't work out like that at all. The more she
 got into it, the more you could see that there was no turning back.'

Quite how obsessed with cows, in particular the Holstein Friesian dairy breed, she is becomes clear when you watch First Time Farmers, the Channel 4 reality series in which Kate stars.

Although 
co-stars Robbie, 23, and James, 26, clearly adore their animals, only 
Kate has a bedroom full of cow-themed clothing, soft toys and posters.

Even her chat up lines include cows. 'Are you good at calf rearing or what?' she asks one hapless prospective suitor. 'I'm the best in the West Midlands! I'm a top 
calf rearer!'Â 

Passionate: Kate loves all things Holstein Friesian cow and gets up at 5am to milk 500 of them each day

Beautiful: Kate is based in Herefordshire which sits on the Welsh border and is prime dairy farming country

Fellow farmer: Robbie, 23, whose family own a herd of rare breed pigs, is more typical of young farmers

'There are definitely two sides to me,' she sheepishly admits. 'When I'm at work, I'm very focused but when I'm at Uni, I like to go 
out, party hard and have a good time.'

Despite her penchant for enjoying the odd pint, most of Kate's life revolves around farming, whether studying for her degree in Herd Management or conducting a research project that involves raising 10 calves by hand.

'I literally woke up one morning and 
decided I wanted to be a farmer and milk cows,' she laughs. 'It literally is an 
obsession.'

Like her mother, however, not everyone thinks Kate's passion for cattle should dictate her choice of career, although Kate herself is determined to prove them wrong.

'You have got to be quite a strong 
personality if you're female and you're going to go into dairy farming,' she explains. 'I
 definitely do have a point to prove.

'People don't take me 
seriously because of how I look. The boys call me Barbie because 
I've got my blonde hair extensions in, false eyelashes in, my fake tan, 
my nails and stuff. I'll prove them all wrong!

'If I meet someone in the 
pub or I'm out somewhere and they ask what I do and I say I milk cows, I actually have to get out my phone and show them 
pictures of me milking because they don't believe it.

'Their first guess 
is usually a hairdresser or a beautician or something. I really have to 
persuade them that I do really do this.

'It's only when I start coming 
out with all the [dairy farming] terms, they're like, "Oh yeah, she does 
actually know what she's talking about." I'm like, "Yup, there you go"!'

For now, what the boys think is the least of her concerns. 'I haven't really got time for somebody 
else,' she admits.

'If I wanted a boyfriend, I could get one, like tomorrow. But I 
don't really have time to spend with anybody.'

With 500 cows to milk three times a day, Kate's life is certainly a busy one but she doesn't seem to mind in the slightest.

'I think people 
really do call me the crazy calf lady,' she giggles. 'It's funny though, so I don't mind!'
