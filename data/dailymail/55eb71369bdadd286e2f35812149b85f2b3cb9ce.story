Two holidaymakers on a week-long cruise have claimed they were locked in a 'small, windowless cell' after a fellow passenger falsely accused them of rape.

Eviator Mor and David Amsalem claimed they were held in the brig of a Royal Caribbean Cruises luxury liner for their week-long holiday following a sexual assault allegation which was later withdrawn.

The pair, who had joined the cruise for Mr Mor's 22nd birthday, say they were marched onto the ship's lock-up facility following an accusation of rape by an 'unidentified woman', and kept them there despite the woman recanting her complaint and a doctor deciding she had not been assaulted.

Mr Mor and Mr Amsalem, 26, have since filed a $100million lawsuit against Royal Caribbean Cruises on the grounds of false arrest and imprisonment, assault and battery, and 'outrageous conduct causing emotional distress', according to the New York Post.

Mr Mor, a commercial boiler inspector from Brooklyn, told the New York Post: 'I was in such stress, I can’t explain how scared I was. I got locked up for doing nothing.'

The pair, who are both orthodox Jews from Israel, flew to Fort Lauderdale on February 27 and boarded the Royal Caribbean Cruise ship the 'Liberty of the Seas'.

They claim they were woken at 5am on their first night before being made to wear prison garments and paraded through public areas after the accusation was made.

Their lawsuit states: 'Notwithstanding the woman’s recantation and the doctor’s conclusion... Royal Caribbean’s arresting agents refused to release plaintiffs or to modify the conditions of their imprisonment.'

The pair's lawyer said they were subjected to 'Gestapo tactics', while the rape claim was made by a woman who was drunk and who had been encouraged to make a complaint by travel companions.

A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman said the men had been accused of 'a serious crime,' and that the company 'takes all allegations of crime seriously.

A spokesperson said: 'In this instance, our security personnel onboard followed our established procedures.
