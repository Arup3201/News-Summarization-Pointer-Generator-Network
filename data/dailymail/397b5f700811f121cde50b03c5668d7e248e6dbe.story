For Callum McGregor, this was the most brutal of comedowns after the high of his Scotland call-up.

The 21-year-old spoke for the entire Celtic dressing room when he summed up the feeling of utter dejection in the wake of a dismal defeat against Maribor. The chance of Champions League group stage action - and the accompanying £15million financial influx - seemed at their fingertips following a 1-1 draw in Slovenia last week.

Yet Celtic proved toothless for the most part in the return and were undone when Brazilian Marco Tavares struck the most painful of blows with 15 minutes remaining. That it came after some truly flimsy defending, not an isolated incident this season, made it all the more difficult for Ronny Deila and his players to bear.

Admirably, McGregor was first out to face the media in the interview marquee erected outside Celtic Park. On the other side of the canvas, a couple of hundred fans had massed in front of the main entrance to chant ‘Sack the Board’ and direct more personal ire at chief executive Peter Lawwell.

The recriminations and fall-out will linger for days to come. On Tuesday night, however, it was the immediate pain of defeat that hurt so deeply for McGregor and his colleagues.

‘It’s just devastating,’ said the Parkhead youngster. ‘It’s a really tough one to take. The dressing room was silent at the end. We couldn’t believe it. In the second half, we had a few chances but then we got sucker-punched at the other end.

‘The feeling now is a mix of everything - anger and frustration. As I said, it is devastating. All the boys are absolutely gutted.

‘I’m obviously delighted to be part of the first team but it is hard to be happy when things like that happen. The Champions League was massive for the club. But it also meant everything to all the staff and the players.

‘We will just have to work hard to try to get better. We will look to get better over the course of this season and come back and try to qualify next season.

‘A good week for me has ended quite badly. It’s good to get that recognition from the Scotland squad so I will just keep working hard and try to keep myself in the Celtic team.’

There was understandable apprehension before kick-off but few in a near-capacity crowd expected events to unfold quite the way they did on the Parkhead pitch. Maribor pressed Celtic much higher than in the first leg and knocked Deila’s system out of sync. McGregor struck the bar early in the second half but, in truth, the Slovenians always looked the more likely scorers. From a huge roar at kick-off, the noise around the stadium gradually morphed into one of anxiety and bitter frustration.

‘Were we edgy? It felt like that a wee bit,’ admitted McGregor. ‘They were happy to sit in and defend and that made it difficult for us to try and break down.

‘Once they managed to get a few shots on target the crowd start to get on your back a bit and it becomes difficult again.

‘But I thought the boys managed to regroup quite well at half time. We threw pretty much everything we had at them and we were unlucky at some points. Virgil (Van Dijk) had a couple of efforts and I had one that hit the bar. You can say we were a wee bit unlucky there but you have to defend well at the other end as well.

‘We had an advantage from the first leg and I think everyone expected us to go through tonight. But we conceded a sloppy goal when we were trying to get the winner and maybe we should just have sat and taken the advantage we already had.’

Having seen a Champions League reprieve slip away, Celtic are left grasping at the consolation prize provided by the Europa League.

The hope for Deila is that his team can develop in the same way Neil Lennon’s did when they were involved in the secondary competition three years ago.

‘We didn’t play well against Legia and now we have been knocked out tonight,’ said McGregor. ‘Maybe the Europa League is a stepping stone for us to get better as a squad and come back stronger next year.

‘Neil Lennon’s team did quite well in a Europa League campaign a few years ago. Obviously it is hard when a new manager takes over. He is trying to implant his ideas and his own kind of work ethic into the team. That is going to take time. At a big club like Celtic you don’t have a lot of time. You have to get the results along with the performances and the progression. Maybe the Europa League will give us that platform to improve as a team.’
