Three decades ago his father played an intergalactic smuggler battling the forces of evil in the form of Darth Vader.

Now Malcolm Ford, son of actor Harrison, looks like he could take control of the Millennium Falcon as it tries to avoid Vader's Imperial fleet.

Instead, he has chosen to use a different force as he prepares to take the stage of the O2 in Birmingham.

Malcolm Ford started his band The Dough Rollers in 2008 when he met Jack Byrne - son of Hollywood star Gabriel.

Ten years ago, Malcolm was 17 when he entered into a treatment centre in Los Angeles to help him battle his problems with cannabis.

Reports at the time said he started taking the drug after his parents Harrison and mother Melissa Mathison split. 

The Star Wars star regularly accompanied his son to therapy sessions.

Miss Mathison, a screenwriter, won an estimated £50million settlement in her divorce from Ford, one of the biggest such deals ever awarded in Hollywood.

Ford agreed to split future royalty earnings from films he had made during the marriage - including two Indiana Jones movies, Witness and The Fugitive - as part of the settlement.

In addition, he was to pay around £125,000 a year for the upkeep of Malcolm and his sister Georgia until both turned 21. 

Following the split, Harrison Ford was spotted with Jack Nicholson's ex-girlfriend Lara Flynn Boyle.    

Malcolm Ford and his band The Dough Rollers are touring the UK until the end of the month

Malcolm Ford founded his band 'The Dough Rollers' with Jack Byrne, son of Irish actor Gabriel 

Mathison was Harrison Ford's second wife. He was previously married for 14 years to his college sweetheart Mary Marquardt.

They had two children Ben and Eliel. 

The star is now married to actress Calista Flockhart and have one son, Liam.

According to the Dough Rollers' official website, Malcolm and Jack Byrne started the band after discovering a 'mutual appreciation' of blues music.

As well as appearing with Billy Idol, the band has recently toured with Bob Dylan, John Mellencamp and Queens of the Stone Age.
