Three men have been charged with fraud following an investigation surrounding allegations that Tottenham Hotspur spied on Olympic officials during their stadium bid.

Detectives have been investigating the claims made by West Ham United Football Club and the Olympic Park Legacy Company.

The trio have been charged with fraud over allegations of unlawful obtaining of information linked to the Olympic Park.

Richard Michael Forrest, 30, Lee Stewart, 39, and Howard Hill, 58, are all due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court  on November 28.

Forrest, from Crawley, West Sussex, and Stewart, from Esher in Surrey, are both accused of conspiracy with Hill to commit fraud by false representation.

Hill, from Stockport in Cheshire, is accused of conspiracy with the other two men to commit the same offence.

Hill is a former employee of PKF, a firm of accountants engaged by Tottenham Hotspur to carry out an investigation that was connected with the Olympic Stadium.

Neither the OPLC nor Spurs were willing to comment while legal proceedings are ongoing.

Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) chairwoman Baroness Ford claimed in November last year that Spurs had all 14 members of her board monitored by private investigators.

The north London club denied putting officials under surveillance.

There was a deal with West Ham and Newham Council to use the stadium in Stratford, east London, after the 2012 Games, but that collapsed in October last year.

Tottenham had already lost out to West Ham in the race to become the OPLC's first choice to move into the stadium after the Olympics.

Challenges by Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient, plus an anonymous complaint to the European Commission, led to fears that court action could drag on for years while the stadium remained empty.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
