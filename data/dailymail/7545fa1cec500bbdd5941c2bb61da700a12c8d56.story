A British fortune teller, who set out from Sussex to seek her own fortune when she was in her late teens, has been found naked and dead in a seedy rented room in Vietnam.

Julia Anne Jay, 43, had been renting the room in Saigon, also known as Ho Chi Minh City, since January as she plied her trade as a fortune teller in the nearby streets.

But police have been called to the hotel, located in an alley in the city’s backpacker district, after the staff broke into her room on the second floor and found her body in the initial stages of decomposition.

Tragic fate: British fortune teller Julia Anne Jay, aged 43, was found dead in her hotel room in Ho Chi Minh City

Although there were no obvious signs 
of foul play, police, confirming Miss Jay had been dead for several 
days, said they were continuing their investigations.

It is believed Miss Jay is the same 
woman who set out from her English home in her late teens to travel 
through South East Asia, working her way as she went.

In recent months she has been a 
familiar figure in scarfs and traditional dress, earning what she can in
the Pha Ngu Lao district of the city by turning over her tarot cards 
and reading palms of people in the street.

In a recent interview with the 
ex-patriate magazine AsiaLife, she said she had first learned the ways 
of a fortune teller at the age of eight from a friend of her adopted 
grandmother.

Then, in her late teens, she set off from Sussex for the far east, where she has spent most of her life.

She bought precious stones and silver
in India and sold them in Greece, where a friend gave her a pack of 
tarot cards, she told the magazine.

Then she travelled back to the far 
east, setting up in Bali where she ran a guesthouse for 10 years and 
spent large amounts of time meditating.

She said of her fortune-telling skills: ‘I believe I’m 100 per cent accurate. I wouldn’t be doing it if I weren’t.’

While most of her clients in recent 
times have been Vietnamese - many have hired her to go to their homes - 
she has told fortunes for Western tourists.

Sometimes, she told the magazine, a 
15-minute reading might turn into an emotional two or three-hour 
sessions ending with the customer in tears.

On one occasion, she recalled, a henchman for a local mafia ‘godfather’ came to search her out to set up a session for his boss.

‘Afterwards he (the Mafioso) ordered 
loads of beer and insisted on me staying there,’ she told the magazine. 
‘Then I asked the translator “He’s happy with me, right?” and he said 
“Yes, he loves you. You’re 90 per cent correct.”’

However, Miss Jay said that foreigners displayed mixed feelings about her.

‘Some tourists, mainly young English 
guys, in a foreign country for the first time, are feeling unnerved and 
want to show off. They can sometimes give me a hard time.’

A crowd of people who knew the 
fortune teller gathered outside the small hotel where she had been 
staying when an ambulance came to pick up her body and carry it to the 
mortuary.

Police said the cause of death had yet to be ascertained.
