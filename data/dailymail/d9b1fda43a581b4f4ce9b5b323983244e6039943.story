Dr Joanne Roberts told a news conference that the next three days are 'crucial' as the girls try and recover from their head injuries.  

She also read out a statement from the Soriano family, who are holding a bedside vigil for their daughter.

It read: 'Our family is in shock we appreciate your thoughts and prayer during this tragedy. Our hearts go out the other victims.'

They also asked for privacy during the ordeal.

The popular schoolboy who was a member of the football and wrestling team shot five people with his 'father's gun', killing one, before turning the gun on himself. 

A friend on Twitter said Jaylen was 'heartbroken' over a girl and didn't know what to do. She added that he 'wasn't a bad kid'. 

He had also written messages on his own Twitter page suggesting he may have been facing some troubles, such as: 'It breaks me... It actually does.'
