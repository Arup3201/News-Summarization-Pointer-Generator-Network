Tens of thousands of pounds have been ‘wasted’ on the Government’s inquiry into historic child abuse and key figures are set to be sacked even though it has barely begun.

The controversial eight-strong panel has had seven meetings, as well as ‘listening meetings’ with survivors, putting their bill at well over £25,000 already – despite Theresa May being poised to give them the boot.

Thousands more have been paid to a barrister accused of bullying panel members, while the Home Office has rented central London offices and is paying up to 15 staff to run the back-office operation.

Yet six months after it was set up to investigate claims of VIP paedophile rings dating back to the 1970s, the inquiry is without a chairman, and has not had a proper hearing. 

Last week former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, a key witness, died before giving evidence.

Last night a leading child abuse campaigner branded the panel’s wages ‘a massive waste’. 

Lucy Duckworth, of the Survivors’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s a lot of money spent on the current panel, who don’t have the skills.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Panel members and Counsel to the Inquiry are being paid in line with other inquiries.’
