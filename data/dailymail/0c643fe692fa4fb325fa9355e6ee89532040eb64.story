With New Year’s resolutions long 
forgotten, it seems Britain’s men are now turning their minds to finding
 love - with a bit of help, that is.

Pharmacists
 say they have recorded a surge in sales of slimming productions, 
treatments for premature ejaculation and hair loss solutions.

And
 they say it is no coincidence that this sudden body consciousness 
coincides with the busiest time of the year for dating websites.

Pharmacists say they have recorded a surge in sales of slimming productions, treatments for premature ejaculation and hair loss solutions as men log on for love

In January, sales of treatments for weight problems, hair loss, premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction jumped by 14 per cent compared to December.

Last month, ChemistDirect also saw an increase in the number of men requesting advice on how they can best get in shape for dating.

And while gentlemen across Britain seem to be looking for love, the keenest are in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and Northern Ireland.

It is, perhaps, no surprise that men are keen to give their appeal a boost as last month dating website match.com saw visitors to the site increase by 25 to 30 per cent.

Omar El-Gohary, the Superintendent Pharmacist at ChemistDirect, said: ‘We have found a direct link between the rise in men buying these products and wanting to get back out into the dating scene.

‘Clearly, sales indicate that these four health issues are at the top of men’s agenda for their “health MOT”, particularly as they affect confidence and self-esteem, which are important when dating.

Mr El-Gohary added that he has also seen growing numbers of men aged between 25 and 30 - almost 15 years earlier than normally expected - requesting hair loss, erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation products

He says the biggest rise in sales has been of Regaine, a hair loss shampoo, and Maxbido Male sexual enhancer.

This, he says, suggests men of this age are going through a ‘mini mid-life crisis’.

He
 added: ‘We are seeing a rise in sales of these products among 25 to 
30-year-old men. This is surprising - normally we would expect this rise
 to be in men aged 40 plus.

No coincidence? Last month dating website match.com saw visitors to the site increase by 25 to 30 per cent - as sales of Men-O-T products soared by 14 per cent

‘We think part of this may be because erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation can be exacerbated by stress, and we believe that younger men are being affected due to the economy, work, and pressures in their personal life, such as getting on the housing ladder, paying a mortgage, getting married and having a family.’

This is backed up by a survey of 4,000 people across two generations which found that not only does the current younger generation think their parents had it easy, the over-50s agree.

The poll by Holland and Barrett revealed that better job security and a clock on/off approach to work made life easier 40 years ago, as did a better housing market and the absence of high interest loans and credit cards.
