Arsenal may be facing a 3-1 aggregate deficit ahead of their Champions League clash against Monaco, but Arsene Wenger's squad looked in high spirits as they jetted off to France on Monday afternoon.

Alexis Sanchez and Co left Luton airport following a morning training session ahead of Tuesday night's last 16 tie as they look to overturn Monaco's 3-1 win at the Emirates last month.

Per Mertesacker, Olivier Giroud and Francis Coquelin were all smiles despite the daunting task facing the Gunners, who will need to score at least three goals at the Stade Louis II.

Monaco may have one of the best defensive records in Europe, but Wenger believes Arsenal can produce an unlikely result against the club he guided to the French title 27 years ago.

'We have to put it right. Sometimes in life, you make a big mistake, and there is no comeback, no way you get the chance to put it right again. 

'In football, you can do it, so let's just give everything to do it,' said Wenger, whose side beat West Ham 3-0 on Saturday to cement their place in the top four of the Barclays Premier League.

'We know that (in the first leg) we were impatient and threw ourselves forward too much, that we lost our patience and composure.

'We wanted too much to make a difference in the first game and forgot our basics, that means to defend well and attack well. We just focussed on attacking well, but because a goal didn't go in we opened ourselves up.'

Gunners midfielder Mesut Ozil also insisted that his side can progress into the Champions League quarter-finals, but the German believes Arsenal must score early to do so. 

Speaking to the club's official website, Ozil said: 'It's very important to score early, but we will remain patient. We want to fight and battle from the first minute until the last.

'This is a match that we are determined to win. We have to score three goals and our aim is to do just that while remaining tight in defence.

'If we play as we are capable of doing in Monaco, I still believe that we have a real chance to progress.
