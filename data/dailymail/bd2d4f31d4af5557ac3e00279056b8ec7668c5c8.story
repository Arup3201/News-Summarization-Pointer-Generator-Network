Hartlepool manager Colin Cooper has quit after his side's 3-0 home defeat to Carlisle sent the club to the foot of the Sky Bet Football League Two table.

Former Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest defender Cooper, 47, offered his resignation just over 16 months after being appointed as John Hughes' permanent successor.

'We would like to thank Colin for his efforts during the last eighteen months,' said chairman Ken Hodcroft in a statement on the club's official website.

'We are glad that we gave him his break in management and would like to wish him every success in the future.'

Cooper took his first full-time managerial position when succeeding Hughes at Victoria Park.

But the club were relegated from League One at the end of his first season in charge and have won only two of their 10 league games this time round.

Saturday's 3-0 home defeat to fellow strugglers Carlisle was Pools' third home league defeat this season and sent them to the foot of the table.
