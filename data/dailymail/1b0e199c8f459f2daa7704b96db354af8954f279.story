A retired investment banker who took his own life at his Kensington mansion had become ‘very anxious’ about authorities investigating his former employer, an inquest has heard.

William ‘Bill’ Broeksmit, 58, who was a former executive at Deutsche Bank, killed himself in January after leaving several suicide notes for family and friends.

The inquest at London's High Court heard how Mr Broeksmit retired from his position at the bank in February last year.

William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found hanged at his home in South Kensington, central London, left, on January 26, by his wife Alla, far right, who is pictured with Stella Hayes at a book launch party in 2008

Written medical evidence said he was ‘very anxious’ last summer about authorities investigating areas of banking where he had worked, but did not give any further details.

The former senior manager, who had close ties to the bank's co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain, was found dead at his South Kensington home by his wife, Alla, on January 26.

None of his family was present for the inquest but his lawyer handed a note from his wife to reporters afterwards which said: ‘Bill was a loving husband and devoted father. The children and I are heartbroken by our loss.’

The inquest was told how he had not appeared anxious or depressed when he last saw a doctor in December 2013.

Psychologist William Mitchell said Mr Broeksmit recognised his concerns were due to a state of anxiety rather than reality.

Coroner Fiona Wilcox said there was ‘clear suicidal intent’ in the notes he left but did not give details of their content.

Mr Broeksmit worked in investment banking and lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, pictured, which has an average property value of £1.9million

She said: ‘These notes do provide evidence of intention. I am therefore satisfied … that William Broeksmit did take his own life.’

Mr Broeksmit worked in investment banking - specifically risk and securities - and lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, which has an average property value of £1.9million.

He was also registered to a high-value property a stone's throw from New York's Central Park.

Mr Broeksmit's name appears on US government records for the Broeksmit Family Foundation, which is based in the palatial 1185 Park Avenue building.

The three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment to which he is linked was worth around £2million when it was last sold in June 2000.

Mr Broeksmit, who was born in the United States, was a key founder of Deutsche's investment bank and one of many bankers, including Mr Jain, who joined Germany's flagship lender from Merrill Lynch in the 1990s when Deutsche launched plans to compete on Wall Street.

He was involved in the process of rescuing the bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investment banks found their debts were 'toxic', and unlikely ever to be repaid.

William Broeksmit worked at Deutsche Bank from 1996 to 2001, then from 2008 until he retired (file picture)

Mr Broeksmit, a renowned risk expert, assisted the bank's efforts to shift the worst of the debt, and reduce its total amount of lending.

Chiefs at Deutsche Bank had planned to promote Mr Broeksmit to its management board in 2012, but stopped when the German financial regulator expressed doubts about his experience as a leader.

Deutsche Bank said in a statement after yesterday’s inquest: ‘Bill was not under suspicion of wrongdoing in any matter.’
