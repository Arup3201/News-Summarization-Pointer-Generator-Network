Dangerous joke: Police say Angela Timmons, pictured, 54, who works at Virginia Colleges in Spartanburg County, texted her daughter just after 10 a.m. claiming she 'could hear gun shots being fired inside the school'

A South Carolina woman was arrested today after an April Fools Day prank went terribly wrong.

Police say Angela Timmons, 54, who works at Virginia Colleges in Spartanburg County, texted her daughter just after 10 a.m. claiming she 'could hear gun shots being fired inside the school.'

However, the daughter, April Timmons, who lives in New York couldn't get hold of her mom after receiving the message and, c-oncerned, the 34-year-old proceeded to call 911 to report the incident.

Sheriff's deputies swarmed the college where they discovered that no shooting had occurred.

Sheriff Chuck Wright told WPTV that he was expecting to find a serious situation as he approached the school.

'I'm thinking Columbine High School, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech,' he said.

However, the daughter soon called back after receiving a second text from her mom explaining that it was a prank.

When questioned by Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office deputies, Angela Timmons, who works in 'financial planning' for the school, according to her Facebook page, said she sent the text as a joke.

She said she 'sent the text as an April Fools joke and that she has done such jokes on April Fools in the past.'

In the message, Timmons claimed to her daughter that she was 'hiding in a bathroom for her own safety.'

Scene: Sheriff's deputies swarmed the college, pictured, after the call but arrived to learn that no shooting had occurred.

Worried: The daughter, April Timmons, right, who lives in New York couldn't get hold of her mom, left, after receiving the message and, concerned, the 34-year-old proceeded to call 911

According to investigators, there was 'no record' on Timmons' cell phone indicating that she revealed to her daughter that the text 'was only a joke.'

Wright said he was relieved there wasn't really a shooting but he said was very disappointed at the woman's poor choice.

'Text someone and tell them their tire's flat, that's funny,' Wright said.

'We're talking about death. It's real. The people of Sandy Hook, when they see this online they're not going to think it's very funny. I don't think it's very funny.'

He said his deputies responded to the scene very quickly and were prepared to give their lives to save students and staff.

Timmons was arrested and booked into the Spartanburg county Detention Center.

She is being held there on charges including aggravated breach of peace and disturbing a school.
