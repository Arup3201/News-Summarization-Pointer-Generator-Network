The Croatian city of Zadar is famous for the magical sounds that emanate from its shoreline overlooking the Adriatic Sea.

The work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers, the musical sea organ (morske orgulje) was created in 2005 and is the first of its kind in the world.

Carved into the white stone, the aerophone is 70 meters long and contains a total of 35 organ pipes built under the concrete.

The movement of the sea pushes air through each of the individual organ pipes via a plastic tube submerged in the water.

And depending on the size and power of the wave, unique musical chords are played through each of the whistle openings on the quayside above.

As the sea forces are unpredictable in terms of tidal power, the organ provides a never-ending composition that features numerous musical variations.

The sea organ itself was built as part of a music project that looked to repair Zadar, which had suffered much damage during the Second World War.

It was opened to the public in April 2005 in a bid to redesign the new city coast by having the waves interact with the organ and thus with the people on the shore via the medium of music.

The sea organ was awarded with the prize ex-aequo of the fourth edition of the European Prize for Urban Public Space in 2006.

Zadar is the centre of its namesake county â€“ a part of the wider northern Dalmatian region.

Director Alfred Hitchcock is believed to have said that Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world, which can be seen from the exact spot of where the organ is today.
