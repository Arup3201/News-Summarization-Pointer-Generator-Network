A personal assistant to the James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli has denied stealing a designer watch and more than £11,000 to pay off court and parking fines.

Darren Bailey, 39, is accused of taking a luxury Omega watch -  such as those worn by Bond stars Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan  - which belonged to Bond filmmakers Eon Productions, while working for Ms Broccoli.

The Omega brand first featured in 1995’s GoldenEye, and was used again in the Bafta-winning Skyfall.

Bailey is also accused of using his company card issued by Eon to pay £5,000 in court fines and another £564.96 in parking fines, Southwark Crown Court heard.

It is also claimed he used Ms Broccoli’s bank card to clear a further £4,000 in court fines, fleeced her out of another £1,400 and stole an extra £700 from Eon.

It is alleged Bailey committed the thefts between March 1, 2012, and February 28, 2013.

Bailey entered not guilty pleas to three counts of fraud and three counts of theft.

Judge Alistair McCreath granted Bailey bail on condition that he does not have any contact with anyone from Eon Productions.

He is accused of stealing the Omega watch between September 30 and December 1, 2012, from the company, which has a base in Piccadilly and operates from the world-famous Pinewood Studios.

Los
 Angeles-born Ms Broccoli, 53, has co-produced every 007 film since 
Goldeneye, and was brought into the franchise by her father, legendary 
Bond producer Albert ‘Cubby’ Broccoli.

Ms Broccoli gave evidence as a prosecution witness during Max Clifford’s trial at Southwark Crown Court, where she denied the shamed PR guru had ever met her famous father.

Clifford - jailed for eight years last May - pretended to represent Mr Broccoli when he promised a teenage dancer the chance to be a Bond girl, before molesting her.
