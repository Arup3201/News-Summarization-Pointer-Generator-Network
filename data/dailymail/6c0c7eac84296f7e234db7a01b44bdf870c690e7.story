Texas woman Lanie Brown was only hoping to find some good deals at her nearby flea market when she came across a message to a fallen hero.

Brown says she was visiting the flea market in Hemphill, Texas when she found the flag. While every other flag was selling for $15 or $30, this one was had no price tag because people had written on it. 

Among the two dozen odd messages on the flag: 'We'll always remember the sacrifice you made,' and 'Thank you for being who you were...Rest in peace.'

This tribute flag to a fallen Marine was discovered in a Texas flea market at a discount price because of the writing on it

The flag was in memory of Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel, who's mother Patsy Maciel said she had no idea that such a thing existed or how it found its way to flea market

While the seller thought the writing devalued it, Brown recognized the true meaning immediately.

'We realized it was a flag intended for a fallen Marine,' she told Click2Houston. 'We knew we had to take it home with us.

'She
 said because it had writing on it we could have it for $5. We'd have paid whatever she asked for it. It's priceless.'

The messages revealed that the flag was in memory of Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel.

The Brown family was able to track down the flag's rightful owners thanks to the writing on the stripes

They were able to track his family down in Houston, just two hours away. 

The marine's mother, Patsy Maciel, says she had no idea there was a flag.

'I never knew it existed and here is this flag, in
 a flea market over two hours away from me,' Patsy Maciel said. 'Nobody 
knows how it got there.'

She said he son died in a 2005 helicopter crash in Fallujah at the age of 20.

'He told me he was born to be a marine,' Maciel said. 'He died doing what he loved. I finally had to accept that.'

A flag that once belonged to Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel is unveiled at Calvary Hill Cemetery on Saturday in Humble, Texas

Lanie Brown, who discovered the flag, was familiar with marine custom as both her son and son-in-law are marines

The Brown's immediately had a connection to the Maciel family as their own son-in-law and son are Marine's, with their son-in-law serving in Iraq at the same time as Maciel's son.

At the time the story broke, Maciel and the Browns had yet to meet in person speaking only on the phone.

They planned to meet Saturday at the young Maciel's gavesite where his mother will finally receive the flag that should have been presented to her nearly a decade ago.
