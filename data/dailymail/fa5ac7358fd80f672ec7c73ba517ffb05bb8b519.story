Major League Baseball officials paid a former employee of an anti-aging clinic linked to performance-enhancing drugs for documents, it has been claimed.

It was also claimed that at least one high-profile player linked to now-closed Biogenesis of America in Florida bought documents from a former employee in order to destroy them.

Two unidentified people briefed on the matter also told The New York Times that other baseball stars made efforts to buy potentially incriminating documents to keep them out of the hands of the sport's governing body.

Denials: New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, pictured in October 2012, has denied all claims that he received injections of PEDs from Miami anti-ageing clinic Biogenesis of America

The Miami New Times, an alternative weekly newspaper, in January reported that New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez was among the big leaguers listed in Biogenesis of America's records.

The New Times said it obtained records detailing purchases by Rodriguez, 2012 All-Star game MVP Melky Cabrera, 2005 AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon and 2011 AL championship series MVP Nelson Cruz.

Its exposé claimed the baseball star received cocktails including Human Growth Hormones (HGH) and testosterone creams on a fairly regular basis, according to handwritten notes viewed by someone familiar with the clinic.

Rodriguez's name appears in handwritten notes, reportedly kept by Bosch's clinic, that indicate he received various substances from 2009 up until 2012.

'There was his name, over and over again, logged as either 'Alex Rodriguez', 'Alex Rod', or his nickname at the clinic, 'Cacique,' a pre-Columbian Caribbean chief. Rodriguez’s name appears 16 times throughout,' according to the article.

Rodriguez has denied the claims.

'I have nothing to hide': Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers is also being investigated for his links to the Florida clinic which is now closed. He has said his name appears in records because of a payment dispute

Other baseball players the newspaper said appeared in the records include Gio Gonzalez and Yasmani Grandal.

Later, Yahoo Sports reported that 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun's name also appeared in the records.

Braun subsequently issued a statement
saying: 'I have nothing to hide.' He has said his name appeared because
of an issue over payment for consultancy work relating to his 
successful fight to overturn a 2011 doping ban.

New York Yankees Francisco Cervelli’s (centre in

the MLB is investigating as a potential source of performance-enhancing 
drugs

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig has declined to comment on Biogenesis, other than to say it is the subject of a 'very thorough investigation' by MLB.

Lawsuit: Anthony Bosch faces a claim for unspecified damages after he was accused of doling out banned substances at his Miami clinic

The Times said the payments by the commissioner's office did not exceed more than 'several thousand dollars.'

MLB officials decided to take the unusual step of paying for the documents because, with no subpoena power, its investigators would likely have no access to the material if it wound up in the players' hands, the paper reported.

Last month, Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis, and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned performance-enhancing drugs to players in violation of their contracts.

The lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks unspecified damages from Biogenesis and its operator, Anthony Bosch.

Several other Bosch associates are named in the lawsuit.

Among the banned drugs supplied, the lawsuit said, are testosterone, human growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin.

Baseball officials also unsuccessfully lobbied New Times editors to share the documents that formed the basis of their story.
