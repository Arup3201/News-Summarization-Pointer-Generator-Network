Omari Caro signed off his Hull KR career with a hat-trick of tries as the Robins ended the season on a high with a 42-18 rout of Wakefield.

The 23-year-old former London Broncos winger, who discovered he was being released at the club’s recent end-of-season dinner, scored all his tries before half-time when the visitors held an unassailable 30-0 lead.

Full-back Greg Eden marked his farewell appearance with two tries while 18-year-old winger Macauley Hallett also touched down twice to make it three tries in just two Super League appearances and makeshift scrum-half Craig Hall kicked five goals against the team he will be playing for in 2015.

Rovers took great delight in giving co-captain Josh Hodgson a fitting send-off as he prepares to embark on a new career in Australia with Canberra Raiders and climbing two places in the final table to finish above arch rivals Hull FC.

Wakefield, on the other hand, were unable to provide veteran forward Andy Raleigh with a winning send-off, although he did manage to score a rare try during a second-half revival before hanging up his boots at the final whistle.

It took Caro just two minutes to open his account, taking Eden’s pass to cross at the corner but it was an even-looking contest until the Wildcats came up with the first of a series of clangers that gift-wrapped three tries to their opponents.

Full-back Paul Sykes successfully gathered Travis Burns’ high kick but his wild pass intended for winger Richie Owen missed its target and Hallett struck for his first try on 17 minutes.

Five minutes later, loose forward Neville Costigan put Eden through a gap on halfway and he showed a clean pair of heels to the despairing cover and Hall, who took over the goalkicking duties following Burns’ opening miss, kicked his first conversion to make it 10-0.

Caro then went 90 metres after intercepting Ali Lauitiiti’s pass and completed his hat-trick a minute before half-time after collecting Eden’s perfectly-judged grubber kick.

With Hallett pouncing on another Wakefield handling error to add his second, the game was over as a contest by the break.

Replacement hooker Keal Carlile increased Rovers’ lead four minutes into the second half when he burrowed his way over from dummy half but Wakefield eventually stemmed the tide.

Raleigh was held up over the line before centre Dean Collis opened the Wildcats’ account, collecting Tim Smith’s pinpoint grubber kick and Sykes added the goal.

Eden took a short pass from Burns to register his second try on 57 minutes to make it 42-6 but Wakefield, who finish 12th in the table, restored some pride with two tries in the last 15 minutes.

Winger Chris Riley took Pita Godinet’s long pass to cross at the corner, while Raleigh proved unstoppable on a rampaging solo run from 20 metres out and Sykes kicked his third conversion.

Hull KR lost both Eden and his replacement at full-back Kris Welham through injury but it could not take the gloss off an impressive finish to the season.
