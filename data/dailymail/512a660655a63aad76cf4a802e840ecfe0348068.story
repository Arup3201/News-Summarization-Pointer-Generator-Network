West Brom travel to Bournemouth next... CLICK HERE for the rest of the Last 16 draw

Not quite gone in 60 seconds, but that is what this dramatic late turnaround felt like to those in attendance. Two goals for West Bromwich Albion in quick succession snatched this match away from Hull as the final whistle approached and showed the Capital One Cup is perhaps a competition worth fighting for.

The plaudits go to Saido Berahino, who scored the winner two minutes from time and is fast becoming a crucial figure for boss Alan Irvine.

The England Under 21 forward came off the bench to finish Silvestre Varela’s clever pass from a tight angle. Just one minute and 41 seconds earlier Gareth McAuley had rescued what looked a lost cause by connecting sweetly with a half-volley after Hull failed to clear a corner.

Steve Bruce criticised his players for failing to hold on to a lead for the fourth time this season, after dropped points against Newcastle, West Ham and Stoke.

‘It’s a huge concern for me because it’s not like us,’ Bruce said. ‘There is a frustration and disappointment etched on every one of us.

‘We were so comfortable then we don’t defend a corner and all of a sudden they are level. The third one is a lack of concentration.’

For Irvine, things are looking up. This victory came four days after his first in charge of West Brom in the shock at Tottenham.

‘I thought we deserved it,’ he said. ‘We kept going and created chances. I’ve felt things were getting better in recent weeks with more players back to the level of fitness we need.’

The only aspect to concern Irvine was an ankle injury to Brown Ideye, sustained as the club-record £10million striker netted his first goal for the club. ‘Bittersweet,’ is how Irvine described the moment Ideye scored, following up Sebastian Blanco’s saved header from two yards, but he got a kick from David Meyler in the 15th minute.

It had looked like Hatem Ben Arfa would steal the show with his assist for what seemed like Robbie Brady’s winner five minutes after the interval.

Darting into space outside the box, Ben Arfa played a through ball with his left boot that split West Brom’s defenders so Brady could slot past Boaz Myhill.

West Brom and Hull both made 11 changes from their last line-ups as Irvine and Bruce made their priorities clear.

Ben Arfa, on his first Hull start, was handed a free role behind Yannick Sagbo, and there were recalls for Tom Ince, James Chester and Alex Bruce.

Irvine handed a full debut to Blanco, the Argentine winger on loan from Metalist Kharkiv, and gave academy graduate Liam O’Neil, 21, his first start for the club. Victor Anichebe partnered fellow Nigerian Ideye up front.

Ideye has not experienced the kind of introduction to English football for which Albion supporters might have hoped, but Irvine believes his goal here will boost confidence.

Hull levelled out of the blue four minutes before half-time. Sagbo picked out Brady on the left and his low cross travelled far into the West Brom box before Ince arrived to ram a finish past Myhill. It was the midfielder’s first goal for Hull since his summer move but his night turned sour in a dramatic finish.

PS. Along with Crystal Palace, Hull, and Tottenham, West Brom made 11 changes to their last starting XI that beat Tottenham 1-0 in the Premier League.
