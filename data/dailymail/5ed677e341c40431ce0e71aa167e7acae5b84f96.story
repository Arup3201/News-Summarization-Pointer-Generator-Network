Britain's Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said the Government had not addressed the need to encourage marriage

Stay-at-home mothers have been let down by David Cameron, Britain’s Chief Rabbi said last night.

Lord Sacks said in a parting message to ministers that the Government had not addressed the need to encourage marriage and needed to give ‘more support’ to full-time mothers.

George Osborne angered traditional Conservatives earlier this month by suggesting that choosing to stay at home to look after children was a ‘lifestyle choice’.

The Chief Rabbi is to step down next month after 22 years in the role. He told The Times: ‘I think the Government has not done enough.

‘Although I don’t take a party political stance . . . I don’t think the Government has done enough at all. The State has an interest in marriage because the cost of family breakdown and non-marriage, the last time I looked at it, was estimated at £9billion a year.

‘[The Government] should certainly recognise marriage in the tax system, it should certainly give more support to mothers who stay at home, or for childcare provision.

‘I don’t believe in getting involved in the details, but the principle is pretty clear.’

Lord Sacks’s comments come after it emerged that mothers who look after their children at home will miss out on vouchers worth up to £1,200 per year to help working parents fund childcare costs.

The £1billion scheme is available to families in which both parents work and earn up to £300,000 a year. Households in which one parent stays at home, which includes more than one million families, will be excluded from receiving the childcare vouchers.

In further comments, he said allowing ethnic groups to keep to themselves had led to ‘segregation and inward-looking communities’.

Chancellor George Osborne angered traditional Conservatives earlier this month by suggesting that choosing to stay at home to look after children was a 'lifestyle choice'

He said multiculturalism was like a hotel where ‘nobody is at home’. ‘It doesn’t belong to anyone, we’ve each got our room and so long as we don’t disturb the neighbours we can do whatever we like.’Despite this, he said he understood the difficulties that British Muslim communities faced when trying to integrate.

‘We’ve had 26 centuries of experience, which most Muslims haven’t,’ he said.

‘The norm was for Muslims to live under a Muslim jurisdiction and the norm, since the destruction of the first temple, was for Jews to live under a non-Jewish jurisdiction.’
