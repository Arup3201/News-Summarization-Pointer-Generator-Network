Found: Edmarie Lafontaine-Perez was discovered safe and well in a Miami-Dade jail under the alias Tieres Rodriguez-Perez - she had been arrested on January 27 and her disappearance had sparked a statewide hunt for her

The aspiring Puerto Rican actress whose parents feared had been sucked into the sex trade has been found safe and relatively well in a Miami-Dade jail.

Edmaire Lafontaine-Perez, 21, was arrested on January 27 on charges of defrauding an innkeeper, resisting an officer without violence and bribery under the alias of Tieres Rodriguez-Perez, Fort Lauderdale Police said on Monday.

Her frantic parents, including father Edwin Lafontaine, have been informed their daughter is fine, ending their panic which began on January 26 when she made a disturbing and disjointed phone call in which she told her mother that she was being chased and was in fear of her life.

Her mother, Manuela Perez, told Univision Radio that she doesn't know how the young girl ended up in jail.

'I have not spoken to her, but in due time we will know,' her mother said. 'Thank God my daughter is fine and it is a miracle.'

Edmarie Lafontaine, originally from Puerto Rico, moved to Fort Lauderdale in December to study biology but also expressed an interest in becoming an actress - and her parents became concerned that she had fallen in with the wrong crowd.

The hysterical January 26 phone call where relatives say she sounded high on drugs was the last contact the missing woman had with her family before disappearing almost three weeks ago.

Relieved: Her father Edwin Lafontaine had appeared on Florida state television to appeal for the safe return of his daughter who he believed had been taken into the sex trade

Vanished: Edmarie Lafontaine disappeared in 
Miami on January 26 after making a final frantic phone call to her 
family in her native Puerto Rico

Busted: Edmarie Lafontaine-Perez, 21, was found incarcerated in the Miami-Dade Corrections facility on charges of defrauding an innkeeper, resisting an officer without violence and bribery

The Department of Homeland Security's human trafficking division has an open investigation into Lafontaine-Perez's disappearance, and had contacted Fort Lauderdale Police on January 31.

Authorities have spent the past two and a half weeks searching for her, only to find her in jail.

Her father Edwin Lafontaine told NBC South Florida that the last time he heard from his daughter she was petrified, and that he fears she may have been forced into a life of prostitution.

'She told her mother she feared for her 
life, that they were chasing her,' he told the station. 'We don't want 
to think about that and punish ourselves but itâ€™s a possibility she may 
be a victim of human trafficking.'

Close-call: Edmarie Lafontaine, originally from Puerto Rico, moved to Fort Lauderdale in December to study biology but also expressed an interest in becoming an actress - her father says pursuing that dream may have put her in contact with the wrong crowd

Family told Spanish-language newspaper El Nuevo Dia that she spoke erratically and sounded as if she was high on drugs during that fateful phone call.

When the worried parents didn't hear from their daughter again after the distressed phone call, which came from a restricted number, the family immediately flew to Fort Lauderdale.

Mr Lafontaine said that their daughter's belongings were at the hotel she was staying at but she had never returned.
