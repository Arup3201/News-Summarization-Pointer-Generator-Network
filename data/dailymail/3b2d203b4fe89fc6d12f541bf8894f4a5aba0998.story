The Kennedy clan has been accused of acting 'like an organised crime family' in the aftermath of Kerry Kennedy's hit and run arrest.

The 52-year-old daughter of the late Robert F Kennedy has been charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs after she careered into a truck on Interstate 684 north of New York City on Friday.

In the days following the crash, police sources claim her family members have taken part in an aggressive PR operation in a bid to cloud the facts surrounding her arrest.

Arresting officers found Mrs Kennedy unable to walk, talk or see straight in the aftermath of Friday's accident.

After initially admitting she may have taken the powerful sleeping pill Ambien prior to the crash, Mrs Kennedy has since insisted there were no drugs or alcohol in her system - claiming instead she suffered a seizure.

She backed that up with the results of private blood and urine tests that she hurriedly underwent in the hours after the crash and which which were released just moments after her arrest was announced by police.

The Kennedy family insist official tests will also come up clean.

But officials are unhappy with the 'aggressive' way in which the clan are attempting to control the case.

A law enforcement source told the New York Post: 'The family is so aggressive, they act like some organized-crime family.

'Ninety minutes after the State Police issued a press release, (Kennedy spokesman) Ken Sunshine puts out a release that says she’s clean.

'Right now, they’re obfuscating. I don’t believe any of it.'

Mrs Kennedy was surrounded by relatives on Tuesday night as as she emerged from court in Amonk, New York after entering her not guilty plea.

Speaking to reporters she claimed numerous neurological tests show that she suffered a 'partial seizure' which was the result of a previous head injury

She added: 'I want to apologise to the driver of 
the truck who I apparently hit and all those who I apparently 
endangered,’

‘A MRI showed an area of hypo-density which appears to be the result of a head injury sustained some time ago,' she said. Kennedy concluded that doctors believe the accident was caused by a partial seizure.

She added that this was the only seizure she had ever suffered and would continue to get treatment over 'the months ahead and, perhaps, indefinitely.'

Recalling Friday's accident she said, 'I remember getting onto the highway and then I have no memory until I was at a traffic light and a police officer was at my car door.'

'I have never had any history of drug or alcohol abuse and in my discussion with the police officer I was confused and erratic,' she continued.

She told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem.

The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy 
crashed into on Friday spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's 
daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the 
Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered 
off the interstate.

He told 
the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really 
drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody.

'I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I’m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated.

'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.'

He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes.

'She started 
coming at me, like she didn’t see me. She was starting to nod off,
her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said.

'I hit the horn. I couldn’t go back into
the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could
either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do.

'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me.

'When she hit me, my left tire tore up 
her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.'

One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said.

Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really 
drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled 
out of bed.

Friday's collision came just two months
after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after 
struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse.

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.
