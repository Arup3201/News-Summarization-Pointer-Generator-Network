Almost 150 Gurkhas were kicked out of the Army today, under the first wave of sweeping cuts to the UK's military.

A total of 920 soldiers and another 930 RAF personnel were told they were being made redundant - 750 of them against their will.

The Ministry of Defence has not confirmed which units were affected - but it is understood no RAF ground crews based in Italy and supporting operations in Libya were included.

Under threat: A total of 150 Gurkhas, such as these from the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, are to be made redundant as part of the Government cuts

Staff were being informed primarily by their commanding officers at various barracks and in some cases by telephone.

The Army is making around 260 compulsory redundancies as part of the Coalition's efforts to tackle the deficit and bring the defence budget under control.

The MoD expects some Gurkhas facing the axe to transfer to other infantry regiments which are currently below full strength.

A total of 869 soldiers applied for redundancy but only 660 of them are being allowed to leave.

In a message sent to all personnel, Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards said: 'While for some redundancy may be seen as an opportunity, for others it will understandably represent a significant challenge for both the individual and their families.

'I am aware that this continues to be an unsettling time and that this only represents the first tranche of redundancy.

'Throughout this period we need to remain focused on operations and maintaining the quality that makes our Armed Forces, person for person, the finest in the world.'

The head of Army manning, Brigadier Richard Nugee, said in April that the cuts to the 3,500-strong Brigade of Gurkhas were necessary following recent changes to the Gurkhas' terms of service that placed them on the same footing as the rest of the Army.

Some 622 British airmen and women sought voluntary redundancy, of whom 440 had their applications granted. The RAF is also making about 490 compulsory redundancies.

Spared: It is understood that RAF ground crews based in Italy and supporting operations in Libya will not be included in the redundancies

The plans to cut the posts were announced earlier this year as part of a programme which could see 11,000 redundancies across the RAF, Army and Royal Navy by April 2015.

Personnel receiving the operational allowance, paid to those serving on the front line in Libya and Afghanistan, will be exempt from redundancy.

Sad news: Defence Secretary Liam Fox blamed the cuts on the previous Labour government for leaving the country's finances broken

Troops who are about to deploy to Afghanistan or who have recently returned from duty there were also protected from losing their jobs.

Members of the armed forces accepted for voluntary redundancy will serve six months' notice, while those forced out will serve a year.

Defence Secretary Liam Fox said: 'The responsibility for these redundancies lies with the incompetence of the last Labour government who left the nation's finances broken and a Â£38 billion black hole in the defence budget.

'The tough measures we have taken will bring the budget largely into balance for the first time in a generation.

'The extra money we have allocated for the equipment budget from 2015 will allow our defence capability to grow in the second half of the decade.

'Of course redundancies are always sad news, but we will continue to have strong and capable forces and we appreciate the hard work of our brave armed forces.'

Sacking hundreds of Army and RAF personnel will have 'long-term consequences' for the UK, Labour has warned.

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy told BBC Breakfast that while savings were necessary, 'they are probably going too quickly, too deeply in cutting the deficit'.

He added: 'A bigger worry is that while we all know that the deficit is temporary, the cuts at this stage are permanent.

'Once you sack an RAF trainee pilot they aren't coming back, they're gone for good. So, this has got very long-term consequences for our country.'
