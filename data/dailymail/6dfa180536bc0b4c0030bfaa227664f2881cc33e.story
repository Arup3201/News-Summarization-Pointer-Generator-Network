The Duke of Edinburgh opened the new headquarters of armed forces charity SSAFA today - weighed down by 17 medals and decorations of his own.

The 92-year-old wore a chestful of military awards as he accompanied the Queen to open the new base of the charity formerly known as the Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen Families Association at Queen Elizabeth House in central London.

The Duke, who joined the Royal Navy straight from school in 1939 and was decorated for his bravery in the Second World War before leaving when his wife ascended the throne in 1952, today joked with a young soldier who lost both legs in Afghanistan, telling him he ought to get some wheels.

Heavily-decorated: The Duke of Edinburgh, who served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War, wore 17 medals and decorations to visit the new SSAFA charity HQ in central London today

You should get yourself some wheels: The 92-year-old Duke joked with amputee Trooper Cayle Royce, 27

Trooper Cayle Royce, who lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan last year, said meeting Philip was an honour.

'He’s my hero,' the 27-year-old South African soldier said.  'He’s just a great person - really comedy.'

Asked why he was laughing with the Duke, he said: 'He told me I should lose the feet and put some wheels on my prosthetics.

'He said it will be easier to get around.'

The Duke wore his full complement of decorations to comply with organisers' request that all guests wear medals.

His include the Greek War Cross Of Honour, awarded for his bravery in the Battle of Cape Matapan against the Italian Navy in 1941.  Aged just 19, he operated the searchlights against the Italians during a bloody gun battle in which he said later 'all hell broke loose', and he was Mentioned in Despatches for his courage.

Today Philip and the Queen both spoke to Trooper Royce, who is planning to row 3,000 miles with another amputee soldier across the Atlantic next month.

Little Hayley Inns, six, whose brother Rifleman Martin Kinggett died in Afghanistan in 2010, met the Queen

Military occasion: The Queen was greeted by her cousin, the charity's president, Prince Michael of Kent

The soldier with the Light Dragoons, who now lives in Dartmouth, said he spoke to the monarch about how his Row2Recovery challenge has been supported by a grant from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry’s charitable organisation, The Royal Foundation.

Having been patron of SSAFA for 60 years, the Queen was given a medal to mark the occasion.

General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, SSAFA’s chairman, joked as he presented it to her: 'See it as a variation of a Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.'

The Queen, who was greeted by her cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, who is the charity’s president, also unveiled a plaque at the charity's headquarters in St Dunstan’s Hill.

After meeting various charity beneficiaries, volunteers and staff, she was given a posy by six-year-old Harley Inns, whose brother, Rifleman Martin Kinggett, was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.

Rifleman Kinggett, from 4th Battalion The Rifles, died of a gunshot wound while giving covering fire for an injured colleague.

Harley, who wore her brother’s service medals, said the Queen asked her: 'Are those for me?'

The schoolgirl was joined by her mother, Lisa, father, Craig and sister, Georgia, 16, as she presented the Queen with the flowers, which she said was 'fun'.

The Queen wore a kingfisher blue jacquard dress and wool crepe detailed coat by Peter Enriole and a matching hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan.

The 92-year-old Duke joined the Royal Navy in 1939, aged 19, and served throughout the Second World War and on until 1953, when he gave up his active career in the Navy after the Queen ascended the throne.

Since then he has held various military posts, including Admiral of the Fleet and Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy.
