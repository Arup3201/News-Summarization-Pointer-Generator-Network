Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith left more than £1million to his Blue Peter presenter wife when he died, it has emerged. 

Smith, who died aged 59 in August from complications arising from major heart surgery, was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1980s.

Probate records revealed yesterday that he left his entire estate after funeral and legal bills to Sarah Greene - his wife of 25 years. The amount left in his will totalled £1,190,284.

His estate would not have included any assets or property jointly owned with his wife. 

Smith presented Radio 1's flagship breakfast show between 1986 and 1988 and was described as Princess Diana's favourite DJ.

Known for his boyish good looks and affectionately dubbed 'Smitty', he was a regular on Top of the Pops.

He also made frequent appearances on the BBC's Breakfast Time programme and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, hosted by Noel Edmonds.

Other programmes he presented included That's Showbusiness and Julian Clarey's Trick Or Treat.

His experience as a live broadcaster and his knowledge of popular music led to him hosting the BBC's Live Aid broadcast in 1985.

He managed to remain cool and calm even when an emotional Bob Geldof swore on air as he tried raise more money for African famine relief.

Smith, of Chiswick, west London, was a keen motorsports fan who built his own cars and competed in motor racing from the age of just 14.

He and Greene married in 1989, a year after they were both injured when the helicopter he was piloting crashed in Gloucestershire. Greene broke both of her legs and an arm in the crash, while Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. 

He founded his company Flying TV in 2004 to provide aerial filming services to broadcasters, but continued to make occasional TV appearances.

His death came as a shock to friends and former colleagues, including fellow Radio 1 alumni Edmonds and Mike Read, who he reportedly had not told he was unwell.

Mr Read was among the first to pay tribute to the ‘affable, businesslike’ former DJ in the wake of his death.

The DJ and television personality said: ‘The news is just devastating. Sarah and Mike were a wonderful couple – it is truly horrible to hear.

‘I knew Mike as there were only five of us to have presented the Breakfast Show at that time.

‘He became a mainstay of Radio 1, was highly successful on television too, and started up his own business, which he was very good at.

'I worked with Sarah for a number of years, including around the time of the crash, so I was very fond of them both. The helicopter crash was really bad but they just got on with it and married.

‘Mike was a very affable guy, fantastically business-like. It’s a real loss and has come as quite a shock.’

Other friends and colleagues paid tribute on social networking sites such as Twitter.

Keith Chegwin described him as ‘a nice man and a great broadcaster’ who died ‘far too young’. 

Phillip Schofield, who presented the flagship children’s television show Going Live with Greene, said: ‘There are no words. My wonderful, bright, funny, thoughtful friend Mike Smith has passed. I’m so sorry, my darling Sarah.’

And radio presenter Simon Mayo wrote: ‘Shocked to hear of Mike Smith’s death. Condolences to Sarah and all his family.’
