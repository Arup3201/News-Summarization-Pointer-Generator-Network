Racy window displays at a recently opened adult store in Oklahoma City have been blamed for a spike in the number of crashes in the surrounding area.

The Hustler Hollywood store, which sells a wide variety of lingerie and sex toys, only opened on June 12 but since then police have reported eight crashes nearby.

One man involved in a fender bender near the store contacted local TV news to complain about the ‘distracting’ displays.

‘I just had a minor fender bender looking at the mannequins in the window of the new Hustler Hollywood store,’ wrote Gary, who only provided KOCO with his first name and didn’t file a police report.

‘We both (drivers) agreed that it was going to cause lots of accidents.’

A spokesperson for Hustler denied there was anything overly provocative about the mannequins and described the display as tasteful and decent.

Store management have said they have no plans to take them down.

'You see worse things walking in the mall and in the movies,' passing driver Diane Ray Sanders told KOCO.

'Tell distracted drivers to look at what’s going on in traffic and stop worrying about everything else.'

Hustler Hollywood, part of Larry Flint’s Hustler empire, is described as 'an upscale, modern erotic boutique dedicated to providing a sophisticated shopping experience for the sexually curious.'

The chain of 13 stores sell a selection of toys, erotica, 
lingerie, shoes, apparel and novelties. The flagship store is in West Hollywood on the renowned Sunset Strip.
