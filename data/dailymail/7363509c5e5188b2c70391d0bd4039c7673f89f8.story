A Russian supermodel who claimed £83,000 seized by police in one of the biggest crackdowns on organised crime was lawfully hers has lost her case at the Old Bailey today.

Oxana Zubakova, 37, who has modelled for Armani and Dior, said the cash, which was entirely in 500 euro notes, did not come from her criminal ex-boyfriend Tarik Meghrabi.

Meghrabi, 42, is serving five years and nine months after being convicted of a £35million money laundering scam. His father Ziad is doing a 10-year stretch for similar offences.

The Serious Organised Crime Agency 
(SOCA) - now known as the National Crime Agency - confiscated the contents 
of Ms Zubakova’s safety deposit box, which was opened three weeks after 
Ziad Meghrabi was jailed, when they raided more than 6,000 boxes as part of 
Operation Rize in June 2008.

They said they had ‘reasonable grounds to suspect the money was the proceeds of crime.’

During
 the raids they recovered more than £53million in cash, some of which 
had been stuffed into supermarket bags, at deposit box centres in 
Hampstead, Edgware and Park Lane, as well as jewellery, gold, drugs, 
weapons, artworks and fake ID documents.

The 37-year-old former model said a wealthy businessman funded her lavish lifestyle after the pair met in Majorca in 2004

SOCA
 were granted an order allowing them to forfeit the cash from Ms 
Zubakova’s box, plus a £5,500 Tiffany pendant and an £11,000 Cartier 
necklace found inside, which were gifts from her former boyfriend.

He was also a co-signatory on the box although there is no evidence he ever accessed it himself.

But last week Ms Zubakova appeared via videolink from Moscow to try and claim it back.

She
 told the court it had come from her own earnings and money given to her
 by an elderly ‘friend’- Majorcan millionaire Miguel Buadas, who had 
been bankrolling her since she met him in 2004.

But a panel of justices headed by Recorder Martyn Levett threw the case out.

Judge Levett said: 'We have reached a conclusion and are unanimously of the view that this application should be dismissed.'

He added he would give full reasons for the decision on Friday.

The
 court heard the ex-model, who now runs her own modelling agency OMM, 
lived a lavish lifestyle of ‘glamour and luxury travel’ and often had 
thousands of euros in cash ‘because that was how she got paid.’

She
 was a professional athlete before winning a $250,000 contract with 
Elite models after coming first in a modelling competition in Russia 
when she was 15.

From then 
on she travelled the world working for fashion houses Giorgio Armani, 
Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Etro among other major 
international brands.

She 
said hotelier Mr Buadas, who made £50million from selling the five star 
Hotel Formentor in Majorca in 2006, splashed out on apartments for her 
in Moscow and Barcelona and put £250,000 into a Channel Island bank 
account for her to spend.

He
 also subsidised her jet set life by ensuring she had access to 
thousands from bank accounts in Russia and Spain, the court was told.

Ms Zubakova was able to purchase a £113,000 Mercedes in cash and once withdrew £70,000 in just one week.

And she had amassed a personal fortune of over £500,000 in her own bank account in Russia.

Her barrister Philip Hackett QC said she was a wealthy Russian in her own right before she even met the Meghrabis.

But
 lawyers for SOCA said they had reason to believe she was stashing the 
cash for Tarik Meghrabi to potentially use at a later date.

The
 court heard the couple, who dated from 2005 to 2008, lived in a swanky 
Mayfair apartment and had shared bank accounts and credit cards, 
including a premier American Express card they could book exclusuive 
concierge services through.

But Ms Zubakova claimed she always paid her way throughout the relationship.

The model did not appear in court today but will be notified of the decision through her barrister.

According
 to her website she founded modelling agency OMM in 1999 and is now a 
property entrepreneur whose London projects reportedly include the Mari 
Vanna restaurant and 50 St James’s Street club.
