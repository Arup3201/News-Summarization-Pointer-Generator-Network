A father-of-three who was so overweight that he was afraid of getting stuck in a plane seat has shed seven stone - and taken his first overseas holiday.

At 22st and the owner of a 52" waist, Marshal Laverick, from Stanley in County Durham, was overweight and desperately in need of a change.

After one of his knees collapsed under the strain, he finally decided to overhaul his diet and has lost seven stone in just two years.

'Last year was the first time I’d had a holiday abroad,' he confirms. 'I was scared to go on the plane because of the size of the seats.'

Now tipping the scales at a svelte 15st and boasting a slim 38 inch waist, Mr Laverick says he still has to battle cravings but is happier than ever.

'My whole life has changed for the better,' he beams. 'It had to change. It’s been fantastic.'

Mr Laverick, who says he hopes to inspire other slimmers with his story, was a perpetual overeater who lived on an unhealthy diet of takeaways before joining his local Slimming World group.

Over the last two years, the former telecoms worker's diet and lifestyle have undergone a transformation with greasy food swapped for healthy homemade meals and regular exercise.

Successful: So adept is Mr Laverick at losing weight, he now runs his very own Slimming World group

However, despite his stunning success, Mr Laverick says slimming down hasn't been easy and admits that he still struggles with cravings.

'It’s good but the festive period is a nightmare,' he says. 'Last year I put on 12lbs but I’ll be doing things differently this year.

'You have to stick at it, you’ve got to be able to stand in front of the group. 'Slimming World has changed what I eat, I still eat things like Yorkshire puddings but I’ll only have one rather than four or five.

'I’ve got my own group now and it starts on December 30.'

Speaking about Mr Laverick's achievements, Tracey Little, who oversees Mr Laverick's Slimming World group, said: 'We provide support 52 weeks of the year.

'Our members know from the minute they first walk through the door, often when their self-esteem is at its lowest, that they will never be judged, that their details will be completely confidential and that they are with people who understand them - because they’ve been Slimming World members themselves.'
