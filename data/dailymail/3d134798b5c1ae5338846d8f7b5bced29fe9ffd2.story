After vowing to take 'a long, long break' from acting, Leonardo DiCaprio has instead turned his attention to developing his property portfolio and has completed on deals worth more than $23 million in the past four months.

The latest addition to Leo's growing real estate empire is a $10 million apartment at the health-centric Delos building in New York’s Greenwich Village.

The Wolf Of Wall Street star has purchased a two-bedroom, two and half bath apartment on the fourth floor of the building at 66 West 11th St., under the corporation name of his Malibu Colony PCH Property, LCC, reports the New York Post.

The complex - which has WELL certification for its holistic approach to improving human wellness - boasts facilities including vitamin C-infused showers, purified air and water, and a circulated aromatherapy air supply.

It also boasts posture-supportive heat reflexology flooring and 'dawn simulation' provided by a circadian lighting design.

In addition, Donna Karan's Urban Zen is providing the building's residents with a 'wellness concierge' to ‘curate and coordinate your daily wellness experience.’

Lucky Leo has also been told he can use a $1 million parking space that comes with the building’s 8,000-square-foot duplex penthouse until that apartment is sold.

Getting serious: Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly moved his girlfriend Toni Garrn, seen here earlier this month, into his recently purchased $8 million Battery City Park apartment

Expansion plans: The actor already owns an apartment in the Battery Park City building but in March bought his neighbour's 2,300-square-foot unit for $8 million

The 39-year-old actor has been on a property buying spree recently, splashing out $8 million in March on a two-bedroom apartment adjacent to a $4 million apartment that he has owned at the eco-friendly 2 River Terrace in Battery Park City since 2008.

The expectation is that DiCaprio will combine the 2,327-square-foot apartment with his existing home, although he has yet to file plans to combine the two units.

According to InTouch, the Titanic actor has moved the 21-year-old model girlfriend Toni Garrn into the recently purchased unit.

A source told the magazine: 'Leo bought the apartment [in March] and quickly moved Toni in with him.

'It seems like they’re really enjoying living together.'

The source 
added that the couple - who have been dating for almost a year - always 
look 'happy' and 'relaxed' when around the exclusive Riverhouse 
apartment building.

Holiday home: The Wolf Of Wall Street actor also recently purchased this $5.23 million residence in Palm Springs

In February the 39-year-old actor spent $5.2 million on a six-bedroom mansion in Palm Springs, California.

The 1.34 acre property has seven bathrooms, a detached state-of-the art gymnasium, a pool house and a tennis court with a glass pavilion surround.

The multi-level, single-story mansion, which was designed by architect Donald Wexler, was built in 1965 and, although it's been fully renovated, it still features mid-century architecture.

Leo's property empire also includes a large beachfront 
estate in Malibu, California.

DiCaprio, who missed out on a Best Actor Oscar for his role in The Wolf Of Wall Street, recently told Germany's daily Bild that, after working on three films in two years, he's taking a break.

'I am a bit drained. I’m now going to take a long, long break,' the actor said. 'I’ve done three films in two years and I’m just worn out.'
