Television wildlife expert David Bellamy is selling his £20,000 collection of historic microscopes and scientific slides - because he is moving to France.

The botanist is best known for fronting a series of nature programmes in the 1980s and 1990s but away from the cameras he indulged in a hobby collecting  scientific microscopes dating back hundreds of years.

Also in his archive are wooden cabinets stacked full of thousands of microscope slides of examples of flora and fauna from all over the British Isles.

David Bellamy decided to sell the collection because he and his wife Rosemary are moving from their home in Durham, where they have lived since 1960, to France

Among the 12 brass microscopes is a rare George Adams New Universal dating back to 1746 which has been valued at as much as £7,000.

Another, a Watson Van Heurck binocular microscope from 1890, could sell for £5,000.

Mr Bellamy, now 81, decided to sell the collection because he and his wife Rosemary are moving from their home in Durham, where they have lived since 1960, to France.

The collection, which is being sold in 24 lots, has been tipped to sell for £20,000 when it goes under the hammer at Tennants Auctioneers in Leyburn, North Yorkshire.

Kegan Harrison, an expert in scientific instruments at Tennants, said: 'This is David Bellamy’s personal collection of microscopes and slides which he put together over the course of his career.

'There are around 12 microscopes and about 20 cabinet boxes containing thousands of scientific slides of all sorts of flora and fauna, mostly from round Britain.

'Mr Bellamy was a big name in botany and was one of the best loved television presenters of his time.'

He has lived in County Durham for decades but now he has decided to move to France to enjoy the good life so he is selling his collection of microscopes.

'The very fact they belong to Mr Bellamy will put a premium on them. Auctioneering is all about provenance, and this collection has a fantastic back story.

'Microscopes are popular items to collect but these are the very ones which David Bellamy has looked through and slides he has studied, and that makes them very special indeed.'

David Bellamy first found fame in 1967 as an environmental consultant for the Torrey Canyon disaster, one of the world’s most serious oil spills, before launching his first TV series Bellamy on Botany in 1972.

He has since written and presented some 400 television programmes on botany, ecology, and environmental issues, including the much-loved 80s show Bellamy’s Backyard Safari.

The collection, to be sold in 24 lots, includes this Powell and Lealand contraption

He was a lecturer in botany at Durham University from 1960 until 1982 and is he is still an Honorary Professor for Adult and Continuing Education.

In 2004 he courted controversy when he stated that the theory of man-made global warming was 'poppy-cock'. He is also an opponent of wind farms.

The auction takes place on October 29.
