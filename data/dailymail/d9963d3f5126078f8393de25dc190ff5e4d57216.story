Tipped for the top: Senior insiders believe the Very Rev Jeffrey John is a strong contender to become the next bishop of Monmouth

A controversial Church of England dean could become Britain’s first openly gay bishop.

Senior insiders believe the Very Rev Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans, is a strong contender to become the next bishop of Monmouth.

If elected next month, the Welsh-born cleric would be the UK’s first Anglican bishop in a civil partnership, a development that would send shockwaves through the Church worldwide.

However, insiders said the mood in Britain was changing and many worshippers would accept a gay bishop as long as he was celibate, as Dr John is.

The dean, a respected theologian, is said to have been unfairly treated because of his sexuality.

Dr John, a prominent advocate for gay marriage, was at the centre of a storm over gay clergy in 2003 when he was forced to step down as bishop of Reading by the then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams after a backlash by conservatives, particularly in Africa and Asia.

The men were close friends, but colleagues of Dr John, right, also accuse Dr Williams of helping to block the dean from becoming bishop of Southwark in 2010.

Dr John, who has been in a civil partnership with hospital chaplain the Rev Grant Holmes for seven years, has even considered suing the Church of England for discrimination and hired a leading employment lawyer.

The Church of England has now relaxed a ban on clergy in civil partnerships becoming bishops, but friends believe 60-year-old Dr John stands little chance of getting a post in England because he has been too outspoken.

Insiders believe that he has more chance in the Church in Wales, which is headed by its own archbishop, Barry Morgan.

Archbishop Morgan, a leading liberal, has made it clear he would be happy to welcome a gay bishop.

But although Dr John was born in Tonyrefail, South Wales, close to the Monmouth diocese, he has spent most of his career in the Church in England, which may prove a disadvantage when members of clergy and lay electors meet in Newport Cathedral to chose a candidate.

He is expected to face stiff opposition from the clergy who feel they want a local candidate when bishop Dominic Walker steps down after ten years later this month.
