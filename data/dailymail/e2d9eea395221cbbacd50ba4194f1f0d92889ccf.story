Victoria Beckham is touted as one of the world's most stylish women with a wardrobe full to the brim of designer garments, including each and every one of her own highly sought-after designs.

And now, the fashion designer is giving fans the chance to snap up a piece of her wardrobe - quite literally - as she is set to sell more than 600 items for charity.

Victoria has partnered with theoutnet.com to sell hundreds of her items of her clothing in aid of the charity, mothers2mothers.

Charity chic: Victoria Beckham will sell 600 items of her wardrobe on The Outnet to raise vital funds for mothers2mothers, a charity that educates on how to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies

In February this year, following an invitation from Vogue editor Anna Wintour and American Vogue to visit South Africa, Victoria met with mothers2mothers (m2m) founder Dr. Mitch Besser.

The charity trains, employs and empowers Mentor Mothers, who are mothers living with HIV, in order to educate them on how to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies and improve the health of women and their families.

Victoria was so moved by the experience that she wanted to do all she could to raise money and awareness.

Speaking about the cause, she said: ‘After spending just a few days with these remarkable women and learning more about the charity from Mitch, and his lovely wife Annie Lennox, I wanted to do as much as I could. It really was a life-changing experience; I’ve never experienced anything like it.’

Victoria felt that a sale of items from her wardrobe could be an incredibly powerful way to raise both money and awareness.

She told Grazia magazine: 'I have never met such strong women in my entire life. The work they are doing is nothing short of absolutely remarkable.'

With help from her mother and sister, Victoria carefully selected iconic pieces from her wardrobe - pieces from her early days with the Spice Girls, that she wore out with David Beckham, and from catwalk appearances, parties, awards shows and other events that have been heavily documented and photographed by the world’s press.

‘I laughed a lot when we were going through my wardrobe as the pieces hold so many happy memories for me, David and the children. A lot of the clothes have been specially designed for me by the most talented designers and I’ve loved wearing them, however I now feel it’s someone else’s turn to enjoy them,' she said.

'We approached The Outnet, part of The Net-a-Porter Group, as they have an incredible global reputation and are the perfect partner for us to build awareness and raise as much money as possible for mothers2mothers.'

So do you fancy the chance of snapping up a piece from the queen of fashion's closet? Interested customers must register online from August 5 for a chance to shop the collection.

As a special treat for Victoria Beckham fans and the e-tailer's customers, an auction of 10 of the most iconic pieces from Victoria’s wardrobe will be put up for sale in a ‘Going, Going, Gone’ reverse auction, where the starting price reduces by a fixed amount every five minutes.

Pieces such as the full length, white Dolce & Gabbana dress worn for the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards and the fluorescent yellow Roberto Cavalli gown worn for the pre-World Cup party in 2006 at David and Victoria Beckham’s country house will be part of the auction.

‘We are thrilled to be working with Victoria Beckham and her team on this very exciting charity event. From the start, The Outnet has defined itself by its strong relationships and collaborations with designers in luxury fashion and we are confident we can draw an enormous amount of interest for these iconic items and raise awareness for mothers2mothers,’ said the e-tailer's president.

Dr. Mitch Besser, Founder, mothers2mothers, said: ‘We are honored and extremely grateful to Victoria Beckham and The Outnet for their very generous support of mothers2mothers.

'The funds that are raised will help mothers2mothers’ Mentor Mothers reach even more HIV-positive mothers with critical health education and support, to stay healthy and protect their babies from HIV infection.

'HIV infections in children and maternal and infant deaths from AIDS are unnecessary and unacceptable. With the right education and empowerment, no baby should ever be born with HIV and no mother should die of AIDS. I’m sure everyone will have lots of fun shopping such a fashion treasure trove, and we’d like to thank those who do for joining us to eliminate HIV/AIDS in children and keep their mothers alive.'

The Victoria Beckham Charity Sale for mothers2mothers will be available exclusively at www.theoutnet.com/vbcharitysale from August 20th-25th, 2014.
