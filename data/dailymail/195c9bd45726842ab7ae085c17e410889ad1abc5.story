Since Google began in 1998, it has become the most popular search engine in the world, launched the ubiquitous Android software, and even offers its own superfast broadband network.

And along the way it has also spent billions on technology startups and websites.

A designer has created an infographic showing the firm’s most expensive acquisitions, and the strategy behind these purchases - as well as predicting which companies the tech giant could buy next.

The graphic (pictured) plots Google’s 10 most expensive acquisitions and the year the purchase was made. The cheapest, relatively speaking, was for  SkyBox Imaging, in June last year. In ninth place is Dropcam, bought for $555 million (£366 million) also in June 2014

The graphic was designed by Bedford-based website developers Aptitude.

It plots Google’s top 10 acquisitions, from the least to the most expensive, the year the purchase was made, and how the technology complements Google’s existing products.

Over the past 16 years, Google has spent $24.5 billion on 10 companies alone – and that doesn’t include smaller purchases, as well as investments.

The cheapest acquisition, relatively speaking, was for satellite imaging experts SkyBox Imaging, in June last year.

The deal was said to be worth $500 million (£330 million) and Aptitude believes Google bought the company to obtain accurate and up-to-date images for its Google Maps and Street View services.

In eight place on the top 10 list is Postini. This email and web security service cost Google $625 million (£413 million) in July 2007. ITA Software was Google’s seventh most expensive acquisition, at $700 million in July 2010. It develops software for the travel industry. At six, Google bought mobile platform AdMob in 2009

SpaceX announced today that is has raised $1 billion (£659 million in funding from Google and Fidelity Investments.

The firms own just under 10 per cent of Elon Musk's space exploration firm.

The deal values the company at $10bn.

Elon Musk said the money would go towards innovation in space transport and satellite manufacturing. 

The video monitoring and security company was bought to complement another of Google’s top 10 acquisitions - second place NestLabs.

NestLabs cost Google $3.2 billion (£2.1 billion) in January last year. The company makes smart themostats and smoke detectors and was set up by Tony Fadell, dubbed ‘the father of the iPod.’

Nest and Dropcam both help Google develop its strategy to connect people’s smart homes.

In eight place on the top 10 list is Postini. This email and web security service cost Google $625 million (£413 million) in July 2007.

Google had previously used the service to help secure its Gmail service.

In September 2011, Google announced plans to retire Postini, and many of the services were added to Google Apps from August 2012.

The service officially shutdown last year, but all existing customers will transition over by 15 March this year.

GPS navigation app Waze was Google’s fifth priciest purchase, in June 2013. Waze (app pictured) reports now automatically appear on Google Maps’ traffic layers. It cost Google $966 million (£637 million)

One of the most famous brands  Google has bought is YouTube. Bought back in 2006, the video sharing service now has more than 1 billion unique users each month, and more than 6 billion hours of video are watched a month on the site. It cost $1.65 billion (£1 million), but is said to make four times that a year

ITA Software was Google’s seventh most expensive acquisition, at $700 million in July 2010. It develops software for the travel and airline industry and was said to be ‘heavily relied’ upon by Google rival Bing.

At six, Google bought mobile advertising platform AdMob in late 2009, although the deal wasn't fully complete until early 2010. Apple was also said to have been interested in buying the platform for its iOS software.

The most expensive acquisition was made in 2011 for Motorola. Google was said to have wanted the firm’s patents. The deal cost  $12.5 billion (£8.2 billion), but in January 2014, Google sold it to Lenovo for $2.9 billion (£1.9 billion) - although did keep patents. NestLabs was in second place in 2014, worth $3.2 billion (£2 billion)

Google was said to have wanted Motorola's patents to help design its own range of Nexus phones and tablets. The Nexus 6 (pictured), for example, is designed and made by Motorola

Looking to the future, Aptitude predicts Google could make a play for either Spotify, Netflix or both. Spotify is the largest music subscription based music service in the market. Meanwhile, Netflix has 50 million subscribers, but could end up costing Google $23 billion (£15 billion), based on its market value

It cost Google $966 million (£637 million).

One of the most famous brands  Google has bought, and subsequently developed, is YouTube.

Bought back in 2006, the video sharing service now has more than 1 billion unique users each month, and shows more than 6 billion hours of video a month - almost an hour for every person on Earth.

It cost $1.65 billion (£1 million), but is said to make Google almost four times that a year in revenue.

Another advertising company on the list is DoubleClick.

Google bought the software, as well as its relationships with web publishers and other agencies as part of a deal said to have been worth $3.1 billion (£2 billion).

Google could use Spotify (pictured) to bolster its music offered from Google Play. Spotify's music industry contacts, and relationships in particular, could prove useful. Google owns Songza and Spotify could rival this

Aptitude believes Netflix (picutred) could expand Google's video services, alongside YouTube

But, the most expensive acquisition was made in 2011 for phone manufacturer Motorola.

Google was said to have wanted the firm’s patents to help design its own range of Nexus phones and tablets.

The Nexus 6, for example, is designed and made by Motorola. The deal cost Google $12.5 billion (£8.2 billion), but in January last year Google sold it to Lenovo - although did keep a number of the patents.

Looking to the future, Aptitude predicts Google could make a play for either Spotify, Netflix or both.

Spotify is the largest music subscription-based music service in the market and Google could use it to bolster its current music offerings from Google Play.

Google already owns Songza, and Spotify could rival this.

Meanwhile, Netflix, with its 50 million subscribers and mobile reach, could be another good fit for Google.

It is valued at $23 billion (£15 billion), which would make it Google’s most expensive acquisition to date.

During the two years prior to 2014, Google spent more on acquisitions than five of its closest rivals put together, including Apple and Facebook. 

Google services 3.5 billion searches per day which equates to 1.2 trillion searches a year worldwide.
