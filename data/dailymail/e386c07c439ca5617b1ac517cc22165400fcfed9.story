A drummer who lost his arm in a freak accident now has a second chance of achieving his dream after being transformed into a ‘cyborg’ musician.  

Jason Barnes lost his right arm below the elbow two years ago after receiving an electric shock while cleaning a vent hood in a restaurant.

Determined to carry on drumming, the student from Atlanta built his own prosthetic device using a brace and some springs that attached to his arm.

Jason Barnes, a drummer who lost his right arm in a freak accident, says he now has a chance of achieving his dream after being transformed into a 'cyborg' musician

The prosthesis uses a technique called electromyography to pick up on electrical signals in the upper arm muscles.

By tensing his biceps, Mr Barnes controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how tightly it grips the drumstick.

A second, autonomous drumstick was added to the robot arm. This stick is controlled by its own motor.

It also uses a microphone and an accelerometer to sense the rhythm Mr Barnes is playing, as well as music from musicians nearby.

A new complementary beat is then produced using an algorithm modelled on the jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. 

He could bang the drums by moving his elbow up and down, but couldn’t control the speed or bounce of the stick without a wrist or fingers.

Despite this, the device helped him enrol at the Atlanta Institute of Music and Media in Georgia, and it’s here that he met Professor Gil Weinberg.

Professor Weinberg hatched a plan to create a single-stick device with sensors that respond to Mr Barnes’ bicep muscles.

‘Now I can flex and send signals to a computer that tightens or loosens the stick and controls the rebound,’ Mr Barnes said.

The robotic drumming prosthesis has motors that power two drumsticks.

The
 first stick is controlled both physically by the musicians’ arms and 
electronically using electromyography (EMG) muscle sensors.

By tensing his biceps, Mr Barnes 
controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how
 tightly it grips the drumstick.

The other stick ‘listens’ to the music being played and improvises. This stick is controlled by its own motor.

It also uses a microphone and an accelerometer to sense the rhythm Mr Barnes is playing, as well as music from musicians nearby.

the jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. 

‘The second drumstick has a mind of its own,’ said Professor Weinberg, founding director of the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology.

‘The drummer essentially becomes a cyborg. It’s interesting to see him playing and improvising with part of his arm that he doesn’t totally control.’

Professor Weinberg had previously built a robotic percussionist and marimba player that use computer algorithms to improvise with human musicians.

But this prosthesis took his work a step further by adding a ‘musical brain’ into the second drum.

‘Jason can pull the robotic stick away from the drum when he wants to be fully in control,’ explained Professor Weinberg.

‘Or he can allow it to play on its own and be surprised and inspired by his own arm responding to his drumming.’

The new prosthetic has already given Mr Barnes capabilities he hasn’t had since before the amputation.

Professor Weinberg is now using a National Science Foundation grant to further develop the technology.

‘Music is very time sensitive. You can hear the difference between two strokes, even if they are a few milliseconds apart,’ said Professor Weinberg.

‘If we are able to use machine learning from Jason’s muscles to determine when he intends to drum and have the stick hit at that moment, both arms can be synchronised.’

He added that such robotic synchronisation technology could potentially be used in the future to control an embedded, mechanical third arm during time-sensitive operations.

For example, Professor Weinberg’s algorithms could be used to help astronauts or surgeons perform complex, physical tasks alongside robotic devices.

For Mr Barnes, the robot arm has transformed his skills. Because an embedded chip can control the speed of the drumsticks, the prosthesis can be programmed to play two sticks at a different rhythm.

It can also move the sticks faster than humanly possible.

‘I’ll bet a lot of metal drummers might be jealous of what I can do now,’ he said. ‘Speed is good. Faster is always better.’
