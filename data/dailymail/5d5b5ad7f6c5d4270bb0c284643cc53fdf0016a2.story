A 16-metre southern right whale, which has enthralled watchers off Sydney's beaches this week, has given birth to a 'big bouncing baby' and is spending the night with her newborn calf in Sydney harbour.

Experts have confirmed the birth after the mother and calf were first spotted off Dee Why Beach on Friday morning.

'Mother whale and not so tiny calf bunkered in for a chilly night in the safety of Sydney Harbour,' the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage then tweeted on Friday evening.Â

'We found her at 7.30 this morning and followed her and her calf down to South Curl Curl, before she moved out,' said Shona Lorigan from the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORRCA).

ORRCA tweeted a photo of the family on Friday morning to announce the arrival of the calf: 'We now have a big bouncing baby whale!!'

Its members had been on whale watch since dawn and had last sighted the southern right in the dying light of Thursday evening a mere 40m off Turimetta Beach.

She is assumed to have given birth to the calf in the flat, calm waters between there and Dee Why.

The mother and calf have since moved to the harbour and experts are still warning the public to steer clear of the family.

Sydney ferrys travelling from Manly to the city centre slowed down as they passed the mother and baby on Friday evening.

Passengers were overjoyed to catch a rare glimpse of the mother and baby whale, who were being watched over by a boat belonging to the Office of Environment & Heritage.

'A protective mother with a calf by her side will charge at people,' an ORRCA spokesperson told AAP.

On Thursday, speculation about the birthing whale drew crowds of onlookers down to Warriewood Beach to catch a glimpse of the mammal just beyond the breakers.

Just 50 metres off the shore, the mammal treated spectators to an up close look as it swam up and down the southern end of the coastline as well as lifting its barnacle-covered head to taste the sea breeze.

Southern right whales are known for their love of the shallows and can often be seen lolling in the waters just behind the surfline.

There are only about 5000 of the species left in the southern hemisphere.
