What began as a revitalizing trip to the spa for Laurie Anderson, renowned performance artist and wife of the late Lou Reed, suddenly transformed into a nightmare when she found herself trapped inside of a hyperbaric chamber for nearly two hours this week.

Anderson, 67, was at the Pure Flow spa, located West 15th Street near 8th Avenue, in New York. She was inside of an oxygen-filled blue hyperbaric tube and was attempting to get out of it when the zipper allegedly became stuck.

Anderson began shouting for help, but when no employees could hear her cries, she frantically texted a friend, who then called 911 for her.

By the time firefighters arrived on scene, Anderson had been able to free herself from the tube. She claimed to experience shortness of breath while trapped, but did not sustain any serious injuries.

According to reports, Anderson was not in the chamber for any longer than two hours.

Anderson is best known as an experimental artist, active in the New York scene since the 1970s. In 1981, her single 'O Superman' reached as high as #2 on Britain's national pop charts.

In 2008, Anderson married Lou Reed, guitarist for both the Velvet Underground as well as his own solo work. In his career, Reed penned classics such as 'Walk on the Wild Side', but more often challenged the musical status quo with albums such as 'Berlin' or 'Metal Machine Music.'

Reed passed away due to liver disease on October 27, 2013.Â

Visitors to the spa pay $100 per session to lay in the chambers and relax while pure oxygen enters the tank. This is purported to help with enhancing blood circulation and detoxifying.

The owner of the spa, Andrew Barile, told the New York Daily News that Anderson was inside of the chamber for 45 minutes before she fell asleep.

According to Barile, she must have been disoriented upon waking up, causing her to panic. He denied that any malfunction had taken place.

Anderson reportedly declined medical treatment at the scene, and went home.

As of Saturday morning, the Facebook page for Pure Flow Fitness was no longer accessible.

Representatives for Anderson did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment.
