The sound of my newborn son’s cries filtered through the floorboards, stinging my ears and piercing my heart. But I daren’t go to him. He was in the possessive grasp of my mother-in-law, who’d placed an exclusion zone of fierce grandmotherly love around him, barring all from going near.

‘Nonna’ was here, and she gripped Jonas to her chest and peered at me, her coal-black eyes filled with a direct challenge. It was a high-noon stand-off. ‘Mine’ she seemed to say, as she cooed at him.

So began one of the most painful weeks of my life, one which still smarts now when I think about it, and which pushed my relationship with my husband, Uli, to the brink. 

Devoted: Becky's son Jonas with his grandma Maria

To this day, I still feel hurt and resentful when I recall how my first weeks of motherhood were tainted by the interference of my Italian mother-in-law, Maria.

She made me feel superfluous, useless and inferior — that I was nothing more than a uterus that had delivered her first-born grandson. And a second-rate uterus, at that.

Maybe it was partly down to the clash of cultures. Nonna is from Bologna, and speaks barely a word of English, and I speak no Italian. Maybe it was also because she’d been widowed at 26: Uli, her youngest, was just 18 months old when his father was killed in a car crash, leaving her to raise her three children single-handedly.

It had left her fiercely proud of her family, as well as being very critical of their partners. From the ruinous state of my post-baby body to the way I held my son, I fell short in every department.

And Uli, the devoted mamma’s boy, seemed to accept her word on everything, excluding me as they gabbled in their own language. Whenever I hear friends complain about how little help they get from their in-laws, I want to shout how lucky they are.

I’d been a mother for just eight days when she came sweeping through the door of our home in Addlestone, Surrey, and literally wrenched Jonas from my arms.

Taken aback at her forthrightness, I tried to put it down to excitement. He was, after all, her first grandchild.

Yet as she clutched Jonas to her chest, ignoring me, my heart pounded in panic. Although logically, I knew he was safe, a new mother’s protective hormones turn her into a lioness. I would have fought and killed for Jonas. The trouble was, so would Nonna.

But instead of standing up to my mother-in-law, I went upstairs and wept. Looking back, I can’t believe I was so weak, so unassertive. I can only put it down to the shock I felt at having a domineering stranger barge into my life. 

First grandchild: The way Nonna (pictured) acted with baby Jonas made mother Becky feel panicked

This was her first visit to our home. Although I’d met her a few times in Italy, we’d never got beyond small-talk due to the language barrier. Although she’d never said it, I wondered if she blamed me for luring her son to another country.

Uli and I had met on a skiing trip in 2004. He was my instructor and we quickly recognised that our laughter on the slopes was the start of something more meaningful.

He moved to Britain a year later, and set up his own house refurbishment business. But it wasn’t until I gave birth that I realised the true character of my mother-in-law.

From the outset of her visit, she made it clear that ‘Nonna knows best’. And Uli did nothing to correct her.

She was constantly hurling ‘advice’ on everything from feeding to sleeping. Everything she did contradicted modern parenting advice: she put Jonas on his tummy to sleep and swaddled him in layers and layers of blankets. I even had to stop her feeding him camomile tea. Since when did a newborn baby need tea?

‘It’s just how they did things in her day,’ Uli said, as Maria stropped off. Of course, my husband ran after her to console her, rather than me.

More than 60 per cent of women say their relationship with their mother-in-law makes them stressed

Breastfeeding became my only solace, the only time Jonas was all mine. Even then, she’d stand so close that I felt inhibited and self-conscious. Once, she unexpectedly yanked up my top, revealing my postnatal belly. ‘Che pancia!’ she remarked (what a stomach!). It was utterly humiliating.

Upstairs, Uli and I hissed at each other. I was sick of being undermined and humiliated. In my worst moments, I wanted to run away with my baby.

Her week-long visit eventually ended, but the effect on Uli’s and my relationship reverberated for long after. Despite the tension, she would arrive at our door every three months without fail and stay for a week.

‘You can’t stop me seeing my mother!’ Uli would fume.

‘She can’t stop me from being a mother!’ I would retort.

I loved him, but there were times when I wondered if I’d be better off alone.

When I went on to give birth to two daughters — Daisy in 2010 and Anya in 2013 — I felt stronger and more in control. Yet still Nonna flew in to undermine me. I had to justify everything I did, from not putting salt in my children’s food, to not letting them ‘sweat out’ a fever to (gasp) letting them run around barefoot — a scandalous offence, as she believed colds are caused by floors, not viruses. 

Happy family: Nonna with her grandchildren Daisy, Anya and Jonas

During one of Nonna’s visits, I left her to give Daisy and Anya breakfast, while I took Jonas to school. I got back to find both children triumphantly sucking Oreo biscuits, having clearly ignored the cereal, toast and eggs on offer. She knew my views on this. Biscuits were a treat, not breakfast.

‘No biscotti!’ I said, at which she and the children just smirked conspiratorially.

It was only when my youngest, Anya, turned 18 months — the age Uli had been when his father died — that relations between us started to thaw. One day, exhausted and stressed, trying to juggle work, money and the family, I tried to imagine being responsible for these three little ones all on my own. How did Maria manage it, producing such a loving, loyal and well-adjusted son as Uli? 

Not so bad after all: Nonna with her grandson Jonas

Suddenly, the thought of Maria’s next visit didn’t feel quite so much as an invasion, but a welcome extra pair of loving hands. The children clearly adore their Nonna, and love chatting in her native language. And I’ve been making an effort to improve my Italian too, so I don’t feel so excluded.I’ve also stocked the biscuit barrel, am practising my vocabulary and am determined to grit my teeth.

Maybe we can start again.

Strong family ties: Nonna and baby Anya

I have no recollection of my father. He died far too soon and my mother sacrificed everything to give me, my brother and sister a good upbringing. It’s no surprise, then, that I will always love and admire her.

After Jonas was born, I couldn’t wait to share the experience with my mother. So  I couldn’t understand why Becky felt so threatened. That first visit was a nightmare. Nonna just wanted to get to know her grandson, but Becky couldn’t bear to share him.

Somehow she thought she was trying to steal him. She couldn’t see how ridiculous that was or disrespectful to my mother’s feelings. After all, she was only visiting us for a week.

I couldn’t help but feel that all this highlighted the massive cultural gaps between England and Italy. Back home, families are much stronger, there’s none of this ‘not interfering’ business.

I felt like a hostage, stuck in a field between two raging bulls.

It didn’t help that Mother and Becky didn’t speak the same language. Not only was I torn between two different cultures, I was constantly having to translate for them, too.

I love Becky — and my mother. I just hope, over time, they will learn to love each other.
