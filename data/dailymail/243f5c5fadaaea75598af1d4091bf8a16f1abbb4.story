Apple boss Tim Cook defended the iPhone giant today after it was revealed that the world’s most valuable company pays little or no tax on tens of billions of dollars stashed in offshore subsidiaries.

The company CEO faced a grilling from lawmakers in what was tagged as ‘Apple bashing day’ on Capitol Hill.

Insisting that Apple was an all-American company, Mr Cook brushed off criticism from a Senate panel, saying: ‘We estimate that the App Store has developed over 300,000 jobs in the U.S. None of that activity was there five years ago.’

He said the ‘design and development’ of Apple products remains focused on the United States and blasted America’s tax laws for not keeping pace with ‘the digital age.’

Defending Apple: Apple CEO Tim Cook testified on Capitol Hill in Washington, before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent subcommittee over the company's taxes

He was called to account in Washington after a 40-page report issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations threw a spotlight on Apple’s tax strategies.

The probe discovered that Apple employs a group of affiliate companies outside America to avoid paying tax.

One Apple satellite in Ireland earned $22 billion in 2011 – but reportedly paid just $10 million in taxes.

Apple’s arrangement has allowed it to pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $37 billion in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact that the average tax rate for countries in its main markets was 24 per cent last year, says the report.

‘Apple wasn’t satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,’ said subcommittee member Senator Carl Levin.

‘Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.’

Former presidential candidate John McCain said that while Apple claims to be the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer, it is also ‘among America’s largest tax avoiders.’

But Republican Senator Rand Paul insisted his fellow lawmakers should stop talking about ‘evil Apple.’

‘I’m very frustrated by these proceedings. They’re just doing what every company does. Bring me a company that tries to maximize their tax burden,’ he added.

Tax professor Richard Harvey told the panel he almost ‘fell off my chair’ when he heard Apple claim it didn’t use tax gimmicks. ‘This is going to be an Apple-bashing day,’ he added.

Apple uses five companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, says the report.

The companies are located at the same address in Cork and they share members of their boards of directors.

While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country.

That means the other three aren’t legally required to pay taxes in Ireland because they aren’t managed or controlled in that country, in Apple’s view.

Apple says it complies with the law and pays ‘an extraordinary amount’ of tax.

‘Apple does not use tax gimmicks,’ the company said in a statement. ‘And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this country and abroad,’ it added.

The spotlight on Apple’s tax strategy comes at a time of growing concern in London and Washington over the amount of revenue lost because of money stashed offshore.

Search giant Google, online retailer Amazon.com and coffee chain Starbucks have all come under criticism for arranging their affairs in a way that leaves them liable to low rates of tax on billions of pounds of overseas sales.

Microsoft has used ‘aggressive’ transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland and Singapore, in part to avoid taxes.

HP has used complex offshore loan transactions worth billions while using the money to run its US operations, according to the panel.

The subcommittee’s report estimates that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion in US taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using the tactic.

The Cupertino, California-based company paid $2.4 billion in taxes in 2011 and $6 billion in 2012.

US firms invested $30 billion in Ireland last year, more than in China and the rest of emerging Asia combined, according to the American Chamber of Commerce.

Getting a grilling: Tim Cook got aggressive as he testified over Apple's tax ethics and offshore subsidiaries

Meanwhile, Irish deputy prime 
minister Eamon Gilmore yesterday said it was not to blame for Apple 
Inc's low global tax payments and said they had no special rate with the
 company.

The Irish government, which has seen 
the luring of U.S. multinationals with low taxes as a key part of its 
economic policy since the 1960s, said its system was transparent and 
other countries were responsible if the tax rate paid by Apple was too 
low.

He told national broadcaster RTE: 
'They are issues that arise from the taxation systems in other 
jurisdictions, and that is an issue that has to be addressed first of 
all in those jurisdictions.'

The
 Senate subcommittee identified three subsidiaries that have no tax 
residency either in Ireland, where they are incorporated, or in the 
United States, where those companies are managed.

The
 main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores 
throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last 
five years, the report said.

The report said: 'Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple'.

The report says Apple capitalizes on a difference between U.S. and Irish rules regarding tax residency.

In Ireland, a company must be 
managed and controlled in the country to be a tax resident. Under U.S. 
law, a company is a tax resident of the country in which it was 
established.

Therefore, the Apple companies are not tax residents of Ireland nor of the U.S., since they were not incorporated in the U.S.

The strategies Apple uses are legal, and many other multinational corporations use similar tax techniques to avoid paying U.S. income taxes on profits they reap overseas.

However, the tactics have raised questions about loopholes in the U.S. tax code, lawmakers say.

The spotlight on Apple's tax strategy comes at a time of fevered debate in Washington over whether and how to raise revenues to help reduce the federal deficit.

Many Democrats complain that the government is missing out on collecting billions because companies are stashing profits abroad and avoiding taxes.

Republicans want to cut the corporate
 tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that U.S. 
companies make abroad. They say the move would encourage companies to 
invest at home.

As previously reported by The 
Associated Press, the overlooked asset that Apple has been building up 
could boost Apple's profits by as much as $10.5billion. However, Apple 
has been lobbying to change U.S. law so it can erase its tax liabilities
 in a less conspicuous fashion.

In its second quarter ended March 31,
 Apple posted its first profit decline in ten years. Net income was 
$9.5billion, or $10.09 a share, down 18 per cent from $11.6billion, or 
$12.30 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue increased 11 per 
cent, to $43.6billion.

Apple said in April that it will distribute $100 billion in cash to its shareholders by the end of 2015.

The company is expanding its share 
buyback program to $60billion, the largest buyback authorization in 
history, and is raising its quarterly dividend by 15 per cent, to $3.05 a
 share.

In Monday's regular trading session, Apple's stock rose $9.67, or 2.23 per cent, to close at $442.93.

President
 Barack Obama has proposed using the tax code to encourage companies to 
move jobs back to the U.S. and discourage them from shifting jobs 
abroad.

Amazon is one of the multinationals that have been criticized over its tax affairs

Apple is the latest multinational to be hit by tax avoidance accusations. 

Investigations are currently underway in both the U.S. and UK into corporations who have a turnover of billions but pay a fraction of that in taxes. 

In the UK, Google was accused of doing evil' by a Parliamentary committee after MPs claimed the internet giant by using 'devious, calculated and unethical' trucks to minimize its liabilities. 

It paid just $11 million in corporation tax last year despite having a UK turnover of $4.5 billion. 

Elsewhere, Amazon could be investigated by the UK Public Accounts Committee after paying just $3.7 million in corporation tax on UK sales of $485 million last year. 

But the Seattle-based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount, claiming the UK sales were actually more than $6 billion.

Starbucks was one of the first companies to be accused of tax avoidance when the row erupted last year. 

It has since agreed to pay $30 million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009.

France has also said it will fight tax avoidance and President Francois Hollande has called for the 'eradication' of tax havens. 

He told French banks last month that they must declare any foreign subsidiaries each year as he presented a draft law drawn up in response to the country's recent tax scandal.
