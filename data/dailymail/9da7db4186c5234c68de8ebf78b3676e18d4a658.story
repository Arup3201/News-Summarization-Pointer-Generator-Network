Mothers are ‘worth less’ to employers in the City than men, Nigel Farage claimed today.

The Ukip leader suggested women who take time off to have children are paid less because they lose contact with their client base and struggle to succeed when they return to work.

Hours after making the controversial remarks, Mr Farage complained it was 'not very nice' being clobbered over the head with a placard as he tried to enter push his way through an angry protest in Kent.

Addressing an audience 
in the City this morning, Mr Farage insisted there is no sex 
discrimination in financial services because childless women do ‘as well
 or better than men’.

In
 highly-controversial remarks, Mr Farage – who has previously defended 
the City’s culture of drinking and strip clubs – said women can succeed 
in the industry as long as they are willing to ‘sacrifice the family 
life’.

He also rejected the idea of becoming a stay-at-home father who allowed his wife to pursue a career.

But hours later he was physically attacked as he tried to attend an event in Margate in Kent.

He said the incident, outside a hotel, was worse than when an angry mob blockaded him in an Edibnurgh pub last year.

'In
 Edinburgh they cane along to make a noise. Here they came to bar me 
from actually physically entering this hotel, and with intent to 
physically hurt me,' he told ITV Meridian.

'So that's not very nice. I didn't like it but it is not going to stop me.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said women who take time off to have children lose their client base and become less valuable to employers

ON LAPDANCING‘Lap
 dancing? Don’t have the time these days, but I used to go to them. Like
 it or not, they are a fact of life. You are talking about normal 
behaviour there. Everyone does it... Prostitution and lap dancing are not the same thing, they can be but not usually.'

ON DRINKING'I’ll tell you something. I work an 18 hour day most days and I think I’m entitled at lunchtime to a pint.'

ON MARGARET THATCHER'I
 cannot believe that a young Margaret Thatcher leaving Oxford today 
would join the Conservative party led by John Major. I think she’d come 
and get involved in UKIP.'

ON EU PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY'You have the charisma of a damp rag, and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk. And the question that I want to ask... that we're all going to ask, is "Who are you ?". I'd never heard of you. Nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.'

ON ENOCH POWELL'Enoch Powell was an extraordinary fellow. I admired him for having the guts to talk about an issue that seemed to be to be really rather important – immigration, society, how do we want to live in this country.'

Speaking in London this morning, Mr Farage rejected the idea that the 
City is still an ‘old boys’ although he admitted that in the 1980s it 
was a ‘deeply sexist place’.

But he insisted the culture had changed and women could be successful – provided they did not have children.

Mr Farage said: ‘You are as valuable as the client base that sticks with you and will move with you.

‘In many, many cases, women make different choices in life than what men make simply for biological reasons.

‘And
 if a woman has a client base, has a child and takes two or three years 
off work, she is worth far less to the employer when she comes back than
 when she went away because her client base will not have stuck rigidly 
to her.’

Mr Farage said 
there was no ‘discrimination against women at all’ in the City, adding: 
‘Young, able women who are prepared to sacrifice the family life and 
stick to their career will do as well or better than men.'

While growing numbers of men were choosing to stay-at-home to allow partners to return to work, Mr Farage added: ‘I have to admit I was never going to be one of them myself.'

Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said Mr Farage was ‘downright wrong’.

She added: ‘There’s not a single business or public service in this country which would still have the lights on if women weren’t there at work.

‘And yes, women do an important role in the home as well, not least because men don’t share equally in the home and therefore it falls to women.

‘But women are vital in their work and I think that is an  affront to women in this country and I just can’t believe that he’s said that.’ 

Kirsty Ayre, a partner at the international law firm Pinsent Masons, said: ‘These remarks reflect an incredibly narrow  view of worth.’

She added: ‘The days when you evaluate someone’s contribution based on their book of contacts are long gone and employers risk losing out  on top talent if that is their attitude.’

Mr Farage also hit back at attacks on 
Ukip, after he suspended a councillor who blamed the Christmas and New 
Year floods on David Cameron’s decision to legalise gay marriage.

David
 Silvester claimed last week that the country had been ‘beset by storms’
 because the Prime Minister had acted ‘arrogantly against the Gospel’ by
 passing same-sex marriage laws.

Ukip’s
 leadership had originally refused to discipline Mr Silvester, 73, a 
town councillor in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, saying that everyone 
was entitled to their religious views.

But he was finally suspended yesterday afternoon after defying a request not to do further interviews on his beliefs.

However,
 Mr Farage today suggested that the remarks had only become a story 
after Mr Silvester joined Ukip from the Tory party, where he had 
previously aired similar views.

Women who 'sacrifice' family life can still be successful in the financial sector, Mr Farage said

Speaking
 in a question-and-answer session in the City, the Ukip leader said: 'I 
think it is very interesting that, when Mr Silvester was saying these 
things in 2012 and 2013 as a Conservative town councillor in Henley, it 
was not a news story. But suddenly he switches to Ukip and continues the
 same thing and gets on the national news.

'I
 think that shows you and tells you all you need to know. The 
establishment, the status quo, the big businesses, the big Eurocrats and
 our three so-called main political parties are scared witless by what 
Ukip is doing because we are striking a chord not just for ordinary 
people but for many elements in the business community as well.

'They will try to do whatever they can to shoot us down.'

Mr Silvester angered party bosses by going on local radio to say that being gay was a ‘spiritual disease’ which can be healed.
