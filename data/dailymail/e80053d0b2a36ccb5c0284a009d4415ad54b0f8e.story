A millionaire businessman bled to death after waiting five hours for surgery at a hospital run by the scandal-hit NHS in Wales.

Doctors failed to spot that Malcolm Green, 82, was slowly bleeding to death internally after undergoing an operation.

An inquest heard Mr Green was ‘happy and chatting’ after having successful surgery for colon cancer.

Malcolm Green (pictured with his wife, Janet, after receiving an MBE), 82, bled to death after surgery to remove a tumour in his bowel in June 2012

But as he recovered from the operation he was seen four times by doctors and nurses who realised his blood pressure was falling.

His condition suddenly deteriorated and he was taken back to an emergency ward 12 hours after his blood pressure first began to drop.

But Mr Green had to wait for a further five hours before the operation was carried out.

By that time, doctors were unable to save Mr Green who was awarded an MBE for his charity work just months before his tragic death.

His company, Greens Motors in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, is the oldest Land Rover dealership in the world and he was still working in the days before going into hospital.

Coroner's officer Jeremy Davies said: ‘Malcolm Green was in good general health, fit, playing golf and still working.

Surgeons managed to remove Mr Green's tumour but staff at Withybush General Hospital, in Haverfordwest, failed to notice that he was bleeding internally after the operation

‘He had surgery on a colon tumour and it was successfully removed.’

Mr Green was due to have keyhole surgery at Withybush General Hospital in Haverfordwest but had open surgery instead in June 2012.

The inquest heard in the early hours following the operation nurse, Stephanie Reynolds discovered his blood pressure had dropped.

Ms Reynolds said she was caring for Mr Green along with another nurse and two healthcare assistants.

The team of four was looking after a total of 30 patients that evening.

Ms Reynolds said: ‘Mr Green's blood pressure fell but I didn't think it was that low.’

Surgeon Dr Otumeluke Umughele (pictured) visited Mr Green after the surgery and said he would call on him again but was not concerned about his health

Dr Ian Lane, who put him on fluids, told the inquest: ‘It seemed unlikely it was a bleed because he was alert, chatty and very co-operative.

‘When I examined him a second time his condition had improved.’

Dr Lane added that the hospital had been busy with greater pressure than usual during the night.

Medical staff expressed no further concerns about Mr Green and he was visited by his surgeon Dr Otumeluke Umughele who said he would call to see him again later.

The inquest in Milford Haven heard within an hour Mr Green's condition deteriorated and he lost unconsciousness.

He was taken to an emergency ward and prepared for surgery but the inquest heard the operation did not go ahead for another five hours.

The hearing was told that when the operation went ahead a large amount of clotted blood was found in his abdomen.

Mr Green never recovered from the surgery and died of multiple organ failure caused by a bleeding vessel three days later.

The inquest heard staff at the 311-bed district general hospital were busier than usual on the night of 27 June 2012.

Father-of-two Mr Green was well known throughout the UK as managing director of Green's Motors for more than 50 years.

The company was established 160 years ago, originally dealing in bicycles before the car was invented.

He helped to raise tens of thousands of pounds for good causes in Haverfordwest.

His business and family home were just a mile away from the hospital where he died with his wife, Janet, at his bedside.

After the surgery, staff at the hospital were initially happy with Mr Green's progress as he was alert and chatty. However, 12 hours after the operation he lost consciousness and was moved to an emergency ward where he was forced to wait another five hours for further surgery

Dr Sue Fish, medical director for the health board, said: 'Delivering safe care for our patients is at the centre of everything we do and we sincerely apologise to the family of Mr Green that on this occasion the level of care fell below the acceptable level.

'We take these issues very seriously and a full internal investigation has been carried out and shared with the family.

'We await the coroner’s conclusion and we have already put in place the necessary steps to ensure these failings do not happen again including reminding doctors and nursing staff of the importance of accurate record keeping.'

Just two weeks ago Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs the state of the NHS in Wales ‘is a scandal’.

By the time Mr Green was taken back to surgery, medics were unable to save him and he died a few days later

Mr Cameron hit out at the Labour-run Welsh government over the performance of the health service in Wales.

During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘Frankly what we have in our NHS in Wales is a scandal, and it's a scandal that's entirely the responsibility of the Labour party who are running the Welsh Assembly Government.

‘They made the decision to cut NHS spending by eight per cent in Wales, as a result, they have not met an A&E target since 2009.’

The inquest into Mr Green's death is ongoing.
