A Christmas miracle took place at an animal shelter when a puppy declared stillborn sprang to life 45 minutes later.

Vets at the Aurora Animal Shelter in Colorado were astonished by the event, which was described as ‘impossible’.

The heartwarming story begins on Christmas Eve, when a small dog in labor was brought to the front desk.

Christmas miracle: Aurora Animal Shelter staff hold the newborn puppy and its mother

Veterinarian Dr Nicole Bartley wrote on the shelter’s Facebook page: ‘A quick exam showed that the puppy she was trying to have was far too large to fit. She needed an emergency C-section and she needed it NOW. It was obvious the puppy had been stuck for a long time.

‘There was a lot of infection and very little chance for the puppy. However, we always try to save puppies and kittens born by C-section and the veterinary technicians went to work, but the puppy never breathed, never moved.’

What happened next left the staff at the shelter in a state of disbelief.

Remarkable: The puppy didn't respond to vets at first, but eventually sprang to life

The puppy was assumed to be dead and the technicians worked to clear the mother of infection, then they heard a startling sound.

Dr Bartley explained that as they stirred the mother from anesthesia 45 minutes later a crying noise began emanating from the blanket the puppy was wrapped in.

She added: ‘It was alive! And crying for its mama! It should not have been possible for that puppy to be alive that much later when we couldn’t get it to respond right away.’

Aww-some: The tiny puppy began crying for its mother leaving vets in a state of disbelief

Staff decided that there was only one possible name for the puppy – Miracle.

After the dramatic birth the mother and Miracle spent the night under close observation and have now gone into foster care, the Facebook post explained.

As Gary Beasley commented, it’s not quite a Miracle on 34th Street, ‘but it’ll do’.
