Hamilton, who raced in the Renault Clio Cup in 2011 and 2012, said: ‘I am incredibly excited to be racing in BTCC with AmD Tuning this year.

‘BTCC is the top national motorsport series here in the UK and having the opportunity to race at that level is the biggest challenge I’ve taken on in my career to date.

‘I’m coming into the championship with a lot to learn and my expectations are to develop as a driver as my programme across the season progresses.’

Hamilton was trackside for both his elder brother’s Formula One world championship triumphs in Brazil in 2008 and last year in Abu Dhabi.

‘Whilst I’m aiming to improve as a driver, I’m also hoping to inspire others to strive for their own personal goals, whatever their situation in life,’ added Hamilton.

‘Anyone can exceed expectations in one way or another and I hope to prove that when I race alongside, not just able-bodied drivers, but the best Touring Car drivers in the UK.’

Cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.

Specifically, cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles.

The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth.

The main symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life.

They are: Muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, balance and co-ordination problems.

Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected.
