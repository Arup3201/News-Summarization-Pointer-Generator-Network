Jackie Kennedy’s socialite sister has said that she disapproves of her daughter in law joining the cast of the Real Housewives of New York.

Lee Radziwill, Jackie’s younger sister, has protected her privacy for years but the family name is being brought back into the public sphere by her now-dead son’s widow, Carole Radziwill, who is now in her second season on the reality show.

Carole became a member of the Radziwill family- and the Kennedy clan by extension- when she married Lee’s son Anthony in 1994.

Lee Radziwill ‘guards her privacy with a vengeance and has expressed her disappointment that Carole used the Radzwill name on The Real Housewives of New York,’ a friend told Radar.

Gone young: 'Tony' Radziwill, seen with his mother in 1990, died in 1999 after a five-year battle with cancer

She and ‘Tony’ were extremely close with his cousin John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn, who became Carole’s best friend.

Carole suffered immense tragedy in the summer of 1999 when both JFK Jr and Carolyn died in a plane crash, and then Tony died after a battle with a rare form of testicular cancer less than a month later.

She achieved fame six years later with a best-selling memoir about her grief, called What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship and Love, but now has re-emerged- to the apparent dismay of her late husband’s mother.

‘It’s just tacky. Lee believes Tony never would have wanted Carole to be a part of reality television and she can’t quite grasp why anyone would want to be a on a television show with women fighting and getting drunk,’ an unidentified source close to the 80-year-old socialite told Radar.

‘Fortunately, she lives in Paris and that puts some distance between her and the sensational headlines.’

Carole
 Radziwill, 50, has spoken about her on the show but has admitted in 
previous interviews that they are not particularly close anymore.

‘I don’t see her as much as I’d like,’ Carole told The Daily Beast.

'The thing about Lee is that not only is she an unbelievably beautiful woman, she's one of the most curious women I've ever met.

Back in the day: Lee Radziwill's husband was the Prince of Poland, making her son Anthony and his wife Carole (seen together in the mid-1990s before his death in 1999) both a Prince and Princess respectively

Marrying into the family: Carole married Tony in 1994 in East Hampton, making her a part of the extended Kennedy clan- and Caroline Kennedy carried her wedding train

Tragic: Tony was very close with his cousin John F. Kennedy Jr and Carole had become best friends with his wife Carolyn Bessette, making their 1999 death even harder to bare

‘I don't think she would understand reality TV, but if you look at her life, she was always doing something interesting and different. She was a decorator, she was even an actress on stage for a while, she worked in fashion, she had so many different interests and lives and careers. So I think she would be bemused.’

Carole has made it clear that she 
joined the show after initial hesitation, but the former journalist 
decided to sign on out of an anthropological interest- not to mention a 
paycheck.

‘I am not 
terribly motivated by money. I am more motivated by experiences, and 
this seemed like an interesting new experience. But at the end of the 
day, I am also a single girl with bills. And I thought maybe it might 
help sell some books,’ she told MailOnline.

One of those books would be her upcoming novel- The Widow’s Guide to Sex and Dating- comes out next month.
