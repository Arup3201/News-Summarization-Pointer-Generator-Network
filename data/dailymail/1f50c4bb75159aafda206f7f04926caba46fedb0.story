Unsightly speakers with trailing wires are an unwelcome feature of many living rooms.

But now there is an alternative that claims to be 'invisible' and able to disappear into its surroundings as the main bulk of the speaker is completely transparent.

A U.S. firm has developed an ultra-thin clear acrylic speaker that will cost $350 (£215) – which is a cheaper alternative to embedding speakers into walls and does not require DIY skills either.

The ‘invisible’ Clio speaker can sit directly in front of a TV without obscuring a person’s view and works with any Bluetooth tablet or smartphone.

It uses a 1mm thin sheet of acrylic to create the sound and is wireless.

Traditional speakers generate sound in one direction but the curved surface of the Clio model emits sound in multiple directions, according to ClearView Audio of Boston in Massachusetts.

There is no grill or cover between the speaker and your ears – so that the sound is clearer than ever, it said.

The speaker weighs 900 grams and is approximately nine inches tall (23cm) and 12 inches (30cm) wide.

It will go on sale next month in three base colours - dark bronze, silver or charcoal. The first deliveries are expected to be shipped in May - including to the UK - and can be ordered from the company's website.

Vice President of Marketing, Gene D'Ovidio, 64, said: ‘The original idea was to create a speaker from the motion of a curved membrane.

‘But the idea of a clear membrane emerged from a desire to make a speaker that would fit in front of a TV or any other monitor that would have to be clear.

‘We were driven by the desire to eliminate unattractive "black boxes" from the interior design of a home or office - we believe that speakers should be heard and not seen.'

Mr D'Ovidio said that the company wants to give consumers the same experience if walking into a purposely designed room with speakers embedded in walls and ceilings, at a fraction of the cost.

The technology used to make the sound, which is called Edge Motion, is patented by the company.

The speaker weighs 900 grams and is approximately nine inches tall (23cm) and 12 inches (30cm) wide. The base comes in three colours to help it blend n further with the decor of a room

Traditional cone speakers push sound from behind, but vibrations are driven along the outside of the clear glass' thin membrane in the Clio speaker.

Mr D'Ovidio explained that this motion pushes air molecules to listeners’ ears and the frequency of that is 'the sound of music'.

He said that engineers from different disciplines, including electrical, computer, mechanical as well as material scientists and industrial designers, have worked together to create the product.
