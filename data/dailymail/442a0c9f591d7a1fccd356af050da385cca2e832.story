Dawood Ibrahim is counting his blessings after his alarm clock failed to work yesterday - because it meant he overslept and avoided getting caught up in the massacre at his school in Pakistan.

The 15-year-old is now the only member of class 9 left at the Army Public School in Peshawar after terrorists slaughtered every one of his classmates.

His story came to light after a tweet appeared that read 'there is no class 9 in APS anymore... Dawood, 15, is the only survivor'.

Tragic: Dawood Ibrahim is the only member of class 9 left. He didn't go to school on the morning of the attack because his alarm didn't go off 

His older brother, Sufyan Ibrahim, confirmed his remarkable escape to The Express Tribune of Pakistan.

He said: 'It was fate. No one from his class survived. Every single one of them was killed.'

It's believed that his class may have been murdered by one of the gunmen detonating a suicide vest.

Dawood spent yesterday attending funerals, his brother added - having been at a wedding the night before.

Meanwhile, horrifying accounts from child survivors of the Pakistan school massacre continued to emerge - including one who was sprayed with the 'warm blood and flesh' of his friends as gunmen opened fire during a first-aid class.

Their horrendous ordeals came as the first devastating images emerged today of the blood-soaked classrooms where 132 innocent children and nine teachers were massacred by the Taliban at an army-run school in Peshawar.

Ehsan Elahi, 13, told how he survived by playing dead after being shot twice in the arm as militants 'sprayed bullets like hell' into his class, turning the room into a 'pool of blood and death'.

Speaking to MailOnline from his hospital bed, the eight-grade pupil said he was being taught first aid by army instructors in the main hall when he heard the sound of gunfire drawing nearer.

He said: 'Our teachers and instructors asked us to calm down but the sound of the bullets started came closer and closer.

'In the next minute, the glass of windows and doors of the hall smashed with bullets. Some people started kicking the hall doors.'

He said that situation created panic among the 100 students in the hall.

He said: 'Everybody was trying to find a place to hide but there was not such places in the hall. 

'The students were crying and weeping. 

'There were only chairs and benches to hide behind in the hall. I jumped behind a bench and laid on the ground.' 

He said the attackers burst in and started 'spraying bullets like hell'.

Elahi continued: 'I saw army instructors falling on the ground first. I saw many of my friends getting bullets on their heads, chests, arms and legs right in front of me. 

'Their body parts and blood were flying like small pieces of cotton in the class room.

'Warm blood and flesh of my friends fell on my face and other parts of my body. It was horrible. 

'They kept on firing bullets for at least 10 minutes and then stopped. It was a pause of a maximum of a minute. 

'Next moment, they started spraying bullets again towards those who were crying with pain or moving. I also received two bullets on my right arm.  

'I did not cry because it meant death': Ehsan Elahi survived by playing dead after being shot twice in the arm when Taliban militants stormed his first-aid class, massacring his friends and army instructors 

'Blood, flesh and body parts were scattered every where': Ehsan Elahi (centre) saw the 'lifeless faces of his friends' as he fled the hall during the massacre

'I wanted to cry with my full voice but I held my pain and did not cry because it meant death.'

Elahi explained how his life was eventually saved by Pakistani soldiers.

He said: 'They were not ready to leave alive even a single person present in the hall. After around 15 minutes, we heard some bullets shots from outside. 

'I think army soldiers reached the school by that time and they fired those bullets. This diverted the attention of the attackers. 

'They ran out from the hall. But, I did not move or cried for next 10 minutes unless army men came to rescue us. 

Devastation: Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up during a nine-hour rampage 

Shocking: The scene of the final gun battle between the jihadists and Pakistani soldiers

Harrowing: A blood-splattered doorway leading to an auditorium at the school in Peshawar, with spectacles on the floor belonging to one of the victims of the massacre

'The hall has turned to pool of blood and death. Human blood, flesh and body parts were scattered every where. 

'I saw lifeless faces of many of my friends when I was leaving the hall. Their faces are still in front of my eyes.'

Another pupil told how he watched his female teacher being burned alive as she courageously stood in the path of the terrorists and told her children to run for their lives.

Afsha Ahmed, 24, confronted the marauding gunmen when they burst into her classroom and told them: 'You can only kill my students over my dead body.'  

The militants doused her with petrol and set her alight, but she still mustered the strength to beckon her pupils to flee.

One of her students, 15-year-old Irfan Ullah, wept as he recalled her incredible bravery.

It is believed Mrs Kazi (right) was targeted because she's married to a retired army colonel, Kazi Javaid

He said: 'She was a hero, so brave. She jumped up and stood between us and the terrorists before they could target us.

'She warned them: "You can only kill them over my dead body". I remember her last words - she said: "I won't see my students lying in blood on the floor".'

Irfan, who suffered serious injuries to his chest and stomach in the chaos, said he hoped Mrs Ahmed would forgive him for not trying to protect her and for any mistakes he ever made in class.

'I felt so selfish as we ran away to safe our lives instead of trying to save our teacher who sacrificed her life for our better tomorrow,' he added. 

Meanwhile, horrifying pictures have revealed the carnage wrought by seven extremist gunmen who sprayed children with bullets as they sat receiving first aid tuition and exploded suicide bombs in a room of 60 pupils. 

As the Pakistani city of Peshawar began the harrowing process of conducting mass funerals, the family of a teacher torched alive in front of her class gathered to say funeral prayers. 

Tahira Kazi, the principal of the Army Public School and College in Peshawar, was set on fire by jihadists who slaughtered so many.

It is believed she was targeted because she is married to a retired army colonel, Kazi Zafrullah. The picture obtained by MailOnline shows her standing proudly next to a student believed to be her son.

Today the Pakistani prime minister lifted a moratorium on the death penalty, as the school reopened to reveal the terrifying aftermath of the atrocity, including Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up.

The masscre led to calls for the death penalty to be restored. 'It was decided that this moratorium should be lifted. The prime minister approved,' said government spokesman Mohiuddin Wan, referring to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's approval of the decision by a ministerial committee.
