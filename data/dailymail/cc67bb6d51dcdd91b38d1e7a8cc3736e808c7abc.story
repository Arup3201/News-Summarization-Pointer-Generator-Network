Andy Murray's surge of form has seen him reach London's season-end finale – but it also means that mum Judy may have to survive several more weeks in Strictly Come Dancing for her son to watch her in person.

Family loyalties aside, there was no doubt that he would trade the former for the latter, after he elegantly swept aside Grigor Dimitrov on Thursday to confirm his place in next month's eight-man field in the Barclays ATP World Finals.

His commitments at the O2 Arena, plus the minimum of a late quarter final on Saturday at the Paris Masters, mean that he will almost certainly miss out on the filial duty of watching Britain's Fed Cup captain on the dancefloor for at least the next two Saturdays.

It is a price he is more than willing to pay for the deep satisfaction of having convincingly hauled himself into the elite London event from a position of twelfth two months ago.

'I am assuming I'm not going to be there for now. It would probably be quite a tough watch for me,' he said, smiling, after an impressive 6-3 6-3 victory that suggested he is back to his best. 'There's a possibility I could go if I'm back but if it's on a Saturday I could be playing the next day.

'It's been a long six weeks so I'm quite looking forward to getting back and being in my own bed and my home for quite a few days, rather than watching some very average dancing.'

Before speaking fondly of his mother's efforts to master things like the Charleston, Murray reflected on the jolt that he received after losing in the US Open quarter finals and finding himself out of the top 10 for the first time since 2008, and how it fired him.

After so impressively dismissing Dimitrov he wrote 'Bad Year' under his signature on the lens of the courtside camera, a riposte to those who have underestimated him in 2014.

It would be hard to find any sensible observer who has described him as having had a 'bad' year (just as it would be difficult to unearth anyone sensible who 'wrote off' Roger Federer after 2012) but until late September it was assuredly a difficult season by Murray's high standards.

He has responded admirably, and matters could improve further if he were to beat either Novak Djokovic in Friday's match.

'When I dropped out of the top ten that kind of hit me a little bit,' he said. 'I thought I needed to get back to winning tournaments, I shouldn't be having a top four player in the world schedule right now if I want to get back up to the top. It was time to start winning again, get my head down and start to win the less glamorous events.

'There's been a lot of 'are the top four being broken up?' 'am I still part of that conversation?'. Next year I hope I can go a bit further in the Slams, I was consistent in the Slams (he reached the quarters or better) but didn't do as well as I would have liked there, but those guys above me are great players.

'Writing 'bad year' wasn't a jibe, it was a bit of fun. It's been a hard year, a tough year, but not a bad year. I've had to dig deep at the end of it to salvage it, if you like. Coming back from surgery (on his back twelve months ago) in an individual sport is not easy. I would have signed up to be in this position twelve months ago.'

It was his 58th win of 2014, with some of the most fluent tennis he can produce in making Dimitrov, the man who upset him at Wimbledon, look very ordinary.

His ease of movement –always an indicator of his form - was slightly superior to that which has been seen from his mother on the dancefloor, although it is easy to see where he gets his powers of application from, judging by her improvement.

'She's loved doing it,' he said of Judy. ' I think what she's found quite hard is the performing. I think she's concentrating so hard on doing the dance correctly and moving her feet in the right way and not forgetting stuff that she maybe doesn't show that she's enjoying it that much.

'But from what she's said to me it's been the best fun she's had in such a long time, learning something new. Her partner (Anton Du Beke) has been loads of fun. But for her it's tough on the body. She's doing six hours of dancing three days a week to get ready and then they do the show.

'Being in heels and stuff, she doesn't normally wear them, she's normally in trainers. So for her it's quite tough physically which I don't think she was really expecting. I've only seen two of the dances but she's having a good time, that's the most important thing. Maybe if I was playing on the Monday at the O2 there's a possibility I could go.'
