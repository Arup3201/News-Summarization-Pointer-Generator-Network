A gay couple were confronted by a security guard and asked to leave a mall for holding hands and kissing over the weekend.

Daniel Chesmore, 21, and Jose Guzman, 24, recorded a security guard at the Roseville mall in Sacramento, California telling them: 'If you continue to kiss, you will be asked to leave the mall. Period.'

Guzman said afterwards: 'I feel like we’re always treated differently because we’re gay. It makes me sad.'

The voice, allegedly of the security guard, on the recording continues: 'I counted you guys kissing 25 times.'

The security guard told the couple, who are teachers at an elementary school in Oakland, California, that he would eject anyone for such public displays of affection.

The mall backed up the guard, telling Fox40 that anyone who violates the mall's code of conduct will be asked to leave. 

However, Fox found nothing in the code of conduct that prohibits public displays of affection.

When Fox went to the Westfield 
Galleria, it spotted dozens of heterosexual couples openly being 
affectionate with one and other. Not one couple it witnessed was asked 
to leave.

In an interview after the incident, Chesmore said: 'In a perfect world, there would be no difference in treatment between straight couples and gay couples.'

'It makes me feel like no matter what I do in society, I will always be different.'
