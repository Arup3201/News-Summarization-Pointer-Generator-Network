Kung-fu legend Jackie Chan has been accused of shameless flirting after a bizarre public cheek-rub with a famous Chinese singer who is alleged to have had an affair with a former communist party leader.

The actor, 59, was pictured nuzzling the neck of Song Zuying after walking up to greet the 47-year-old singer during a meeting of the Chinese people's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing.

But what Chan dismissed as an innocent gesture prompted a flurry of condemnation after photographs of the encounter surfaced online.

Critics were quick to point out that Chan was attending the country's top political advisory body and  not going to a night club or on a date.

But the star told the South China Morning Post: 'That day, I was behind her. She turned her head, saw me and said 'Oh, it's you.

'I'm always like this. Only this time it was photographed and published. It's a lot of fuss over nothing. This is a very normal thing.'

Zuying, one of China's most famous singers, is rumoured to have had an affair with former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin while both were married to other people. She later divorced her husband.

Some have claimed Jiang was responsible for the success of her career. Curiously in 2009 she was made a non-combatant Rear Admiral in the Chinese Navy.

Chan, famous for performing all his own stunts in over 150 films, was made a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, last year.
