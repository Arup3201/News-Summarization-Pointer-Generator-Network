They say motherhood is the hardest job in the world, and judging by a child's perception of the perfect mum, it's easy to see why.

According to Britain's children, the perfect mother is one third Davina McCall, a quarter JK Rowling and a quarter Mary Berry with sprinklings of Myleene Klass, Darcey Bussell and Beyonce mixed in.

A poll of children revealed mums should hug and kiss like Davina on Got to Dance, tell stories like the Harry Potter novelist and belt out ballads like Beyonce.

The perfect mum: Britain's children have cast their votes and mother's should hug like Davina McCall and be as pretty as Myleene Klass

The survey of five to 11-year-olds also 
found the ideal mother should be able to bake cakes like Mary Berry, be 
as pretty as Myleene Klass and dance like ballerina turned Strictly 
judge Darcy Bussell.

However, the majority of the children surveyed believe their mother is already all of these things and more.

More than half (52 per cent) thought mum rocks fashion better than Victoria Beckham, a similar number (53 per cent) believe their motheris smarter than Einstein and nearly three-quarters (72 per cent) said their parent would make a better prime Minster than David Cameron.

Less than one in four children (23 per cent) said they would like their mum to be famous, but only if she was The Queen.

Top reasons included because The Queen makes all the rules (32 per cent), it would make me them a prince or princess (12 per cent) or she lives in a palace (eight per cent).

A spokesman for Littlewoods.com who carried out the survey, said: 'I am sure mums 
everywhere will be breathing a sigh of relief to learn its the simple 
things like baking cakes and telling good bedtime stories that keep kids
 happy, as opposed to unachievable ideals.'

Talents: The ideal mother should also be able to read like JK Rowling and sing like Beyonce
