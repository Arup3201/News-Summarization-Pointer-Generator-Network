No longer one of the most natural impulses known to humanity, parenting has become fraught with competitiveness, fads and sky-high levels of anxiety. 

And while it's a common belief that mother knows best, these latest trends and crazes being adopted by parents may make you think again. 

While some have already hit the UK, others are only just catching on – but all are set to influence how British parents behave in 2015.

While you might not actually need to 'eat for two' the new trend of dieting in pregnancy is highly dangerous 

One of the most worrying of the looming trends is the so-called 'Final Trimester Flat Belly Diet', spurred on by the increasing pressure new mothers feel to bounce back into their old size after giving birth.

Mothers-to-be are refusing the extra 300 calories a day recommended by health professionals and dieting instead so they can get back into a bikini within six weeks. 

With online guides to slashing your final trimester calorie intake to as low as 1,200 a day, women are existing on green tea and low fat, low carb diets at the one time they should be eating well to nourish their baby.

Women are also increasingly willing to work against their natural fertility or 'biological clocks', with more planning to have a baby over the age of 45 and an increase in 'sharenting'.

The experience of giving birth is now often immortalised on film and in social media snaps - meaning increasing numbers of women are concern with how they look and even what they are wearing in labour 

With one in five women now childless at 40, there's a growing trend for families to 'share' their kids with child-free friends. 

Encompassing the role of godparent, favourite aunt and babysitter, so-called 'sharenting' lets childless women enjoy the love and benefits of parenthood without the emotional upheaval or expense.

But for those women who want their own baby, having offspring later in life looks set to become increasingly common.

Poster girls include Oscar winning actress Halle Berry who had her second child at 47 and author Helen Fielding who gave birth to a son at 45 and a daughter at 48. And don't forget the dads – Paul McCartney had daughter Beatrice at 61, while Star Wars supremo George Lucas became a dad at 69. 

But not all the parenting trends set to hit UK shores are so serious in nature.

More and more women, like Halle Berry (left) and Helen Fielding (right) are having children later in life 

There is a rise in vanity in the delivery room, with expectant mothers planning fashionable birthing outfits (the most popular include bikini tops with frilled skirts on a string without the knickers), filming their labour and even undergoing full makeovers in the delivery suite.

Some of the UK's top hospitals are allowing new mothers to have Botox and blow-dries immediately after birth. 

The controversial – and highly expensive - packages are only available to those in the know.

Gender neutral parenting means no giving your child stereotypical toys 

Already popular with celebrities and high flyers who want to look picture perfect post-partum, the trend is set to spread to others as the pressure to appear stunning after labour grows. 

The ultimate selfie, labour videos inspired by hit TV shows One Born Every Minute chart the stages of labour from the first contractions until the placenta is delivered. To be shared on your child's 18th birthday and online with friends for maximum impact.

But the parenting fads don't stop at the maternity ward door. 

One craze becoming popular is that of  gender neutral parenting, where parents raise their children using only gender-neutral toys, clothes and terms in an effort to removed socialized gender steryotypes.

This can become as extreme as refusing to tell the child what sex they are, or families who treat a child as girls one day and boys the next until they discover what 'suits' them. 

A particularly creepy trend heading over from America is that of 'reborn dolls' of your own children

Costing up to £5,000 each, this expensive trend allows parents to buy dolls made in the exact image of their own child as a newborn. The dolls creators say it's most popular with mothers who are just seeing their youngest child leave the nest,, so they can keep the 'little one' of the family little forever.

On a similar thread is the fashion of printing out your child in 3D. As well as parents new love of uploading constant snaps to social media, the newest way to keep hold of happy family memories is to make models of your kids using a 3D printer. 

The mini-me models can be printed from any digital pic for around £60. With supermarkets now offering an in-store service, expect minifigs of your kids at every stage from newborn to 21st birthday to be one of the fastest growing trends next year.

Then, once you have perfectly preserved your gender neutral child in numerous forms, you can begin living ,vicariously through them.

Another trend is that of professional level sports for children.

Forget egg and spoon races at the local sports day, activities for children are increasingly professional and competitive 

Similar to the notorious Little League Baseball in America, leagues for child sports and mini marathons and triathalons for tots are growing. From the rise of competitive running clubs for under tens to buying £2,000 racing bikes for children, over active fathers are increasingly competing through their offspring.

From buying £2,000 racing bikes for children, over active dads could be fuelling a health and body image crisis in young kids.

The trends were collated by Stork TV, a new online chat show for mothers.

Founder Siobhan Freegard, also founder of Netmums said: 'Raising kids can bring out the best – and the worst – in mums. While some of these trends may seem extreme, what was extreme ten years ago is now mainstream. 

'The web means wacky ideas catch on fast and there is more pressure than ever before for parents to be perfect.' 

Mother Beck Laxton decided to bring up her son as gender neutral and spoke on ITV's This Morning to explain why she made this unusual choice and of her experiences in raising Sasha as neither boy or girl until he was five years old.

Explaining the concept of being gender nuetral, Beck says: 'It's just not making assumptions about what your kids are going to do or enjoy based on whether they're boys or girls

'I grew up with feminism so i grew up feeling equal rightswas still something we had to fight for

Beck Laxton made the decision to raise her son as gender neutral for his first five years 

'There are lots of things that girls like that I dont like to make it obvious to me that slotting me into a sterytype just because I'm female is silly.'

Beck's decision to raise her son without the influence of gender stereotypes was made before his birth, and began in the delievery room.

'When he was born we asked the nurses not to say wheter Sacha was a boy or a girl and actually it wasnt the first thing we looked for

'We just sat there holding the baby and didnt feel like we absolutely had to know urgently whether it was a boy or a girl. It didnt seem that important,' she explains.

Beck does admit that the reaction of others was oftne confused: 'The midwives did think we were strange. they kept trooping in and out saying ' we do need something to put on our foms, we have got to fill in our forms.'

Beck goes on to explain that even when they sent out an email to friends and family to announce the birth, they simply stated they had had a 'baby' and did not specify sex.

Despite his unusual start in life, Beck insists Sacha, now eight-years-old, knows he is male.

'He's always know he was a boy. We didn't do it for very long,' she explains.

'We tried to give him lots of different toys. There were lots of dolls around and lots of cars around. At the moment he is only interested in lego.

'The whole point was for him to find his own feet without people saying "oh boys cant do that."'
