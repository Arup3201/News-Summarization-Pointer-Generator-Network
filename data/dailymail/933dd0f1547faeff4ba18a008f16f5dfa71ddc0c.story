When great-grandmother Joan Lloyd swapped her bus pass for a boob job in November 2010, spending Â£4,250 to go from an A to an F cup, she not only changed her looks.

She changed her life when she landed herself a sexy new toy boy.

Joan, 66, has found love with Phil Absolom, who, at 28, is 38 years her junior, and she's moved him into the home she used to share with late hubby David, who died in 2010.

Joan, 66, has found love with Phil Absolom, who, at 28, is 38 years her junior

Last year she promised her dying husband that she would get a boob job and 'go further' in life after he passed away.

Speaking to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning she said: 'He mentioned it and starting to laugh about it and I said "Oh I can't do that" but he said "promise me."'

The mother of four's boobs started to sag after she had given birth so she took the plunge and had the operation.

Joan's late husband made her promise him that she would undergo the surgery

And it was after that that her and Phil's paths crossed, but they didn't meet in a conventional way.

Phil said: 'I met Jane through Facebook, it was a mistake, I was looking for a Weatherspoon chain because I was going away and then I saw Jane.

'I had done some research because of the papers she had been in and I thought I would say "Hello, how are you doing?" and wish her good luck and then Jane responded to me.

Despite their age difference, the couple seemed happy and relaxed in each others company on the show

'It took about three weeks, and I was going to give up in the end.'

'I had seen people being crude because obviously everyone sees Jane's busts before her personality, an then we started talking on the phone and it escalated from there.'

But Phil had stiff competition as Jane had received nearly 600 messages from men as young as eighteen interested in her.

Jane instantly fell for Phil's personality, she said: 'We have such good fun and when I first saw him, when he came to stay with me in the hotel before I came on the show, he came through the lobby and I thought "oh wow, that's just for me. You know I am going to have him, he is gorgeous"

The 66-yeard-old has received a mass of attention since she hit the headlines with her boob job

The pair love doing ordinary things like cooking together and playing monopoly

'My legs were like jelly when I saw him.'

Jane takes her fitness very seriously and Phil joked that many people find it difficult to keep up with her in life.

The couple laughed and joked on the show and explained how they enjoy cooking together and playing monopoly together.

Although Phil has received some negativity towards his relationship with Jane, he said: 'I think to myself, I could be with someone my own age but unhappy and it could fall apart.'

The pair don't have issues with the generational gap: 'We have to give and take' said Phil.

When asked what her late husband David would say if he was looking down on her, Jane replied: 'He would say "good on you girl, good on you. This is what I wanted you to do."'
