The mother of teen pop sensation Justin Bieber has opened up about the sexual abuse she endured as a child - and how it caused her life to spiral out of control.

Speaking to the Today Show, Pattie Mallette, 36, revealed she carried shame for years after the abuse, which began when she was just four, by a male babysitter and a friend's grandfather.

The horrific attacks later led to drug and alcohol addiction and a suicide attempt, she revealed.

'I was full of shame,' she said. 'I've learned it's normal for anybody who's been through sexual abuse to carry that shame and blame and feel like there's something wrong with you. I definitely 
carried that.'

Speaking out: The mother of Justin Bieber, Pattie Mallette, has revealed the years of sexual abuse she suffered from the age of four and how she struggled to deal with the shame

Family: Mallette gave birth to Justin when she was just 18 - but said abortion was never an option

Mallette reveals further details of her troubled childhood in her new book, Nowhere But Up.

By the time she was 14, she was taking drugs and alcohol to deal with the abuse, and by 15, she had lost her virginity. Two years later, she threw herself into the path of an oncoming truck to end her life.

'It was a culmination built up over the years of the abuse and the pain,' she said on Today. 'At the time I was messed up with drugs and alcohol and in a depression.'

As she was recovering in hospital, she was visited by a Christian counselor and had a spiritual awakening, she said - but after six months, she had slipped back into her bad lifestyle.

Innocence: She revealed the abuse started from the age of four - but did not say who was to blame

Troubled: She was taking drugs and alcohol by the age of 14 and tried to kill herself when she was 17

Aged 17, after reuniting with her on-again off-again boyfriend Jeremy Bieber, Mallette found out she was pregnant and, despite people telling her to abort the baby, she said it never crossed her mind.

'I just knew I couldn't,' she said. 'I just know I had to keep him. I didn't know how I was going to do 
it. But I just knew that I couldn't abort. I had to do my 
best, and I was determined to do whatever 
it took.'

When she was 18, Pattie gave birth to a healthy baby boy near her home in London, Ontario and, even though she had called him 'Jessie' all the way through her pregnancy, she named him Justin.

When Gifford asked Pattie about her newborn son's cries, she laughed: 'I know this 
sounds crazy, but it sounded like he was singing. He did!'

Baby, baby, baby: She said friends and family advised her to abort her son but she knew it was never an option

Doting: She brought up Justin with the help of her parents and worked a string of low-paying jobs

As soon as she heard him cry, 'I was like, "Oh my gosh, it is so precious and amazing. I just want to squeeze him",' she said.

Her relationship with Jeremy Bieber eventually broke down and, while her son maintained contact with his father, she largely raised him with the help of her parents, Bruce and Diane.

She worked a string of low-paying office jobs and lived in low-income housing. Justin's father went on to marry another woman and have two children

As Justin grew up, Pattie noticed her son had a rare singing talent and entered him in a local talent contest called 'Stratford Star' when he was 12.

Support: Justin has a good relationship with his father, Jeremy Bieber, who went on to have two more children

Starting young: Pattie uploaded videos of Justin to YouTube - which caught the eye of a manager

Star: Justin has three platinum albums and a legion of admiring fans - but remains close with his mother

'Healing': Mallette released her memoir last week

She began filming his performances and 
uploading them to YouTube so that his grandmother, who lived in a 
different part of Canada, could keep up-to-date with his progress.

But the clips also caught the eye of an Atlanta manager, Scooter Braun, who barraged Pattie with requests to work with her son - but she was hesitant.

'You just hear all these stories in the industry, the teenagers and how 
crazy they can go,' she said. 'I just had to come to terms with the fact
 that whether he’s in high school, at home or in the industry, there's 
those same fears.'

Justin Bieber, who has recorded three platinum-selling albums, garnered a legion of adoring fans and is worth a reported $108 million, told Gifford just how much respect he has for his mother.

'She’s been a friend - someone I can 
talk to you and a good role model,' Justin, 18, said. 'I want to grow up 
and have just the heart that my mom has, because she has such a big 
heart.'

Writing in the foreword to his mother's book, he added: 'My mom is the strongest woman I've ever met. I've always known it, but this book has helped to remind me just how strong she is.'

Of the book, Mallette added: 'I always wanted to write a book about my story. I wanted to be as vulnerable as I could, so that young girls who have been through similar things could relate.

'I pretty much bared my soul. It definitely furthered my healing process.'
