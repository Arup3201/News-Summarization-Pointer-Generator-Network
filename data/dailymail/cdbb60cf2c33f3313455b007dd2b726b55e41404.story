Persuading 100 sheep to stand still for a picture is no easy task.

But after six hours, and troughs full of food, photographer Carys Mair Evans captured this stunning image to help Young Farmers' Clubs in Wales raise funds for the British Heart Foundation.

She got two flocks of in-lamb ewes to form a heart shape at a farm in Llanfair, Powys.

Photographer Carys Mair Evans got two flocks of in-lamb ewes to form a 
heart shape and then took a picture of it to help Young Farmers' Clubs in Wales raise funds for the 
British Heart Foundation

Carys, 21, of Llanfair Caereinion, who runs her own photography business, is in the final year of a photography degree at Carmarthen University.

She said it was no easy task to get the final shot, with the end product requiring more than six hours of cajoling and two separate flocks of sheep.

The commission for the picture came from Gwenno Griffiths, the chair of Wales YFC, who is fundraising for the BHF as part of her 'Chairman's Challenge'.

Carys explained she was delighted to receive the commission and couldn't wait to get started.

She said: 'I was really happy about it and it had me written all over it. I was in Carmarthen at the time when they rang me and I got up and got dressed and went straight home and set about planning it with my family. The next morning I got up and we set about it straight away."

The picture was taken at her uncle's Robert Davies' farm, Adwy wynt in Llanfair, but only after first attempting to get the shot at her parents' farm, Plas Iolyn.

Rounding up the flock from the field and tempting them with food so that they follow the buggy to the 'studio'

Like herding cats: Carys started off 
arranging the sheep in the field but found she couldn't get the 
perspective (or get them to stay still!). 'In some cases it was good but just didn't have the 'wow 
factor' I wanted', she said

Facing the camera full on, the sheep wait as
Carys prepares the troughs in a heart shape on the farm in the hope the
new setting and the offer of food will help her get the picture she is looking for

She said: 'We started off 
putting feed down for the sheep in the shape of a heart. We started 
doing that on the fields at home but it proved to be a lot harder than I
first thought!

'I couldn't get the perspective, in some cases it was good but just didn't have the 'wow factor' I wanted.

'We
tried a few different locations there and the final shot was six hours 
later with the farm in the background. That worked best. We'd started at
7.30am and finished at 2.30pm.

'We tried different fields and different ways of putting feed down but in the end we did it by putting troughs down.'

She prepared a heart frame made out of troughs which she then filled with feed

Once the feed was poured in (left) the unsuspecting models filed into position

Gradually the heart formation came together (left) until finally, after six hours of trying, Carys got the all important shot she was looking for all day

How the final picture looked as part of her campaign to raise money for the British Heart Foundation

Carys had help from family and 
friends with her parents Gillian and Glyn, her friend Megan Hughes, aunt
and uncle Jo and Robert, and cousin Alfie, all getting involved.

She said she is delighted with the end product.

She
said: 'I am pleased with the reaction and overwhelmed with how much 
attention it has had on Facebook. People all over the world have been 
sharing it and liking the photo."

Carys said the picture has been made even more poignant after the sad death of her grandfather, Gron Davies, last week.

She said: 'It's especially special now because Adwy wynt is my grandfather's home
and sadly last week he passed away from a heart attack. That makes the 
picture special because it's for the British Heart Foundation and it's 
his home.'
