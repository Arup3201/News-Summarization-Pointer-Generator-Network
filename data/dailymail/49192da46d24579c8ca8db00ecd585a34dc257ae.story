A Red Bull Formula One car burst into flames during a demonstration run in Russia last weekend.

The 2011 car, which Sebastian Vettel claimed the second of his four world titles in, was on exhibition in Chelyabinsk ahead of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix later this season.

But the RB7, driven by 20-year-old Englishman and Red Bull junior driver Alex Lynn, spectacularly caught alight after he performed a series of doughnuts in the Russian city.

Champion racer: It was the car that Sebastian Vettel won the 2011 Formula 1 title in

 Fire starter: It begun after English driver Alex Lynn did a number of doughnuts on the street

Red Bull mechanics were promptly on hand to diffuse the situation, and Lynn, who heads feeder series GP3 after 10 rounds, emerged unscathed from the incident.

Red Bull’s blaze comes after Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes caught on fire during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix last month.

Mercedes said a fuel leak was to blame for the issue which saw Hamilton start the race from the pit lane. Hamilton fought through the field to finish third.

Daniil Kvyat, who drives for Red Bull junior team Toro Rosso, saw his race in Germany in July end prematurely after his Renault engine also caught on fire.
