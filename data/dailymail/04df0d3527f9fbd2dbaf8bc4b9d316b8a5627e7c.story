Lewis Hamilton came with his pet bulldog and went home with the top prize — BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

The Mercedes racing driver was a surprise winner of the coveted award in a glittering ceremony in Glasgow, capping a year that saw him secure the Formula One world championship for a second time.

He flew in from Los Angeles and flew pretty much straight back after adding his name to four previous winners from his sport — Sir Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, Nigel Mansell (twice) and Damon Hill (twice).

It was a shock because the bookmakers had installed Rory McIlroy as odds-on favourite. Hamilton had always seemed to be ‘Marmite’ — loved or hated — but the people who like him spread their love in the live phone-in to take him one place higher than he managed in 2007 and 2008. The margin — 209,920 to McIlroy’s 123,745 — was an even bigger surprise. 

The Ulsterman looked upset at coming second. Jo Pavey, who won two major athletics medals — including European gold in the 10,000m — at the age of 40 and having returned to the track in May after the birth of her second child, was third.

The claims of both Hamilton, who took his dog Roscoe for a walk on the red carpet before the ceremony, and McIlroy were immense.

McIlroy’s brilliance was showcased in 25 days, starting with his first round at Hoylake, where he won The Open, and finishing with his final round at Valhalla, where he won the USPGA Championship. His first World Golf Championship win fell in the middle. His aggregate total was 48 under par and 11 of the 12 rounds were under 70. Remarkable statistics by any stretch and then there was the sheer uninhibited style of his play. Those claims were impressive.

But so were Hamilton’s. He was only the fourth Briton to win double world championships — joining Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Stewart. He has won more races than any compatriot (33). His 11 race wins this season was another national record.

Oh, yes, the car was good but his ability to put it in places others could not at speeds they could not match was remarkable. It has been that way ever since he announced himself as a talent of rare brilliance. And he does it in a dangerous sport.

One wonders how much nationality had to play in the outcome. McIlroy has said he will compete for Ireland at the Olympics. Hamilton, despite where his taxes are paid, is avowedly British.

‘I am so proud of being British,’ he said. ‘I am proud and honoured to be among such talent. A huge thank you to all the people who called in. It’s been such an incredible year. I couldn’t have done it without my team and my family. 

'My father did four jobs to make this possible. Being here is a reminder of how many great sportsmen we have, and I never thought I would be up here with the greats. This is a dream.’

Yet another award fell at Cristiano Ronaldo’s twinkling feet when he was named Overseas Personality of the Year.

On an evening populated by the royalty of Scottish sport — mostly handing out the prizes, though in the case of Sir Chris Hoy awarded one himself — as well as Prince Harry, Ronaldo added some foreign glitz. His Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale presented the award to his fellow and greatest Galactico, who this year scored his 200th goal in 178 games. His 23 hat-tricks is a La Liga record.

Paul McGinley, meticulous captain of Europe’s Ryder Cup- winning golfers in Gleneagles, was awarded Coach of the Year. A misnomer perhaps, but who could begrudge him after his team was so good it almost rendered an intrinsically heart-stopping competition an anti-climax?

In every sphere Europe had the measure of the USA, as they posted a 16½-11½ victory.

Sunday night’s ceremony was staged in Glasgow’s Hydro, a venue for this summer’s superb Commonwealth Games. So it was appropriate that Hoy, a twice Commonwealth champion, was handed the Lifetime Achievement Award. Hoy, 38, is Britain’s most decorated Olympian with six gold medals and one silver on his bulging c.v. He also has 11 world titles. But the facts do not convey what a fabulous standard-bearer for British sport he has been.

All 12,000 of the cheering home crowd realised something of his status as a true sportsman in the rounded sense of the word.

It has been a phenomenally successful season for Lewis Hamilton, who can now proclaim himself to be a double Formula One world champion and winner of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.

Here is a rundown of Hamilton's season in numbers.

209,920 - Number of public votes received in the 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.

67 - Points ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg at the end of the season.

11 - Wins this year, making him the most successful non-German driver in one season as Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel both won 13 races in a single campaign.

7 - Fastest laps this season.

7 - Pole positions this year, although he came second to Rosberg who scored 11.

5 - His highest run of successive wins this year. Only Schumacher, Vettel and Alberto Ascari have managed more in one season.

2 - A second world title means Hamilton is now one of 16 drivers to have been champion more than once.

1 - After two second-placed finishes, Hamilton has his first BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.
