An Australian driver has been filmed allowing a toddler to steer a car through suburban streets while sitting on his lap.

A video - believed to have been shot in Melbourne - was then posted online and shared on YouTube.

It has since been removed.

The footage shows the child  - who does not appear to be wearing a seatbelt - sitting on the lap of a male driver and holding the steering wheel.

An Australian driver has been filmed allowing a toddler to steer a car through suburban streets while sitting on his lap

On a number of occasions the driver can be seen then removing one hand from the wheel - letting the child steer.

The driver's right hand remains touching the wheel lightly as the child takes control.

Acting inspector Tim O'Conner, the Brimbank local area commander, told 3AW the stunt was one of 'absolute stupidity', 9news reports.

He said: 'It didn’t appear the child was wearing a seatbelt, you’ve got the possibility of an airbag going off - and we know how dangerous they can be to the people sitting in the seats - and also just the fact that it is a danger to other road users.'

If found the man could be charged with 'conduct endangering' and a number of traffic offences, he added.

'It is really a matter of sitting down and going through it (the video) again and make sure we cover everything off,' Mr O’Conner said.
