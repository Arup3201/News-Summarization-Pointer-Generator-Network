Fifty British troops have been killed in Afghanistan without  taking out life insurance.

They could not afford premiums of up to £74 a month to cover their loved ones in the event of their death or serious injury.

Jim Murphy, Labour’s defence spokesman, said the figures, which he obtained through parliamentary questions, were very worrying.

Risking life and limb: British troops in action in Afghanistan are failing to buy life insurance which costs up to £74 per month

He suggested that young soldiers earning a basic private’s salary of just over £17,000 a year would be reluctant to spend the equivalent of 5 per cent of their annual income on an insurance policy.

Mr Murphy also discovered that as many as 35,600 troops have served in Afghanistan – braving Taliban bombs, mortars and ambushes – without life insurance. Another 26,400 took out less than the maximum cover.

‘It is a real concern that there are so many service personnel without life insurance,’ he said.

‘The Government must do more to ensure it is affordable and available for those making huge sacrifices and taking enormous risks.

‘Forces families understand the importance of this issue and will expect their loved ones to receive the highest levels of information, support and care.’

Most of Britain’s armed forces take out Pax life insurance, a specially tailored voluntary scheme run for the Ministry of Defence by finance giant Aon. The scheme was set up in 1989 to provide cover for military personnel.

Many high street insurance companies are reluctant to sell life insurance to servicemen and women, especially if they are about to deploy to a warzone.

Since April 2007, 55,900 troops have served in Afghanistan covered by Pax. Under the scheme, soldiers can buy one unit of cover for £4.94 a month, or the maximum of 15 units for £74.10.

A basic policy pays out from £10,000 if a soldier is killed and £20,000 for loss of limbs or vision.

If a finger or toe is lost in battle, the scheme offers compensation starting from £7,000. Sources at the MoD said soldiers got an operational allowance of £5,400 for a six-month tour of duty in a warzone. ‘You could suggest that £74 a month is a wise investment for a private soldier to make,’ said one.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘This is just opportunism from Labour. It is rich for Jim Murphy to criticise the Pax scheme when it’s the same one that existed when Labour were in power.

‘All service personnel injured as a result of services will benefit from the increased amounts of money provided through the armed forces compensation scheme which is completely taxpayer-funded.

‘Insurance is voluntary. Pax is just one of a number of insurance schemes available which are well publicised to all service personnel.’

Defence minister Andrew Robathan said: ‘Information on the personal insurance cover available is specifically provided to personnel during initial training and on pre-deployment briefings, including information on schemes specifically designed with the needs of service personnel in mind.’

The Government provides lump sum compensation payments of up to £570,000 for wounded troops.

A total of 397 British troops have died since the military mission started in Afghanistan in 2001.
