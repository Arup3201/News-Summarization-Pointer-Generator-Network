It's considered a time honored Thanksgiving tradition to devour the delicious turkey dinner.

But one woman has created the ultimate Thanksgiving meal...using nothing but Rice Krispies.

Jessica Siskin, a New York-based food artist, decided to create the incredible life-like plate of food with all of the trimmings, including mash potatoes and gravy, turkey, corn and stuffing.

Her one-of-a kind meal is featured on the social media site, Instagram, under the handle Mister Krisp where she sells her incredible art.

Her page features dozens of images of  everyday items such as chicken wings and even a bowl of hummus to go with the big meal, all transformed with Rice Krispies.

She has even managed to cleverly re-create something to talk about after dinner with the cheeky image of Kim Kardashian's now famous  booty picture featured in Paper Magazine.

Siskin said she originally came up with the innovative idea for the treats when she needed to make a dessert for a friend's potluck last fall, and settled on a Rice Krispie Treat.

'I don't know how to cook anything besides Rice Krispie Treats' she tells MailOnline. 

Each treat that she makes, typically takes between 40 minutes and two hours to make. 

And she is clear about why she enjoys using   the breakfast cereal in her food art.

'Because everything tastes better when it's made of rice krispie treat...except pizza,' she writes.

Support: Siskin used to work for the Olsen twins, seen here, and said 'They've been so supportive'

The talented artist previously worked at Elizabeth and James, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's fashion line. 

'They've been so supportive,' she says of the Olsen twins, adding that Elzabeth and James sent Mister Krisp snowmen to the brand's top customers for the holidays. 

Now, as families across the country prepare for their annual Thanksgiving dinner, Siskin's Rice Krispie version is  enough to set off a whole host of cravings ahead of November 27.

It's fortunate that this non-traditional meal is, in fact totally edible.
