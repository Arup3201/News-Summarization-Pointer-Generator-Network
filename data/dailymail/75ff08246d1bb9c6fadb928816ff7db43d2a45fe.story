Guilty: Steven Berkoff, 75, at City of London Magistrates, where he was found guilty of driving without due care and attention and fined £400

Actor Steven Berkoff berated a woman as she lay injured in the road after he had knocked her down, a court heard yesterday.

The
76-year-old, who was the Bond villain in Octopussy, showed ‘no concern’
for Fiona Scully and leapt from his VW Beetle to say ‘I didn’t touch 
you’.

He had knocked her 
down when he pulled out to pass another car that had stopped to let her 
cross Oxford Street in central London.

Miss
Scully, who needed hospital treatment and had to use a walking stick 
for ten days, told City of London magistrates: ‘I was quite shocked at 
the time and am still quite shocked that he didn’t say “Are you OK?”

‘There was no apparent concern or offer of assistance. What struck me was a very aggressive man in a rush.’

Miss
Scully was with a friend last New Year’s Eve when the driver of a Mini 
halted to let her cross the road – and was passed by Berkoff in his 
Beetle.

She said: ‘It 
hit me and knocked me to the ground.

'At that stage the car would have 
been on the other side of the road, I was lying on the road.

‘It
had hit me on my right leg. The driver got out of the car and his words
were something to the effect of “Oh, I didn’t hit you, I didn’t touch 
you”.’

Passing shoppers rushed to help and Miss Scully was taken to hospital with severe bruising and swelling.

When the actor was stopped by the police, he could only 
produce a Californian driving licence, which was no longer valid in this
country.

Representing
himself in court, Berkoff blamed Miss Scully for the accident and 
insisted only his ‘speed and reflexes’ saved her from worse injury.

He
told the court: ‘I was totally shocked and somewhat agitated because I 
couldn’t believe someone would walk straight in front of the car.

'I 
didn’t lose my temper, but I was angry because of the situation.

‘Had they looked round they would have certainly seen me.’

Headded : 'I was shocked how they had suddenly rushed. I sounded my horn 
and slowly pulled out and so it would be impossible to hit anybody 
unless they had run out in front of the car. If they were to be hit it 
would mean I would have to speed around the corner.'

But magistrates did not find his evidence credible and Chair of the Bench Dr Andrew Pairmley said: 'We find you guilty of driving without due care and attention.

'We
find the witness' evidence credible. We felt in these circumstances 
your standard of driving fell below that of a reasonable and competent 
driver.'

Incident: The actor, 76, knocked down Fiona Scully with his Volkswagen Beetle on Oxford Street (pictured) last New Year's Eve

Berkoff was fined £350 for driving 
without due care and attention and £50 for driving otherwise than in 
accordance with a licence at City of London Magistrates.

He
was given three penalty points to be added to his UK driving licence 
when he applies for it to be restored.

It expired after he was banned 
for six months in February for jumping a red light.

Berkoff was also ordered to pay £250 towards prosecution costs and a £35 victim surcharge.

Fame: Berkoff, best known for his role as Russian baddie General Orlov in classic Bond film Octopussy (pictured), told his victim: 'I didn't touch you', the court heard

Berkoff
had his UK licence taken away in February this year when he received a 
driving ban for jumping a red light in central London. He now faces 
another ban.

In his acting career he has also appeared in Oscar-nominated film Beverly Hills Cop
and alongside Sylvester Stallone in the 1985 action flick 'Rambo: First
Blood Part II'. 

He is also a well-known writer and director.
