When Luis Suarez chased down Villarreal defender Mateo Mussachio, dispossessed him, and crossed for Barcelona to open the scoring in the Copa del Rey semi-final first-leg two weeks ago, the Nou Camp chanted his name.

It was a strange moment, especially as the goalscorer had been Lionel Messi. It seems Suarez has won over his new supporters almost without scoring goals.

He turns up in Manchester for his first game on English soil since his £75million transfer having scored just seven times in all competitions in 22 games, but there is no crisis because supporters have learned to love the new Suarez – the one who makes their all-star front-three tick.

Messi has 37 goals and Neymar has 24 and, as Sergio Busquets tells Sportsmail in an exclusive interview, the Barca dressing room feels that Suarez’s work off the ball has been a major part of that.

‘We don’t play the way Liverpool play; he is not receiving the final pass as often,’ Busquets says, justifying the scoring dip since last season. ‘But since he arrived he has given us a lot more power up front in games and he opens the space up for other players with his running off the ball.’

In his 22 games so far he has clocked-up 12 assists and given Barcelona a presence in attack that has allowed Messi in particular to find a little more time and space.

‘It helps that they get on well together off the pitch,’ said coach Luis Enrique recently and the mate-sharing sessions with Javier Mascherano have certainly helped his acceptance into the group.

If the lack of goals have been a surprise perhaps the sacrifice on the pitch should not be. For all his flaws Suarez could never be accused of not being a team player. When he turned up at Liverpool in January 2011 he didn’t ask to become the club’s designated penalty taker as his replacement Mario Balotelli did when he joined this summer. 

And when in January 2013 the club signed Daniel Sturridge the potential clash of egos never came to pass because Suarez happily played wider or deeper to accommodate Brendan Rodgers’ new centre-forward.

In his autobiography Crossing the Line published last year he admits to feeling selfish at Anfield only once – during the last game of the season against Newcastle when he felt his team-mates were running the clock down because the title dream had died while he wanted another goal to pip Cristiano Ronaldo to the Golden Shoe. 

‘When we were winning and players were gesturing for us just to keep the ball, I was saying the opposite. I wanted us to attack, to go forward. I got wound up. I was shouting, "No, no, attack!"' he admits.

In the end he stayed on 31 goals and shared the prize with the Portuguese. This season there will be no repeat of that feat. He has only four league goals and trails Ronaldo by 25 goals. But in his first season at his new club that will not matter.

What will matter is that he make an impact in his first appearance back on English soil since that home win over Newcastle on the last day of last season.

With the return coming at the Etihad he will be up against the player who he described as probably his toughest opponent – Vincent Kompany.

‘We’d benefited too from Vincent Kompany getting injured and Yaya Toure going off after picking up a knock’ he said of that famous win over Manchester City at Anfield that had Liverpool believing it really was going to be their year.

‘Kompany is probably the hardest defender I faced in the Premier League – he organises City, and is one of the best in the world in his position.'

‘We go again’ was the famous Steven Gerrard war-cry at the end of that Liverpool win over City. 

A slip from Kompany led to one of the goals. Now Barcelona must go again after the weekend defeat to Malaga.

It was the first time they had not won since the opening game of the year when coach Luis Enrique left Messi and Neymar on the bench for the first half. Since that 1-0 reverse the 11-game winning run produced 40 goals and 28 of them had come from the boots of the front three.

Only four of those came from Suarez but the spectacular scissor kick coming off the bench in the 5-0 win over Levante was perhaps the pick of the bunch.

At the weekend triumphant Malaga coach Javi Gracia mimicked Suarez's goal celebration in his press conference kissing three of his fingers for the three points his team had just picked up. ‘What a time to have a siesta?’ asked the Catalan press.

Tuesday night’s game represents a chance for them to get back in the winning routine immediately, and will give Suarez a chance to get back in the scoring habit. 

What he can be sure of however is that if he doesn’t find the back of the net but he does manage to find Neymar and Messi, and they do, then no one will be complaining.
