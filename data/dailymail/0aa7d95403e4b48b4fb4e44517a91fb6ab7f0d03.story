A drought-stricken lake in California has turned up a surprising discovery - the gun and badge of a federal agent which was accidentally dropped overboard more than two decades ago. 

The backpack was spotted by a fisherman at Castaic Lake in north Los Angeles County, California on Thursday. 

The water level has dropped almost 50 per cent to 151 feet, leading the gun and badge to be easily retrieved from once deep water.

The lingering drought in California has lowered the water level in Castaic Lake in northwestern LA county so dramatically that a fisherman found a gun, badge, watch and pager belonging to a federal agent 

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Johnny Jones told the Los Angeles Times: 'We knew it'd been there a while when we saw an old pager.' 

A watch and mini-calendar from 1992 were also found in the backpack. 

The deputies were able to find the agent who works for the LA County Probation Office. 

The agent revealed that he had been on the lake one day in 1992 and dropped his bag over the side of a boat, adding that he had gotten into trouble for the mistake. 

California is suffering its worst drought since 1895, when records began. Combined with unusually warm temperatures and stagnant air conditions, the lack of precipitation has triggered a dangerous increase in wildfires and incidents of air pollution across the state.

A recent report estimated that the water shortage would result in direct and indirect agricultural losses of at least $2.2 billion and lead to the loss of more than 17,000 seasonal and part-time jobs in 2014 alone.

Such impacts prompted California Governor Jerry Brown to declare a drought emergency and the federal government to designate all 58 California counties as natural disaster areas.

Researchers last month found that California's unprecedented drought is 'very likely' linked to human-caused climate change.

They say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the Pacific Ocean that diverted storms away from California was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations.

It is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and California's ongoing drought. 

Scientists also determined that as long as high levels of greenhouse gases remain, severe droughts could become more frequent.

'California is more likely to see these episodes in the near term,' said environmental scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, who led the study.

Despite the findings, Thomas Peterson, principal scientist at NOAA's National Climactic Data Center and one of the report's editors, said it is still hard to definitively link rainfall to climate change.
