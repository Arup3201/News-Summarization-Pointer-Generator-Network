A 13-year-old boy was forced to watch his mother's body wash ashore and his father apparently drown in a tragic snorkelling accent off the coast of Australia.

The family was on a 'dream holiday' which they were planning to turn into a book, it emerged today as the search for the missing father continues around the idyllic Coral Bay in Western Australia.

The victims were 41-year-old Kathreen Ricketson and her husband Rob Shugg, 48, who were travelling around the country with their son and 10-year-old daughter.

Police said today they held grave fears for Mr Shugg, who has not been found despite an intense day-long search off Elle's Beach, south of the bay and the nearby Ningaloo Reef.

Inspector Dominic Wood said the couple's son, who had been left on the beach with his sister, raised the alarm after he realised his parents were in trouble when he went into the water to swim with them and saw them face down.

It has not been revealed whether they were still wearing snorkelling apparatus.

As Ms Ricketson's body washed ashore, another family who had been travelling with them activated an emergency beacon which resulted in police racing to the area.

But nothing could be done to help Ms Ricketson.

'It must have been horrific,' said Inspector Wood. 'It must be any child's worst nightmare.'

Just what happened out on the reef to result in a woman dying and her partner going missing was being investigated by police today.

But Mr Wood said there were no evident injuries on the woman's body, apparently ruling out a shark attack.

Ms Ricketson, from Canberra, wrote on a website as the family set out for their travels around the country that they had a publishing deal for a book called Family Road Trip.

'The book is not just any old travel book,' she wrote. 'It will be part on-the-road memoir, part family camping adventure how-to, but mostly it will be a whole bunch of fun projects that can be done in a day or a weekend by those who want to get away from it all and reconnect with their families.'

She continued: 'Our trip will take us, with our camping trailer, around Australia for a year.

'The kids will be home-schooled and Rob and I will be working on the road. We have power, internet and our laptops and so theoretically we will be able to work from almost anywhere.'

On a later blog she described the trip to the Ningaloo Reef as 'a dream come true.'

Her latest note stated that she and the family were bush camping at a cattle station near the coast and the reef.

Inspector Wood said the couple entered the water at about 2.45pm on Wednesday and the woman's body washed ashore some 45 minutes later.

A search of the reef and inlets near Coral Bay by expert police divers from Perth has failed to find Mr Shugg and Barney Hutchison, from West Australia Water Police, said hopes were dimming as time passed.

'The missing man has been in the water a long time and hopes of finding him fade with each passing hour,' he told ABC radio.

Police said that even though the 13-year-old boy described seeing both parents face down in the water, Mr Shugg had since disappeared.

Mr Wood said that people on the beach thought the pair was snorkelling when they saw them face down in the water.

But when they did not respond to calls from the children, Ms Ricketson was pulled ashore and campers tried desperately to save her life.

'While they were trying to save the life of the mother, they noticed the father was also not moving in the water,' he said. 'As they tried to get him out he disappeared under the water.

'The kids were obviously there and it would have been an absolutely devastating situation for them.'

Police said they were regarding the incident as a 'tragic accident'.

The couple's children were flown to Perth today where they were met by family members who had flown in from Tasmania.
