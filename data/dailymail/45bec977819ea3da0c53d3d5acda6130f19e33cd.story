A 26-year-old guy who grew a hipster beard while travelling overseas has revealed how his bushranger facial hair landed him an international modelling contract and over 50,000 Instagram followers.

Less than two years after he left his job as a barman and a painter in Sydney’s northern beaches, Chris Perceval from Manly is now getting paid to pose in designer clothes.

The heavily-tattooed 6ft 2inch model, who has been turned away from bars and jobs in Sydney because of his distinctive look, told Daily Mail Australia he started growing the beard while living in Croatia for two months in 2013 after a friend told him he’d make a good model.

‘I was then working in a bar in Shoreditch [London] when another model started speaking to me and said “you’ve got this look, you might as well capitalise on it”,’ Chris said.

While he lived in Sydney he was once turned down for a job because of the tattoos on his knuckles 

Before arriving in London Chris had been training to be a cage fighter and he decided to ‘knuckle down’ and get back into shape before he visited a modelling agency. When he did walk through their doors he was ‘signed within a day’.

Chris’s biggest fan, his proud father Peter, argued that despite all the new found attention his son has always been a looker.

‘When you see photos without the beard you will see how good looking he is,’ Peter said.

‘I am so proud he’s been able to achieve all this in this very short period of time…. He’s purposefully put this stuff together to achieve what he’s achieved so I can’t knock it,’ he explained.

‘I think it’s a little bit strange, as do a lot of people who know him quite well, but that’s how he’s done it. I’m so proud of him and how his work ethic has changed and he’s really working hard to be successful.’

Asked where Chris gets his looks from, Peter joked: ‘His mother is very tall and I’m extremely good looking.’

Chris added: ‘He doesn’t like the beard, some people do, some people don’t.'

‘It’s just a trend. I’m happy to have been at the start of the trend it is a bit saturated now,’ he confessed.

Chris is considering shaving off his trademark beard once the look is no longer fashionable in Sydney. He will then go back to London to do more work there.

‘I came back to Sydney because I thought it doesn’t really have anyone that looks like me in the market but since I’ve been out here it’s become really popular.’ 

Chris said although his first few modelling shoots overseas were ‘intense’ he’s ‘always been pretty good at posing’.

And he’s been promised that if he shaves off the beard he won’t be dropped by his agencies. ‘My agents are happy for me to cut it off… It would be awkward if they told me not to cut it,’ he laughed.

Chris got a '21' tattoo on his face because he was born on the 21st of the month

Chris, seen modelling on the front page of a magazine, has been promised that if he shaves off the beard he won’t be dropped by his agencies 

Chris shares selfies with his thousands of fans every day and goes to the gym once or twice a day

He one day hopes to model for Calvin Klein and also has aspirations to be an actor 

Despite the work and freebies his beard has bought him, there are some downsides to sporting the statement look.

‘You wake up with it everywhere across your face. It can get too floppy or you can’t get the moustache right sometimes. It’s itchy and you’re like “get it off”,’ Chris said.

‘I style it and brush it every day… I guess I’m attached to it now,’ he laughed.

Chris plans to return to London in February and hopes to break into acting as well as one day modelling for brands such as Calvin Klein, Fendi and Diesel.

But when it comes to women he’s ‘too busy for that sort of stuff’.

‘A lot of people are shallow and superficial when they found out what your job is… for me it’s just about a good personality not how attractive they are.’
