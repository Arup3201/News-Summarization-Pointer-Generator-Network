Retaliation: Adam Hock, pictured yesterday, charged with beating up Monaco's Prince Pierre Casiraghi, has said he was defending the 'honour of the women he was with'

A former club owner charged with beating up Monaco's Prince Pierre Casiraghi, has said he was defending the 'honour of the women he was with' - a bevy of supermodels.

Adam Hock, has been accused of leaving the 24-year-old prince with a broken jaw and needing hospital treatment after he punched him at Double Seven, a Meatpacking 
District bar.

But Mr Hock has denied he began the brawl and said the prince and his four friends began the trouble in the early hours of Saturday morning.

'I acted 100% in self-defence. I felt I 
had to defend the honor of the women I was with,' said Hock, 47 who 
was pictured leaving a clinic wearing a sling on his left arm, reported New York Daily News.

'I feel I was victimized by several 
drunk, entitled guys, who felt they deserved the prime table with the 
most beautiful girls,' Hock told the New York Post.

'They expected to be treated like the royalty they are. They didn’t get what they wanted, and it pissed them off.'

But the prince's camp insists the one-time 
football jock went berserk, swinging round-house punches at anyone in 
sight in the early Saturday brawl.

'The facts are very clear,' said Nadine Johnson, a spokeswoman for Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, reported New York Daily News.

'There was only one person arrested, Mr. Hock, who spent two days in jail as a result of his actions.

Mr Hock said he is deciding whether he will press charges against the four.

Mr Hock was 
sitting with two friends and three catwalk models when the prince, the third
in line to Monaco’s throne, allegedly approached him and started a 
confrontation after trying to drink a $500 bottle of vodka from their table.

'I thought they were being childish, 
because they then sent over another bottle of vodka, saying, "If you 
don’t want us to drink your vodka, here’s another bottle," ' Hock said 
to the New York Post.

Court: Prince Pierre Casiraghi, pictured, and his friends were accused by lawyers of being jealous because Adam Hock was with a group of beautiful women, referring to them as 'trust-fund babies' and 'spoiled brats'

Friends: Stavros Niarchos III, heir to a Greek shipping fortune was with his girlfriend, model, Jessica Hart, when the fight broke out and he tried to help the prince

After a confrontation Hock is said to have punched the prince 
and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he
landed with blood pouring from his face.

‘Pierre’s face looked broken, 
with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like 
he needed plastic surgery.’

But Hock‘s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, insisted that Casiraghi started the fight and threw the first punch.

He accused the prince and his friends of being 'wealthy barons from Europe' with an inflated sense of ownership.

'They think New York is their honeycomb. They think they can come here and do whatever they want,' Strazzullo said to the New York Daily News.

The 47-year-old was arrested and 
later appeared in court, charged with four counts of assault against 
Prince Pierre and three of his friends.

Hock’s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said: 
‘My client was with some very very nice women and Mr Casiraghi became 
jealous of who he was with.

They wanted some recognition [from the 
women] and it happened because of that. My client acted in self- 
defence, it was an unprovoked attack.

‘I don’t know why Mr Casiraghi got  
jealous about my client – he is from a humble background.’ He added: ‘My
client is not Bruce Lee… These four guys are trust-fund babies who 
think the world is owed to them. They are like spoiled brats.’

But one of the prince’s friends said he was ‘slammed for no reason’, and that another was punched when he tried to intervene.

Richard Golub, who is representing the prince and his friends, said the incident was ‘entirely unprovoked’.

Pierre’s family have a long history 
of  scandal and intrigue, and the latest episode seems to suggest he is 
following in their footsteps.

Known as the ‘party prince’, Pierre 
is believed to have dropped out of university and has been seen at 
nightclubs everywhere from Miami to Milan.

The fight broke out on Saturday, at 
the Double Seven club in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District. Prince Pierre
and his entourage, who were drinking £350 bottles of champagne, are 
said to have gone over to Hock’s table and started behaving 
‘obnoxiously’.

Among those with the prince was 
Jessica Hart, a supermodel, Stavros Niarchos III, a shipping heir and 
ex-boyfriend of Paris Hilton, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, a New York art 
dealer and godson to photographer Mario Testino, and Diego Marroquin, a 
Manhattan socialite

Among those on Hock’s table were 
catwalk models Natasha Poly,  Valentina Zalyaeva and Anja Rubik, and the
club’s owner, Jeffrey Jah.

Hock is said to have punched Prince Pierre 
in the face and lashed out at three of his friends, one of whom 
allegedly grabbed a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and tried to hit Hock 
with it.

The prince was taken to hospital for treatment and released a short time later.

The episode once again puts  the 
spotlight on Monaco’s royals – or the Grimaldi family, as they are  
better known.

They are said to have been cursed by a 13th century 
witch, who vowed no member of the dynasty would ever have a long or 
successful marriage.

Prince Pierre’s grandmother, actress 
Grace Kelly, brought Hollywood glamour to the family when she married 
Prince Rainer III in 1956. She died in a car crash in 1982.

Pierre’s father, Stefano, was Princess Caroline’s second husband, and died in a boating accident when Pierre was three.

Her marriage to her third husband, 
German prince Ernst August  von Hanover, has struggled amid episodes of 
public drunkenness and  alleged infidelity.

Prince Pierre’s elder brother Andrea,
27, is studying at the University of Barcelona, while his sister 
Charlotte, 25, is a magazine editor and amateur show jumper.
