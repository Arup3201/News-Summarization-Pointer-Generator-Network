Natarsha Belling said a tearful goodbye to viewers today as Channel 10's breakfast show, Wake Up, aired for the last time.

James Mathison delivered an odd farewell to viewers, as he comforted his tearful co-host with the line: 'Let's hug it out, b*tch.'

Channel 10 CEO Hamish McLennan announced on Wednesday that the breakfast show, which has struggled to attract viewers since it began six months ago, would be cancelled and would film its final episode today.

'You cried first!' Mathison teased Belling for breaking down as she said the words 'last ever show'

Belling was emotional throughout the broadcast, breaking down as she spoke the words 'last ever episode.'

Her co-host, James Mathison, comforted her and gave her a hug. He took over from Belling who was unable to speak and introduced a story about the show's best moments.

Belling regained her composure but teared up again toward the end of the show as she paid tribute to her co-host.

'Jimmy, I absolutely adore you,' she said. 'It has been my absolute pleasure sharing this... journey with you.'

After they finished taping, a visibly upset Natarsha joined Mathison and the show's crew for champagne on the deck of Manly’s Queenscliff Surf Club, where the show is filmed.

'It seemed like only six months ago that we started this journey,' he joked.

Mathison was in good spirits, making a good-humoured allusion to his tweet on Wednesday that he need a 'scotchy, scotch, scotch' after hearing about the show's fate.

When Natarsha Belling told viewers it was 'a glass half full kind of morning here at the beach house,' he joked: 'Glass half full of whisky.'

Mathison said he was 'fiercely proud' of Wake Up and said that he and Belling 'look after each other, and that's been the ethos of this show.'

Belling also thanked her mother who has 'held my hand the past two weeks'.

Belling posted another tweet after the emotional show, writing: 'Really tough day for a lot of hard working wonderful people at TEN. Thinking of you all today x'

Mathison dealt with his sadness in a different way.

This morning he shared that he would be filming the final episode of his show after just three hours of sleep.

'Here's a tip, if you're getting up at 330am for your last show ever, maybe don't watch three hours of Survivor: Cagayan until1230am,' he tweeted.

His Survivor-marathon explains the tone of a tweet last night, in which he  encouraged followers to tune into Wake Up.

'Don't forget, tomorrow morning is the exciting season finale of Wake Up. Tune in from 630am and see who gets eliminated! (SPOILER: We do),' he quipped.

Both co-hosts, as well as the show's news correspondent Nuala Hafner, posted a statement to Facebook thanking fans for tuning in each day.

'To all of our wonderful viewers, We want to take this opportunity to thank you for choosing to wake up with us every morning. We are humbled by the amazing support you've given us.

'Our aim was simply to put a smile on your face each morning – we hope we did that. If we ever managed to make you go on with your day feeling a little bit happier, then we did our job,' they wrote.

Channel Ten's new morning line-up, which replaces the early 5.30am news as well as Wake Up will start on Monday.

It will feature cooking show Ready, Steady, Cook at 6am, followed by repeats of Entertainment Tonight and The Bold and The Beautiful.

Rounding out the morning is Jamie's 30 Minute meals, which starts at eight.

According to a Ten announcement, Jamie's 30 Minute Meals is a first run episode.

Hermione Kitson, presenter of the early Eyewitness New bulletin, also filmed her last show today. Channel 10 announced on Wednesday that as well as Wake Up, the network's early, morning and late news bulletins would be cut.

Kitson was given a gift of farewell flowers on-air by Studio 10 co-host Sarah Harris. It is unclear whether Kitson, Belling or Mathison, will remain at Channel 10, with a voluntary redundancy program set to be rolled out from this week.

Wake Up was launched in November 2013, in a bid to compete with Channel Seven's Sunrise and Channel Nine's Today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop.

Wake Up was the brainchild of Sunrise mastermind Adam Boland, and was launched in November 2013, with three hosts, Natasha Exelby, James Mathison, and Natarsha Belling. Just 16-days later, Ms Exelby was cut from the panel, after it was decided the show's chemistry was not working.

It has struggled to attract viewers, averaging 30-40,000 per day, around a tenth of the viewers tuning in to Channels Nine and Seven.

In his email to staff informing them of the cuts yesterday, Channel Ten CEO, Hamish McLennan stated: 'Wake Up has not resonated with enough viewers to make it a viable program.'

The extent of the redundancies are not yet known, but in his email Mr McLennan informed staff that the struggling network will also cut its 5.30am, 11am, and 10.30pm news bulletins, though it will continue to produce the 5pm news bulletin.

'It is a tough period for Ten and we need to take some painful, but necessary, measures to restructure the business,' the email to staff said.

'Unfortunately, it is proposed that Wake Up and the Early, Morning and Late News will cease production on Friday, May 23, 2014. Studio 10 is performing well and will continue as a vital part of our daytime schedule, which ranks number one.'

He concluded the email saying: 'The next few weeks will be a difficult and sad period, as colleagues leave the business.'
