The opening ceremony of the Olympic Games will feature a performance by hundreds of nurses, it was revealed yesterday.

Artistic director Danny Boyle – the Oscar-winning director behind Slumdog Millionaire – said he wanted to celebrate everything that was ‘unique and special’ to the British Isles…including the National Health Service.

Europe’s biggest bell will be specially made to ring in the start of London 2012.

The 27-ton bell will be a feat of engineering and twice the weight of Big Ben.

Mr Boyle said the ceremony will be called ‘Isles of Wonders’ after a speech in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest.

More than anything, he said, he wanted it to be a ‘people’s Games’ and 
to try to capture the very particular, and sometimes peculiar, British 
sense of humour.

A sense of humour that has, at times, been tested by the spiralling 
budget for the Olympic ceremonies – last month it doubled to £81million.

At the vast rehearsal studios in East London Mr Boyle gave a small 
glimpse of what 80,000 spectators and millions of TV viewers can expect 
on July 27.

The biggest ringing bell in Europe has been commissioned and will hang at one end of the stadium.
It will ‘ring in’ the start of the Games and will be inscribed with 
Caliban’s line from The Tempest ‘Be not afeard; the isle is full of 
noises’.

The half-man, half-monster Caliban is devoted to the island on which he 
lives – and Mr Boyle hopes to mirror that pride and patriotism in the 
ceremony.

Indeed he seemed to be rather keen on monsters – he said that last 
year’s production of Frankenstein at the National Theatre had allowed 
him to practise lots of ideas.

So perhaps we’ll see lots of prosthetics,
green paint and pantomime costumes alongside runners from Kenya and 
gymnasts from Russia.

Another theme will be the cleansing and recovery of poisoned land – 
after the Olympic park site was cleaned of all its industrial 
pollutants.

One certainty is that there’ll be lots of flying – and flowers. A flying
system that can lift 25 tons, the equivalent of five elephants, has 
been installed in the main stadium to enable some impressive aerial 
acrobatics.

Most employers have not drawn up plans for dealing with an expected surge in staff absence during the Olympics, months before the Games start, according to a report today.

A survey of 1,000 office workers by recruitment consultants Badenoch & Clark showed that two-thirds were employed in companies yet to draft a plan.

Among those who have agreed procedures in place, some said annual leave will be given on a first-come, first-served basis, while a small percentage have told staff they will not be allowed to take a break while the Games are held.

Employers in London are among those most likely not to have told their staff about holiday plans when the sporting event is held in the capital.

Nicola Linkleter, managing director at Badenoch & Clark, said: 'Given the immense interest the London Olympic Games will create among workers, this is poor planning that could lead to employee discontent, confusion or threadbare cover.'

And Sebastian Coe, chairman of London 2012, dropped another hint by 
saying whenever he popped down to see rehearsals he kept tripping over 
buckets of flowers.

So it will be noisy, acrobatic, colourful and floral. What else?

Well, the only other confirmed part was that nurses will have a starring
role in one ‘sequence’ as the NHS is one of the things that is ‘unique 
about us…along with our sense of humour’.

Featuring with them will be some 900 children from the six Olympic host boroughs who have been auditioning in recent weeks.

No details of performers were revealed – but again a hint that 
‘everyone’ wants to take part. But we can expect the spectacular. And 
the unexpected.

Asked if the fear of technology going wrong had ensured they play safe, 
executive producer Stephen Daldry implied they would be pushing 
boundaries. He said: ‘The idea of jeopardy is one of the great fantastic
tensions of the evening.’

Mr Boyle said only about a third of the budget would be spent on the 
opening ceremony, which was much less than the £65million the Chinese 
spent at Beijing 2008.

He said: ‘You are standing on the shoulders of giants when you do this 
kind of job. You cannot but live in the shadow of your predecessors.

‘The spectacle of Beijing was just breathtaking. The sheer beauty of 
Athens is very inspiring but I have to say that Sydney has inspired us. 
It got the feel of a people’s Games right.

‘It is inevitable that people will compare us – and that is fine.

‘I think there is a sea change and we are lucky enough to be setting it.
It will be spectacular but the reduction in scale is inevitable.’

London 2012 said it will release more details of the opening in the 
run-up to the Games to give people a flavour of what to expect.

Mr Boyle said he would have preferred to keep everything a ‘surprise’ 
but that was impossible when everyone ‘films everything on their 
mobiles’.

Estimates suggest the advertising spend during the ceremony, which will last three hours, could be worth £2billion globally.

Staging
the four showpiece opening and closing ceremonies for the London 2012 
Games is 'challenging, daunting but also incredibly exciting', executive
producer Stephen Daldry said today.

He described it as like putting on 165 West End shows at the same time.

Nurses, the biggest ringing bell in 
Europe inscribed with lines from Shakespeare, and children will be key 
features of the opening ceremony.

Here are some of the facts, figures and details behind the ceremonies.
