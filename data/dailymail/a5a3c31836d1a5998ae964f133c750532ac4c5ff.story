A body discovered on a Phoenix mountain has been identified as that of a 23-year-old hiker visiting from Seattle.

The remains of Eric Fernandes were found Tuesday afternoon wedged between large rocks about 200 feet below the summit of Camelback Mountain.

The Washington man had been visiting the desert city with his father when he decided to scale the mountain before returning home.

They say the cause and manner of death are pending.

Fernandes was last seen Saturday atop the mountain by other hikers who said he was alone. They described him as surprised by the difficulty of the hike.

Crews had to stop searching for Fernandes on Monday because of 110-degree temperatures. The search resumed Tuesday morning.

The body was found Tuesday evening in the Echo Canyon area of Camelback Mountain.

The search for Fernandes began Sunday after his father reported him missing.

Sad clues: Fernandes' car was found parked at the bottom of the peak. Receipts for bottled water and hiking gear were found in the car

Max Fernandes made a public plea before his son's remains were found for hikers familiar with the popular recreation spot to come and aid in the search.

'We have lost precious time because of the heat,' Fernandes said. 'But every time when the temperature goes down in the evening, they don't have a second rescue team in succession to take advantage of the cooler temperatures. ... That's a shame.'

He told AZCentral.com that many volunteers readily offered their assistance.

It was two such hikers who discovered Fernandes wedged into a crevasse on Tuesday afternoon.

His remains were airlifted off the southwestern face of the mountain in a body bag around 7:45pm.

Phoenix Fire Department officials said the hikers reported finding the body about 200 feet from the peak in rugged terrain dotted with brush.
