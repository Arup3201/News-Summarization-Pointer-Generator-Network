He is known for his seriously masculine roles in action blockbusters such as the Fast and Furious franchise.

So it's perhaps no surprise that Jason Statham has been voted Britain's 'manliest man' in a national survey - a fact that will surely delight his girlfriend, Victoria's Secret Angel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

The 47-year-old actor gained a quarter of the votes, beating the likes of footballer David Beckham, 300 star Gerard Butler and even original tough guy, Ray Winstone.

Handsome couple: Jason's ultra cool and masculine demeanor has managed to get him one of the most desired women in the world - girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, right

Second place: Jason even managed to beat iconic 'tough guy' Ray Winstone in the national survey

Jason also was deemed 'more macho' than Tom Hardy, who is currently filming a biopic about notorious East End gangsters the Kray brothers, in which he plays Ronnie.

The 36-year-old actor, who also played Bane in Batman film The Dark Knight Rises, got 10 per cent of the votes, followed jointly by Beckham and Butler, who both got eight per cent.

At the other end of the scale, Prince William polled just one per cent of the votes, along with The X Factor's Simon Cowell. 

And it seems sporting success does not deem a man manly, as Olympians Tom Daley, Mo Farah and Amir Khan also all polled one per cent or less.

The celebrity list comes ahead of an opportunity to enter the men in your life into a 'manliest man' competition.

Men's
 Fitness magazine and men's cancer charity Orchid have teamed up with 
male grooming brand The Bluebeards Revenge to launch a campaign to find 
Britain's Manliest Man.

If you think a man in your life has got what it takes to win, you can enter your your husband, boyfriend or father - while self-confident men can even enter themselves.

The winner will be chosen by an expert panel and will secure a year's modeling contract to become the face of The Bluebeards Revenge, and be in with a chance to feature in Men's Fitness magazine.

It might seem frivolousness but the competition has a serious message behind it as it aims to raise awareness of testicular cancer.

More than 43,000 men are diagnosed every year in the UK with testicular, prostate and penile cancer.

The Manliest Man competition is encouraging men across Great Britain to 'Man Up and Check' for the early signs and symptoms of the disease.

Rebecca Porta, chief executive of Orchid, said: 'Every day 6 men in the UK aged 15-45 will be diagnosed with testicular cancer.

'Despite these statistics over 70 per cent of men still don’t know how to examine themselves.

'Even more alarmingly, a further 20 per cent have never even thought about self-examining.

'We want to change this with the help of the Manliest Man competition.'
