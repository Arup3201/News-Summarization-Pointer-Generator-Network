The Premier League could host a round of games abroad in the future.

Plans for an overseas set of matches are in an embryonic stage, but would appeal to the English top-flight’s huge global audience.

Any chance to boost revenue from abroad would be met with support from the clubs, while the crowd of 51,014 that attended Manchester United’s pre-season clash with Liverpool in Miami, after 109,318 saw United beat Real Madrid in Michigan, will encourage League chiefs.

A round of matches played abroad in late November or early December would be ideal for US audiences, while it would also bring the Premier League in line with the NFL staging games at Wembley.

Premier League games in the US could replicate NFL games being staged to great demand at Wembley 

The ill-fated ‘Game 39’ proposal — an extra match added to the League season to be played abroad — saw Premier League chief Richard Scudamore widely criticised six years ago. But at the start of this season, Scudamore reiterated his desire to showcase the top flight abroad.

He said: ‘The clubs wanted it then [in 2008] and they would all probably want it now. It will happen at some point. Whether it’s on my watch, who knows?’

Now, any foreign-based matches would seemingly be worked into the existing 38-game League format. 

Plans are also afoot to introduce a winter break midway through the season in an effort to help the England national side.

However, the FA would need to break with tradition by scrapping FA Cup replays and the two-legged League Cup semi-final to free up extra space in the calendar.

The lack of a winter break is often cited as a reason for England’s poor performances in tournaments, with every other major European league enjoying time off over Christmas.
