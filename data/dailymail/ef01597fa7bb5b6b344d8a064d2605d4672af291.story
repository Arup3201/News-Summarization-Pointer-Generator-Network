Reeva Steenkamp’s father has spoken of his pain at not being able to save his daughter the night she was shot dead by her boyfriend, Oscar Pistorius.

The South African athlete says he accidentally killed his model girlfriend after mistaking her for an intruder and opening fire through a door, but the prosecution say it was pre-mediated.

Barry Steenkamp, in an emotional interview, revealed that the incident was the third tragedy in her life.

He told Hello! Magazine: ‘She [Reeva] had three tragedies in her life – I was there for her the first and second time, but I wasn’t there for the third.

‘After she had her tonsils taken out when she was five, something went wrong and she almost bled to death. Then, when she was 19, she went riding on our farm. The horse stumbled, she came off and it fell on top of her, breaking her back. Luckily I was there, put her in the car and dashed to hospital.’

Reeva’s mother, June, in the same interview, revealed details about the dreadful moment she was told about the death of her daughter.

The news came at 7am on February 15, 2013, the day after she was shot from Detective Hilton Botha.

She said: ‘I became hysterical. Then I had to tell Barry. His reaction… it was too terrible. We both went into what can only be described as a walking coma.’

June added that when Reeva’s body was flown home she could only see her face, as the body was wrapped in sheets and a pale scarf.

She said: ‘She still looked beautiful. I kissed her and whispered “I love you, darling, and I’m going to miss you”. Then I collapsed.’

Reeva's death has taken its toll on her father, Barry, who has suffered a stroke and been unable to attend the court hearings.

The interview came as the trial entered its 38th day in Pretoria’s High Court.

The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Monday challenged the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel on Monday said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner.

The defense maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house.

Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a "forensic report" but disputed Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.

On Sunday, an Australian broadcaster showed video footage of Pistorius participating in a re-enactment of how he says events unfolded on the night he killed Steenkamp. In the video, Pistorius is seen walking on his stumps with an arm outstretched and fist clenched, as though holding a gun. It also shows Pistorius carrying a woman. It is unclear where the re-enactment was filmed.

The broadcast by Channel Seven prompted criticism from a lawyer for Pistorius who said the re-enactment was made with the help of a U.S.-based company last year as part of the defense team's trial preparations. The video has not been shown at the trial.
