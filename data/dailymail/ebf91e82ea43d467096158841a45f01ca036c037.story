A lorry driver who admitted sending texts at the wheel killed a mother-of-one when he crashed into her car while speeding.

Jasvinder Arora, 44, was jailed for three and a half years yesterday after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.

The lorry driver admitted he had made two calls and sent and received text messages as he drove his articulated truck at 55mph - 5mph above the speed limit for his vehicle - on the A14 near Ipswich, Suffolk.

Moments later he ploughed into Carmen Bucur's Vauxhall Corsa, which was being towed at around 10 to 15mph by a Ford Transit van after it had broken down.

Ms Bucur, 33, was killed in the crash and her friend in the passenger seat Maricica Racu broke five ribs. They had both been sitting in the car as it was towed, Ipswich Crown court heard.

Ms Bucur, who has a seven-year-old daughter, had only arrived in the UK six days before the crash on May 10 last year.

She was working as a cleaner and sending money back to her family in her native Romania.

She and her friend had plans to start their own cleaning business and were on their way to an appointment with a potential employer when their car broke down.

It was not known whether Arora, who had a Bluetooth device in his cab, was using his phone when he crashed, the court was told.

But Michael Crimp, prosecuting, said that as the driver rounded a shallow bend he 
would have had an eight-second view of the road ahead where there was 
nothing between him and the Corsa.

'In those seconds for whatever reason he doesn't appear to have spotted the hazard in front of him,' he said.

He accused the lorry driver of 'gross inattention' and said that the phone calls had caused him to stop focusing on the road.

'Whatever the subject matter of the 
telephone calls was, that's where his mind was rather than concentrating
on the road ahead of him,' he added.

Arora, from Feltham, west London, admitted causing death by careless driving but was convicted of the more serious offence of causing death by dangerous driving.

Giving evidence during the trial, he said he had 'misjudged' the situation and had only seen the Corsa when he was 60ft away.

Although he admitted making the calls and sending messages, he denied he was distracted.

As well as being jailed for three and a half years he was 
banned from driving for three years and ordered to take an extended 
retest.
