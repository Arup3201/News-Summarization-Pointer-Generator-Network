Samsung's smart TVs made the headlines earlier this week when its privacy policy suggested the sets are capable of listening to private conversations.

It caused such a furore that the South Korean tech giant has since issued a blog post clarifying its policy and vehemently denying the claims.

But now it faces further problems after users began complaining the TVs have started randomly showing adverts during the middle of movies.

Samsung smart TV users have complained their sets have started showing a Pepsi advert while watching movies on the Foxtel, and Plex apps. The advert covers half the screen and disrupts the film. Samsung told MailOnline it is making an investigation into the fault its 'top priority'

Concerns about the adverts appeared on Monday by users of the Australian TV app Foxtel, available on Samsung smart TVs, reports Gigaom.

One user wrote: 'After about 15 minutes of watching live TV, the screen goes blank and then a Pepsi advert - taking up about half the screen - pops up and stops Foxtel playing.

'It's as if there is a popup ad on the TV. I have not installed any other software or apps.'

The same issue was also reported by at least five other people on a separate thread. 

It was initially thought to be a problem with the Foxtel app, but another forum member said he didn't have Foxtel installed on his Samsung TV but was experiencing the same issue.

Furthermore, a Redditor said they had also been shown a Pepsi advert while watching films on the Plex app on their Samsung smart TV.

Earlier this week, Samsung was criticised over claims its smart TVs can capture 'personal or other sensitive' conversations (policy extract pictured)

User NexVentor wrote on Monday that they had been using Plex for two months and the advert had never appeared before. 

'Every movie I play, 20 to 30 minutes in, it plays the Pepsi ad. It has happened on six movies today.'

On the Foxtel thread, a company employee responded: 'This absolutely should not be happening and has been escalated immediately.'

Samsung told MailOnline: 'We are aware of a situation that has caused some smart TV users in Australia to experience program interruption in the form of an advertisement.

'This seems to be caused by an error, and we are currently conducting a full and thorough investigation into the cause as our top priority. 

'We would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by our customers.'

Earlier this week, The Daily Beast highlighted a line in Samsung's smart TV privacy policy that suggested its voice recognition technology has the potential to listen to conversations and capture 'personal or other sensitive information'.

Following the news, Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins tweeted that the Samsung terminology is similar to an excerpt from George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984.

At the time of the initial claims, a Samsung spokesman told MailOnline it takes consumer privacy very seriously and that 'any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency. The firm has since posted a blog post further clarifying that its smart TVs 'do not monitor living room conversations'

At the time of the initial claims, a Samsung spokesman told MailOnline it takes consumer privacy very seriously and that 'any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency'. 

The firm has since posted a blog post further clarifying where it stands on the issue. 

'Samsung smart TVs do not monitor living room conversations,' said the firm.

Voice recognition lets the user control the TV using voice commands. 

It has to be activated in the first instance, and can be deactivated at any time. 

Samsung 'listens' for voice commands and then sends them, along with information about the device,  to a company called Nuance Communications.

This service converts speech to text and the TV uses this text to search for content or carry out a task, for example.

In addition, Samsung said it may collect and capture voice commands and associated texts for future use, so it can improve the features.

Once enabled, Samsung told MailOnline that the voice data only consists of TV commands, or search sentences, only. 

Users can recognise if the voice recognition feature is activated because a microphone icon appears on the screen.

A spokesman continued that Samsung doesn't sell voice data to third parties and the voice data is sent to a server, which searches for the requested content then sends it to the TV.

He did not explain what happens to the captured data once it is no longer needed, and MailOnline has contacted Samsung for further information.  

It continued that language used in the policy -particularly the line: 'Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition - has led to confusion.

To clarify its position, Samsung explained: 'If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. 

'To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some voice commands may be transmitted to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text.

'In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.'

And the firm stressed that it only collects voice commands when users make a specific search request to the smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on their screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control.

If people don't enable the feature, they can't use the interactive features, but users can disable recognition data at any time in the Settings menu.

Samsung has still not explained what it does with the data it collects, and how long it keeps it for. 

Plus, at the time of writing, it hasn't updated the wording of the privacy policy to make this clearer.  

Yesterday, Microsoft's Xbox console was among other devices accused of snooping on users. 

Kinect-controlled Xboxes listen to everything around them, silently waiting for commands such as ‘Xbox on’ or instructions to play games including Tomb Raider or Halo.

The technology means people can play games or watch catch-up TV without using the remote control.

The news follows years of concerns about how much data smart TV sets and voice recognition technology capture and send.

In 2012, Malta-based security firm ReVuln posted a video showing how its researchers had learned to crack a Samsung television to access its settings - including any personal information stored on it. 

With such malware installed, hackers could use the  TV's built-in microphones and camera to hear and see everything in front of it. 

Last summer, a Which? investigation then discovered just how much data the manufacturers can gather. 

Experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart TVs made by LG, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba.  

All the brands tracked people’s viewing habits to some extent, and users had agreed to this when they accepted the TVs terms and conditions.  

Most of data collected was encrypted to hide it from hackers, but a Samsung TV disclosed the tester’s location and postcode.

The firm told Which? that location is needed to operate the TV, but that a postcode isn’t required.
