Christina Phillips, 22, from South Haven, Mississippi, weighed 639lb or 45st 7lb, and was barely able to walk when she underwent dangerous bypass surgery in bid to save her life.

And despite a litany of complications, including overcoming food addiction, Christina has managed to shed 19st and reclaim her independence.

Miserable: Despite being just 22 years old, Christina was forced to live an isolated life because of her weight

Her new life is a far cry from her previous existence, which saw her leading an isolated life at home because of her weight.

So large had Christina become, she wasn't even able to cook for herself, leaving her dependent on her mother and husband Zach for even the most basic needs.

‘I never thought I would get this big,' she confesses. 'I was always home, rarely did I get out. I was trapped inside this body that I didn’t want to be in.

She added: ‘Just simply walking from the living room to the kitchen was hard and I felt like my knees are going to collapse. I couldn’t even drive anymore.'

Dependent: Confined to the couch or her bed, Christina was forced to rely on her mother and husband

Unable to move more than a few metres and with multiple health problems, her mother Tammie and her husband, Zach were forced to bath and cook for her, and even helped her to dress - much to Christina's humiliation.

‘When I was about 18 I started getting these tumour-like masses on my legs,' she explains. 'It disgusts me to look at my legs.

‘When the lymphedema came on that was the turning point; that was when things got really bad. After I got married my weight went up by 300lb. It was out of control and I’m too young to be living like this.

Speaking on TLC show My 600lb Life ahead of her life-saving gastric surgery, she added: 'I’m only 22 - I don’t want to die.

'I haven’t even had the chance to experience life yet.  I just sit at home on my laptop or watching TV, and eating all day.

‘My fear is I will just keep getting bigger and bigger until I die and my heart stops. It is terrifying.'

Couple: Christina with her husband Zach who, according to doctors, enabled her to get bigger

Christina's problems began in early childhood and by the time she was 12, she already tipped the scales at a whopping 21st.

‘I
 have always been bigger,' she reveals. 'In the seventh grade I was close to 300lb.'

Speaking about the reasons for her weight gain, she reveals: 'My 
parents used to fight a lot when I was younger. It was scary. I think 
that might be part of the reason I turned to food.

‘When
 I was 17 I stepped on the scale and I was close to 400lb and I just 
couldn’t believe it. I never thought I would weigh that much.

‘I
 was oldest of all my siblings and all the fighting, shouting
 and yelling made me feel like it was my job to protect my brother and 
my sister.'

Terrifying: Christina was warned that she could be dead in five years if she failed to lose weight

Her weight problem worsened after she met her husband Zach and piled on another 300lb after the wedding.

Nevertheless, he explains, Christina's weight has never bothered him - even though she weighed 28st when they first met.

‘Her
 weight never bothered me,' he reveals. She’s smart, pretty; you 
couldn’t ask for anyone better. It was love at first sight.

‘If
 she wants something I go out and get it for her because I love her and 
she asks for it. I mean I’m scared to death of losing her but at the 
same time I don’t want to make her mad.'

Now, with her health failing and her life made miserable, Christina has turned to gastric surgery in a bid to lose the weight.

Much better: Christina was housebound and covered in lumps but is now slimmer and much healthier

Admitted to the hospital, she was put on a 1,000 calorie a day diet  and underwent gastric bypass surgery, leaving the the hospital days later.

A year after surgery, Christina has shed 266lbs and is able to sleep in the same bed as her husband for the first time in years.

'I used to hide from the world but now I can’t wait to get out there,' she reveals. 'My relationship with food has changed completely, it’s much better.

'I’m not tempted by foods I used to be able to eat. My family are eating better and helping me make the right choices with what I eat.'

With her lymphedemas and 600lb life a thing of the past, Christina has also started exploring the possibility of attending the local college.

‘One of my dreams has always been to get a job as a nurse and I can finally see myself making that a reality,' she says. 'I’m getting closer to all of my goals.'
