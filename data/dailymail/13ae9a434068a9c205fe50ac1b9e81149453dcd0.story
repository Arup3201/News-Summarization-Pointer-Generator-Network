A 15-year-old girl was branded a hero after her quick thinking saved an 18-month-old boy who had been kidnapped by her schizophrenic mother.

Camryn Wood was in a car with her father in Olympia, Washington, when she received an Amber Alert on her phone saying a youngster had been abducted. 

The text included the make, model and licence plate number of the suspect's car and is sent to all smart phones in the area.

Less than a minute later, she noticed the vehicle in question was right in front of them and drug addict Cassandra Wilhelm was behind the wheel with her son Mason in her lap, according to KIRO 7.

Rescued: 18-month-old Mason Wilhelm was kidnapped by her schizophrenic, drug addict mother, but was saved by police thanks to the quick thinking of a teenage girl in Olympia, Washington 

Hero: Camryn Wood was in a car with her father in Olympia, Washington, when she received an Amber Alert on her phone saying a youngster had been abducted. She told her father to follow the vehicle and called 911

The 34-year-old, who police say was addicted to pills and heroin, had taken the boy earlier in the day after assaulting her estranged husband.

Camryn told her father, who was driving at the time, to follow the car before she dialed 911.

Wilhem noticed she was being tailed and started driving in a number of different directions. But the Woods managed to corner her in a hotel parking lot.

There Wilhem was arrested while her son was rescued and taken back to his father. 

'We just followed them,' Wood told the station. 'They jumped on the freeway, they were making all sorts of turns. We were trying to not make it obvious that we were behind them.' 

'Actually seeing you can make a difference and help somebody get their kid, that means the world to me.'

Wilhem is now facing kidnapping and assault charges after she attacked her estranged husband earlier in the day.

Detectives say it was the quickest reaction to an Amber Alert they have ever seen and officers reportedly cheered in the emergency response center when the baby had been saved.  

After police were alerted less than a minute after Mason was abducted, the Woods cornered his mother Cassandra Wilhem allowing police to arrest her. She had also assaulted her estranged husband that day

The suspect had the child in her lap in this dark blue Dodge and had tried to flee on the freeway
