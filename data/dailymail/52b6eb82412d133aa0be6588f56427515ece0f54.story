A brick tycoon is suing a top QC who pulled out of buying his £3.6million country manor after claiming it was riddled with damp and dry rot.

Leading barrister William Griffiths QC and his wife Angela thought they had found their dream home when they viewed Laughton Manor in Lewes, East Sussex in 2010.

The 30-room mansion is set in 12 acres of countryside and its architecture has been compared to that of Queen Victoria's much-loved summer home, Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

Laughton Manor, in East Sussex, which Mr and Mrs Griffiths had originally agreed to buy for £3.6million, before pulling out saying it was 'riddled with damp and dry rot' 

Mr Griffiths, 66, a planning and property lawyer and a committee member of the MCC agreed to exchange contracts on the property with then owners Alan Hardy and his wife Juliet in April 2011.

However the QC and his wife did not see a surveyor's report on the mansion until after the contracts has been exchanged.

After receiving the survey in May 2012, Mr and Mrs Griffiths 'rescinded' the contract and refused to complete the purchase.

They insisted they had been the victims of 'reckless misrepresentation' by the then owners.

They claimed that, rather than being the 'pristine' dream home they expected, the survey revealed that the 150-year-old Victorian manor was badly affected by 'rising damp and wet and dry rot', which would cost up to £600,000 to remedy.

Mr Hardy, who flies a helicopter, and his wife are now suing Mr and Mrs Griffiths at London's High Court for a six-figure sum over their refusal to go through with the sale, alleging breach of contract.

Jonathan Seitler QC, for Mr and Mrs Hardy, told Judge Amanda Tipples QC, that Laughton Manor is a magnificent property, built in 1853, with 30 rooms on four storeys.

It has an Italianate tower similar to that of Osborne house, and boasts a helicopter pad, gym, cinema and staff quarters.

It was on the market for £4.5million and Mr and Mrs Griffiths had agreed to buy it for £3.6million, before reading the surveyor's report.

Mr Seitler told the judge that the contract contained a 'common' clause used in conveyancing, whereby the QC and his wife promised to accept and pay for the property based on its state of repair at the time of signing.

He added that having agreed to the contract, with the clause in place, the couple were legally bound to go ahead with the purchase, and must now pay damages for failing to do so.

Mr Seitler said: 'Merely describing the size of the property and the age of the property, it was obvious that there was always going to be some damp in this property somewhere.

'The question is how obvious that would have been to a lay person.

'The vendor is obliged to inform the purchaser of latent structural defects of which he is aware, (but) the buyer accepts the physical condition of the property at the date of the contract.

'The purchasers were entitled to opt in or out of the conditions as they chose. In this case the contract is binding.

The house was on the market for £4.5million and Mr and Mrs Griffiths had agreed to buy it for £3.6million before reading a surveyor's report 

'These clauses are very common. The vendor is a lay person in matters of law...the purchaser is an eminent QC with property expertise.

'There is no suggestion that the vendor had to sell or the purchaser had to buy.

'The property was accepted in the physical state it was in at the time of contract and you can't go back on that now.

'If it is damp, it is accepted with damp. It cannot be rejected post-exchange on grounds like this,' he concluded.

But Stephen Brown, for Mr and Mrs Griffiths, disputed the meaning of the controversial clause in the contract, and accused the sellers of 'reckless misrepresentation' in relation to the state of the house before contracts were exchanged.

He said: 'It was assumed by Mr and Mrs Griffiths that they were buying a pristine property.

Laughton Manor was originally built between 1760 and 1780 although it is unknown how much of the original building remains.

It was bought by Sir James Duke Bart, a Lord Mayor and Sheriff of London in the 1840s.

He was a close friend of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and admired their summer residence of Osborne House, which also has a similar Italian style tower to Laughton Manor.

The Duke's family lived in the property for more than 70 years and it was sold in 1911 to a private buyer.

In 1930 it was bought by the Ministry of Health, who used it as an office until the 1990s.

It was then bought over and restored to its former glory by a private owner.

'They didn't want to have to spend a lot of money on the inside of the house, (but) our survey suggests a reduction of £600,000 to take account of the problems with the property.

'Part of the misrepresentations was that they had fully refurbished the house and that it didn't suffer from damp or rot.'

The barrister added: 'The place had substantial rising damp and wet and dry rot. The property has been materially misrepresented to them in light of the surveyor's report.'

Mr Brown said that the report indicated there was 'extensive rising damp, dry rot and timber decay which may affect the structural integrity of the house,' mainly focused in the lower ground floor of the building.

Mr and Mrs Griffiths had also objected to the sale of a plot of land adjacent to the property to another buyer, the court heard.

Welshman Mr Griffiths attended Haverfordwest Grammar School, before graduating from Oxford. He was called to the bar in 1974 and made a silk in 1993.

His areas of expertise include planning and property law, and he has been called 'one of the sharpest barristers in the land' by The Times.

A surveyor's report indicated that there was 'extensive rising damp, dry rot and timber decay' which may affect the structure of the house 

He also plays a leading role in the MCC and was a trustee of the Lords Taverners.

Mr Seitler said outside court that Laughton Manor has now been sold to another purchaser for the same £3.6m price.

Mr Hardy now lives in Lewes with his wife, manages a church, and has business interests valued at £17m.

The High Court hearing continues.
