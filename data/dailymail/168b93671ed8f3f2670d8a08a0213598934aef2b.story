Questions have been raised over whether Theresa May met secretly with the Senate intelligence committee as it investigated CIA torture

Questions have been raised over whether Theresa May made a secret visit to a US committee probing CIA torture, amid claims the Government has been frantically 'lobbying' to keep Britain out of the damning report.

Yesterday, The Mail published details of how the Home Secretary was among politicians and diplomats who held meetings with the Senate intelligence committee, while it was investigating the barbaric techniques inflicted on terror suspects.

The information about the meeting - said to be one of 23 involving British diplomats over the past six years - was released under Freedom of Information laws by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

But last night, the Government issued an extraordinary clarification, stating it had made a 'clerical error' and that Mrs May had not met with the committee when it initially said she had.

But, after the U-turn, officials admitted they could not confirm whether Mrs May may have met leading members on subsequent visits in later years.

In a statement released today, the FCO said: ‘Due to a clerical error, which we very much regret, the FCO’s FOI response of 1 August on contacts with the US Senate select committee on intelligence referred to a meeting between the committee and the Home Secretary in July 2011. 

'That was a mistake: her planned visit in July 2011 did not take place and was postponed until September 2011.

'On that reinstated visit in September 2011, she did not meet the committee.’  

As revealed yesterday, William Hague, then foreign secretary, and spy agencies MI5 and MI6 were among a string of politicians and diplomats who held discussions with the committee about any redactions that might be needed to protect ‘national security’.

In the end, there was not a single mention of any of the UK security and intelligence services when the explosive document was published on Tuesday.

On Thursday, in a surprise development, Number Ten changed its story over the talks with the committee.

Asked on Wednesday about requested redactions, David Cameron’s official spokesman said there had been ‘none whatsoever, to my knowledge’.

But yesterday his deputy said: ‘My understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition.

'But I think there was a conversation with the agencies and their US counterparts on the executive summary.

‘Any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report.’

The rest of list released by the Foreign Office details how senior ministers and diplomats met members of the committee 23 times in six years – equivalent to once every three months.

This remarkable access will raise fresh questions about the influence successive British governments tried to exert to ensure the country was not tainted by the revelations.

It has fuelled concerns that the UK pushed for key parts of the report referring to Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean leased to the US military, to be redacted.

Ministers have admitted that the island was a stopover for extraordinary rendition flights – in which terror suspects were moved to secret prisons around the world to be tortured. Yet the summary of the heavily censored report, published this week, did not contain a single mention of UK involvement.

Critics suspect topics for the talks included whether British involvement in or knowledge of US actions was mentioned.

Lord West, then the Labour security minister, met senators in October 2009. And Sir Peter Westmacott, ambassador to the US, and his predecessor Sir Nigel Sheinwald curried favour with the committee on 22 occasions.

They met its chairman Dianne Feinstein six times. A cluster of meetings came as the committee took crucial decisions on how much of the report should be made public.

The UK has repeatedly denied complicity in the CIA’s torture of Islamist terror suspects.

Notably, two senators met by the UK ambassadors denounced the report on Tuesday. Jim Risch and Marco Rubio both said it will put lives in danger.

Significantly, the FOI answer admits the list of talks is ‘not exhaustive’ and does not include ‘brush-by meetings’.

Donald Campbell, of human rights group Reprieve, said: ‘The huge number of meetings . . . suggests a determined lobbying effort. We know Britain was involved in the CIA’s rendition programme, so it seems reasonable to assume these meetings focused on keeping embarrassing information about the UK’s role secret.

‘The Government has serious questions to answer over whether it lobbied to keep its involvement in this shameful affair under wraps.’

Mrs May will face close questioning about any discussions she had with senators on Monday when she is due to appear before MPs on the Commons home affairs committee. 

The Home Office declined to comment last night.

An earlier version of this article stated that Theresa May had met with the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in July 2011. The Foreign Office have asked to clarify that, due to a clerical error on their part, Ms May did not meet the Committee.
