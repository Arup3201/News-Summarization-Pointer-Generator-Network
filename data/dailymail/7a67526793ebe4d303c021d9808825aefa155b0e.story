The Norwegian right-wing extremist who confessed to a bombing and shooting massacre that killed 77 people tried to give a speech describing him as a resistance leader at his first public court hearing today - but was cut off by the judge.

Wearing a dark suit, Anders Behring Breivik was escorted by guards into an Oslo court room packed with dozens of reporters and members of the public.

They included survivors and families of his victims who were able to see him face-to-face for the first time since the bloody rampage.

Breivik began portraying himself as 
the 'commander' of a Norwegian resistance movement and rejected the 
court's authority to hear his case before the judge interrupted him and 
told him to stick to the issue at hand.

Speaking at a court just two blocks 
from where he detonated a huge homemade bomb, he said: 'I am a military 
commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar 
Norway.

'Regarding the competence (of the court), I object to it because 
you received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideology 
(and) because it supports multiculturalism.'

He acknowledged carrying out the 
massacre, but refused to plead guilty to terror charges. He claims he is 
in a state of war to protect Europe from being taken over by Muslim 
immigrants.

'I acknowledge the acts but I do not plead guilty,' Breivik told the court.

Breivik, speaking at a court picketed 
by a group of protesters holding a banner that read 'No speakers' 
platform for fascists', attempted to address survivors and victims' 
relatives, but the court denied his request.

Speaking after the hearing, Bjoern 
Ihle, 20, from Oslo, said: 'He aimed at me on Utoeya Island. That was 
the last time I saw him.

'It is good to see he was powerless, 
which he was not then. He looked nervous and weakened. It was a 
different experience than when I saw him at Utoeya.'    

Most of the island victims were in 
their teens or 20s and some were shot at point-blank range or while 
trying to swim to safety.  

Daniel Vister, another survivor, said Breivik looked weak and his rant showed he was mentally ill.        

'I think that what he said there shows that he is completely mad. He is definitely not on this planet.  

'I didn't think he would look like that ... he was very big then and he now looked so flimsy,' he said.                

In a rambling manifesto posted on the 
Internet before the attacks, Breivik wrote that his arrest would open 
'the propaganda phase' of his operation to ignite a war to defend Europe
against a supposed Muslim takeover.

The hearing, required under Norwegian 
law to keep a suspect in prison before trial, was Breivik's fourth, and 
as expected, the court decided to keep him in custody for a further 12 
weeks.

He will likely remain in prison until he goes to trial, probably in the first half of next year.

About 120 people were admitted to the 
courtroom, while hundreds of others squeezed into overflow rooms 
equipped with video links.    

Breivik has been kept in solitary 
confinement since July 22 and has been denied visits, correspondence and
access to newspapers and television.

The prosecution asked the court to ease those restrictions slightly on Monday, but the judge declined.      

At the end of today's hearing, however, the judge lifted a ban on reporting on the proceedings.

Investigators say Breivik set off a 
fertilizer bomb outside the government headquarters on July 22, killing 
eight people, before heading to an island retreat, where youth sections 
of Norway’s governing Labour Party were gathered for their annual summer
camp.

Disguised as a police officer, he opened fire on scores of panicked youth, shooting some of them as they fled into the lake.

Sixty-nine people were killed on Utoeya island before Breivik surrendered to a police SWAT team.

The carnage left Norway shocked and continues to haunt a nation that sees itself as peaceful and tolerant.

An online manifesto attributed to 
Breivik sheds light on his choice of targets. In it, he lays out a 
blueprint for a multi-phase revolution, targeting left-leaning political
elites he accuses of destroying their own societies by admitting large 
numbers of immigrants, especially from Muslim countries.

His actions were widely condemned, including by the anti-Islamic bloggers and groups that he cited prolifically in the document.

Oil-producing Norway, home to the 
Nobel Peace Prize, is known for its open society and relative 
prosperity, but the attacks sparked a public debate about immigration, 
security and a legal system which never had to cope with such an event.
