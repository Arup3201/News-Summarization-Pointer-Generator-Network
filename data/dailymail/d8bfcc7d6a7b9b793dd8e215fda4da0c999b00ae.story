When scores of dead seals with mysterious 'corkscrew' injuries began washing up on shores, all sorts of theories were put forward.

Boat propellers were the chief suspect, although hungry sharks and attacks by aggressive territorial male seals weren't ruled out.

Scientists, the National Trust, RSPCA and even police investigated the disturbing phenomenon.

But now academics believe they have found the answer – cannibalism.

Cannibalism victim: One of the 50 bloodied seals washed up dead on beaches across Britain. Experts now believe the fatal injuries were caused by hungry adult males 

A team of marine biologists concluded the horrific lacerations – likened to be being passed through a giant pencil sharpener - could have been caused by hungry adult males.

Dr David Thompson, senior research assistant at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, said: 'Our investigations have led us to believe that it is highly likely cannibalism was the cause.'

Scientists were stumped by the deaths of more than 50 grey and common seals found on an eight-mile stretch of coast between Wells and Blakeney on the Norfolk coast between November 2009 and August 2010.

The problem was also identified in Scotland. In the Firth of Tay, seven seals were found dead out of a breeding population of only 150. Another 18 were discovered in St Andrews Bay and the Firth of Forth.

All had the unusual injuries - a smooth-edged cut that spiralled up to two times around the body.

Post-mortem examinations failed to provide an answer but researchers guessed the likely cause was a rotating single blade. Seals normally swim away from noisy boats but they theorised they could be sucked in by an as yet unidentified vessel.

The breakthrough came after a student researcher at St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit saw an adult seal force a pup under water.

Under attack: The common seal (left) and grey seals (right) are believed to have been viciously attacked by hungry adult males. The corkscrew injuries were initially blamed on boat propellers until an expert witnessed an attack on a pup which resulted in similar lacerations

During the brutal attack, it held its victim with its fore-flippers and clamped its jaws around its neck. It then pulled upward while pushing down with the flippers, leaving the corkscrew incision.

Dr Thompson – whose team tagged a number of grey seals in the Firth of Forth for the study - added about six a year had been found dead with the same injuries for the past two years.

'Seal cannibalism is rare but not unheard of and our research has shown evidence of seals killing this way back in the late 1980s,' he said.

'We can't be 100 per cent certain this is what happened in Norfolk but we believe it is highly likely to be the case.'

Wells harbour master Robert Smith said: 'People here are very passionate about seals and we took a lot of stick at the time when people thought it was the wind farm boats causing the deaths.

'It's nice to be able to show that this was not the case.'

David Balston, of the UK Chamber of Shipping, added: 'While the horrific injuries remain a cause for concern, the evidence that these were predominantly the result of attacks by other seals demonstrates why accurate science should drive the debate rather than raw emotion.'

The deaths were of particular concern because populations of common seals had already been devastated.

Outbreaks of the phocine distemper virus in 1988 and 2002 resulted in losses of around 20 per cent. Numbers have made a slow recovery since then.
