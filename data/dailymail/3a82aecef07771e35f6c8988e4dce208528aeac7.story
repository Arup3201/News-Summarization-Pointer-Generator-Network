A transgender person who had a £10,000 sex change  to become a woman, but now wants to become a man again, has criticised the NHS for not doing enough to make sure he wanted the initial surgery.

Matthew Attonley, 30, was born a boy and seven years ago started surgery to become a woman called Chelsea, but in the last six months he has taken steps to return to being a man called Matthew.  

He now wants the British health service to fund the £14,000 reversal process because he claims they didn't complete a rigorous enough mental evaluation before allowing him to go through the initial process.

Matthew Attonley, 30, who was born a boy, claims he had a £10,000 of medical help on the NHS to become a woman. He now wants the taxpayer to foot a further £14,000 bill to become a fully-functioning man again

He said: 'It's definitely not checked enough.

'People will hate me for that, but you have to live two full years as a woman to prove to the NHS that you are ready and there isn't enough psychiatric evaluation. 

'In the real life experience - those two years, I think maybe you should have a year of intensive weekly therapy just to keep pushing you, to keep checking you, keeping tabs. 

'Not just meetings every month or three months, or by letters or emails, but by intensive therapy.' 

After becoming a woman, Matthew  became tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and he now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. 

Matthew said he had struggled with his identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child he would dress up in women's clothes.

In his twenties, he became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration.

An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Matthew into a spiral of depression, he said.

But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with his idol in a nightclub in 2007.

The glamour model told him to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to his GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000.

But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Matthew wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill.

Matthew, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine last week that he finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels he has never been fully accepted as a real woman.

Matthew, now living in London, was shocked to find out how many more social restraints are placed on women than men and admits he longed to be as free as a man. 

Appearing on This Morning earlier today to defend his comments, he said: 'Going from male to female, they are two completely different gender roles in society - I found I had to be different with men completely.

Matthew is now embracing life as a man again, after feeling the restrictions on acting feminine too stifling 

'Girls were still the same, but guys start opening doors for you and all of those great things, but then you do have to conform to society pressures as a girl.

'So being male again, it's quite freeing actually, just to be able to live.'   

He is now aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and an intensive course of medicine and hormones at a total cost of £14,000.

He said: 'I still have a male anatomy but have had gender altering treatment.

'It is an intensive course of hormones and testosterone blockers that gets you ready for surgery (to become a woman). 

'It makes testicles shrink to the size of garden peas and makes you dry up in time for surgery.

'I'm trying to reverse it but it's going to be a battle because it has been almost ten years. 

Matthew on This Morning earlier today:  

'I still have a penis but it doesn't function in the same way, it can get  a semi-erection but it has still got to build back up.

'Because now I want to be male, I want to be the best male I can be, just like with a female, so hopefully I have to see with doctors if we can get it fully functioning.'

Although Matthew now wants to have a fully-functioning male body, he is adamant that he would still love to be a woman if it could be a foolproof transformation. 

He said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie.

'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman.

'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too.

'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.'

Matthew, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says he does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for his reversion.

'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' he said.

'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS.

'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through.

'I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice.

'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.'

Matthew, who changed his name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says he gradually began having doubts about the sex change.

He said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't.

'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man.

'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.'

Matthew said living as a woman is exhausting.

'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman.

'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl.

Matthew said he had always struggled with his identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child he would dress up in women's clothes, and in his twenties he became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu

'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.'

He said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack.

He said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable.

'I had to go back to living as Matthew.'

Matthew has already had testosterone injections to begin his transition to becoming a man again.

He has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair.

He added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me.

'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.'

The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again.

Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations.

'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.'
