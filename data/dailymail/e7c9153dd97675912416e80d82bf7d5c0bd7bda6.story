A cyclist outraged by the bad behaviour of his fellow bikers has captured their dangerous moves on camera and created a montage of the incidents which include jumping red lights, cutting up motorists and using mobile phones while pedalling.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from other cyclists, has spent the last three weeks filming the footage in York city centre and has posted it on the internet to highlight the misdemeanors.

The most startling incident shows a cyclist going head-over-heels on a main road when he attempts to take off his jacket while on the move.

The cyclist said he was fed up of other bikers ignoring the Highway Code and filmed their moves to highlight the dangers. One man was spotted attempting to take his coat off while riding along a busy road, pictured

The footage, filmed by a disgruntled cyclist in York, caught on camera the moment a man attempted to take his jacket off while cycling on the road but ended up toppling head-over-heels and crashing the ground

The cyclist, who apparently escaped uninjured, crashed to the floor after cycling while trying to take his coat off

The jacket gets caught in the cyclist's front wheel and he ends up performing a somersault on the busy street - right in front of a fellow biker who captures the whole incident on his head cam

The jacket gets caught in the cyclist's front wheel and he ends up performing a somersault on the busy street - going straight over his handle bars and crashing to the ground.

Other misdemeanours featured on the three-minute video entitled 'York Cyclists' include bikers cutting-up motorists, riding without their hands on the handlebars, going the wrong way up one-way streets, using their mobile phones while pedalling, riding on footpaths and jumping red lights.

The man said he has been cycling in York for 30 years and has become increasingly concerned about the reckless behaviour of some cyclists.

‘I am tired of watching cyclists breaking the rules of the Highway Code and endangering not only themselves but other road users,’ he said.

The man also spotted several people talking on their mobile phones while cycling, pictured, or attempting to text while keeping one hand on the bike

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of any backlash from other cyclists, bought the head cam to film the incidents after getting fed up of the behaviour of his fellow bikers

The anonymous man said he was fed up with other cyclists ignoring the highways code - like this biker who cycled straight through a red light

He revealed his short film was only the first episode and he would be creating more - not just about bad cycling but also bad behaviour by motorists and even pedestrians.

It comes just days after new bike lights which display the international symbol of the cyclist were introduced.

Hailed a breakthrough in road safety, the ‘Brainy Bike Lights’, by Professor Crawford Hollingworth, use bright LED lighting to allow motorists to see bikers quicker.

Around 19,000 cyclists are injured in accidents in the UK each year, with six killed in London over a 14 day period last year.

The most common bike collision involves cars and taxis hitting cyclists from behind.

The three minute video entitled 'York Cyclists' also shows bikers cutting up drivers and not paying attention to the road as they cycle along

Other clips from the video show cyclists riding with no hands, pictured, driving the wrong way down a one-way street and riding on pavements

Around 19,000 cyclists are injured in accidents in the UK each year, with six killed in London over just 14 days last year

In 2012, a total of 105 adult cyclists and 13 children were killed on roads in Great Britain, while a further 16,788 adults and 2,185 children were injured.

Just last week a cyclist was killed in London after colliding with a lorry at an accident blackspot.

The man was apparently hit by the waste truck at the Ludgate circus junction at the bottom of Fleet Street, where six others have died since 2008.

Last autumn six cyclists were killed on London's roads in just two weeks leading to calls for more money to be invested in cycle lanes and safety measures.

Statistics compiled by the Department for Transport reveal a 10 per cent increase in cyclist fatalities from 2011 to 2012 and a 4 per cent rise in serious injuries.

The main said he has been cycling in York for 30 years and had become increasingly concerned about the reckless behaviour of some cyclists - including some who continue to cycle on the pavement
