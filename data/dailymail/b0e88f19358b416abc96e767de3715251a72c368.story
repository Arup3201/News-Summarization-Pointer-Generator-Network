The right of people from across Europe could be curtailed under David Cameron's plans to overhaul Britain's relationship with Brussels.

The Prime Minister has drawn up a 'battleplan' for talks with other EU countries in which he wants to claw back powers over who can move to Britain, find work and claim benefits.

Mr Cameron is already under pressure to urged to slash benefits and access to public services for immigrants from Europe, but Downing Street suggested he could go further.

Pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron is ready to look at freedom of movement rules which allow anyone from in the EU to settle in Britain

Mr Cameron will use a meeting of European leaders next week to step up pressure for reform, demanding major cuts to red tape which threaten competitiveness.

But the government is under pressure to do more to tackle the 'pull factors' which draw thousands of people to Britain every year.

A new study reveals a
 sharp rise in the number of EU migrants without a job living in Britain
 to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow.

There
 was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants
 in the country in the three years to 2011, according to the European 
Commission.

Asked if the government was now examining ways to curb the freedom of movement rules - allowing people from anywhere in the EU to settle in Britain - Downing Street confirmed it was on the table.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I think it is understandable that in the UK and a number of other countries, questions are being asked in this area.

'We have a programme underway, bilateral discussions with other member states. It is not right to pre-empt that now.'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is already working with other member states on plans to toughen the habitual residence test to make it harder for immigrants to claim benefits.

Mr Cameron’s spokesman added: ‘The government’s view clearly is changes do need to be made in this area and actually the fact that we are co-operating and working in partnership with a good number of other member states I think is significant.’

He added that there are ‘widespread concerns’ across Europe about access to state benefits and public servants of migrants.

‘We don’t think that the current system is working in the right way. By definition we are seeking to take action on these pull factors.

‘There is an issue here fundamentally with regard to access to the welfare system and others around fairness.’

European Commission figures show there has been a 73 per cent increase in 'job-seeking' EU immigrants

Meanwhile, a poll has found that two-thirds of the public want ministers to take ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration.

London
 Mayor Boris Johnson said migrants should have to work for ‘quite a long
 time’ before they can claim any benefits in this country.

The
 London Mayor said it was wrong that ‘we have no control over the time 
lapse between arrival in this country to work and the ability to 
withdraw benefits’.

And he 
suggested the Prime Minister should press for a change in the law as 
part of his renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU.

‘That
 is something that could be considered by the Government for the 
renegotiation of the European Treaty that is about to come up,’ he said.

Tory
 MP Douglas Carswell also called for a clampdown, saying that migrants 
appeared to be fleeing to Britain to escape the eurozone crisis.

‘We
 cannot both continue the free-at-the-point-of-use welfare state and 
benefits system and allow Europeans to flee the eurozone and come here,’
 the Eurosceptic MP added.

The European Commission study, 
published today, reveals that in 2012 there were 611,779  economically 
‘non-active’ EU migrants living in Britain – up from 431,687 six years 
ago. The annual cost to the NHS of treating ‘non-active’ migrants is 
estimated at £1.5billion. The Commission’s  291-page report sheds new 
light on the impact of EU immigration on Britain.

‘Between
 2006 and 2012 there has been a steady increase of 42 per cent in the 
number of non-active EU migrants in the UK,’ it says.

‘A
 particularly high increase can be noticed between 2009 and 2011. The 
number of job-seeking EU migrants increased by 73 per cent, while the 
total EU migrant population increased by only 28 per cent.’ The report 
was commissioned by Laszlo Andor, the Commission’s employment 
commissioner, who is suing Britain over rules that mean some benefits 
are not immediately available to EU migrants.

A Commission spokesman said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest the report’s findings meant there are 600,000 unemployed migrants, because the figure includes older children, students, pensioners and other economically inactive adults.

‘All existing studies without any exceptions say that EU migrants are more likely to be in work than the native population and make a positive contribution to the Exchequer,’ he added.

Despite the evidence it uncovers, the report concludes that the impact of ‘non-active’ immigrants on the benefits system is ‘very low’.

67% of public want 'drastic action' to cut immigration

52% of voters say they are more likely to back party promising to cut immigration 'significantly'

But Stephen Booth, of the think-tank Open Europe, said the conclusion was ‘misleading… wilfully or otherwise’.

A poll carried out for Sky News by Survation suggests the public want ministers to take a much tougher stance on immigration.

Sixty-seven
 per cent said the UK’s population is too high and want ‘drastic action’
 to cut immigration, while 52 per cent said they are more likely to vote
 for a party promising to reduce immigration ‘significantly’. And 27 per
 cent said the wave of immigration in the last decade had brought no 
benefit to Britain.

Seventy-four
 per cent said they were concerned that Romanians and Bulgarians will be
 allowed unfettered access to Britain from the end of this year.

Britain uses the Habitual Residency Test to establish whether EU migrants are eligible for benefits.

To
 qualify for jobseekers’ allowance, employment support allowance, 
pension credit and income support they must demonstrate they have either
 worked here previously or have a good chance of getting a job.

Last
 night the Department for Work and Pensions said it was determined to 
tighten the test to limit migrants’ access to benefits.

But the Commission says this ‘right to reside’ test indirectly discriminates against nationals from other EU states by enforcing a set of conditions that effectively tests their right to state handouts.

The test is being challenged in court by Mr Andor, despite warnings from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith that the existing rules save Britain up to £2billion a year. Mr Duncan Smith pledged last year to toughen up the test to curb ‘benefit tourism’.

A DWP spokesman said: ‘We have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused.

‘But we are also going further by strengthening the Habitual Residence Test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits.

‘Ministers are also working with their counterparts across Europe to address concerns about the abuse of free movement.’
