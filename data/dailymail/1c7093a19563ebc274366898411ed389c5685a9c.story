Are you afraid of arachnids? Then you might just want to look away now. These incredible and somehow deeply unsettling photos of exotic spiders were captured in intricate detail and glorious technicolor by Malaysian photographer JIMMY KONG.

He went in search of eight-legged friends in his native country and his photos reveal them in a way they are rarely seen, with every single bristle on their legs in crystal-sharp focus.

If you look closely enough, you can even see Jimmy's lens reflected in their gleaming eyes.

Jimmy's other photographs include ladybirds, moths and beetles, and he has also captured the gruesome ruthlessness of the natural world as insects devour each other alive. To view more of the collection click here.

Eyes see you! Malaysian photographer Jimmy Kong has captured these incredible photos of spiders in his native country - which are sure to give you the willies

Bright: Some of the spiders are illuminated so brightly it looks as though they have been painted in false colours or are lit from within

Spindly: We are used to seeing arachnids scuttling under the couch as little more than a dark blur, but Jimmy Kong's photos reveal a side to them which we rarely see

Bristles: Although spiders have multiple pairs of eyes, much of their 'vision' comes from sensitive hairs which pick up even the slightest vibration in their environment

Surreal: Many of the species are highly unusual, with translucent skin and pointy protrusions on top of their eyes

Otherworldy: The spiders call to mind the giant evil beasts of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings - but most of them are completely harmless, despite their looks

Hey beautiful: Some of the spiders, captured on a Nikon D90 camera by Jimmy Kong, look a little like giant robots or alien fighting machines

Fluttering: This spider is sitting pretty on a leaf with what, bizarrely, look like false eyelashes. Spiders' hairs are highly sensitive and act as their second sight

Just sitting in my hole: The spiders shot in their natural environment look very much like they've been caught in the headlights - with Mr Kong reflected in their glassy eyes

Camouflage: This species blends in with the spines on a leaf almost perfectly. Even its eyes are practically the same shade of green

Gorgeous: Eight-legged creatures are not always regarded as the most beautiful in the animal kingdom, but they serve a vital function in the natural order

Put your hands in the air: The photographer's skill is evident as his images almost look like they have been posed for by his eight-legged models

Hiding out: 35,000 spider species have been listed worldwide, but only a handful are considered dangerous and 27 are known to have killed humans
