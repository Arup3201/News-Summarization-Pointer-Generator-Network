Wrinkles: Painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, the work portrays Elizabeth I in her sixties, with no attempt to hide the ravages of time

You may not have liked the Duchess of Cambridge’s first official portrait – but at least she got off more lightly than Elizabeth I.

A painting of the Tudor  monarch has gone on display which, rarely, shows her with unflattering wrinkles.

The work portrays Elizabeth in her sixties, resplendent in her regal glory, but with no attempt to hide the ravages of time.

It was painted in the late sixteenth century by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger who was a renowned artist of the Tudor court.

However, it is not clear why he was a little too true to life.

In an early example of royal public relations, a proclamation had by then been issued to control how Elizabeth was seen by her public.

It said ‘unseemly portraits which were to her great offence’ were to be defaced and only those approved by the Queen’s Sergeant Painter were to be produced.

The painting – on show at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC – was described as unique by Thomas Herron, co-curator of the Folger Shakespeare Library exhibition Nobility and Newcomers in Renaissance Ireland.

He said that while many artists of the time chose to make Elizabeth look young, visitors to the court said she had a grace and elegance in age that actually suited her.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s portrait was unveiled last month, but the work by artist Paul Emsley was branded ‘ghastly’ and ‘lifeless’ by some critics.
