Neil Warnock is still aiming to add to his Crystal Palace backroom staff despite bringing in Ronnie Jepson and Kevin Blackwell.

The new Eagles boss is targeting one more addition to complete his Selhurst Park coaching line-up.

Blackwell has arrived to fulfil a watching brief, similar to the role Gerry Francis played under Tony Pulis.

Palace host Newcastle in Capital One Cup action on Wednesday, with Warnock warning his side to expect the visitors to be fired up by continued Tyneside unrest.

United boss Alan Pardew has clung onto his job despite widespread protests from supporters calling for his head during Saturday's 2-2 home Premier League draw with Hull.

Warnock now expects Newcastle to put in a strong showing in south London as his friend Pardew fights for his future.

'It will mean a lot to Alan, they are fighting on all fronts up there,' Warnock told talkSPORT.

Keen to hand fringe players the opportunity to impress against Newcastle, Warnock will resist wholesale changes after Sunday's 3-2 league victory at Everton.

The former Sheffield United boss is hoping for summer recruit Brede Hangeland to take his chance to shine as he continues to settle following his Fulham switch.

Former Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen remains a part of Warnock's coaching set up

The former Norway captain questioned sacked Fulham boss Felix Magath's methods this week, but Warnock hailed Hangeland as the model professional.

'I've got to see some players play, so we've got to give people chances,' said Warnock.

'Brede's such a gentleman: when he arrived at the club he said to me "gaffer you won't have any problems from me, I'll work hard and I'm here for you".

'He's such a gentleman like I say and he's a real pro.

'So I'm looking forward to seeing him play on Wednesday.'

New backroom additions Jepson and Blackwell both played under Warnock at Huddersfield, with the new Eagles manager turning to trusted lieutenants in his second south London stint.

Despite Warnock's coaching reorganisation Keith Millen is still expected to remain at the club.

The former Bristol City boss enjoyed his second stint as Palace caretaker manager after Pulis' exit on the eve of the new season.

Both Warnock and co-chairman Steve Parish are keen to keep him in Palace's set-up.
