Roland Holman, 55, insisted he smothered his 76-year-old mother Myrna (above) in her bed because she 'asked him to end it'

A man who suffocated his cancer-stricken mother with a pillow dialled 999 shortly afterwards and sobbed: 'My mum has had cancer and I've just stopped everything and I've killed her. Can you please come round and put me away?'

Roland Holman, 55, insisted he smothered his 76-year-old mother Myrna in her bed because she 'asked him to end it'.

Today, Holman, of Plaistow, east London, was jailed for 18 months, having earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Mrs Holman was suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer and had been given 12 weeks to live.

Her son, a former shop steward, was alone with her at her home, also in Plaistow, on June 1 last year.

At 5.09pm, Holman made the 999 call, adding: 'She [his mother] asked me to put an end to it and I did.

'I killed my mum, I suffocated her, she wanted me to do it.'

When police arrived at the house, they found Holman in tears, sitting beside his mother's lifeless body clutching her 'pale white hand' under the covers.

He later said to police: 'She told me she didn't want to be here anymore. I did it. I did it.Â 

'I don't drink, I don't smoke - I just killed my mum. My family took turns looking after her, it was my turn - she was very ill.

'She wanted to go to the toilet and I lifted her to the commode but it was too late.

'There was blood and mess all over the place. She looked at me and asked me to do it for her. I lifted her back onto the bed and put the pillow over her. She didn't even struggle.

'I loved her, I would have done anything for her.'

Speaking at the Old Bailey, Judge
 Richard Marks said: 'It is clear that at the time of her death, your 
mother was gravely ill and had a short time left to live.

'You
 and other members of the family were taking it in turns looking after 
her and I have no doubt that seeing the rapid deterioration of her 
condition along with her pain and distress must have been deeply 
upsetting for you all.

'It is against that background and to
 put an end to her suffering that you brought an end to her life by 
suffocating her with a pillow.

'I'm prepared to accept that you believed that is what she wanted when you acted as you did.

Speaking after the hearing, Roland Holman's brother, David (pictured above, today), said: 'It's disgusting that someone can make a 999 call saying they have just killed their mother and get away with it'

'One consequence of what you did is she was not able to die surrounded by her family by whom she was clearly greatly loved and none of them had the opportunity of saying goodbye to her - all of that she no doubt would have wanted.

'There is no doubt many people believe that euthanasia should be legalised but that is not the position and what you did was unlawful and wrong.

'The matter is too serious for any outcome other than one of an immediate custodial sentence.'

Holman was charged with his mother's murder on June 2 last year and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Psychiatrists accept that he was suffering from a depressive illness which would have diminished his responsibility at the time of the incident.

Prosecutor Max Hill QC said: 'It was the defendant's understanding that his mother wanted him to relieve her from suffering and he felt overwhelmed and helpless trying to care for her.

'There's no evidence that the deceased asked anyone to end her life so we cannot accept there is any likelihood she made such a request to the defendant.

James Scoby QC defending, said: 'Roland Holman above anybody understands the sanctity of life.

'He had been suffering from depression for about three years before the incident and was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of this desperate act.

'He expects the key to be thrown away. Seeing your mother die in front of your eyes is crushing and that is why he acted on impulse the way he did.

'He accepts he has denied her family the chance for them to say goodbye properly.'

Holman, also of Plaistow, has already served around seven and a half months and is due to be released within a few weeks.

Speaking after the hearing, his brother, David Holman, said: 'It's disgusting that someone can make a 999 call saying they have just killed their mother and get away with it.

'He is a good guy and did it only to help my mum but that judge has given him a pat on the back and let him go free.

'I never had the chance to sit with mum and hold her hand.

'I said to him that morning, "If you can't cope, I won't go".

'Why did he have to stick a pillow over her head?'

Judge Marks said he hoped that in time David 'feels able to forgive his brother'.
