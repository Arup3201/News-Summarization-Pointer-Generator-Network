Paramedics thought he had been run over at first because they found him lying on the ground between two cars, around 5.20 this morning.

His condition in hospital today was described as 'very serious.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the hospitalisation of a British national in Ibiza on July 12.  We are providing consular assistance.'

Tragic: Tourist Janine Mallett, 31, from Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesborough was found dead in the same Ibiza resort last Saturday

Tourist Janine Mallett, 31, from Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesborough was found dead in the same Ibiza resort last Saturday.

It emerged today that she drowned during a late night swim in the sea after taking a cocktail of illegal drugs.

The Diario de Ibiza website reports 
that Mallett, from Stockton-on-Tees, was staying with friends in a 
holiday apartment in San Antonio.

She is believed to have gone into the sea for a swim at around 4am. She was found seven hours later at 11am.

For reasons currently unknown, Mallet became separated from the group and ended up on the beach alone.

Previous
reports revealed that Mrs Mallett lived with electrician husband Iain, 
30, and her two children - a three-year-old boy and six-year-old girl.

Her
mother, Colleen Hadfield, 62, said: ‘She was the most lovely person. 
She was beautiful. We are just waiting to see when we can bring her 
home.’

Her body was discovered on Saturday morning just before 11am off S’Arenal beach, the main beach of party resort San Antonio.

A source said: ‘Janine was with a 
female friend. They went out and got separated from each other and the 
friend went back to the hotel alone just before 1am on Saturday morning 
with no idea where Janine was.

‘They
hadn’t spoken about going swimming as far as I know so it’s a mystery 
as to how Janine’s body came to be in the sea. The friend is obviously 
devastated.’

A van carrying British tourists has overturned on a Croatian road, injuring 11 people.

Doctors say the injured have been taken to hospital but that the injuries are not life-threatening.

They include ten British tourists and the Croat driver.

It was not immediately clear what caused the crash early today.

The van was travelling on a highway connecting Croatia's Adriatic coast with the capital, Zagreb.

A spokesman for
the Foreign Office said ‘We can confirm the death of a British national
in Ibiza. We are offering consular assistance to the family.’

Irishman Brian Farrelly, 20, drowned in the swimming pool at Hotel Brisa, a two-star hotel which describes itself as a place with a 'youthful atmosphere', in July 2008.

Farrelly, from Drimnagh in Dublin, drowned after jumping into the pool at his hotel in the party resort of San Antonio, in Ibiza.

Before leaving for Ibiza, he wrote on his Bebe homepage: 'Goin to Ibiza on the 5th July for two weeks... Brisa Hotel, San Antonio, gonna be animal.'

Farrelly was pulled out of the pool by police and paramedics after hotel guests raised the alarm. However, he was pronounced dead at the scene after failing to respond to attempts to revive him.

The day before Mr Farrelly's death, he had checked into the 122-room Hotel Brisa along with a couple of his friends in San Antonio.
