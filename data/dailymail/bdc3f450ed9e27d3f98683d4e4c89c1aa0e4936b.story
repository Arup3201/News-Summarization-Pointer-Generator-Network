In one panoramic, you can witness two of the main reasons Manchester United versus Liverpool remains the fiercest rivalry in England.

Observing Old Trafford from the west, Salford Quays is to your left, and the Sir Alex Ferguson stand to your right. It takes 15 minutes to walk from one to the other. 

The Manchester Ship Canal (which runs through the Quays) and United’s most successful manager have done most to trigger and accentuate the sharp edge between these clubs.

In the 1800s Liverpool thrived as a port to goods around the globe, while the textile boom saw Manchester evolve hugely.

But Manchester’s business community grew frustrated at the charges placed by Liverpool’s docks – so the canal was constructed to bypass those gatekeepers and bring transportation boats inland.

Jobs were lost in Liverpool and a feud between cities begun. Football has always been a lens through which such differences could be tribally exhibited.

Both teams experienced success after the Second World War. United landed the first European Cup for an English side in 1968, but Liverpool raised that continental triumph with four of their own as they dominated English football in the 1970s and 80s.

When Ferguson came south of the border, United trailed Liverpool 16 titles to seven; the Liver bird was crowing.

United had held their own in one-off matches against Liverpool throughout the Merseysiders’ supremacy – but any fleeting moments of exultation shrunk with each bit of lost silverware. Liverpool bossed it.

Ferguson changed all that. Two more titles went Liverpool’s way before the great Scot finally got the top-flight crown back to Old Trafford in 1993.

The pursuit had started and the rivalry increased. As United edged closer to that total hanging like a gilded carrot, it meant these two clubs in the North West separated by 30 miles moved clear at the top of English football history.

In that rarefied air, it became an intense duel throughout the 90s and 2000s. Liverpool supporters gloated about their overall advantage, but United fans revelled as the gap closed. Like a barge slicing through the landscape, they eased towards 18 and drew alongside in 2009.

In 2011, United went ahead and with Ferguson’s final title made it 20, as fans have dedicated in song. Liverpool still hold the upperhand on European Cups, 5-3, and do not fail to remind their adversaries.

At times the rivalry has frothed into the grotesque. United fans singing about Hillsborough, Liverpool about Munich and other instances beside. Then there is softer bravado over which city has the better music, comedy and fashion.

But the strongest theme is football success, as Ferguson’s eminent quote pertains. In September 2002, amid his team’s struggles and Arsenal’s superiority, he showed the undercurrent that had driven him all along.

Responding to Alan Hansen’s suggestion he was going through his greatest challenge, Ferguson said: ‘My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their f****** perch… And you can print that.’
