Cesc Fabregas still can't believe he's wearing the blue of Chelsea, but has already fitted into the side seamlessly after a man of the match performance against Burnley.

The midfielder assisted all three goals as Jose Mourinho's side swept past the Clarets during a display full of fluency to lay down a marker to the rest of the Premier League.

Fabregas was at the heart of everything for the Blues at Turf Moor and paid homage to his new team-mates for the ease in which he's slotted in.

Captain John Terry revealed that they were fully expecting a night packed full of high intensity.

'We knew it was going to be difficult. Cesc was probably pick of the bunch and we've seen it out in the second half,' he said.

'The manager has made good signings and Costa has started well. We're hoping to do win the league - that's the aim this year.

'You always want to do well. We have a talented young team. So far, so good.

Fabregas, Costa and Andre Schurrle in particular were the trio to dazzle in east Lancashire as Chelsea showcased the different way they plan to go about winning games this season, especially away from Stamford Bridge.

'He [Mourinho] wants us to play from the back, get the ball and move it,' Terry added. 'We dropped too many points away from home last year. We had plenty of possession.'
