Once dubbed the ‘worst hotel in Britain’, it became renowned for being infested with cockroaches - and even made Fawlty Towers look like a reasonable place to stay.

Now the owner has been officially told that he cannot run it after 30 years at the helm, after shocked hotel inspectors discovered a mouse infestation, raw sewage and flies.

Stephen Gethin, 62, was deemed unfit to continue running the Happyvale Hotel in Mornington Crescent, north London - a five-storey townhouse which overlooks a park.

'Worst hotel in Britain': Stephen Gethin, 62, who has owned the Happyvale Hotel in Mornington Crescent, north London, for three decades, has been officially deemed unfit to run the business

Horrifying conditions: Shocked hotel inspectors discovered a mouse infestation, raw sewage and flies in the five-storey townhouse overlooking a park, which acts as a hostel for homeless and vulnerable people

Squalid room: Gethin earned up to £130,000 a year in payments from the Government for running the hotel, which was opened more than 80 years ago by his mother as a bed and breakfast for labourers

Gethin earned up to £130,000 a year in
 payments from the Government for running the hotel, which was opened 
more than 80 years ago by his mother as a bed and breakfast for 
labourers.

He was found 
guilty of 15 health and safety offences committed last year and issued 
with a £20,000 penalty last week at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court, 
reported the London Evening Standard.

It
 comes two years after Gethin admitted 13 different charges which ranged
 from failing to provide fire escapes between floors to problems with 
drains and allowing rooms to become overcrowded.

A
 Camden Council investigation which saw him hauled into court in 2012 
found Happyvale was infested with cockroaches, and also discovered 
insects and mice droppings in the property.

Officials also found cockroaches in plugholes and even next to a newborn baby and its food at the hotel, which acts as a hostel for homeless and vulnerable people.

At last week’s hearing, District Judge Newton said Gethin ‘exhibited a callous disregard for the safety and welfare of vulnerable residents [and] a wilful refusal to comply with statutory obligations.

The judge added there were ‘regular contraventions of legislation’, he ‘had failed to respond to advice from the council’, and ‘had exhibited a dismissive attitude towards the local authority’.

Councillor Julian Fulbrook, Camden Council’s cabinet member for housing, told the Standard after the case: ‘It should be renamed the Unhappy Vale Hotel - it’s really quite grim.’

He added: ‘It’s a pretty desperate situation. I think it’s very possibly the worst hotel in Britain.’
