Darren Anderton believes Jack Wilshere is destined to become a world-class star rather than England's next 'sicknote'.

With the retirement of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, Wilshere now has a chance to nail down a place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI - providing he stays fit.

Wilshere was hailed as England's next big thing when he won his first cap aged 18, but injury has since limited his career - just as it did to Anderton, who picked up the unwanted nickname of 'sicknote' following a series of lay-offs.

Anderton thinks pundits like Jamie Redknapp, Paul Scholes and Robbie Savage have been too quick to criticise Wilshere for not yet fulfilling his potential.

The former Tottenham and England midfielder, speaking on behalf of official England team sponsor Vauxhall, is convinced Wilshere has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world.

'If someone like Jack Wilshere can steer clear of injury for six months, he will become a world-class player,' said Anderton, whose international career was restricted to just 30 appearances.

'I understand what Scholesy was saying. Yes, he hasn't gone forward from the player that burst on to the scene, but some of that is down to injury.

'It takes time to get your match sharpness back.

'I have been through that. When you come back people want to see that same player straight away, but it's tough. Players just don't get time.'

Anderton feels Wilshere should look to his Arsenal team-mate Aaron Ramsey for inspiration.

Ramsey broke his leg in horrific fashion against Stoke in 2010, but he has since become one of the best midfielders in the Barclays Premier League.

'Ramsey was out for a while with an injury, he came back, he didn't play well for six months and the Arsenal fans were on his back, but look at him now,' Anderton said.

'The same thing can happen with Jack. He is a similar player - if not better in terms of quality.'
