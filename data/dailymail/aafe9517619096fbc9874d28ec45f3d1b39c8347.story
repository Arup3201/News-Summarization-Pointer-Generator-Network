The Earl of Cardigan's mansion has been bought for nearly £12 million after a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle by the Old Etonian aristocrat to prevent the sale of the home on the estate that has been in his family for 900 years.

The new owner of Tottenham House is understood to be Conservative Party donor and multi-millionaire property developer Jamie Ritblat.

Lord Cardigan, who once said he was 'put on this earth to take care of Savernake and I will never let it go', had fought to keep the 100-room property in his family but was forced to admit defeat earlier this year after an Appeal Court ruling.

The 61-year-old Earl had challenged a decision by the trustees of the Savernake estate to sell the dilapidated house and 800 acres near Marlborough, Wiltshire but lost the case.

Tottenham House, which is 200 years old, has been empty since it was used as a prep school in the 1990s

One of the trustees, John Moore, said last night: 'Tottenham House has now been sold. The sale contract is complete.'

Mr Moore declined to name the purchaser but Mr Ritblat was reported earlier this year to be negotiating to buy the estate. 

Mr Ritblat donated £50,000 to the Tories two days before the last general election via his property empire. One of his companies, Delancey, owns the former athletes' village at the 2012 Olympic Park in London.

Tottenham House, which is 200 years old, has been empty since it was used as a prep school and then leased to a charity until 2004. Lord Cardigan and his American wife Joanne live in a lodge on the estate with their younger daughter, Lady Sophie.

At one stage he was claiming £71 per week jobseeker's allowance and training to be a lorry driver while the court case rumbled on.

He had been in dispute with the trustees since returning from the US in 2011 to discover they had sold off family portraits to pay outstanding bills.

He has also been involved in a legal battle with his estranged daughter, the singer Bo Bruce, who reached the final of the BBC1 talent show The Voice in 2012.

Ms Bruce, whose real name is Lady Catherine Brudenell-Bruce, is the daughter of the earl and his first wife, Rosamond, Countess of Cardigan, who died of cancer two years ago.

The Savernake estate was given to Lord Cardigan's ancestors by William the Conqueror and was once the site of Wolf Hall, the home of Henry VIII's third wife Jane Seymour that provided the title for Hilary Mantel's award–winning novel.

Lord Cardigan is a descendant of the 7th Earl, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War.

Construction work at Tottenham House has already started and the mansion is expected to be converted into luxury flats.

Proceeds from the sale will be shared between the earl and his estranged son, Viscount Savernake, 30.

Neither Mr Ritblat nor the Earl of Cardigan was available for comment.

 An earlier version of this article may have suggested the whole estate was being sold. We would like to make clear that only Tottenham House and its surrounding lands are being sold. The rest of the 4,500-acre Savernake estate in Wiltshire remains under the control of Lord Cardigan’s family trust.
