A key component of anti-ageing creams is next to useless, research suggests.

Some moisturisers use fatty shells called liposomes to ferry wrinkle-busting compounds under the skin, where they can fight the ageing process.

But a study carried out by Danish researchers, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, found that rather than passing through the skin the liposomes break into pieces almost as soon as they make contact.

New research suggests a key component of anti-ageing creams does not work

Professor Luis Bagatolli, of the University of Southern Denmark, said: ‘The skin’s task is to block extraneous substances, which is why it will generally reject anything that tries to penetrate it.

‘So it is no easy task for the beauty industry to find methods of transporting rejuvenating and moisturising substances deep into the skin.

‘We have now shown that liposomes cannot do the job, despite some rather persistent advertising claims.’

The University’s Centre for Miomembrance 
Physics and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology carried out
 new tests of the abilities of liposomes.

Scientists say liposomes - an ingredient in anti-wrinkle creams - are unable to get into skin and break on the surface

Using a method called RICS - Raster 
Imaging Correlation Spectroscopy - they monitored what happens to 
liposomes as they enter the skin by marking them with fluorescent 
colour.

If, under the RICS system, the colours
 are seen to show ‘concerted’ movement as the liposomes contact the 
skin, then it means the liposomes remain intact as they penetrate it.

But, no such movement happened, which,
 according to the researchers, proves that liposomes do not remain 
intact and so do not penetrate the skin as beauty firms claim.

Professor Bagatolli added that liposomes may still work, but not in the way manufacturers believe.
