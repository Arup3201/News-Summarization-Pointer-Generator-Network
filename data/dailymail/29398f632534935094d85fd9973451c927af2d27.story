Taliban suicide bombers assaulted a joint U.S.-Afghan air base in the eastern Afghanistan city Jalalabad early Sunday.

The bombers detonated explosives at the base’s gate and sparked a gun-battle that lasted at least two hours with American helicopters firing down at militants before the attackers were defeated.

A Taliban spokesman confirmed the militant group had launched the 6am assault.

Police said 12 bodies were found near the gate of the airfield, Reuters reports.

There were no NATO casualties in the attack, officials told the BBC. According to that report seven suicide attackers targeted the base.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told the Associated Press that the attackers first exploded a car bomb at the entrance of Jalalabad Airfield then stormed into the base.

The attackers also used rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and small arms fire, according to Agence France-Presse.

A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, General Mohammad Zahir Azimi, said none of the militants were able to enter.

The NATO military coalition also described it as a failed attack.

‘We can confirm insurgents, including multiple suicide bombers, attacked Jalalabad Airfield this morning. None of the attackers succeeded in breaching the perimeter,’ Lieutenant. Colonel Hagen Messer, a spokesman for the international military coalition, said in an email to the AP.

He said that the fighting had ended by mid-morning and that reports showed one member of the Afghan security forces was killed.

Several foreign troops were wounded, but Messer did not give any numbers or details.

The December 2 attack follows a Taliban suicide bombing that killed 23 people at a Shiite Muslim procession near Pakistan’s capital Islamabad on November 21.

NATO, which currently has some 130,000 troops in Afghanistan, is gradually handing security over to Afghan forces ahead of the departure of most combat troops in 2014.
