Victim: Margaret Anderson is a mother of two young daughters who has worked as a park ranger for four years

Authorities are scouring Mount Rainier National Park for a cold-blooded killer who gunned down a U.S. Forest Service Ranger and then fired at officers who were coming to help her.

Officials closed the park after the shooting yesterday, and asked people to stay out of the area while they search for a man carrying a long rifle.

He is also the prime suspect in the shooting of four people at New Year's Eve party hours earlier in the south of Seattle - which left two people critically injured.

The female ranger, Margaret Anderson, 34, a married mother of two young girls, was shot as she stopped the suspect's car.

A 'strong person of interest' has been identified as Benjamin Colton Barnes, 24, an Iraq war veteran who is believed to have strong wilderness survival skills and is heavily armed.

Pierce County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ed Troyer said authorities recovered Barnes' vehicle, which had weapons and body armour inside.

Authorities believed the gunman was still in the woods with an assault rifle. They asked people to stay away from the park, and for those already there to leave.

Mr Troyer said there were about 100 people hunkered down in lodges and cabins on the mountain.  They were told to stay put because they could be in the line of fire.

Armoured vehicles were being brought in to ferry them safely out of the park early this morning around 4am.

Crews had initially planned to keep everyone in a basement with guards. But Mr Troyer said it was determined to be 'better to do it [evacuate] under the cover of darkness than daylight'.

Mr Troyer said authorities were following tracks in the snow they believe are from the gunman, and crews planned to bring an airplane through the area with heat-seeking capabilities. He added: 'We believe we have a good track on him, but he's way ahead of us'.

The officer said Barnes was being followed in the snow but he was making it hard for crews by climbing in and out of streams to cover his tracks. 'We do have a very hot and dangerous situation,' he added.

Wanted: Benjamin Colton Barnes is believed to have gunned down a U.S. Forest Service ranger after shooting four people at a New Year's Eve house party

'Strong person of interest': Benjamin Colton Barnes, who cops say has a 
military background and strong wilderness survival skills, is also a 
suspect in an earlier shooting incident at a New Year's Eve party

A parks spokesman said Barnes is an Iraq war veteran. The mother of Barnes' child had alleged that he suffered from post-traumatic stress following his deployments.

Barnes was involved in a custody dispute in Tacoma in July 2011, during which the toddler's mother sought a temporary restraining order against him.

'We do have a very hot and dangerous situation.'

In an affidavit, the woman wrote that Barnes was suicidal and possibly suffered from PTSD after deploying to Iraq in 2007-2008.

She said he was easily irritated, angry and depressed and kept weapons in the house.

Police said that Barnes is also a
suspect in an early-morning shooting at a New Year's house party in 
Skyway, Washington, south of Seattle that left four people in their 20s injured, two 
critically. It is believed to have began in an argument over a gun.

Police have been in contact with Barnes' family, trying to have them coax him to 'come to the police and tell his side of the story'.

Dinh Jackson, from Olympia, 
Washington, who went to the mountain to sled with family and friends, 
told The Associated Press that officials ordered people to hurry into a 
lodge after the shooting.

Jackson said officials had everyone 
get on their knees and place hands behind their heads as they went 
through the building, looking at faces to make sure the gunman was not 
among them.

Ms Jackson said: 'That was scary for the kids.'

The park would remain closed today, 
officials announced last night. Jason Simpson, 29, of Kent, said his 
parents were still trapped at the visitor's centre after travelling to 
the mountain for a day hike.

His parents were able to make a call explaining their situation, and Mr Simpson drove to the park entrance to wait.

Mr Simpson said: 'It's very distressing'.

At around 10:20am Sunday, another park service employee had tried to stop a man in his vehicle.

When he didn't stop, Anderson set up a road block with her vehicle in the middle of the road, said park spokeswoman Lee Taylor.

The man pulled up to Anderson about 11am, jumped out, and fired before running off, she said.

According to The News Tribune the incident occurred near the Longmire Ranger Station, in the southwest corner of the park.

Mr Troyer said that when authorities arrived they were also shot at, but no one else was hit. 

About
150 officers were on the mountain, but they had not made contact with 
the gunman and did not know where he was, Troyer said.

Responders were only able to reach Mrs Anderson, who had radioed for help, around 12:45pm.

Park superintendent Randy King said that Anderson is a mother of two young daughters who has served as a park ranger for about four years.

He added that her husband also was working as a ranger elsewhere in the park at the time of the shooting.

Adam Norton, a neighbor of Anderson's in the small town of Eatonville, Washington, said the ranger's family moved in about a year ago.

He said they were not around much, but when they were Norton would see Anderson outside with her girls. 'They just seemed like the perfect family,' he said.

The town of about 3,000 residents, which is a logging community overlooking Mount Rainier, is very close knit, he said.

'It's really sad right now,' Norton said. 'We take care of each other.'

Lockdown: Authorities are asking people to stay away from the park, and for those already inside the park to leave. Armed officers were stopping and questioning drivers as they departed.

It has been legal for people to take loaded firearms into Mount Rainier since 2010, when a controversial federal law went into effect that made possession of firearms in national parks subject to state gun laws.

The shooting occurred on an unseasonably sunny and mild day.

The park, which offers miles of wooded trails and spectacular vistas from which to see 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, draws between 1.5million and 2million visitors each year.

The Longmire station served as headquarters when the national park was established in 1899.

Park headquarters have moved but the site still contains a museum, a hotel, restaurant and gift shop, which are open year-round.

Authorities believe the gunman is still in the woods with some type of long assault rifle and possibly other weapons.

Park spokesman Kevin Bacher told Reuters that local law enforcement and the FBI were assisting in the manhunt.

In a statement to the media, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said: 'I am deeply saddened by the tragic, horrific and cowardly murder today at Mount Rainier National Park. 

'The Department of the Interior and the National Park Service will do everything possible to bring the perpetrator of this crime to justice and to ensure the safety of park visitors and other park rangers.'

He added: 'This tragedy serves as a reminder of the risks undertaken by the men and women of the National Park Service and law enforcement officers across the Department every day, and we thank them for their service. My thoughts and prayers are with Margaret's family in this difficult time.'
