Deon E. Warren, 19, is charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting dead a father of two

Police in Maryland have arrested a 19-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of a father of two who tried to break up a fight to protect his teenage son.

Deon E. Warren, of Upper Marlboro, was arrested late Wednesday night at a motel in Anne Arundel County.

He's charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 39-year-old Mitchell White, who was trying to break up a fight on Tuesday at around 5:35 p.m. when he was shot.

White tried to protect his 16-year-old son and break up the altercation between him and another man at the parking lot at the Belair Swim and Racquet Club near Bowie High School.

There were dozens of people there, and they all scattered when a shot was fired.

White was struck and died at the scene.

He had a 16-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter and was set to marry his fiancée, Tanya, in the Bahamas next spring, according to WTTV reported.

His heartbroken family found out about White's death via Twitter, according to the station. 

'I don't understand why this would happen,' the victim's mother, Netty Edwards, told WTTV.

'Why this man would take my son's life like that. It's just terrible.'

Investigators working the case quickly identified Warren as the suspect aided by the series of of tattoos he has covering his face, including a black crescent moon and star — among other easily recognizable marks.

'All them tattoos, that's kind of crazy,' V. Watkins, who lives across the street from Warren, told WJLA.

'I wouldn't have myself marked up like that, it's a dead giveaway.' 

Court records show that Warren was cited for marijuana possession in December 2013 and May 2014, according to WJLA. 

Warren, who is being held without bond, also has a juvenile rap sheet but those records are kept sealed, the station added.
