The 3D mapping gives curious minds all over the world a chance to explore Australia's World Heritage Site

This project is part of a collaboration with Australian researchers Catlin Seaview Survey

The photos will also be used to document the damages of the world's largest coral reef caused by cyclones or global warming

The underwater 3D images on Google Maps, made accessible as of Friday, is part of a collaboration with Australian researchers Catlin Seaview Survey. 

'They can go jump in the water, go on a virtual dive and see how different the reef is along the 2300 kilometres,' Catlin Seaview Survey executive director Richard Vevers told the ABC.

A specially-designed camera was used to gather thousands of photos of the heritage-listed reef in Queensland, theABC reports.

'It allows us to take full 360 [degree] images every three seconds as we're travelling along reef environments,' Mr Vevers said.

The photos will also be used to document the damages of the world's largest coral reef caused by cyclones or global warming.

The Great Barrier Reef covers 1,429 miles and is so large it can be seen from outer space. 

Marine
 creatures include 600 types of soft and hard corals, more than 100 
species of jellyfish, 3000 varieties of molluscs, 500 species of worms, 
1625 types of fish, 133 varieties of sharks and rays, and more than 30 
species of whales and dolphins.

It extends south from the northern tip of Queensland in north-eastern Australia to just north of Bundaberg.

The reef is an at risk World Heritage listed site that UNESCO believes could become an 'in danger' later this year.
