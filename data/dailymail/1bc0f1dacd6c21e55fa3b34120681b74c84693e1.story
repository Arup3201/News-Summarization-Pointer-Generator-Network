The bond between a handler and their K-9 can only be built over time.

It's a closeness that becomes intrinsic, with the dedication of the dog built not on money or benefit, but love.

So having to say goodbye is always going to be heartbreaking.

Such was the sad situation faced by the 802nd Security Forces Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas recently, when a beloved member of their unit, MWD Daysi, had to be euthanized for an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor.

Heartbroken: Senior Airman Chelsea LaFever says goodbye to MWD Daysi, who had to be euthanized at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas due to an aggressive form of cancer

Emotional: Sgt. Paul Olmos, the military working dog handler assigned MWD Daysi since last year, plays with his partner one last time before she was euthanized on February 27, 2015

Daysi was certified to join the narcotics detection team in January 2014, the Air Education and Training Command released this week.

She had never had a handler before, and her partner with Sgt. Paul Olmos, had never had his own dog.

'Daysi and Olmos were an ideal team pairing,' said Tech. Sgt. Kevin Nelson, 802nd SFS kennel master. 

'Their relationship is immense because this was their first experience as a MWD team.'

Olmos would spend all of his free time with his charge.

'I'm single and I don't have immediate family here, so I'd come on the weekends just to visit her and take her on runs,' Olmos said. 

'I couldn't even tell you how much time we've spent together.'

Together they participated in the Texas Toughest Dog competition.

However in January this year, trainers noticed something was wrong with Daysi's left leg.

Sick: Daysi had an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor and could not be operated on

An initial check-up didn't show anything abnormal.

However a follow-up evaluation detected a tumor.

Daysi's certification was subsequently canceled and she was taken in for treatment.

The tumor was found to be pushing on a nerve and causing her pain. 

But due to the location, doctors were unable to operate, which would cause the cancer to spread to the rest of her body.

'The news of Daysi's declining health hit us hard; this sort of news always does,' Tech. Sgt. Kevin Nelson said.

'Euthanasia of MWDs is a last resort and we try to approach every option available before it comes to that,' 

'Most of our dogs get adopted out or continue on with their service in a civilian police department.'

Final goodbye: Military members line up and salute MWD Daysi as she is walked into a veterinary clinic to be put down by her partner, Sgt. Paul Olmos

On February 27, all of those who had worked with MWD Daysi lined up outside the veterinary clinic.

A police procession blared sirens that resonated throughout the base.

The officers then saluted as Daysi was lead into the facility to be put down. 

'These dogs are our brothers and sisters in arms as well,' Nelson added.

While highly-emotional, no one seemed to be more affected than Sgt. Olmos. 

'Through all the training we've done together and the long 12 to14 hour days; it was just me and her,' he said.

'She's my partner.'
