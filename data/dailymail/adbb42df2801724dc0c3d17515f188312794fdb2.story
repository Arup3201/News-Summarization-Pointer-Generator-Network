A five-year-old boy is following in his twin brother's footsteps after undergoing surgery to ‘put the magic back’ into his legs – enabling him to walk.

Jacob Cook wanted to chase after his identical sibling Jordan but was unable even to sit up after being diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was just six-months old. 

The boys were born prematurely at 28 weeks in December 2008 and the differences between them became apparent when Jacob failed to achieve targets expected of babies.

His condition was managed with physiotherapy until his parents raised £65,000 to go to America for an operation which is not routinely available on the NHS.

Now Jacob can walk with the aid of a frame and is finally playing games with his brother.

The boys’ mother, Lucy Fletcher of Summertown, Oxford, said: ‘When they were born, they weighed less than 6lb between them.

‘They were rushed to special care but considering how early they were they were quite healthy for their age.

‘We were in hospital with them for two months and on the day we left they gave both Jacob and Jordan routine brain scans.

‘They found Jacob had two cysts on his brain. We had made it and somehow they had both survived, so it was a huge blow.’

Doctors monitored Jacob's condition and despite initially making good process, his development slowed.

Although his eyes were tracking correctly and he'd learned to roll over like his brother Jordan, he was soon flagging behind.

Further tests revealed Jacob was suffering from cerebral palsy - an incurable condition that causes mobility and breathing difficulties.

Lucy, 26, said: ‘Jacob was around six-months-old and he couldn't sit up. That's when he started missing the milestones.

‘We got the diagnosis that it was cerebral palsy. I was a bit in denial as I wanted to believe everything was fine.

‘When I look back at pictures now, I can see his hands are always tight but as a first-time mum, I didn't know the difference.’

As Jacob and Jordan grew up, Jacob's cognitive abilities matched his brother's yet they were unable to run around and play together.

Doctors managed his condition with regular physiotherapy until an operation became available in the US to help him walk.

The Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure sees surgeons cut the nerves in the spinal cord that are sending the wrong messages to the legs, in turn strengthening Jacob's legs.

His father Scott Cook, 32, said: ‘He's always been cognitively fine so his speech developed normally but he never learned to crawl or walk. He's very behind.

‘Jordan has brought him on more than anyone because he's always got his little playmate and he's always there helping him to do his physio.

‘We had to
 raise £65,000 - £45,000 was for surgery and then we needed money for 
rehab and physiotherapy following the operation.’ 

The family travelled to St Louis in Missouri, US, in June 2013, where Jacob's surgery was successful.

‘The care was brilliant,’ said Lucy. ‘We were looked after really well.

‘Jacob didn't fully understand what would happen but we told him that the doctor would put magic back into his legs to try to make them work.

‘We want him to be aware of what was happening, but we didn't want him to be disappointed if it didn't work.

‘He has asked the question 'why am I not like Jordan?' but I just explain that he was poorly as a baby. We have brought him up to believe he's got to get on with it.’

Since the surgery last year, both Jacob and Jordan have started school, and despite Jacob needing daily physiotherapy, they can now both walk around together as brothers.

‘He's never really been jealous of Jordan, which is nice,’ Lucy added. ‘He's been good at getting Jordan to help him and now he's at school he gets all the girls to get him what he wants too.

‘It's been very busy, and it's hard work, but he's definitely made a lot of progress.

‘He once had no mobility but he's worked really hard at his physio and he never complains and he gets on just fine.’
