In a horrifying echo of the James Bulger abduction, a stranger leads a toddler away from his mother in a busy shopping centre.

The grainy CCTV footage shows a boy of 22 months being approached by an elderly man.

He takes the child’s hand and makes off – only for the mother to turn, as if she had sensed danger. She challenges the stranger, who apologises to her and walks off.

Police
 released the footage of Thursday’s incident to try to track the man 
down and ask him what he was doing.

Yesterday an 80-year-old came 
forward after seeing himself in local media coverage of the incident at 
Derby’s Intu shopping centre.

The
 pensioner – described as confused – told officers he had been trying to
 take the child to another woman he believed was the mother. No further action is being taken against him.

In
 the notorious Bulger abduction of February 1993, two-year-old James was
 murdered by two boys who took him from his mother, Denise Fergus, at a 
shopping centre in Bootle, Liverpool.

The abduction – by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, both aged just ten at the time – was captured on CCTV.

They became the youngest convicted murderers in modern English history.

Although police have said the 80-year-old man was acting with 'good intentions', abduction is still a terrifying issue in the UK.

According
 to the Office for National Statistics, there were 532 cases of child 
abduction reported to police in 2011/12 (excluding Scotland).

That
 figure is a three per cent decrease on the previous data collection 
year and much lower than a high of 1,035 cases in 2004/05.

Cases of parental abduction have double in the past decade, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) say.

In 2003/04 the FCO was involved in 272 cases and in 2012/13 the figure rose to 580.

In
 the Derby CCTV footage, the child’s mother, who has not been 
identified, can be seen wheeling his empty pushchair into a Boots store 
with her son just a few yards behind her.

As she crosses the store’s 
threshold, the man, in flat cap and dark coat, takes the boy by the hand
 and appears to say something to the child before leading him away from 
the store.

As the pair move 
off, the mother realises what has happened and approaches the man, who 
apologises and appears to point further down the shopping arcade.

But he
 then attempts to take the child’s hand for a second time before finally
 walking off.

Derbyshire 
Police said the pensioner was interviewed and released after detectives 
were satisfied he was acting with ‘good intentions’.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Nick Lamb said: ‘We are very grateful to the response 
from the public and to the man who contacted us and was later 
interviewed.

‘The gentleman was acting with good intentions, believing the young boy had become separated from his mother.

The Intu Shopping Centre in Derby, where the incident took place

‘The
 man was a little confused and thought the child’s mother was somebody 
else, and had tried to do a good deed in reuniting them.’

However, the incident has prompted police to issue advice to members of the public 
about what to do if they see a child they believe to be alone.

This
 includes staying still with the child and not leading them away from 
where you have found them; asking them where their parents or guardians 
are and looking around to see if you can spot them; considering asking 
other passers-by if they know where the child’s parents are; and taking 
them to the nearest shop if their parents can’t be found after a few 
minutes.

A spokesman for the
 Intu centre said: ‘We are of course delighted that this matter has been
 resolved and that it was simply a misunderstanding.'
