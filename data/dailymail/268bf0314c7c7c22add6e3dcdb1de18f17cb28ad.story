It was a family affair for Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex today, as the royal couple and their 10-year-old daughter Lady Louise Windsor watched the Commonwealth games in Glasgow.

They were pictured cheering on the England women’s team during the Preliminaries Hockey game between Malaysia on Sunday morning, where England won 5-0.

The game took place at the Glasgow International Hockey Centre and the family watched on intently, glued to their seats as the action took place.

They were seen clapping and cheering 
when England scored, though Sophie and Lady Louise seemed particularly 
animated, whilst Prince Edward looked slightly more subdued.

At other points during the game, Lady Louise rested her arm on her mother’s shoulder.

England last played Malaysia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.

It wasn’t the first Commonwealth outing the sporting-enthusiast family have enjoyed.

Yesterday,
 The Countess and her two children, Louise and James, Viscount Severn 
watched Scotland compete against New Zealand in the Rugby Severns.

After his official engagements, Prince Edward joined his family to watch the rugby game.

Wearing
 matching pink t-shirts, Sophie and Louise, along with six-year-old 
James and the children’s nanny, who also joined them earlier today to 
watch the hockey match, took in the game at the Ibrox Stadium.

On Sunday, as she watched the Hockey game, Sophie dressed down in blue cropped trousers and a white shirt underneath a grey jumper.

Clearly not as warm as in southern parts
 of Great Britain, Sophie compensated for the chilly Scottish weather by
 wrapping a navy blue sweater around her shoulders.

Later in the day, Sophie changed into a smart cream blazer to take in a game at Kelvingrove Bowls
Club.

The match was between Scotland and New Zealand.

The Countess was clearly engrossed in the lawn action, and could barely take her eyes off the game.

During particularly tense moments of the game she was seen pursing her lips or bringing her hands to her mouth in disbelief.
