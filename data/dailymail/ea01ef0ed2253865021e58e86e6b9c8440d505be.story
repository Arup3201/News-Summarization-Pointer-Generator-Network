Painstaking: Jose Galvan, top right, and his daughter Gabriela restore statues of baby Jesus for clients at their stand at a market in Mexico City

Jose Galvan and his daughter Gabriela have been hard at work over the past few days.

At their stand at a market in Mexico City, they have been busy painstakingly restoring these dolls for a very big day.

But they are no ordinary child's plaything, these modest looking figurines are in fact icons of baby Jesus that play an important role in the religious life of their owners.

Catholics in Mexico will today 
celebrate the feast day of the Virgin of the Candelaria by dressing up 
statues of baby Jesus and bringing them to their local church to be 
blessed.

Mr Galvan and his 
daughter have been taking in the doll-like icons, many of them family 
heirlooms, brightening up their rosy cheeks and touching up any chips 
and scratches ahead of the holiday.

The
 Dia de la Candelaria, known to the English-speaking world as Candlemas,
 is celebrated throughout Mexico on February 2, explains About.com's 
Mexico Travel website.

Among
 the devotions to Mary, veneration to her as the Virgin of the 
Candelaria - that is, the Virgin of the Candles - is popular in many 
former Spanish and Portuguese colonies, including the Philippines, Cuba,
 Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, and the Canary Islands.

Throughout Mexico people will dress up figures of baby Jesus and take him to their local church to be blessed.

The dolls used in the celebration, known as 
niños Dios, are typically owned by families in areas of Mexico where 
religious traditions are respected and they play a variety of roles

The
 tradition stems from the belief that February 2 was the day that the 
Virgin Mary first brought her son Jesus to the temple to be blessed, at 
the end of the 40 days following giving birth that a woman is considered
 'unclean' according to Jewish law.

Another, no doubt older, source of the
 festival is astronomical, with the date marking the exact mid-way point
 between the winter solstice - the shortest day of the year - and the 
spring equinox - when night and day are of equal lengths.

Take your pick: Three baby Jesus dolls in differing styles of dress are seen on a market stall in Mexico City

They play a variety of roles: first the niños Dios are placed in the Nativity scene on Christmas eve; on January 6, King's Day, the dolls are brought presents from the Three Kings; and on February 2 they are presented at Church.

But in a reflection of Mexico's fusion of Catholic religions with older, pagan beliefs, the Jesus icons are frequently clothed in pre-Columbian dress.

After the presentation, the festival continues with parades and, in some areas, bull fights.

Families
 celebrate the day by getting together with friends to eat tamales, 
which are steamed buns made with cornmeal dough and wrapped in either 
corn husks or banana leaves.
