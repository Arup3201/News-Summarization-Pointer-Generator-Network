Veteran cricketer Cecil Wright is still racing in to bowl at the age of 79, after bagging an amazing 7,000 wickets in an illustrious 65-year career.

Fast bowler Cecil Wright may be one of the oldest players in Britain but he is refusing to be sent back to the pavilion by old age, proved by the six wickets he grabbed for his club side just last week.

Known as 'Cec' to his friends, he moved to Oldham in Greater Manchester in the 1950s to play league cricket and also represented Jamaica, but he still remains the scourge of batsmen.

Still racing in: Cecil Wright, who turns 80 in December, remains the scourge of batsmen, taking 7,000 wickets in 65 years

Icons: Cec, as he is known to his friends, played alongside greats of the game including legend Viv Richards

In his last four games for his local league side he has taken 15 wickets, including six in one game, and said that even though his opening bowl is not as fast as it once was he is still a force to be reckoned with on the pitch.

In his heyday he played alongside legends of the game including West Indies cricket legends Sir Viv Richards, Sir Frank Worrell, Sir Garfield Sobers and Joel Garner plus England stalwart Denis Compton.

And he said that despite being old enough to be most of his opponents' grandfather he can still teach them a thing or two about the game.

Cecil who has a son and two grandchildren and who lives in Royton, near Oldham, said: 'I've been playing since I was a young boy and I was a professional for over 50 years so I don't want to finish yet.

'I've been lucky with injuries and I have always kept fit so I will keep playing.

'Some of the lads I play against might not expect much from an opponent who is approaching 80 but I'm still good enough to get anyone out, even if my fast bowl is a bit of a medium bowl nowadays.'

Still got it: More than 50 years later Mr Wright celebrates taking another wicket this season

He is set to play up to 40 games this season including matches in the Saddleworth and District Cricket League in Oldham, Greater Manchester, for his side Uppermill.

Last week 'Cec' took six wickets in a match against Friarmere, bowling 10 overs in helping Uppermill's second XI to a 16-run win. Instead of putting his feet up he then played again the next day, this time taking three wickets.

Cec first arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1959 after signing as the Crompton professional in the Central Lancashire League.

He had already made a First Class appearance for Jamaica.

After three summers playing in the Lancashire leagues he decided to stay in the UK.

During one spell he took 538 wickets in five seasons, averaging one every 27 balls in the days of the eight-ball over.

Action man: Cecil Wright is believed to be one of the oldest cricketers in Britain, and is sure to be the most successful of that age

Celebrated Cecil: The 79 year old with his trophies and awards, he was even painted for a portrait by artist Mark Whyatt, given to him when he retired

He met Enid, who he has now been married to for 50 years. As well as playing cricket he also worked in a cotton mill, before starting work for Mars in a distribution warehouse in Manchester for 29 years.

He said the secret of his long playing career is his love of Lancashire food including hot pot and pie and peas as well as his favourite fruit and vegetables from the West Indies including yams, sweet potatoes and green bananas.

He has even taken up Crown Green Bowls and has had to get used to bowling underarm and keeps fit by playing cricket with his two young grandchildren.

Winner: Cecil part of a championship winning squad in 1981, where his bowling drove the side on to victory

More trophies: Cec in the Lancashire over 50s team in the 1990s, after yet another win

He said: 'To be honest I eat anything that's going but I don't drink much, just the odd beer. And I keep fit, although these days I use my age as an excuse to miss training.

'I find keeping active helps to ease aches and pains. I don't like to sit still and watch TV, I would rather have a walk or potter about in the garage.

'If I have a bruised finger or a sore leg I don't worry about it, I just keep going and don't complain.

'I've thought about retiring but I can't. I've no idea how many games I have played now in my career - probably about two million.

'As long as I feel okay and I'm selected I'll continue to turn out.'

A spokesman for the 'cricket bible' Wisden said although some amateur cricketers had played into their late 80s Cec's effort was 'pretty good going'.
