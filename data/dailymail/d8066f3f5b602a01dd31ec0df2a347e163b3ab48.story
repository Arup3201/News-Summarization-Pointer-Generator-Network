A new study of Facebook trends shows that a reliance on a small but highly active group of users may prove costly for the company as it prepares to go public.

Pew Research Center reports that only 20-30 per cent of Facebook's 843 million users are deemed 'power users', the most active on the social networking site.

This figure comes as Facebook begins the process of trying to convince investors that their users' brand loyalty will amount to large financial gains, and is expecting a $100billion evaluation when initial public offering is set.

The vast majority of activity on Facebook comes from a minority of its users who are much more dedicated than others

The research collected by Pew suggests that its users are not suffering from 'Facebook fatigue', but rather the opposite: the emotional connection that users have with the network encourage them to keep coming back to the site.

This finding is strategically important for the company this week as they finally started the process of becoming a publicly traded company.

Even though users do seem to be happy on the site, there is undoubtedly a constant fear that their biggest base may leave.

If those 'power users' were to leave the leading social network, that could pose major problems for the company because of the vast amount of activity that would flee with them.

Power users made their presence on 
the site known by tagging photos, sending friend requests, and 'liking' 
their peers' activities.

On
Wednesday, Facebook took the first formal steps in the process to set 
an initial public offering price, and said that they hoped for $5billion
of stock.

Industry analysts see this as an effort to start the push low as the stock is expected to eventually value at $100billion.

Given the fluidity of technology 
trends, the fear of a hot new start-up is a constant one for Facebook, 
but the researchers at Pew seem to think that users' emotional 
connection with the site will keep them logging in for years to come.

The study focused on user demographics, and found that female users are far more active than their male friends.

Female users made 21 updates- which 
could be any form of noticeable activity like sending requests, 
commenting on other posts, or posting their own material- per month, 
while their average male counterpart only made 6 updates in the same 
amount of time.

The
research suggests that it isn't just the fun of clicking away that has 
captured users' attention for the eight years since it was created. It's
the feeling they get in doing so.

Facebook provides a self-esteem boost 
because of the positive emotional connotations that users remember from 
seeing their friends and interacting with them online.

Facebook itself has taken an active role in promoting positive thoughts instead of negative ones as well, by choosing to only offer 'like' buttons on posts and they have resisted calls for the introduction of a 'dislike' button- similar to the one seen on YouTube videos.

'You keep getting all these wonderful positive rewards,' Keith Hampton, the study's author, told The Associated Press.

Those warm, fuzzy feelings that Facebook invokes may be the key to their brand loyalty strategy, which Mr Hampton suggests is working since the user base only continues to expand as the years go on.

'That's pretty hard to give up. For most people, the longer they are on Facebook, the more they do on Facebook,' he continued.
