Monégasque royal Princess Stephanie looked thoroughly at home in the company of a friendly elephant this afternoon when she was guest of honour at the International Circus Festival of Monaco. 

The mother-of-three, who is president of the festival, had no qualms about get up-close and personal with the enormous animal - tickling its trunk, peeking into its mouth and even having a little chat. 

Stephanie, 49, is no stranger to the circus - back in 2000 she had a relationship with a Swiss elephant trainer called Franco Knie and their relationship was serious enough for her to move, along with her children, into his caravan.

The relationship was over by 2003 though and she began a romance with a trapeze artist.

Princess Stephanie of Monaco, 49, visited the International Circus Festival of Monaco today. The royal  ooked thoroughly at home in the company of friendly elephant this afternoon, even looking into its mouth

The Portuguese-Spanish trapeze artist Adans Lopez Peres was ten years younger than her and also a member of the Franco's Circus Knie. 

Today's festival had particularly strong memories for the royal though - It was at the same event back in 2000 that she met Franco, whom she later moved in with. 

But today's visit to the circus,  at the 39th annual event, was far less controversial.

Now she is president and works to help preserve circus traditions for future generations.

The royal is known to be very hands-on and helps oversee the entire operation.

She has input into everything from the selection of acts and the choreography to the costumes, music and lighting, which is why she arrived at the event wearing a casual sweatshirt saying 'staff' rather than anything more glamorous.
