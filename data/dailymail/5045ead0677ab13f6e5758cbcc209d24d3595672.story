Texas A&M football player Thomas Johnson has turned up safe and sound â€“ three days after he went missing.

His mother, Linda Hanks, said A&M University police called her early this morning to say the 18-year-old has been found unharmed.

No other details were immediately available.

Found: Thomas Johnson had vanished on Monday night after leaving his apartment for several days - until he was found in Dallas

ESPN Dallas/Fort Worth reported that the wide receiver was last seen leaving his residence in College Station on Monday at 5pm after skipping class and a team practice.

When he missed practice again on Tuesday and Wednesday, team officials and his family grew concerned.

Johnson was found in Dallas - about 180 miles away from the Texas A&M campus - where he had attended high school.

Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin had released a statement yesterday expressing his concern, saying: 'Authorities are working closely with his family, friends and law enforcement agencies to help locate him.'

Ms Hanks told WFAA-TV that Johnson has not contacted her since his disappearance and that she had no other information.

Johnson has appeared in 10 games this season, and has 30 catches for 339 yards and a touchdown.
