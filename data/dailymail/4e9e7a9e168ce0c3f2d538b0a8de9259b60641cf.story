A golf fan in Rory McIlroy's home town raised the European flag to celebrate victory in the Ryder Cup - only for a confused neighbour to think it was 'Arabic' and call police.

The homeowner in Hollywood, near Belfast, was stunned on Sunday when he had a knock on the door from officers.

They quickly discovered the 12 gold stars on a blue background were simply those of the EU flag, a well-known emblem which has been a familiar sight across the continent for more than 50 years.

False flag: The EU colours were raised outside this house in Hollywood, County Down, to celebrate Europe's victory in the Ryder Cup - but an offended neighbour called police thinking it was an Arabic emblem

The flag's flabbergasted owner asked not to be identified, but said he would take the symbol down to 'keep the peace'.

He posted on Facebook: 'Right in shock here. Had a Ryder Cup party yesterday and just had the police round… as apparently it’s caused offence.

'Apparently person who complained thought it was an Arabic flag.'

Alliance Party councillor Andrew Muir told the BBC: 'In some ways you couldn't make it up.

'It's rather depressing that we would be focused upon flags.

'People are entitled to fly whatever legal flag they want from their house and in Northern Ireland we need to be able to celebrate our success and the European flag is an open, inclusive symbol of Europe coming together.'

Wrong message: The homeowner was a fan of golf and had been holding a party to watch the tournament

Symbol: The European flag was designed more than 50 years ago and is a common sight across the continent

Team Europe triumphed over America in Gleneagles on Sunday for the eighth time in ten tours, retaining the Ryder Cup.

McIlroy played a leading role in the victory and his hometown in County Down did not forget his contribution - stringing up banners and posters and even putting his name on the town sign.

A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed officers had been to the house.

The spokesman added: 'Police in Holywood attended an address in the Woodlands area yesterday following the report from a member of the public that a flag they believed to be offensive had been erected.

'Police attended and no offence was detected.'

There was tension last month on a council estate in Poplar, east London, when a black flag with Arabic writing resembling that of Islamic extremists was flown only to be torn down by an angry nun.

Flags also have a history of controversy in Northern Ireland. There were street protests in 2012 after Belfast City Council voted to restrict the flying of the Union flag from the city hall to 18 days a year.
