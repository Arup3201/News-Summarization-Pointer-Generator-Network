One of the most iconic women's magazines of the last century, Ladies' Home Journal, is ceasing its monthly publication and doing away with subscriptions.

According to Meredith, the Iowa-based 
publishing giant that owns the magazine, Ladies Home Journal is 
'transitioning' the title to 'a special interest publication,' which 
will publish less frequently, in an unknown format.

The publishing world is awash with rumors, and the entire New York-based editorial team was made redundant this morning - with most agreeing that the news spells the end for the magazine, at least as we know it. 

The end of an era: Ladies' Home Journal announced today that it will cease the monthly publication of its magazine and 'transition' it to a 'special interest' periodical instead

The women's lifestyle magazine, which has featured the likes of Michelle Obama, Madonna and former president George Bush on its cover, opened its doors in 1883 and adopted the slogan 'Never
underestimate the power of women' in the mid-Forties, a motto it has kept until
today.

Just two years ago, the publication underwent a major
redesign, placing Kate Winslet on the cover of their first re-vamped issue.
Oscar-winning actress Sally Field graced their latest edition.

Covering the arenas of family, marriage, work, home and
beauty, it has enjoyed a relatively long life as a companion for the mainstream
women of its time.

Struggles: Only two years ago, the magazine underwent a major re-design in an attempt to claw its way back to success, the first cover in the new format fronted by Kate Winslet (pictured)

Material girl: Fashion chameleon Madonna graces this July 2005 issue, looking sharp in a white tweed suit, her hair in a short, curly bob

Political war: The August 2004 issue was released with two covers, one fronted by former president George Bush and his wife Laura (right), and the other with political opponent John Kerry and his wife Teresa (left)

Controversial: A radiantly youthful looking Kelly Preston, posing with husband John Travolta cover this April 2005 cover, in which the Scientologist couple insisted on conducting their interview in the church's Florida headquarters

Often touching on political hot points, the magazine shot two competing covers for its August 2004 issue - half the newsstand issues featuring George Bush and his wife Laura on the cover, and the other half showing political opponents John and Teresa Kerry; both including in-depth interviews with both.

Its 2010 issue profiled first lady Michelle Obama, who dished on her family's health and her eating habits, admitting she can't stand beets and that she occasionally does a dietary cleanse to 'clear her palate' and 'change her mind set'.

Another notable cover starred Scientologists John Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston in 2005, who insisted on conducting their accompanying interview at the controversial church's headquarters in Florida.

Ms Preston, asserted that the religion had made her a better person: '[I'm a] better wife...better mother, better friend,'  she said in the story.

Precious moment: A photo from the magazine's 1995 edition, which captures a mother dutifully sewing the hem of her daughter's wedding dress

Finishing touches: This image, taken from a 1950 edition of Ladies' Home Journal, depicts a neatly groomed woman perfecting the art of baking a cake

Important conundrums: This soap advert from a 1934 issue of the magazine sees one woman ask the crucial question, 'But how do you keep such a nice gloss on your tub?'

One of its most popular and enduring columns was named Can This Marriage Be Saved, which
 was launched in the Fifties.

In it, each member of a couple in a 
troubled marriage explains their view of the problem, a marriage 
counselor offers some solutions, and the outcome is published.

Current
 woes include 'She loves the dog more than me', 'He loves sport more 
than me', and 'His elderly parents are too demanding' - we can only 
guess what sort of problems were sent in during the Fifties.

Back
 in 1884, Ladies' Home Journal was launched under the ownership of 
publishing heavyweight Cyrus Curtis, but it was written and run by his 
wife, Louisa. It was one of the first of its kind; a magazine written 
for women, by women.

Swoon: A glimpse into romance in the Twenties, this 1929 illustration for the magazine depicts a young man proposing to his sweetheart

Wedding belles! A bride dressed in her elaborate nuptials gown is seen being tended to by a maid in uniform, in this 1912 illustration

Spot of golf? Twenty years into the magazine's life, this 1900 cover shows a party of male and female golfers in smart attire on a snowy winter's day

Lady in red: One year later and the golf trend endures, on this 1901 cover, which sees the woman adopt a relatively manly pose for the times

Mrs Curtis, who 
identified herself as a strong feminist, championed women's education in
 the 19th Century and argued that the success of her magazine proved how
 eager women were to read and learn.

The rest of Mrs Curtis' story reads like a publishing world fairytale, as it quickly evolved into a model for mass-circulation magazines.

Women's Journal was the first magazine to reach one million
subscribers, back in 1903, and their covers, in their own words, have provided
'a panoramic picture of life in the United States' since the day the magazine
launched.

Pensive: Somewhat amusingly, this 1922 cover, which features a boy studying with the cover story entitled 'Beginning Foursquare'

Seasons change: This beautiful cover, dating to 1919, advertised for 15 cents, celebrates Fall with a unique, autumnal illustration

Festive: Released in 1926 for ten cents, this cover, featuring an angelic young blonde bundled up for the cold, lists a feature entitled 'A Great Series on the Holy Land'

Winding back the hands of time, there exists a large catalog of vintage covers from over the years, including in 1901 illustration of a woman playing golf in a cape and hat, and a 1929 illustration of a young man proposing to his future bride.

Going to show that the business of love and marriage is an ever-enduring focus for women's magazines, an illustration for the 1912 edition shows a women, not a maid, in an elaborate wedding gown, tended to by her maid. A 1952 photo spread shows a mother lovingly stitching the hem of her daughter's wedding dress.

For one of America's landmark publications, and for its over three million readers, today truly marks the end an era.
