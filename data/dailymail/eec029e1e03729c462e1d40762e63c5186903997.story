From fad diets to savvy gadgets, there are hundred of products claiming to aid the all-important weight loss.

And now, the latest slimming aid comes in the form of a perfume bottle.

Prends–moi is the world’s first slimming fragrance from Velds that has been developed at the French perfume house Robertet.

The latest revolution in slimming comes in a small perfume bottle and costs £29.99

Makers claim the fragrance is designed to ‘slim with pleasure’ and is based on 'aromatherapeutic' and ‘neurocosmetic’ research.

The perfume contains ingredients which release B-endorphins present in the skin and a ‘pleasure message’ is transmitted through the brain triggering a sensation of well being and an increase in contentment reducing the need to overeat.

73% of testers felt a feeling of pleasure when applying the perfume

A ‘Slimming Complex’ formulated with 
caffeine, carnitine and spirulina extract activates the two key enzymes 
directly involved in lipolysis (fat degradation).  

A trial study by BIO-EC of women aged between 18 and 70 years of age, who were not on a diet, found that 75% felt the perfume limited the need to snack and 73% felt a feeling of pleasure.

Generously spritz in
the morning, as you would do with any perfume, and throughout the day 
when the need for snacking arises.

Further results can be achieved by very lightly massaging into targeted areas, morning and 
night to help sculpt and slim the contours of the body.

As for the smell, there are top notes, with lively accents of 
bergamot, mandarin and grapefruit.

With a low alcohol content, Prends-moi is perfect for those
who love summer all year long.

But unfortunately you will have to join a
fast-forming queue of over 6,000 eager customers who are desperate to 
get their hands on the bottles.

A trial study by BIO-EC (Centre of Biological Research and Cutaneous 
Experimentation) of women aged between 18 and 70 years who were not 
either on a diet or medical or dermatological treatment during the whole
duration of the study revealed the following results after 28 days of 
regular use:

•    82% felt a feeling of comfort after application

•    75% thought it had a pleasant fragrance and they would wear it every day

•    73% felt a feeling of pleasure

•    75% felt it limited the need to snack

•    70% felt a feeling of well being

•    70% felt it acting on their eating behaviour
