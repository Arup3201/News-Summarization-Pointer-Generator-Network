 

It's a jungle out there. Particularly when you are shaping up to be today's 'special' on the waterhole lunch menu.

In an astonishing video shot on the African savanna, a pack of seriously hungry jackals and a lone crocodile lurking just below the water's surface, have cornered a warthog.

Now, if you are the prey in this particular scenario - dish of the day for some of animal kingdom's most vicious predators - you already know there is no escape.

A little warthog drinks at a watering hole on the African savanna unaware of the jackals who are stalking him for lunch. But they aren't the only predators in town

The jackals are already licking their lips at the prospect of warthog, served extremely rare. But the crocodile in the YouTube video seems almost casual to the point of disinterest.

Both sets of hunters have an enviable strike rate in this situation, even though crocodiles eat very rarely and jackals tend to hunt alone or in pairs. 

Jackals, carnivores with dog-like features and a bushy tail, tend to live singly or in pairs, only coming together to hunt in small packs.

They have a reputation for being opportunistic, skulking scavengers and would have no problem taking down a warthog.

Crocodiles are amazingly fast when they want to be - swimming at 20mph to catch prey. 

They use their powerful jaws and teeth to crush their meals, often tearing animals apart in chunks or swallowing them whole.

What's on the menu today? Warthog for the pack on the left.  But who is this showing up to the party on the right?  Never underestimate a crocodile

CROCODILES:

JACKALS:

Warthogs are a species of wild pig, who in spite of their ferocious appearance, are omnivorous, eating grasses, roots, fruits, bark, fungi and insects.

Its the the only species of pig that has adapted to grazing in the savanna habitat.

Far from fighting, it would rather run away from trouble - at speeds of up to 30mph - than attack.

Which is a bit unfortunate for our poor warthog in this home movie.

Caught between the bank and the water, he had no place to go.

So who bagged it for lunch?  

It was the crocodile of course.

Leaving some very disappointed jackals yelping  on the sidelines.

The crocodile finally makes its move, lunging forward with its tail and hind legs, jaws open, to grab the warthog

The disappointed jackals can only look on as the crocodile pulls the warthog down with its powerful jaws and drags the prey off for lunch.  The 'dish of the day' is off guys

Amazing video of warthog being stalked by Africa's sneakiest predators

The prey was destined to be lunch for either the crocodile or the jackals

But the outcome was anyone's guess
