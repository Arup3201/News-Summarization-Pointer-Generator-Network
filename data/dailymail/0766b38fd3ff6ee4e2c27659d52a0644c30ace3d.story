This is the terrifying moment a Porsche driver was caught on camera overtaking a group of learner motorcyclists at 113mph - narrowly missing the front rider.

Shocking footage shows David Judd, 30, racing past seven bikers on the wrong side of the busy A631 near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, in his silver £60,000 Porsche 911.

The reckless driver is filmed speeding past the motorcyclists, who are all wearing fluorescent vests, before slamming on the brakes when he spots the police camera.

Motor fanatic: Judd insisted after his trial that it was 'no big deal' and had been 'exciting' but admitted he would not be trying anything similar again

His screeching tyres send smoke billowing across the road as he desperately tries to regain control of his souped-up motor after decelerating from 113mph to 
23mph in just three seconds.

Judd's antics were captured in the 22-second video as he returned from a day trip to Skegness, Lincs. in the luxury car - which has the 
personalised number plate D13 JUD.

Caught out: The driver, from Doncaster, was slapped with a six-month ban and ordered to pay £815 after he was found guilty of careless driving

Judd, from Doncaster, S.Yorks., admitted 
speeding on May 13 last year but denied careless driving when he appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court yesterday.

But he was found guilty, slapped with a six-month ban and ordered to pay £815.

Judd referred to himself in a police interview as an idiot but denied he was 'showing off', a court heard. He said the car was travelling 'faster than he realised' as he overtook.

JPs were told that his car had previously been under-performing but went faster than it used to after an engine fault was fixed.

Steve Smith, defending, said he was 
past the picnic area when he overtook and there was a 'nice' overtaking 
gap between the car and the bikes.

He said there was a safe distance between the vehicles when Judd braked.

Mr Smith added that at no point did 
Judd lose control of his car, attributing a 'slight veer' after braking 
to a technical fault with the braking system.

Speaking after the case, Judd, who runs a car spraypaint business, said: 'It's no big deal.

'I was going pretty fast and I spotted the police camera and slammed on the brakes.

'I knew I was going pretty fast but didn't really know how fast until the police told me.

'To be honest it was pretty exciting but I won't be doing it again soon.

'I've still got the Porsche, I won't be selling it.'

Speaking after the case, John Siddle, from the Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership, said Judd was 'very lucky'.

He said: 'Given that there were pedestrians and novice motorcyclists using the road, anything could have happened.'

Mr Siddle added that only 10 out of 45,000 people caught speeding in Lincolnshire last year were travelling at more than 100mph.
