Business taxes that have existed since Tudor times could be scrapped.

Chancellor George Osborne will today put reform of despised business rates – and more cheap loans for small firms – at the centre of his plans to secure the recovery.

In an unashamedly pro-enterprise Autumn Statement, the Chancellor will reveal that the tax on commercial property in the UK is to be reviewed, paving the way for a fundamental overhaul.

Retailers have long been pushing for reform of rates – which have existed in various forms since 1601 – to ease the pressure on the high street.

Sources suggest that moving away from a charge based on the rateable value of a commercial property to a modern alternative – such as a sales tax – is being considered. The smallest businesses could be exempted altogether.

Critics of the system say that in the age of internet commerce, it is absurd that company taxes are based on the physical space they use. Business rates are often a firm’s third biggest outgoing, after wages and rent.

The British Retail Consortium, the manufacturers’ organisation EEF, the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Property Federation (BPF) have all urged the Chancellor, who has already slashed rates of corporation tax to improve the UK’s competitiveness, to make the business rates system ‘fit for purpose’.

‘Unlike every other tax in the UK, the business rates burden does not fluctuate with the economic cycle, meaning businesses have to pay the same regardless of economic conditions, and this, we argue, must change,’ said Liz Pearce, chief executive of the BPF.

As well as announcing a review of business rates, to draw up reforms to be implemented in the 2016 Budget, Mr Osborne will announce an overhaul and extension of the Treasury and Bank of England’s flagship funding scheme for business.

The Funding For Lending scheme involves the Bank allowing commercial lenders to borrow funds from it cheaply, so that they can pass this on in the form of cheap loans to firms.

The scheme was launched in 2012 with the aim of increasing bank lending by up to £70billion, and was initially available for both mortgage and business lending. Earlier this year, the Government changed the rules so cheap home loans were no longer supported, given the surging housing market. Today the Chancellor will announce another overhaul, ensuring that cash is targeted only at small and medium-sized firms, and extending the scheme, due to end in January, for another year.

He will also pledge an extra £400million for the British Business Bank, which has so far supported 38,000 businesses. Mr Osborne will claim the two measures will unlock £1billion of new finance for small and medium-sized firms, and champion the role of business in building the recovery.

‘The Government’s long-term economic plan is working, with the Funding for Lending scheme playing a vital role in supporting the recovery,’ the Chancellor said.

‘Now that credit conditions for households and large businesses have improved, it is right that we focus the scheme’s firepower on small businesses, which are the lifeblood of our economy.’

In his final Autumn Statement before the General Election, Mr Osborne will tell MPs that Britain ‘faces a choice’.

‘Do we squander the economic security we have gained, go back to the disastrous decisions on spending and borrowing and welfare that got us into this mess? Or do we finish the job – and go on building the secure economy that works for everyone? I say: we stay the course.’

Mr Osborne has been forced to rule out traditional pre-election tax giveaways as experts say he will have to admit that wiping out the vast budget deficit will take longer than previously thought. Despite the setback, the Chancellor is expected to say he intends to enshrine in law a promise to wipe out the budget deficit, in a trap for Labour before the election.

Hospices are to get VAT refunds worth millions of pounds a year. After a long campaign by the hospice movement, George Osborne will agree today that they should receive an annual grant to cover their VAT costs.

Currently, NHS organisations are able to recover VAT on non-business supplies such as catering, laundry, staff training and vehicle and maintenance costs.

But hospices do not enjoy the same advantages – meaning they are unfairly disadvantaged and face large VAT bills.

Mr Osborne will say today that the VAT refund is expected to be worth £4million a year to the sector, though if it is more the bill will still covered.

‘Hospice charities provide vital support services for the NHS and its patients and we want to support their work,’ said a government source.

Search and Rescue and air ambulance charities are to get VAT refunds and more government cash following lobbying by Prince William. In today’s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor will announce VAT breaks for the sector from April, alongside £7.5million extra support for air ambulances. The tax refunds will be worth £25million over five years.

The Duke of Cambridge is said to have been angry at pressure on air-sea rescue services. As a helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey, he has helped out with mountain rescue, Coastguard and air ambulance services.

David Cameron revealed at Prime Minister’s Questions in 2011 that the Prince had urged him to do more to support the services, many of which are run by charities. Today’s measure will mean all 150 search and rescue and air ambulance charities will be able to apply for VAT refunds on all their search and rescue activities as of April 1.

The Chancellor will call a vote on eradicating the underlying deficit – highlighting Ed Balls’s plan to borrow throughout the next parliament. He may also cut a new cap on overall welfare spending.

Labour has promised to balance the books only on day-to-day spending, and carry on borrowing billions of pounds for housing and infrastructure projects.

Mr Balls said last night: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne have now failed every test and broken every promise they made on the economy.

‘This cost-of-living crisis is why the Chancellor will have to admit he has broken his promise to balance the books by next year. A Labour Autumn Statement would set out a better and fairer plan to deliver a recovery that works for the many and not just a few.’
