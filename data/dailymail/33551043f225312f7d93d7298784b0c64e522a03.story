One Gorilla's adorable love of kittens is enough to make anyone purr.

Koko is a 38-year-old lowland Gorilla who not only learned to speak sign language as a baby but who has grown a love for kittens whom she treats like her own children, says The Gorilla Foundation website.

Dr. Penny Patterson whose been working with Koko for 30 years can be heard narrating a viral video in which Koko plays with two kittens she chose from a litter of seven one week prior. The priceless footage has almost half a million views.

She scoops one up and immediately cradles it in her arms as if it were her own baby gorilla

Koko plays with both her kitten friends at the same time to make sure they get equal attentionÂ 

The video begins by Koko taking two 
kittens out of their resting area. She immediately scoops them into her 
arm like a baby and cuddles them close to her heart.

Koko is so thrilled to be handing two fury kittens that she even lets out a big gorilla purring sound.

Next Koko plays with both the kittens at once by tickling their bellies and rubbing their little heads.

Dr. Penny Patterson introduces a few toys into the
 mix like a stuffed owl, an egg baby, and lizard. Koko seems to be more 
concerned with the kittens than the toys because she immediately takes 
the toys off the table where the kitten is sitting.

Perhaps
 the most maternal Koko moment is when she takes a toy slice of cake and
 shows the kitten how to eat it. Mamma gorilla takes a pretend bite then offers another 
nibble to the kitty.

When 
the interaction comes to a close and its time for Koko to return to her room, 
she plops the kitten on her back and attempts to take her with her so that they can truly be a family.

Koko may not have children of her own but she is willing to open her heart to an even different species all together.

Koko prefers one on one time with the kitten without any toy distractions unless of course it's to teach the kitten a life lesson...
