A South Texas beauty spa owner has been sentenced to three years in prison for illegally injecting liquid silicone into clients at her salon, a practice that led to the death of one woman.

Federal prosecutors said in a statement on Friday that 38-year-old Elva Navarro of Hidalgo injected at least 30 women and falsely told them she was trained and certified to provide the injections.

They say one woman died in October 2013 after receiving an injection at Navarro's spa in McAllen. Another client became sick and was hospitalized in 2012.

Use of the liquid silicone is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Navarro pleaded guilty in June to one count of receiving through interstate commerce an adulterated device with the intent to defraud or deceive.

Breitbart.com reports that Navarro was caught after a female customer complained of pain following injections from Navarro.

The woman who was hoping to a beauty treatment spent 17 days at a hospital, recovering from damage caused by injections that cost her $750, reported the Harlingen Morning Star.

The hospitalized woman had been injected with 'liquid silicone' and as a result, had to undergo several corrective surgeries, reports Fox. 

The McAllen Monitor reports that Navarro has a rich criminal history.

In November 2013 Navarro was arrested for practicing medicine without a license and in 2012 she was arrested for allegedly kidnapping a student and holding her ransom.
