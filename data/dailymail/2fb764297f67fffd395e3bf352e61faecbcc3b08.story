Thug: Lukasz Sklepkowski, 29, who slammed the Metropolitan Police dog's head in a door repeatedly

A thug who repeatedly slammed a door on a police dog’s head walked free from court with just a community order.

The wounded German Shepherd was one of only seven dogs working for the Metropolitan Police which are trained to abseil in firearms situations.

Polish Lukasz Sklepkowski, 29, trapped the animal, named Zinzan, as officers were searching for lost property in Edgware, north London, last October.

It suffered severe bruising in the attack.

Sklepkowski was found guilty in his 
absence after he failed to turn up for his case at Hendon Magistrates’ Court in north-west London last December.

He was later arrested after handing himself in to police and was sentenced yesterday.

The incident took place when police searching for lost property were told that the Pole was hiding in bushes.

Sklepkowski ran off and ignored officers’ calls to stop, Zinzan and his handler chased him to a nearby flat frequented by drug users.

As Zinzan tried to follow him inside, Sklepkowski trapped the dog’s neck in the door and slammed it several times.

After a struggle to prise the door open, officers managed to free the wounded dog, surround the property and arrest the Pole.

The animal was later rushed to a vet for treatment.

Wounded: Zinzan who suffered severe bruising in the attack and his handler PC Dan Revill

Zinzan’s handler, Pc Dan Revill, said he had now 'thankfully' made a full recovery and described him as being 'pretty chilled out'.

He said: 'He had severe bruising to his head and neck and was on the strongest painkillers available while he recovered.

'He was reluctant to leave me for the first week, but we gave him a week of light training to ease him back to work and he has now returned to full duties.'

Sklepkowski, of no fixed address, was yesterday given a 12-month community order.

He was also 
sentenced to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £300 
costs and £50 towards vets bills.

He was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering under the Animal Welfare Act.
