She's a party planner by profession so it comes as little surprise that Pippa Middleton is a social butterfly.

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister was spotted enjoying lunch with a female friend yesterday and today she opted to hang out with male pal, Jons Bartholdson.

The 30-year-old looked summertime chic in a colourful blue and lime skirt and top combo by Tabitha Webb, which she accessorised with her favourite Aspinal of London Marylebone Tech (which she loves to charge her phone in on the go).

She made the most of the hottest day of the year by displaying her tanned legs and accessorising with oversized shades.

Pippa, who is currently dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, recently completed a cycling race across America with Jons, who hails from Sweden.

Having a laugh: Pippa and Jons Bartholdson cycled across America together so it comes as no surprise that they had a lot to chat about

The pair and their team had set off from California last fortnight on the 
Race Across America with the aim of crossing 12 states to raise money 
for charity.

They cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, 
Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania 
and Maryland.

After finishing, Pippa described the experience as 'brilliant'.

Pippa
and her team were raising money for the British Heart Foundation - which
has appointed her as an ambassador - and The Michael Matthews 
Foundation, named after a British adventurer who died in 1999, aged 22, 
on Mount Everest.

It's been a busy few weeks for the brunette. The
 royal sibling was spotted enjoying the tennis from the Royal box 
with her brother James last week and yesterday indulged in an altogether more 
low key affair as she was spotted deep in conversation with a female friend as 
they took their time over a bite to eat.

What an achievement! Pippa and Jons, second from right, completed a cycling race across America covering 3,000 miles in six days, ten hours and 54 minutes

She also recently sat down for her first ever TV 
interview to tell the world 'what it is like to be Pippa'.

Until
now, the 30-year-old magazine columnist has never spoken publicly on 
her life in the spotlight as sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate 
Middleton - or that bridesmaid's dress which brought her so much 
attention at the Royal Wedding in 2011. Â 

Miss
Middleton was interviewed by Today's Matt Lauer who had flown to London
to speak with her for a two-part segment.
