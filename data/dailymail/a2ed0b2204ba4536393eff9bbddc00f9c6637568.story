One of Britain’s most popular bacon brands contains so much salt that eating just four rashers puts people over the recommended daily limit.

Tests have revealed that 100g of grilled Wall’s unsmoked bacon contains 7.1g of salt.

It means that a typical breakfast sandwich containing four rashers of the bacon would provide more than the total daily recommended intake of 6g of salt.

High salt intake increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes by raising blood pressure.

Last night, health campaigners urged Wall’s to ‘stop dragging their heels’ and cut salt levels.

Sonia Pombo, a nutritionist with the charity Consensus Action on Salt & Health, said: ‘Wall’s seem to be completely ignoring Government advice to reduce the level of salt in their products, even though it would benefit customers’ health.

‘Bacon can be made with much lower levels of salt. We urge them, and other companies alike, to stop dragging their heels, and make significant reductions in salt.’

Wall’s was found to make the saltiest bacon in a survey by the firm Can I Eat It?, which has developed a mobile phone app to help shoppers tell how healthy food products are.

Their survey looked at how much salt there was in 100g of grilled bacon from a number of leading brands.

They found Wall’s unsmoked bacon contained 7.1g per 100g, or 1.7g per grilled rasher.

Second was Morrisons M Savers bacon with 5.5g per 100g, and third I Love unsmoked back bacon, containing 5.3g per 100g.

Asda’s Extra Special Dry bacon has just 3.4g per 100g after grilling.

Can I Eat It? founder Martin Isark described the amount of salt in Wall’s unsmoked as ‘a disgrace’.

He said: ‘Just four crispy rashers of Wall’s unsmoked bacon for your breakfast would not be seen as greedy, but that would be more than the daily allowance in one go.

'That’s without beans, sausages, tinned tomatoes, eggs, ketchup, bread and butter.

‘Wall’s are out of step with health organisations and their competitors – their customers deserve better.’

A spokesman for Wall’s, owned by Irish foods giant Kerry Group, said the salt content of its unsmoked bacon was 3.11g per 100g before cooking – ‘in line with other manufacturers and other products in this survey’.

When it was pointed out that all the brands were compared on a like-for-like basis, he would not explain why Wall’s was the saltiest.

He said: ‘We remain committed to looking at new ways to reduce salt content of our products, without compromising on the great taste our customers love.’
