Police in the Philippines admitted today they had blundered in trying to end the hostage drama that resulted in eight tourists being shot dead by a crazed gunman as they sat in terror on a hijacked bus.        

Commandos fired dozens of bullets into the bus and struck at its windows with sledgehammers as they tried to storm it, but were forced to wait outside helplessly for more than an hour as the  maddened hijacker used the tourists as human shields.

As a storm of criticism about police tactics erupted, Manila police commander Leocadio Santiago admitted: 'We made mistakes.'

'We saw some obvious shortcomings in 
terms of capability and tactics 
used, or the procedure employed, and we are now going to investigate this.'

But an investigation after the bloody
 event has failed to placate Hong
 Kong's government after it watched its nationals - as well as two British citizens who survived - live through hours of 
terror on the hijacked bus after it had been commandeered by 
disgruntled policeman Rolando 
Mendoza, 55.

One of the survivors, who identified 
herself only as Mrs Leung, said 
as she scrambled from the bus after Mendoza had finally been shot dead: 'The police should not have waited so 
long.

'There were so many people on the bus
 but no-one came to our rescue. Why?'

That was a question also being asked 
by Philippines president Benigno 
Aquino, who promised to investigate all aspects of the 12-hour ordeal, which began when Mendoza boarded the bus in a
 tourist area and demanded to be 
given a ride.        

But shortly afterwards the Hong Kong 
tourists realised they were in 
trouble when he ordered the driver to lock the door and began waving his M-16 assault rifle around.        

As police eventually closed in on the
 bus he sprayed the hostages with
 bullets, killing Mrs Leung's husband as he dived across her to try to protect her.

'This tragedy highlights many flaws 
in the ability of Philippine 
security forces to hand hostage situations,' said President Aquino, who came to power two months ago.

'There are a lot of things that 
resulted in a tragedy. Obviously we should be improving.'

He claimed that one of the problems 
was the way the crises was played
 out through the media, with the gunman being allowed to speak on radio and watch events live on the bus's tv, 
giving him insights into police 
actions.

But the President insisted that 
waiting for more than 10 hours had
 been the right thing for the police to do. 'Up to that point the police believed they could convince the 
gunman to stand down.'

During a tense few minutes police had
 the opportunity to shoot Medoza 
with a sniper's bullet as he stood in the open doorway of the bus talking to police negotiators.

Had they decided no chances were to 
be taken with a man who had 
already shown himself to be dangerous by hijacking the bus with an assault rifle, eight lives would not have 
been lost.

In Hong Kong relatives of the victims
 expressed anger over the bloody 
end to the stand-off. 'The way it was handled - particularly the outcome - is very disappointing,' said Hong 
Kong Chief Executive
  Donald Tsang.

Hong Kong newspapers criticised the 
opportunities that had been lost 
to end the siege much earlier.

'A large group of police failed to 
get into the bus after surrounding
 the vehicle for nearly half an hour,' said the Hong Kong Economic Journal.

'Their appalling professional 
standards and the lack of strategic planning made observers both angry and sad. This tragedy could 
have been avoided.'

In the former British protectorate 
flags flew at half mast and the 
Hong Kong stock exchange held a minute's silence.

Mendoza had seized the bus to make 
public his demands to be 
reinstated as a police officer after his sacking amid claims of extortion against him.

Before being discharged, he had been 
regarded as a model officer, once
 being named as among the top 10 policemen in the country.

Last night two chartered flights were
 on their way to take relatives 
of the hostages to Manila. Psychologists, doctors and social workers were also on the flights.
