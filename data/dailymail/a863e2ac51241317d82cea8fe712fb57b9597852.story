With its gentle drama and quaint childhood adventures, Little House On The Prairie painted a picture of wholesome family life in 19th century Midwest America.

Set in the God-fearing town of Independence, Kansas, plotlines rarely ventured beyond the 
realms of Sunday School and town gossip and real trouble meant somebody 
being late for dinner.

But behind these tales of youthful innocence that brought fame to the town across the world, lurks a ghoulish story of real-life abduction and serial killing that author Laura Ingalls Wilder neglected to mention.

Some 17 miles south of Independence, the township of Osage became the scene of a brutal campaign of murder by a family that became known as the Bloody Benders.

The family: John Sr spoke with a gruff, guttural voice that was barely understandable while his wife was apparently so unfriendly that her neighbors took to calling her 'She-Devil'

The children: While their parents tended to keep themselves to themselves, John Jr. (left) and Kate (right) were known about the town of Osage and regularly attended Sunday church. She also claimed to be psychic healer

The family consisted of John 'Pa' Bender, 60, his wife Mrs. 'Ma' Bender (later referred to as Kate Sr. since no one knew her given name), 55, son John Jr. and daughter Kate.

Originally immigrants from Europe, John Sr reportedly had such a gruff voice that, coupled with his strong foreign accent, him barely understandable while his wife was apparently so unfriendly that her neighbours took to calling her 'She-Devil'.

While their parents tended to keep themselves to themselves, the children John Jr., and Kate, both in their 20s, were known about the town and regularly
 attended Sunday church. Kate also claimed to be psychic healer.

Television: The Little House on the Prairie ran from 1974 to 1983. Set in the God-fearing town of Independence, Kansas, plotlines rarely ventured beyond the realms of Sunday School and real trouble meant somebody being late for dinner

The family, believed to have been of German or Dutch origin, ran a bed and breakfast for travellers passing across the frontier. They lived in the back of their cabin. In the front, beginning in 1871, they operated a small inn and store.

It was there that they took to murdering and robbing at least a dozen travellers who stayed at the lodging between 1871 and 1873.

So many disappearances were reported over that period that it is unclear exactly how many victims there actually were.

Mass grave: This photograph from 1873 shows the graves found behind the Bender farm. It was noticed that the Benders' garden was always freshly plowed but never planted

More bodies: This is a stereographic photo shows a grave found under a trap door at the Bender house. Around a dozen bodies were found, including various body parts

It is believed their method was to smash their guests over the head with a hammer during dinner from behind a strategically-placed curtain before tipping their body through a trap door into a made-to-measure cellar.

One of the women would then leap on the victim and cut their throat to seal their death.

Once in the cellar, they stripped the body, taking anything they could find of value, and later buried somewhere on the property, often in the orchard.

It was noticed that the Bendersâ€™ garden was always freshly ploughed but never planted.

Suspicions were aroused and rumours spread within the village after a number of locals went missing but no official inquiries were made. It was not until

Dr William York had vanished after 
setting out in search of neighbour George Loncher and his daughter who 
themselves had vanished after leaving Independence for a better life.

Neither Mr Locher, his daughter, or Dr York were ever found.

Dr York's brother, Kansas State Senator Alexander M. York, launched a hunt for his missing sibling but to no avail.

On
 April 3, Colonel York returned to the inn with armed men after a woman 
fled the lodging claiming Ma Bender had threatened her with knives.

House of horror: The Benders would smash their guests over the head with a hammer from behind a strategically-placed curtain before tipping their body through a trap door into a made-to-measure cellar

Ma allegedly could not understand 
English while the younger Benders denied the claim. When York repeated 
the allegation, Ma flew into a rage and branded the woman a witch who had 
cursed her coffee and ordered the men to leave her house.

It was this outburst that revealed for 
the first time that 'her sense of the English language' was much better 
than had been thought.

Before York left, Kate bid him to pay
 a second visit the next Friday night when she promised to use her 
clairvoyant skills and contact the spirit world to help him find his 
missing brother.

The 
men with York were convinced the Benders were guilty and wanted to hang 
them all but York insisted that evidence must be found.

However, as suspicions strengthened and the finger of blame pointed stoutly towards the family.

As
 more people vanished, a town meeting decided the perpetrators of the 
crimes had to be found and a search of every home in the area was 
authorised. Pa Bender and his son both attended the meeting.

Then,
 within two weeks of the meeting a passer by noticed the Benders' 
livestock had not been fed and it became clear the family had slipped 
into the night, never to be seen again.

When the house was finally searched, their possessions were gone. What remained was a grim collection of more than a dozen bodies and various body parts buried in the property's grounds. One was even discovered in the well.

The first to be found was that of Dr York. He was buried face down with his feet barely below the surface among trees in the orchard.

As more corpses were unearthed, the true tally of their murderous spree gradually became clear. All victims but one had been hit over the head and their throats cut.

Just the body of a young girl was found with no injuries sufficient to cause death. It was speculated that she had been strangled or buried alive alongside her mother.

A state-wide manhunt was launched but the family was never found. Their true identities have been the source of speculation ever since.

In the weeks following the discovery, 12 men 'of bad repute in general' were arrested, accused of  disposing of the victims' stolen goods.

In Thayer, 12 miles north of the Bender inn, inquiries revealed that four people fitting the Benders' description had boarded a train for Humboldt, Kansas.

The Humboldt station manager said that there the family split with 
John Jr. and Kate taking a train south, and Ma and Pa Bender, 
carrying a doghide trunk (possibly loaded with money), had taken a second train to St. Louis.

A team of lawmen managed to pick up the family's trail as far as Texas and tailed them to El Paso and into the Chihuahua Desert. But they lost track in the end and were forced to give up and return home.

In October 31, 1889, two women arrested for larceny in Niles, Michigan, were identified as Ma and Kate Bender. They were brought back to Kansas. But after being held for two months they were released on grounds of insufficient evidence against them.

There were various alleged sightings since but none led to any arrests. There have been suggestions that they joined a troupe of outlaws in New mexico, others that they fled to the East Coast, even to Europe.

In a speech at a book fair in a Detroit department store in 1937, Laura Ingalls Wilder spoke of how the murders affected the community in which she lived.

'The night of the day the bodies were found a neighbor rode up to our 
house and talked earnestly with Pa,' she said. 'Pa took his rifle down from its 
place over the door and said to Ma, "The vigilantes are called out."

'Then he saddled a horse and rode away with the neighbor. It was late the
 next day when he came back and he never told us where he had been.

'For 
several years there was more or less a hunt for the Benders and reports 
that they had been seen here or there. At such times Pa always said in a
 strange tone of finality, "They will never be found."'
