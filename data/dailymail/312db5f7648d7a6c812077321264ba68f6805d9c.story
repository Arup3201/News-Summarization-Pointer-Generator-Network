South Sydney lost a second Burgess brother on Wednesday when former Leeds forward Luke signed a two-year deal with Manly.

The 27-year-old Yorkshireman, who was included in the England squad in 2012, has made 51 NRL appearances since joining the Rabbitohs from the Rhinos in 2011 and in 2014 was a member of the Bunnies' first premiership-winning side in 43 years.

He made history two years ago when he played alongside his three brothers for Souths but was on Wednesday released from his contract to enable him to make the move to the Sea Eagles.

Middle brother Sam left the club at the end of last season to switch codes with Bath and now only twins Tom and George remain with Souths, who will play St Helens in the World Club Challenge on February 22.

'Luke has done a great job for us over the past three seasons I've been with the club and an opportunity has come up for him to join Manly,' Rabbitohs coach Michael Maguire said.

'He's a quality front rower who has played over 50 first grade games for this club, and we wish him, his partner Yolanda and daughter Grace, all the best at Manly.'

It was the second major departure of the day for Souths who announced that chief executive Shane Richardson was leaving to take up a job at the NRL.

Richardson, a former chief executive of Gateshead Thunder and Hull, left the reigning premiers after 11 years at the helm and will take up the role of game strategy and development at League Central in March.
