Peruvian authorities have managed to rescue five women from the Pacific Ocean after their hot air balloon crashed into the sea near Canete, about 60 miles south of Lima.

The women were found clinging to the basket of the balloon on Sunday after eight hours in the freezing water.

The women have been taken to hospital, but a police helicopter and navy boats are still searching for the pilot and another man.

Lucky to be alive: One of the women being lifted onto the police helicopter after all of five of them were found clinging to the basket of the balloon

Dangerous: None of the passengers had been wearing life jackets and there was no GPS tracker on the balloon

Desperate: It took eight hours to recover the tourists from the freezing sea

Search party: A police helicopter and navy boats found the women were found clinging to the basket of the balloon to stay afloat

Off course: The tour was meant to fly along the coast but strong winds blew it out to sea, leaving its passengers stranded

None of the people aboard the flight were wearing life jackets.Â  The Interior Minister blasted the balloon's owner, Globos Peru SAC, for failing to provide flotation devices and not equipping it with a GPS tracker.

Reports suggest the missing men may have tried to swim to shore for help. All of the people on board are believed to be Peruvian.

Volunteers also combed the area south of the capital Lima in fishing boats and jet skis.

'Hopefully we can find them as soon as possible,' Minister Wilfredo Pedraza told a state-run TV station. 'All we know is that one of them tried to swim to the coast. The search will continue, even at night, until they are rescued.'

Survivors: Two, including the pilot, were still missing after the women were rescued by the Navy

Criticized: The Peruvian Interior Minister criticized the company, Globos Peru SAC, for not supplying life vests or a GPS locator

Nightmare: A passenger arriving in blankets after surviving the hypothermic conditions

Safety: The women are being treated in a naval hospital in Peru

Balloon
company manager Luis Fernandez says strong winds pushed the balloon off
its planned route along the coast and out over the Pacific.

In February a hot air balloon crashed in Luxor, Egypt, killing 19 tourists.

NFL player Donte Stallworth and his girlfriend were badly burned in March when a hot air balloon they were riding in crashed south of Miami.
