Despite near-global adulation signaled by his recognition as Time person of the year for 2013, not everyone is in raptures over Pope Francis' attempts to rebrand the Catholic Church.

Home Depot founder Kenneth Langone, who is estimated to be worth $2.1 billion, has baulked at what he sees as hyper-critical comments aimed at the rich by the pontiff in his first published exhortation Evangelii Gaudium - fearing that he does not comprehend rich Americans.

Langone, 78, who is a devout Catholic has called the statements attributed to the pope on capitalism as 'exclusionary' and pointedly said that one wealthy anonymous benefactor he knows is reconsidering the seven-figure donation he wants to make to the restoration of Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue.

Unimpressed: Ken Langone, Director and co-founder of Home Depot, Yumi Brands, Choicepoint and former director of The New York Stock Exchange has expressed his dissatisfaction with some of Pope Francis' comments on the wealthy

In an interview with CNBC, Langone said that the donor, who he would not name, was becoming concerned at the message the Argentinian pope was espousing - in which he urges the rich to give more to the poor and attacks a 'culture of prosperity' that causes some to become 'incapable of feeling compassion for the poor'.

Langone told the network that he has personally raised his worries with Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.

'I've told the cardinal, 'Your Eminence, this is one more hurdle I hope we don't have to deal with,' said Langone.

'You want to be careful about generalities. Rich people in one country don't act the same as rich people in another country.'

Worried that the Pope does not understand wealthy American's, Langone, who prays every morning, said that he has told Cardinal Dolan that 'you got more with honey than vinegar' and that he wants the archbishop to make it clear to the pope that wealthy Americans are the largest givers to charity in the world.

'There is no nation on earth that is so forthcoming, so giving,' he said to CNBC, adding that he hopes the pope can 'celebrate a positive point of view rather than focusing on the negative.'

He does worry, though he said, because of 'the vast difference between the Popeâ€™s experience in Argentina and how we are in America. There is no nation on earth that is so forthcoming, so giving.'

Under threat: Kenneth Langone told Cardinal Timothy Dolan - the archbishop of New York that an anonymous donor was considering withholding a seven-figure donation towards New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral because of the pope's comments

In his first exhortation which was published in November, Pope Francis pointed his finger at 'an economy of exclusion and inequality' and blamed capitalist ideologies that 'defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.'

However, for his part, Dolan told CNBC that he had spoken to Langone and tried to allay his fears and that of the potential, but anonymous donor who wants to contribute to the estimated $180 million renovation costs.

'Well, Ken, that would be a misunderstanding of the Holy Father's message,' said Cardinal Dolan.

'The pope loves poor people. He also loves rich people.' ... So I said, 'Ken, thanks for bringing it to my attention. We've gotta correct to make sure this gentleman understands the Holy Father's message properly.' And then I think he's gonna say, 'Oh, OK. If that's the case, count me in for St. Patrick's Cathedral.'

Dolan told CNBC that he did not know the would-be donor's name and Langone said that he would not name him - only that he was upset about the pope's comments about the rich.

Pope Francis delivers his Christmas Day message from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica on December 25, 2013 in Vatican City, Vatican. The 'Urbi et Orbi' blessing (to the city and to the world) is recognised as a Christmas tradition by Catholics

Indeed, according to the Charities Aid Foundation, the United States ranks No.1 as in the World Giving Index and proportionally, more Americans give to charity than any country on Earth.

Dolan said that the pope is aware of the 'legendary generosity of the Catholic Church in the United States.'

Speaking to CNBC, Arthur Brooks, head of the American Enterprise Institute said that he agrees with Langone that the pope is speaking from his life in Argentina - a country known for economic uncertainty and corruption.

'In places like Argentina, what they call free enterprise is a combination of socialism and crony capitalism,' he said.

Going further, Brooks said that while the pope's exhortation read in its original Spanish was 'good and right and beautiful', it suffers from a 'limited understanding of economics from the American context.'

Critical: Senator John McCain and radio host Rush Limbaugh have been critical of the pope's message and Limbaugh dubbed it 'Marxist'

He also said that Pope Francis 'is not an economist and not an American.'

'For American Catholics and Americans in general, we have a moral responsibility to the poor to spread the word of true free enterprise around the world,' Brooks said.

'By doing that, we have the best shot of meeting the Holy Father's objectives, which are good objectives.'

During his rise to almost rock-star status the pope has suffered a backlash from some on the American right.

Republican Sen. John McCain and  conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, have weighed in on Francis' statements, with the latter calling it 'pure Marxism.'
