Adrian Sutil has revealed he didn't eat for two days in a desperate attempt to meet new Formula One weight regulations this season.

The 31-year-old German, who is among the tallest and subsequently heavier drivers in the paddock, raced without a drinks bottle at the heat-sapping grands prix in Malaysia and Bahrain earlier this season, to keep his weight to a minimum.

The limit of car and driver has been raised to 692 kilograms this year to accommodate the heavier 1.6-litre turbo engines.

Weighty issue: Adrian Sutil, speaking to Lewis Hamilton, revealed he did not eat for two days earlier this year

But the sport's heaviest drivers remain at a disadvantage with every extra kilo of weight believed to cost half-a-tenth of a second.

And speaking ahead of round five of this year's championship in Spain, Sutil admitted he avoided eating for 48 hours in a bid to lose weight.

'I was testing it a little bit here and there. Two days, no food, only drink. I tried,' Sutil said. 'It was not easy but interesting what the reaction is. I'm eating now again and it's better.'

Smiles better: Jean-Eric Vergne, speaking to the media on Thursday, was hospitalised earlier this season

Sutil's revelations come after Toro Rosso driver Jean-Eric Vergne admitted he was hospitalised after the season opener in Australia due to a strict diet regime.

Sutil added: 'I couldn't do much sport because the power was missing. I do it because I want to go on the limit just to make sure I did my maximum. I don't want to be in the car and say, "Oh, I could have done more".

'I could feel there was a limit where I hadn't the power anymore, the strength in my mind - you get stressed quite early - and you don't want that. It's just important to know your body quite well.

'I tried it but I'm still alive so don't worry too much. It was my own decision, this is most important.'
