Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic lost his head and saw red after pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in retaliation to a terrible tackle during Saturday's 1-1 draw.

But his reaction appeared serene in comparison to Shabir Khan's moment of madness during Worcester City's ill-tempered clash with Stockport County.

The Worcester left back reacted badly to a rash challenge by Stockport County's Charlie Russell and picked up the young midfielder and WWE style, body slammed him to the floor in the dying seconds of Saturday's Conference North clash.

Khan unsurprisingly was shown a straight red card. Russell escaped with a booking.

Stockport were already down to 10 men after striker Jack Ryan was sent off for two bookable offences as they went down to a 2-0 defeat.
