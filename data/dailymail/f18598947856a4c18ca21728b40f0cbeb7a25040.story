If you're good enough, you're old enough.

That's clearly the stance at AC Milan, who promoted 15-year-old wonderkid Hachim Mastour to their senior squad on Tuesday.

There is even talk he could make his Serie A debut on Sunday against Sassuolo.

Welcome aboard! Hachim Mastour, 15, has been promoted to AC Milan's first team after impressing

Signed, sealed, delivered: The wonderkid moved to the club for £500,000 from Reggina last year

He would become Milan's youngest ever player, eclipsing the great Paolo Maldini, who made his debut aged 16 years and 208 days in 1985.

The forward completed a £500,000 move from Reggina last year and has been a standout performer for Italy's junior sides. 

And he has freestyled with Barcelona's Neymar to show off just how good he is.

Mastour, who turns 16 next month, is set to have a bright future at the San Siro - although he will have to do well to have half the career of Maldini.

Adriano Galliani announced that he'd become a part of the club's first team ahead of next season.
