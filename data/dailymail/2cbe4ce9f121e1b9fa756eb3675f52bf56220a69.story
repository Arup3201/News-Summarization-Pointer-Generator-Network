This abandoned asylum was one of Britain’s first 'villa-style' psychiatric hospitals - but since closing down 10 years ago, it is now a mess of crumbling brick walls and haunting empty corridors.

Bangour Village Hospital, near Dechmont in West Lothian, opened in 1906 for Edinburgh’s 'lunatic paupers', and for almost 100 years housed patients with mental health problems from across Central Scotland.

But after St John’s Hospital opened in nearby Livingston in 1989, it was slowly shut down, and in 2004 the last remaining ward was closed.

Today, it 
is a relic of its former past, and its Grade A-listed buildings leave a 
chill down your spine as you walk around the 960 acre estate.

Built
 on the Bangour Estate, which was bought by the Edinburgh District 
Lunacy Board (EDLB) in 1902, it was set up as a new style of psychiatric
 hospital based on the Continental Colony system.

This approach had been developed at Alt-Scherbitz near Leipzig, Germany, and aimed to give patients a more calming environment for the duration of their stay.

Bangour’s spacious and almost resort-like set-up was the result of a competition by the EDLB, won by Edinburgh architect Hippolyte Blanc known for his Gothic Revival style.

Blanc decided on the idea of a series of
 'villas', set in the 17th century Scottish Renaissance style to house 
patients, with surrounding buildings acting as services.

In 1915, the hospital was requisitioned by the Army for military use, and with added temporary marquees, housed more than 3,000 wounded servicemen by 1918. Pictured above in 1916

Each could house between 25 to 40 patients with the non-medical staff separated by a complex of workshops, stores, a kitchen, and the main hospital block.

Bedrooms were also situated upstairs in an attempt to try and move patients away from the typical stresses and difficulties of institutional life.

By the end of 1905, there were up to 200
 patients in residence at the facility, and recently it was discovered 
that 566 patients had been buried in unmarked graves in nearby 
cemeteries.

Its future still remains uncertain, after talks between a Birmingham-based Islamic trust, NHS Lothian and West Lothian Council of turning it into a residential university fell through in 2011

In 1915, the hospital was requisitioned by the Army for military use, and with added temporary marquees, housed more than 3,000 wounded servicemen by 1918.

The influx of soldiers meant that patients with mental disorders were displaced from the site and relocated to other asylums across Scotland.

In 1922, it reopened as a psychiatric institution and a Village Church was built to mark its reuse and serve as a war memorial.

Following the outbreak of World War II, 
the complex was turned into the Edinburgh War Hospital in 1939 with a 
large annex built to increase its capacity.

After the war, the annex was converted into Bangour General Hospital, and Bangour Village Hospital returned to being a psychiatric hospital.

The disused site has a reputation among nearby residents for being haunted by the spirits of deceased patients.

One former hospital employee who worked there in the 1980s described it as a 'sinister' place to live and was filled with 'shell-shocked' veterans of The First World War.

He said: 'Ward 9 was most likely the one
 ward that gained an awful reputation for being haunted, where strange 
things did indeed happen.

'I worked in there for seven months... and I still get goosebumps at the thought of working alone upstairs in that place.

'Strange voices, moving furniture, and doors closing and pushing against you. Of course, there were psychiatric patients having strange conversations and looking like they knew exactly what was going on in that place.'

During the 1930s, Bangour became a tuberculosis sanatorium with the fresh air and food from its own home farm being vital to patients’ recuperation.

The last patients left the hospital in 2004, just under a century after the first arrived, and in 2005 the complex was used as a location for the psychological thriller film, The Jacket, starring Keira Knightley, Adrien Brody and Daniel Craig.
