A young mother and three teenage boys have been found shot dead in their car in a former mountain resort in Tennessee after they were deliberately targeted.

A resident came across the murdered bodies of Rikki Jacobson, 22, Domonic Davis, 17, John Lajeunesse, 16, and Steven Presley, 17, in Crab Orchard on Thursday.

It was not clear when they were shot dead, but investigators believe they were killed in the 24 hours before they were found, investigators said.

Police said Jacob Alan Bennett, 26, is a suspect in the murders but has not yet been charged.

Killed: Young mother Rikki Jacobsen, 22, and her 17-year-old nephew Domonic Davis (both pictured), were shot dead in a car that was found parked along a secluded track in a Tennessee mountain town

Close: The victims, who were found on Thursday morning, are pictured with Rikki's four-year-old son

He
was picked up in Dayton, Tennessee at around 1am on Friday by the Rhea 
County Sheriff's Department on unrelated charges.

He remains in custody at the Cumberland 
County Sheriff's Office and is being held on a parole violation warrant.

He has a lengthy criminal history and has been in prison five times, police said.

'The suspect knew the victims to some degree,' District Attorney General Randy York said at a press conference on Friday but would not provide further details.

During a news conference on Friday, 
prosecutors and police gave no indication of a possible motive. Asked if
the crime was drug-related, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director 
Mark Gwyn said that most crimes of this type involve drugs.

Arrest: Jacob Bennett, 26, is suspected of shooting dead a woman and three teen boys in a rural Tennessee town. He has not yet been charged and is being held on an unrelated parole charge

Found: The bodies were found inside this blue Dodge Neon that was abandoned at Renegade Mountain

Concerns: Residents were suspicious of the car as the former mountain resort is not densely populated

A Facebook post by a close friend of 
Rikki and Domonic suggested the killings could have been related to 
drugs. The friend refers to Domonic as Rikki's nephew.

On
her own Facebook profile, Rikki, who worked as a cashier at WalMart, 
wrote a heartfelt letter to her young son, who is believed to be four 
years old.

'On the day 
you were born to forever and a day I have and will always love you,' she
wrote to him. 'Nothing can and will separate the strong loving bond of a
mother and her son!'

A
resident came across the blue Dodge Neon that was parked on an unpaved 
road off one of Renegade Mountain's main streets at 7am on Thursday.

'They knew that nobody lives on that 
street, and [the car] just looked odd sitting there,' Cumberland County 
Sheriff Butch Burgess told WATE.

He added: 'Knock on wood, we've not had any [cases] gone unsolved. And we don't want this to be the one that does.'

The
community, which was a former ski resort and golf club, is 50 miles 
west of Knoxville. It is now home to just 43 residents, most of which 
are young families.

Burgess and other officials contacted 
the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which sent a specialized crime 
lab from Nashville. The TBI is still working at the scene.

John
Moore, the president of the Renegade Mountain Homeowner's Association, 
told the Associated Press that there have only been minor crimes in 
recent years, including drugs and break-ins.

'I
believe it was just somebody doing something that required an isolated 
place and it just happened, unfortunately, to be our sub-development,' 
Moore said.

'There are 10 miles of road on 3,000 acres. It's easy to get lost or be invisible once you get past the gate.'

Probe: Officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation investigate the discovery of four bodies in a vehicle at the former Renegade Mountain resort community near Crab Orchard

Grim discovery: The bodies were found by a resident who saw the car parked on the isolated gravel road

The medical examiner's office will conduct autopsies on the bodies.

'I know this really affected a lot of the high school age kids,' said Cumberland County Sheriff Butch Burgess. 'This is something that's very traumatic and it's never happened in our county before, to this extent.'

Cumberland County Superintendent Donald Andrews said grief counselors have been made available at all three area high schools for both students and staff.

Davis had been a sophomore at Cumberland County High School, where he'd been 'well-received' by other students after moving there from another state, Andrews said.

Lajeunesse had attended both Cumberland and Stone Memorial High Schools before being home schooled, Andrews said.
