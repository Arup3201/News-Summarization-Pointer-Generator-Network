George Groves is predicting a third-round knockout of Carl Froch in their mega rematch at Wembley on Saturday week, not another controversial ending to their Battle of Britain for the world super middleweight title.

The 25-year-old Londoner remains supremely confident that he will end the reign of the Nottingham Cobra, so much so that he is in dispute with his own bullish trainer as to how soon he will inflict the stoppage.

Groves said: ‘I can’t see it going longer than three rounds, but Paddy Fitzpatrick thinks Carl will last until the fifth.

Rematch: George Groves claims he will knockout Carl Froch in round three when the two meet again

‘I guess it depends on how Froch approaches it. He may try to take it as long as possible in the false belief that I will blow up in the later rounds.’

Groves was ahead on the scorecard, having floored Froch with a massive right hand in the first round in Manchester last November, before referee Howard Foster declared a hasty stoppage in the champion’s favour in the ninth.

And Groves says: ‘To tell you the truth I was in better physical condition than Carl at that point, even though he did enjoy some success in that round.

‘I had been giving him the beating of his life and he was in more trouble than me.

‘There will be no escape this time. We will have neutral officials (the referee remains a matter of dispute) so I won’t be a victim of the myths that I’m chinny and short on stamina.’

As well as increasing his workrate with Fitzpatrick he has brought in a physical conditioning expert for the first time.

Of his improvement under Barry O’Connell, as well the result of his extended period in camp with Fitzpatrick, he says: ‘Carl thinks I’m not a 12-round fighter but it’s so different in the gym this time. I’m going 15-20 rounds in sparring and it’s effortless. I’ve never done that before but this time, with the same good sparring partners, I’m finding it much easier.’

Although his new promoters, the German giants Sauerland, have no official role for Wembley, Groves is taking their counsel as to who should replace Jack Reiss, the referee who has been vetoed by Froch and his promoter Eddie Hearn.

Controversial: The first fight was ended by referee Howard Foster in the ninth round to much surprise

He suspects that Reiss may be too strict for the taste of the Froch camp, saying: ‘There is some evidence that Carl is being advised by his trainer (Rob McCracken) to rabbit punch. It seemed like it happened in his big fight with Andre Ward. Since the change in the referee we think it’s best to draw attention to that. All I want is a fair neutral.’

Froch does not have a reputation for foul play and the Ward fight in the final of the Super Six super welterweight series remains one of his only two defeats.

Such is Groves' confidence that he insists: ‘Not only am I going to knock Carl out but I would beat every other super middleweight in the world. That includes Ward even though he would be tougher than Froch.’
