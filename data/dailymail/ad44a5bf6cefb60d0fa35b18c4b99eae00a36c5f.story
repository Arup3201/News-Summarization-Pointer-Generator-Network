Vladimir Putin has denied that the Russian economic collapse is punishment for annexing Crimea earlier this year and has vowed to fix the problem in two years at the most.

Delivering his end-of-year speech in Moscow today, a bullish Putin said Russia is becoming 'more and more determined' to protects its interest, and accused the West of trying to put Russia 'in chains'.

He also accepted full responsibility for the country's economic problems, saying he does not shy away from them, instead stating that Russia will recover stronger than ever.

 Vladimir Putin gave an aggressive speech today in which he said the West was trying to put Russia 'in chains', while warning that his is 'more and more determined' to defend the country's interests

Putin used the speech to take a swipe at the West during his end-of-year speech in Moscow today, saying leasers want to put the Russian bear 'in chains' and 'remove its fangs and its claws'

Putin also tried to restore calm to the economy the falling price of oil and gas, along with Western sanctions and investor panic, lead to a currency meltdown two days ago

The Russian leader, who has been on the back foot this week after the tumbling value of Russia's currency caused widespread panic, sought to reassure investors with a blistering speech today.

While the televised address was not short on passion it was short on substance, as the country's currency took another dip in value after two straight days of losses.

He accepted that EU and U.S. sanctions over Crimea were 25 to 30 per cent to blame for the country's economic woes, but said the West did not care about Ukraine and was only using the conflict as an excuse to punish him.

During the three hour address Putin launched a scathing attack on Western leaders, saying they were trying to remove Russia's 'fangs and claws'.

He said: 'Sometimes I think, maybe they'll let the bear eat berries and honey in the forest, maybe they will leave it in peace.

'They will not. Because they will always try to put him on a chain, and as soon as they succeed in doing so they tear out his fangs and his claws. 

'Once they've taken out his claws and his fangs, then the bear is no longer necessary. He'll become a stuffed animal. 

A defiant Putin hit back today, saying sanctions were only 25 to 30 per cent to blame for the crash, and adding that it will take two years to fix the issue 'at most'

Speaking in Moscow Putin also hit out at Western leaders, saying they did not care about Ukraine, but had used the situation there as a way to punish Russia

Speaking with real emotion Putin said that the West sought to put the Russian bear 'in a chain' in order to 'rip out its fangs and claws' - referring to the country's nuclear weapons

'The issue is not Crimea, the issue is that we are protecting our sovereignty and our right to exist.' 

He blamed the current Eastern European crisis on President Yanukovich, the former Ukrainian Prime Minister who was forced to flee the country, saying he was reluctant to use force. 

Speaking against the backdrop of videos showing him meeting cosmonauts, Sochi athletes, and petting a baby tiger, he denied that Russia had invaded, saying he has not invaded anyone.

He added: 'Whatever Russia does, it is always met with criticism.' 

Outside the venue a group of activists gathered, lead by journalist Yevgeny Levkovich, and tried to break in to ask Putin 'some awkward questions.'

Around 20 were taken away by police, while inside Putin continued undisturbed, accused the West of bullying Russia by denying its artists the chance to perform in Western cities.

He claimed that this was unfair, because 'nobody inside Russia is being bullied for supporting Ukraine.'

Despite his aggressive tone he repeated his claims that Russia is looking for a peaceful solution in Ukraine, saying it should remain one state, but must respect all its regions if it is to have peace.

The Russian rouble lost 20 per cent of its value on Tuesday, slipping to an historic low of 80 to one dollar, causing Apple to suspend online sales and panic buying in the shops 

He also said the government in Kiev of building 'a wall' against the country's east, saying it was harming relations there. 

The Russian President, who is facing the largest crisis of his leadership after the rouble lost almost 20 per cent of its value on Tuesday, said the collapse could be over sooner if external factors improve. 

Putin said: 'Our economy will overcome the current situation. How much time will be needed for that? Under the most unfavorable circumstances I think it will take about two years.' 

EU leaders have urged Putin to make a 'radical change' over Ukraine today as they plotted a 'tough and responsible' policy on Russia this evening.

European Council president Donald Tusk said: 'We should send a strong signal on our readiness to further support Ukraine, also financially, as we have done politically today by making the existing sanctions on Crimea and Sebastopol more effective.'

Earlier in the day officials banned investment in Crimea and said cruise ships will not stop at its ports as part of the latest round of sanctions against Russia's 'illegal annexation'.

Under the new restrictions, European Union companies will not be allowed to buy real estate in Crimea, finance local companies or supply related services.

Tourism services are also banned, with cruise ships barred from Crimea ports, except in an emergency.

Russia annexed Crimea earlier this year after holding a referendum which was widely seen as corrupt after weeks of unrest.

It has been a tough 48 hours for Putin, after moves by the Russian Central Bank to shore up the country's economy caused panic among investors, leading to the currency losing 20 per cent of its value two days ago.

Since then Apple has suspended online sales in Russia, saying it cannot set prices while the currency is so volatile, while Ikea and other large stores warned of large price rises, causing panic buying.

At one point on Tuesday the rouble hit an all-time low of 80 to the dollar, and while the currency has since climbed back to 61, it is still below the historic low of 60.

Putin praised the Russian Central Bank for its work in managing the market, although he said some of their decisions were made too late.

The bank's decision to raise interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 17 per cent on Tuesday helped to spark the panic. 

He added that more needs to be done to diversify Russia's economy, which is largely reliant on oil and gas.

Looking to the future he added that Russia will spare 'no expense' when it comes to putting on the 2018 World Cup. 

Speaking in Moscow, Putin said the nation's currency reserves are sufficient to keep the economy stable, saying Russia shouldn't aimlessly 'burn' its reserves, currently standing at $419 billion.

The government also needs to work with exporters to encourage them not to stash their hard currency earnings, to help the ruble stabilise, he said. 

Among the less conventional moves Putin is using to bring stability to the economy is to release tycoons such as Vladimir Yevtushenkov from prison.

Mr Yevtushenkov arrest in September for money laundering spooked markets, causing a brief tumble, and his release today sent shares in his company Sistema surging by 30 per cent.

Putin admitted some decision by the Russian Central Bank were made too late. The move to hike interest rates two days ago sparked the current crisis after it caused investors to panic
