Recent warnings that alcoholic drinks are high in sugar were depressing for those fond of a tipple.

With four teaspoons of sugar in a pint of bitter and two-and-a-half in a glass of prosecco, experts say drinking can dramatically up your sugar consumption – the detrimental effects of which have lately been compared to tobacco.

Doctors now agree that reducing sugar intake  is key to good health and losing weight, and last month the UN’s World Health Organisation slashed the daily recommended amount by half to about six level teaspoons of added sugar a day.

Experts are advising people watching their weight and sugar intake to cut down on all alcohol.

‘It’s important people realise alcohol is a major source of calories and sugar,’ says Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London, and chairman of Action on Sugar.

‘While a glass of red or white wine is a nice accompaniment to a meal, it means extra calories.’

But is cutting out alcohol a realistic goal – or even really necessary?  With such a broad spectrum of sugar content, from only a trace in gin and rum to 10g in a pint of premium lager, clearly not all drinks are detrimental to your waistline.

‘It’s hard to avoid sugar when you drink but  you can limit the damage by being careful,’ says nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch (well-well-well.co.uk).

'Spirits and red and dry white wine have far less sugar than beer or lager, so your choice of tipple makes a difference.’

However, it’s important to remember that per millilitre, spirts are still the highest in calories as alcohol contains more calories than sugar – and high alcohol consumption carries severe health risks.

‘I encourage clients to swap to a single shot of vodka with a slimline mixer.

'That avoids the peer pressure (and self-denial) of not drinking, yet you’ll consume up to four teaspoons less sugar than from a large glass of wine or beer.’

 We set out to investigate whether you could change your health (and weight) by changing what you drink. We asked two couples to swap their drinking preferences for a month.

Each couple drank two to three units of their chosen alcohol four times a week and stuck to their usual dietary and exercise routines.

Jackie then helped explain changes in their weight.

The couples used Tanita body composition monitor scales to measure their weight, fat and visceral fat – the fat around internal organs measured on a scale from 1 to 59: a rating of 13 or over indicates excess levels.
