That social media was super-rich Brooks Newmark’s undoing should come as no surprise: Just two years ago he became the first MP to be sacked for his obsession with tweeting.

He lost his job as a Tory Whip after posting a stream of showbusiness-themed messages – including whether he should watch Downton Abbey or Spooks.

One said: ‘I went to see Bridesmaids last night – guys it may be a chick flick but it was hysterically funny!’

But within a few weeks of being restored to Government office in July as Charities Minister, the warning signs were there again as his maverick streak got the better of him.

Brooks Newmark (pictured) with his wife Lucy in 2005 lost his job as a Tory Whip two years ago after posting a stream of showbusiness-themed messages – including whether he should watch Downton Abbey or Spooks

In his first speech as minister he was accused of insulting charitable organisations by telling them to keep their noses out of politics and ‘stick to knitting’.

He said: ‘We really want to try and keep charities and voluntary groups out of the realms of politics. When they stray into the realm of politics that is not what they are about and that is not why people give them money.

‘The important thing charities should be doing is sticking to their knitting – they should be about helping others.’

He later said he was referring to party politics.

Born in Westport, Connecticut, but brought up from the age of nine in the UK, Newmark, 56, cuts an exotic figure at Westminster with his mid-Atlantic accent and fondness for travelling to dangerous places.

He made a fortune in banking and is a personal friend of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The two have frequently discussed the Middle East.

He has been a strong supporter of tough military action in Syria and met Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad several times up until 2011, when the current crisis there began. 

Last year, he travelled to meet Syrian rebel leaders before condemning Labour for blocking military action by the UK against al-Assad for using chemical weapons.

Educated at Harvard and Oxford, Newmark was vice-president of the international division of Shearson Lehman Brothers and worked for an private equity firm. He entered the Commons in 2005 as MP for Braintree.

He lives in a £15 million home in Belgravia, London, with his wife Lucy – daughter of distinguished historian Sir John Keegan. The couple have five children.
