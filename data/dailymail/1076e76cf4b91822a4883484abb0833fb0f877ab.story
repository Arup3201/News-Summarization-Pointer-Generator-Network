Despite stagnant wages and a slow crawl out of the recession, sales of premium food and drink are soaring as customers increasingly indulge in high-end artisan breads, fine wines and expensive cheeses.

New figures show the sales growth of many products once considered a rare treat is now outstripping that of the standard, and much more affordable, alternatives.

Retailers and producers claim the boost in sales shows many people, particularly those with a limited disposable income, are happy to spend a little bit extra to indulge in a small guilty pleasure.

New Waitrose sales figures show a soaring growth in sales of luxury bread, champagne and goats' cheese compared to last year

Waitrose's sales figures show remarkable growth compared to last year for handmade and high-end breads and wines.

Sales of handmade artisan bread have risen by 31 per cent compared with 2013, while champagne is up 7 per cent.

Waitrose white sourdough has also seen sales increase by 12 per cent.

But the product to register the biggest growth in popularity is goats' milk Gouda - with sales of the Dutch cheese soaring by a staggering 34 per cent on last year.

Sam Dickson, Head of Brand and Product Development at Waitrose said there was 'no doubt' premium ranges were proving popular and that they added an' indulgent treat' to customers' shopping.

'A fine bottle of wine or a specialty loaf is now a regular appearance at dinner, proving that quality produce still very much matters.'

But Waitrose - which is often lambasted as a supermarket for the affluent - is not the only company to register a growth in high-end products.

Waitrose bosses said the sales showed high-end food remained an 'indulgent treat' for customers

Last Christmas the Hebridean Smokehouse, a Scottish business that supplies locally smoked salmon, sea trout and shellfish, required an extra Royal Mail plane to deliver its postal orders,The Times reported.

And Bronwen Percival, a buyer for cheese-selling business Neal's Yard Dairy, told the paper: 'We have been consistently feeling good about the potential for growth of artisan cheese sales throughout the recession.

'What we find is that people who are into really good cheese continue to buy it.

'It is something that people can continue to enjoy even when they don't have a huge amount of disposable income.'Â
