A gay teen in South Dakota says he quit his job at fast-food chain Taco John's after a manager forced him to wear a name tag reading 'Gaytard' - and now he's looking into legal action.

However, the Yanktown franchise's manager disputes 16-year-old Tyler Brandt's claims, saying he came up with the name-tag nickname himself.

The alleged incident took place Monday night, when Brandt says his 'agitated' and 'verbally abusive' manager pulled him into the office and gave him the name tag with 'Gaytard' on it while laughing.

That's not my name: 16-year-old Tyler Brandt says he was forced to wear this name tag at his fast-food job in Yanktown, South Dakota

Brandt had been struggling to learn the new job and was afraid to getting fired, so he agreed to wear the name tag.

'I put it on because I didn't want to upset him and I felt that if I did do anything to upset him, it would cause me to lose my job because he'd be looking for ways to fire me,' Brant told Keloland.

He says he spent the night standing behind the till so customers wouldn't see the homophobic slur on his name tag, but Brandt says his manager continued to call him by the name across the store.

Brandt tried taking off the tag several times, but his manager kept telling him to put it back on.

By 11:30pm, Brandt was so frustrated that he asked how long was left in the shift, at which point the manager yelled and him and told him to 'Get the f*** out' of the restaurant.

After talking about the situation with his boyfriend and other friends, Brandt decided to resign the next morning.

He went into the restaurant to return his uniform but kept the name tag as evidence.

However, restaurant manager John Scott says he didn't force Brandt to wear the name tag, and didn't come up with the nickname.

'He asked the manager to make that name tag for him,' Scott told the Press & Dakotan. 'He (the manager) didn't tell him he had to wear it. (Brandt) put it on himself and created the situation.'

But Brandt says that idea is offensive.

'Do you really think I'd want to go around making a mockery of who I am?' It's really irritating to think someone could believe I would want that label.'

Taco John's CEO Jeff Linville has since issued a statement, saying the company believes everyone 'should be treated with dignity and respect.'

'We take any accusation of workplace harassment very seriously. The type of discrimination that reportedly took place recently in the Yankton, South Dakota restaurant is deplorable. Such actions will not be tolerated by our company. Taco Johnâ€™s is committed to doing all we can to make certain nothing like this happens again in any of our restaurants.

Now both Scott and Brandt are exploring legal action against each other.

'I don't think that any person has to put up with what has been going on. I don't think that anybody should have to put up with any kind of discrimination. It's not fair,' Brandt said.
