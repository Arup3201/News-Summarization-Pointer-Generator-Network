Heather Watson knows victory against world No 7 Angelique Kerber today would be the biggest win of her career, but the British No1 refuses to even contemplate the possibility of defeat.

Watson was so nervous before her first-round win against Ajla Tomljanovic on Tuesday that she suffered a sleepless night, and then her jaw locked when she tried to eat a banana.

But she insisted her worries had eased after clearing ‘the first hurdle’ in SW19.

Prepared: Heather Watson says she is ready for the biggest match of her career against Angelique Kerber

Defeated: Watson played with Eugenie Bouchard in the doubles on Wednesday, but the pair lost out

The 22-year-old had only seven hours’ sleep and woke at 6.30am before losing with partner Eugenie Bouchard in the doubles yesterday 6-4, 7-6 to Australian pair Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacque, but insisted she feels in ‘great shape’ and is ready to cause an upset today.

Watson added: ‘I enjoy every match but I enjoy winning them more than anything. It’s one of my favourite feelings in life.

‘I don’t think about the expectation at all. I’m not even worried what anyone else thinks.

‘I just love the game and everything that comes with it. I think being more aggressive is the only way forward.

‘I think you should go out and try to win the point instead of just hoping.’

Tough ask: Kerber will be the big favourite for the third round match

Asked if victory over Kerber would represent the biggest of her career, she replied: ‘It would be, on paper. To be in the third round again would be awesome.

‘I don’t even want to think about losing. That won’t be a thought that will go through my mind.

‘She (Kerber) might be better on paper but, especially in the women’s game, it’s very open.

‘The seeds get knocked out early on sometimes. It happens.’
