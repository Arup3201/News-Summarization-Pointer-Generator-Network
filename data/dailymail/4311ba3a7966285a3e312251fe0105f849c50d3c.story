A university student suffered a drug-related death while his girlfriend allegedly kept vital information from paramedics trying to save his life.

Amanda Denke, 19, of Wilton, Connecticut, waited to call for help when her boyfriend Pawel Sywak, 20, stopped breathing last month, police said.

The former University of Connecticut student was charged on Thursday after allegedly hiding drugs and lying to police about what happened.

Engineering student Mr Sywak stopped breathing in Mansfield Apartments on January 24 but Denke did not immediately call for help, police said.

She allegedly chose to hide away various drugs in a bedroom instead of calling emergency services in an attempt to avoid getting caught out.

When paramedics arrived Denke allegedly withheld important medical details after she had hidden the drugs, reported NBC Connecticut.

Denke lied to officers twice about what happened and was found to have heroin, marijuana and two smoke pipes at the scene, police said.

There were 24 wax fold bags of heroin
at the flat and she had three bags in her purse, police said. Mr Sywak 
died two days later at Hartford Hospital.

Denke was handed a host of charges 
including reckless endangerment, possession of heroin and marijuana and 
tampering with evidence.

The
teen, who has since dropped out of UConn, was also charged with making 
false statements to police and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Denke
posted $50,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned in Rockville 
Superior Court in Rockville, Connecticut, on February 28.

Mr Sywakâ€™s cause of death has not yet been released. Both Mr Sywak and Denke were arrested last year separately on drugs-related charges.

Mr Sywak was originally from Poland but had lived in the U.S. for 17 years. He was big fan of the UConn basketball team and the Polish football team.

His mother Monika told the UConn Daily Campus that he wanted to work as an engineer in the military and leaves behind his ten-year-old brother Alex.

'He had a great personality and he was a great friend,' his friend and fellow UConn student Gabe Quieros told the Daily Campus.
