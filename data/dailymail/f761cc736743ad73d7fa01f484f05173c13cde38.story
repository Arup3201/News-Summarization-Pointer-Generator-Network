The most exciting all-round talent in English and perhaps world women’s cricket was born in Tokyo and played football in a Polish youth league before finally taking up the game that would make her name.

That most cosmopolitan of upbringings was the result of her mother working for the foreign office. But Nat Sciver is very much a product of Surrey, Loughborough University and an ever expanding English set-up.

Now she is at the forefront of a group of young players, which includes Kate Cross and Tash Farrant, who will carry the flag for a professional England team as they attempt to establish cricket as the No 1 choice for elite sportswomen.

Charlotte Edwards, England’s long-serving and outstanding captain, is still the face of women’s cricket. But it is the new breed who will determine the long-term profile of the English game, not least the engaging Sciver.

Sciver, 22, is a batting all-rounder good enough as a seam bowler to take a hat-trick in a Twenty20 international against New Zealand.

Crucially, she is as powerful a striker of a ball as any woman in world cricket.

Significant investment in the women’s game has seen the England team make great strides, but one of the biggest criticisms of them has been their lack of real strength, a failing summed up by their inability to regularly clear the ropes.

That is where Sciver comes in. When she played tennis she struggled to keep the ball in play and when she plays golf she regularly drives the ball as far as most men. Most importantly, she can give a cricket ball a real whack.

‘I’d like to think I’m the biggest hitter around,’ said Sciver coyly during one of England’s regular training sessions at Loughborough.

‘We’ve put quite a bit of emphasis on powerful striking, not necessarily hitting sixes, but everyone has been working hard on the technique of that.

‘It’s one of my strengths which I want to use in a game more often.

‘When I played tennis I couldn’t keep the ball in the court but luckily there are no restrictions in cricket. I guess I’m naturally strong.’

Strength is what England need. They have led the way in many of the improvements in the women’s game but their lack of collective power was summed up by the fact that they did not hit a single six between them in the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in March and April. ‘The game is moving forward so quickly that this was always something we’d need to work on,’ said Sciver. ‘You can’t stand still.

‘Women’s cricket is getting more and more competitive and we have to keep up.

‘We’ve taken a bit of baseball, both the technique and using the whole body, and it’s something we’ve been working on for a few months.

‘It’s hard to tell how far I can hit it now because I’ve only got the hall at Loughborough to go by but it’s something I want and need to take into games.’

It has been quite a journey for Sciver to where we are now, at the ECB Performance Centre at Loughborough where she has studied for the last three-and-a-half years and now shares a house with four other England cricketers.

She spent the first two years of her life in Japan before a brief return to England and then a prolonged spell in Europe which saw her family based in Holland as well as Poland. Sciver played football competitively and tried her hand at other sports before settling on cricket when returning home for good at 14.

‘It has been brilliant,’ she says of her cricketing conversion.

‘My dad played at school and university and every summer after he left Cambridge he would have this weekend where he would get back together with his mates and play.

Next on the agenda for Sciver is a tour of New Zealand, while another Ashes series awaits England’s women

‘I used to go along with him and join in but they didn’t like it when a girl got them out!

‘So I started properly at Stoke D’Abernon because it was the only club with a women’s section near where I lived and I was lucky enough to have a Surrey coach. I was put forward for a trial and I went through the county system.’

She made her England debut just 18 months ago but has already become a key performer in all formats, while cricket became her career in May when the ECB took the momentous step of making the elite players full-time.

Next on the agenda for Sciver is February’s tour of New Zealand, while another Ashes series awaits England’s women as well as men this summer.

‘Professional contracts have been a huge step not just for women’s cricket but women’s sport,’ said Sciver. ‘We’re standing on our own two feet which is really nice and there’s more and more development through the pathways and grass-roots. It’s growing all the time and it’s a really exciting time to be involved.

As well as working on her hitting, Sciver wants to get faster with the ball - closer to the 75mph mark

‘It has made everyone a bit more competitive and the battle for places is brilliant. You have more time to work on the game rather than having to work, too. I’ve got six months left on my studies [she is doing a sports and exercise studies degree] and have been balancing cricket and uni for a while now. Loughborough have been very accommodating and I’ve sat exams in Bangladesh and Australia among other places.’

As well as working on her hitting, Sciver wants to get faster with the ball and hopes to move towards the sort of speeds, 75 miles per hour plus, that have made her house-mate, Katherine Brunt, England’s fastest bowler.

‘I’ve been playing in the England set up for a year-and-a-half now and hopefully this isn’t it yet,’ she said.

‘It has gone pretty well. I haven’t had a down spell yet but, touch wood, the only way is up.’

She is certainly one to watch.
