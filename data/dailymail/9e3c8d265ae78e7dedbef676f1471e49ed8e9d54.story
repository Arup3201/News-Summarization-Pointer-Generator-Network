It might not be many people's idea of a place to call home.

But the pub where Adolf Hitler was born in the Austrian town of Branau-am-Inn could now be turned into flats after developers submitted plans to the local council.

The mayor of Braunau, Hannes Waidbacher, who opposes  alternative proposals for a Holocaust museum at the site, believes turning the Gasthaus zum Pommer into family homes would be one way of 'destigmatising' the town.

Plans: Developers want to turn the former Gasthaus zum Pommer where Hitler was born (pictured) into apartments

As it was: Pictured in 1966, the building had been, variously, a girl's school and a public library, after World War II. Most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people

Nationality: Hitler's birthplace is just a short distance from the German border. The Nazi leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the 'Anschluss' in 1938

If the plan- approved by the mayor and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean the room where Hitler was born would become a bedroom in self-contained apartments with state-of-the-art kitchens and bathrooms.

The apartments would go on the market for an estimated 400,000 pounds each.

Such a plan, say experts, would require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single flat - or indeed the entire property - did not fall into the hands of neo-Nazis masking their real identities.

The little Austrian town separated from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future Fuhrer was born on April 20 1889.

It was until recently used as a workshop for the mentally and physically disabled; the sort of people Hitler deemed as 'useless eaters' and the first to die in the Third Reich's secret euthanasia campaign before WWII.

But it has been empty for a year now with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging about what to do with the two-storey listed building.

Mayor Waidbacher said: 'Braunau has done much to process its history over the years.

'It is not necessary to build a Holocaust museum in the house as some have suggested.

'Braunau as a town is already stigmatised enough.

'Hitler spent only three years of his life here, and they were certainly not the most formative years of his life.

'Why should I or others take responsibility for him? I was born 21 years after the end of the war.'

The mayor said he was open to all suggestions, saying Braunau wants an 'affordable solution for all.'

'I can imagine all possibilities for the house,' he said.

Marker: A memorial stone (pictured) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history. In English the inscription reads 'For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Remind [us]'

Past: Mayor Hannes Waidbacher supports the plan for apartments - saying it would help 'de-stigmatise' the town

However, Mayor Waidbacjer is against turning the building into a 'House of Peace' or a 'House of Responsibility' as Green Party members have advocated - believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most infamous son.

Already the newspapers in Austria and Germany are having a field day at the prospect of flats in Hitler's house.

'In the future you can live like Adolf Hitler,' said the Austrian newspaper Heute while the salzburger Nachrichten said; 'Hitler's home to become apartment block.'

The house at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 is estimated to be worth about £2.5 million to £3 million.

It was in a room on the first floor of the three-storey, 2,000 square foot premises that Hitler’s mother Klara gave birth to the future Nazi leader.

She and her husband Alois, a stern local customs official, rented a suite of rooms above the pub and continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to Linz.

Alois, a drunkard, often availed himself of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife who was 24 years his junior.

The house is still owned by the family after which the pub took its name.

Owner Gelinde Pommer says she wants to sell because she no longer wants to have responsibility for it.

Nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with Hitler, not even the bedroom where he was born.

The only Nazi-era relic is on an iron gate outside, the initials MB for Hitler’s party secretary Martin Bormann, who had them placed there when he declared the house a national monument after Hitler took over Austria in 1938.

During the 12 year lifespan of the Third Reich it was a must-see place of pilgrimage for loyal Nazis.

Bormann bought the house with Nazi funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed Nazi-approved art.

It was given back to the Pommer family in 1952 and served as the town’s public library until 1965 before becoming, in turns, a school, a bank, a technical institute and finally the home and workshop for disabled people.

Those who want it turned into a site of remembrance for Hitler's crimes are pressing central government in Vienna to compulsorily purchase the property.
