Middle school students in Oregon will now have access to condoms after a spike in local pregnancies prompted administrators to revisit their sexual education policies.

The Gervais School District has passed a rule that will specify certain teachers to hand out condoms to students when the students ask for them.

'If they wanted a condom, they would have to meet with a teacher- a designated teacher, the sex ed teacher, or some of our counselors and maybe some administrators,' the local superintendent Rick Hansel told CBS.

Spike in pregnancies: The new rule comes after 7 per cent of the young girls at Gervais High School became pregnant over the course of the last academic year

'There would be designated people for students to have a conversation with and then a condom would be distributed at that time.'Â 

School administrators feel that by forcing the students to talk to a teacher about the issue in order to get the condoms will help as opposed to just leaving the condoms somewhere out in the open for students to take without any supervision.

Addressing the issue: Superintendent Rick Hensel said that the policy will force students to speak to teachers before getting the condoms

The new rule comes after 7 per cent of the young girls at Gervais High School became pregnant over the course of the last academic year.

That number has dropped slightly this year to 5 per cent- which equate to nine girls between sixth and 12th grade- even though the policy will not go into effect until next year.

In the Gervais school district south of Portland, the high school and middle school are run separately, but that didn't stop the administrators from extending the new rule to both.

'I think the concern was that if we have our middle school, we have some of the same teachers teaching the same topics at the high school, obviously there's going to be a different type of curriculum for the middle school, but at some point they just kind of felt it would evolve to that anyway- so let's just include them (sixth graders),' Mr Hansel told CBS.

He also noted that the middle school is only 40 feet away from the high school.

Parents are split on the issue, with some board members- who voted to approve the rule- noting that it will lead to more constructive conversations about sex while others think that it is unnecessary to make it available to children at such a young age
