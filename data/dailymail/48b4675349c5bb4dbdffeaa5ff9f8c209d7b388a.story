Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone only found out his daughter’s wedding had cost him more than £12million after the big day – because his ex-wife settled the bill and didn’t tell him.

The extraordinarily high price tag for the ceremony was revealed for the first time yesterday in a German court case. It had previously been thought to have cost around £5million.

Ecclestone’s youngest daughter Petra, 22, married businessman James Stunt in August at a medieval castle in the Italian town of Bracciano.

The lavish celebration included stunning fireworks displays, acrobats performing beneath hot air balloons, £4,000 bottles of Chateau Petrus claret and a private show by chart-topping band The Black Eyed Peas.

Petra’s Vera Wang wedding dress cost £80,000 and the service was accompanied by 18 members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, who had been flown in for the occasion. Accompanying them was the 20-member Tenebrae Choir, described as ‘one of the greatest choirs in the world’.

More than 250 VIPs attended and they were kept cool in air-conditioned flower-filled canopies in the castle grounds.

Giving evidence for a second day at the fraud trial of a German banker, Ecclestone told the court: ‘Let me tell you something. When my youngest daughter said she was getting married I thought as father of the bride I should pay for the wedding.

Secret payments: Ecclestone admitted his lawyer in Switzerland acted as 'moneyman' when he paid £27million in blackmail cash to banker Gerhard Gribkowsky

‘When it was suggested how much they would be spending on drinks I thought it was absurd. So I managed to upset my daughter and my wife.

‘Only later did I learn that it cost in excess of £12million which I did not find out about until later, paid by my wife, and I did not find out from her.’

Happier times: Ecclestone and ex-wife Slavica, whose trust half of the cash came from

In another startling revelation, the Munich court also heard the 81-year-old motor racing tycoon confess to having a ‘girlfriend’ during his 24-year marriage to wife Slavica. In court he constantly referred to Slavica, 53, as his wife, despite their divorce in 2009.

He said the banker, Gerhard Gribkowsky, became a ‘drinking pal’ of Slavica and told how they once met in a mobile home at a race meeting where Slavica tried to extract information about her husband’s girlfriends.

‘Were there girlfriends then?’ asked the prosecutor. ‘Well, one girlfriend,’ replied Ecclestone before the questioning moved on.

The Formula One boss is the star witness in the case against Gribkowsky, who is accused of corruption and tax evasion and who Ecclestone says blackmailed him out of £27million in 2006.

The tycoon has not been charged with any offence but his admission that he paid out the vast sum  puts him at the centre of the corruption case.

Prosecutors refused to believe that the tycoon had never discussed the ‘shakedown’ payment with his then wife, and Ecclestone used the story about the wedding bill to illustrate how he and Slavica kept business and personal spending separate. ‘I never brought my business problems home to my wife,’ he said.

Gribkowsky, who was the chief risks officer for the BayernLB bank in Munich, handled the £500million sale of 47 percent of Formula One rights from the bank to London-based private equity group CVC.

He was charged with fraud after he was found to have £27million in a bank account after the deal was completed. He denies all charges.

Headache: Ecclestone, left, said he paid Gribkowsky, right, the cash to 
make sure the 'starstruck' banker did not cause him problems with the 
taxman

No expense spared: Petra's wedding featured a performance by the Black Eyed Peas and guests were served £4,000 bottles of Chateau Petrus claret

Ecclestone said he paid the cash to the banker because he feared he would ‘make me liable for a £2billion tax bill’.

The tycoon said he believed Gribkowsky had become starstruck by the world of Formula One and  wanted to become his business partner.

When he spurned his offers, Ecclestone claimed Gribkowsky began making noises about going to the Inland Revenue.

‘He would have landed me with a lengthy investigation, massive legal costs and I didn’t need it and so I paid to get rid of the problem,’ he said.

After the hearing Ecclestone boarded a private jet to Abu Dhabi for this weekend’s grand prix.

The case continues.
