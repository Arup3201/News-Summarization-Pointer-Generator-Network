It didn't end up quite as badly as the Ferrari in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but a California valet has lost his job this week after being caught taking a brand new Corvette out for a spin - and pushing the car to 50 mph in seconds.

Dan Cowles, the owner of the 2015 Chevrolet - which are priced between $60,000 and $70,000 -  dropped his car off at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa on Sunday as he took his wife to see a concert.

The attendant who gets in the vehicle decides to take a joy ride around the garage before parking, however Cowles had cleverly activated a new feature called 'Valet Mode'.

The new C7 model is equipped with a Performance Data Recorder (PDR), which is a built-in video camera that records everything from speed to gear changes and revs.

Revving up: A valet at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa was caught on a dash cam taking a new 2015 Corvette Stingray for a joy ride once the owner got out of the car

That's fast: At one point in the video, the attendant gets the car up to a dangerous 50 mph

Sprung: If the valet hadn't walked in front of the vehicle, he may not have been caught. And then fired

Valet Mode records the car when it is in drive from the time the setting is activated to when it is turned off, so owner can see exactly where their car has gone, or have proof if an attendant were to hit something and cause damage.

Cowles car was not dented, but the PDR camera captured alot more than he imagined.

At one point, in a quiet section of the parking garage, the valet takes the car up to 50 mph.

Then, once parking it, about a minute and a half after getting in the car, he steps in front of the Corvette, presumably to ensure he didn't hit the retaining wall in front.

The move meant he was captured by the dash cam, effectively identifying himself.

'When he parked the car into the stall, he went out of the car and looked at the front end of the car … I was concerned about damage about the front of the car, but fortunately there was no damage,' Cowles told ABC News.

'You hear stories about valet, you see things in the past and you hope that's an exception and not the norm.'

Sleek: The 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray was unveiled in February and costs between $60,000-$70,000

Clever: Valet Mode records the car when it is in drive from the time the setting is activated to when it is turned off, so owner can see exactly where their car has gone

However, Cowles had further problems when reporting what he discovered to the owner of the valet company.

'The owner called me up yesterday, the first thing he said he spoke to his attorney and told me the video was illegal," Cowles said. 

"I think my impression was the owner didn’t realize the video was built into the car. 

'I informed him this was standard of Corvettes and that as long as audio isn’t recorded in California it’s not illegal.'

The owner informed Cowles the valet had been fired for inappropriate behavior.

The story has parallels to the pinnacle point of 1986 comedy favorite Ferris Bueller's Day Off starring  Matthew Broderick.

Brat pack: In the 1986 blockbuster comedy, directed by John Hughs, Ferris Bueller takes a rare red Ferrari out for a spin - even though it belonged to his friend's father

Classic: The film finishes with the prized Ferrari ending up in a ravine

In the film, Ferris Bueller convinces his friend Cameron to ‘borrow’ his father’s vintage 1962 Ferrari GT California.

Director John Hughs said in interviews at the time that there were only 100 of those cars ever produced.

In the movie, Cameron is fearful of his father’s retribution after he discovers that they’ve put a few hundred miles on the car’s odometer.

In an effort to ‘undo’ the mileage, Bueller suggests that they run the car in reverse. 

However Cameron kicks the car out of anger, sending it plummeting into a ravine.
