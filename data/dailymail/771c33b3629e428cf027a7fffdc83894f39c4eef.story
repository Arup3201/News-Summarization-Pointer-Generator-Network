This is the dramatic moment firefighters abseiled down a cliff in the dark to rescue a girl who had plunged 40ft over the rocky ledge.

The teenager, who has not yet been named, was badly injured when she fell over the edge at Rocky Butte park in Portland, Oregon.

It is unclear why she fell - but authorities say that her injuries are life-threatening and that she is still in hospital.

Portland Fire and Rescue says a girl in her early teens sustained life-threatening injuries when she fell more than 40 feet off the cliffs at a popular hiking and climbing spot.

Crews from Portland Fire and Rescue arrived minutes after receiving reports on Friday evening saying the girl had gone over the edge.

Initially, firefighters weren't sure where the teen was located, according to Firefighter Gabriel Watson.

Firefighters started searching with powerful lights from the top of the cliffs, while others looked at the bottom, and eventually spotted her moving down below and set up a high-angle rope rescue system.

'Upon reaching the patient, firefighters performed a rapid evaluation and determined the need for urgent evacuation,' Watson said, according to KOIN 6. 

'The firefighters then immediately began treating the woman’s many injuries,' she added.

Officials said that after treating the girl, they carried her in a litter one-third of a mile to an ambulance, which transported her to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center.

Watson said it remains unknown what caused the girl to fall. 

The hospital said Saturday that it could give no information about her condition without the name.

'Hikers should stick to established pathways, follow posted signage and steer away cliffs or unknown areas–especially during the evening when visibility is limited,' Watson advised.
