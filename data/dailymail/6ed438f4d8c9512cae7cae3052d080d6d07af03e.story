Two young children and one adult are dead after two school buses filled with students smashed into each other this afternoon.

The buses were left mangled, and one had overturned, after the horrific crash on a highway in Knoxville, Tennessee.

The two child victims, who have not been named, are no older than the third grade and could be as young as kindergartners.

Also killed in the crash was an aide on the bus.

One of the vehicles had been driving passengers from Chilhowee Intermediate School and the other had pupils from Sunnyview Primary School on board, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported.

The buses collided on Asheville Highway in Knoxville at 2.50pm Tuesday. Details of the collision were not clear.

Footage of the aftermath showed the bus from Sunnview, number 44, with most of its front caved in, while the Chilhowee bus, number 57, had overturned and had a large dent in one side.

As well as the three fatalities, 20 other children were injured and taken to East Tennessee Children's Hospital. Eighteen were from Sunnview and two from Chilhowee.

None of the injuries were serious and all 20 were discharged by Tuesday evening.

Local news station WBIR reported that a further three people - whose ages were not specified - were taken to the University of Tennessee Medical Center with 'minor to serious' injuries. 

According to local media reports, distraught relatives raced to the scene of the crash, where at least one family learned their child had died from an officer at the scene.

Students who were uninjured were in the process of being reunited with their parents Tuesday evening. Authorities cancelled school at both institutions for Wednesday.

The two buses, with serial numbers 57 and 44, were operated by separate contractors. The school district said neither company had been problematic before.

Victims: Students who were aboard the buses wait with a firefighter to be picked up from the scene

Distraught: Counselors and school officials arrived at the scene of the crash this afternoon

An auto shop manager near the scene told how he heard a 'big bang' when the buses collided.

Karla Corona said: 'I heard the big bang... we saw that a bus had flipped over and another was in the middle of the road.

'I saw people running toward the bus. I saw all the kids being rushed off the bus. Firefighters were the first to show up, and two or three cop cars. People actually got out of their cars and ran to help.

The highway where the crash took place was closed, and is expected to remain so for several hours.
