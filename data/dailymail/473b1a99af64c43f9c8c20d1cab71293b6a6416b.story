Former Eastenders actor Jody Latham will face a trial by jury over claims he grew a £15,000 cannabis farm.

The 30-year-old actor, who played evil pimp Rob Grayson in the BBC soap, and his girlfriend Sarah Melia, 31, were charged with cultivating cannabis after 24 plants were found behind a false wall inside a garage at his house in Bacup, Lancs.

During a hearing at Burnley Magistrates Court today the case was moved to Burnley Crown Court, where the pair will face trial in October.

Both Latham and Melia face up to 14 years in jail if convicted.

Police were acting on a tip when they swooped on the
property in May last year and uncovered the secret stash of drugs.

In court today neither Latham nor Melia entered a plea and both stood with their arms crossed in the dock as the charge was put to them.

Defence lawyer Ben Leech told the court Latham and Melia disputed details of the charged levelled against them.

He said: 'There are a number of things that will be challenged. The yield is not accepted and the value is not accepted.'

The case was then adjourned until October 10.

The actor’s career took off at the age of 12 when his talent was spotted during performances at Burley Youth Theatre.

Latham then found fame playing Phillip ‘Lip’ Gallagher in Channel 4 drama Shameless from 2004 to 2008, before landing the role of Grayson in EastEnders last year.

He has also starred in ITV’s The Fixer and had a stint as a trainee chef in Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen, but revealed he was facing bankruptcy earlier this year.
