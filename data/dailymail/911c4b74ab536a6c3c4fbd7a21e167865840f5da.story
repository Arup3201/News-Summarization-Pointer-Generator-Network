The son of the pilot of ill-fated MH370 has broken his silence and denied Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately crashed the plane into the Indian Ocean.

Ahmad Seth says he has 'ignored all the speculation' around his 53-year-old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur 19 days ago.

The 26-year-old, Captain Zaharie's youngest son, says the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead, insisting they will wait for physical evidence, as searches were today suspended when heavy rain, winds and low clouds forced aircraft to return to base.

The criminal inquiry cleared all the  intelligence checks completed for all the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur. The only individual arousing suspicion was Captian Shah

'I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation,' he told the New Strait Times.

'We may not be as close as he travels so much. But I understand him.

'Now, we are just waiting for the right confirmation. I will believe it when I see the proof in front of my eyes.'

The Times added that Mr Seth was supported at the family home by friends. His mother Khanum Mustafa Khan and siblings Ahmad Idris and Aishah - who lives in Melbourne - have not spoken to media since the plane disappeared.

It comes amid reports that investigators now believe Captain Zaharie is solely responsible for the Malaysian Airline jet's demise and have dismissed the likelihood of mechanical failure or a hijacking.

A high-ranking official told USA Today that Captain Zaharie's family is being scrutinised in the hope of shedding some light on the tragedy.

A friend of the pilot yesterday revealed Captain Zaharie was in 'no state of mind to be flying' and had been left distraught by his wife's decision to move out of the family home.

A friend of the pilot says it is possible Captain Zaharie took MH370 for a 'last joyride', in which he tried high-risk maneuvers he had perfected on his beloved home-made flight simulator

‘He's one of the finest pilots around and I'm no medical expert, but with all that was happening in his life Zaharie was probably in no state of mind to be flying,’ he told the NZ Herald on the condition of anonymity.

He said his friend's relationships were breaking down, adding it was possible Captain Zaharie took MH370 for a 'last joyride' in which he tried high-risk maneuvers he had perfected on his beloved home-made flight simulator.

Aerial sweeps of the southern Indian Ocean for debris were suspended on Thursday as adverse weather conditions forced the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to recall 11 search aircraft to Perth.

But five ships will remain in the 78,000-square-kilometre search area and continue to follow a new lead from French satellite images dated March 23 that showed 122 objects floating in the area more than 2,000 kilometres off Australia's west coast.

An aviation meteorologist told the MailOnline that deteriorating weather was expected to make life difficult for military and civilian search personnel, and warned further delays were expected in the coming days.

Aviation meteorologist Martin Babakhan said a front of warm air was moving into the cold search area, causing a thick, wall-like band of low cloud cover.

'When you have those sorts of front mixing in with the cooler temperatures from the ocean, the result is it creates high-level moisture - or 100 per cent humidity,' he told the MailOnline.

'Visibility is completely restricted for those aircraft out there. When these types of weather conditions occur at Sydney Airport, for example, the plane is switched into auto-pilot and GPS is used to land the plane automatically.

'You just can't do that out there over the ocean - it's a completely different environment. Even trying to fly underneath the cloud cover presents a safety risk, that's why they don't do it.'

Mr Babakhan said the visibility issues would linger for approximately 24 hours before conditions begin to improve. He said AMSA would most likely call the ships back later Thursday as the swell becomes more aggressive in the search area.

'The waves will definitely start to get bigger as a result of the front moving through,' he said. 'We're talking about them ranging from three metres up to seven metres.

'It's very unlikely they will be able to find anything in those conditions until at least Saturday or Sunday.'

The Malaysian Minister of Defence and acting Transport Minister Dato Seri Hishammuddin Hussein shows the pictures of the possible debris of the flight MH370 at a press conference

The location of potential objects related to the search of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 debris was shown by the Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA)

Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein revealed Wednesday that the news satellite images have dramatically narrowed the search zone, with the debris spotted across an area measuring just 155 square miles (400 square kilometres).

Mr Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the images were captured by France-based Airbus Defence and Space on March 23.

They are the fourth set of satellite images to show potential debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in a remote part of the Indian Ocean roughly 2,500 km (1,550 miles) south west of Perth.

The objects are believed to be solid and range from one metre to 23 metres (three to 75 feet) long.
