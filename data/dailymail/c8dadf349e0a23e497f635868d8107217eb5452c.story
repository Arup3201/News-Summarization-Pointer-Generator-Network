Several other pictures that cropped up on Weibo - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - showed smoke filling the air above the crowds making their way through the terminal in the capital.

But state-run China Central Television has said the man survived the blast and was taken to hospital after detonating the bomb.

It said there were no other injuries, that no flights had been affected, and that order had been restored at the airport.

Reached over the phone, the airport's news office said it was not aware
