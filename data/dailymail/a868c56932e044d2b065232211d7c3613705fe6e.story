A four-month-old baby was starved to death by his parents as his mother repeatedly lied about taking him to see doctors, a jury has found.

Amy R. Hockett, 22, was found guilty of murder in the death of Khaiden Hockett, while Joseph L. Pierson, 25, was found guilty of reckless homicide, as he was ruled to be 'mildly mentally retarded'.

Khaiden was found unresponsive inside the couple's filthy, feces-ridden home in Richmond, Indiana on February 5, 2012, weighing just six pounds.

The case was ruled a homicide, with the cause of death cited as dehydration because of starvation.

Guilty: Amy Hockett, left, and Joseph L. Pierson, right, starved their four-month-old son to death as Hockett claimed she was taking the tiny baby to doctors for tests for a range of diseases

His death came despite Hockett claiming doctors were testing her son for diseases including leukemia, blood disorders and kidney stones, and less serious 
problems, such as acid reflux.

Pierson's attorneys claimed through the trial that she had also lied to him about the baby's medical care, and that he believed the young boy was receiving attention, the Palladium-Item reported.

His attorneys said expert testimony showed that Pierson was likely to take the facts at face value and did not have the cognitive abilities to investigate the matter for himself.

Khaiden had been born a healthy 8 pounds, 7 ounces in October 2011, and had just one visit to the doctor a week after his birth. After the visit, he began slowly dying, prosecutors said.

A video showed to the courtroom revealed piles of clothing, overflowing trash cans, dirty dishes, rotting food and feces littered throughout the couple's home.

Khaiden was forced to sleep in a 
swing that was soaked with his urine; jurors were shown pictures of the 
swing pad covered in yellow and brown stains.

Loss: Khaiden was found unresponsive at their home weighing just 6 lbs. He was born weighing 8lbs 7oz

Victim: The baby boy was forced to sleep in a urine-soaked swing at the couple's filthy home

Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Shipman 
said the couple did not give the baby food, bathe him or change his 
diapers, and he quickly lost weight.

When other relatives inquired about his health, Hockett said she had taken him for tests.

'He died because the people who were 
supposed to care the most for him didn't,' Shipman said. 'Nobody was there when this 
little guy died alone in the back room of the house.'

Pierson's attorney, Michael Dean,
 argued that the boy died from a lack of medical attention, rather than 
starvation, and that his client had been duped to believe he was 
receiving such care.

'The entire web of lies started with 
family members... all people with more intelligence than Joseph 
Pierson,' he said. 'They were able to assess the situation better than 
Joseph Pierson, and they all bought it.'

Hockett was found guilty of murder, 
neglect of a dependent resulting in death and neglect of a dependent. 
Pierson was found guilty but mentally ill of reckless homicide, neglect 
of a dependent resulting in death and neglect of a dependent.

Scene: The jury saw images from inside the home, pictured, showing trash, rotting food and feces

Expert witnesses said that while Pierson 
was mildly mentally retarded, he did not meet the state's criteria for 
being considered insane at the time of the death.

Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Shipman told the Indy Star that he was not surprised by the decision.

'Based on the evidence, I can see 
where the jury would see Amy Hockett being more responsible for 
Khaiden's death,' he said. 'He is mildly mentally handicapped, and I 
think that made a difference in what the jury felt.'

Hockett faces 45 to 65 years in prison for murder and 20 to 50 years in prison for neglect of a dependent resulting in death, while Pierson faces 20 to 50 years for neglect of a dependent resulting in death and two to eight years in prison for reckless homicide. They could be served concurrently.

They will be sentenced on March 7.

As his weight dropped, his mother Amy Hockett, 22, told relatives doctors had taken tests for a variety of diseases - yet he had never been

Father Joseph Pierson, 25, was also duped by Hockett as he is 'mildly mentally retarded' but did not seek any help for the baby
