A Michigan mother-of-two has claimed a Catholic hospital could have killed her after it forced her to suffer through a painful miscarriage at 18 weeks because it doesn't believe in abortion.

Tamesha Means, 30, of Muskegon, with 
the help of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Friday 
against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops regarding 
treatment she allegedly received at Mercy Health Partners hospital in December 2010.

Then 27, the suit claims Means visited the hospital - the only one in her county - three times after her water broke some five months early.

But she was given medication and told to go home, according to NBC News. On the third visit, hospital staff again tried to send her home but she miscarried and the fetus was delivered feet-first in a painful and prolonged breech delivery.

'Each time I went into the hospital, the same thing happened,' Means told NBC through an ACLU spokeswoman.

'They should act like it's their mother or sister or daughter they're treating. I pray to God someone stops this from happening again. My life could have been taken. I was in a very dangerous situation.'

Mercy Health Partners is part of Trinity Health, a Catholic-run medical group that prohibits abortion in its hospitals.

Because of this stance, doctors did not 
tell Means that the fetus had 'virtually no chance of surviving' and 
that continuing the pregnancy would put her own life at risk.

'Nor did MHP tell Ms. Means that the safest treatment option was to induce labor and terminate the pregnancy,' the complaint says.

'MHP also did not tell Ms. Means that it would not terminate her pregnancy, even if necessary for her health, because it was prohibited from doing so by the Directives.'

Means and ACLU aims to highlight the 'trauma and harm that Tamesha and other pregnant women in similar situations have experienced at Catholic-sponsored hospitals.'

The suit says Means' case was one of five instances at Mercy Health Partners where doctors refused to induce labor in pregnant women whose water broke before their fetuses could possibly survive.

The hospital declined to comment to 
MailOnline and the Conference of Catholic Bishops has not responded to a
request for comment.

The hospital's vice president of mission services Joseph O'Meara told NBC the directives authorized by the Catholic bishops prohibited the hospital from inducing labor.

Catholic systems run 630 of the nearly 5,000 community hospitals in the country, according to the Catholic Health Association of the United States.

The suit is seeking damages awarded at a jury trial.
