Wayne Rooney's bid to impress new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal appears to be working during their pre-season training.

The 28-year-old received a celebratory hug from Van Gaal after scoring directly from a corner during practice on Tuesday night.

Fans favourite: Van Gaal appears to have already endeared himself to the United fans as acknowledges them

All smiles: Van Gaal will take charge of his first pre-season match as United boss on Thursday against LA Galaxy

Working on their set pieces, Rooney managed to fire in an effort inside the near post to the delight of the Dutchman who proceeded to hug him much to the delight of the fans watching inside the Rose Bowl stadium.

The moment was reminiscent of Van Gaal's appraisal for compatriot Robin van Persie - after his spectacular diving header against Spain in Holland's 5-1 World Cup win last month.

Van Gaal, who led Holland to the semi-finals in Brazil, looks to have already endeared himself to the Red Devils fan base as he acknowledged them after they cheered wildly for his part in congratulating the England international.

United were training in California ahead of their first pre-season game against LA Galaxy on Thursday.

United take part in the Chevrolet Cup against their MLS counterparts in California's Rose Bowl stadium before heading to Denver, Washington DC and Detroit during their pre-season tour against Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

Deja-vu? Van Gaal's (right) embrace with Rooney was similar to his and Robin Van Persie's at the World Cup
