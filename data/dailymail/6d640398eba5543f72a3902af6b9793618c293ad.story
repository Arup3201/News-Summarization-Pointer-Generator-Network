She may have been forced to admit snorting cocaine but Nigella Lawson’s court ordeal won the hearts of the public, her former housekeepers claimed yesterday.

Lisa and Francesca Grillo were speaking on television for the first time since being cleared of fraud last month.

They had been accused of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them by Miss Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

Interview: Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo said that Nigella Lawson won the hearts of the public despite the allegations that emerged during their fraud trial

Accused: Elisabetta, 41, (left) and her sister Francesca, 35, (right) both described standing trial as a 'nightare come true' as they appeared on ITV's This Morning today

The pair were acquitted by a jury even
 though Francesca, 35, had used her family card to spend £8,000 on 
designer clothes in a single day.

Their
 defence, which involved lurid drug allegations against their former 
boss, was that the TV cook let them spend whatever they liked providing 
they kept quiet about her cocaine and cannabis use.

Police
 have said they may take action over Miss Lawson’s confession to using 
cocaine and routinely smoking cannabis, sometimes in front of her 
teenage children.

The jury 
also heard Miss Lawson describe her ex-husband as a ‘brilliant but 
brutal man’ who grabbed her throat out of jealousy when she idly wished 
for grandchildren, and who she said drove her to drugs with his 
‘intimate terrorism’.

FOOTAGE FROM ITV THIS MORNING

Speaking
 on ITV’s This Morning yesterday, the Italian sisters – dubbed ‘the 
greedy Grillos’ by the prosecution – said they had merely won their 
freedom, while Miss Lawson had established herself as a public 
favourite.

Francesca, who 
lives with her sister in central London, said: ‘We have won the court 
case but definitely she had the most support from the public.

'She
 is well loved and she will always be loved and I am sure she will be 
fine. She is great at what she is doing and I wish her all the best.’

'Nighamare': The Grillo sisters, appearing on ITV's This Morning today, speak about their ordeal having to defend themselves in court

Court ordeal: Nigela Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi both gave evidence against their former aides Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo doing the case at Isleworth Crown Court last month

Last
 week Miss Lawson – whose latest show The Taste started on Channel 4 
last night – appeared on US TV as part of her bid to boost her profile 
there and said her ‘only desire’ during the trial had been to protect 
her children ‘which alas I couldn’t always do’.

Referring
 to details of her doomed marriage to Mr Saatchi being revealed in 
court, the 54-year-old said: ‘To have not only your private life but 
distortions of your private life put on display is mortifying’.

Speaking on TV yesterday, the Grillos said that it was ‘brave’ of Miss Lawson to admit that she had taken cocaine.

Court ordeal: Nigella Lawson spent two days on the witness stand where she admitted snorting cocaine and was questioned about the breakdown of her marriage to Charles Saatchi

Anguish: Nigella Lawson opened up about her ordeal of giving evidence in court during an interview on US television last week

But
 they said that they did not feel guilty about her having to give such 
personal evidence because their own freedom was at stake.

Francesca said: ‘It was tough – but it was more tough to sit down in a dock and think, “I might be in prison for a long time”.’

She
 said the sisters were close to Miss Lawson’s family and to be arrested 
and accused of fraud in the summer of 2012 felt like being betrayed by 
her own mother.

Talking of her defence leading to Miss Lawson’s family affairs being aired publicly, she said: ‘We shouldn’t have reached that.

'I wish it didn’t happen, but I had to think about my freedom.’

Of
 Miss Lawson’s drugs admissions, Lisa, 41, added: ‘I feel sorry that we 
ended up in that situation... But no, not guilty, because it was nothing
 to do with me, it’s her life.’

Not
 surprisingly, given that Miss Lawson wanted them prosecuted, Francesca 
admitted she could not foresee them repairing their relationship with 
the TV cook in the immediate future.

‘It’s like a broken mirror – you can glue it back together but you see all the cracks,’ she said.

US
 chef Anthony Bourdain made the comment in the opening episode of Miss 
Lawson’s new Channel 4 cookery competition, in which they and French 
chef Ludo Lefebvre fight to find the most talented chef among 25 
contestants.
