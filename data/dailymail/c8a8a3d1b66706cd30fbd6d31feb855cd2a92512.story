This little squirrel tries to keep himself snug as snow starts to fall around him.

Trying to keep warm in winter, he keeps his arms tightly wrapped as he wanders through the park in search of food.

These close-up photos of a trembling Eastern grey squirrel were taken by social worker David LaMason, 38, of Baltimore, Maryland, USA, whilst walking through his local park.

'It was particularly cold outside, 
and there were a few squirrels about that were not shy about coming up 
to people in the park,' says Mr LaMason.Â 

'The
 snow was just starting to fall and he stood there very still for only a
 few minutes, but that was plenty of time to snap off a few shots

'I was able to get fairly close, squat down and fire off a few shots before he scurried back up a tree.'

Squirrels live in almost every habitat from tropical rainforest to deserts, avoiding only the high polar regions and very dry deserts.
