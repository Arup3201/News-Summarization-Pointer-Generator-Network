Nigel Pearson insists he and his Leicester City players still believe they can stay up but admits Saturday’s match against Hull is ‘must win’.

Leicester have only played once since drawing at Everton on February 22 – losing 2-0 to Manchester City on March 4 – and have slipped seven points away from safety in that time.

Pearson’s side lie bottom of the table on 18 points, seven behind Aston Villa in 17th with a game against Chelsea in hand.

But Pearson has not given up hope yet. 'We still have a strong belief in our ability to stay up this season,’ he said. 'Whether other people share it is not that important at the moment. In house there is a feeling we can do it.

'Saturday is a game both sides want to win. But Hull may be happier with the draw than us. We certainly need to win the game.’

Pearson thinks once one victory comes, others can follow. 'That is something we keep very much in our minds because we do have that belief. But you have to get that first one. This is a game a lot of people see as being a pivotal one we have. It will be a difficult game.’

Leicester recorded one of their four Premier League victories in the reverse fixture at the KC Stadium dismissed talk of planning for relegation. 'Now’s not the times to be talking in those terms,’ Pearson added. 'I remain very focussed on the job that needs to be done this season, to negotiate a way through the last 11 games to get enough points to stay up. We always plan ahead, there has to be realism about it.’
