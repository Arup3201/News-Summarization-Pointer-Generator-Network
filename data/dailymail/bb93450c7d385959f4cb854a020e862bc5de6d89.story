For a deadline day which ranked as relatively low key in comparison to previous transfer windows, it still managed to throw up all manner of questions and puzzlers.

Here, Sportsmail attempts to answer some of the complexities which emerged and managed to bamboozle us all amid the lack of transfer activity...

Right, let’s start with the ‘deadline’ itself – when is it?

It is still 11pm. Domestic transfers, however, can be granted an extension until 1am, and international transfers until midnight.

So if you realise at 11.30pm you need a new striker then you can get on the phone?

No – a ‘deal sheet’ must be submitted to the Premier League before 11pm. So, in effect, that is still the deadline for all parties agreeing to a transfer and putting their approval to a sheet which says it is going to happen.

If the Premier League has this by 11pm then they will grant an extension to finalise all other paperwork.

What is a ‘deal sheet’?

It is an emergency measure which can only be used after 9pm and no later than 11pm. After that documents such as the contract, the transfer agreement and permission to work in the UK must be submitted.

Hull submitted a deal sheet in the case of Dame N’Doye, who they signed from Lokomotiv Moscow but only confirmed at midnight.

This one is a bit of a head-scratcher - how many clubs can a player represent in one season?

FIFA rules state that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs but can only play for two of those.

Hatem Ben Arfa is the most high-profile example of a player who has fallen foul of this. He signed for Nice after being released from his contract at Newcastle but FIFA intervened and prevented him from playing for the Ligue 1 club.

Why? Well, he had already appeared for Hull during a season-long stay – which was terminated in January – and for Newcastle’s Under-21s, which is classed as an official fixture by FIFA. Therefore, he was free to sign for Nice but not eligible to play.

Is there a way around this for Ben Arfa?

Yes. He could move to the MLS because their 2015 season starts in March and FIFA makes allowances for campaigns in different countries overlapping.

Why then has Tom Ince signed for Derby after playing for Hull and Nottingham Forest already this season?

In England we have the term ‘emergency loan’ which is classified as anything up to 93 days and is not subject to the above rules. For the record, ‘emergency loan’ is a Football League term and not one which is particularly endorsed by the Premier League.

Anyway, Ince’s loan stay at Forest was a short-term deal and that is why he is free to sign for Derby until the end of the season. It also why, for example, Connor Wickham was able to play for Sunderland, Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United last season.

Newcastle have sent FIVE players on loan to Rangers! How?

In Scotland (and the English Football League) you are allowed to loan a maximum of two players from one club. However, under SFA rules, there is no restriction on cross-border loans, hence Rangers being able to bring in five Newcastle players in one hit.

As for the dual interest of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley and his 8.9 per cent stake in Rangers, well that raises questions for another topic entirely.

What happened with Mauro Zarate and Matt Jarvis?

Zarate signed for QPR on loan earlier this month from West Ham. Premier League rules state you can only loan one player from another top-flight club.

QPR then decided that they didn’t need Zarate and instead wanted Jarvis from West Ham. No problem, they thought, swap Zarate for Jarvis.

However, Premier League rules also state that a player cannot return to his parent club in the same transfer window in which he has left. The deal, therefore, collapsed and Zarate remained at QPR, Jarvis at West Ham.

Harry Redknapp tried to swap the loan deals of West Ham's Mauro Zarate and Matt Jarvis but was denied 

Finally, what happened with Danny Ings?

For now he remains 100 per cent a Burnley player. A pre-contract agreement with Real Sociedad (which he was eligible to sign with a foreign club because his contract expires in the summer) never materialised. There was also a suggestion that he could sign for Liverpool and be loaned back immediately to the Clarets.

However, Premier League rule V.7.1 states, ‘a temporary transfer to a club may not take place in the transfer window in which the transferor club acquired the player’s registration’. Note that this does not apply to deals between Premier League and Football League clubs, hence Spurs were able to loan back Dele Alli to MK Dons.

But Ings could still sign what is known as a U8 agreement with Liverpool, which allows contract rights to be passed over at a future date and can be signed outside of the transfer window.

Also, because Ings is under 23 and out of contract in June, a tribunal will set the compensation fee paid to Burnley unless the two clubs can reach an agreement.
