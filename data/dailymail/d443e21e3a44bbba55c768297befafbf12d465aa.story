Hundreds of sex offenders who are supposed to be closely monitored have been missing for up to 14 years - but police have refused to name dozens in case they breach their 'human rights'. 

Police forces across Britain have lost track of 396 registered sex offenders, including rapists and paedophiles, but they won't be identified in case it 'endangers their safety unnecessarily', one force said.

The sex attackers are meant to be kept under close surveillance after being released from jail because many pose a 'risk of serious harm to the public'.

Scotland Yard, the UK's largest force, has lost track of 167 sex offenders, including one who had been missing for 14 years

But figures released yesterday found that some have been missing for more than a decade.

There are 23 from Greater Manchester are among the almost 400 missing nationally and police believe 11 have fled abroad and the other 12 are subject to 'periodic reviews' in a bid to trace them.

But the force said today it would not name them to protect their rights.

A spokesman said: 'It is not the policy of GMP or the Police Service of England and Wales to routinely name sex offenders whether they are missing or not as this would be a breach of their human rights. This also may endanger their safety unnecessarily and may also lead to the identification of victims.' 

Scotland Yard, the UK's largest force, has lost track of 167 sex offenders, including one who had been missing for 14 years.

Among the missing is failed asylum seeker Patrick Mosekwe Kanda, 36, who was jailed in 1998 for raping a child.

When the Congolese national was released in 2003 he was allowed to live at an address in Dagenham, East London, instead of being deported.

Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was abducted and killed in 2000 by convicted paedophile Roy Whiting, said: 'It's completely unacceptable that any registered sex offenders have disappeared from authority management, putting the public at risk'

Like other dangerous predators, Kanda was placed on the sex offenders register and was supposed to be monitored by police and probation officials.

But Scotland Yard last month admitted it had lost track of the rapist two years ago and issued an appeal for information relating to his whereabouts.

A spokesman for the Met force blamed London's 'diverse multicultural population' for losing so many sex offenders and admitted that many have probably fled the country.

Last night Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was abducted and killed in 2000 by convicted paedophile Roy Whiting, said: 'It's completely unacceptable that any registered sex offenders have disappeared from authority management, putting the public at risk.

'It's time to take some serious pro-active action to bring them back under the police radar.'

The NSPCC described the figures as 'alarming' and said there are 900 police staff currently responsible for monitoring 46,000 registered sex offenders. This equates to one officer being tasked with monitoring 51 sex criminals.

Jon Brown, the NSPCC's head of sexual abuse programmes, said: 'About half of those on the register are offenders who have raped or sexually assaulted children, or committed online child abuse image offences. However most just receive one police visit a year after they have been released from prison.

'The monitoring of registered sex offenders in communities needs urgent attention by the government to ensure it is fit for purpose.'

'It seems this area is currently chronically under resourced and the number of dangerous individuals on the register is increasing yearly.'

Claude Knights, chief executive of children's charity Kidscape, added: 'We know that sex offenders are at their most volatile and dangerous when they are living in chaotic and unsettled circumstances.

'Registered sex offenders who are of no fixed abode are very difficult to assess and monitor, and most importantly are not complying with notification requirements.

'The safety of our communities depends on predators being on the appropriate radars. We have a duty of care to potential victims.'

Protection: Greater Manchester Police (headquarters pictured) said today it would not name the missing sex offenders 'as this would be a breach of their human rights'

The figures emerged from Freedom of Information requests submitted to all police forces in Britain.

One convicted sex offender from Gloucestershire has been missing since the year 2000, another in Northumbria disappeared in May 2002.

Meanwhile Humberside Police said the whereabouts of one registered sex offender has remained a mystery since September 2004.

West Midlands Police said 39 registered sex offenders were missing, including one since 2006 and nine who have disappeared between 2010 and 2012.

In Manchester, police have lost track of 25 sex attackers, including one who disappeared in September 2005 and three others who went missing in 2006.

Both Essex and Sussex police forces said 11 registered sex offenders are missing from their respective areas, while Cambridgeshire Police said it has lost track of 10 on their list.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK has some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders and we are committed to ensuring the system is as robust as possible.

'It is for the police to manage offenders in their area, but we work closely with forces to ensure legislation is effective and that officers have all the tools they need.'
