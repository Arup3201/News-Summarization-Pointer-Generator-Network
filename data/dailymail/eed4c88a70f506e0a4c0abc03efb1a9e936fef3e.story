Copycat: Lizabeth Donohoe is charged with possession of a firearm by a minor and endangering the welfare of children after police recovered two handguns from her son's bedroom

A suburban Philadelphia teenager has been arrested after threatening to carry out a copycat shooting at his high school less than a week after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.

Worried police reportedly recovered two handguns from the Council Rock South High Schooler's home after students - and their parents - tipped off  authorities on Thursday to the ninth-grader's ominous threats to harm his peers and teachers.

In the teen's bedroom, Northampton Township Police easily discovered two 9 mm handguns in plain sight, according to Detective Sgt. Bill Klein, who added a more thorough search would ensue after the issuance of a search warrant.

The student's mother was charged with drug and weapons counts, and a man at the home was also hit with obstruction of justice and resisting arrest raps, Klein said. The unnamed student remains at a juvenile facility.

The Council Rock School District is located in Newtown, Pennsylvania which eerily shares the same name as the Connecticut municipality in which gunman Adam Lanza slaughtered 20 elementary school students and six adults Dec. 14.

Council Rock South High School is located in nearby Holland.

The student didn't reference the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in his own hreats, said Klein, who added, 'The statements were made in school by the juvenile to peers. It spread kind of rapidly.'

A timely tip: Police searched the student's home after at least two fellow students - and their parents - alerted authorities to threats he had made during the school day

Easily found: Police searching the student's bedroom discovered the two guns in plain sight. A more thorough search will follow once a search warrant is obtained, police said

Copycats: A spate of 'copycat' threats have swept the region following the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

'We determined early on that it was credible,' Klein added, 'We weren't sure he had the means to carry it out, but in affecting the arrest, we found the two handguns and that certainly ramped things up.'

Council Rock South High School canceled classes Friday, but Klein said it appears no other students were involved in the 9th-grader's nascent plot. The district said it canceled classes so police could search the school.

The incident comes as an alarming spate of such incidents further fray the nerves of an already jittery nation.

On Friday, officials closed Emmaus High School in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania after a bomb threat, while police in suburban Pittsburgh took two students into custody after a pair of shooting threats at Hopewell High School.

Meanwhile, police arrested a Mainland Regional High School student in southern New Jersey for an alleged text threat, while Absegami High School, also in southern New Jersey, tightened security following baseless reports of a Facebook 'hit list.'

Perhaps most notably, police recovered electronic components and suspicious chemicals earlier in the week inside the home of a 16-year-old Cedar Creek High School student in Galloway Township, New Jersey.

The troubling discovery came after the student's teacher reportedly noticed on Tuesday apparent drawings of weapons etched in the teen's notebook, according to The Press of Atlantic City.

School officials contacted authorities, which searched the youngster's home. The unidentified teen was charged with possession of an explosive device and placed in Harborfields Juvenile Detention Center.  

As a precaution, bomb-sniffing dogs swept Cedar Creek High School to no avail. Authorities say students and teachers at the school were never in any danger nor were any threats made.
