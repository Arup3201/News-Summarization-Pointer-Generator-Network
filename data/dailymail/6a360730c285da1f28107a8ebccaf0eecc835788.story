A Twitter user was arrested today over claims he revealed the identity of the alleged victim in the child sex case involving Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell.

Le Vell, who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap, appeared in court earlier this week charged with 19 sexual offences against a child.

Police said the tweet, sent on Wednesday, also contained 'personal opinion' from the sender about Le Vell's alleged victim.

Under law, victims of all sexual offences are automatically granted anonymity for life.

A 23-year-old man from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, was arrested on suspicion of publishing a name, address or photograph that would identify someone that should be anonymous.

He was held in custody for questioning and later released on bail pending further inquiries, police said.

Under the Sexual Offences Act 1992, anyone who makes an allegation of a sexual offence is granted automatic anonymity for life.

This means that 'neither the name nor address, and no still or moving picture, of that person shall... be published in a written publication available to the public.'

It also prevents any details being published of either the accused or the accuser if it is likely to lead to that person being identified.

Crucially, the reference to 'publication' also includes social media like Twitter and Facebook as much as more traditional forms of communication like newspaper and TV.

This little-understood law landed seven men and two women in the dock last year when they were fined for naming the rape victim of footballer Ched Evans on Twitter.

The Welsh striker was convicted of raping the 19-year-old woman in April 2012.

During the case, more than 6,000 tweets were sent, with some users choosing to name the victim.

All those who admitted the offence said they did not realise they had broken the law.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Bridge, 
of Greater Manchester Police's Public Protection Division, said: 
'Maintaining the anonymity of victims of sex offences is absolutely 
vital and is something that really helps encourage them to come forward.

'Breaching this ruling is an extremely serious offence and that is why we launched an investigation as soon as we became aware.

'Social media is an immensely powerful tool that does an awful lot of good.

'But it can also be used to spread rumour, speculation and in this case break the law.

'As a force, GMP embraces the use of social media but when it is abused in this way we will take robust action to hold those responsible to account.'

Le Vell, 48, whose real name is Michael Turner, faced the charges at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

The alleged offences date between 2001 and 2010 and include six charges of rape, six of indecent assault and seven of sexual touching.

The actor, from Hale, Cheshire, was bailed to appear at Manchester Crown Court on March 20.

He has denied any wrongdoing and his solicitor said the charges would be 'fully contested' at the crown court.
