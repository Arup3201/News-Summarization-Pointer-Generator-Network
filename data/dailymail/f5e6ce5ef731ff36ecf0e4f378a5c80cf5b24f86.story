Cristiano Ronaldo has denied that his alleged nickname for Lionel Messi behind closed doors is 'motherf*****'.

The Real Madrid forward was accused of regularly referring to his Barcelona counterpart by the name in Guillem Balague's  book, MESSI, but Ronaldo insists it is untrue.

'News is circulating that I allegedly made offending remarks regarding Lionel Messi,' the 29-year-old wrote on his official Facebook page.

The Real Madrid forward insists he does not refer to his Barcelona counterpart as 'motherf*****' and that he respects his Ballon d'Or rival

'This is absolutely false and I have assured my lawyer takes action to sue those responsible. 

'I have the utmost respect for all my professional colleagues, and Messi is obviously no exception.'

Balague's book discusses the relationship between the two, insisting they are not friends but act politely in public for the benefit of the media.

The Spanish football journalist claims several players at the Bernabeu relayed the information to him, and that Ronaldo not only calls Messi  'motherf*****' but also anyone who is caught speaking to his Ballon d'Or rival. 

Ronaldo has been preparing for Portugal's Euro 2016 qualifying match against Armenia on Friday, while Messi was training at West Ham's Rush Green Stadium on Tuesday. The Barca star will be on show at Upton Park on Wednesday night for Argentina's friendly against Croatia.

5th: Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) - 50

Ronaldo and Messi are set to face each other next Tuesday when Portugal and Argentina play in a friendly at Old Trafford, giving the ex-United man the edge on his former stomping ground.

Elsewhere, the pair have become entangled in a race to break Raul's all-time Champions League goal record, which stands at 71.

Messi equalled the record with two goals against Ajax to bring him to 71 in 90 games, while Ronaldo has 70 in 111. 

The man from the Nou Camp is favourite to overtake Raul when Luis Enrique's team play Apoel Nicosia the night before Real face Basle towards the end of November. 

Ronaldo's retaliation comes after it was revealed he and Messi could have played together at Barcelona, had Real not held their nerve over his £80million move from United.

The Portuguese was almost priced out of a switch to the Spanish capital club as Florentino Perez felt he was too expensive. That is the startling admission by the club's former president Ramon Calderon, who claims his successor wasn't prepared to pay.
