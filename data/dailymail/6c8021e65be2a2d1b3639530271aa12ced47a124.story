Tara the cat has drawn more than 20million views on YouTube, tossed the first pitch at a baseball game, and now California's heroic feline is getting her own holiday. 

Last week, the Bakersfield Board of Supervisors proclaimed June 3 Tara the Hero Cat Day to honor  Erica and Roger Triantafilo' furry friend for valiantly saving their 4-year-old son from a vicious dog.

On Tuesday, the Traintfilos arrived at the Kern County Board of Supervisors chambers in Bakersfield for the ceremony with Tara in tow on a leash.

Town officials presented the family with a certificate of recognition and threw in some toys for the four-legged hero.

Tara's owners said they were overwhelmed by the community's response to the now-viral video showing the fearless kitty coming to the rescue of their son, Jeremy.

‘To have this recognition is unreal. We're proud to be a part of this community. Kern County is our home and we love it,’ Roger Triantafilo told Bakersfield Now. 

Some star-struck Bakersfield supervisors even asked to pose for selfies with the cat of the hour, who did not appear bothered by all the attention. 

For the humble whiskered hero, this was only the latest in a series of honors.

On May 20, the tabby threw the first pitch at a Bakersfield Blaze home game at Same Lynn Ballpark.

She was carried onto the pitch by Roger Triantafilo, accompanied by his son, Jeremy, who she saved from the dog attack, and his wife, Erica.

Tara, however, didn’t quite play ball.
 Organizers had provided a baseball attached to a piece of string for the ceremonial first pitch, but 
she wasn’t very interested in swatting it.

Three days later, Tara made an appearance at the Bakersfield Condors hockey game and dropped the puck with the help of her owners.

Three weeks ago, she became the nation's most beloved cat when surveillance 
footage emerged showing her saving Jeremy by pouncing on the 
neighbor's dog as it attacked him.

Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born.

She followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said.

'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat 
take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo said. 'That dog did not 
even know what hit him.'

Erica explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the neighbor's dog, an eight-month-old male Labrador-Chow mix, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg.

'I'd never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.'

After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side.

In an interview with the Bakersfield Californian,
 his family said she had always been protective over their oldest child 
and slept in his crib when he was a baby. They also have younger twin 
boys.

They added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, even though Erica is allergic to cats.

She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said.

They named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means driftwood.

'We named her driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.'

She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it. 

Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when a neighbor's dog escaped and ran towards him

'She's the most mellow cat you've ever seen,' she told Today. 'All our boys love her... and she loves them right back.'

The video had shown 
Jeremy sitting on his bicycle outside his family's home on Tuesday when 
the dog escaped its home through an open gate and crept up on him from 
behind.

Surveillance footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently shaking him with his teeth clamped tight.

Then suddenly, an unlikely hero bounds towards him - the family's cat, Tara.

The
 video shows the fearless feline jumping on the dog with enough force to
 push him away from the boy. Tara then chases the dog away from the 
driveway with its leg between its tail.

And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy

The neighbor, who had been pulling out of their gated driveway when the dog escaped, called 911 for the boy and his mother, KERO reported.

The boy, who has mild autism, needed stitches to the deep wounds on his legs but is otherwise fine.

'He's just bouncing back from this,' she told Today. 'He
 tells us it feels better.'

Speaking to Kero, he said: 'Tara is my hero!'

The dog was taken by Bakersfield Animal Control and was later put down.

Injuries: Jeremy needed stitches to the wounds on his leg, pictured, but is otherwise fine, his mother said

Relief: Jeremy's parents, Erica and Roger, pictured, said they were relieved his injuries were not worse

The 
encounter was caught on surveillance cameras outside the home and 
uploaded to YouTube by the boy's father.

'My cat 
defends my son during a vicious dog attack and runs the dog off before 
he can do additional damage,' Triantafilo wrote beneath the video. 
'Thankfully, my son is fine!'

The
 boy's mother said on Facebook: 'We aren't upset with our neighbors, 
we're just thankful our son wasn't injured more... Our cat is my hero!'

'Whoever said cats don't love their owners!' one YouTube viewer said.
