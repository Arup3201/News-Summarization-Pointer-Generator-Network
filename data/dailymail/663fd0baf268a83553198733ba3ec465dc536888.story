City officials have apologized for saying 12-year-old Tamir Rice 'directly caused' his own fatal shooting by police while he brandished a pellet gun.

Lawyers for the city of Cleveland, Ohio, prompted outrage by making the claim as they responded to a wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of the boy's distraught family.

An officer shot Tamir dead just two seconds after he encountered the boy playing in a park with his sister on November 22 - despite the initial caller telling police the gun was 'probably fake'.

'Insensitive': The mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, has apologized for a response to the wrongful death lawsuit which blamed 12-year-old Tamir Rice (above) for his fatal shooting by police on November 22

'Directly caused by his own acts': The offending part of the court documents which were filed last week

Innocent: The city has said that Tamir (above) failed 'to exercise due care to avoid injury' when he was shot by police officer Timothy Loehmann. An initial caller told a dispatcher the gun was 'probably fake'

Yet the lawsuit response said Tamir's 'injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by' his own acts.

Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson has now apologized for the wording of the response and said it will be changed in the next three weeks after he spokes to Tamir's family. 

'In an attempt to protect our defenses, we used words and phrased things in such a way that was very insensitive to the tragedy in general and the victim in particular,' he told reporters.

'We are apologizing to the family and the citizens of the city of Cleveland for our poor use of those words, and our insensitivity for the use of those words.'

He added: 'We are sincerely apologetic for our misuse and mischaracterization of our answer to that complaint.'

The court documents filed late last week by the city said Tamir's injuries and the subsequent complaints for damages stemmed from his actions and failure 'to exercise due care to avoid injury.'

Shock: Tamir, 12, was shot dead (above) by a police officer two seconds after arriving on the scene even though the boy was holding a pellet gun. His sister was handcuffed after running towards him

NOTE: Plaintiffs are Tamir's family, and plaintiffs' decedent is Tamir himself

215. Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the failure of Plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury.

216. Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the acts of Plaintiffs' decedent, not this Defendant.

217. Plaintiffs' injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by their own acts, not this Defendant.

It said the Defendant, police officer Timothy Loehmann, was in no way responsible with all blame resting on the 12-year-old boy. 

Tamir was shot in the abdomen by an officer responding to a call about someone with a firearm near a recreation center.

After the confrontation was captured on surveillance video, it became clear Tamir had been carrying what turned out to be an airsoft-type gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets.

The federal lawsuit alleges excessive force, negligence, infliction of emotional distress on his sister and mother, violation of due process for the parents, and failure by the responding officers to immediately provide first aid to the boy, who died the next day.  

It also claims false imprisonment of Tamir's sister Tajai, 14, who was tackled by an officer as she ran towards his body screaming 'my baby brother, they killed my baby brother.'

The officers then handcuffed the young girl and threw her in the back of a squad car.

At no point was Tamir given medical attention until an FBI agent on a nearby bank detail arrived, almost five minutes after the shooting. 

The entire incident, from the moment police arrive on the scene to when Tajai is taken down and handcuffed to the arrival of the agent who provided first aid, was caught on video which the city was initially reluctant to release it to the public. 

The city said in response to the federal lawsuit that it didn't violate Tamir's federal rights and that it is entitled to certain legal immunities.

One of the family's attorneys, Walter Madison, told the Northeast Ohio Media Group that the complaint has merit.

'I do believe that a 12-year-old child died unnecessarily at the hands of Cleveland police officers and I do believe that certain officers shouldn't have been entitled to wear the uniform,' he said. 

The Cuyahoga County sheriff's department is investigating the shooting. A prosecutor has promised that a grand jury will consider whether the case merits criminal charges.
