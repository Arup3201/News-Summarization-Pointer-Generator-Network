There's still five months until Christmas, but the Premier League may already have a new pantomime villain on its hands.

From what we've seen of Diego Costa since his arrival from Atletico Madrid, watching Chelsea will be pretty entertaining next season.

Pushing, shoving, shouting and scoring, Jose Mourinho looks to have found a real live wire in the Spain international.

Perfect start: Costa managed a goal on his debut for the Blues in a 2-1 victory over Olimpija Ljubljana

It's not hard to understand why he's been billed as the man to finally fill Didier Drogba's boots at Stamford Bridge.

He's big, strong, excellent in the air and - above all else - knows where the goal is. Fifty-six goals in two seasons at the Vicente Calderon is testament to that.

The fact Drogba has returned to Stamford Bridge shouldn't hinder Costa's transition. If anything, it should help.

Who better than the Ivorian - one of the best lone strikers to have played in the Premier League - than to guide Chelsea's £32million investment?

Drogba knows the Premier League and its defenders like the back of his hand. That knowledge will prove vital.

Of course, Drogba will still want to play as often as possible next season - but he knows his place at Stamford Bridge.

Costa's the main man, while Drogba is now the supporting act.

That role as a lone centre-forward is vital to the way Mourinho wants his side to play. He tried Samuel Eto'o, Fernando Torres and Demba Ba in the position last season with varying degrees of success.

But in Costa, the Special One knows he has someone with the raw materials to lead the line effectively next season.

You only have to look at his impact on Atletico last season in a similar role to know Costa can cut the mustard for Chelsea.

His bulky 6ft 2ins frame means he is unlikely to suffer at the hands of the Premier League's bully-boys.

The way he stood toe-to-toe with Chelsea skipper John Terry during last season's Champions League semi-final first-leg at the Vicente Calderon spoke volumes.

Perhaps Terry was testing Costa knowing full well they'd be on the same team a few months later.If it was a test, then Costa passed it with flying colours. He didn't flinch as he eyeballed Terry.

Main man: Costa looks certain to lead the line for Chelsea next season after arriving for £32million this summer

And eight days later at Stamford Bridge, an all-action display (some might say Drogba-esque) eased Atletico Madrid into the Champions League final with a 3-1 win.

If Mourinho needed any persuading over Costa, then that night would have halted any lingering doubts.

And now the Portuguese has finally got his hands on the Brazilian-born striker - the man he believes can lead his side to the title.

Whether he can emerge from Drogba's shadow and become Chelsea's next great centre-forward remains to be seen.

But the ingredients are there, and with Drogba on hand to show him the ropes, everything is in situ for Costa to live up to his £32million price tag.

And if he needs any help with living up to his role as a pantomime villain, then his manager knows a thing or two about that.
