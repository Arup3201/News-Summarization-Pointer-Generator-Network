At least a dozen people have been killed by flash floods which have struck the Black Sea resort town of Varna.

Authorities have declared an emergency after torrential rain swept away cars, destroyed houses and forced people to scramble onto rooftops to avoid the raging torrents.

Police in the north-eastern resort town confirmed they have recovered ten bodies from the area after Thursday's deluge. Two further bodies were found in the northern city of Dobrich.
