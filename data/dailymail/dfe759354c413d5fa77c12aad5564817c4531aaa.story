The neighbour said: 'Stef was so excited for this hen do.

'She's getting married in a couple of weeks and she was really looking forward to spending the weekend in Liverpool celebrating with her friends.

'I heard the news and my heart just sank.

'I knew they would be travelling on the M62 and my gut feeling was that it was them involved in the crash.

the same direction as the accident, the westbound carriageway. It was 
effectively gridlocked from 11.30am onwards.

engines and started walking around on the road. By 2-2.30pm three 
quarters of the cars and lorries were empty.

'I was about a third of a mile back 
from where the accident was, I got out and walked up to the scene. There
were probably about 10-15 ambulances, as many police cars, several fire
engines.

'In the midst of all the emergency vehicles I could just about see the scene of the accident.

'I could see a minibus which was on 
its side. It had quite a severe amount of damage on the right hand side.
The lorry which had collided with it was on the main motorway.'
