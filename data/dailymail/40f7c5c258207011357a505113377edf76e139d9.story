Senteced: Lucinda Rodriguez Caldwell jailed for 10 years

A teacher who was caught having sex with a 12-year-old boy has been jailed.

Lucinda Rodriguez Caldwell, 41, a married mother of two,was jailed for 10 years.

The veteran teacher taught fifth grade at Cable Elementary School in the Northside Independent School District in San Antonio.

Caldwell was arrested in July 2010 after the boy's father took him to police to report the sexual assaults.

She was caught after the boy's father recognised her Ford Explorer car outside his house at 3am after realizing that his son was not at home.

After the SUV sped off, the father pursued in his own vehicle for about 30 miles.

Both vehicles were pulled over by a traffic officer in Hondo, reported My San Antonio.

It emerged that young boy had been driving the SUV.

A judge in San Antonio on Tuesday sentenced Caldwell as part of a plea agreement.

Caldwell pleaded no contest to felony indecency with child by exposure.

She originally was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and could have received life in prison if convicted.

Caldwell, who had asked the judge for probation, must give up her teaching license as part of the plea deal.

'I just want to say that I'm sorry 
for what I did and I apologize to the court, to (the child) and his 
family, and to my family,' Caldwell said through tears during the brief 
sentencing hearing.

'I have lost so much because of what I
did, and I ask the court to let me stay with my family and take care of
my children,' she said.

Prosecutors said 
they were told by the family after the allegations were revealed, 
the boy appeared to withdraw from friends and family.Â 

Since the arrest, Caldwell and her two 
children have moved to Eagle Pass.

Her husband testified on her behalf 
Tuesday, saying prior to the incident she had an 'exemplary record' as a teacher.
