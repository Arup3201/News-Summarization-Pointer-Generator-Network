An American man who has spent the last nine months in jail in the United Arab Emirates after posting a video parody on Youtube is to be released soon after being granted time off his sentence for good behaviour.

Shezanne 'Shez' Cassim, 29, was arrested in April and charged with violating a 2012 cyber crime law after posting a 19 minute video that mocks Dubai teenagers who are influenced by hip hop culture.

The video is set at a 'combat school' where gangsters from the suburb of Satwa learn to use their clothing accessories as whips and are advised to throw sandals at their targets.

Release: American Shezanne Cassim was sentenced to a year in prison for creating a parody video about youth culture in Dubai

The United Arab Emirates-owned daily,
 The National, has said Cassim and his co-defendants were accused of 
defaming the country's image abroad.

Cassim's
 supporters said he was charged with endangering state security under a 
2012 cybercrimes law that tightened penalties for challenging 
authorities.

Cassim has 
been in the maximum security prison at Abu Dhabi since June. In 
December, he was convicted and sentenced to one year in prison, a fine 
and deportation.

Comedians 
like Will Ferrell, Adam Mckay, and the rest of the team behind the 
website Funny or Die have been rallying for Cassim's release.Â 

Pooja
 Jhunjhunwala, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Cassim 
has been moved to a deportation facility for processing.

'We
 understand processing will take a few days at which point he will be 
returning to the United States,' she said, adding: 'We continue to work 
closely with the UAE authorities to ensure his quick release.'

Funny or Die did their best to show that Shez was merely trying to exercise his free speech

Cassim's
 family said Cassim is out of his cell block and in a deportation 
processing section of the prison. They expect him to return home this 
week.

'I can't tell you 
how relieved our family is by this turn of events,' Cassim's brother, 
Shervon Cassim, said in a statement. 'We are very excited, and we are 
grateful to everyone who worked to free Shez.'

State
 Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Cassim has been credited with 
pre-trial detention time and given time off for good behavior.

Rori
 Donaghy, director of the London-based Emirates Center for Human Rights,
 said a defendant's release after serving three-fourths of a sentence is
 customary.

Donaghy said 
Cassim and his friends never should have been imprisoned, and the 
cybercrimes law needs to be changed, as authorities have continued to 
use it to restrict free speech.

Cassim,
 a U.S. citizen, was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Dubai for work after
 graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2006.

He became the 
public face of the defendants after his family launched an effort to 
publicize his incarceration.

Seven
 others were convicted with him in December. Two Indian defendants 
received similar sentences, while two Emirati brothers received lighter 
sentences.

Donaghy said 
the Emiratis have been released. Three others - a Canadian, Briton and 
an American - were convicted and sentenced in absentia. They have never 
been detained.

Donaghy said another Emirati who spoke out in support of the amateur filmmakers was arrested and remains imprisoned.

Not even a celebrity-run website dedicated to freeing the young comedian was enough to keep him from jail

Gulf
 Arab authorities have been cracking down on social media use over the 
past two years, with dozens of people arrested across the region for 
Twitter posts deemed offensive to leaders or for social media campaigns 
urging more political openness.

U.S.
 Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who worked on Cassim's release and pushed to have 
his sentence include time served, said: 'Jailing this young man for 
months for posting a harmless video made absolutely no sense, especially
 in a country that prides itself on being a tolerant and just nation.'

Susan
 Burns, an attorney for the family in the U.S., called the United Arab 
Emirates' legal system archaic and unfair.

She said it's great that 
Cassim is coming home but said 'it's ridiculous that he was ever charged
 and put in prison for 275 days in the first place.'
