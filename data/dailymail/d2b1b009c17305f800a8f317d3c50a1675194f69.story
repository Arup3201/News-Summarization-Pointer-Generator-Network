A building owner evicted a pastor and his worshipers from their church because of their fondness for handling venomous snakes while praying and dancing.

Clyde Daugherty, who 
built the LaFollette, Tennessee-based church in 1994, rented the building 
to Andrew Hamblin for just $267 a month but eventually became fed up with all the serpents slithering about and occasionally injuring or killing congregants.

'Too many people were getting hurt and 
dying, and that's a proven fact,' Mr Daugherty told 10News. 'He was focused too 
much on the wrong things, like attention from the media and the TV show,
 instead of the word of God.'

Andrew Hamblin, the pastor of Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, Tennessee, was evicted from his church by the building's owner because of his snake-handling ways

Mr Daugherty said he had offered to sell the
 church, trailers and surrounding property to Mr Hamblin for $66,000, but 
the pastor declined and is now looking for a new building.

Mr Hamblin's Pentecostal church practices a rare, century-old Christian 
tradition of worshiping God with venomous snakes such as timber 
rattlers, cottonmouths and copperheads, according to Urban Christian 
News.

The 22-year-old plays mandolin, loves zombie movies, receives food
 stamps, has five children and was the star of a 16-episode National 
Geographic reality series called Snake Salvation, which featured 
Appalachia's serpent-handling churches. About 125 such churches exist in the U.S.

Pastors use the snakes to show non-Christians that God protects them from harm, holding them aloft as they pray, sing and dance.

The belief stems from a literal reading of Jesus' 
words in the Gospel of Mark: 'And these signs will accompany 
those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak
 in new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any 
deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the 
sick, and they will recover.'

Mr Hamblin, who said he has been bitten 
by poisonous snake many times, made headlines last fall after 
authorities seized more than 50 venomous serpents in his possession. A 
grand jury ultimately didn't indict him after his court appearances drew
 large crowds of supporters.

Mr Hamblin's mentor, fellow reality TV star and snake-wielding pastor Jamie Coots, died in February after being bitten at his church in Middlesboro, Kentucky. His son Cody, 21, took over for him and was bitten by a snake last month.Â 

'I
 was with Jamie in Middlesboro, Kentucky, when he was bit,' Mr Daugherty said. 'Enough is enough. There will be no snakes at my services.'
