The parents of a 13-year-old girl who went missing 25 years ago are 'thrilled' police have started searching their home for more evidence, saying they 're just glad their daughter's case is getting a surge of attention.

Amy Sue Pagnac went missing in 1989 from a gas station in Osseo, Minnesota while her father, Marshall Midden, was using the restroom.

Amy's cold-case disappearance was reopened on Sunday when investigators began searching her childhood home in Maple Grove, telling her parents to leave the property without officially naming the two as suspects.

Come home Amy: Sue Pagnac, mother of missing girl Amy Pagnac, says she's thrilled investigators are searching her home since it's bringing more attention to her daughter's case

In a press conference on Monday, police Capt KeithTerlinden said the search was expected to last until Friday, at the least.

While investigators sift through their house and property, Amy's parents are staying in the garage of another daughter's home.

'I am thrilled that so much attention has finally been placed on Amy, I am hoping this will finally bring her home,' her mother, Susan Pagnac, told MailOnline.

Mrs Pagnac says investigators showed up on Tuesday and told her and her husband to leave for about a week, without giving any explanation for their new search.

However, she thinks some nosy neighbors may be to blame for the renewed efforts.

'I hear a couple of our neighbors, who have hated us for years, are talking and telling people we did a lot of landscaping on our property after Amy disappeared so perhaps that has something to do with what's going on now.

'What they obviously forgot to add is that the work we did was in 1993 and Amy went missing in 1989!

'But for whatever reason, I am very happy they are still looking for my little girl, but I will also be happy when this investigating into our home and family is completed so these people will have to shut up!

'We love Amy and would never do anything to hurt her.'

Mrs Pagnac recalls the day Amy disappeared, saying her husband stopped at the gas station to 'do his business'.

When he came out of the restroom, Amy was gone but he just figured she went to use the bathroom as well.

When a stranger came out instead of his little girl though, Mr Midden started to worry.

New search: Investigators showed up at the Maple Grove, Minnesota home of Amy's parents on Sunday, telling them to leave for about a week so they could conduct a search

What are they looking for? Amy parents' were ordered to leave but have not been named as official suspects in their daughter's 1989 disappearance

Rumors: Ms Pagnac believes that the search may be due to neighbors comments about landscaping projects following Amy's disappearance

'Marshall then started to look around the gas station for her but she had disappeared into thin air!' Ms Pagnac said.

Her husband called home to see if Amy had showed up there, but she hadn't. He then called police and they told him to go home so they could interview the couple together.

'The police began looking for her but there were no witnesses, no calls, nothing and the police kept coming back to us because they said we were the last ones seen with Amy, but that's not true -- obviously!' Ms Pagnac siad.

Over the years, her parents have received information giving them hope that Amy is still alive.

Years ago, a woman who grew up with Amy said she'd seen her 'in one of these places - stripping and prostituting'.

And then there was the time someone was approached at a train station by a girl who said: 'I'm Amy Pagnac'.

'How many people would choose the name Pagnac? Ms Pagnac asked the Star Tribune.Â 

But it's the story a private investigator told Amy's parents in 1990 that they believe the most,

The PI came to town and said Amy had been the victim of a sex-trafficking ring, but by the time police had stepped in the ring had already moved on.

There's also question's about Amy's health state at the time of her disappearance since she was suffering from migraines and had a seizure previously.

'We had been taking her to the doctor to find out the cause of her health problems but did not have a diagnosis yet, they were still taking tests when she vanished.

'Amy was also showing signs of being bi-polar as well as fetal brain tumor symptoms, but the doctors had ruled out she had a tumor, thank goodness, but they did not know what was wrong with her.'

However, they don't believe Amy's health issues would have caused her to run off for 25 years.

'Amy was a very gentle child, who was very sweet and nice to everyone,' her mother said.

Ms Pagnac is certain that someone has more information about her daughter, and is hoping they come forward with that information.

'Amy's age-enhanced picture from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is on their web site so I hope all of the heartache finally ends and we find out what happened to my daughter.'
