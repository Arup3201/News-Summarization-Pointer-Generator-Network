A senior Labour MP was accused of sexism yesterday after remarking on Theresa May’s ‘thin’ appearance – and suggesting her stressful job may have caused weight loss.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, was condemned by female MPs over his comments  on Twitter about the Home Secretary’s figure.

‘A bit worried about Home Secretary, she is looking a bit thin these days. A new diet or pressure of work?’ he wrote.

Vaz described Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured here in 2010 (left) and 2012 (right),  as 'a bit thin'

His remarks caused a backlash from Mrs May’s colleagues, one of whom said Mr Vaz should ‘concentrate on his own waistline’.

Another, equalities minister Helen Grant insisted: ‘She looks fantastic, she is fantastic. She works incredibly hard. Would the same be said of a male MP?’ 

Conservative MP for Romsey, Caroline Nokes, chairman of the all-party group on body image, said Mr Vaz’s remarks were ‘particularly thoughtless’.

‘I think they came across as rather patronising,’ she said. ‘I’m reasonably confident as a woman in politics who has had to bear the brunt of comments about my own weight that this is something that dished out to women MPs and simply isn’t to the same extent to men.

‘I’m very conscious that I have an interesting relationship with food - my weight goes up and down, and people will frequently comment that either I’m looking a bit chubby or have lost a bit of weight.

Keith Vaz took to Twitter to make the 'thoughtless' comments about Mrs May

‘I think it’s sexist. The remark that
Keith very unfortunately put on Twitter was that this was about a woman
who was losing weight because of the pressure of work. It is no secret 
that Theresa has taken up a regime of healthy eating, has been walking a
lot and has lost weight.’ 

Conservative
MP Harriett Baldwin said: ‘Twitter is a medium that people say silly 
things on. I’m sure he would apologise if he thought about it.’

Mrs
May, 56, is thought to have lost a stone and a half over the last year,
having gone on a diet and been working out regularly in the gym. She 
also enjoys energetic holidays in Switzerland, where she goes mountain 
walking.

The Home Secretary
is fiercely protective of her private life, rarely giving personal 
interviews, and her admirers have been irritated by the focus on her 
celebrated kitten-heeled shoes.

There
has been increasing speculation that she could succeed David Cameron as
Conservative leader, having impressed with her steely grip on the Home 
Office, which was a political graveyard for a series of Labour 
ministers.

Earlier this 
week, Mark Reckless, one of the leaders of a Eurosceptic revolt over the
EU budget, said she had ‘good claim now to be the most reforming Home 
Secretary in respect of the police since Sir Robert Peel’.

Mrs
May would never stand against Mr Cameron, but is thought likely to 
throw her hat into the ring in any future contest - particularly if 
Boris Johnson enters the fray.

A
vicar’s daughter, the Cabinet minister is a strong Christian and said 
in a recent interview: ‘I think it’s important to do a good job and not 
to feel that you’ve got to make grand gestures, but just to get on and 
deliver.’ 

Mrs May has encouraged growing comparisons between her and Europe’s most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

‘There
are still people who don’t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps 
because of the way she looks and dresses, and she goes walking in the 
Tyrol and all that sort of stuff,’ she said.

‘What
matters is, what has she actually done? And, when you look at her 
abilities in terms of negotiation, and steering Germany through a 
difficult time, then hats off to her.’ 

A spokesman for Mrs May said she did not wish to respond to Mr Vaz’s remarks.
