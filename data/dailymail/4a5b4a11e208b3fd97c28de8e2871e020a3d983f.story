Looking remarkably well, the Duke of Edinburgh was back to his jocular best yesterday on his first official engagement in nearly two months.

The 92-year-old reduced a roomful of distinguished scientists to laughter at a medal presentation as he said of the winners: 'I wish to God I could understand what they'd been doing'

The Duke was first admitted to the London Clinic on June 6. Following abdominal investigations a pre-arranged operation was carried out the next day.

Philip, 92, handed out medals today at the 
Royal Society of Edinburgh to Professor Sir John Cadogan, Professor 
Michael Ferguson and Sir Ian Wood.

The Duke of Edinburgh said it was a 'great pleasure to be back in circulation' yesterday

The Duke of Edinburgh has been an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh since 1951 and has presented Royal Medals eight times since 2001

The Duke spoke as he made a spontaneous address to the audience in the Royal Society of Edinburgh's (RSE) Wolfson Lecture Theatre.

He told the gathering he wanted to 'add my congratulations to the medal winners'.

Philip added: 'It's now quite a long list since I've been doing this. But it's a great pleasure to be back in circulation again.'

Referring to the medal-winners, the Duke joked: 'I wish to God I could understand what they'd been doing!'

His comments were greeted with laughter and applause from the audience.

The Duke, who wore a dark blue suit and red patterned tie for the occasion, appeared relaxed and happy throughout the event.

The Duke has been an Honorary Fellow 
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh since 1951 and has presented Royal 
Medals eight times since 2001. This has been the seventh consecutive 
year.

The Queen is the Patron of the society while The Prince of Wales and The Princess Royal are Honorary Fellows like the Duke.

The Duke was admitted to the London Clinic on
June 6 and he was discharged 11 days later, when he was said to be in 'good condition and good spirits', and has been recuperating.

The Duke departed from today's event slightly earlier than scheduled.

As he entered and left the building, he smiled and waved at the crowds gathered in George Street, who cheered and clapped.

It is understood Philip wanted to carry out the engagement in Edinburgh as he had been committed to it for a long time.

It marked the ninth time the Duke has handed out Royal Medals at the RSE.

They are awarded in a range of categories, such as life sciences, physical and engineering sciences, humanities and social sciences, business and commerce.

During the ceremony, the Duke took time to exchange a few words with each recipient as they collected their award.

He also presented the James Clerk Maxwell Award to Professors Richard Muller and Richard White, of the University of California, for their pioneering work in microelectro-mechanical systems technology.

Speaking after the event, Professor Sir John Arbuthnott, president of the RSE, welcomed Philip's presence at the annual event.

He said: 'It's wonderful to have him back again at the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He's been here many times and he's been an Honorary Fellow for 60 years.

'I think he shows always a great awareness of the work that these medallists have done. He speaks to them about their subjects and is thoroughly interested in what they do. He very much enjoyed his visit.

'I thought he was very relaxed and under no strain. I thought he was very relaxed indeed.'

During the visit, the Duke also signed a medallists' book and viewed an exhibition about the quest to discover the Higgs boson.

He also got to meet the man who gave 
his name to the particle, Professor Peter Higgs, who was himself awarded
a Royal Medal in 2000.

During
today's award ceremony, Professor Michael Ferguson, Dean of Research 
for the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee, was 
recognised for his work in drug discovery to combat parasites and for 
his leadership of a 'world-class' team of scientists.

Businessman
Sir Ian Wood, former chairman of the Wood Group, was honoured for his 
contribution to business and commerce in Scotland, and for his public 
service through a variety of roles.

'It's now quite a long list since I've been doing this. But it's a great pleasure to be back in circulation again'Â

Professor
Sir John Cadogan, former director of research at BP and president of 
the Learned Society of Wales, was awarded a Royal Medal for his 
'outstanding contribution' to organic chemistry, through his research, 
discovery and invention.

He said it was 'fantastic' to be given the medal by the Duke, whom he first met 62 years ago.

'Little did I know then, when I was 20 years of age, what would happen today,' Prof Sir John said.

'It was very nostalgic really. It brought back the memories because I've met him on a few occasions since.

'What
a great pleasure, because he's such a character. It's a great honour to
this society that he should come and do this at this time.'

Of
receiving the medal, he added: 'Actually it is unbelievable, I can't 
believe it's happened. It gives me enormous pleasure because I've had so
many wonderful years in Scotland and indeed in this society.'

Prof Sir John Arbuthnott said the awards handed out are the RSE's highest accolades.

He
said: 'I wish to extend my congratulations to all of the 2013 Royal 
Medallists and award winners. Each of them is an inspiration.'

The
Duke is now due to go to Balmoral, the Queen's private estate in the 
Scottish Highlands, where he is expected to stay until October before 
returning to London.
