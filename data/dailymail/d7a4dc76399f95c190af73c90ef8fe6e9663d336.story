Benjamin Netanyahu was today scrabbling to cling to power after his alliance won a narrow victory in Israeli elections.

The Prime Minister vowed to seek a 'broad coalition' after the surprise result which saw his right-wing alliance 
Likud-Beiteinu lose 11 seats.

It is still the biggest party in the new parliament with 31 of 120 seats but the win may not be enough for hardliner Netanyahu to keep his position. 

The new centrist Yesh Atid (There is a Future) party, led by television personality Yair Lapid, won a surprising 19 seats, leaving Lapid a key person for Netanyahu to woo in coalition negotiations.

Narrow victory: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been expected to sweep back into power

The results from Tuesday's elections defied forecasts that Israel's next government would veer sharply to the right as the country faces mounting international isolation, growing economic problems and regional turbulence.

Lapid has said he would only join a
government committed to sweeping economic changes and a serious push to
resume peace talks with the Palestinians, which have languished 
throughout Netanyahu's four-year tenure.

As the results were announced Netanyahu, who called 
early elections three months ago expecting easy victory, vowed to form as broad a coalition as 
possible.

He said the next government would be 
built on principles that included reforming the contentious system of 
granting draft exemptions to ultra-Orthodox Jewish men and the 'responsible' pursuit of a 'genuine peace' with the Palestinians.

Netanyahu told Lapid, who now runs the second-largest party: 'We have the opportunity to do 
great things together.'

Commentators said that while a broad coalition offered unexpected movement on peace efforts, a coalition joining parties with dramatically divergent views on peacemaking, the economy and the military draft could just as easily be headed for gridlock - and may not last long.

Under Israel's parliamentary system, voters cast ballots for parties, not individual candidates.

Because no party throughout Israel's 64-year history has ever won an outright majority of parliamentary seats, the country has always been governed by coalitions.

Traditionally, the party that wins the largest number of seats is given the first chance to form a governing alliance in negotiations that center around promising Cabinet posts and policy concessions.

If those negotiations are successful, the leader of that party becomes prime minister. If not, the task falls to a smaller faction.

Netanyahu said: ''I call on the leaders of the political establishment to work with me together, to the best of their ability to form as broad a government as possible that will contain moderate forces from the left and right, the right and the left, so that we will truly be able to bring about real change.'

But political experts said forming a broad coalition would not be easy, and would force Netanyahu to make some difficult decisions.

Lapid said last week that he would not be a 'fig leaf' for a hard-line agenda on peacemaking.

A senior member of his party said Yesh Atid would not join unless the government pledged to begin drafting the ultra-Orthodox into the military, lowered the country's high cost of living, and returned to peace talks.

Yaakov Peri said: 'We have red lines. We won't cross those red lines, even if it will cost us sitting in the opposition.'

Labour, who won 15 seats, making them the third-biggest party, said failed coalition attempts might result in the end of a Netanyahu-led coaltion.

Its leader Shelly Yachimovich said: 'There is no doubt we are watching a political drama unfold before our eyes …

'There is a high chance of a dramatic change, and of the end of the Netanyahu coalition.'

The far-right Jewish Home party, led by Naftali Bennett, won 11 or 12 seats, pending final confirmation, making it one of the largest parties in the Knesset.

Its leader Naftali Bennett said: 'Today we set up a new home that knows how to protect its residents not only with concrete but with martial prowess and power.

'Our enemies will know that you do not mess with Israel.'

The election results surprised Israelis, following recent opinion polls forecasting a more solid hard-line majority and a weaker showing by centrists.

Netanyahu may have suffered because of his close ties to the ultra-Orthodox, and perhaps from complacency. Many voters chose smaller parties, believing a Netanyahu victory was assured.

Tensions with the United States, Israel's most important ally, also may have helped the shift to Lapid.

President Barack Obama was quoted last week as saying that Netanyahu was undermining Israel's own interests by continuing to build Jewish settlements on occupied lands the Palestinians want for a future state.

Netanyahu has won praise at home for drawing the world's attention to Iran's suspect nuclear programme and for keeping the economy on solid ground at a time of global turmoil.

But he has repeatedly clashed with allies over his handling of the peace process, which has stalled over the issue of Israel construction in Jewish settlements in the war-won West Bank and east Jerusalem.

The Palestinians want Netanyahu to halt all settlement construction, but he says talks must start without preconditions and notes a 10-month slowdown he imposed earlier in his term did not encourage meaningful negotiations.

On Wednesday, the Obama administration said the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would not change, regardless of the Israeli election results.

'We will continue to make clear that only through direct negotiations can the Palestinians and the Israelis ... achieve the peace they both deserve,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

The Palestinians viewed the election results grimly.

Mohammed Ishtayeh, a senior advisor to President Mahmoud Abbas, said: 'If he brings Lapid into his government, this would improve the image of the Netanyahu government in the eyes of the world.

'But it won't make him stop building settlements, particularly in east Jerusalem.'
