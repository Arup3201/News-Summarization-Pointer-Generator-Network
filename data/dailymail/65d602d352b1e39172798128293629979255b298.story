His owner Christine Look is hoping he will become an internet sensation. Albert (above), who already has more than 60,000 followers on Instagram, is dressed as Woody from Toy Story

Christine, who is training for the Olympics with the US badminton team, started dressing Albert up with her partner Sandeep around six months ago. She uses her home near Los Angeles as his studio.

She said: 'We are hoping for Albert to become America's next big cat superstar.

'We really want him to be in huge blockbuster movies with all the celebrities like Daniel Craig and Tom Cruise.'

Christine has even purchased a range of props for their photo shoots including a skateboard, car, horse and kitten-sized bath.

She added: 'In the beginning he really detested it and it was a struggle to get him to stay put in the clothes.

'Albert is definitely getting more used to dressing up for photos now.

'It takes around 30 to 45 minutes to take a photo of him but that's only the start.

'I then have all the work leading up to it, shopping for an outfit, thinking of ideas, researching props - then afterwards I have to edit the photos.

'The whole thing can take around three to four hours per photo.'

Albert already has nearly 20 costumes.

'I put him in a costume one day just for fun and it looked so cute I felt that I had to share it with everybody, added Christine.

Miss Look even made Albert dress like a character from Breaking Bad by putting him in goggles and a protective jacket. She then placed him on a pile of fake money next to a container with blue liquid

In one of the shoots Miss Look ventured to Hollywood Boulevard where she placed Albert on 'The Munchkins' star

Whereas some of the photos show Albert wearing full costumes, others picture him posing in just a hat

'My favourite is probably the Woody costume from Toy Story - it's so cute.

'I also like Obi Wan Kenobi from Star Wars and the little 101 Dalmatians costume he has.

'There's also a Breaking Bad costume which is really adorable.'

Despite her obsessiveness with turning Albert into the next big thing Christine has the full support of her friends and family.

She added: 'My friends and family love Albert - at first they were surprised that I wanted to dress him up in outfits, but they like all the attention that he's getting and they're really supportive.'

She said that some of the photos can take up to 45 minutes to take and require several different prop changes

When he is not dressing up Albert enjoys a quiet life and especially loves sitting in cardboard boxes

While Christine loves the success she has been threatened by online trolls who have talked of kidnapping Albert.

Christine said: 'It's always worrying to get messages like that but we just try to ignore them and carry on with what we are doing for Albert.

'That's our main goal.'
