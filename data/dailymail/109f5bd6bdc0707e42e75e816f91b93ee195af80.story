Paul Parkinson suffered a heart attack and died just days before the murder trial of his daughter Jayden

The father of a murdered girl whose body was found buried in someone else's grave in a cemetery has collapsed and died just days before the start of her alleged killer's trial.

Relatives said it was believed the stress of the murder and the forthcoming Crown Court case had led to 48-year-old Paul Parkinson suffering a fatal heart attack.

He was the estranged father of Jayden Parkinson who disappeared last December.

A massive police murder hunt culminated in the 17-year-old's body being found in a disturbed grave in a cemetery near her home in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

A post mortem examination on her body showed that she had been strangled.

On Friday, Jayden's former boyfriend, 22-year-old Ben Blakeley stands trial before a judge and jury, accused of murdering her. 

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is also to face trial accused of perverting the course of justice.

Mr Parkinson, who lived in Nelson, near Manchester, had travelled south for the start of the trial at Oxford Crown Court when he suddenly collapsed and died.

His brother Glen, Jayden's uncle, said he believed the stress of the trial contributed to his death.

He was staying in Folkstone, Kent and was due to travel up to Oxford for the start of Blakeley's trial next Friday. 

A post mortem examination was expected to be carried out on his body to establish the exact cause of his death.

Mr Parkinson had separated from Jayden's mother, Samantha Shrewsbury. He had travelled to Folkstone and was staying with relatives in the house where Jayden was born when he died suddenly on Thursday afternoon.

Ben Blakeley, from Reading, Berkshire, has already entered a guilty plea to the manslaughter of Jayden but denies her murder. He has also admitted perverting the course of justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service did not accept his plea and a full-scale jury trial is to be held. The jury is to be told he has already admitted manslaughter.

Following the plea hearing in March, Mr Parkinson wrote on Facebook: 'Can I just say thank you to all of you for your surport (sic). Just got to wait till June now for the outcome.'
