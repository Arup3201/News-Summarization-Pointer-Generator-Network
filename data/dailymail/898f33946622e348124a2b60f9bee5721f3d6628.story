Nick Clegg at Westminster School in 1984. He has called for all teachers who work full-time in free schools to have teaching certificates

Nick Clegg was mocked yesterday after it emerged that none of his own teachers would be allowed to teach in free schools under rules he wants to introduce.

The Deputy Prime Minister attended the prestigious Westminster School where, in common with other private schools, teachers are not required to hold teaching qualifications.

Yet Mr Clegg wants all teachers who work full-time in free schools to have teaching certificates, even if they have years of experience.

Yesterday he was confronted over how 
none of the teachers who propelled him to Cambridge and into a 
high-flying career would have been able to teach at a free school under 
his rules.

Mr
Clegg also provoked controversy by insisting that there should be 
different rules for independent schools because parents paid the fees 
and took ‘their chances’. Westminster currently charges £32,000 
annually.

LBC
Radio host Nick Ferrari asked Mr Clegg if he remembered his English 
teacher Jim Cogan – ‘a former Royal Marine who didn’t have the relevant 
piece of paper’.

‘I understand you were very close to him,’ Mr Ferrari said.

Mr
Clegg was asked about David Cook, who studied history and was in charge
of tuition to get pupils into Oxford and Cambridge, but also ‘didn’t 
have the piece of paper’.

His classics teacher Theo Zinn was also technically unqualified.

Mr Clegg said he remembered all of them, including Mr Cogan who ‘sadly died some years ago’.

He
added: ‘I’m amazed at anyone thinking it is a controversial statement 
to say that across 23,000 state-funded schools we should have some basic
quality standards which provide a guarantee if you like, a reassurance 
to parents in the years to come.’

But one Coalition MP, who did not want to be named, said Mr Clegg was adopting a ‘condescending’ tone.

Education Secretary Michael Gove believes headmasters at free schools and academies should have the same rights as those in private schools to hire untrained teachers if they are the best candidates

‘He seems to be suggesting that parents who send their kids to state schools need help in discerning between good and bad teachers, while those who send their kids private already know that so don’t need the guarantee,’ the MP said.

Mr Clegg has triggered a row with the Conservatives over the more relaxed rules for free schools.

Education Secretary Michael Gove believes headmasters at free schools and academies should have the same rights as those in private schools to hire untrained teachers if they are the best candidates.

Mr Clegg said: ‘Freedom does not mean anarchy. There’s laws that they have to abide by. Just because you’ve got qualified teacher status doesn’t mean you’re the greatest teacher ever. But it provides a certain basic quality standard.’

Asked whether his own intervention had caused a ‘Coalition crisis’, he told LBC: ‘I’m perfectly entitled to talk without being shouted down about my vision of the future of the schools system.’

Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘Labour has been very clear: All teachers must be qualified. So next week we will call a vote in Parliament to make sure teachers in our classrooms have the proper qualifications.

‘For Nick Clegg it’s always “believe what I say, not what I do”. Time and again his actions have shown that the Lib Dems cannot be trusted. So let’s see where he stands when we put him on the spot in Parliament next week.’

THEODORE ZINN: Fluent in Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian, the classicist could reel off vast tracts of Homer and Horace and would choose books he liked over what was required for the A-level curriculum.

His impressive physical presence matched his theatrical teaching style – when he struggled to get a class under control he would often burst into tears, shocking his pupils into silence.

He has written several books to help pupils pass exams in Latin.

JAMES ‘JIM’ COGAN: The English teacher and former deputy head of Westminster School was loved for his humorous approach to lessons which were filled with passionate debate.

Former pupils say he inspired them with his fondness for Shakespeare and knew poetry off by heart.

As a young man he served in Nigeria with the West African Frontier Force then read Greats at Corpus Christi, Oxford, before changing to English.

He taught English at Westminster for 35 years until 1999. He died aged 70 in 2007.

DAVID COOK: The history teacher was responsible for getting pupils into Oxford and Cambridge. He studied history at King’s College, London, and Lincoln College, Oxford, but had no official teaching qualification. He became housemaster, head of sport and head of history.

Mr Cook also went on to set up international branches of Britain’s top independent schools including Wellington College and Repton.

TRISTRAM JONES-PARRY: A ‘terrifying but brilliant’ maths teacher who went on to be headmaster at Westminster after Mr Clegg had left.

Former pupils described how he actually explained how maths worked rather than simply drilling formulae into them.

He retired at 58 and was prepared to offer his services to state schools – but was banned because he lacked the necessary teaching qualification.

RICHARD STOKES: The German teacher worked at Bedales before going on to teach at Westminster for 30 years. Last year he was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for ‘great service rendered to British-German relations’.

DAVID HEPBURNE-SCOTT: Known as the best physics teacher in the school, he could make pupils laugh by comparing thermodynamics theory with the making of a crème brulee. He was also a housemaster.
