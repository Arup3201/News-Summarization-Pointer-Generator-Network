Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, 24, could face assault and battery charges after fighting another inmate who was handcuffed at the time.

Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to the shooting murder of Odin Lloyd, 27, has been moved to a special isolation unit at the Briston County jail where he's being held.

He was moved after the fight in late February and must stay in the unit for 30 days.

According to NECN, Hernandez is residing in a similar cell to his previous one but has had several privileges revoked.

He spends 23 hours of the day in his cell which is furnished with a double bunkbed and stainless steel toilet. He takes all meals in his cell and cannot undertake any recreation unrestrained with handcuffs, waist-chain and leg irons.

He is allowed three showers a week and one hour of recreation per day.

Hernandez was not in cuffs at the time of the altercation with the other inmate.

The pair had been exchanging taunts in the days leading up to the incident.

Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told NECN that
 a full investigation is underway to discover why the two inmates were 
both out of their cells at the same time.

'I'm not happy that there may have been a breakdown in our system and our protocols,' he said.

The other inmate is not facing charges.

The sheriff's office has filed a complaint against Hernandez. A magistrate will decide if he will face a hearing.

Hernandez has been in prison since June 26 awaiting trial for the death of Odin Lloyd.

The former Patriots tight end is also being sued by the families of two men who were killed in a 2012 drive-by shooting outside a Boston nightclub.
