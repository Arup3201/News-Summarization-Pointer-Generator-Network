A 'devastated' Lindsey Vonn announced today that she will not be competing at February's Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, because of a setback in her recovery from a seriously injured knee.

Olympic legend Vonn, 29, underwent major surgery to repair her anterior cruciate ligaments 11 months ago - but frustratingly aggravated the same injury six weeks ago during a training session in Colorado and again in December in France.

In a statement this morning, the gold medal winning downhill skier announced her decision to withdraw from the games - robbing the event of arguably its biggest star.

'I am devastated to announce that I will not be able to compete in Sochi. I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.'

'I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February. On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold.

'Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially team USA!'

She took home two medals from the 2010 Vancouver Games, becoming the first American woman to win an Olympic gold in the downhill.

Vonn is also a four-time overall World Cup champion, the most recognized name in Alpine skiing â€” and, as it happens, the girlfriend of Tiger Woods.

Vonn last month suffered a worrying crash in the women's World Cup downhill.

In front of boyfriend Tiger Woods, she missed a gate at Val d'Isere as her troublesome right knee buckled under her and gave way.

The golfer and Vonn announced they were dating in March and Vonn became a fixture at Tiger's PGA tournaments.

Both have been married before.

Vonn wed 2002 Olympic skier Thomas Vonn in 2007. They separated in 2011 and finalized the divorce in January - one month before Lindsey Vonn's crash.

According to a statement released by her publicist, 'an MRI showed an MCL sprain, which coupled with the torn ACL, has made it impossible to stabilize her knee and be ready to safely ski again next month.'

Painstaking work: Vonn vowed to return to stronger and fitter to the slopes in time for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia and is pictured here in rehab following her career threatening injury in March 2013

Val d'Isere was the second step of Vonn's recovery from the ACL injury last February and she was expected to compete to win in Russia.

'Vonn will have surgery shortly and is expected to make a full recovery in time for the 2014/15 World Cup season and the 2015 World Alpine Ski Championships in Vail-Beaver Creek,' the statement from her publicist concluded and other's from the world of skiing chimed in with their support.

'In looking ahead, I have every ounce of confidence that Lindsey will be in the starting gate next World Cup season ready to compete," said Bill Marolt, president of the U.S. Skiing and Snowboard Association according to USA Today.

'She knows the hard work it takes to get to the top and still has significant goals to achieve in what has been an incredible career.'

The loss of Vonn to injury will also prove a huge disappointment to the corporate backers of these controversial games.

NBC has been heavily promoting the games with Vonn as the American face and is heavily sponsored by Red Bull, Rolex and Oakley - among others.

Her return to Olympic competition was expected to culminate in one of the stories of the games - with a win for Vonn the ultimate comeback tale.

'While Lindsey won't be in Sochi, we have a strong team that is well prepared to challenge,' Marolt said.

'The women's speed team is experienced with five athletes who have achieved World Cup podiums and a seasoned veteran in Julia Mancuso, who has won three Olympic medals in her career. Now is the time for those athletes to step up towards our best in the world vision.'

Painstaking: In March 2013 - skier Lindsey Vonn published this picture to Twitter that revealed the extent of her injury and subsequent surgery to fix the damage caused

Vonn, who was the first American 
woman to win downhill gold at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, is the 
most successful female skier in U.S. history.

Her decision to pull out of the games
 is especially upsetting for the four-time World Cup winner because of 
the painstaking work she has put in to repair her knee after a shocking 
tumble on the slopes of Schlamding, Austria, in February last year.

She
 suffered a torn ACL and tibial fracture and even then vowed to return 
stronger and better in time for February's Olympic Games in Sochi, 
Russia.

However, in 
November she suffered a setback when she partially tore one of her 
surgically repaired right knee during a training crash on Copper 
Mountain, Colorado.

'I don't think I was pushing myself too hard,' she told Matt Lauer on TODAY after her setback in November.

'It
 just was unfortunately a fluke accident. That's the risk you take when 
you're going 80-90 miles an hour down a mountain. That's just part of 
the job, but I've picked myself back up, and I'm trying as hard as I can
 to keep going. I'm working as hard as I can.'

And then she aggravated the injury again in a race at Val d'Isere, France on December 21 - putting the writing on the wall.

Before that terminal injury for her Olympic hopes, Vonn had returned to World Cup racing in the first week of December, finishing fifth and 11th in a pair of races in Lake Louise, Alberta.

`I know I can win again,'' she told reporters in Canada. `I'm ready for Sochi.'

Her victory in Vancouver turned her into an international superstar in the sport of alpine skiing.

She graced magazine covers, including the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition. In 2010, she was ranked on Maxim magazine's Hot 100.
