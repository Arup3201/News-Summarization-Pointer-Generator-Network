Auburn, strawberry blonde, red, whatever the shade of hair, thousands of redheads were present at today's international Redhead Day.

Ginger-haired people from all over the world gathered in the city of Breda, The Netherlands, for 'Roodharigendag' -  the annual day where everything beautiful about the flame-haired population is celebrated. 

There was music, a picnic, fashion shows and art exhibitions - without a smug brunette or blonde in sight.

It is celebrated every year on the first weekend in September, attracting people from a variety of countries including Britain, the United States, Australia and Germany.

The festival started in 2005 when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. He advertised for models and received 150 replies. Gradually over time, the festival has grown in popularity, with around 5,000 people attending the gatherings every year.
