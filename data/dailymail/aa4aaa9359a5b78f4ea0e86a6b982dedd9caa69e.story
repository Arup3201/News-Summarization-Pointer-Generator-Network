Having your lottery numbers come up should be the stuff dreams are made of, but what if they did - and then you were told your ticket wasn't valid?

This stomach-turning scenario appears to have happened to one unlucky lady from California.

Margit Arrobio from Pasedena, purchased five Powerball tickets at a local gas station.

Like so many others, she decided to take
a chance and play in the Powerball lottery on Wednesday when the 
jackpot stood at $360 million.

The next morning, Arrobio tuned into ABC's Good Morning America for the winning numbers and found out that her ticket matched all six.

Confusingly for her, the news was reporting that no winning ticket had been sold.

'I called my gas station where I bought the ticket and I said, 'I don't get it. I have every number and yet they say there's no winner,' Ms. Arrobio told KABC.

But the store that sold her the 
ticket of her dreams neglected to inform her that at 8pm (PDT) on Wednesday night, she was 
already too late to enter that evenings draw.

The numbers had already been announced.

Ms Arrobio said she was first shocked and then disappointed.

There have been tales of unlucky lottery losers before.

Spare
a thought for New York State worker Michael Kosko who missed out on a 
share of his workmates' $319million Mega Millions jackpot in March 2011.

He didn't join the syndicate that day because he 
didn't have two dollar bills for a ticket - and wouldn't let a friend 
lend it to him.

The IT worker from Albany refused to feel sorry for himself, summing up his bad luck in a remarkable understatement: 'It wasn't my day.'

Seven of his co-workers scooped $19.1million each after taxes when their lucky numbers came up.

And then there's the story of KraftMaid worker Edward Hairston, from Youngstown, Ohio.

Mr Hairston had chipped in to the office pool for eight years, but failed to pay his monthly dues when 22 members had their massive $99 million win in August 2011.

He had missed making the payment because he was on sick leave for three months due to a back problem.

He ended up suing his colleagues after he was told he was not going to get any of the prize.

A private settlement was reached.
