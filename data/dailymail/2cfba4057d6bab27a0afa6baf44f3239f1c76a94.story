We've seen some odd flavours of ice cream recently.

There's been olive oil from Ginger Comfort Emorium, watercress delight from Purbeck Ice Cream, and even a brussel sprout offering from London restaurant Vivat Bacchus.

But Britain has been beaten once again in the food stakes by the Japanese.

A few months ago Femail reported one Tokyo restaurant was serving a menu seasoned with fresh dirt.

And now, Kobe's Torimi (Bird) Cafe is serving a line of three ice creams modelled on breeds of small bird - java sparrow, parakeet and cockatiel.

Would YOU try some bird flavoured ice cream? One Japanese cafe thinks you should

Served at the Osaka Small Bird Expo in the Hanshin Department Store, Torimi Cafe sees visitors flock to be surrounded by 36 pet birds in their unique space.

The cafe say they use all natural ingredients which cost 'a little more than normal ice cream ingredients' to make their wacky dairy treats.

They were using the expo as a test run to see if the ice cream would sell well enough to recoup the costs, according to Rocket News 24.

If successful these ice creams would be sold at their shop in Kobe and through delivery.

Torimi Cafe initially announced: 'Once in your mouth, the aroma of a parakeet would spread intensely.'

If you're wondering how exactly the cafe found out what these cute birds taste like... read on for a run down of the three flavours.

The
 java sparrow is a small chubby bird which feeds on grains and seeds. In
 that spirit, you are treated to vanilla ice cream with grains mixed in.

As the ice cream melts in your mouth 
you might feel something squishy rolling around, just like a java 
sparrow on your tongue. That would be the marshmallows hidden inside.

According to Torimi Cafe: 'It’s the feeling of pressing the breast of a java sparrow into your mouth.'

Perhaps you could enjoy this tasty treat with your pet bird? The cafe hasn't confirmed it fit for bird consumption

Parakeets are known to be more lively
 and active birds and as such the mellow taste of the java sparrow ice 
cream is jazzed up with some honey and apple.

There are still some grains mixed in, but to a lesser extent.

As Torimi Cafe put it, 'it’s like 
eating some vanilla ice cream in one hand and then taking a whiff of a 
parakeet in your other hand.'

Cockatiel ice cream remains lively 
with the taste of honey-apple, but rather than grains, is mixed with 
larger pumpkin and sunflower seeds.

The effect is a rumbling and bouncy 
taste which, in the words of Torimi Cafe, is like 'when you’re sleeping 
with your mouth open and your cockatiel runs over your face and gets its
 leg in your mouth.'
