Gadgets including iPads have been hailed as modern day status symbols, researchers have found

If you own an iPad, a 50in TV and you shop at Waitrose or Marks & Spencer – congratulations.

They are among the status symbols by which success and wealth are judged today, according to a poll.

But don’t feel too satisfied. The survey highlighted many other items that are somewhat harder to attain, including a holiday home abroad and a Ferrari, preferably with a personalised number plate.

Designer watches, a house worth £577,921, a cleaner and a gardener are also regarded as status symbols by some.

And
when it comes to a holiday, to really show off your success it needs to
cost around £5,000 and be on a remote Indian Ocean resort or in a 
private Caribbean villa.

The
eclectic mix of items emerged in a poll of 2,000 adults which found 
that around one in seven Britons (14 per cent) have bought a status 
symbol simply to impress others or appear better-off than they are.

Worryingly, fewer than half used savings, with one in four putting the 
purchase on a credit card, and more than one in 20 taking out a loan.

Andy
Oldham, managing director at cashback site Quidco, which commissioned 
the research, said: ‘There was a time when people judged success solely 
on your home or job, but it seems there are many more modern items that 
help give a certain impression of you.

The report found that along with the car you drive and house you live in, modern day status symbols also include diamond jewellery, designer watches and a foreign holiday home (file picture)

‘Technology
has improved massively over the last few years and this is reflected in
the list with items such as 3D TVs, iPads and smartphones all 
featuring.

‘Even the 
supermarket you go to for your weekly shop can give others an idea of 
how successful you are.

'Material items go such a long way to showing you
are successful that it seems many are buying these status symbols, even
if they can’t really afford them.’
