A Brooklyn man who was falsely imprisoned for 25 years for a murder he didn't commit wants one million dollars for the every year the state kept him behind bars and away from his family.

Derrick Deacon, who walked free last year after new evidence surfaced in his case, has filed a $25 million lawsuit that he hopes will set a new precedent for how authorities handle investigations and force convictions.

The 58-year-old is undergoing therapy to help acclimate to the 'new world' and deal with the loss of family members, including his mother, who died when he was in prison.

Deacon was jailed the 1989 for the shooting death of a teenager during a robbery in a Flatbush apartment complex.

Quarter of a century lost: Brooklyn man Derrick Deacon, 58, spent 25 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit. After walking free in November after a retrial quashed his conviction, he is suing New York for $25 million for what happened to him

However at his retrial in 2012, a witness
 recanted her original testimony, saying police or district attorney 
investigators had threatened her.

Colleen Campbell had told investigators Deacon was not the man she saw fleeing in a stairwell after the shooting, but she was coached to give vague testimony at trial, with authorities threatening to take her children if she didn't cooperate, according to The New York Post.

'These people have to pay for every day they made me suffer behind the wall for no reason,' Deacon told The Post.

Deacon's retrial was granted after a Jamaican gang member came forward saying members of a rival gang had killed the victim, 16-year-old Anthony Wynn.

Then Campbell took back her statements.

'[Police] told Campbell that she was in trouble for leaving the children unattended and that the children would be taken away unless she accompanied them to the District Attorney's Office,' says the suit, filed by Deacon's defense attorney, Glenn Garber.

'Concerned about losing her children, and also afraid that the true killer would seek retribution against her, Campbell did what she was told and falsely testified at trial that she was unsure whether the person she saw was or was not Mr. Deacon.'

A Brooklyn Supreme Court jury in November deliberated just nine minutes before acquitting Deacon.

Once he was released, Deacon celebrated with a feast of chicken wings and chili at Tribeca's Mudville Saloon

Deacon is now seeing a therapist to cope with being back in what he calls 'the new world'.

Integral things like cellphones and internet were all created when he was in prison.

He recalled the bittersweet moment he heard the not-guilty verdict.

'I was excited but sad at the same time.

'Sad, in a way, about the one person that I really care about, my mom, my baby's mom and my aunts.

'They all died while I was in there. I missed seeing my kids grow up,' Deacon said, adding he would use any money he was awarded to help his family.

'I got kids, grandkids I want to send to college because I never had the opportunity to do that for my children.

'I have friends behind the wall still suffering, and I'd like to help them, too.'

A spokeswoman for the state attorney general declined to comment on the suit.
