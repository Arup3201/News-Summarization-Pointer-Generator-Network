An affluent cul-de-sac outside of Charlotte, North Carolina, has been left reeling after a poetry-loving 50-year-old shot dead his neighbors on Friday allegedly over a dispute over trees in his backyard.

Anthony Charles Hardy opened fire on his neighbors Daniel Thomas Kirchner, 42, and Gary Wade Stocks, 64, in the backyard of Kirchner's home, in front of Kirchner's wife and two young daughters and then later shot himself dead following a standoff with Cabarrus County SWAT team members stationed outside his own home.

Despite being described as a 'gentle spirit' by those who knew him, Hardy, who lived alone, had a history of aggressive behavior towards his neighbors and spent one year on probation for assaulting one resident prior to Kirchner or Stocks taking up residence.

Officials said 50-year-old Anthony Charles Hardy shot and killed neighbors Daniel Thomas Kirchner, 42, and Gary Wade Stocks, 64, in the backyard of Kirchner¿s house at 7791 Coachman Court

On Good Friday, police say that they received a phone call at 4 p.m. from Kirchner's wife Lisa to say that Hardy was firing a weapon in her backyard, shooting her husband and Stocks and that she had escaped inside with her two daughters.

Immediately after shooting his neighbors, Hardy ran to his own house and holed himself up there for over six hours, exchanging fire with SWAT officers at least twice, before shooting himself dead.

During the terrifying stand-off, the residents of Coachman Court, in the neighborhood of Windsor Forest, cowered in their homes as police units in tactical gear attempted to negotiate with Hardy while paramedics tried in vain to rescue Kirchner and Stocks.

While police have not yet offered any motive for the shocking shootings, some neighbors suggested to the Charlotte Observer that Hardy, who was known to be reclusive and secretive was angry that pine trees had been cut down behind his house.

The affluent cul-de-sac has been rocked by the apparently senseless murders following the shootings on Good Friday

Kirchner was president of the Windsor Forest homeowners association and Stocks was also a board member.

The trees were obstructing power lines behind Hardy's home and both victims were on the board that approved the removal of the trees.

However, neighbors such as Chris Duffell said there was no such feud.

Resident Judy Porson, who lives two doors away from the Stocks, said she didn’t believe there was any sort of argument between Hardy and his neighbors over the pine trees either.

Adding to the mysterious circumstances surrounding the shooting, Porson recalled how Hardy and Stocks had been chatting in recent weeks and that there was no sign of any ill-feeling.

'There was no argument, no animosity among them,' she said to The Charlotte Observer. 'Obviously he (Hardy) was disturbed. None of us can understand why he did this.'

Hardy's Linkedin and Facebook pages list him as the president of Anthony C. Hardy Enterprises, which says that he provides pharamcist staffing solutions.

Officers and SWAT teams rushed to the Coachman Court address on Friday afternoon after being called by Daniel Thomas Kirchner's wife, Lisa

One friend of Hardy's who used to meet him at his poetry meet-up group said that she had called him a month ago because he had stopped coming to the group.

Diana Engel said to WCNC.Com that she hadn't seen him in over a month. 'He said, I'm really struggling with something right now,' said Engel.

Hardy had never married and did not have children, but those who knew him through poetry and creative writing groups described him as an accomplished writer with a 'gentle spirit'.

David Radavich, the president of the Charlotte Writers Club said to WCNC.Com that Hardy had been chosen at least twice as one of the top poets among the groups 220 members.

Engle also said that she had known Hardy for seven-years and that he was a hunter and politically conservative.

Hardy's victim Daniel Thomas Kirchner was an insurance agent and the father of two young daughters.

Harrisburg, North Carolina Mayor Tim Hagler said that the community was devastated by the tragic and senseless shooting

Neighbors also revealed that Stocks had even called 911 on Hardy's behalf when he thought that he was having a heart attack - picking him up from the hospital later on.

Stunned neighbors recalled how Coachman Court was known for its block parties and family-orientated atmosphere.

One unidentified neighbor said, 'Dan (Kirchener) is a nice man. If you met in the aisle in the grocery store, he would be the guy that would move his cart so you could get to the shelf.

Speaking to the Charlotte Observer, he added that 'Gary (Stocks) was a really, really friendly guy. He'd always stop and say 'Hi'.

The neighborhood's residents said that the cul-de-sac was known for its community spirit and frequent block parties

Neighbors who have lived nearby to Hardy for more than ten-years revealed he frequently got into arguments about landscaping with the previous owner of Kirchner’s house.

Court records show Hardy was found guilty of assaulting that man in 2004.

And on Sunday, in the aftermath of the tragic shootings, Tim Hagler, the mayor of Harrisburg, issued a call for the community to pull together.

'We're like family so when one hurts, one family hurts, we all hurt,' said Hagler.

'The good thing about Harrisburg is we all pull together, and we're here for support.'
