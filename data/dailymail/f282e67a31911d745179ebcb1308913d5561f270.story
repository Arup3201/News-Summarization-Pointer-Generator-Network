Ultimo has unveiled a capsule collection of bras for fuller busts and has found the perfect person to help model them-founder Michelle Mone's daughter, Rebecca. 

Like mother, like daughter, the 22-year-old has showcased the new DD-G styles, designed to shape and empower the fuller busted woman. 

In a series of beautiful and sophisticated shots, Rebecca looks gorgeous showing off the new designs.

Rebecca says: 'I've grown up on photoshoots and surrounded by models and lingerie, so it wasn't too far out of my comfort zone and was a really empowering experience.

'I have always struggled to find good fitting underwear that's not ugly and bulky. 

'This new collection is so much better than anything I have ever seen on the market, and I'm really excited to be part of the launch campaign.'

Developed over 18 months, the new collection features three super-sleek products, including an everyday balcony bra, a sexy plunge bra and a 'wear 5 ways' multi-way bra – all available in black, white and nude. 

Built for a perfect fit on the body, each Ultimo DD-G product is completely seam free with wings reinforced with power mesh for extreme support.

Rebecca's mum Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, says, 'Of course, I had my doubts about involving Rebecca in a campaign given that she's my daughter, but she's a young woman now and has been so involved in the development of the new collection it made complete sense.

'I think she showcases the product beautifully and I'm really proud of her.'

Michelle added: 'The large-cup market is growing rapidly and, as one of the UK's biggest lingerie brands, we felt that it was high time we launched a range that catered for fuller busts.

'The new capsule collection features three incredible products – a t-shirt bra, a balcony bra and a strapless multi-way. Each style provides amazing support, extreme comfort, and encompasses your every curve without being bulky.'

The new Ultimo styles will be priced in line with Ultimo's A-D offering – at £27.00.

Michelle explains: 'Fuller bust bras are legitimately more expensive to produce, but we took the decision to put our customers first and absorb the costs elsewhere in the business – and I'm thrilled. 

'There will be no price differentiation, which is exactly how it should be.'

Adding to the new core D-G products available in white, nude and black, Ultimo will unveil a range of fuller bust fashion styles in January 2015, as part of their Spring Summer 2015 collection.

The new  DD-G products are available from Next, Littlewoods, Tesco, ASOS, Figleaves and Ultimo.
