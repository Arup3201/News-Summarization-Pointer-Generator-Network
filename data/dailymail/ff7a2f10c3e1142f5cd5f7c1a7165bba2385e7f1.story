A thank you letter written by slaves from the Amistad Rebellion in 1841 to former President John Quincy Adams, who defended them in court and helped set them free, has been published.

The letter was released by the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University to mark the 175th anniversary of the rebellion.

Adams was 74 when he decided to represent 53 Africans and prevent them from being sold into slavery by Spain.

Ally: Adams stood up for the Amistad slaves in front of the Supreme Court in Connecticut, which ruled that they were free to return to Africa

The letter contains messages from four of the 53.

One wrote: ‘Dear friend, we write this to you because you plead with the Great Court to make us free and now we are free and joyful we thank the Great God.

‘We will tell all our friends about you and we will say to them Mr. Adams is a great man and he plead for us and how very glad we be and our friends will love you very much because you was a very good man and oh how joyful we shall be.’

The Africans had been kidnapped in Sierra Leone and were heading by ship in 1839 to Spain via Cuba when they decided to make a bid for freedom.

After switching ships in Cuba to La Amistad, a slave called Cinque led an uprising on July 1 against their captors. Several were killed in the ensuing violence.

The ship then crashed in Long Island, where they were jailed. A US court eventually set them free. 

Another said: ‘Wicked people want to make us slaves but the great God who has made all things raise up friends for Mendi people he give us Mr. Adams that he may make me free.’

The ship then crashed in Long Island and the Africans placed in custody. Spain laid claim to them, desperate to put them back in chains and the U.S government accused them of piracy and murder.

But Adams stood up for them at court in Connecticut, which ruled that they were free to return to Africa.

Tragically, some died while awaiting trial and many of them perished on the journey home.

The slaves’ story was told on the big screen in the hit 1997 Spielberg movie Amistad, starring Morgan Freeman, Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins.

Farmington. May 5th 1841.
