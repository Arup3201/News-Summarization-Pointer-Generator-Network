Lady Thatcher’s final journey will take her from the House of Commons, the political home she bestrode for more than three decades, to a service at St Paul’s Cathedral.

Details of the ceremonial funeral with military honours are understood to have been mapped out in talks between government officials and Baroness Thatcher more than five years ago.

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
and Nancy Reagan, wife of her closest ally US President Ronald Reagan, 
are expected to lead a list of international mourners.

MAILONLINE AND DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD

If you believe Lady Thatcher deserves a state funeral, and want the Government to know, just sign this online petition or print out the form below and send it to us. We will pass it to the Prime Minister's office at 10 Downing Street

Every living Prime Minister – Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron – plus the Cabinet and shadow cabinet will also attend the service, which is expected on either Wednesday or Thursday next week.

Yesterday, as flags flew at half-mast from London to Port Stanley in the Falklands and Washington DC, well-wishers lay tributes at the Iron Lady’s Belgravia home in Central London.

The evening before her funeral, Lady Thatcher’s coffin will rest in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster. There will be a short service following its arrival.

On the day itself, the streets will be cleared of traffic and the coffin will travel by hearse to the Church of St Clement Danes, the RAF Chapel, on the Strand.

At the church the coffin will be 
transferred to a gun carriage drawn by horses of the King’s Troop of the
 Royal Horse Artillery, the Queen’s ceremonial Saluting Battery which is
 stationed at Woolwich in South-East London.

Spontaneous tribute: Carrying bouquets, wreaths and poster pictures, well-wishers arrived at Lady Thatcher's home in Belgravia, central London, within an hour of the news of her death being broadcast

The
 funeral cortege will pass up Whitehall, through Trafalgar Square, along
 the Strand, round Aldwych and then up Ludgate Hill to St Paul’s.

Remembered: Lady Thatcher's final journey will take her from the House of Commons to St Paul's

Serving
 members of all three Armed Forces will line the route along with an 
expected throng of tens of thousands of members of the public.

When the procession reaches the steps of St Paul’s it will be met by another military guard of honour and Chelsea pensioners.

Lady
 Thatcher’s family yesterday urged well-wishers not to send flowers but 
to send donations to the Royal Hospital in Chelsea where the pensioners 
live.

After the official funeral ceremony there
 will be a separate private family event as Lady Thatcher is cremated in
 Mortlake, South West London.

The costs of the funeral will be shared by the Government and Lady Thatcher’s estate.

Government departments like the Ministry of Defence will pick up the tab for their own contributions. It was estimated that the Queen Mother’s funeral cost £6million.

A No 10 spokesman said: ‘All the arrangements being put in place are in line with the wishes of Lady Thatcher’s family.’

Friends say the former PM told them she did not wish her body to lie in state.

Family spokesman Lord Bell said: ‘She specifically did not want a state funeral…and she didn’t want a fly-past as she thought that was a waste of money – somewhat in character you might think.’
