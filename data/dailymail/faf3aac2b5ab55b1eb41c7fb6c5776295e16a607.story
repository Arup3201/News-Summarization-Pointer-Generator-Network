It was smiles all round for Arsenal players in training on Monday, after a perfect Premier League weekend.

Goals from Mesut Ozil and Danny Welbeck, followed by an Aly Cissokho own goal, ensured three points for Arsenal against Aston Villa while Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City, Chelsea, Everton and Manchester United all failed to win.

Arsenal welcome Southampton in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday, where Arsene Wenger is expected to rest his big guns in favour of fringe and youth players.

Wenger took the training session on the London Colney training pitch on Monday morning, and players seemed in high spirits in the lead-up to Tuesday's game.

German forward Lukas Podolski and Alexis Sanchez were happy to pose for pictures during a break in the session, with the former even practising his boxing technique.

Colombia keeper David Ospina was put through his paces ahead of what is likely to be his Arsenal debut, while Joel Campbell and Tomas Rosicky look set to start their first games of the season when Wenger makes wholesale changes for his side's Capital One Cup match.

Arsenal welcome Tottenham to the Emirates in a north London derby next Saturday, and Ozil is expected to be one of a number of big games to be rested ahead of that.

Midfielder Abou Diaby is fit again after numerous injuries have stunted his career, and he is likely to start on Tuesday night.

Youngster Daniel Crowley, who signed a professional contract in August - the day after his 17th birthday - also trained with the first team and could make his Arsenal debut. 

Another academy success trained, in the tall figure of Ainsley Maitland-Niles - the England U17 winger who is trying to make an impact on the first team after a successful season in the youth set-up.  

The League Cup is the one domestic trophy that has eluded Wenger during his time in the Arsenal hot-seat, and after 18 years the Frenchman will look to change that this season.

Midfielder Jack Wilshere tweeted: 'Good session ahead of our Capital One Match....have good and bad memories of this competition, let's make some more good ones! #AFC #Gooners'.

Wilshere scored his first Arsenal goal against Sheffield United in the League Cup in 2008 but was part of the side who were shocked in the 2011 final by Birmingham City.
