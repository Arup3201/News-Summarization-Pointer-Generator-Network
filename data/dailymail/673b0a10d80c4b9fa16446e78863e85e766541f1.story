England will play the fourth one-day international of their forthcoming Sri Lanka tour a day later than initially scheduled.

The fourth match of seven, at Colombo's Premadasa Stadium, has been put back from Saturday December 6 to Sunday December 7.

Sri Lanka Cricket has informed the England and Wales Cricket Board of the switch, necessary because of religious observance of Poya Day on December 6.

The preceding ODI, in Hambantota, will take place as scheduled on December 3 but has had a reserve day added on December 4.

There will no longer be a reserve day possible for the fourth match.
