The 28-year-old son of a master mariner has been charged with high-range drink driving after crashing his 29-foot yacht into rocks while boating with friends.

The pilot, named by Nine News as Scott Biffin - the son of former Sydney Harbour pilot John Biffin, was allegedly three times over the legal limit when his boat became stranded at Balmoral Beach on Sydney's Lower North Shore.

On Monday police confirmed they have charged a man after officers from the Marine Area Command received reports that a motorised and sail yacht had hit rocks on Rocky Point at about about 7.30pm on Sunday.

'On arrival officers located a yacht grounded at the head of Rocky Point,' police said.

'Police were told that the yacht had run out of fuel and another vessel was assisting, when the yacht ran aground.

'The pilot of the yacht, a 28-year-old man, received minor injuries while getting off and was treated by Ambulance Paramedics,' they added.

Four other passengers, two women and two men, were on board the boat at the time but they were uninjured.

Joel Freeland from Boat Assist 24 told Nine News: 'He said there were some very pretty ladies on the vessel.'

Scott's father John Biffin has been a Master Mariner since 1968, a First Class Pilot from 1980, becoming Senior Pilot, Sydney Ports Corporation, from 2004-2007.

He is heavily involved in organising major maritime events centred on Sydney Harbour, including the annual Australia Day celebrations.

Police from Harbourside Local Area Command arrested the pilot and took him to North Sydney Police Station.

He returned an alleged reading of 0.165 and was charged with operate vessel with high range PCA, to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on Monday 27 October 2014.

Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings called it a disappointing start to the boating season

The boat was towed back out to sea on Monday 

Inspector Shari Allison said: 'Don't drink and drive your boats. This guy has got a whole lot of hurt now not only with the damage to his boat but he's going to have to appear in court.' 

Marine Area Commander, Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings, said this incident is a disappointing start to the boating season.

'Operation Vikings Marine began on Saturday (4 October 2014) and will continue today to enforce maritime laws, conduct safety checks, inspect size and bag limits of fish, check boat licences and conduct random breath tests.'

'It is really disappointing to see this type of behaviour and police will continue to be out in force to keep everyone on our waterways safe,' Det Supt Hutchings said.
