Patrick Reed will take a two-shot lead into the final round of the Quicken Loans National at Congressional on Sunday after carding a third-round 71.

Despite struggling with his short game the American, who was one of four leaders at the halfway stage, birdied the fourth and fifth but undid his hard work by recording bogeys on the seventh and eighth.

He dropped a shot on the 14th but reclaimed it with a birdie on the 16th to finish on six under.

Reed has missed the cut in five of his last seven tournaments and is looking for his third PGA victory of the season after triumphs at the WGC-Cadillac Championship and the Humana Challenge.

He faces stiff competition from Noh Seung-yul, who got home in 66 shots - the lowest-scoring round of the day.

The South Korean was joined on four under by Freddie Jacobson of Sweden and Australia's Marc Leishman, who posted 71 and 73 third-round scores respectively.

American trio Richard Lee, Shawn Stefani and Ben Martin are a further shot behind, and are joined by England's Justin Rose, who is the highest placed Briton.

Defending champion Bill Haas is tied for 11th after a par round of 71. He is joined by fellow Americans Ricky Barnes, Brendan Steel and Brendon Todd on two under.

Australia's Oliver Goss, who along with Reed, Barnes and Leishman led at the halfway stage, had a day to forget in carding a five-over 76, a round which included five bogeys and one double bogey.
