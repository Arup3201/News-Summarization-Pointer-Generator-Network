'Gobsmacked': David Hatton was banned from buying a Jaguar because he is a motor trader

A second-hand car trader was told by a Jaguar dealership that he was not allowed to buy a new £65,000 F-Type from them - despite agreeing to the deal the day before.

David Hatton, 42, said he was forced to leave the showroom with 'his tail between his legs' during the embarrassing incident.

The father believes Jaguar bosses fear motor traders will sell on their vehicles for a quick profit, like 1980s sitcom character Arthur Daley.

Daley featured in Minder, a British comedy about London's criminal underworld, and famously drove a silver Jaguar.

Mr Hatton, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, was hoping to purchase the classic car for personal use only.

The married father-of-two went to the Jaguar dealership, HA Fox, of Nottingham, last week with his wife Stacey, 49, with the intention of buying a second-hand model, priced at around £58,000.

But he was soon persuaded to go for a new car and agreed a deal with a salesman after hours of negotiation.

He told them he would come back the following day to finalise the deal and place a deposit on the vehicle.

But when he returned to the showroom with his brother, he was told that the dealership's manager had called off the agreement and insisted they would never sell him a car.

Mr Hatton said: 'We were absolutely gobsmacked. We literally couldn't believe it.

'There was a bit of nervous laughter and we basically had to leave the showroom with our tails between our legs.

'When they first broke it to us, there was some discussion about how they could potentially sell my wife the vehicle if she came with her own insurance.

'She wouldn't be allowed to use my motor trader insurance - which would have been a big hassle.

'We actually reluctantly agreed to this - but then the salesman went away again and came back to say the manager had decided we couldn't even do this. 

'The whole time he was sitting in his office about 12ft away and never came out to speak to us himself.

'The car was for personal use. The cars I sell are fairly run-of-the-mill and priced between £3,000 and £5,000.' 

Mr Hatton stocks around 25 vehicles at his used car dealership Hattons of Spondon, and has been trading cars for 25 years.

Speaking to The Sun, he added: 'Poor old Arthur would be turning in his grave. He was famed for his Jag back in the day when the firm was struggling. Now it seems he would be sent packing.'

Jaguar dealer HA Fox refused to comment.  

Arthur Daley, played by George Cole, was one of the stars of the hit sitcom, which ran for ten series between 1979 and 1994.

Daley was seen as a a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous used car salesman who famously drove a silver Jaguar XJ6.
