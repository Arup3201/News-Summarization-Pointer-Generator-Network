A woman died after being stung more than 500 times when her car hit a bee hive. 

The swarm attacked the 23-year-old Brazilian woman after her car left the road in a thunderstorm on Saturday night. 

Doctors in Rosario do Sul city, Brazil, said the woman may not have known she was allergic to bee stings.

Police believe she lost control of the car during the storm and her car hit the hive which had been left under a tree by beekeepers.

Witnesses saw her running away from the car after the crash in an attempt to escape the bees. 

Federal Police named the woman as military police trainee Mariana Lucher. She was buried on Sunday.

Beekeepers know that individual swarms not only have their own group 'personalities' - some are more aggressive than others, for example - but also that they can behave differently depending on the weather.

Hot and humid conditions often make bees bad tempered, while mild and sunny weather tends to encourage calm behaviour.

Though European bees rarely attack people, the same is not true elsewhere.

A hybrid strain of bee known for its aggressiveness have been spreading north from Mexico since the Seventies

In the U.S., 'Africanised' honey bees, a hybrid strain known for its aggressiveness, have been spreading north from Mexico since the Seventies.

The Africanised bee was the result of experimental breeding carried out in Brazil in the Fifties.

It was designed to produce a strain that was better adapted to the Tropics than common European strains, such as the Italian honey bee, Apis mellifera ligustica.

Unfortunately, combining the genes of Tanzanian and European insects produced a bee that, while productive, could be extremely defensive and even aggressive.

Honey bees are considered to be potentially dangerous across much of the Tropics.

The main reason bee attacks can be so serious is the way the stings encourage further assaults. 

When a honey bee stings, it drenches the site with chemicals called pheromones, which send a message to the other bees, encouraging them to sting the same spot.

The stings will be concentrated in sensitive areas such as the nose and eyes.

When a honey bee stings you, the barbed protuberance through which the poison is delivered rips away the last segment of the animal's abdomen.

This means that the bee dies of severe haemorrhaging within minutes.
