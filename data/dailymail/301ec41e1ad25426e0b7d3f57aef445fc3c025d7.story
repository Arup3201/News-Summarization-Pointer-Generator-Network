Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is already developing into a genuine star at Arsenal, and the England midfielder is now looking to legends of the game to improve his play.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, the only Gunners player to feature in all of the club's 25 games this season, has been a shining light in a disappointing start for Arsene Wenger's side.

And the 21-year-old attributes his improvement to the experience of watching some of the great players, including club legend Thierry Henry.

Arsenal's record goalscorer played alongside Oxlade-Chamberlain during his return to the club in 2012, and the Englishman believes he learned a lot about the game from working with the World Cup winner.

Henry gave the young man 'endless amounts of advice', but it was by watching him train the Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up the most. 

'You know when you see typical Henry, coming in from the left and you think "He is just going to open up here and curl it in the bottom corner and score like he always does",' he told The Telegraph.

'What I remember is when he missed one of those chances in training. I've never seen anyone be so angry with himself and disappointed. 

'The first thing he would says was "Titi, come on!" It was just to himself out loud. It made you realise why he used to score them constantly.'

With Henry having retired, and set for a possible coaching role at Arsenal, Oxlade-Chamberlain has been watching other stars of European football to improve his game.

As the England international moves inside into a central midfield role he has been studying the likes of Andres Iniesta, Steven Gerrard and Blaise Matuidi, but it is Holland legend Wesley Sneijder who seems to have particularly caught his eye. 

Wesley Sneijder is among the midfield stars of European football that Oxlade-Chamberlain has been watching

The Arsenal star described Sneijder as 'one of the best', and says he would love to have a similar career

'I think he is one of the world's best,' said Oxlade-Chabmerlain. 'He doesn't play as deep but he finds really good pockets in midfield, he turns and, whether he is going to shoot, pass or run with the ball, he causes problems. 

'I would love to get to there, to have the career that he has had. Players like that you watch.'
