All eyes are on Wall Street today after ailing world markets started to rally following a late surge in New York last night.

The Dow Jones was sinking in value yesterday because of more turmoil in the Eurozone but in its final hour it ended up 153 points after a toxic bank was told they would get a taxpayer-funded bailout.

Dexia will now be propped up by France and Belgium because of its exposure to Europe's most indebted countries.

The two nations stepped in to insure every penny of its deposits after its value was slashed by a huge 22 per cent causing more dramatic falls across European markets.

As New York was still trading when the news broke the Dow Jones rebounded.
The Dow closed with a gain of 153.41, or 1.4 per cent, to 10,808.71.

This morning's markets have followed 
Wall Street's lead with London's FTSE 100 up 1.5 per cent at 5,022 
points, while Frankfurt's DAX index was 2.5 per cent higher and Paris's 
CAC-40 index up 2.1 per cent this morning.

Banks
have also rebounded with Dexia rising 8.6 per cent, while BNP Paribas 
gained 7.4 per cent and Deutsche Bank added 5.6 per cent.

The protests on Wall Street are expected to swell with reinforcements as more groups head towards Manhattan today.

Among the hundreds more planning to join the clamour are the liberal group MoveOn.org and community organisations like the Working Families Party and United NY.

The growing crowd will also include members of the Chinatown Tenants Union and the Transit Workers Union, signalling that the protest is showing no signs of losing steam.

Meanwhile, organisers have called for students at college campuses across the nation to walk out of class in protest at 2pm.

'I think they're capturing a feel of disempowerment, feeling like nobody is listening to them,' said Camille Rivera, executive director of United NY.

'What do you do when no one is listening to you? You speak up, you take action.'

US banks have been engulfed by the meltdown in the eurozone, with the cost of insuring debt for Wall Street titans Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs rising to levels not seen since the height of the credit crisis in October 2008.

'Right now fear is trumping fundamentals and people are buying on nothing more than rumours,' said Mark Lamkin, head of Lamkin Wealth Management.

'It's not business risk that the market is concerned with, it's systemic risk. If there truly is a solution to Europe's problems, then we'll set the stage for a nice rally.'

'Europe is the centre point of all of this,' said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management.

'The big fear in the market is that company earnings are not sustainable and that Europe's problems are going to spread into the US banking system.'

The recent levels of volatility provoked Morgan Stanley’s chief executive James Gorman into emailing staff on Monday morning to reassure them that ‘an enormous amount of confusion and misinformation’ was circulating about the bank and its possible vulnerability to the eurozone.

Deutsche Bank, once seen as an impregnable bulwark of financial stability in Europe, yesterday issued a profit warning, blaming turbulent markets and bigger charges on Greek sovereign debt.

It said it will write down another €250m of Greek debt in the third quarter of this year, on top of €155m in the second quarter, sending its shares down more than 6 per cent in early trading.

The bank, which still expects to make a profit albeit lower than its original €10bn target, is to cut around 500 jobs at its corporate banking and securities division, with some staff to be shed in the City of London.

Brussels-based Dexia was in perilous danger as it has around €4.8bn of loans to Greece.

Now is 
expected to split itself up into a ‘good bank’ and a ‘bad bank’ along 
the lines of the restructuring of Northern Rock in the UK, with support 
from the French and Belgian authorities, both of which hold stakes 
following a bailout in 2008.

'Bank shares have become uninvestible,’ 
says one observer. ‘There is some trade by the boys with the black 
boxes, hoping to take advantage of short-term price movements, but 
no-one in their right minds would buy on the fundamentals.’

Italy’s credit rating was slashed last night as the eurozone debt crisis threatened to spiral out of control.

Moody’s cut Italy’s status by three notches from Aa2 to A2 and warned further downgrades could follow.

The ratings agency blamed a ‘material increase’ in borrowing costs for eurozone countries with high levels of debt.

Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, pictured, tried to brush off 
the downgrade and said his country would hit its budget targets.

Borrowing
costs in Italy have soared on doubts that Mr Berlusconi will be able to
push through harsh austerity measures to tackle the country’s debts.

Further problems were also caused yesterday by the ongoing problems in Greece, which caused fear to tear through financial markets worldwide as European politicians again failed to agree a deal to prop up Greece’s bankrupt economy.

The slump came as George Osborne joined other EU finance ministers for crisis talks in Luxembourg.

In a highly unusual move, European ministers had sent their officials out of the room while they had a frank discussion on the deal.

But they still failed to thrash out a deal that will satisfy the markets.

A decision on whether or not to give Athens the next £7billion tranche of emergency funds, agreed under the first Greek bailout, was delayed until next month.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the 17-nation group of Euro members, said that Greece can survive until mid-November before it receives the next tranche. The funds were initially expected to be released this month.

But Mr Juncker indicated that the EU finance ministers are trying to revise the terms of the bailout deal they reached in July so that private banks now take a greater hit on Greek debt.

This has been made worse as Greek civil servants were today staging a 24-hour strike, paralysing the public sector in a protest against deeper austerity measures as the government struggles to avoid a catastrophic default.

Air traffic controllers joined the industrial action, grounding all flights to and from Greek airports.

State hospitals were operating with emergency staff, while lawyers, school teachers and tax officers also joined the walkout.

Public transport workers were holding work stoppages in the morning and evening, and demonstrations were planned later in the day.

Civil servants are protesting over plans to suspend about 30,000 staff on partial pay, part of new cutbacks that come on top of salary and pension cuts.

Greece is relying on international bailout loans to prevent default.
