Sir Bobby Charlton’s former agent Ray Whelan has been bailed from Brazilian prison following his arrest for allegedly helping illegal World Cup ticket sales.

Whelan, a director of MATCH Services — a subsidiary company of FIFA’s ticket and hospitality partners Byrom — spent a night in the Rio cells after been seized in his room at the Copacabana Hotel.

Whelan, 64, is accused of facilitating touting at the tournament by giving access to tickets which were re-sold at vastly inflated prices, which is illegal in Brazil.

Police confiscated 82 tickets for the semi-finals and final, along with Whelan’s computer, mobile phone and other documents. Yet he will continue to work on World Cup business having being released after handing over his passport.

Whelan had been due to be transferred to the notorious Bangu prison but his lawyers secured a last-minute bail order at a cost of $5,000.

Brazil police’s Operation Jules Rimet team, investigating ticket abuse, claim Whelan was heard in tapped phone calls negotiating ticket prices with Algerian national Lamine Fofana — suspected ringleader of serial ticket touting at World Cups.

After Whelan’s release, a spokesman said: ‘MATCH have complete faith that the facts will establish that he has not violated any laws.

‘MATCH will continue to fully support all police investigations, which we firmly believe will fully exonerate Ray. In the meantime he will continue to work on our operational areas of responsibility.’

FIFA have worked closely with MATCH’s parent company Byrom since 1986. They have rights until 2023 for World Cup travel, tickets, hospitality, IT and accommodation from FIFA.

Byrom insisted last night that Whelan was involved in MATCH’s accommodation arm, not tickets or hospitality. It is possible he was helping kick-start a late sale of hospitality packages.

MATCH paid a guarantee of around £150million to FIFA for the rights to sell corporate hospitality at the 2010 and 2014 tournaments.

From more than three million tickets for the tournament, 445,500 were allocated to MATCH Hospitality with unused tickets returned to FIFA to be made available to the public.

But police estimated last week that touts were making around £300,000 per game by re-selling tickets on the black market.

MATCH said Fofana’s company Atlanta Sportif Management and three other companies — two of them MATCH Hospitality agents — had their remaining World Cup tickets blocked after some of their allocation ended up with touts.

Marcos Kac, the prosecutor in charge of the case, told Sao Paulo newspaper Estadao that the decision to release Whelan was ‘absurd’ and added: ‘We are all very upset.’
