The husband of Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell's new girlfriend has revealed he is divorcing her over her relationship with the paedophile suspect.

Desmond Fouche, 33, from Johannesburg, South Africa, told of the 'torture' he has endured since his wife Blanca, 31, left their home and flew to England with their two sons five months ago.

Le Vell, 48, faces trial in September after denying 19 sex charges, including six counts of raping a child, six allegations of indecently assaulting a child and seven counts of sexual activity with a child.

Heartbroken: Desmond Fouche with his wife Blanca, who he has revealed that he has started divorce proceedings against after learning of her relationship with soap star and paedophile suspect Michael Le Vell

Mr Fouche told the Daily Star how he 
had planned to join his wife in the UK but said she broke off their 
relationship via text message after a series of rows.

It was then that he discovered she had begun a relationship with Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster in Coronation Street.

Le Vell has been written out of the soap pending the outcome of his child sex trial.

Mr Fouche last night told how he had 
started divorce proceedings against his estranged wife, citing 
'irreconcilable differences'.

The couple, who met on Facebook, have been married since 2009 and have three-year-old and a two-year-old together.

'This has been very hard for me to 
bear,' he told the Star. 'My wife has left me and taken my kids halfway 
across the world, and is now with a guy facing very serious 
allegations.'

It is just over a fortnight since Le 
Vell appeared in court under his real name, Michael Turner, to deny a 
string of child sex offences.

The star answered 'not guilty' to each
of the individual charges as they were put to him by the clerk during 
the brief hearing at Manchester Crown Court.

The alleged offences relate to one complainant and all took place between 2001 and 2010.

Mrs Fouche, who is originally from 
Chile, reportedly met the father of two, who divorced his wife Janette 
last year, while staying with a friend who lives near him in Hale, an 
upmarket suburb of Manchester.

It emerged on Tuesday that she had 
been forced to close her Facebook account after suffering online abuse 
from relatives of her husband after news of her relationship with the 
actor broke.

She said of her relationship with the soap star: ‘I’ve liked him from a distance for a long time.

‘I’ve been seeing him for a few weeks. I always go to his place and I’ve been to the pub with him.

‘We’ve held hands and walked down the 
street, we’ve been careful, but we’ve not been hiding. It’s just that 
there’s been no photographers here. I don’t want to say  anything that 
might upset him. He’s told me not to say anything.’

Mrs Fouche added: ‘I go to his house 
or we meet up in The Railway. He has a lot of friends. He’s a lucky man.
I don’t want to say anything that will upset Michael.’

The actor declined to discuss their relationship, saying: ‘She’s a neighbour and a friend. That’s all I’m going to say.’

Mr Fouche said he has been having a 
'terrible time' since his wife left. The IT expert explained that he was
having difficulty finding work had been hoping to join her and search 
for a job in the UK.

'I am just hoping that Blanca
will begin to see sense so we can sort out some proper access,' he said. 'It has been torture not to see my sons.'

Le Vell, from Hale, Cheshire, was 
first arrested in September 2011 and questioned over child sex 
allegations but the matter was later dropped.

However in January, the Crown 
Prosecution Service said it was in the public interest to charge him 
with the current offences following a review of evidence.

Le Vell is on bail on condition he 
surrenders his passport, does not contact named witnesses and does not 
have unsupervised contact with any child under 14.

The father of two, originally from 
Manchester, is one of TV's most famous faces after playing garage owner 
and mechanic Kevin Webster for the past 30 years.

A Coronation Street press officer refused to comment.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
