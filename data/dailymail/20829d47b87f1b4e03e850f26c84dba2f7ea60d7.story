Sickening: Will Self claims the British love of food is well past its sell-by date

Novelist Will Self has blasted Britain's pre-occupation with gourmet cuisine, celebrity chefs and TV food programmes.

Self, author of novels such as The Book of Dave and How the Dead Live, wrote his withering assessment of Britain's love of shows like Come Dine With Me and Great British Bake-off in a blog on the BBC website called The British Vomitorium.

He said: 'It is, surely, undeniable that in the past 30 years we have, as a nation, been transformed from a culinary backwater - a stagnant reach in which floated the occasional soggy meat pie or waterlogged cabbage - into a foodie's paradise.

'What I think we should all do is throw up our very obsession with food itself, and enter the new year purged and able to forge a new relationship with whatever we happen to find on our plates.

'Once upon a time our High Streets were perhaps home to a chippie, a Chinese and an Indian.

'But now, even the most desultory and cloned shopping zone in the most provincial of towns will boast five, 10 or 15 eateries, all jostling for business with their exotic offerings.'

However, Self says it is people's desire to be seen as middle class that drives their culinary endeavours.

He said: 'Now we find ourselves in a society in which the majority of people identify themselves as being middle class, but this ascription owes more to digestion than it does to acculturation, let alone occupation.

'Under the new dispensation, it was 
no longer necessary to read Boccaccio, only munch on focaccia, just as 
you needn't trouble yourself with listening to Saint Saëns when it was 
so much easier to drink Côte de Beaune.

'Surely,
much of the managerial work undertaken by these new middle classes 
consists in the running of those self-same food outlets where they too 
chow down.

'Once the working classes were in chains, now they're in chain restaurants.'
