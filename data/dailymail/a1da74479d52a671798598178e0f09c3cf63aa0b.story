David Cameron will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election, Vince Cable has declared.

The Lib Dem Business Secretary said the target was ‘impractical’ and the Prime Minister ‘almost certainly won’t achieve’ it by 2015.

His intervention could spark a new round of Coalition bloodletting – and comes only weeks after he accused Mr Cameron of behaving like Enoch Powell.

Warning: Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) has declared that David Cameron (right) will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election. He deemed the target 'impractical' and 'unachievable' by 2015

Revelation: Mr Cable made his remarks in a BBC2 documentary about immigration, to be aired tonight. The programme features a poll showing that more than three-quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced

However, it also risked backfiring by exposing how out of touch the Lib Dems are with public opinion on the issue.

Mr Cable made his comments in the documentary The Truth About Immigration, to be aired tonight on BBC2.

The programme released a poll showing that more than three-quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced, and more than half want them to be cut ‘a lot’.

It would be better for Britain to be poorer but with fewer immigrants, Nigel Farage claimed today.

The
 UK Independence Party leader said he said he would ‘rather we weren’t 
slightly richer’ if it means allowing more people into the country to 
work and create jobs.

But he
 also revealed his party does not have an official policy on 
immigration, although he spent ‘many hours’ yesterday discussing it.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 
‘The fact is that if people come to this country from Eastern Europe and
 they’re earning minimum wage, they’re getting tax credits, possibly 
child tax credits, child benefit, housing benefit, and this so far has 
been the undiscussed part of this. So I question the economics.

‘But if you said to me: “Would you 
want to see over the next ten years a further 5million people come into 
Britain and if that happened we’d all be slightly richer?” I would say: 
actually, do you know what I’d rather we weren’t slightly richer.

‘I’d
 rather we had communities that felt more united and I’d rather have a 
situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance 
of getting a job.

‘So yes, I do think the social side of this matters more than pure market economics.’

Mr Cable said it was ‘not sensible to have an arbitrary cap’ on net migration – because many elements which make up the target cannot be controlled.

He said: ‘So it involves British people emigrating – you can’t control that. It involves free movement within the European Union – in and out.

‘It involves British people coming back from overseas.

‘So setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful, it almost certainly won’t achieve the below 100,000 level the Conservatives have set, so let’s be practical about it.’ 

‘The idea it should come down to 100,000 is something the Liberal Democrats have never signed up to because we simply regard it as impractical.’ 

Net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and leaving Britain – was below 100,000 during much of the 1990s before increasing sharply in 1998 under Labour.

From 2004 it was consistently above 200,000 and reached a peak of more than 250,000 in 2010.

After Theresa May entered the Home 
Office it fell to 153,000 by 2012 but rose to 182,000 in the 12 months 
to June last year, driven by arrivals from southern Europe.

The
 Tories pledged to reduce the total to under 100,000 by the time of the 
next election, but the Liberal Democrats never signed up to the policy.

Mr Cable recently claimed the Tories were spreading ‘panic’ about immigration.

Last
 night a Tory source said: ‘The public want the Government to control 
immigration. If the Liberal Democrats don’t want to listen to the 
public, then they ought to drop the democrats part of their name.’

The NatCen Social Research British 
Social Attitudes survey found 56 per cent believe immigration should be 
reduced ‘a lot’, and 21 per cent ‘a little’.

Just 17 per cent want migrant numbers to stay the same, and 4 cent want them increased.

In the programme, former home and 
foreign Secretary Jack Straw admits predictions of how many would come 
after 2004, when restrictions were dropped for certain EU countries, 
were ‘completely catastrophic. They were wrong by a factor of ten’

After controls were dropped, he said, immigration became ‘bluntly a nightmare’. 

But
 David Blunkett, Labour home secretary between 2001 to 2004, said: ‘I’m 
unapologetic because if you don’t have legal managed migration and 
people don’t sign up so they pay national insurance and tax, they’ll 
work illegally.’

Opposing: In the programme, Jack Straw (left) admits predictions of how many people would come after 2004 were 'catastrophic', but David Blunkett, home secretary between 2001 and 2004, said he was 'unapologetic'

Mrs May told the programme: ‘I don’t think people have looked at [immigration] sufficiently closely to be able to recognise the impact it has on members of the public.’

David Hanson, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: 'Vince Cable is right to say that the Prime Minister's net migration measure is actually rising and not falling to the tens of thousands as he promised.

'He could also point out that the Home Office's obsession with the net migration target ignores illegal immigration and is actually pushing migration into less controlled routes. This gap between the Government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence.'
