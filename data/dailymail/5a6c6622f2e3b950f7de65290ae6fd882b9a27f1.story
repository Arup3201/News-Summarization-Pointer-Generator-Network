Tragedy: George Verrier died after refusing treatment for his injuries

Police told a fatally wounded  
teenager to ‘get a bus’ to hospital after a 16th birthday party 
descended into violence, friends said last night.

George
Verrier, 17, died after being hit in the head during a mass brawl as 
revellers left the celebration at the £500,000 home of a pupil at the 
renowned Brit School.

Officers gave first aid to the teenager, described by witnesses as dazed and bleeding.

But
he did not seek further medical help and instead staggered half a mile 
to a friend’s house, where he was discovered unconscious the next 
morning.

Paramedics were called and George was airlifted to hospital where he was declared dead nine hours later.

Last night Scotland Yard said the teenager had ‘declined’ to be taken to hospital when officers spoke to him.

But
friends claimed police simply told him to ‘get a bus’.

The case has now
been referred to the independent police watchdog.

The mother of his 
best friend, Heather Baber, said George, who was also known by the 
surname Verrico, was effectively abandoned by police.

Dawn Baber, 50, said: ‘Heather was told that the police said to George that he had to go to the hospital.

‘He said, “Can you take me?”, but they said he had to get there himself and take the bus. They refused to take him.

‘But
being at that age, if you’re shaken up, the first thing you want to do 
is go home or to your friend’s. You don’t want to travel on your own to 
hospital, you just want to sleep it off.’

The
brawl happened as partygoers left the 16th birthday party of Madison 
Moran, a dance student at the Brit School, shortly after 12.30am on 
Sunday.

Former pupils of the performing arts school in Croydon include 
singers Adele, Jessie J and Amy Winehouse.

Incident: The 20-strong fight happened after the party of Brit School student Madison Moran (pictured)

Event: This is the house in Bromley where the 16th birthday party was held on Saturday night before a fight spilled into the street

Scene: A police car outside the house today, where more than 20 people fought, which led to the death of 17-year-old George Verrier

Neighbours said dozens of young people were involved in fighting outside Madison’s home in Bromley, south east London.

They
said the party appeared ‘well organised’, with bouncers employed to 
stop gate-crashers and letters sent out to warn of the noise.

Angela
Beatty, 58, who lives opposite, said: ‘It was just a melee.

'There were 
about 150 kids in the street. It was like a pack mentality. I’m sure 
they’re all nice individually, but together it was just horrible. They 
can’t all have come from the party because there were too many of them.

'But these days, with Facebook, it’s so easy to find out that something 
like this is happening.

Madison’s father Connie, 47, said: ‘He was a good friend of hers and she’s really distraught by it all.

‘He was one of the best boys … He was one of the quietest and most well-liked boys.’

Friends said George, who had two sisters, attended Sir Roger Manwood’s School in Sandwich, Kent.

When
asked whether officers offered to help George get to hospital or call 
him an ambulance, a Met spokesman said he could not comment.

But in an 
earlier statement, the force said: ‘The victim, who was on his way home 
from a party …  declined to be taken to hospital.’

The
case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Last night a 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder remained in 
custody.
