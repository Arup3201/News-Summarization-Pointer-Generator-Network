Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen has urged Harry Kane NOT to play for England Under 21s this summer.

Kane is set for his first senior call-up later this month for the games against Lithuania and Italy.

But the plan then is for Kane to drop down back into the Under 21s for this summer’s European Championships in the Czech Republic.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has already warned the FA he wants talks with the FA before giving them his blessing to call-up Kane this summer.

And Vertonghen, who played in the tournament in 2007, says the 21-year-old, who has played 41 games already this season, should skip the tournament in preparation for next season.

The Belgian said: ‘It’s difficult for me to judge. Of course England want him. He is a brilliant striker and he can be the main man, but I think he needs his rest for next season.

‘It’s his call and I know a player always wants to play but sometimes you have to be careful. It’s a difficult one because last season I played with injuries, but sometimes you just can’t. You have to think about what’s going to come.

'It’s his decision and it’s a totally different situation from when I played in 2007. Did that benefit my development as a player? It’s hard to tell.

‘I enjoyed playing for my country because I never played international football at youth level.

‘So that was my first tournament as a Belgium player and I enjoyed it. It was in Holland and I played in Holland for Ajax at the time, so for me it was brilliant.’

Ross Barkley is another player whose club are considering asking if the young player can be left out

Barkley has not played for the Under-21s since winning his solitary cap in a 6-0 win against Scotland in 2013

In another blow for Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate, Everton want Ross Barkley to be given a summer of rest and hope he will not be included in the squad.

Barkley has not played for the Under 21s since winning his solitary cap in a 6-0 win against Scotland in August 2013, as he has been a regular in Roy Hodgson’s senior squads since then.

However, Barkley is a player Southgate would want to consider.

Everton, however, are anxious about how Barkley’s form has fluctuated this season and would prefer the 21-year-old to spend the close season recharging.

Everton are anxious about how Barkley’s form has fluctuated this season and his injury record

Barkley suffered a significant setback at the start of this campaign by damaging his knee ligaments

Barkley went to the World Cup last year and suffered a significant setback at the start of this campaign, when damaging his knee ligaments that led to him spending eight weeks on the sidelines.

The explosive nature of Barkley’s game has been missing in recent months and the statistics he has been producing in games have not matched the levels of 12 months ago.

That is why Everton believe Barkley’s development would be best served by him being given the opportunity to completely rest in June and July before returning refreshed for pre-season.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez and Southgate have an excellent work relationship and it is expected they will speak in the coming weeks.
