New Zealand won the third Test against Pakistan by an innings and 80 runs at Sharjah to draw the three-match series 1-1.

The Black Caps posted a record 690 to take a first-innings lead of 339, steered to that commanding position by Brendon McCullum's double century and 192 from Kane Williamson.

Trent Boult then ripped through Pakistan's top order and Asad Shafiq's 137 proved nothing more than an entertaining delay as New Zealand eased to victory.

The players emerged to start the day's play wearing black armbands on what would have been Phillip Hughes' 26th birthday following his tragic death this week.

With Tim Southee having departed to the final ball on day three, Ish Sodhi joined Mark Craig at the crease for New Zealand and the latter soon brought up his half-century with a six off Yasir Shah.

Another six from Craig moved the Black Caps to 680 and with a single off the next ball they brought up their highest ever innings total, surpassing the 680 for eight declared against India earlier this year.

Craig then fell to the final ball of the over as he presented Mohammad Hafeez with a simple caught and bowled to fall for 65 off 85 balls.

A six from Sodhi produced a record 88th boundary of the innings from New Zealand and when he fell caught at slip off Shah for 22, the innings was over.

Pakistan's response began badly with Shan Masood falling for just four, edging Boult to Southee at third slip.

Boult had a second victim soon after as he bowled Azhar Ali for six, and when Younis Khan was lbw for a duck off the first ball of the paceman's next over, he was on a hat-trick.

Misbah-ul-Haq left the next delivery alone outside off and he and Hafeez guided the home side through to 30 for three at lunch.

The experienced pair were likely to be Pakistan's only hope of saving the match but when Hafeez was caught and bowled by Craig for 24 in just the second over after the break, their prospects were looking dire.

Misbah and Shafiq steadied the innings to an extent but the captain was gone for 12 when he got the thinnest of gloves to a Craig delivery and BJ Watling took the catch behind the stumps.

Shafiq and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 73 for the sixth wicket with Shafiq bringing up his fifty from 78 balls but the partnership was ended when Ross Taylor took a smart catch off Sodhi at first slip to remove Sarfraz for 37.

Yasir strode out and hit his first two balls for a four and a six but was gone to the fourth he faced, trapped in front by Sodhi.

Daniel Vettori had been recalled to the New Zealand Test team for the first time since July 2012 and he got among the wickets by removing Mohammad Talha lbw for 19 to leave Pakistan 180 for eight.

Shafiq clearly saw that as an invitation to open up his shoulders as he began to find the boundary at will and brought up his century off 123 balls.

He and Rahat Ali put on 78, with Shafiq supplying 72 of them, before the latter fell for a 148-ball 137 which included 18 fours and six sixes, Boult claiming his fourth wicket.

Rahat was the last man to go for six when he holed out to McCullum off Craig.
