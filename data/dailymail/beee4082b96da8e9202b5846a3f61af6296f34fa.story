The Liberal Democrats’ share of the Rochester vote was the lowest ever achieved by any major party in a by-election.

Nick Clegg was humiliated as his party came in fifth place – only 300 votes ahead of Charlotte Rose, a former ‘sex worker of the year’ who stood as an independent.

The Lib Dem candidate Geoff Juby received just 349 votes, with the party losing its deposit for the eighth time since 2010.

Lib Dem candidate Geoff Juby managed to narrowly defeated former 'sex worker of the year' Charlotte Rose

With only 0.9 per cent of the ballots cast in Rochester and Strood, the result raises fears of a Lib Dem meltdown in next year’s election.

In 2010, the Liberal Democrats won 7,800 votes in the constituency – 16.3 per cent of the total – to come third after the Conservatives and Labour.

On Thursday, the party came behind Ukip, the Tories, Labour and the Greens – although it did manage to beat Hairy Knorm Davidson, of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, and Miss Rose.

Dominatrix Miss Rose, a friend of former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men.

Miss Rose called for more sex education in schools, ‘sexual equality’ for the elderly and disabled, and the legalisation of the sex industry and also defeated the Liberal Democrat candidate Geoff Juby

She received 43 votes for policies including more sex education in schools, ‘sexual equality’ for the elderly and disabled, and the legalisation of the sex industry. 

Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron yesterday said the party had found itself in ‘a really funny electoral situation’. He added: ‘When I went knocking on doors in Rochester I found amongst the people I spoke to plenty of Lib Dems who took the interesting view to tactically vote Conservative to try and beat Ukip.

‘My assumption is more Lib Dem and Labour voters voted Tory than there were Tories voting Tory, as they all seemed to vote Ukip. It’s a peculiar situation that all of us will take some time to take stock of.

‘Next May we won’t see a majority government from any party, in which case we need to think about what kind of government we want – one in hock to extremist nationalists, or including Lib Dems who are moderate, sensible and helped to get the economy back on track.’

Candidates lose their deposit if they score less than 5 per cent of the vote – a major humiliation for a party of government.

The previous record for the lowest share for a major party in a by-election was set by the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie vote of 1948, who received 1.2 per cent of the vote.

The Lib Dems had traditionally done well in by-elections, but it has a dismal record since going into Coalition – with the exception of the poll in Eastleigh, which they held.
