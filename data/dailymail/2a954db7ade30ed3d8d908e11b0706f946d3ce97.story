The BBC is set to launch five new HD channels to accompany its digital stations next year.

The services will bring higher quality pictures for BBC News, BBC3, BBC4, Cbeebies and CBBC, adding around 250 hours of HD shows each week.

The announcement comes as Ofcom said it would use spare capacity to create 10 HD channels for digital terrestrial viewers who use Freeview.

The BBC has announced it is launching five new HD channels to its digital services over the next year. The services will bring higher quality pictures to BBC News, pictured receiving a visit from the Queen last month, BBC3, BBC4, Cbeebies and CBBC, adding 250 hours of shows a week

The BBC recently announced it is ditching is its 3D channels. 

The upcoming Dr Who anniversary special in November will be the last BBC show to be broadcast in 3D.

The
BBC has been trialling 3D shows since 2011, including the Olympics, 
Wimbledon, Strictly Come Dancing and others, all broadcast free-to-air 
in 3D.

However, 
apparently only half of those actually capable of watching stuff in 3D 
actually do, so the BBC has decide to end the trial.

According to the BBC, two of the new channels - BBC Three HD and CBBC HD - will use existing unused capacity.

CBeebies HD and BBC Four HD will share a channel since they will not be broadcast at the same time.

The BBC announced that transmission company Arqiva will provide the infrastructure behind the new Freeview services after being awarded the licence to do so by Ofcom recently.

Arqiva said that that up to 70 per cent of the UK population should be able to receive the new channels over their aerials.

The 550-606MHz spectrum band being used for the new channels was freed up as a result of the UK's digital TV switchover last year.

This means there is still the potential for up to a further eight new HD channels to be added to Freeview as a result of Ofcom's move.

Most of the HD programmes from the new BBC channels will also be available on the BBC's on-demand iPlayer service.

The BBC said more than half of UK homes are able to receive HD pictures, and this is expected to rise to 80 per cent by 2016.

Director-general
Tony Hall said: 'BBC1 HD and BBC2 HD have already proved to be highly 
valued by our audiences and I'm delighted that we're able to follow this
with the launch of five new subscription-free BBC HD channels by early 
2014.

According to the BBC, two of the new channels - BBC Three HD and CBBC HD - will use existing unused capacity. CBeebies HD, which features shows such as Rastamouse, pictured, and BBC Four HD will share a channel since they will not be broadcast at the same time

'These new channels will allow us to showcase more of our programming at its very best.'

In addition to the five new services, the corporation hopes to launch regional variations of BBC1 in HD for England and BBC2 versions for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Kim Shillinglaw, the BBC’s head of 3D, told Radio Times: 'we will see what happens when the recession ends and there may be more take up of sets, but I think the BBC will be having a wait-and-see. It’s the right time for a good old pause.'
