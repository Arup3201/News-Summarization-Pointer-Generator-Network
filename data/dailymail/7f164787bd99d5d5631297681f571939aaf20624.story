Scientists have discovered how the atmosphere of Mars turned to stone.

British researchers believe they have worked out how Mars lost its early carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere to become the cold and arid planet it is today.

The research provides the first direct evidence on Mars of a process called 'carbonation', whereby a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide, water and chemicals within solid rock react to 'suck in' the carbon and trap it within the rock.

The process exists here as well, and scientists believe understanding and harnessing carbonation could make it an ally in controlling climate and CO2 emissions on Earth.

It is widely recognised that accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is contributing to global warming.

However, the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars around 4,000 million years ago is likely to have caused the planet to cool.

The research was carried out at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, the University of Glasgow, and the Natural History Museum in London

In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, the research team describes analyses of a Martian meteorite known as Lafayette, sourced from the research collections of the Natural History Museum and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

The latest theory is the CO2 in Mars' atmosphere was sucked into rocks, in
a process called carbonation.

The process occurs naturally on Earth, and if harnessed, could be used to combat climate change.

Researchers at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, the University of Glasgow and the Natural History Museum in London found evidence of this by studying a meteorite known as Lafayette.

The meteorite is thought
to have landed on Earth roughly 3,000 years ago.

They found patterns of carbonate minerals in the meteorite by using an electron scanning microscope.

These patterns form 
when carbon dissolved in liquid water seeps into rocks containing the 
mineral olivine.

The carbon replaces the olivine, locking it away in the rock.

It formed from molten rock around 1,300 million years ago, and was blasted from the surface of Mars by a massive impact 11 million years ago. Since its discovery in Indiana, US, in 1931, Lafayette has been studied by scientists around the world.

The new research focused on a carbon-rich mineral called siderite. Although found in Lafayette previously, the team discovered that the siderite had formed by the process of 'carbonation', whereby water and carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere reacted with rocks containing the mineral olivine. 

These reactions then formed siderite crystals, replacing the olivine, and in so doing captured the atmospheric carbon dioxide and permanently stored it within the rock.

Lafayette provides direct evidence for storage of carbon dioxide in the fairly recent history of Mars, some time after 1,300 million years. 

However, as all of the ingredients for 
carbonation were present on early Mars - in the form of olivine, water 
and carbon dioxide - this reaction may explain how carbon dioxide was 
removed from the planet's atmosphere, changing its climate from warm, wet
and hospitable to life, to cold, dry and hostile.

The research may explain how carbon dioxide was removed from Mars' atmosphere changing its climate from warm, wet and hospitable to life, the hostile one that Nasa's Curiosity rover (pictured) is exploring today

While this process also occurs naturally on Earth, and is the focus of research examining methods of permanently locking up carbon dioxide from power stations, the magnitude of the effect on early Mars indicates that it has the potential to be effective on a planetary scale.

Lead author Doctor Tim Tomkinson, of the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, said: 'Mars once had a thick atmosphere that was rich in water and carbon dioxide, and so this process of carbonation may help answer the mystery of why the Martian climate deteriorated around 4,000 million years ago.

'This discovery is both significant in terms of the way in which scientists will study Mars in the future but also to providing us with vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change.'
