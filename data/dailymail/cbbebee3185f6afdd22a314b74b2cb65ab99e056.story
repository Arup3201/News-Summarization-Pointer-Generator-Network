Energy companies have admitted giving dire service and baffling customers with confusing bills designed to hide the true cost of heating and lighting out homes.

Energy bosses say customers have been ‘taken for granted’ and treated badly, with charges that were ‘never transparent’.

The astonishing admissions, delivered anonymously to pollsters for a new report this week, sparked warnings from Downing Street that increased competition to take on the Big Six energy firms was needed to improve customer service.

Energy bosses say customers have been 'taken for granted' and treated badly, with charges that were 'never transparent'

Industry watchdog Ofgem last week announced it was referring the entire energy market to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for investigation.

It found ‘possible tacit co-ordination’ on prices, with the Big Six firms - British Gas, SSE, Eon, Npower, Scottish Power and EDF - apparently moving tariffs up and down at the same time.

Specifically, there is new evidence that they are quick to raise prices when costs rise but slow to reduce them.

Now it has emerged that behind closed doors the bosses of some of the country’s biggest energy suppliers acknowledge they have been treating their customers badly.

They spoke to pollster YouGov for a report to be published at a conference this week entitled Energy, Politics and the Consumer.

According to The Times, the remarks reveal a disregard for the customer and admit public anger at their treatment has fuelled Ed Miliband’s radical plan to impose a two-year freeze if Labour wins the 2015 election.

The combined annual profits from the Big Six companies

Bosses from firms including SSE, E.ON UK and RWE npower took part in the survey, along with senior figures from smaller companies.

Leading energy figures told YouGov interviewers: ‘Customers were taken for granted, service was poor, and no one bothered to explain the situation to them’

The report adds: ‘The industry broadly accepts it helped to create the political opportunity that Miliband seized. ‘As one would expect, there is moaning at politicians: practitioners believe that behind closed doors the politicians understand and even admit that a price freeze would be disruptive and unrealistic, and it’s been mere opportunism to invent an ogre that they can then pretend to slay.’

But it adds: ‘The industry also accepts that it has itself “prepared the ground” for what happened: billing was often confusing, never transparent, and complaints were handled badly.’

Downing Street said the problems could only be tackled if the power of the Big Six was broken up through more competition in the market.

David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'There is not enough competition in this area. Competition is at the heart of the way we improve service across the board be it in terms of cost pressures, in the wider customer service, we want more competition.'

The Prime Minister 'wants cost pressures coming down for all families,' the spokesman added.

Richard Lloyd, the executive director 
of Which?, said: ‘It would be deeply worrying if energy industry leaders
 didn’t recognise the dire state of distrust they face.

‘Our
 latest consumer survey shows satisfaction in this market has plummeted 
to a new low and only one in five consumers trusts suppliers to act in 
their best interest. That is why it is right to refer the energy market 
to a full-scale competition investigation — but suppliers should not 
wait to be forced into action and should start now to put customers 
first, keep costs as low as possible and trade transparently.’

Labour’s shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex said: ‘These comments vindicate everything Labour has been saying for the last two years on the dysfunctional nature of the energy market.

‘It is unsurprising that people don't trust the industry and won't until the market is clear fair and transparent.’

‘The only way to restore trust is to reset the energy market by freezing prices until 2017 and reforming the market to make it more transparent and competitive, as Labour has proposed.’

According to YouGov opinion polls, energy firms are less trusted than bankers.

More than two-thirds of people – 67 per cent – say the energy industry operates as a cartel while 51 per cent say rising bills has forced them to turn their heating down or off in the last year.

The Department for Energy and Climate Change said: 'The findings released last week by Ofgem and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) demonstrate the need to rebuild trust and confidence in the energy market.

'Ofgem announced last week tough action based on a detailed, independent expert assessment of the state of competition in Britain’s energy markets - leading to the first ever market reference for the energy markets.

'This is just too important for people to rely on guesses about how to fix the energy markets. If we get it wrong, consumers will pay the price.

'We will give Ofgem and the CMA whatever support they need to get this done as quickly as possible.

'In the meantime, we’ll keep working to help people pay less for the energy they use - continuing to drive the competition that has seen people switching supplier in record numbers, simpler tariffs and bills, getting energy companies to give back direct debit balances, taking £50 off the average bill and making switching faster and easier than it's ever been.'
