You may have thought all superyachts were created equal. But according to one designer, there is a gap in the market for vessels targeted at the fairer sex.

In case the world's most powerful women don't want to splash out on the regular millionaires' toys on the market, luxury designer Lidia Bersani has created the first luxury mega yacht with a female in mind.

The sleek white and gold yacht, measuring an impressive 262ft, is targeted at female buyers and is designed using crystal, gold, fur and flowers. It is even named La Belle, which translates as 'the beauty'.

The master cabin is unsurprisingly lavish with a round king size double bed and baldachin and its own terrace with panoramic views

The 80-metre superyacht is not for the faint hearted, or Laura Ashley lovers. It's  a riot of opulent gold mosaics, mother of pearl, Swarovski crystal chandeliers, gemstones, onyx and bespoke wooden furniture. 

The boat's design revolves around  soft edges, smooth lines, floral patterns and a large amount of glass, crystal and bright white.

Lidia Bersani's website says of La Belle: '[The] Yacht is in distinctive Bersani Style, romantic and warm. The colors in white, ivory and gold are predominant. Interior is full of opulent and comfortable elements.'

The vessel could comfortably sleep 12 guests in six deluxe cabins.

If you get bored of sunning yourself on deck there are a few lounges, dining places and facilities for live music on board

The master cabin on the second deck is unsurprisingly decadent; with a round king size double bed and baldachin (a  canopy that traditionally sits over a throne or tomb of someone important), private terrace, thick curtains, gold touches and floral carpeting.

There are five other guest suites spread around the boat. If you get bored of sunning yourself on deck the yacht has lounges, dining places and facilities for live music.

In place of darts boards and computer games, you'll find a spa area with hyrdromassage pool, sauna, hamman, infrared sauna, snow room and ice fountains; small fitness club with outdoor Jacuzzi; library with fireplace; beauty centre, disco club, cinema – theatre, as well as a few bars. 

'The idea is to equip this Super Yacht with ultra-modern stabilizing system and state of the art machinery and equipment,' says Lidia Bersani Luxury Design.

There are five decks and a lift to get you from one to another, as well as a helicopter landing pad on the roof... although a gold helicopter is not included

Each of the five decks has an outside area for relaxing, sun bathing and looking our to sea. There's a lift as well as staircase to take you in between them. 

A helicopter landing pad sits on top of the vessel, naturally. And in the designs mocked up by Ms Bersani, a gold helicopter sits in board.

Of the price, Ms Bersani told MailOnline, 'Unfortunately we do not have yet the final price. The idea is to build the most luxurious yacht on the world, and the golden decorations, Swarovski crystals, and some precious stones which we would like to use, it will be not cheap, I am sure.'

Although Ms Bersani told MailOnline she had not yet decided on the final price for the yacht, she said, 'it will not be cheap, I am sure.'
