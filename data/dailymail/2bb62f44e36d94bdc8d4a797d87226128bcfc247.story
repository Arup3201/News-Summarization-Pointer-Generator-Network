Gale force winds and driving rain might not sound like fun to most of us but for surfer Andrew Cotton, 34, stormy weather means the chance to pit his skills against towering 80ft waves.

But the incredible photographs of Cotton tackling the surf created by the St. Jude's storm in Portugal yesterday didn't impress everyone. Critics condemned his feat as 'stupid' and 'idiotic' and called on him to show a more responsible attitude towards his family.

Now his wife Katie, 37, has hit back at the critics, arguing that surfing is what her husband was born to do and revealing her pride in his achievement.

Happy family: Surfer Andrew Cotton and his wife Katie with their two children, Honey, six, and Ace, one

Adorable: Katie says she hopes her one-year-old son Ace won't become a surfer like his father

'I feel a mixture of things when I watch him doing something like that,' she said in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'I'm really pleased for him because he's doing what he loves, what he's been trained to do. At the same time, I'm terrified because to do that [surfing] would be my worst nightmare so I'm relieved he came through it OK.'

Cotton, a professional surfer and part time lifeguard from Croyde in North Devon, successfully completed his attempt on the 80ft behemoth.

But his colleague, fellow surfer, Maya Gabeira wasn't so lucky.

The Brazilian was knocked unconscious by a wave and had to be pulled from the surf and given CPR.

After being rushed to hospital, it was later revealed that she had suffered a broken leg in the incident.

Katie, who knows the risks her husband takes when he goes into the water, says that she's always relieved when she hears the phone ring and his voice on the other end after one of his surfing exploits.

'As soon 
as the phone rings and I know he's on dry land, I'm OK,' she explains. 'That's all I care about - for me, all 
about getting the phone call.'

Despite being left on the edge of her seat by his exploits, Katie says she can't imagine him doing anything else and is completely supportive of his choices.

Proud: Katie says she is thrilled about her husband's incredible achievement and cannot wait to see him again

'He's been surfing since before I met him,' she explains. 'I'm completely supportive because it's who he is - he's totally driven and he's following his heart.

'When not doing it, he's a little bit of a lost soul even if it does mean pushing boundaries, so as far as I'm concerned, good on him.

'It's terrifying for me but he's doing the right thing by himself.'

Katie, who was at home bracing herself against St Jude's storm while her husband made his attempt, might be supportive of Andrew's efforts but admits she might not feel the same if one of her children, Honey, six, or Ace, one, decided to follow in their father's footsteps.

'I'd
 just have to laugh,' she chuckles. 'Doing it myself is actually, literally my worst nightmare! Being a wife and having a husband doing it is tough but having child do it 
would be even harder.

'[Andrew's] mum is incredible.'

In the meantime, music teacher Katie is looking forward to welcoming her adventurous husband home to Devon in a few days time.

'I really am looking forward to it,' she says. 'I want to say well done and give him a huge hug. He's done absolutely brilliantly and after working so hard and doing so much training.

'He's following 
his dreams and I'm just so proud. We all are here.'

Death-defying: Andrew tackles one of the 80ft waves blown up by the St Jude's storm on Monday

Incredible: Andrew was supported by two jetskis during his feat and trained for months before attempting it

'Sometimes I think these daredevil people should die. There was warning about the weather. Obviously they didn't care. Just to rescue them, at least few emergency people were engaged. When they could have saved older or genuine emergency cases.' - Hasan, London

'Speechless! THAT IS EPIC, and Andrew Cotton looks like such a normal good lad... Keep the photos coming!! - Magnus Norton, London

'"TOTALY [sic] IRRESPONSIBLE" especialy [sic] putting the lives of would be rescuers at RISK.' - Anthony Payne, Gloucestershire

'Amazing photos! As for people criticising, yes, it may have been "irresponsible", but I'm pretty sure most people who take part in water sports/extreme sports are aware of the risks... It's their choice if they choose to take them doing something that they enjoy.' Anon_Girl, Southampton

'A man with two young children risking his life for an adrenaline rush ... time to grow up you selfish idiot.' - Budgie, Norwich

'Crazy people, but the thrill of riding those huge waves in stormy weather must be amazing. They know the risks. Trouble is, other people could end up drowning trying to rescue them.' TWINKLE, Kent

'What an unbelievably selfish & irresponsible so-called father!' - LJ, South East

'Wow! great to have an English bloke out there amongst of all the usual Hawaiian and Aussie surfers.' - Ipf22, London
