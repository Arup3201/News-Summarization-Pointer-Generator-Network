Chief executive of Comic Relief, Kevin Cahill, (pictured receiving his CBE) pledged to 'do the right thing' after the public backlash

The beleaguered boss of Comic Relief yesterday promised to carry out a full review of its investments following revelations that it had pumped millions of pounds into tobacco, arms and alcohol companies.

The charity is facing a huge public backlash and scathing criticisms from some of its own stars for putting money in controversial ‘booze, bombs and fags’ funds.

Critics say the investments undermine its work to help the victims of smoking-related diseases, alcohol abuse and war.

Hours after the revelations, thousands
 of Comic Relief viewers expressed their fury on Twitter, with many 
saying they wished they had never donated.

Despite
 initially defending the policy on the grounds that ethical investments 
would generate a smaller return, chief executive Kevin Cahill appeared 
to backtrack yesterday, pledging to ‘do the right thing’.

Speaking
 ahead of the BBC Panorama expose last night that broke the story, he 
said: ‘We will do a full review of our policy after this particular 
programme and these discussions.

‘It’s
 really important that the public stick with us, that they trust us to 
do the right thing and they understand that we are listening to the 
messages that are out there on the social networks.

‘It’s showing us on the social networks this morning that the public do have some concern about these things.’

This year’s Red Nose Day raised more than £100million after an eight-hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, fronted by presenters including Lenny Henry, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.

But some of the charity’s own stars, including comedians Frankie Boyle and Al Murray, have since distanced themselves from its activities, trading jokes about its connection to companies such as weapons manufacturer BAE Systems and cigarette firm British American Tobacco.

Frankie Boyle tweeted: ‘Will happily perform at this year’s Comic Relief if paid in guns.’

According to Comic Relief’s accounts from 2007 to 2009, it placed millions in City funds that invested in the companies, including £2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009.

It is sitting on a £100million pot of money donated by the public, despite promising to hand ‘every pound’ straight to good causes in its annual broadcasts.

Mr Cahill – whose pay has increased from £111,000 to £131,000 since 2011 – told the BBC’s World At One programme yesterday that the investments were ‘a small percentage, no more than 5 per cent of our funds in any of those particular areas’.

Stars including Ronni Ancona, Craig David, Lorraine Kelly, Scott Mills, Olly Murs and Dermot O'Leary, took part in the BT Red Nose Desert Trek in aid of Comic Relief

But he conceded: ‘The most important 
thing for us is to keep the trust and faith of the public. We would 
clearly be keen to be in ethical funds if they match other funds.

‘We should never forget that we are nothing without the public. They have given us over £800million to date.

‘All of that money, every single penny, partly because of our investment policy, has gone to people living in extreme poverty and to vulnerable communities domestically and overseas. We are listening to the public and we will do the right thing.’

But former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth gave Comic Relief a back-handed compliment for its investment policy last night.

He said it should be ‘proud’ to invest in BAE Systems, saying the firm ‘contributes substantially to the defence of the United Kingdom and our way of life so that sanctimonious charity leaders may freely exercise their stupid prejudices’.
