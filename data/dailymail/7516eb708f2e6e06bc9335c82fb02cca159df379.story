Arthritis-sufferer Alice Swallow cannot wait to hold her fiance's hand for the very first time after having two life-changing elbow replacement operations.

Brave Alice, 24, is now recovering at home with her boyfriend after a second op to fix her fused joints after years of agony as a result of the crippling condition.

She's also buzzing at the prospect of going out and buying a wedding dress as she prepares to tie the knot with sweetheart Ryan Harrison, 24, next year.

Excited: Alice Swallow, 24, cannot wait to hold her fiance Ryan Harrison's hand for the first time after she had two major elbow replacement operations

Operation: Alice is thought to be one of the youngest people in Britain to undergo the life-changing elbow surgery

Alice, of Ipswich, Suffolk, said: 'I am looking forward to the little things.

'Pouring myself a drink, being able to go swimming, even just going into town and trying on clothes on my own.

'For so long I have relied on Ryan to help me with day-to-day tasks.

'But I am most looking forward to holding his hand properly for the first time since I met him.'

Life-changing: Alice was unable to hold hands with Ryan before the surgery after her elbows fused at a 90 degree angle

Miss Swallow was just 10 when she was diagnosed 14 years ago with rheumatoid arthritis - a devastating condition which left her unable to bend her arms.

Since meeting Ryan three years ago, the customer services adviser at Haven Power has never held his hand after both her elbows fused at a 90 degree angle.

Following her first operation at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London last month, Alice had her second operation on her left arm a week last Tuesday.

'I am sore,' she said.

'A lot of people, including my surgeon wanted me to wait longer between operations.

'But I had got it in my head that I would have them both done quickly.

Happy Alice said she can now bend her right arm properly for the first time.

'It feels brilliant,' she said, 'it's overwhelming.

'I will never ever take for granted the use of my arms.'

While it will be a couple of months before she's fully recovered, Alice is desperate to go shopping for her wedding dress - something she has put off until after the operation.

Elbow replacement is a relatively rare operation which is only carried out between 500 and 1,000 times a year in the UK.

Medics believe Alice is one of the youngest people in Britain to have undergone the tough procedure.
