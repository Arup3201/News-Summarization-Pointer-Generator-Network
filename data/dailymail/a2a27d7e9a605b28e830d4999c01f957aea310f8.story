Read Pietersen's forthright views on Andy Flower and his team of 'Boy Scouts' 

And his opinion of 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior 

I did not text South Africans ways to dismiss Strauss, says Pietersen 

Kevin Pietersen has detailed how the England dressing room quickly deteriorated into a clique-ridden unit in which the mild-mannered Jonathan Trott told team-mate Matt Prior to 'f*** off'.

The atmosphere soured when Andy Flower took over as coach and divisions developed between batsmen and bowlers, says Pietersen.

In his book, KP: The Autobiography, he tells of how the situation got so bad in Bangladesh in 2010 that it led to Trott losing his temper and shouting abuse at Prior and Graeme Swann on the pitch before a bemused opposition.

He describes how the introverted James Anderson liked to attach himself to extroverts, and fell upon Swann, a ‘loudmouth’, who was ‘the one who picked on players’. 

Pietersen says that the batsmen such as Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Alastair Cook, Eoin Morgan and a young Joe Root were men who would not say ‘boo to a goose’, who took stick from their team-mates on a daily basis.

The continual ridicule and rollockings from the bowlers and wicketkeeper finally made Trott snap when he was fielding at deep square leg during the Test match against Bangladesh. 

According to Pietersen he ‘cracked’ and started shouting 'Will you f*** off? Who the f*** do you think you are?'

Pietersen sympathised with the Warwickshire player and accuses the dressing room of ‘quietly isolating’ him (Pietersen), blaming Flower for not creating a more inclusive atmosphere.

Prior, whom Pietersen dubs 'the Big Cheese', is highly criticised in the book.

The nickname was given, according to the author, because Prior was 'a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie'.
