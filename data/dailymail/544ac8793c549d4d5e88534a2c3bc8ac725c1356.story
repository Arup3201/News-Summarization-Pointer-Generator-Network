It might be almost 200 years since the first wagons rolled their way towards the Pacific coast along the Oregon Trail, but it seems it still has as much of a draw with Americans looking for a better life.

The state has topped a list for the most popular place to move to for the second year in a row.

More than 66 per cent of the Oregon moves carried out by United Van Lines were people relocating to the state, rather than moving out.

In comparison, 65 per cent of the people it served in New Jersey moved away, according to the company.

Oregon's outdoor space is one of the reasons more people move to the state than leave it, it is believed (Pictured is the Three Sisters Wilderness Area, Willamette National Forest)

Portland also has a lot to recommend it - including being one of the most innovative cities for urban planning

Economist Michael Stoll,  chairman of the Department of Public Policy at the University of California, said the figures reflected the overall trend in migration towards southern and western states.

However, it is Oregon's 'unique amenities' which he believes push it to the top of the pile. 

These include outdoor recreation, arts and entertainment activities, and green space - which the mountainous state has plenty of. 

Travel Oregon, the state's tourist board, lists its own 'seven wonders' - including the Columbia River Gorge, to Crater Lake and the Wallowa Mountains.

The cost of living is also 1.2 per cent lower than the American average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Oregon was also named one of the top three states for job growth during 2013, while Portland was named one of the most innovative cities for urban planning, according to CNN Money.  

However, its education system was ranked 41 in the country by Education Week - with residents pointing to the state's lower-than-average spend on each student as a possible cause.

But 64 per cent of people moved in New Jersey were moving out of the state, rather than into it - making it the least popular in this year's list

However, while Oregon had the best moving in-out ratio, far fewer people decided to make their home in the state than elsewhere in America.

United Van Lines moved 28,036 homes in California last year, with just over half moving into the state.

This is in spite of the fact that those living in California need to earn, on average, $6,000 more than those living in Oregon - where the company had just 4,121 shipments in total.

But Oregon was in no way the state with the lowest number of shipments  in the country: United Van Lines conducted only 325 shipments in Vermont, the fourth most popular destination for people to make their home.
