Amazon is under fire yet again for its UK tax arrangements after ‘galling’ figures showed how little it paid last year.

In fact, the internet retailer received more in government grants than it paid into the Treasury coffers.

MPs and booksellers joined in the criticism after Amazon’s accounts, filed yesterday, showed it raked in more than £4billion in UK sales – but paid just £2.4million in corporation tax.

In the same year, it received 
£2.5million in government and EU grants for operating warehouses in less
prosperous parts of the country.

Amazon’s paltry corporation tax figure
– it has now paid a mere £6million over the past decade – is so small 
because the group channels revenues to its subsidiary in Luxembourg, 
where it enjoys huge tax breaks.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs 
the influential Public Accounts Committee, called the figures a ‘joke’. She said: ‘Companies like Amazon should pay their fair share of tax 
based on their economic activity in this country and the profits they 
make here.

‘Its behaviour is not only unfair, it 
is anti-competitive, putting British businesses that do pay their proper
tax at a disadvantage.’

Tax avoidance campaign group UK Uncut said: 'It's an absolute disgrace that Amazon is paying such tiny amounts in tax.

'The Government should be clamping down on tax avoidance rather than slashing the welfare state, privatising the NHS and cutting legal aid for ordinary people.

'This shows us yet again that the Government is making a political choice rather than an economic necessity.'

Amazon, which sells one in every four 
books bought in Britain as well as a huge range of other goods, has 
previously been accused of ‘laying waste to the high street’.

Last year, Amazon sparked outrage when
it emerged that it, and other multinational corporations such as Google
and Starbucks, avoided millions in UK taxes.

In 2011 Amazon paid just £1.8million 
despite raking in sales of £3.4billion in the UK – a figure it tried to 
keep secret until MPs demanded it reveal the information.

The Public 
Accounts Committee called all three firms ‘immoral’ for leaving 
taxpayers to pick up the bill while they made vast profits.

Amazon’s UK sales in 2012 rose by 
almost 30 per cent to £4.2billion, but at the same time it received 
£2.5million in grants, its accounts show.

Part of this money came from Scottish Enterprise because of Amazon’s warehouse in Dunfermline in Fife.

Around £1.5million came from an EU grant to build a road to its Swansea warehouse.

A petition by local booksellers and 
with 166,000 signatures calling on the Government to ‘stop Amazon’s tax 
dodge’ was handed in to Downing Street last month.

Frances Smith, who runs two 
independent Kenilworth Books shops near Warwick and was one of the 
organisers of the petition, said: ‘It’s just not fair, they are playing 
by their own rules.’

A spokesman for Amazon said: ‘Amazon pays all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within.

‘Like many companies, Amazon has received assistance in relation to major investments in the UK.’
