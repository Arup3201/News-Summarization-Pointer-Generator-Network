The 84-year-old Powerball winner who won the $590.5 million jackpot in May, has decided to donate $2 million to fix the roof of a Maine high school in her hometown.

Gloria MacKenzie pocketed $278 million after taxes and has since bought a $1.2m seaside mansion in Jacksonville, Florida, leaving her with plenty more to spend.

The retiree from Maine has offered to write a check to repair Schenck High School's roof, under which her daughter teaches biology, the Bangor Daily News reported.

Happy trio: Gloria Mackenzie, the biggest ever USA lottery winner, leaves Crazy Egg restaurant in Florida, alongside her son Scott Mackenzie - toting takeout - and his partner Jerry Cruz.

The school's superintendent in East 
Millinocket, Quenten Clark, told the paper: 'They want their privacy 
respected, so I don't think they will have any comment publicly.

East Millinocket was MacKenzie's hometown before she became a Florida resident.

'They
take their heritage to heart when it comes to the town and helping the 
town out', school board Chairman Daniel Byron told the paper.

The school was built in 1957 and Mr Clark told NBC News' WCSH: 'I think without [the donation], the school was going to die.

'East
Millinocket was not going to have a school in the long run, and I think
with this we'll be able to keep the school going for a while.'

MacKenzie, who is the largest ever U.S. lottery winner,
has remained in the shadows since coming forward to claim her prize. 
She bought her winning ticket May 18 in Zephyrhills, where she lived in a
rental apartment.

Her son, Scott, 57, who had a standing agreement to split the
prize with his mother, also lives in Jacksonville.

Her new home is located in the gated Glen Kernan Country Club community in Ponte Vedra Beach and overlooks the club's golf course and a lake.

Built in 2002, it has a library, a movie theater, closets the size of small bedrooms and a screened-in pool.

MailOnline previously reported that Gloria MacKenzie was planning to buy a new home with Scott and his boyfriend, Jerry Cruz, 65, and that the three were planning to live together.

Scott MacKenzie's ex-wife had Ella previously told MailOnline, 'The three of them are going to be living together. Scott wanted to move 
in with his mom because he was worried about how she would cope on her 
own.'

Gloria, whose husband Ralph died in 2005, was forced to leave the trailer she had called home for 25 years to move into a run-down $30,000 bungalow in the small town of Zephyrhills, Florida, just one year ago.

She had pledged to split the winnings
with son Scott, as she was with him when she 
bought the $2 ticket at a Zephyrhills supermarket on May 18.

Gloria
has two sons, Larry and Scott, and two daughters, Melinda – known as 
Mindy – and Jaimie, and grandchildren Matthew, Alex, Scott and Lindsay, 
and two great-grandchildren, Victoria and Ethan.

Most
of her family remain in her home state of Maine and it remains unknown 
how, or if, she plans to share the jackpot with them.

According to lottery officials, Gloria opted to receive the lump sum of $278,172,585.40 48 hours after discovering she had won.

Gloria’s winning numbers, using random selection, were 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11.
