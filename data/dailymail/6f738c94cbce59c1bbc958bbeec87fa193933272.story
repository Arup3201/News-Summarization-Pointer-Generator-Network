Nottingham Forest thrashed Reading 4-0 at the City Ground to return to the top of the Championship table on Saturday.

Norwich City's 1-0 win at Ipswich earlier in the day had put the Canaries first for a couple of hours, but Michail Antonio, returning to haunt his former club, scored twice before Matty Fryatt and Britt Assombalonga rounded off the scoring to restore Stuart Pearce side's position at the summit.

Elsewhere, Jordan Rhodes, Grant Hanley and Rudy Gestede all netted for Blackburn as they raced into a 3-0 half time lead at home against Bournemouth. The Cherries seemed down and out before a Brett Pitman penalty and Steve Cook pulled them to within touching distance of a draw, but it wasn't quite enough as Gary Bowyer's side just held on for a 3-2 victory.

Bolton's poor start to the season continued as they went down to 2-1 at Brighton. Matt Mills put Dougie Freedman's side in front after 25 minutes, but Craig Mackail-Smith scored his first league goal since New Year's Day 2013 to level the scores before Joao Teixeira scored the winner in the second half.

Despite going down to ten men after Tony Craig felled Birmingham's Clayton Donaldson in the area after just 15 minutes, from which Paul Caddis scored the resulting penalty, Brentford fought their way back into the game to clinch a 1-1 draw through Moses Odubajo's late equaliser. 

Igor Vetokele scored a late equaliser for Charlton to  cancel out Nakhi Wells earlier effort for ten-man Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium, whilst Ben Pringle popped in the winner for Rotherham early on in the second half to hand Millwall their first defeat of the season.

Off the mark: Atdhe Nuhiu's brace for Sheffield Wednesday were his first Championship goals

Sheffield Wednesday secured an impressive win over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium, with an Atdhe Nuhiu brace sandwiching a Stevie May finish to give them a 3-2 win, with Grant Leadbitter scoring twice from the spot for the home side in the closing stages, whilst a last-minute Mark Hudson own goal gave Wolves a dramatic 1-0 win at home to Cardiff.

And finally, Fulham fell to their fourth defeat in as many games this season after being thrashed 5-1 by Derby, Leeds had two men sent off in a humbling 4-1 defeat away at Watford, and Wigan beat struggling Blackpool 1-0 to leave them second bottom of the table.
