Phil Taylor breezed through his first-round match at the World Darts Championship on Friday and then headed straight home to be with his ill mother.

The 16-time world champion brushed aside Jyhan Artut 3-0 before dashing up the motorway in the early hours to see his mum in hospital, who is suffering from a severe lung infection.

After his win, Taylor said: ‘My mum will be on the phone now, she’s so demanding. I’ll get a phone call on the way out with her asking “when are you coming to see me?” I will be there at 9 o’clock in the morning.

‘Mum is settled now, she has got a nice little care home and she’s lovely.’

But despite his personal issues and lack of practice, Taylor was in cruise control as he averaged 100.57 and checked out 60 per cent of his doubles.

‘Practice has been in second place,’ he admitted. ‘These things happen in life, but it is very tiring.

‘We will get through it. We have got a lovely family. My daughter Lisa and my son Christopher, they have been an absolute rock and, along with my son in law Justin, they’ve been with my mum ten out of 12 hours a day we could visit.’

Taylor’s victory against Artut, the world No 58 from Germany, was one of his most straight forward at Alexandra Palace.

He reeled off the first six legs of the match to race into a two-set lead before the German realised what had hit him.

Artut put up more of a fight in the third set as he finally won his first leg and, when trailing 2-1, he checked out 95 to break Taylor’s throw and save the match.

But in the deciding leg of the set, the 16-time world champion hit a 180 to leave 125 before setting up double 16 on his next visit to win the match. 

Taylor's performance showed why he is up there with the favourites for this year's title 

In the first match of Friday’s session, Andy Hamilton fought back from 2-1 down to beat Canadian Dave Richardson and win his first match in a premier event since the World Matchplay in July.

The 2012 World Championship finalist won the opening set before Richardson responded by taking the next two to leave Hamilton reeling.

But Hamilton found his form when it mattered most, winning six legs in a row to claim a 3-2 win and avoid a first-round upset.

He said: ‘In the last three or four tournaments I haven’t been playing bad but I just haven’t had results.

Richardson had led after three sets, but Hamilton stormed back with six consecutive legs to win the match 3-2

‘I have been playing well and been having games where I’m losing 6-5 and that knocks you down and takes your confidence.

‘Hopefully this will give me that much more confidence for the next game and I can go on from there. I’m going to enjoy Christmas now.’

In the final match of the evening, Sascha Stein upset No 32 seed Stuart Kellett 3-1 having earlier come through a preliminary round match.
