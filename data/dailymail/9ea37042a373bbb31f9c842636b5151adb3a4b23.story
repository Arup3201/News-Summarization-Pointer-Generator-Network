Mikel Arteta may have played his last game for Arsenal after he was sidelined for three months through injury. 

The Arsenal captain, who is out of contract at the end of the season, has been missing from first-team action since November after he was substituted in the 2-0 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund at the Emirates Stadium.

The 32-year-old was expected to be out for around a month but a subsequent problem with his ankle means rehabilitation will take 'approximately three months'.

Mathieu Debuchy will also be sidelined until April following shoulder surgery on the injury he sustained in Arsenal's 3-0 win against Stoke. 

The France international has only recently returned to action after he suffered an injury in the 2-2 draw against Manchester City at the Emirates in September.

'It's very unfortunate for Mathieu, it's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season,' said Arsene Wenger. 

Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his shoulder after colliding with Stoke's Marko Arnautovic in the 3-0 victory 

'He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again. I count three months out for Mathieu because contact will be a problem for the shoulder.'

On Arteta, manager Wenger added: 'Mikel has had surgery which went well. I have just seen him, he is back with us at the training ground.

'He had a limited mobility in his ankle and some persistent inflammation that had an impact on his calf.

'That meant we had to make the decision to have surgery and it's a proper solution which gives him the best chance to recover.'
