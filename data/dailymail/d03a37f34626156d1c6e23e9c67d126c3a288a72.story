This is the shocking moment a pregnant woman viciously attacked a stranger in the street because of her Scottish accent.

Kaily Amess, 22, dragged Wendy Barbour, 44, into the road and repeatedly punched her in the head after overhearing over accent while shopping in South Shields, South Tyneside.

Footage of Amess, who is due to have her baby next month, shows her pouncing on her unknowing victim before beating her repeatedly while a man stands by and encourages her.

The mother-to-be, who will now give birth in prison, attacked Mrs Barbour after hearing her accent while she spoke on the phone to her daughter as she walked down the street

The mother-to-be attacked Mrs Barbour after hearing her accent while she spoke on the phone to her daughter as she walked down the street.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how Amess told her victim to ‘take herself back to Scotland’ before launching the horrific attack.

Mrs Barbour, from Glasgow, was left lying in the middle of the road after the attack – with drivers and witnesses seemingly appearing to pass by without concern.

Her daughter, who remained on the line throughout the attack and heard the entire ordeal, is thought to have raised the alarm.

Mrs Barbour was left with black eyes, scrapes to her face, lumps and bumps to her head and blurred vision.

The court heard one of the facial injuries also left her with having the appearance of a ‘lazy eye’.

Her shopping was also stolen in the daylight attack which occurred in a quiet street last June.

Footage of the attack was today described by a judge as ‘truly shocking’.

Amess, of South Shields, admitted 
robbery and was jailed for two years at Newcastle Crown Court. It means 
she will give birth in prison.

Sentencing her, Judge John Evans said: ‘You engaged in the attack without reason and without any mercy.

'All of this, apparently, because she had chosen her own, natural accent when addressing her daughter on the telephone.

'Already an arthritis sufferer, this was a both terrifying and very painful experience for her and left her with scars on her cheek and forehead.

'You are heavily pregnant, you appear to have fallen pregnant shortly after these events.

'By your own behaviour you have condemned yourself to spend the first years of your child’s life, an otherwise joyful occasion, in custody.

'It has to be understood that those who chose to behave in this outrageous fashion are going to go to custody, whatever their personal circumstances.'

Two men who encouraged Amess behaviour and hurled race-hate abuse at Mrs Barbour were branded 'cowards' by the judge.

Prosecutor Liam O’Brien told the court Mrs Barbour was verbally abused and called a 'Scottish b******' on her way to her local shop prior to the incident last June and was scared she was about to be beaten up.

Mr O'Brien said: ‘A male shouted “go on Kaily, left and right her”.

‘The defendant threw a punch to the complainant's head, causing her to drop her bags to the pavement then she pulled her to the floor.

‘While on the pavement she was straddled by the defendant and punched repeatedly in the head.

‘She attempted to get up but one of the males assisted the defendant, grabbing hold of the complainant's legs, pulling her from the pavement onto the road.

‘The defendant continued to punch her about the head and torso.

‘Her daughter had to hear the sound of her mother being shouted at and then assaulted. Clearly it was a very upsetting thing for her to deal with and she sped to the hospital to see her mother.’

Mr O'Brien said the victim believes she was targeted due to her Scottish accent.

He told the court: ‘She thinks this was a racial incident due to her Scottish accent and indeed it would appear this is a racially aggravated offence.’

Lewis Kerr, defending, said Amess had turned her life around since the incident and added: ‘She is disgusted by her own behaviour.’
