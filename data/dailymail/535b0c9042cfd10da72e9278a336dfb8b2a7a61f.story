The body of a patient who went missing from San Francisco General Hospital two weeks ago has been found - still on the premises in a disused stairwell.

The hospital is now frantically trying
to get to the bottom of how Lynne Spalding, who disappeared from her room on September 21, went undiscovered for so long.

Her dead body was found yesterday by an employee in the stairwell, which is used as a fire escape.

Frantic: Staff at the hospital are trying to establish how the body of Lynne Spalding was overlooked for so long

Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said they did not know either how long the mother-of-two had been left lying there, nor how she had come to be on the fire escape in the first place, according to Associated Press.

She added: 'It's very concerning. We're distressed and don't know what happened. It's our top 
priority to find out.'

The cause of her death is now being investigated by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department and police.

A police investigation was launched after the 57-year-old British woman first went missing.

The disorientated mother-of-two had been admitted to the hospital for complications to an infection and was being monitored by staff every 15 minutes, but disappeared between check-ups.

At the time of her disappearance, family spokesman David Perry told ABC that Ms Spalding was on medication, which could have caused her to become disorientated.Â 

Mr Perry said: 'We find it disturbing 
that someone can go missing from the hospital. One would think there 
would be cameras or something.'

Ms Spalding, who was originally from the UK but lived in San Francisco, worked in tourism in the West Coast city.

She was divorced with two children, a 23-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son.
