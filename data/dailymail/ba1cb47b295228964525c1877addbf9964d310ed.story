Forget stained carpets, or cold marble floors, a vibrant blue pond ripples beneath the feet of guests at one rustic retreat in Bali.

Holidaymakers wake up to a stunning underwater panorama in one of the most unique sleeping quarters in the world, in the Udang 'shrimp' House at Bambu Indah hotel in Bali.

But visitors mustn't be shy if they want to stay in the eco-friendly bolt-hole, as there is an abundance of fish swimming under the room - and perhaps peering up through the tempered glass floor.

The stunning suite, built from teak timbers, features a low mosquito-netted four-poster bed, which stands becomingly in the middle of the room.

A rustic boat paddle and fishing net lay at the end of the bed as numerous crustaceans swim around below. 

The room also boasts an open-air shower so guests can truly feel at one with nature.
