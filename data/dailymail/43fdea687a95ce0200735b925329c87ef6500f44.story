It took an uncomfortable motivational speech from a few unknown fans at Stoke railway station to knock Arsenal into some kind of shape. 

It was horribly personal towards Arsene Wenger and I have huge sympathy with the Gunners manager for the abuse he had to suffer in those circumstances after the 3-2 defeat.

But it did the job Wenger seems incapable of. It got the players playing for him, and it even got the Emirates crowd singing his name after Saturday’s win over Newcastle.

Of course, Arsenal have a habit of smashing inferior opponents and then failing badly when it matters, so let’s see how the revival against Galatasaray and then Newcastle works out going forward. 

And what a stroke of good fortune when the Gunners picked out Monaco in the Champions League draw. If they don’t get through that Wenger should resign on the spot and hang his head in shame.

But against a backdrop of embarrassing defending, lack of leadership, strange tactics, fans arguing and even fighting among themselves, and a manager being abused by the club’s own supporters, one player has stood out with his quality, his attitude and his demeanour.

I’ve seen Arsenal several times this season and on each occasion the Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has played well, I’ve never seen his shoulders slump when things were going wrong, I’ve never seen him abandon the sinking ship.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been one of Arsenal's star performers this season

Oxlade-Chamberlain never lets his head drop when playing for Arsenal 

What I love about the way he plays is that he is so dynamic: every time he gets the ball I sense that something exciting is going to happen. And he’s not a one-trick Ox either. He can run with the ball, he can spot and execute a pass – and a killer pass to - he can cross, and he can finish.

He played the full 90 minutes in Turkey and then produced a man-of-the-match performance against Newcastle.

In the Premier League or the Champions League the Ox has proved he can play in different positions and still produce quality. And he can change a game – I was in Rio in 2013 when he came on as sub and transformed England from a side being overrun by Brazil, to a team dominating the game. He also scored a wondergoal in the Maracana that day.

Oxlade-Chamberlain seems to have the ability to perform at whatever level and on whatever stage you ask him and it was England’s misfortune he was injured for the World Cup – I believe he could have made a difference. So did Roy Hodgson, that’s why he took the gamble and took the Ox to Brazil in the summer. Sadly it didn’t work out.

In my view he should be playing regularly for Arsenal – he’s been in and out of the line-up this season but has started the last four games – and should be a permanent fixture for England.

He rarely has a bad game, is usually a threat and so far in his career he has conducted himself impeccably.

Future captaincy material? I’d say so.

One final thought on Arsenal’s win over Newcastle: a decent display from Santi Cazorla, and some have given him credit for staying on his feet in the box instead of going down screaming for a penalty.

But what I didn’t like from Cazorla was the dinked penalty at the end. Some call it cheeky, I call it disrespectful and unprofessional.

Cazorla should have shown more respect when taking his penalty 

Jak Alnwick is a rookie keeper, Newcastle United’s third choice, on his full debut he’s already had to pick the ball out of the net three times, and knows he’s likely to have to do it again as he sets himself for Cazorla’s penalty.

I’ve no problem with the Spaniard scoring the penalty – of course not. But why is he so keen to humiliate and embarrass a young fellow professional?

It lacked class and there was simply no need for it.

Cazorla could learn from the Germans who chose to take their foot off the gas against Brazil in the World Cup semi-final – that could have been double figures easily.

The Spaniard is a good player – he doesn’t need to resort to such nonsense.
