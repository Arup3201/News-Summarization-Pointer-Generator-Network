Chilling footage of the Navy Yard shooter as he stalked random victims through hallways with a sawed-off shotgun has been released by the FBI today.

There is no indication that Aaron Alexis targeted any specific individuals when he sprayed bullets inside a building, killing 12 people on September 16.

In the short clip, Alexis is first seen 
driving into an underground parking garage in his rental car, a blue 
Toyota Prius, through the Washington Navy Yard main gate in DC.

He then is caught on camera entering 
building 197 carrying a backpack. Alexis had legitimate access to the 
Washington Navy Yard as a result of his work as a contractor and he used
a valid pass to enter.

In the next heart-stopping segment, Alexis creeps through hallways and bounds down a stairwell carrying a Remington 870 shotgun.

As he jogs down one corridor, people can be seen moving at speed through a doorway at the opposite end.

Valerie Parlave, head of the FBIâ€™s field
office in Washington, said on Wednesday during a news conference that 
investigators are continuing to explore the background and motivations 
of 34-year-old Alexis.

The former Navy employee had a well-documented history of mental health issues.

Parlave says Alexis held a delusional belief that he was being controlled by extremely low frequency waves, or ELF waves.

Alexis had written 'my ELF weapon' on a shotgun he used in the rampage. He also had the words: 'Better off this way!' etched on the side.

The gunman, a former Navy reservist and IT consultant, was later shot dead by 
responding officers after he opened fire inside a Navy facility around 
8.20am on September 16, killing 12 people.

He
was killed in one of several running gun battles with police after he 
entered the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters and started picking 
off victims in a cafeteria from a fourth-floor atrium, witnesses said.

Pandemonium
ensued, with fire alarms sounding and security officers yelling at 
people to leave the building. Hundreds fled, some scrambling over walls 
to escape the gunfire.

A loudspeaker announcement ordered those who remained to shelter in place in their offices.

Aaron Alexis, 34, had a history of mental illness and had previously been arrested over shooting incidents, it emerged in the aftermath of the Navy Yard massacre

The motive for the mass shooting - 
the deadliest on a military installation in the U.S. since the tragedy 
at Fort Hood, Texas in 2009 - was a mystery, investigators said.

But
a profile of Alexis, was coming into focus. He was described as a 
Buddhist who had also had flares of rage, complained about the Navy and 
being a victim of discrimination and had several run-ins with law 
enforcement, including two shootings.

Those killed were aged 46 to 73, he said. Investigations continued into the circumstances of their deaths.

They are, according to Washington's 
Metropolitan Police Department: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; 
Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73;Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth 
Bernard Proctor, 46; Arthur Daniels, 51 and Vishnu Pandit, 61.

Investigators had pursued a possible second gunman but later said there were no suspects beyond Alexis.

The
incident has raised questions about security at the Washington Navy 
Yard, about a mile south of the U.S. Capitol and three miles from the White 
House.
