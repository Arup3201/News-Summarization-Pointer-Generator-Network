It has faced its fair share of criticism but the second series of Broadchurch finally seems to have broken through to audiences.

After five weeks in which ratings plummeted by 2.5million, Monday’s episode appears to have turned a corner, attracting 5.8million viewers, one million more than the previous instalment.

Although the ITV drama has been accused of taking liberties with its depiction of police investigations and court proceedings, fans appear to have embraced the chaos, prompting the spike in ratings.  

Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, seems to have turned a corner in the ratings

However, it is still not being given an easy ride, with viewers questioning the accuracy of how it portrayed the medical condition of one of its main characters.

With David Tennant’s downtrodden police detective going into hospital to have a pacemaker fitted, it was meant to be a dramatic highlight in the middle of the series.

And with the character updating his will, warning his former wife he might die and even experiencing an eerie dream sequence while under the knife, the sense of jeopardy was markedly ramped up.

But audiences did not have quite the reaction that would have been hoped for, pointing out medical inaccuracies and claiming that the procedure is not as dangerous as viewers were led to believe.

One wrote: ‘Wife been yelling at the TV. Oi, Broadchurch you don’t have a general anaesthetic for a pacemaker fitting. Wife does it for a living.’ 

And another pointed out: ‘Oh Broadchurch, having a pacemaker put in is NOT that big a deal. My 80 year old mom was a better patient than you, Hardy.’

A third placed it in a long line of criticisms that has seen the programme’s second series rounded on by lawyers, who have taken issue with the portrayal of court proceedings.

Law-student Rachel Constable tweeted: ‘Oh dear. I have a horrible feeling that pacemaker patients are about to be misrepresented as much as the legal system is!’

Despite these concerns, the episode was the most watched since the second series began last month. 

Monday’s episode marked a significant jump after what had been a steady period of decline throughout the hit show’s second run.

There are risks associated with having a pacemaker fitted, including infections and blood clots. 

However, while it can be used to treat serious conditions, the procedure itself is seen as relatively safe, with some patients even allowed home on the same day as their surgery.
