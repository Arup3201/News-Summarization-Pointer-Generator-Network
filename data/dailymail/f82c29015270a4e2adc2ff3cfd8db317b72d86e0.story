He'd been abusive several times throughout their four-year relationship.

'He has threatened to hurt her if she ever contacted police or told

during their relationship.'

A truck matching the description of Sanchez's white Dodge pickup with Texas plates was parked outside the murder-suicide crime scene.

Weld County sheriff's spokesman Tim 
Schwartz says dispatchers heard the woman's final cries of 'No, no, no,'
before multiple gunshots were fired.

Schwartz says a man then grabbed the phone and said he was going to kill himself before dispatchers heard another shot.

One of many seen rushing to the scene today was Eddy Silva who identified two of the gunman's victims as her nieces.

Ms Silva named Beatriz Cintora-Silva and sister Maria Cintora-Silva as the two women killed though they have yet to be identified by police.

She said Beatriz had moved into her sister's home out of fear of Daniels, and that Maria was a newlywed only married a few months.

Maria's husband was Max Aguirre.

All of the name's Ms Silva gave matched those listed in Sanchez's arrest report.

Daniels, Aguirre, Beatriz Cintora-Silva and Maria Cintora-Silva were all found dead in the house after the 911 call.

Neighbor George Vibbert said that Maria and Max were planning to have children.

Eddy Silva told the Post that she didn't know Maria's husband all that well.

A
SWAT team entered the home just after 4am MST and found the four bodies
in the subdivision east of Longmont - about 35 miles north of Denver.

Schwartz says investigators have a possible motive for the shootings, but he refused to release details.

Police don't believe anyone escaped alive.

'I'm very angry and sad,' Eddy Silva told the Post. 'They were good girls. They were responsible. I believed in them.'

Schwartz was not sure if there had been any previous calls to police at the home asking for help.

A handgun believed to be the murder weapon was recovered with numerous rounds reported fired from it.

Police are convinced the gunman was one of the victims.
