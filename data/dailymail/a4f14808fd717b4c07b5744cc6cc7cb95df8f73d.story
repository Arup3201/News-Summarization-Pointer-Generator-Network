A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after an eight-year-old girl was found dead in a block of flats.

Police were called to the property in Chadwell Heath, East London, by London Ambulance Service who were attending an 'incident' at the home yesterday morning.

Officers found the body of the girl 
at the scene and arrested a woman - understood to be the child's mother -
on suspicion of murder.

Investigation: A policeman stands outside the flat in Bedwell House, East London where an eight-year-old girl died yesterday

Custody: A 34-year-old woman has been arrested after the death of the child

She was treated for minor injuries in hospital and remains in custody at an east London police station.

Witnesses described a second woman leaving the flat with police in floods of tears.

A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out by Great Ormond Street Hospital to establish the cause of death.

Neighbours say there were two women living at the flat with the girl and a young boy aged around six-years-old.

Tributes have been left at the flat, 
which is being guarded by a uniformed police officer, including a bunch 
of carnations and roses by a local resident.

A card reads: 'In memory of a little girl whom I would never have met. From a neighbour, rest in peace. Amen.'

Resident Atik Molla, 39, said: 'There
were two women living at the flat and the girl and a boy around six 
years old, who I think was the girl’s brother.

'We saw them quite a lot and they were always looking happy.

'We are very shocked by this, they seemed like a normal family. I think the mother was originally from India or Pakistan.'

The eight-year-old girl moved into 
the flat which she shared with her mother and another woman - both 
described as British Asian - around four months ago and went to a local 
school.

Taxi driver Adeel Mushtaq, 31, who 
lives upstairs from the girl’s flat, said: 'I set off for a job at 
around 11am and saw the woman having a smoke at the back of the flat.

'I was just passing by and she seemed perfectly fine. She said ‘hello’.

'Then I arrived back at around 12.30pm and saw police vans and officers. I saw her crying. She was hysterical and trembling.

Sympathy: A neighbour has left a floral tribute after the tragic discovery of the dead girl

Emergency: Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service at around 11.38am yesterday

'She was getting into an unmarked 
car. Some plain-clothed officials were leading her into it - it looked 
like they were police - one woman was propping her up as she got in.

'She was crying, just weeping. She 
wasn’t saying anything. Then they just drove away. When I came in I saw 
police were in her flat and I found out the girl was dead.

'It’s so shocking, just awful.'

Another resident, who declined to be named, said: 'It makes you shudder when you walk through the door and see the police.

'My heart goes out to that girl. The 
women seemed nice. I used to see them take the girls off to school in 
the mornings and we would say hello, but nothing more.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said this 
morning: 'We are still waiting for a post mortem to be scheduled before 
giving any further information.

'As the victim was a child, it has to be done by Great Ormond Street Hospital so we don’t know if it will be carried out today.

'A 34-year-old woman remains in custody at an east London police station. She was arrested on suspicion of murder.'
