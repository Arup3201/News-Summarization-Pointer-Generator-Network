Less than 24 hours after Harry Kane scored a match-winning brace for Tottenham in the north London derby, a photo has emerged of him  celebrating Arsenal's Invincibles Premier League title win in 2004.

It is the second picture to have arisen of Kane in an Arsenal shirt, the other showed him in a team photo as a eight-year-old playing for the Gunners' youth team.

Kane, who has scored 22 goals for Spurs in all competitions this season, explained the incident last time by saying he only did it because he had to and had always been a Tottenham fan in reality.

'I wanted to wear a Tottenham kit but I don't think that would've gone down to well,' said Kane.

'I was eight-years-old. I was at Arsenal for a year and obviously I was a kid, I just wanted to play football. 

'I've been at Spurs since I was 11-years-old, always loved the club. I've been here 10 years and hopefully many more years to come.'

Kane, who would have been two months shy of his 11th birthday at the time, can be seen at the parade celebrating the Invincibles' remarkable success in 2004.

And his dyed red hair, in the style of former Arsenal star Freddie Ljungberg, is sure to annoy Tottenham fans who chant that Kane is 'one of their own'.

The 21-year-old stole the show in Saturday's clash at White Hart Lane, scoring twice after Mesut Ozil's opener to secure all three points for Mauricio Pochettino's side.

But for some Tottenham fans this latest revelation may just take the edge off their glee.
