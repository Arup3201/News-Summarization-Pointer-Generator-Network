Deputy: Ricky Hernandez, a deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, had a close encounter with some bears during a recent vehicle inspection in a California forest 

Ricky Hernandez's team observed a bear on the ground while the deputy was being dropped out of a helicopter so he could examine a vehicle that had been deserted

The team members' attempts to alert Hernandez to the bear failed because they 'lost radio contact,' KABC reported. The bear sped into the forest since it was scared of the helicopter, according to the affiliate station.

Still, Hernandez was in for a shock when he peered inside the car Sunday and came face to face with some bear cubs that had made themselves at home.

'The vehicle was all torn up,' Hernandez told KABC. 'All the headliners and the upholstery and everything was all cut up and made into like a nest, and - so I entered the vehicle, I crawled into it.

'It was up on its roof. When I got inside, I noticed two bear cubs, or three bear cubs, inside there.'

He told the affiliate station the car did not contain any human remains.

Hernandez was removed by deputies following a short probe, according to KABC.

The sheriff's department's Special Enforcement Bureau tweeted on the incident, writing '#LASD Air 5 drops deputy to check stolen car over side, Chantry Flats, ANF. Bear jumps from car & runs. No pursuit.'
