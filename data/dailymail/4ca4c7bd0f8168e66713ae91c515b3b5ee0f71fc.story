Her tenth holiday in a year: Coleen Rooney in Barbados yesterday

When Wayne and Coleen Rooney bulldozed a 1930s mansion and replaced it with a sprawling £5million neo-Georgian palace, locals accused them of wrecking their affluent corner of Cheshire.

Now, however, the boot is on the other foot – after Mrs Rooney complained over plans to build 15 homes near the pair’s 20-acre estate.

In a letter to Cheshire East Council, Coleen, 28, warns: ‘Let’s not ruin our village. The development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land.

'The development will mean more car journeys into the village, which is already congested and unsuitable for the increased traffic. It will damage the special landscape, character and appearance of the area.’ 

The plans would see 15 homes built on Green Belt land owned by Harvey Wood Investments, including five 'affordable' homes, with one of the builds visible from the end of her drive. 

She also wrote: 'There is No evidence of very special circumstances required to override the harm to the Green Belt – the absence of a 5 year housing land supply in Cheshire East does not constitute very special circumstances.'

Mrs Rooney added that she also had concerns over 'highway safety' because of poor visibility along the proposed estate's main access road.

The Rooneys bought their eight-bedroom pile in 2013, not far from the home of Wes Brown

Her objections have been backed by nearly 60 neighbours, including former Manchester United defender Wes Brown's wife Leanne and ex-Slade rocker Noddy Holder's wife Suzan.

Mrs Holder wrote: 'I can see no 'very special circumstances' that would be the only way to justify the destruction of this green belt area for the purpose of building any number of new houses. Prestbury is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting.'

However not everyone is on Mrs Rooney's side. One resident of the affluent neighbourhood said: 'It's a bit rich coming from her her. 

'When she and Wayne moved here she bought a very attractive house and then knocked it down and replaced it with a monstrosity and put huge gates round it. It looks like they're living in a prison.'

Coleen Rooney, pictured on another holiday in Barbados, where she and Wayne own a second home, objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would 'ruin' her village

Planning chiefs will make a decision on the application next month, but Richard Morris, representing Harvey Wood Investments, held little hope of the plans being given the green light.

He said: 'I think it's likely that the application will be rejected. There have been 50 or 60 objections to it.

'Mrs Rooney's home is nearby but she cannot quite see our site. 

'From what I understand her site is quite large. There was some upset when she had building work done too, but that was a completely different scenario.'

Such comments were unlikely to have troubled Coleen yesterday – she was enjoying her tenth holiday of the past year, this time at the couple’s £5 million villa in Barbados where she often takes her sons Kai, four, and one-year-old Klay.

Wayne, meanwhile, is still at home while serving a three match suspension from playing for Manchester United.
