Neil Lennon was confirmed as the new manager of Championship strugglers Bolton Wanderers on Sunday.

The former Celtic boss beat off fierce competition including former Parkhead idol Paolo di Canio and Chris Hughton to land the job at the Macron Stadium.

Lennon was officially offered the post by chairman Phil Gartside on Sunday lunchtime and will be paraded at a media conference on Monday.

Currently propping up the Championship after winning just one game all season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Dougie Freedman this month.

Lennon has been out of the game since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell.

Despite working as a TV pundit, he has never hidden his desire to return to the dugout as soon as the right job became available. Garry Parker and Johan Mjallby, his trusted lieutenants at Celtic Park, will now join him in the north west. It’s believed Lennon has signed a three-year deal with a further one-year option.

A Bolton statement confirmed the 43-year-old’s appointment, saying: ‘The club are delighted and excited to appoint Neil Lennon. He brings with him experience at the highest level and an infectious enthusiasm to take the club forward.

‘He will officially take charge of the team from Monday morning in the run-up to our upcoming game away at Birmingham City.’

Lennon said: ‘There’s a good structure at the club. I know the stadium well and there are some good players at the club.

‘I have a big job on my hands to get Bolton up the table. The financial state of the club never came up. I will play a style of football that will please the Bolton fans.’

Lennon had been due to travel to Saudi Arabia last week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to go to Jeddah.

Whilst a wage of more than £2million a year was attractive, Lennon had reservations about moving to the Middle East in terms of his career development. The challenge of securing Bolton’s place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing.

Despite Bolton’s £168m debt — a legacy of their relegation from the Premier League two years ago — Lennon is enthused at the prospect of returning them to former glories.

His name was under consideration at fellow Championship strugglers Fulham but, with caretaker Kit Symons steadying the ship at Craven Cottage, that door remained closed.

Lennon’s four years in the Celtic hotseat brought three successive Scottish Premiership titles, two Scottish Cups and qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, that included a win over Spanish giants Barcelona.

But Lennon will be hoping to do better than the two Celtic managers who preceded him who both ended up in the Championship without success. In 2010, Gordon Strachan resigned after less than a year at Middlesbrough with the club in 20th and Tony Mowbray was sacked by Boro in October 2013 with the team languishing in 16th.
