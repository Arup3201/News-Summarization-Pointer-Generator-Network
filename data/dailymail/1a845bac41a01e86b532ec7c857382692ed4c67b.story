A police officer in Arizona has been the subject of controversy after his daughter’s elementary school told him to not wear his uniform when one the school property.

The ban came after parents complained that the Coolidge police officer, Scott Urkov, had brought his child to Entz Elementary School in Mesa wearing his uniform and carrying a gun.

According to school officials, the principal asked Urkov not to bring his gun to school anymore as parents were ‘concerned’.

Controversy: Police officer Scott Urkov, with his two daughters, whose faces cannot be shown due to their age. Urkov was told not to wear his uniform and gun to the school

Outrage: Urkov posted on his Facebook wall that he couldn't believe he was asked not to wear his uniform at the school

‘Some parents were concerned about the fact that there was a fully armed officer on campus and they spoke to the principal about it,’ Helen Hollands, a spokesperson for Mesa Unified School District, told KSAZ.

Urkov was in shock, according to his Facebook wall.

‘Nothing like your kids school calling and asking if I could not come to pick up my daughter in uniform cause parents were concerned when their kids came home telling them there was a man at school with a gun. Are you freaking kidding me?’ Urkov wrote on Facebook the day after the incident.

Some parents were surprised by the request. ‘If my kids saw that, I think they'd feel more protected to see a man in uniform at their school,’ parent Blaine Spencer said.

'Concerned': Helen Hollands, a spokesperson for Mesa Unified School District, said parents at the school had complained about Urkov's uniform and gun

'No uniforms allowed': Entz Elementary School in Mesa, Arizona, where Urkov was asked not to wear his police outfit

Urkov has since been invited to come to the school to do a talk about what police officers do in the community

Urkov has since been invited to return to the school and turn the incident into a ‘teachable moment’ and speak at a special assembly about what police officers do in the community.

But some people have expressed outrage over the school’s decision and have posted their opinions on their Facebook page. 

‘As a police officer I would have certainly been offended if I was asked to not wear my uniform and gun while dropping off my child at school,’ David Tedrow posted.

‘If parents cannot distinguish a police uniform, then they need to be educated, not the officer.’

According to another person, Tim Johnson, the decision showed ‘ignorance and lack of sound reasoning skills by the school principal and district administrators’.
