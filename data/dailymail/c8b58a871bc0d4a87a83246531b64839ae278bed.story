It was inspired by a show famed for its sex and scandal. But it's safe to say the Mormon version of The Bachelor will more respectable than raunchy.

Viewers can now tune in to a dating show featuring romance with a more wholesome twist.

The Mormon Bachelor aims to help two people find marriage and eternal love - and the star of the show is a 26-year-old virgin Chris Barbour.

Currently broadcast over the internet, the series is now in its fourth season and has attracted a growing online audience.

However, it's a far cry from the risqu√© content of the mainstream television version The Bachelor Pad, on ABC, in which contestants ended up naked in a pool with each other in the season premiere.

According to ABC News, Chris said: 'Mormons don't engage in sexual activity before marriage. You have the physical kisses and what not, but past that, not too much.

'We definitely do have our standards and
our guidelines that we go by, that we try to live by, as much as we 
possibly can. I don't even like to kiss on the first date.'

The reality series has a Mormon-majority audience and, some might say, it would be given seal of approval from the most famous Mormon in the U.S. - Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

The shows is the creation of two Mormon members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), ABC News reported.

Aubrey Laidlaw and Erin Elton were 
frustrated with the dating scene and came up with the idea when the 
moved to Southern California after graduating from Brigham Young 
University.

Erin added: 'Our dating practices are so different than the dating practices of mainstream. Holding hands and kissing, which is not very passionate is pretty much all you can do before you're married.'

Aubrey was a fan of the ABC show The Bachelor and auditioned for it.

However, she said the fact she did not make it on to the final line-up was probably a blessing in disguise as she actually wanted to marry someone of LDS faith.

Instead, she came up with the concept of the web-broadcast Mormon Bachelorette, casting herself in the first season.

Aubrey ended up marrying the suitor she was matched with in the show while Erin is due to marry her beau next week.

The two women are now studying audition tapes of LDS suitors hoping to win the affections of Chris in the show's fourth season.
