Every Dog has its day. But Sleeping Dogs will have many of them.

For this is a game with a bite that’s just as ferocious as its bark. A peek into an organisation bound by honour, blood and respect.

An unflinching look into the gritty underworld that rewards loyalty with riches, and punishes betrayal by death.

Human shield: You'll often have to use any means necessary to get out alive

Enter Detective Wei Shen from the San Francisco PD – who’s been seconded to the Hong Kong Police Force. Wei’s tasked with the (unenviable) task of going undercover and infiltrating the Sun On Yee Triads and take them down.

But as Wei goes deeper into the underworld, the lines defining good and evil blur, testing both his honour to the mission and to the triad.

Indeed, there’s a clear nod to Asian cinematic masterpiece Infernal Affairs in the storyline. And that’s no bad thing. Sleeping Dogs portrays a sense of isolation and fear like no other game of recent years. 

You’ll constantly be worried if your actions will blow your cover, whilst the characters are all so well-developed, you’ll feel emotionally-distraught when you’re forced to betray them.

Sleeping Dogs is an open-world game, played in an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective.

And although the inevitable comparison with Grand Theft Auto will be made, it has got a very different feel to it than Rockstar's masterpiece.

A large reason for that is the brilliant hand-to-hand combat - strongly influenced by Batman: Arkham City's 'Freeflow' system.

Chase is on: Expect some fantastic vehicle combat

Press the attack button and Wei dishes out a series of kicks and punches. If an enemy flashes red, a tap of a button sees Wei counter.

Unlike Arkham City, though, Wei can use the environment to dish out some lethal takedowns. These include impaling enemies on swordfish heads, throwing them off buildings, amd crushing them with car engines.

A clever levelling up system, where you find certain statues to unlock more moves, stops the combat feeling repetitive. 

Then there's the gunplay, which plays like Gears of War spliced with a bit of Max Payne.

Primarily cover-based, you'll get to use a variety of weapons from pistols to machine guns, and can turn on slow motion when performing certain manoeuvres - such as skidding over a table or vaulting over a ledge. 

This makes for very stylised combat, although it’s not quite as rewarding and precise as you would want.

You'll often accidentally leap out of cover, only to be blasted into oblivion and aiming can be quite fiddly at times. AI is sharp, and enemies will flank you, but they’ll often bob up and down and expose the tops of their heads from cover.

Driving around the city is huge fun. Cars handle well and really come into their own in car chases and races. There's a clear Need For Speed and Burnout influence on show here.

You can ram cars off the road, shoot out their tyres and pull off high-speed car-jacks. However, the arcade feel of the car chases can take away from the serious (and often harrowing) storyline.

Burnout: There's more than a bit of Need For Speed about the street racing

It can jar when Wei's confronted with, say, a massacre, only to watch him jump into a car with dodge 'em style-handling and the damage threshold of a small tank. But that's not to say the driving isn't fun.

There’s a clever experience point system in place, too. This is broken up into Triad XP, Face XP and Police XP. After each mission, you're awarded points to spend on both police upgrades - such as disarming enemies, and triad upgrades, often involving neat combat manoeuvres.

Go through a mission mowing down innocent people and your police points will suffer, so you'll have to play sensibly to maximise the chance of getting all the upgrades.

Face XP is a measure of his reputation - the higher the value, the more clothes and flash cars become available. Non-playable characters will react differently to you, too.

There's also plenty of side missions. You can take part in car-jacking, street races, karaoke, gambling, street fighting and taking girls out on dates to name just a few.

Each one offers up its own unique reward.

Then there's the presentation. Voice acting is spot on, featuring brilliant performances from Tom Wilkinson and Lucy Liu.

Graphics are sharp but poor draw distance is issue. Lip synching is not great at times, too (especially during the karaoke sections). On the whole, though, the game looks stunning.

Lock and load: Wei will get to use a variety of different, high-powered weapons

Gameplay is helped along by a classy soundtrack serving up techno, classics, jazz and disco.

It’s a shame developers Square Enix haven’t added a multiplayer component to take advantage of their beautiful recreation of Hong Kong. Especially because the single-player game clocks in at a (quite modest) 14 hours.

It may be tempting to see Sleeping Dogs as a stop-gap before GTA V hits the shelves. But do so at your peril.

Because this is a masterpiece. A brilliant Far East adventure that deserves to be appreciated in its own right.
