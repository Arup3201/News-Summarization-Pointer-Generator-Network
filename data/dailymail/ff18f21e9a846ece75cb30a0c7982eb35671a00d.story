A group of Merseyside nurses were treated to a Christmas surprise by Everton manager Roberto Martinez at Goodison Park on Tuesday.

Taken on a tour of the stadium by club legend Graeme Sharp, the 28 nurses -  all Evertonians - were initially  at the home of the Blues under the pretence they were attending a corporate event.

However, if one surprise wasn't enough, they were greeted by Toffees boss Martinez when they reached the Goodison dressing room.

Each nurse received a 'Blue Hero' award and special gift from the Spaniard.

The group were also invited for a special three-course dinner in the club's premier Dixie Dean Suite to reward them for their remarkable dedication to caring for the region's most vulnerable.

Martinez said: 'It's one of those days that we, as a football club, are so proud to be able to give some good feeling back to many, many special people. What they do on a daily basis is so important and so vital for everyone in the community, for everyone in the city and Merseyside as a whole.

'For us to highlight many Evertonians that are special with their commitment and time on a daily basis and affecting so many families in the right manner and in special times is wonderful. Working in a hospital is a significant time for anyone, it always shocks you when you have to be in a hospital and people like the Blue Heroes that we recognise today make that time different and what they give back is quite unique.

'We've been delighted to be able to recognise them for what they do and wish them a very special Christmas.'

Every hospital across the region was asked to nominate nurses who were fans of the blue half of Merseyside as Everton continue their 'Blue Crimbo' campaign, which sees the Toffees rewarding deserving members of the local community. 

The Toffees, already through to the knockout stages of the Europa League, host Russian side Krasnodar on Thursday night in their final group match.
