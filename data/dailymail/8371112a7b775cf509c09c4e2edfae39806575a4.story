The grandparents of Olympic diver Tom Daley have expressed their surprise at their grandson's revelation he is in a relationship with a man - but have vowed to support him.

The 19-year-old announced the news that he is in a ‘serious’ relationship with a man and ‘couldn’t be happier' in a five-minute message on YouTube yesterday.

His grandparents, whom he told 24 hours before he went public, said the news came ‘out of the blue’ and they feared he was ‘too young to be making this sort of decision’ but vowed to support him.

David and Rosemary Daley – whose son 
Robert, Daley’s father, died in 2011 from brain cancer at the age of 40 –
 also admitted they were a little ‘confused’ by the news.

Mrs Daley, 65, of Plymstock, Devon, 
said: ‘We only found out at 5pm on Sunday when he came to see us. We are
 confused because he’s always had girlfriends.

'We asked him if he was absolutely sure. He’s our first grandson from our son who died.

'Not been an easy decision': Tom tweeted a link to the video on Monday morning

Setting the record straight: Tom insisted he wanted to break the news in a video so his words could not be twisted and his fans would know the truth

'We
 have always been supportive of him and we always will. We’re not 
old-fashioned, in fact we’re quite liberal. But I do think he’s too 
young to be making this sort of decision.

‘But we hugged him, we thanked him for coming to see us, and we’ll be seeing him over Christmas. We’ll always be here for Tom.’

Mr
 Daley, 66, a former company director, added: ‘We’ve always been loyal 
supporters of Tom and there’s no reason that that will change.’

Still as motivated as ever: Tom insisted that the new relationship has done nothing to stop his motivation ahead of the Rio Olympic games in 2016

In
 his YouTube video, Daley said his mother Debbie already knew and had 
been very supportive, but added: ‘I told the rest of my family today 
and, well, let’s just say they had mixed opinions. Lots of them wanted 
me to keep it quiet.’

'He would be happy for me': Tom insisted his late father Rob would be proud of him no matter what

Speaking
 in the clip, the London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist said he ‘still 
fancies girls’ but had been dating an unnamed man since spring.

In
 his video message, Daley said: ‘I’ve been dating girls and I’ve never 
really had a serious relationship to talk about and now I feel ready to 
talk about my relationships.

'Come
 spring this year my life changed massively when I met someone and it 
made me feel so happy, so safe, and everything just feels great. And, 
well, that someone – is a guy.’

He
 admitted that ‘it did take me by surprise a little bit’ but ‘something 
just clicked’ and ‘it felt right’, adding: ‘My whole world just changed 
there and then.

'Of 
course I still fancy girls but, I mean, right now I’m dating a guy and I
 couldn’t be happier. It feels safe and it really does feel right.’

Ending
 months of speculation about his sexuality, he said he realised his 
admission was ‘going to be big’ news, but told his fans: ‘I’m still 
Tom.’

Stars were quick to 
congratulate him, with Kylie Minogue tweeting: ‘Inspiring and brave...as
 always!!!’ while Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas wrote: ‘Well done 
Tom Daley.’

Supportive: Tom posted this image with his mother Debbie on Sunday night with the caption 'So lucky to have such a supportive mum! I love you!'
