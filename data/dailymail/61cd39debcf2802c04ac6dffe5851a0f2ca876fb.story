After finding their dream home, Gary Humphris and his family were delighted when their £400,000 cash offer was accepted.

They moved into the four-bedroom property – complete with sauna, swimming pool and games room – straight away, and Mr Humphris set about spending the remaining £70,000 of their savings on renovations.

But after six months of bliss, the family were told they did not own the house after all – and that it was being repossessed.

Distraught: Gary and Samantha Humphris with their sons Kallum and Mason. They lost their home after solicitors handling its sale fled with their money

Two solicitors handling the sale have fled after failing to pass on the Humphrises’ money as required. One man has been jailed for two and a half years in connection with the scam, while another man and a woman have been released on bail.

The family are yet to recover any of their cash. Now penniless and homeless, Mr Humphris, 50, his wife Samantha, 36, and sons Kallum, 13, and Mason, ten, are staying with Mrs Humphris’s parents.

Their savings were ‘the result of 34 years of hard work’, Mr Humphris said. ‘It has been taken away from us just like that.’

Mr Humphris, who runs his own property maintenance and commercial cleaning business, and his wife sold their previous home in August 2010, giving them enough money to buy a new house mortgage-free.

They lived in a mobile home while 
searching for the perfect family property, which they eventually found 
last year in Sidcup, Kent.

‘It
was everything we could have dreamed of,’ Mr Humphris said. ‘It had 
four bedrooms, a swimming pool, an annexe in the garden with a sauna and
a games room for the kids, and it backed on to fields with horses. We 
never thought we would get it because it was on the market for offers 
around £500,000 and we only had £400,000.

‘But we had cash ready to buy it, and the estate agent came back and said: 'As long as you can complete within ten days, it’s yours.” We transferred the £400,000 for the house into our solicitors’ account, and on completion day they transferred the money into the account of the sellers’ solicitors.

‘That was in August last year. Where our money went from there, nobody knows.’Mr Humphris said the first sign that 
something was wrong came in September, when his solicitor had difficulty
registering the title deeds with the Land Registry. ‘Eventually it came
to light that the money we had paid had disappeared and the two 
partners of the solicitors’ firm had fled,’ Mr Humphris said.

Further investigations revealed that the couple selling the property owed £542,000 to mortgage firms, meaning the sale should never have been permitted. This had been concealed by the sellers’ solicitors.

‘Even when we found out what happened, we never thought we would have to give the house back,’ Mrs Humphris said.

‘We thought because we hadn’t done anything wrong there would be a way around it – but the more court hearings we attended, the more we realised that wasn’t going to happen.

‘I will never forget seeing the children sitting on the stairs crying while we were packing when the house was repossessed because they did not want to go.’

Mr and Mrs Humphris thought the £400,000 would be returned to them by the solicitors’ insurer – but a loophole meant it did not have to pay up if both of the firm’s partners were fraudulent.

‘Now our whole future is in the hands of the Solicitors Regulation Authority,’ Mr Humphris said.

The SRA has closed down the offending solicitors’ firm, which cannot be named due to a court order. It is still investigating the company, which is thought to have left dozens of other victims out of pocket.

A spokesman for the regulator said its compensation fund had received ‘a number of claims relating to the solicitors’, and asked for Mr Humphris’s ‘continued patience’.City of London Police are also investigating the firm.

Last month, Mdmustazur Rahman pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to two counts of fraud by misrepresentation in relation to setting up a bank account in the name of the solicitors. The 28-year-old, from West Ham, East London, also pleaded guilty to money laundering.

He was jailed for two and a half years and warned he could be deported to Pakistan. In addition, a man and a woman aged 32 and 30, both from Hackney, East London, have been released on bail.
