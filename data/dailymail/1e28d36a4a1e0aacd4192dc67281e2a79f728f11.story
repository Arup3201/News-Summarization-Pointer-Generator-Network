I’m really excited about the England squad Stuart Lancaster has selected and delighted to see Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter involved again.

This is a momentous year for English rugby with a World Cup just around the corner and I’m pleased Lancaster has been bold enough to select two of the Premiership’s form players in a squad full of high-quality Test match animals.

England may be missing a few players through injury but they have so much depth that there are no excuses for underperforming in this Six Nations. It’s time to deliver. 

Danny Cipriani was given a surprise call up to England's training squad ahead of the Six Nations

England head coach Stuart Lancaster named his training squad at Twickenham on Wednesday

They have more talent available than any of the other home unions and I can’t wait to see a bold, attacking England team with a clear direction of how they want to play and a clear selection policy based on attack-minded players who want to take the game to the opposition.

Cipriani definitely falls into that category and I’m delighted to see him included. I have watched so many high-class fly-halves down the years, with Jonny Wilkinson unquestionably being the best to have played for England.

But Cipriani is the only English No 10 of the past 20 years who, if I’d been coach and he had been up for selection at the same time as Jonny, could have caused big selection headaches. 

Nick Easter was also recalled to the England set-up despite being in international exile since 2011

The Sale man’s skill-set is so complete. He poses an attacking threat with ball in hand and has a superb kicking game and world-class distribution. 

I think Wilkinson would have got the nod over him in the end but the fact I even mention them in the same breath shows how highly I rate Cipriani.

If England are to capitalise on their world-class pack they have to pick a fly-half who will instil fear in the opposition. George Ford has enormous potential, a great attitude and all the skills required to take the ball flat to the line and challenge opponents on the gainline.

Jonny Wilkinson is widely regarded as the best fly-half to ever play for England

But if there’s one English fly-half opposition teams would not want to play against at the moment then it’s Cipriani. He’s also got the edge in experience.

For me, he’s simply the best fly-half in the country right now and he’d be in my XV for the opener against Wales on February 6. 

It’s interesting that Lancaster has gone for four fly-halves instead of three and I wonder if there was some last-minute tinkering. 

But the real test will be when he picks his 23 for Cardiff in what is going to be one of the biggest Six Nations games in living memory.

There’s so much riding on that contest, not just for the Six Nations but also with the World Cup pool game coming up in September. 

It cannot be overstated how important it is for England to win next month because if they lose, they will be behind the eight ball for the rest of the championship.

That’s why I want to see them pick a side to really attack Wales. England need to play flat to the line and challenge the Welsh defence. 

The exciting aspect is that there are so many players in form at the moment with Northampton, Bath, Wasps and Saracens all flying in Europe.

How will England choose to play? Bath proved in their fantastic win over Toulouse at the weekend that there are English-qualified players who are capable of shredding defences with their pace and skills — Jonathan Joseph was absolutely outstanding at outside centre.

I’d pick Joseph against Wales alongside his Bath team-mate Kyle Eastmond. I’d then insist on the Millennium Stadium roof being shut to ensure perfect conditions. Then I’d order my team to go out and attack.

It’s going to be fascinating to see if Lancaster can hold his nerve when it comes to whittling down his squad and I’ll be disappointed if he reverts to a conservative selection policy.

This is not the year for ‘Steady Eddie’ selection — this is the year to risk everything in the quest for gold. I’d even add wing Christian Wade and scrum-half Joe Simpson to my squad and team. This is his time for Lancaster to show the country he is capable of coaching a team to the ultimate glory. I’ve no doubt he’ll be energised and excited about that prospect and the critical thing now is that he remains bold and clear in his selection.

He needs to pick a tough , uncompromising team capable of scaring opponents and with Lions such as Alex Corbisiero back in the fold there’s no doubt he has a pack that will pose problems for anyone.

Easter’s return is welcome. It’s a huge achievement for a player of 36 to force his way back into contention after a three-and-a-half-year absence. He looks fit and in good shape and while he may not be the quickest No 8 in the country, he does possess excellent footballing skills and bags of experience.

It’s testament to Easter’s mental strength that he’s never given up on playing for England again. I hope all that nonsense about what he may or may not have said after the World Cup quarter-final defeat in 2011 has been well and truly put to bed.

I’d still have gone for Steffon Armitage — who is proving time after time at Toulon that he is a world-class operator — but Easter is a bold selection and the next best thing.

So, all in all, I’m encouraged by this squad. This year is rugby’s equivalent of the 2012 Olympics. It’s rugby’s year. And the challenge for Lancaster and his coaching team is to pick a team of which the nation can be proud and which opponents will fear. The talent is there, no question.

This squad is a great start. The next two weeks are going to be crucial ahead of what is a massive, massive game. The question is: Will they hold their nerve?
