There was still no sign of a college student who was last seen riding her bike home from a friend's house five days ago as the FBI stepped up the search and friends scoured the area.

Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, who attends the University of Louisiana in Lafayette, disappeared on her way home at 2am on Saturday. 

The FBI and Lousiana State Police intensified the search as  friends and family held a candle-light vigil for the missing woman last night - her 22nd birthday.

Desperate search: Michaela Shunick has been missing since Saturday after being last seen cycling home at 2am in Lafayette, Louisiana

Mystery: Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, a 22-year-old anthropology major at the University of Louisiana, was last seen leaving a friend's house

A reward of $20,000 has been offered for information of her whereabouts while family and friends handed out hundreds of fliers and stapled posters to lampposts.

Dozens of volunteers have combed the four-mile route that Miss Shunick would have taken on Saturday night. 

A larger search area was covered by police officers with dogs but has so far been fruitless.

Miss Shunick's sister Charlene told ABC: 'I think she's OK, I think she's alive. I think she's out there.'

Her mother Nancy Rowe added: 'We want our daughter back - that will make everything better.'

Support: The community in Lafayette attend a vigil to pray for the missing student

She added that her daughter's cellphone has been switched off since Saturday morning.

The student was described as an avid cyclist by her parents but they said that she had never disappeared for days in the past. The senior anthropology major missed her brother’s high school graduation on Saturday.

She would have not cycled through any areas which she thought were unsafe and always carried a can of Mace.

The family said they cannot think of any reason that anyone would want to harm the girl while friends added that she did not have a boyfriend and appeared to be in no trouble.

Miss Shunick is a white female with blonde hair, 5’1” tall and 115 pounds. She was last seen wearing a pastel, multi-colored striped shirt, light-wash skinny jeans and grey shoes. She has a small tattoo of a bicycle on her ankle.

She was riding her black Schwinn bicycle with gold handle bar grips and wearing a brown leather backpack.

A private donor has offered $10,000 for information leading to Shunick’s return, while the Lafayette Police Department has established a ‘Tips Line’ for people to call.

A Facebook page, titled Find Mickey Shunick Now, has been started and was 'liked' by more than 8,000 people.

A vigil was held in downtown Lafayette last night.  At the gathering, the silence was broken by chants of 'Bring Mickey home!' from the crowd.

Police said that they continued to treat the case as a missing person but were not ruling out foul play. They still had no solid leads as to what happened to the student.
