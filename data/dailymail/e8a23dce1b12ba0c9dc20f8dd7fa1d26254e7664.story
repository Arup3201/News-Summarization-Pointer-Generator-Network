In a ground-breaking custody battle, non-biological mothers in same-sex relationships have the same parental rights as biological mothers, the Kansas Supreme court has ruled.

Non-biological mother, Marci Frazier, was granted joint custody and 'reasonable parenting time' after her former partner moved their daughters to another state, denying that Frazier was entitled to the same parenting rights as her.

The ruling is not only a landmark for 
same-sex parents, but for any non-biological parents who want to maintain access to children they have been raising.

Frazier's former partner Kelly Goudschaal conceived two daughters as a result of artificial insemination, meaning that Frazier was the non-biological mother.

When Goudschall moved out of their
family home in 2008, she moved the two girls, now aged 10 and 8,
to Texas and limited Frazier's visits.

In a bid to maintain contact with her non-biological daughters Frazier filed a legal action to enforce a
co-parenting agreement the two women had signed promising 'jointly and equally share parental 
responsibility'.

Goudschaal argued not to maintain the agreement, saying that she was the only one with the legal status of parent and appealing 
Frazier's right to joint custody.

Goudschall's argument was that the courts did not 
have authority to address custody issues unless they were presented 'in a divorce action involving two 
married persons, who would necessarily have to be a man and a woman' in Kansas.

However, the court agreed with Frazier that the children's best interests outweighed the need to 'strictly adhere to the biological connection', allowing her joint custody.

The court said not enforcing the parenting agreement would deny the children the opportunity to have two parents.

Cathy Sakimura, Family Law Director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said: 'The Kansas Supreme Court recognised that children with same-sex parents have the same need for stability as children in any other family,'

With this ruling, Kansas joins a number of other states in deciding that when two people raise a child together, the law should treat them both as the childâ€™s parents.
