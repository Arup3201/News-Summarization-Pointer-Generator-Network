An aid worker searching for survivors of an earthquake in Turkey was among at least ten killed by a second tremor.

Rescue efforts began in the eastern city of Van on Wednesday night after a magnitude-5.7 quake struck the region. Around  28 survivors have been pulled out of the rubble. 

Aid workers and journalists had been staying at two hotels in the city since the earlier quake, but the second tremor caused the buildings to collapse. It is thought the structures could have been weakened by the magnitude-7.2 quake that killed 600 on October 23.

Atsushi Miyazaki, of Japan's 
Association for Aid and Relief, died in hospital after he was dug out 
yesterday morning from the rubble of the five-storey Bayram Hotel. It 
was reported he had rushed to Turkey to help victims of last quake.

Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said the quake toppled 25 buildings in Van, but only 
three of them were occupied since the others have been evacuated after 
suffering damages in last month's powerful earthquake.

Voices could be heard calling for 
help from under the debris, and at least 23 people were pulled alive 
from the rubble in early rescue efforts, according to Turkish media.

Rescue workers sped up their search for survivors by daylight on Thursday, trying to open tunnels into the debris, CNN-Turk television reported.

The workers used the glare of high-powered lights to work throughout the night despite several aftershocks.

State-run TRT television said at least seven bodies were recovered and, citing a hotel worker, reported that 35 to 40 people were believed to be trapped in the rubble of the Bayram Hotel.

Other reports suggested that as many as 100 people were feared buried in the aftermath of the Turkish quake.

Hotel owner Aslan Bayram told NTV television that the hotel had 27 guests, about half of whom were inside when the quake hit.

Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay 
said the quake toppled a hotel, a school and a number of mudbrick homes.
He said rescue teams are being sent to the region from the capital, 
Ankara, and other areas.

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was in Van to visit survivors of the previous quake on the last day of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice.

He said 15 people were rescued alive and transported to hospitals by air ambulance.

Hurriyet newspaper said the quake 
brought down two hotels and 16 other buildings, most of them structures 
that had been damaged in the earlier, 7.2-magnitude quake in the 
province of Van.

Workers have been clearing debris from that disaster for more than a week.

One of the buildings that collapsed was the Bayram Hotel, Van's best-known hotel. It was at least 40 years old, and had been renovated last year.

Reports said the collapsed hotel was one of many being used by journalists and aid workers involved in recovery 
efforts following the earlier quake.

Ozgur Gunes, a journalist with Cihan news agency, was staying at the hotel but had just left the building when the earthquake struck on Wednesday night. He said there were journalists working in the lobby at the time.

'There were some small cracks, but we were told that there was no structural damage,' he told Sky Turk television.

The Turkish Red Crescent immediately dispatched 15,000 tents and some 300 rescue workers.

There was no damage in the town of Edremit, the quake's epicenter.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured 5.7. Turkey's Kandilli seismology center said it struck at 9.23pm local time (7.23pm GMT).

About 1,400 aftershocks have rocked the region since the massive earthquake on October 23, which killed 600 and left thousands homeless.

Many residents had been living in 
tents, despite the cold, too afraid to return to their homes. At least 
2,000 buildings were destroyed in the stronger temblor and authorities 
declared another 3,700 buildings unfit for living.
