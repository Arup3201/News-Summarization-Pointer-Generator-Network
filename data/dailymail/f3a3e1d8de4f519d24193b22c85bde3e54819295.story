A love-struck former rugby star and his model bride-to-be have become a YouTube hit with a video he created of his surprise proposal on an Italian island.

Garth Chamberlain, originally from Zimbabwe but now living in London, spent weeks secretly planning how he would pop the question to his girlfriend of three years, Swedish-born Tess Montgomery.

With the help of Tess' modelling agency, MOT Models, he faked a booking for her to do a modelling job at a luxury hotel on the island of Favigana near Sicily. He had secretly flown the 1,000 miles to the same location to surprise her and set up secret cameras to film the whole thing.

Romantic: Garth popped the question to Tess on an Italian island after planning an elaborate proposal

Plan in action: Garth had arranged for Tess to visit the Cas'almare Hotel in Favigana on what she thought was a modelling job. She's seen here arriving for the 'shoot'

Meanwhile... Garth had arrived earlier and, with the help of staff, set up the terrace for a romantic meal with a stunning view (and put cameras in place to capture it all)

Surprise! When Tess arrives on the terrace, Garth hides while she's given an iPad with a video he filmed earlier of why she's really there

When Tess, 30, arrived she was handed an iPad by the hotel staff on which Garth, 28, who used to play for London Wasps, had recorded her a video message.

The footage included shots of where they first met in Wandsworth, London, and dozens of romantic photos of the couple together on their 
adventures around the world.

It also revealed how Garth, who now works as a project manager for construction company ISG, had travelled all the way to Sweden for a day to formally ask Tess's father, Holger, for this daughter's hand in marriage.

Traditional: The video also revealed how Garth had travelled all the way to Sweden (without Tess knowing) to ask her father's permission for her hand in marriage

After Tess had watched the video, Garth then surprised her by stepping out on the terrace and going down on one knee. Tess is seen sobbing with delight as she gladly accepts his proposal.

Tess wrote on her blog afterwards how it was all a wonderful surprise.

She said: 'I can say that it was quite a shock 
to be booked on a job and end up in the middle of a marriage proposal 
instead. Garth had been planning this since sometime in March and 
received help from my good bookers at MOT, so I really could not 
imagine.

'I have no idea how they managed to keep everything secret so 
long. That he could go to Sweden and back without me even noticing?'

She added: 'I was stunned - Garth made the most romantic proposal in the world and I am one very lucky lady.'

She said yes! The couple then celebrate as the sun sets

Garth told the MailOnline that all the hard planning and travelling to make the proposal perfect was worth it.

He said: 'I wanted to take Tess away to propose in a romantic location, one of the classics, but since we hadn't been on a holiday in a while I knew she would be suspicious.

'I wanted to ask her Dad, Holger's, permission and didn't quite know how to do that, after many failed plans and attempts, it culminated in me booking a next day flight over to Stockholm, a half hour stopover and then a reverse journey back to London to avoid suspicions of me being out of the country. I'm glad I did that, I know it means a lot to Holger and apart for a crazy journey, totally worth it.

'Then I came up with the idea of booking her on a 'fake' job, with a lot of help from her entire agency at MOT Models, we came up with the perfect disguise, we managed to get her over to Italy after a little stopover flight, so I could get there before her and set everything up.

'Elena and Sonia at Cas'almare (the hotel) helped with everything that side and before I had time to breathe she was arriving and I spent the time in the hotel's basement hiding away in preparation for Tess to come down to meet the crew for her shoot... then she got the iPad...'

Delighted: Tess couldn't wait to call her friends and family and tell them the good news

Tying the knot: The couple will wed in December in Zimbabwe

Ruse: Tess's agency MOT Models helped Garth plan the surprise

Tess said she and her friends and family were 'choked' by the lengths Garth went to in order to pop the question.

She added: 'My family is of course 
over the moon, I have four younger sisters who love it - their 
boyfriends, maybe not so much!'

As Tess knows Garth loves to film and take pictures - mostly so they can share what they are up to with friends and family around the world - she was not surprised when she discovered he had recorded their proposal.

'I'm so glad he filmed everything, because
 now we have something to revisit when we want and that we can show our 
children in the future,' she said.

The original plan had been to only show the video to their friends and family and play it at their wedding, which will take place on New Year's Eve in Zimbabwe.

But they then decided to share it on YouTube - where it was already received more than 13,000 hits - and Tess said they have been 'overwhelmed' by the response from well-wishers. Â
