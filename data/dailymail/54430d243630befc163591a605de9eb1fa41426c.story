An Israeli cricket umpire has died after being hit by a ball during a league match in the city of Ashdod, the Israel Cricket Association has announced.

Former national team captain Hillel Oscar was officiating in the game between Young Ashdod and Super Lions Lod when he was struck below the jaw by a ball hit by a batsman.

The incident comes just two days after the death of Australia Test player Phillip Hughes, who also suffered fatal injuries after being hit by a bouncer bowled during a Sheffield Shield match.
