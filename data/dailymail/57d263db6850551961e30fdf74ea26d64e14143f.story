A community in Long Island have reacted furiously to a reverend's proposal to house illegal immigrant children in his church.

Residents living near the Holy Cross Lutheran Church, in Commack, piled into the building in protest last week - with some claiming their own children would be put at risk by the move.

The church wants to house 40 homeless children aged four to 17 - who have  illegally crossed the United States' border with Mexico - and their reverend, Dennis Walker, is urging people to do the 'Christian thing'.

Thousands of children illegally enter the USA from Mexico each year - often in an attempt to reunite with lost family members. 

The unpopular proposal to house some of them in the church was initiated by the Lutheran Social Services of New York,  Newsday reports.

The Manhattan-based agency said they would cover costs for the renovation of the building, using federal funds.

Reverend Dennis Walker also claims the church is in dire financial straits and says the immigrant children program could bring in $8,000 - $10,000 a month.

He claims the plan would create jobs, help pay off a $25,000 debt - and allow the church to do the Christian thing.

Mr Walker also says that community opposition was being fueled by misinformation and that he hopes 'people will reconsider in a more rational light, insisting the project would have 'minimal impact on the community with substantial benefits'.

But residents living nearby are firmly against the idea, with one mother, Sheryl Cambria, 35, calling it 'scary'.

The special-education teacher at Lindenhurst High School said: 'I have two little kids. Who's to say my house is going to be safe?'

Another resident, New York City firefighter Michael Cantwell, 44, added: 'It's basically going to be a hotel right next to my house.'

The church had to cancel a meeting last week as a result of the angry protest, but Mr Walker said the idea is still being considered and a decision is yet to be made.

The children living in the church would be subject to hearings before federal immigration authorities and could ultimately be deported. 

The church would be guaranteed a minimal three-year pact to house children.

Kenneth J. Wolfe, a spokesman for the federal Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the immigrant children program, was unable to confirm whether the Lutheran church was going ahead with the plan. 

Nationally, the organisation projects it will have to find beds for as many as 60,000 children in the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. 

The figure is more than double that of the previous year - where around 25,000 were placed.
