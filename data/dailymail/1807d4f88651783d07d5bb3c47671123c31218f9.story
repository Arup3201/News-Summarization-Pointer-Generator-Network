More than twice as many voters trust the Tories with the economy than Labour, a new poll has revealed.

Over the past six months the proportion who think David Cameron’s party has the best policies for the economy has soared from 35 to 45 per cent, the pollsters Ipsos Mori found. This is 25 per cent more than those who believe Ed Miliband’s Labour is best on the economy.

But Mr Cameron has lost the Conservative lead on European and immigration policies - with UKIP now seen as the best party to deal with these issues. 

At the same time. the proportion of voters citing immigration as the most important issue has doubled to 30 per cent since 2010.

The Tories have a clear lead on the most important issue for voters - the economy. But it is behind on immigration and the NHS

The economy remains the most important issue for voters, ahead of immigration, healthcare and education

The same poll revealed that the economy was seen as the more important issue for the public when making up their mind who to vote for.

Managing the economy is seen as the most important issue by 31 per cent of the public. This is just ahead of immigration and healthcare.

Immigration has jumped from fourth to second place in the table of most-important issues – with health and education down to third and fourth places respectively.

Welfare is the fifth most important issue, overtaking tax, crime and unemployment.

While the Tories are seen as the best party on the economy, they are narrowly behind UKIP on immigration – and way behind Labour on health.

The proportion of voters who say UKIP has the best policies on immigration has almost doubled over the past year.

In September 11 per cent said Nigel Farage’s party had the best policies on immigration – but this has surged to 20 per cent.

The Conservatives are seen by just 19 per cent as having the best policies – down three percent. Labour is backed by 18 per cent on the issue.

Ed Miliband is backed by voters on health, education and benefits - but Mr Cameron is way ahead on the economy

UKIP are also ahead on European policies – with just under a quarter support Mr Farage’s stance. Just one in five Back Mr Cameron on the EU meanwhile.

Labour is ahead on three of the top five issues, health, education and benefits.

Gideon Skinner, of Ipsos MORI, said: ‘We’re in the extraordinary situation of having three issues tied at the top as most important to the public, and a different party making the running on each — the Conservatives on the economy, UKIP on immigration, and Labour on healthcare.

‘So all the parties have their signal issue, but it means going into party conferences season there is still all to play for.’

The same pollsters last week found the Tories had retaken the lead in the polls ahead of Labour, just eight months before the general election in May.

The Conservatives were backed by 34 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote in next year's general election against 33 per cent for Labour. UKIP meanwhile is on 15 per cent and Liberal Democrats just 7 per cent.

David Cameron's Tories have inched ahead of Labour just eight months before the next general election

It means the Tories are ahead of Labour for the first time since December 2011 in the Ipsos MORI surveys.

Nigel Farage's bid to shake off the ‘wasted vote’ tag received a boost, as the number agreeing that backing Ukip at a general election amounted to throwing away your vote has declined from 57 per cent to 50 per cent since May.

Over half - 53 per cent - of those questioned said the eurosceptic party was raising important issues that other parties were not taking seriously enough, and 14 per cent said they would like their local MP to defect to Ukip.
