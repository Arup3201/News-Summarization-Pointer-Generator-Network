A four-year-old boy has been expelled from school on his first day after his mother took to Facebook to complain about staff.

After dropping off her son, Will, at Sonshine Christian Academy, in Callahan, Florida, Ashley Habat wrote a status on Facebook, questioning whether the school's staff were 'ignorant'.

Ms Habat claims that the school decided to expel her son because of the post.

Ashley Habat says her son was expelled because of a status she wrote about his school's staff on Facebook

The post, which Ms Habat (Ashley Raine on Facebook) thought was private, was seen by school staff

When Ms Habat dropped her son at his new school, she told a member of staff that she had not been given enough notice of picture day, WPTV reported.

After being told all parents had been informed the week before, Ms Habat went home and posted her frustrations on Facebook. 

Thinking the post was private, and that the school would not see it, she said: 'Why is it that every single day there is something new I dislike about [my son's] school? 

'Are my standards really too high or are people working in the education field really just that ignorant?'

But because she tagged the school in the post, staff were able to see what she had written despite her profile being private.

The next morning Ms Habat was called by the school, asking her to stop by when she dropped off her son.

'They just felt like we weren't the right fit of parent relationship with the school and that they didn't want him as a student anymore. He had done nothing wrong,' she said. 

'I was in shock. Why would you expel a four-year-old over something his mom posts on her private Facebook page.' 

Ms Habat explained why she had taken to Facebook to vent her anger.

Sonshine Christian Academy said Ms Habat's post questioned the staff's 'integrity and intelligence'

She said: 'The administrator of the preschool checking him in, she's like, "Well it's picture day, are you excited?" and he just went on to class. 

'But I had mentioned that they didn't give enough notice. And she's like, "Well we put it in his folder last week,"'

The four-year-old's mother has since received a letter of dismissal saying that she broke the academy's social media policy.

It says: 'Your relationship with Sonshine did not get off to a very good start the first day of school.

'You utilized social media to call into question not only the integrity but the intelligence of our staff.

'These actions are also consistent with sowing discord which is spoken of in the handbook you signed.'
