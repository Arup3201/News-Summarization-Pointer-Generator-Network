A doctor was killed and a television news station knocked off air when the  plane he was flying crashed into a television transmitter on its way in to land.

Dr Kenneth Rice was flying towards Preston Smith International Airport in Lubbock, Texas, when his light aircraft struck KCBD NewsChannel 11's transmitter, knocking it to the ground.

The single-engine Piper PA-46 hit the ground north of the broadcaster's studios, KCBD reported.

Smash: The remains of the single-engine aircraft piloted by Dr Kenneth Rice which crashed into a television station transmitter tower as it approached the Preston Smith International Airport in Lubbock, Texas

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Dr Rice's plane crashed shortly after dropping off radar screens at about 7.30pm local time.

'The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed a crash site inside the city limits of Lubbock,' the FAA said. 'FAA investigators are on their way to the site. 

'The National Transportation Safety Board has been notified.'

Dr Rice, a diabetes expert who worked at University Medical Center in Lubbock, is  a co-owner of Daedalus Air, the company which owned the plane

Alex DeLeon was in the KCBD parking lot when the tower went down. He told the broadcaster: 'The antenna or tower just collapsed into two... I saw it falling this direction, so I got under this awning here, and I just felt like it was over me.'

Firefighters told workers at KCBD to leave the building, warning them the remaining transmitter tower was also at risk of collapsing.

Steve Holland of the Lubbock Fire Department told the Daily Toreador that the tail section of Dr Rice's aircraft was almost totally destroyed in the crash.

'The wings are — and I haven’t spent a lot of time over there looking — but I believe one of the wings for sure was detached from the airplane,' Mr Holland added.

Dr Rice, a diabetes expert who worked out of University Medical Center in Lubbock, is listed as a co-owner of Daedalus Air, the company which owned the plane.

According to the FAA the flight originated from Carlsbad, New Mexico.

The crash left lights knocked out across south-east Lubbock after the aircraft struck an electricity transmission line as it went down.

About 2,500 homes were left without power while emergency crews from the Lubbock Power & Light company tried to restore the connection, according to a statement by the firm published on everythinglubbock.com.

Power was restored by about midnight.
