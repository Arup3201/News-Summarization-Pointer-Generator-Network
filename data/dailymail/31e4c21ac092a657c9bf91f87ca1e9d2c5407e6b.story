A mother given just two years to live set off on a farewell tour of the world with her three children - and ten years on she’s still loving life.

Joanne Teague, then 39, kept it a secret from her children aged three to eight when doctors warned a heart defect meant her days were numbered.

So she planned a series of tours with her husband and children to make the most of her 'mummy memories' with her young family.

Mrs Teague, 50, has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which means her organs and blood vessels are at risk of tearing. She is pictured recently with her husband, Danny, and children - Will, 18, Alice, 14, and Peter, 13

Mrs Teague found a 'lust for life' as she toured Spain, Greece, Switzerland, France and Italy during a six-month trip.

And she has surprised doctors by still leading a healthy life a decade later - and seeing herchildren Will, 18, Alice, 14 and Peter, 13, grow up.

Mrs Teague took the trip to make some 'loving family memories' for her young children but didn’t tell them about the doctor’s warning.

She said: 'I could have just given up and waited for the end. But I planned the trip - and it gave me a lust for life.

'It may have given me the passion to carry on living or maybe I’m just lucky.

'But whatever the reason, I’m so glad that I’ve seen my children grow up - and had some fantastic times together.'

Mrs Teague (pictured with her husband Danny and children Will, Alice and Pete) was diagnosed after she had a heart attack at the age of just 39. The life expectancy for someone with EDS is only in the 40s

Mrs Teague and her husband took their children out of school and went travelling around Europe for six months to ensure they had lots of happy memories with their mother

Her congenital condition causes 'spontaneous ruptures of the tissue in her heart' meaning she’s at constant risk of a dangerous heart attack.

It was discovered when Mrs Teague was rushed to hospital in after suffering a major heart attack aged just 39.

She immediately underwent open heart surgery and a heart by-pass before she was diagnosed with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome eighteen months later.

When they went on the trip, the children were aged between three and eight. They are now 18, 14 and 13 and Mrs Teague is still living a healthy and active life

Mrs Teague said: 'I could have just given up and waited for the end. But I planned the trip - and it gave me a lust for life. It may have given me the passion to carry on living or maybe I'm just lucky. But whatever the reason, I'm so glad that I've seen my children grow up'

The incurable condition leaves sufferers with an average life expectancy in the 40s.

She told her husband Danny, now 44, but the couple kept the sad news from their three young children.

Mrs Teague planned a six month trip around Europe and then was planning to go even further around the globe.

Mrs Teague, now 50, said: 'I was so frightened. It’s not something you ever want to hear as a person - never mind a mum of three little ones.

'The thought of one day not being around was too much to bear. I decided to make time and build some special family memories.

'So we took them away to go sightseeing in Rome, to take in the fresh air of the Swiss Alps and to play and explore at Disneyland Paris .

'We piled our family of five into a people carrier and spent every minute together.

'It was trying at times but ultimately we had a fantastic trip exploring the big wide world together. I wouldn’t of had it any other way.'

She said it helped educate her children - hands on geography, language and history lessons as they visited the Eiffel Tower, the Sistine Chapel and the Colosseum.

After six months away, the couple decided to return home for the children to concentrate on their schooling.

Mrs Teague, of Llantwit Major, near Cardiff, has defied the odds.

She continues to live an active life, she has even returned to work part time as an occupational therapist.

The threat of a repeat attack hangs over the busy mother - but she is determined not to let it blight her life.

Her brother Mark, 56, died in October last year from the same congenital condition.

Mrs Teague knows how important it is to live each day to the full - and is bringing out a book by Candy Jar Books called 'See You in September' about her experience.

She said: 'Having this condition changes the way you approach things. You don’t get het up about the little things.

'I don’t put things off but otherwise I try and keep my family life as normal as possible. Every day is a little extra for us.'

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body causing them to be weak.

Typical features are stretchy skin, loose joints and fragile body tissues.

Collagen is a building block that strengthens and supports various body tissues - it is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels and the spine.

EDS is caused by alterations in certain genes - these can be passed from parents to their children but it is recessive so both parents have to be carriers for it to be passed on.

The condition affects at least one person in every 5,000 in the UK.

There are various different forms of EDS. All share some common features, such as loose joints, abnormal skin and fragile body tissues, but each form of EDS has unique characteristics too.

The most severe form is Vascular EDS which causes the organs and blood vessels to be at risk of rupturing - this can be fatal.

The life expectancy for people with Vascular EDS is in the 40s.
