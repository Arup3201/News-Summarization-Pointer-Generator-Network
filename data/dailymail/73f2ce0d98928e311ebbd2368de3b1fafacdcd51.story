Sam Baker was told by doctors that once the life-support tube was removed from her baby’s mouth, he would probably carry on breathing for a minute, an hour or maybe even a day.

Surrounded by family in the hospice the 20-year-old mother cradled one-month-old meningitis victim Harrison and prayed for a miracle as the ventilator was switched off.

She said: ‘I just sat in the chair holding him and I kept stroking his face and telling him how much I loved him as my tears rolled down on to his little chest. It was heart breaking.

Harrison Ellmer (pictured with his parents Samantha Baker and Adam Ellmer) contracted meningitis when he was just three-weeks-old. Doctors thought he could not be saved so he was taken to a hospice

Harrison's life support machine was turned off but he continued to breathe and was soon well enough to return home. He has been left deaf in one ear and with mild cerebral palsy

‘We all sat in silence, crying, urging him to keep breathing.’

Harrison began ‘coughing and choking’ as the tube was removed.

As minutes past, doctors warned Miss Baker and the child’s father Adam Ellmer against raising their expectations. 

Miss Baker explained: ‘I could see he was getting stronger but we didn’t want to get our hopes up.

‘The doctors had told us that even if
 Harrison did live he would probably be so badly brain damaged he would 
just lie there unable to function.

‘But as each hour went on he seemed 
to brighten and respond more and so I started to breast feed him and he 
accepted it. From then on he got better and he’s just our perfect little
 boy now.’

Harrison was born healthy but became ill a few weeks later and had to be taken by ambulance to Rotherham Hospital where he was resuscitated

Fearing that he would die, Harrison's parents had him christened while he was in hospital

Hope continued to grow until, against all the odds, Harrison was eventually returned to hospital and discharged ten days later.

Speaking from her home in North 
Anston, South Yorkshire, Miss Baker said: ‘What happened was every mum’s
 nightmare – to be told you are taking your little boy somewhere to die.

‘We were told there was nothing more that could be done for Harrison and he would have to be taken off his life-support machine.

‘They told us it might be nicer to take him to the children’s hospice because it was a better place to say goodbye to him. 

‘I couldn’t get my head round the fact that I was taking my lovely little boy somewhere to die.

‘Even when the doctors had given up 
hope I had something inside me that said it wasn’t Harrison’s time and 
he would live and he proved me right and pulled through.’

After Harrison had been in hospital for six days doctors told his parents that there was nothing more they could do for him and he was transferred to the Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice

Harrison's mother, Samantha Baker, said that when she took him home from the hospital it was the happiest moment of her life and that it was likely taking him home for the first time all over again

Ms Baker said that she now sees her son as a 'little miracle'. Harrison is pictured in hospital with his parents and grandmother

Harrison has been left deaf in one 
ear and with mild cerebral palsy that slightly restricts his movement on
 one side, but is otherwise healthy and Miss Baker describes him as ‘my 
perfect little boy’.

Harrison was born in January and was 
‘pumped full of antibiotics’ when tests confirmed that he was suffering 
from type B meningitis  –the most common form of the brain virus – and 
septicaemia.

As his condition deteriorated he was
 transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital before he was taken to 
Bluebell Wood Hospice – suffering from fits and unable to breathe alone.

Miss Baker said: ‘We count every day 
as a blessing. Harrison is just a happy smiling, cheerful baby who never
 cries. He’s babbling and rolling over and developing normally.’ 

His father Adam, a pipe fitter, said:
 ‘It’s been a really difficult time and Sam has been fantastic. It was 
great to bring Harrison home again, he is such a lovely happy little 
lad.’

Harrison's parents have now raised more than £5,000 for the Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice

Bluebell Wood fundraiser Gail Parkin said: 'It's wonderful to see Harrison looking so well after everything he went through. He's certainly a tough little cookie'
