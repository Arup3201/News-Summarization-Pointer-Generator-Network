They were the first astronauts to circumnavigate the moon in the international race to explore the lunar landscape.

William 'Bill' Anders and James 'Jim' Lovell made history on their Apollo 8 flight in 1968, and in doing so named craters and features along their orbital path after crew members and relatives.

But 40 years after their incredible feat, they have discovered that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has selected different craters to mark their flight.

And these craters are on the far - dark - side of the moon, which is not visible from Earth.

The IAU chose these craters in 1970, according to the Independent, but the apparent snub has just come to light after the agency advertised it was using public campaigns to name celestial bodies including the moon's landmarks.

Appalled at their mission's apparent unimportance, Mr Anders wrote to the journal the New Scientist, saying: 'I thought these names would have some priority, but when the IAU honoured our crew with crater names, it picked three craters that were not only well out of sight of our orbital track, but also in darkness at the time of our mission.'

The letter, seen by the Independent, goes on to say that he wrote to the IAU to try to correct crater-naming discrepancies. But he says he was 'brushed off by its bureaucracy'.

Making history: William Anders, pictured right in 1968, made history when he and James Lovell, left, orbited the moon for the first time and named some its key features

On their Apollo 8 mission they got the first glimpse of the Earth from the far side of the moon

He also provided the IAU with a map of the Apollo 8 flight path, to show how the craters and landmarks along its orbit were chosen, and he says the agency kept his map and never got it back.

One of the named landscapes was a small mountain on the shore of the Sea of Tranquility, which had no name.

'I observed it on Apollo 8 and called it Mount Marilyn, after my wife. It was used as the starting points for the descents of Apollo 10 and 11,' he said in his letter.

He wrote that although the IAU does not officially recognise the name, 'it is embedded in space-flight history'.

Some of the key features of the moon that are visible form Earth - none of which are names chosen by astronauts Anders and Lovell

The IAU has said the issue is now in the hands of the agency's general secretary.

Apollo 8 was the first manned circumlunar flight of the moon, and it carried out 10 orbits in 20 hours.

It was also the first manned flight of the Saturn V rocket.

The crew were the first people to see the far side of the Moon and to get a glimpse of Earth over the lunar horizon with their own eyes.

Live television pictures were broadcast to Earth.

Founded in 1919, when the idea of space exploration began to look like it could one day be a reality, the Paris-based IAU has long-held the role of naming celestial features.

Its announcement this summer that it would open the naming process up to members of the public marks a shift to try democratise the process, but strict rules still apply.
