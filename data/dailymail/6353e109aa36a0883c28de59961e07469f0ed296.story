Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has finally confessed she has had a facelift, saying: 'I like the way I look and like to keep it that way'.

The outspoken chick-lit novelist made the admission speaking on BBC2’s Newsnight from New 
York, after nearly three years of repeated speculation about her appearance.

Mrs Mensch, 41, had previously refused to say that she had cosmetic surgery while she was working at Westminster, but told Jeremy Paxman last night: 'I had a little tightening in my face' for 'maintenance'.

Jeremy Paxman asked her: 'You are a highly successful, highly intelligent woman who achieved power and yet you choose to do this to you body. Aren't you worried about what example you set?'.

Responding to the compliments by saying 'carry on', Mrs Mensch then denied she was a bad role model adding: 'The desire to look good is not entirely negative'.

The author had refused to answer the 
question when a journalist spotted her facial scarring in 2011 because she felt it was ‘trivialising women politicians based
 on their appearance’.

But now she is no longer a politician, she said she felt she could talk about the procedure, which she claims she did ‘just for maintenance’, because she likes the way she looks and was ‘very happy’ with the result.

Plastic surgery addict Alicia Douvall was also on the programme, who admitted having 500 procedures and going into rehab as a result.

She said her obsession had left her physically and mentally scarred.

In 2011, Mrs Mensch, now 41, was asked 
if she had had a facelift. A reporter later wrote of seeing ‘incisions 
in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet that look so fresh, they 
still have tiny lines of scab’.

The writer thought it may be evidence of a ‘Chicago facelift’, a procedure that is known for its short recovery time.

At the time, Mrs Mensch responded: ‘My God. Um. . . OK. .. I’ve always wondered what I would say the first time somebody asked me this question. And without denying it, I’m going to refuse to answer.’

But last night she told Jeremy Paxman: ‘I refused to answer that question, not because I was embarrassed about the procedure but because people are always trying to trivialise women politicians based on their appearance.

‘But as I am no longer a politician ... I had it done just for maintenance. It was something that I had carefully researched, I picked a very qualified surgeon, I was fully aware of the risks and the rewards'.

When Mr Paxman said he still didn't understand why she did it, Mrs Mensch replied: 'I like the way I look and I wanted to keep it that way. And I'm very happy with the results.

'I had a very, very good surgeon. The difference is subtle if you get somebody who knows what they are doing.'

After the show Mrs Mensch got in a row on Twitter when a member of the public accused her of lying when she was in Parliament.

'That's libellous b*******. A real slander and a slur. Refused to answer question,' she wrote.

'Refusing to answer a sexist question is not a denial.'

Response: The former MP called the statement 'libellous b*******' denying that she had lied or denied it

Final statement: The chick-lit author again claimed the original questions asked about her facelift were sexist so she refused to answer it

In her column in The Sun this morning she said that women should be able to 'make their own decisions about their own bodies', adding she admired 59-year-old supermodel Christie Brinkley.

'My Anti-ageing idol is Christie Brinkley. If she's had work done, you know, so what? The girl looks absolutely amazing'.

Last year she condemned the ‘trivialisation’ of women politicians judged on their appearance.

The
 former backbencher, who rose to prominence during Rupert Murdoch’s  
grilling on phone-hacking by the Commons culture committee, used a 
glamorous photo shoot and interview with GQ magazine to make the claim.

Younger than her years: Christie Brinkley looked youthful and toned as 
she filmed a workout video 
on Santa Monica beach last month, and Louise Mensch calls the supermodel her 'anti-ageing idol'

'You don't trivialise a woman politician based on her ap­pearance, ' she told GQ.

'As the pieces flowed in the next day, everything I had said was washed away under the fluffy-bunny thing of looks'.

In August last year she sensationally quit as an MP, saying she could not represent Corby in Northamptonshire because she could not juggle her political and family life. Mrs Mensch moved to New York with her three children to live with her second husband Peter, who manages rock group Metallica.

After years of refusing to reveal if she had a facelift, Louise Mensch has at last admitted she had one. But there is still speculation about the exact procedure the former MP had. 

It is believed she had a version of the 'Chicago Facelift', which is well known because it is done under local anaesthetic and causes less bruising and noticeable scarring than a full facelift.

A procedure of this speed, which takes just a few days to recover from, could have allowed Mrs Mensch to have had one during the summer Parliamentary recess in 2011.

After meeting her that year Guardian interviewer Decca Aitkenhead said she saw 'incisions in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet that look so fresh... they still have tiny lines of scab'.

Mrs Mensch replied to her at the time: I'm going to refuse to answer your question, because if I did that I'd become the "minister for mascara". She added: 'My beauty secrets are between me and my various, er, therapists. I'm refusing to answer your question. But you should note that I'm not denying anything.'

She may have had something similar to the procedure known as the One-Stitch Lift. Under local anaesthetic, a small semicircle of skin is cut away where the hair-line meets the ear, exposing the cheek muscle.

The muscle is then pulled tight and the skin is sewn shut with a running stitch.

Another common version of the quick Chicago Facelift is something called
 the 'silhouette lift'. Very fine threads, almost like fishing wire, are
 inserted under the skin and used to pull up the face via a series of 
incisions on the scalp.

There is also the Short-Scar 
Facelift, where incisions are made above and around the ear before the flesh is pulled tight.

It is carried out under general anaesthetic and takes about two weeks to recover from, with patients banned from any strenuous exercise, including sex and housework.
