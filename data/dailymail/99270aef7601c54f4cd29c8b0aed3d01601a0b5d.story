Would you class yourself as a night owl or more of a morning person? Be careful how you answer because it could give clues to your personality traits.

Australian researchers have discovered that a preference for staying up late or into the early hours has a direct link to anti-social behaviour and so-called Dark Triad traits.

The Dark Triad traits consist of narcissistic and selfish actions, cunning or deceitful Machiavellian behaviour and psychopathic tendencies.

Australian researchers have found a direct link between night owls, people who stay awake into the early hours, and narcissistic or psychopathic behaviour. These behaviours form what's called the Dark Triad of personality traits and the study claims people who prefer evenings to mornings are more anti-social

The Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy.

The narcissistic personality is characterised by a 'grandiose self-view, a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy, and egotism.

The Machiavellian personality is characterised by manipulation and exploitation of others, with a disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest and deception.

A psychopathic personality is characterised by thrill-seeking, selfishness, callousness, lack of personal affect, superficial charm, and remorselessness.

The paper from Dr Peter Jonason from the University of Sydney surveyed 263 students online.

The average age was 24 and there were 74 men and 189 women involved.

Participants were asked about their chronotype. A person's chronotype reflects at what time of the day their hormone levels, temperature, brain function, eating and sleeping are most active, change or reach a certain level.

People who are more active and feel more alert in the morning are referred to as 'larks', while people who prefer late evening hours are classed as 'owls'.

Questions included, 'During the first half hour after you wake up in the morning, how do you feel?'

People were then rated based on a narcissism scale and were asked how strongly they agreed with statements including 'I have a natural talent for influencing people.'

Future studies are being planned to look at whether larks, people who function best in the morning, portray certain behaviour types as well, in a bid to see whether bodies actually do function at different times of the day, or whether people just perceive that they do

They were additionally asked how they felt about statements made on the psychopathy scale, for example, 'I think I could beat a lie detector', and a Machiavellian scale, such as 'It is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there'.

Across the 263 students, the darker a participant's personality score, the more they tended to be an 'owl' and said they functioned more effectively in the evening hours.

People who feel more active and alert in the morning are referred to as 'larks', while people who prefer late evening hours are classed as 'owls'

This was also the case when the three traits were analysed separately; each trait was stronger in people who considered themselves to be night owls.

The paper claims the results are consistent with a 'niche-specialisation' hypothesis.

Niche specialisation is the process where traits have developed over time, through evolution.

Dr Jonason said in the study: 'It could be adaptively effective for anyone pursuing a fast life strategy like that embodied in the Dark Triad to occupy and exploit a low-light environment where others are sleeping and having diminished cognitive functioning.

Such features of the night may facilitate the causal sex, mate-poaching, and risk-taking the Dark Triad traits are linked to.'

For example, humans and animals may have evolved to be night owls because the low-light conditions made it possible to carry out these behaviours and actions without being seen.

Dr Jonason concludes that more work is needed, but the results highlight an important step in the study of the darker aspects of human nature.

Future studies are being planned to look at whether larks portray certain behaviour types, in a bid to see whether bodies actually do function at different times of the day, or whether people just perceive that they do.
