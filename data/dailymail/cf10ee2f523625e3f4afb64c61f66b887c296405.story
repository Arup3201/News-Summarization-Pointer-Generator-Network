A petite mom of four has chomped through another eating world record on Sunday just two days after gulping down hundreds of wings.

Molly Schuyler, who is 5'7 and weighs 125lb, took down the Adam Emmenecker sandwich in four minutes, 50 seconds - two minutes faster than her previous best time.

Mrs Schuyler, 33, devoured the 5lb sandwich - along with 1lb of waffle fries - in front of cheering crowds at Jethro’s Pork Chop Grill in Johnston, Iowa.

Mrs Schuyler, 33, ate the 5lb sandwich - along with 1lb of waffle fries - to cheering crowds at Jethro's Pork Chop Grill in Johnston, Iowa

Molly Schuyler, who at 5'7 weighs 125lb, ate the 5lb sandwich in under 5 minutes at the Iowa restaurant

The Adam Emmenecker sandwich weighs 5lb and contains pork, steak burger, brisket, chicken tenders and a lake of melted cheese, coming in at around 6,000 calories

The sandwich is made up of a 14-inch pork tenderloin, Angus steak burger, slabs of Texas brisket, applewood bacon and fried cheese, finished wth buffalo chicken tenders.

It is then smothered in melted cheddar cheese and white chedder sauce and comes with a side.

The monster sandwich has a warning attached: 'This could hurt you!' and a price tag of $24.95.

The Adam Emmenecker comes in at around 6,000 calories.

Mrs Schuyler, from Bellevue, Nebraska, told desmoinesregister.com: 'I tried to swallow most of it all. If it’s soft you can just swallow it.'

She said that her technique was 'divide and conquer'.

The mother-of-four became the first woman to complete the sandwich challenge in 2012 and has eaten the mammoth meal another four times since. 

The eating feat came just two days after
 Mrs Schuyler, a waitress, devoured 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes at a competitive 
eating contest in Philadelphia, the Wing Bowl 22.

Then on Saturday, she munched through 59 pancakes in 20 minutes during a competition at a Pancake Bowl at IHOP in Urbandale, Iowa.

Then later came a stellar performance at the
 Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival where she defended her title from last year by eating 2lb of bacon in three and a half minutes.

The mom-of-four even helped her children clear their plates after she finished the massive sandwich

On Friday at 8am, the mom swallowed hundreds of chicken wings for her breakfast as second-place finisher
 Patrick Bertoletti from Chicago could only chomp home in second place 
with a total of 356 wing.

Mrs Schuyler, whose performance host Angelo Cataldi dubbed 'the greatest ever', won $22,000.

Asked by Mr Cataldi what she would do with the money, Schuyler said, 'I have car payments and kids, so it's all good.'

'Who eats 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes?' Mr Cataldi asked, still mystified by the performance.

The petite mother from Nebraska chowed down 2lb of bacon on Saturday (after finishing 59 pancakes)

She's no chicken: Molly Schuyler, who stands 5'7" tall and weighs just 125 pounds, ate 363 chicken wings to take the crown - and set a new Wing Bowl record

Victory! Molly Schuyler is the champion chicken eater!

Not bad for a morning's work: Molly Schuyler is handed the winning check for $22,000 before heading to Iowa for her next eating competition

Ms. Schuyler breezed to the first-round lead, eating 186 wings in 14 minutes as the top 10 advanced.

One of those eliminated in the first round was Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, who managed only 65 wings.

The second round lasted 14 minutes, and the final round was a two-minute sprint to the finish.

'To tell you the truth, I didn’t even think I was going to win this, I was looking and hoping to finish in the top three,' said Ms. Schuyler to CBS 3.

'We come from Omaha and we don't really have the kind of wings you guys have out here,' she said smiling. 'I had to ''wing'' it.'

Where did it all go? Molly has a petite frame. At 5ft 7in and 125 pounds, her eating abilities are truly incredible

'I think I could eat some more,' Ms Schuyler said with the Wing Bowl 22 crown skewed on her head.

'This was freaking crazy. I kept eating and I kept saying I didn’t want to know how many wings I ate until the end. I just wanted to focus on what I was doing. But I don’t think I want to eat another chicken wing for a while. Hopefully I’ll be back next year.'

Each year, Wing Bowl brings out some of the region’s best competitive eaters, who themselves have to prove their worth to qualify for the event by performing a miraculous feat of eating.

To qualify for the Wing Bowl, Schuyler ate nine pounds of cottage cheese in 114 seconds. She also holds a world record for eating a 72-ounce steak in less than three minutes.

The previous record of 337 was established in 2012 by one of the world's best-known competitive eaters Takeru Kobayashi.

The only other woman to ever win the contest was Sonya “The Black Widow” Thomas, who won Wing Bowl 12 with 167 wings in 2004.

Wing Bowl creator Al Morganti had predicted Ms Schuyler odds-on favorite for the event at 2-1.

Asked whether she would return next year to defend her championship, presumably still feeling rather full, Ms. Schuyler said, 'maybe!'

Large appetite: Previously, Molly Schuyler wolfed down a 72oz steak in 2 minutes 44 
seconds, earning her a place in the world record books

Non stop: Earlier this year, Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by 
demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large 
soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland

Talking about her speed-eating abilities, she added: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon.

‘I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.'

Her husband Sean also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating'.

In 2013 Mrs Schuyler competed in more than 20 different food eating contests across the country.

Victories included eating 9lbs of fried mushrooms in 8 minutes and eight beef patties in 1 minute and 46 seconds.

All Pro Eating, the world's only independent competitive eating organization, lists her as the world's number one female.
