Angelina Jolie is teaming up with Stella McCartney to design a children's clothing line inspired by her upcoming Disney movie Maleficent.

According to WWD, the collection will feature sparkly princess dresses and sandals for girls and 'edgy T-shirts and sneakers' for boys, with prices ranging from $75 to $185.

No doubt the 38-year-old actress had her own children in mind - three of whom will have cameos in the film - when she decided to launch the clothing line, which is aimed at kids aged four to 14.

One adorable look from the line is a purple leopard print dress, modeled by a young girl who pairs it with matching purple horns akin to the ones Ms Jolie dons in the movie trailer.

Another ensemble, this time geared towards boys, includes a white and grey shirt with a drawing of a dragon. It's unclear whether the boy's grey wings and black horns will also be part of the collection.

The clothes will be available in Stella McCartney stores worldwide as well as Disney stores and online at the end of April - a month before the release of the movie on May 30.

This isn't Ms McCartney's first foray into Disney-themed fashion; in 2010, the designer created a jewelry collection for Disney inspired by Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

And in 2009, she featured some characters from Bambi in an ad campaign, including the fawn himself and Thumper the rabbit.

'I've always been a huge fan of Disney growing up, as was my mother, and
 I grew up watching all the films like most kids did,' explained Ms McCartney.

'When the opportunity presented itself and I was invited by Angelina Jolie to visit the film set, I jumped at the chance.'

Ten per cent of the sales made from the collection will be put towards SOS Children's Villages, a charity that helps provide homes for children in need.

Ms Jolie has revealed in the past that she and Brad Pitt don't want their children to be actors, but that having her five-year-old daughter Vivienne co-star with her in Maleficent was something of a last resort.

'The other three-and four-year-old [performers] wouldn't come near me,' she admitted to Entertainment Weekly.

'It had to be a child that liked me and wasn't afraid of my horns and my eyes and my claws. So it had to be Viv.
