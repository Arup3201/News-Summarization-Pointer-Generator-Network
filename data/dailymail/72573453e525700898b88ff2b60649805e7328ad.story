An oil painting bought at a golf club auction for £3,700 is believed to be a long lost work by famous painter JMW Turner worth up to £20million.

Convinced the small painting was done by Britain’s most loved painter, art investor Jonathan Weal made sure he had the winning bid at the auction eight years ago.

Now historians and scientists are backing up his claim after tests dated the oil on panel to 1805 and a handwriting expert verified the signature on the work was Turner’s.

Long lost Turner: An art investor bought this oil on panel entitled 
Fishing Boats In A Stiff Breeze at a golf club auction for less than 
£4,000 which experts now believe is a JMW Turner painting worth up to 
£20million

Art insurers Hiscox are said to have put the multi-million pound valuation on the masterpiece, entitled Fishing Boats in a Stiff Breeze.

Mr Weal came across the 13in by 10in painting at the auction in Wealden, Kent in 2004 where amazingly it was even catalogued as a Turner, even though it had a reserve price of just £700 to £900.

He said: ‘I eventually had to go up to £3,700, four times the estimate, so there must have been some others in the audience who suspected it was seriously valuable.

Same Turner time: Scientific dating tests found that the mystery painting was from the same year Turner painted his famous masterpiece The Battle of Trafalgar, pictured

‘I always back my judgement.

‘My
mother was an antiquarian bookseller, and she used to take me to the 
Victoria and Albert Museum regularly, so I have always been interested 
in art.’

Scientific tests date the painting, 
inscribed on the panel along with the title, from the same year Turner 
painted his famous The Battle of Trafalgar.

Turner is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings. And while he is renowned for his oil paintings, Turner is also considered one of the greatest masters of British watercolour landscape painting.

Turner scholar Dr Selby Whittingham 
is among six experts who will present support evidence at a conference 
at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London next Wednesday.

Mr Weal said: ‘Turner spent a lot of time in Ramsgate and I believe 
he painted it at a spot between Ramsgate and Broadstairs, funnily enough
an area where Nelson used to pick up a lot of his men to go to sea.

‘It is of great historical importance because we believe Turner gave the painting to his great friend the Reverend Trimmer, who was with him at his death and became his executor.’

Mr Weal believes that after Henry Scott Trimmer’s death the painting was sold in 1860, passing through several hands until disappearing from public view, until now.

Dr Whittingham said it is unlikely to be a fake for many reasons.

He said: ‘It seems unlikely to be a fake on various grounds. No one appears to have made any money out of it, so what would have been the point?

‘It is an oil painting as well, and 
most of the Turner fakes have been of his watercolours. And tests on the
pigments used date it to about the right time to make it authentic.

‘This does not prove a particular artist was responsible but it helps to rule out forgeries from a later time.

‘It would be nice to know a little 
bit more about the history of it. It may have been in an earlier London 
sale, but I have no idea who owned it before Jonathan Weal.’

‘It is often quite difficult to find these things out but I would say on the balance of probabilities it is a Turner.’

An 18 page report by Art Access and 
Research, to be presented at the conference, says: ‘Work thus far has 
not revealed any features wholly inconsistent with the hypothesis that 
the painting was executed by Turner in 1805.’

Weight of evidence: Dr Whittingham said 'the balance of probabilities it is a Turner'

Dr
Whittingham said there was ‘historical significance’ of a painting 
listed as missing in Butlin and Joll’s 1980s study of Turner works.

He said: ‘It belongs to a group of 
small works which are neglected. All the concentration tends to be on 
the big works exhibited at the Royal Academy.

‘Turner painted on this small scale not for exhibition but more personal reasons. 

‘Turner gave the works to friends, and most have remained in private collections.’

Proving the painting’s authenticity might prove to be less straightforward, with more than one expert giving reasons to doubt it was a Turner work.

Dr Whittingham said one dismissed it because it was on a panel.

He said: ‘That is an absurd reason. Turner painted other things on panel.

It is for others to give reasons why it’s not by Turner. The weight of the evidence is that it is.

‘It is an oil painting, which is partly what makes it interesting and rarer. Watercolours do turn up quite frequently.’

The record price for a Turner work is £29.7million when Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino was sold in 2010.

Art and antiques dealer Frank Faryab recently convinced leading art authorities that he was in possession of a lost Turner which could be worth about £4million.

He spent more than £2million to restore the painting, gathering scientific evidence including infrared dating, checking fingerprints and artistic tests to prove its provenance.
