More grim details emerged about the drug practices of the white supremacist couple who got high and had oral sex with a teenage babysitter who died that night.

As a part of the ongoing trial of Dea Millerberg, the wife of Eric Millerberg, who is accused of helping him dispose of 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen's dead body in September 2011, the Utah court heard more about the couple's drug friendly attitude.

Mr Millerberg is a member of the Silent Arayan Warriors, a white supremacist gang, and one of his peers wrote a letter from prison about the torrid details that Mr Millerberg confessed.

Trouble: At the time of Alexis' death, Eric Millerberg was on parole for prior burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang

Help: Police reportedly received a confidential tip about the whereabouts of Alexis' body by members of Eric Millerberg's gang

Gang member Casey Peterson said Mr 
Millerberg called himself a 'watcher of the flock' meaning that he felt 
it important that he be the one to help teens do drugs 'so they wouldn't
go elsewhere and try it on their own'

One of Alexis' friends, whose name was
not released, also testified that the two of them would go over to the 
Millerberg's house to smoke drugs, and that the 36-year-old man was the 
one to teach them how to smoke methamphetamine out of a light bulb.

Peterson's statement, which was read 
in court, confirmed the account of the night given by Mrs Millerberg, 
saying that Alexis died in their home because of the drugs and they 
could not revive her.

The letter also detailed Mr 
Millerberg's rehashing of he and his wife's sexual dalliances and drug 
use with the teen prior to her death.

'I was paranoid and I did not want to be involved,' wrote Peterson, who is currently serving time for unknown charges.

His motivation to help, however, was more personal: 'I have a 16-year-old daughter.'

Peterson was not the only gang member 
who found the Millerberg's behavior to be an affront, as Eric Smith has 
been identified as the police informant who tipped them off to the 
location of the body.

Serious charges: Eric Millerberg, 36, is charged with far more involvement than his wife, and is said to be the one who actually killed the girl by injecting her with drugs

Dark side: During her testimony, Dea Millerberg said that Alexis asked the couple if she could have sex with them in August- a month before she died- and also requested to be paid with meth instead of cash

'I wanted the family to have closure,' Mr Smith said.

'Then again, they came at me and said they knew about my involvement in it and that they'd give me immunity if I helped them.'

New details also painted a grizzly 
picture of the body itself when it was finally found, as detective Mike 
Tribe said that Alexis's corpse was found kneeling face down, covered in
brush in a rural part of Morgan County.

He said that her neon toe nail polish, ankle bracelets and jawline helped identify her.

The added details come a day after Dea Millerberg told a Salt Lake City courtroom about the extent of their relationship with the girl before her death, including their varied drug use and group sex sessions.

Months
after the September 10 death of Alexis, the Millerbergs were charged 
for their involvement in her death and Mrs Millerberg testified against 
her husband in court on Monday after receiving immunity for any direct 
involvement with the girl’s death.

Mrs Millerberg faces one third-degree 
felony charge relating to the disposal of Alexis’ body, but prosecutors 
have called her overall involvement ‘minimal’ as compared to Mr 
Millerberg’s, as he faces charges of child abuse homicide, unlawful sex 
with a minor, the disposal of the body and obstruction of justice.

The 39-year-old, who filed for 
divorce from her husband after they were charged with the death of 
Alexis, told the torrid story of how the couple befriended and corrupted
the young girl in the months leading up to her death.

Mrs
Millerberg said that they started using Alexis- or Lexi as she called 
her- as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011.

Accomplice: Dea Millerberg, seen here in an earlier court appearance, discussed how she helped her husband Eric dispose of Alexis Rasmussen's body

Corrupted: Alexis Rasmussen, 16, reportedly asked the Millerbergs how to get meth and they started smoking the drug, along with heroin and marijuana, with the girl

They
became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with 
the teen before Alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like 
methamphetamine and heroin. Eventually they even began paying Alexis in meth.

One of their most raucous nights as a 
group came in August, a month before her death, when Alexis reportedly 
asked to become sexually involved with the married couple.

'Eric and I started kissing and having sex. Then Alexis jumped in,' Mrs Millerberg told the court.

On
the fateful night of September 10, the couple wanted Alexis to babysit 
because they were going to go shopping for their daughter’s birthday. 
Neither babysitting nor shopping ended up happening.

As
soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Mr Millerberg helped her get high 
by injecting her with drugs- once with heroin and twice with meth- into 
her arm and neck.

Found: A full autopsy could not be performed because Alexis' body was so decomposed, but significant traces of heroin and meth were in her system

Then, 
when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, she and her husband 
performed oral sex on one another. Mrs Millerberg says that she was not 
involved in the encounter.

A short while later, the drugs had a 
negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She 
reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a 
warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom.

After leaving her alone in the bath at 
her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to 
find that she was still cold, so Mrs Millerberg wrapped her in a blanket
and told her to lie down in another bedroom.

The couple left her to go smoke some cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive.

‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Mrs Millerberg, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail.

They then tried to figure out what to do next.

‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court.

Mr Millerberg was on parole at the 
time for prior burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be
part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang.

Mrs
Millerberg, who also had outstanding court dates due to her involvement
with two unrelated prescription drug fraud and child endangerment 
cases, says that she dressed the then-naked body of Alexis and put it 
into a foot locker which the couple moved into a box in the trunk of 
their car.

Leaving their 
6-year-old daughter at home but taking their toddler with them, they 
'drove all over the place' disposing of any evidence that may connect 
them to the crime.

They 
dumped her body in a remote area of Morgan County where Mr Millerberg 
covered it with brush and shrubs so that it was hidden. Police only 
found it six weeks after Alexis’ death with the help of a confidential 
tip from Eric Smith, one of Mr Millerberg’s gang members.

Moving
on to the remaining evidence, they left Alexis' purse in one dumpster 
with the box that had held the body, then drove to a different dumpster 
where they left the carpet from the car 'in case there was any evidence 
on it'.

Facing trial: Eric Millerberg is in prison awaiting trial and Dea Millerberg (right) is free on bail

Spot: The couple- along with their toddler- drove around extensively disposing of Alexis' body and all evidence. She was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death

After filing for divorce from Mr Millerberg in February, Mrs Millerberg is free on bail but police say that she will ‘not get a walk on all of (her) charges’.

So far, police officials seem to agree with Mrs Millerberg’s version of events though a full autopsy could not be completed because of the decomposition of the body. The state medical examiner did conclude that there was a serious amount of meth and heroin in the girl’s body at her time of death.

‘Drugs are dangerous and unpredictable. Every time you use drugs there is a chance of death,’ said medical examiner Dr Joseph White.

Prosecutor Chris Shaw included the other charges against Mr Millerberg in his assessment, saying: ‘After a lengthy period of drug use ... and sexual misconduct, she died.’
