Igor and Marek Marcin offered their unsuspecting victims the promise of a better life in the UK.

But for 15 men who travelled from eastern Europe the reality was very different - they were forced to live in cramped conditions with other workers, and were given just a fraction of their wages.

The brothers, from Slovakia, are today behind bars, after admitting trafficking men into the country.

Igor Marcin, left, and his brother Marek, right, were jailed for trafficking men from eastern Europe into the UK, promising them a better life. Judge Jonathan Gosling told the pair they 'dehumanised' their 15 victims

Sentencing the pair, Judge Jonathan Gosling, said their exploitation was 'targeted and cynical'.

He told them: 'In a word, these men were dehumanised.'

Igor Marcin, 36, from Derby, was jailed for four years and four months while 40-year-old Marek, also of Derby, was given a three years and four month sentence.

The Marcins preyed on vulnerable men, who were desperate of a better life.

They offered their victims a good job, accommodation and food.

But when their victims, who were of Slovak and Czech origin, arrived in Derby they found a very different reality.

They were forced to live in the defendants' homes, sharing bedrooms and sleeping on mattresses on the floor, prosecutor Jonathan Spicer said.

They were fed at set meal times but were banned from taking food from the kitchen at any other time.

They had no access to the internet or post, and were allowed little or no social interaction with their fellow victims.

The brothers took away their victims' identity documents and passports and forced them to open bank accounts, from which they gave them 'pocket money' of around £10 or £20, while they took the rest for themselves.

The men had no access to their earnings, were not given bank cards or allowed any of the documentation relating to their accounts.

Igor Marcin's wife Dagmar Marcinova, admitted fraud and theft and was jailed for 10 months. Marek's wife, Gabriela Marcinova, also admitted a charge of theft and was sentenced to eight months in prison

One victim was under the impression his wages were being held but would eventually be given to him, the court heard.

Mr Spicer said: 'He understood his money was being saved for him by Igor so he did not question why he was only earning £20 a week.'

One man was told he owed money to pay off the travel costs to the UK but the money taken far exceeded this cost.

Benefits and tax credits were also claimed in the names of their victims, Derby Crown Court heard.

Following the sentencing, one victim spoke out about his treatment and how the brothers had taken all his documents and most of his wages, leaving him with no means of escape.

In a statement released through police Frantisek Ruzicka, 44, said he was brought to Derby from the Czech Republic and shared a room in a house in Cameron Road with three other men.

Describing the conditions he lived in, he said: 'It wasn’t full of fleas but there were beetles. There were four of us in one room.

'I would wake up at 3am and you are being eaten alive by these flat beetles. You have got all these spots all over the place. At 6am, you are supposed to be getting up and going to work.

'I was working in a flower factory and you have bites all over the place and you want to scratch yourself but you can’t. The itching was terrible, I really couldn’t cope.

'They had all my documents so it was impossible to get work elsewhere. I was thinking of going back to the Czech Republic but I had no money so how could I?'

Mr Ruzicka said he hopes his experience will encourage other people in the same situation to contact police.

He added: 'Do not be afraid. Tell the police and police will deal with it. All those people who were in charge were arrested.

'They wanted a lot and now they have ended up with nothing.'

The charges related to 12 men, but a total of 15 had been identified, between 2010 and July 2013, when the brothers were arrested.

The men were made to work in a number of jobs including at car washes, as flower packers, and in food factories.

The court heard more than £101,000 had been claimed in state benefits and tax credits by the Marcins, and a further £53,444 was stolen from the wages paid to the workers.

The court also hear that on two occasions Marek Marcin assaulted one of the men when he complained about his circumstances.

'He was saying to him words to the effect: ‘Who is the boss?’ He was slapped round the face.'

It was only when one of the victims plucked up the courage to go to the Salvation Army last April and tell them his story that the dire situation the men were in came to light.

Judge Gosling told the brothers they had 'carefully selected' their victims.

'Their own description of their circumstances in Slovakia - leading rather lonely, aimless lives with scant family support - made them an easy target for your plan,' he said.

The Marcins both pleaded guilty to offences under section four of the 2004 Asylum and Immigration Act.

Igor’s wife Dagmar Marcinova, 38, who admitted fraud and theft, was sentenced to 10 months.

She took money from one of the victim’s bank accounts and stole cash from another.

Marek’s wife Gabriela Marcinova, 42, pleaded guilty to theft after stealing money belonging to one of the victims. She was sentenced to eight months.

Both women walked free from court because they have already served half of their sentences since they were remanded in custody following their arrests last year.

The two couples were arrested on July 15 by Derbyshire police officers, the National Crime Agency’s UK Human Trafficking Centre and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA), who visited several addresses across Derby.

They found 12 victims of human trafficking at the houses. The men were taken to a special reception centre, set up by Derbyshire County Council, Derby City Council, the Salvation Army and the British Red Cross.

A police spokeswoman said nine of the victims have returned to their home countries while three remain in the UK, being supported by police and specialist charities.

The officer in charge of the case, Detective Inspector Emlyn Richards, today welcomed the sentence.

He said: 'While we are obviously pleased that the Marcin brothers and their wives have been sentenced, the real success of this operation is that these victims are no longer being exploited.

'When they arrived at the reception centre and started to tell us what had happened to them, we were shocked by what we were hearing.

'They lived in cramped conditions, with just a mattress on the floor to sleep on, and were only receiving a fraction of what they were actually earning - around £15 to £25 for a full working week.

'Meanwhile, the Marcin family were driving around in high-value cars. The traffickers kept the men’s documents so they had no way of leaving.

'Some of the men had chemical burns where they had been made to work at car washes in just their slippers.

'The chemicals had seeped through the footwear and burnt their skin. One victim told of how he removed his own tooth because he was denied access to a dentist.

'We were also told of a man who had suffered constant earache but was denied medical treatment.

'To end the pain he was in, he perforated his own ear drum.

'Another victim told us how over several months he had managed to save about £55, which he intended to use to escape and buy a flight home.

'He returned from working one day to find his room had been searched and the money had been stolen.'

GLA chief executive Paul Broadbent added: 'This was a shocking example of people driven by nothing but greed lining their pockets at the expense of the health, welfare and safety of men who were forced to work for them.

'It may shock the people of Derby to learn that the horrific practice of human trafficking is happening in their city. Regrettably, it comes as no surprise to the GLA because we know this can and does happen everywhere.

'The kind of organised criminal scam being operated by these two couples is typical of cases we are uncovering on a regular basis across the country.

'We will continue to work in partnership with the police, the NCA and all other relevant organisations to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable people and make sure offenders are convicted just like they were in this case.'
