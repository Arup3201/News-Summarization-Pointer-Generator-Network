Who knew that lurking under one shiny college football helmet was another ridiculously photogenic Internet sensation just waiting to be discovered?

Meet Cam McDaniel, a running back at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, whose helmet lifted clean off during a recent pile up to reveal a chiseled jaw and smoldering stare more suited to plugging designer aftershave.

McDaniel appears to float serenely above the scrum of USC players on the field on October 19, his perfectly tousled hair remaining in place.

Mr McDaniel's image has swept the web, with hundreds of adoring comments being posted on social media.

One Twitter user Molly remarked: 'Definitely think running into that gauntlet backwards gave Cam McDaniel super powers. If nothing else, it made him photogenic.'

Another Casey E tweeted: 'Do you ever look at Cam McDaniel and think that that is the closest you'll ever come to a personal gift from God?'

Meredith McFrost posted: 'Cam McDaniel is really handsome at football.'

Memes have already started doing the rounds with taglines such as: 'Takes quarterback's handoff... and his heart'; 'Guy trying to tackle him... just wanted to touch him' and 'Scores touchdown... wins America's next top model'.

But many of Mr McDaniel's fans will be disappointed to learn that the student football player is already engaged - to his gorgeous blonde fiancée Stephani Sterrett.

The college football star joins a line of ridiculously photogenic sporty individuals to emerge from the masses.

In March, the world got to know Clark Gracie, a 28-year-old Jiu Jitsu instructor from San Diego whose attractive pout while grappling with an opponent earned him dozens of memes.

The tags included: 'Doesn't need a triangle choke… To take your breath away'; ‘Locks up your arm… And your heart' and 'Here to break limbs... ends up breaking hearts'.

Last year New England Patriots wide receiver Brandon Lloyd was lauded as ridiculously photogenic after he smiled straight at the camera during his first touchdown of the season.

In March last year, Zeddie Little became one of the first 'ridiculously photogenic people' to sweep the web after an amateur photographer took a picture of his adorable grinning face on the last stretch of a 10K race in Charleston, South Carolina.
