Vandals have daubed 'Martinez out' and 'Not good enough' slogans on the outside of Goodison Park in protest at Everton's poor season.

The graffiti, aimed at manager Roberto Martinez, appeared in white paint on the back of the Bullens Road and Goodison Road stands overnight.

A member of Everton club staff was seen painting over the messages early on Sunday morning.

Everton's chances of winning silverware this season ended with defeat to Dynamo Kiev on Thursday

Everton have endured a difficult season and sit 14th in the table ahead of Sunday afternoon's trip to Queens Park Rangers, having won just two of their last 13 league games.

Unlike the last campaign, they have been unable to sustain a push for the European places and hopes of silverware were ended when Dynamo Kiev knocked them out of the Europa League in midweek.
