The clothes Jane Bashara was wearing the day of her murder have gone missing - and may have been disposed of, it has been revealed.

After the 56-year-old’s body was discovered in her SUV the morning of January 25, her remains, as well as the clothes she was wearing, were sent to the A.H. Peters Funeral Home in Grosse Pointe Woods.

However, the Michigan State crime lab never got the marketing executive’s clothing, and there it is possibility that the evidence could have been destroyed, a fact which is devastating to all parties involved.

Crucial evidence: The clothes Jane Bashara was wearing the day she was murdered have gone missing and may have been thrown out

The forensic evidence alone could have exonerated Bob Bashara, Ms Bashara’s husband, his attorney David Griem told the Detroit Free Press.

Or, it may have provided new insight into the case for 48-year-old handyman Joseph Gentz, who was arrested last week and charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Gentz’s court-appointed attorney Susan Reed, told the Free Press: ‘You’d think they’d keep track of it, but maybe I’ve been watching too much CSI on television.

She added: ‘And what do I know? I’ve only been trying murder cases for 30-some years.’

Records from the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office show that she was brought there for an autopsy on January 26 and was dropped off at the A.H Peters Funeral home the next day.

The black stretch pants, green-blue blouse, house shoes, and underwear were released to the funeral home by Bob Bashara, records show.

Murder: Jane Bashara lived with her husband Bob in the upper-Middle class neighbourhood of Grosse Point, Michicagn

Funeral director Phillip Potter told the Free Press yesterday that he didn’t recall what happened to the clothing. However, it is customary procedure to dispose of clothing not requested by police, especially if it was blood-stained or dirty.

Mr Griem said the loss of the clothing is ‘devastating news for the family,’ adding: ‘This is a significant roadblock in the search for truth and justice for Jane Bashara.’

'You'd think they'd keep track of (the evidence), but maybe I’ve been watching too much CSI. What do I know? I’ve only been trying murder cases for 30-some years.'

Many are again questioning the quality of police work done in the case, which has come into question multiple times.

The Bashara’s Grosse Pointe home was searched twice; it was only after the second search that blood was recovered in the garage. And the home of Bob Bashara’s alleged mistress was only searched last week.

Handyman Joseph Gentz, 48, was 
arraigned for first-degree murder last week after police arrested him 
more than a month after he admitted to killing marketing executive Jane 
Bashara.

Gentz is also 
facing conspiracy charges, which likely mean authorities believe more 
than one person was involved, though that doesn’t indicate that person 
would be charged.

Grosse 
Pointe police raided the home of Bob Bashara’s alleged mistress. Rachel 
Gillet, 50, had told police earlier that she and Mr Bashara were dating.

She was not named a person of interest in the case.

Gentz was released last month from the Detroit prison after police claimed they not find enough evidence against him. His release was yet another bizarre twist in the murder mystery of Ms Bashara, who was found dead in January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home.

ABC News reported that five unmarked police cars surrounded Ms Gillet’s home early this morning, and left around four hours later carrying seven cardboard boxes, a paper bag, and an additional evidence box.

The building’s landlord, Phyllis Huxley, told ABC News that she never received a warrant and was not asked permission before officers entered the home.

Meanwhile, Gentz’s court-appointed attorney Susan Reed told the Detroit Free Press that she hasn’t discussed a plea deal with her client.

Attorney David Griem said he was unsure if his client Bob Bashara would be charged in the case. ‘I don’t have a crystal ball,’ he said.

Nevertheless, he speculated: ‘I guess the next step is to offer Joe Gentz a deal he can’t refuse to testify against Bob Bashara.’

Gentz was already wearing blue prison
attire at the time of his arraignment. CBS Detroit’s 
legal analyst speculated that Gentz’s arrest would by no means be the 
last in this case.

‘Conspiracy means by definition, some
other person. I cannot conspire with myself to commit murder. I need 
somebody else. And the big question of the day: Who is that person?’

Ms Bashara’s husband Bob, 54, has 
been in the public eye for his place in the murder, for one because 
police discovered a secret S&M dungeon in one of Mr Bashara’s 
properties, and more significantly because Gentz told officers that Mr 
Barshara requested the hit on his wife.

Mr Bashara, who remains a person of 
interest, maintains his innocence. Last month, he told ABC News 
exclusively: ‘I did nothing wrong. I didn’t commit murder. I didn’t pay 
to have my wife killed. I’m going to see this through to the end. And 
I’m innocent.’

Meanwhile, Gentz remains in jail, and pending a competency evaluation, will appear in court March 16 for a preliminary exam.

When police first began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder.

Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible.

Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death.

Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family.

'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press.

Bashara initially told police about the night his wife died: 'I got home and she wasn’t 
around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Mr Bashara told 7 Action News.

'As
9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more 
people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard 
from her and they hadn’t.

'I
had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I 
involved the police because I was concerned there might be something 
wrong.'

After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing.

Speaking to the Detroit Free Press, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and 
did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere.

'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through
in the last moments of her life.'

Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company.

The Detroit News reported that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities.

'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'
