Bloodied: Shelby Figueroa, 18, is facing multiple charges after allegedly breaking free from a pair of handcuffs, stealing a deputy's vehicle, and leading officials on a high-speed chase through the mountains of Colorado

An 18-year-old woman has been arrested after she slipped free of handcuffs, stole a police car, and lead officers on a drunken high speed chase through the mountains.

Shelby Figeroa was pulled over near Georgetown, Colorado, at 10am on Sunday after she rammed her red pick up into a Clear Creek Sheriff deputy's vehicle.

When she failed to cooperate, the officer handcuffed her and put her in the back of his SUV.

But within minutes, the teen had managed to escape the cuffs, jump behind the wheel and zoom off in the patrol car, with the lights on and sirens blaring.

'We're westbound 224. Speeds are 100,' a state trooper told dispatchers.

'She's got lights and sirens on in the deputy's car. It's an unmarked white Expedition, Excursion.'

Video from the police car shows how the woman was ducking and diving between cars as she tried to evade officers.

Colorado State Patrol joined the chase at 10.10am and officers tried to curb the reckless teen using stop sticks.

But they only deflated one tire and Figeroa kept driving, according to 9 News.

Police then called for Tactical Vehicle Intervention -- trained officers who ram the back of a vehicle during a chase to run it off the road.

'I'm going to fall back and let them take the lead,' the trooper told dispatchers. 'See if we can get this car stopped.'

Charges: The young woman, pictured, is facing seven charges including aggravated motor vehicle theft and DUI

Clear Creek deputies tried twice to knock the 18-year-old girl off the road using TVI.

'She
has not lost control,' they said. 'She's very arrogant. She is doing 
that to keep me from getting up on her. Vehicle is still intact.'

Figeroa continued to weave in and out of traffic, speeding through a tunnel into nearby Frisco.

At 10.29am, a Colorado State Patrol 
trooper attempted TVI one more time, and successfully rammed the stolen 
Sheriff's Office SUV off the road.

The vehicle veered off the highway, rolled over, and crashed into a rock wall.

Figeroa was bruised and bloodied after the wreck and was rushed to Summit County Hospital by ambulance.

No other drivers were hurt in the crash as traffic was light during the chase.

The 18-year-old is being charged with attempted vehicular assault on a police officer, vehicular eluding, aggravated motor vehicle theft, resisting arrest, driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs, theft and reckless driving.
