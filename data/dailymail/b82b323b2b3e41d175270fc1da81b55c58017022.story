Her penchant for elaborate hats and red lipstick is legendary but it seems the Queen is about to shake up her elegant signature style.

Her Majesty is famous for her boxy Launer handbags and the latest version, the Judi, has been carefully calibrated to work with the royal wardrobe.

While the £1,130 arm candy retains the ladylike shape beloved of the Queen, the new version is smaller and lighter than her usual luggage and comes in a rainbow of cheerful colours.

Fit for a Queen: The new Launer Judi bag was included in the selection sent to Buckingham Palace for summer

Although the Queen usually carries the Traviata style, Launer say the Judi bag was included in the selection sent to Buckingham Palace for S/S14 - and met with a favourable reception from officials.

'Throughout 2014, Her Majesty has opted for bolder colour choices
 and our more fashion forward designs,' commented Launer London CEO, Gerald Bodmer.

'For Her Majesty to wear one
 of our Judi’s would really encapsulate her time as a British fashion 
icon.

He added: 'The Judi was actually named after Dame Judi Dench who lent her 
name after becoming the latest in a long line of British 
actresses to fall in love with our designs, so it be a really 
special patriotic statement if Her Majesty wore this design.'

The new bag is the smallest Launer have ever produced and comes in a range of bright hues, including fuschia and tangerine.

Cheerful: The new Judi bag comes in a choice of tangerine, grey, fuchsia or teal, as well as bespoke hues

Although the Queen usually plumps for the black patent option, Launer say that some of the more colourful versions were included in the selection sent to Buckingham Place.

This, say the brand, marks a new direction in their relationship with the monarch who often requests bespoke alterations and smaller 
measurements on some of Launer’s bigger styles, including the Traviata 
and Lydia handbags.

Available in dove grey, fuchsia and teal, the bag is smaller and brighter than the rest of the Launer collection and is crafted from the brand's trademark patent calf leather and finished with Launer’s new gold-plated glossy rope logo fitting.

'This is the smallest handbag style 
Launer has ever produced,' adds Bodmer. 'The bag is designed to be worn over the shoulder and sit perfectly
 on the waist.

'It’s a very chic and unique addition to the Launer 
family.'
