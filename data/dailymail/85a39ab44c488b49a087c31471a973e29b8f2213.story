England Women recovered from their losing start to the Six Nations against Wales by recording a comprehensive victory over Italy at Twickenham Stoop.

The world champions, who failed to score last weekend, ran in six tries to win 39-7.

England did not have it all their own way and trailed 7-3 after Flavia Severin scored the first try of the game, which was converted by Michela Sillari.

But the hosts hit back through Alex Matthews and proceeded to pull away.

Abbie Scott scored her first England try just before half-time and Italy found themselves under even more pressure when Beatrice Rigonni was sin-binned.

Ceri Large was next to cross the try line and England added gloss to the scoreline with late tries from former captain Katy Mclean, Hannah Gallagher and Kay Wilson.

Acting interim head coach Nicky Ponsford said: 'This week we asked for a step up and that is what we got.

'It was a far more positive performance. While we made life a little bit difficult for ourselves, we dominated the game and possession. There are a lot more things to put right but we are definitely moving in the right direction.' 

Abbie Scott is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring her first try for her country
