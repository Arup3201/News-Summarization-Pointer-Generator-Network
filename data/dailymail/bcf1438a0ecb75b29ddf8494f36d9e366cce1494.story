Neymar has undergone a transformation in the past year from a scrawny show pony to a goal machine, and Spanish newspaper Sport says the Brazilian has become 'stronger' and 'more prolific'.

The forward did not score in his first six games for Barcelona after joining last summer, but has nine goals in as many Barca matches this season, including the second in the Catalans' 3-0 win against Eibar on Saturday.

Sport has also quoted Luis Suarez saying that he cried when he heard Barcelona wanted to sign him. The controversial former Liverpool striker is set to make his debut against Real Madrid in Saturday's Clasico.

The Spanish papers are already looking forward to Saturday's Clasico between Real Madrid and Barca

Mundo Deportivo has focused on  Lionel Messi, and the fact that his last Champions League hat-trick was against Ajax, and his last La Liga treble was against Real Madrid - the two sides are the Spanish giants' next two opponents.

In Italy meanwhile, La Gazetta dello Sport claims Mario Balotelli, is 'not having fun' at Liverpool after the striker's  woeful performance in the Reds' 3-2 win against QPR on Sunday.

The Italian papers have mainly focused on Sunday evening's 2-2 draw between Inter and Napoli where Hernanes' equaliser in stoppage time salvaged a point for the Milan outfit. 

Inter's city rivals Milan moved up to fourth on Sunday, as a brace from Keisuke Honda secured a 3-1 win away at Verona.

In France, Marseille have been grabbing the headlines after their 2-0 win against Toulouse kept them seven points clear at the top of Ligue 1. 

The win was the eighth in a row for Marcelo Bielsa's side and prompted L'Equipe to ask whether the team have 'the faces of champions'?
