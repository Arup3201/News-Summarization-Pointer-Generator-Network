Team Sky took a one-two on the fourth stage of Paris-Nice as Richie Porte crossed the line just ahead of Geraint Thomas.

The British team showed their strength on the final climb of the Croix de Chaubouret and the pair punched the air after both making valuable moves towards the yellow jersey.

The pack had already thinned out considerably when Welshman Thomas made his big move with three kilometres to go of the longest stage of the race.

It was a Team Sky one-two on the fourth stage of Paris-Nice secured by Richie Porte and Geraint Thomas

Australian Porte then kicked away one kilometre from the finish and it was only Thomas who was able to go with him.

Michal Kwiatkowski was third, eight seconds adrift, and that was enough for the Pole to reclaim the overall race lead by a single second, with Porte now next in line and Thomas another two seconds behind in third.

Porte, the race winner in 2013, told the Team Sky website: 'That was a great performance from the team. We took it on from the bottom of that last climb. It wasn't easy on there, so to finish first and second is fantastic.

Porte celebrates on the podium after winning the fourth stage, and he is now eyeing another overall win

'We've got two more hard days coming up now and then a time trial on the Col d'Eze. I love that climb and I'd love to have a good ride there. I'm in a good position and having such a strong team here will definitely help.

'With Geraint and I up there on the general classification now, it's good to have two cards to play. The dream is to hold the yellow jersey on Sunday evening. I love this race and I'd love to win it again.'

Porte (centre) said the success of himself and Jones gave Sky 'two cards to play' as the race goes on
