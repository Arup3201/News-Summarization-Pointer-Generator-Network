Bolton are prepared to take a gamble on Nick Powell that they hope will pay off with a return to the Barclays Premier League.

The 20-year-old Manchester United forward will have his loan spell at Leicester City cut short having made just three substitute appearances and the Foxes losing each game.

Powell has long been hailed as one of England’s great hopes but his attitude has been brought into question over recent seasons by coaches at United, Wigan and now Leicester.

Nick Powell has struggled to make an impact at Leicester after joining on loan from Manchester United

The 20-year-old has played just three times since joining in the summer, and his loan will be terminated

Bolton manager Neil Lennon is up for the challenge of turning round one of the country’s most talented prospects but he will be wondering which Powell will turn up.

A star made in Crewe with the world at his feet, he announced his arrival with a thunderbolt goal in the 2-0 victory over Cheltenham Town in the 2012 League Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium.

It secured Crewe’s promotion to League One and helped convince Sir Alex Ferguson to sign him for United in a deal worth £6m. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce bemoaned how United’s financial muscle had blown them out of the water.

Powell scored on his United debut against Wigan and seemed tuned in to the task ahead.

‘It was great to make my debut,’ he said after that game. ‘To then cap it off with a goal is what I’ve been working for.

During his loan at Wigan the young midfielder scored 12 goals, but his attitude was called into question

'Dario (Gradi, Crewe’s director of football) used to say my game isn’t just attacking and defending, it’s about goals as well and I proved that last season and hopefully I can do that for United. 

'My dad will keep me in touch, I’ll tell you that. I’m just going to go home, have this great feeling and I’ll keep myself on the ground. When I first came on it scared me a little bit, to be fair, because I’m only used to 5,000 people now and then, but it’s a great atmosphere – the fans are great. 

'It wasn’t the hardest game because they made it easier for me but I’m happy to be on the pitch getting minutes. 

'I learn every day, especially from the midfielders – Scholes, Carrick, Giggsy – they’re all great, they’ve all been through it and won trophies. That’s what I want to do, so I hope to learn off them every day.’

Powell is sometimes criticised for his laid-back attitude, to the point at which some have called him idle

The midfielder still has plenty of talent, and has played at the highest level, including the Champions League

He remained, understandably for his tender years, a peripheral figure and was loaned out to Wigan the following season.

A 12-goal haul showed his loan was a success but it was not without the input of coach Owen Coyle. His successor Uwe Rosler struggled to draw the same impact.

‘He’s got the talent but he just looks as if he’s not interested,’ said one coach. ‘He constantly needs pushing and you tell him some things and it seems to go over his head. It’s as if football is his hobby not his profession.’

United staff talk of needing to supervise him in the gym and a laidback style that borders on idleness.

‘Hopefully this will make him realise what he needs to do,’ said the coach. ‘But you get the feeling he’d be happy going back to Crewe.’
