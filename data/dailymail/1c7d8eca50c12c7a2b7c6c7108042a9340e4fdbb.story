The married teacher accused of raping a 14-year-old student over a seven-month period was friends with countless teen boys and girls on Facebook, it emerged today.

Sixth-grade English teacher Daniel Reilly, 36, from Queens, New York, is accused of having sex repeatedly with the student at his home while his wife and new baby daughter were out.

On his Facebook page - which has since been taken down - he had 40 visible friends, the majority of whom were young students from local high schools.

The ex-marine had his victim use a code name in her cellphone to keep the illegal hookups a secret, according to the Queens district attorney.

His lawyer wife, Annemarie, put up his $30,000 bail Tuesday, said Reilly’s lawyer, Eric Franz, and is 'supporting her husband'.

If convicted, he faces seven years in prison.

Court documents suggested that their most recent tryst took just days before Reilly was arrested at Intermediate School 237 in Flushing after his alleged victim's mother alerted the school.

The prosecutor told Queens Criminal Court that the alleged relationship began last year after he pursued the girl, who originally just wanted to be friends with him.

He is alleged to have begun texting her last August before inviting her to his apartment when his wife and 11-month-old daughter were out.

Reilly, who faces statutory rape charges, is said to have given the girl a code-name to use so that her parents would not discover the affair, while he used another code for her so his wife Annemarie would remain in the dark.

The prosecutor said: 'The defendant planned on keeping the affair secret', according to a report in the New York Daily News.

It said the relationship was only discovered when the victim's sister discovered texts from Reilly on her sister's cellphone.

She told her parents, who alerted IS237, where the girl is no longer a student, and they hauled him out of class while they rang police.

The $61,000-a-year teacher, who served as a sergeant in the Marines between 1996-2000, is said to have no history of disciplinary problems since he began working as a teacher in 2007.

Queens DA Richard Brown told the New York Post: 'This case is particularly disturbing.  Schools should be safe havens for children.

'Instead, this defendant is accused of sexually preying upon one of his former students and rendezvousing with her at his residence.'

Schools chancellor Dennis Walcott said: 'As I've said before, this is totally unacceptable.  We have no tolerance for that.

'Keep your hands off our students.'

Reilly is said to have been honorably discharged from the Marines in 2000, and is a popular teacher at the school where he has taught for six years.

He is charged with second-degree rape, criminal sexual acts, and endangering the welfare of a child, and is due back in court on May 6.  A victim order has been issued on behalf of the teen.
