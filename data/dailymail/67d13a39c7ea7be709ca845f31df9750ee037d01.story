A driver has racked up Britain's biggest ever parking fine after being slapped with a £14,000 bill for leaving his car in disabled bays with abusive messages on the windscreen.

David Lee, 37, ignored 140 tickets in one year after parking his Ford Mondeo across disabled bays in dozens of private car parks across Lincoln.

He has already been served with four county court judgements totalling more than £3,000 by Leeds-based firm UK Car Parking Solutions (UKCPS).

David Lee, 37, from Lincolnshire,  ignored more than 140 parking tickets in one year and faces a £14,000 fine

And the firm intends to issue a further £10,000 worth of charges before the courts, as well as an estimated £1,000 in costs.

His total bill is higher than that racked up by footballer Mario Balotelli, who was hit with nearly £10,000 in parking fines when he played for Manchester City in 2011.

Mr Lee's Ford Mondeo was often ticketed for being parked across disabled bays as well as being carelessly left across multiple spots.

He  left unpaid and damaged parking tickets on the car's dashboard - with a notice labelling the Leeds firm 'UK Car Park Scammers'.

He also wrote a note claiming the charges were unenforceable. 

Speaking outside his £100,000 semi-detached house in Scampton, near Lincoln, Mr Lee said: 'I am very embarrassed about all this.' 

Steve Hall, UKCPS legal manager, said: 'This is one of the highest parking charge debts to be served on a single motorist in the UK for parking on private land.

'Four of the undefended county court judgements amount to £3,265, with an additional £10,000 still to be issued.

'The vehicle was often parked across more than one bay. On many occasions, the charges were for parking out of marked bays and without authority.

'The vehicle dashboard was clearly visible for all passing people to see, scattered with unpaid parking tickets.

'UKCPS have had letters returned to us by Mr Lee after being cut up into small pieces.

'Staff have reconstructed the relevant section of the pages to discover the parking charge numbers referred back to the vehicle.'

Mr Lee, who lives in Scampton, Lincolnshire, attended Lincoln County Court earlier this month.

But UKCPS said they have not received any money from the driver.

A spokeswoman for the British Parking Association said: 'UKCPS are a member of our organisation and operate under our code of practice.

'They have every right to take people to court.'
