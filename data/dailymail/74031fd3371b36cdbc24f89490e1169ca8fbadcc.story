Jack Wilshere is confident he will be fit and ready for Saturday’s game at Aston Villa after tests on the ankle he twisted against Borussia Dortmund.

Wilshere has not done any serious damage and hopes to be back in training in time to prove his fitness for Villa Park. He did not train on Wednesday but insisted he was “fine”.

Arsene Wenger said after the match that he was concerned, fearing complications because it was the right ankle, the same joint injured in 2011 when he did not play for 17 months.

Wilshere had lengthy treatment on the pitch in the closing minutes of the 2-0 defeat in Germany but hobbled through to the end because Arsenal had already used their three substitutes.

Wenger could still use the opportunity to rest the England international after an intense spell for club and country but the 22-year-old will not want to miss out after playing well against Manchester City last weekend.

Mathieu Debuchy, who suffered ankle ligament damage against City, will see another specialist on Friday. Debuchy wrote on Facebook: ‘No fracture but one broken ligament... I have to wait until Friday in order to know if i must have surgery...’
