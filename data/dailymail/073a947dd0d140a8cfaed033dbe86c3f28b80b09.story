A young man's footage of being bitten by a black snake as he calmly stands still has gone viral on social media.

You grow up being told to keep not to move if you are unfortunate enough to come across snake and they will leave you alone - but for one guy this age-old trick didn't quite go to plan.

Jono Roberts, from Forbes in central west NSW, posted a video on his Facebook page of a one-and-a-half metre snake slithering towards him, when he was only wearing thongs, before it strikes out at his right foot.

Scroll down for video 

The video shows the snake slowly approaching Jono as is he calmly stands in the middle of the road

The snake winds around Jono's right ankle before suddenly striking out at him

Jono offered wise words of wisdom when he posted the footage by pointing out that standing still when encountering a snake is not always a sure bet.

'Tried the old stand still trick. Always show respect and never get too complacent,' Jono commented.

The video shows the snake slowly approaches Jono, who is standing in the middle of the road, and winds around his right ankle before suddenly biting him.

Jono was so shocked (and probably in pain) that he kicked the scaly reptile about a metre away as he exclaims 'f***!' as his thong then fell off his foot onto the ground.

The footage has gone nuts online with more than 3,000 views and almost 5,500 shares.

There has been a mixed reaction from social media users with some really impressed with the video.

Andrew Robbo Robinson described it as: 'This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life.'

While Luke Braid posted: 'sweet footage mate'.

Jono Roberts seems to have a love of all kinds of animals - all things large and small

And others hailed Jono as a hero 

'Hectic as!!!!!! You're a legend bro!!!!' James Smith said.

'Mate this video has 3000 views. Your hectic and famous!' James Bondy commented. 

Others comments on the insanity of even thinking to film such a scary moment as he was also described as 'crazy', a 'nutter' and a 'loose unit'. 

While Jason Craig Steward pointed out that how Jono experienced a lucky escape.

'Your (sic) a special guy Jono that didn't look like a warning bite he definitely droped a few mls in you.'

Jono has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that he is fine after the incident.
