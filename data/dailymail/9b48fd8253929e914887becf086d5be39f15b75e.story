Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs' brother has spoken out for the first time about the affair that destroyed his marriage and rocked the world of football.

It was a national scandal when Ryan's' eight-year affair with his brother Rhodri's wife hit the headlines in 2011.

The ex-Welsh international had taken out a super-injunction  to prevent the scandal being revealed, and even took legal action against Twitter users, before the story finally broke.

Now Rhodri has revealed how Ryan's shocking act of betrayal blew apart his marriage and left him picking up the pieces more than three years later.

The younger brother of the Manchester United assistant manager has told his story for the first time ever on television on new Channel Five Series He Left Me For My Mother and Other Betrayals.

And he revealed he had never even received an apology from Ryan.

'I haven't spoken to him since it happened,' Rhodri told Wales Online. 

'I don't care about an apology I just want to get on with my life. That cloud will be over his head, and her head. My conscience is very clear.'

The affair was even more shocking as they pair had been inseperable as children and Rhodri said he had 'worshipped the ground' Ryan walked on.

Their relationship only began to change when their father Danny Wilson, who played rugby union and league for Wales, walked out on them.

The story of Ryan and Natasha's relationship broke after Welsh model and Big Brother contestant, Imogen Thomas, spoke out about her liaisons with the now Manchester United assistant manager.

Rhodri only discovered the torrid affair when he read it in the newspaper- brought over by his mother-in-law.

'Natasha had done a disappearing act one day, I'd been playing football at Old Trafford, came home and fallen asleep early and woke up at 3am and she wasn't home.

'At 6am her mum knocked on the door with a paper and a letter. That's how I found out, from reading the News of The World with her mum sitting next to me.

Ryan and Stacey have stayed together through the scandal unlike his brother Rhodri and Natasha, who separated after she appeared in Celebrity Big Brother

Despite the public humiliation, Ryan's wife Stacey Cooke has remained with her husband and their two children

'I phoned him saying 'Is it true?' but he denied it. I didn't know what to believe.

'You've got two people here you supposedly trust, and you want to believe both of them.'

But Natasha showed him proof of the affair in a collection of text messages and pictures sent by Ryan.

The football pro later told Rhodri the eight-year relationship with his wife had been 'just sex' and had meant nothing. 'He'd demolished my family over sex,' he added.

Rhodri, who is also a  footballer and plays part time for FC United of Manchester, had attempted to keep his family together after the scandal but said his marriage had crumbled.

'I wanted to keep my family together because what destroyed me, what made me so angry in my life is when my father left,' he added. 'And I didn't want that with my kids.

'It was difficult, I did want to stay in that family, but it just wasn't going to work.'   

After a difficult few years which included a stint in jail, Rhodri met Natasha and they wed in 2010 in a Las Vegas reception.

Natasha later filed for divorce after she appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2013.

She gave birth to a little boy, her third son, last April, with new partner Mike Smith. 

He Left Me For My Mother and Other Betrayals is on January 14 at 8pm on Channel Five.
