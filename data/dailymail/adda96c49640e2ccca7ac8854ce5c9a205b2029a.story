Michele Bachmann’s former high school is under fire for a spate of suicides by gay and lesbian students that allegedly followed anti-homosexual school policy.

A recent Rolling Stone article details the rampant homophobia in the Anoka-Hennepin School District- from which Ms Bachmann graduated- and how school administrators encouraged teachers to steer clear of conversations about sexuality with students.

The issue has come to light after a scary amount of teen suicides- nine in the past two years- have occurred in the school district, many of whom were either homosexual or thought to be by their peers.

Rising star: Michele Bachmann, who ran a failed bid for the presidency, is known for her ultra-conservative religious views that interpret homosexuality very harshly

Many more have attempted to take their own lives leading state public health officials to slap a 'suicide contagion area' label on the region because of the high levels.

While Michele Bachmann rose to the national political stage last year because of her failed bid for the presidency, another anti-homosexual campaigner named Barb Anderson has taken charge of the ultra-conservative agenda in the area's schools.

Ms Anderson is the one who first introduced and authored the so-called 'No Homo Promo' policy which told teachers in the district to avoid any talk of homosexuality within the schools. 

The idea that homosexuality is 'wrong' and the belief that it is a 'sinful choice' is something that essentially became a school rule as students perceived their teacher's silence as a admission of fault and blame.

in 2010

'They're made to feel ashamed of who they are. They're bullied. And there's no one to stand up for them, because teachers are afraid of being fired,' Anoka Middle School for the Arts teacher Jefferson Fietek told Rolling Stone. 

'LGBTQ students don't feel safe at school,' he continued.

At least four of those who committed suicide were openly gay or, at least, perceived to be gay by classmates, and many were reportedly bullied. 

Anoka High School in Minnesota, which is the alma mater of Michele Bachmann, is at the heart of a anti-gay-bullying debate because of their discriminatory policies

While it is impossible to prove why 
these youngsters took their own lives, many are drawing a link between 
their bullying and the anti-gay rhetoric sweeping through school 
districts in the state.

One 
of the most publicized cases was that of Justin Aaberg, an openly gay 15
year old who hanged himself weeks after finishing his freshman year at 
Anoka High School.

His suicide was the school district's sixth in a year's time.

Since his death, Justin's 
mother Tammy has been spoken publicly about the worry she had for her son's 
safety as an openly gay teen and battled to get the school district to 
change its thinking on anti-gay bullying.

Pact: Minnesota school girls from a different 
district, Haylee Fentress, left, and Paige Moravetz, right, carried out a
suicide pact in April because they said they were being bullied

Waste: Lance Lundsten, a Jefferson High School 
student, left,  who was openly gay on his Facebook page, took an 
overdose and later died in hospital in March, while Thomas John 'TJ' 
Hayes, right, committed suicide in 2009

Tragic: The latest case in the district was of 14-year-old Jordan Yenor (left) who killed himself in May 2011, and he was preceded by Aaron Jurek, (right), a student at Blaine High School who died in 2009

The original article, One Town's War on Gay Teens, can be read in this week's issue of Rolling Stone magazine

She also delivered a petition with over 140,000 signatures to Bachmann demanding she denounce the gay-bullying that was common in the area. She never directly received a response but heard through the grapevine that Bachmann responded vaguely, saying 'bullying is wrong' and 'all human lives have undeniable value' but never directly mentioning homosexuality. 

Anoka-Hennepin is currently under federal investigation for infringing civil rights because it refused to add lessons promoting homosexuality to the curriculum.

Several
LGBT students are also suing the district claiming to have been ignored by 
staff after complaining of being harassed physically and verbally for 
long periods of time.

One 
of the plaintiffs dropped out of school, later attempting suicide while 
another claims to have been called a 'faggot' in the hallway while a 
teacher who witnessed the attack did nothing, according to the suit.

School employees could not teach that
homosexuality was a 'normal, valid lifestyle.' The policy was later 
changed to require staff to remain neutral on the subject, but only if 
it should come up in class.

Teachers were instructed to say that, if they witnessed verbal bullying of a student perceived to be gay, 'In this school we are required to welcome all people and to make them feel safe' but they were told not to show 'personal support for GLBT people'.

Both
policies were influenced by two religious groups - and big Bachmann 
supporters -  the Minnesota Family Council (MFC) and The Parents Action 
League, which also lobbied to put discredited 'reparative therapy' 
materials into schools, according to the website.
