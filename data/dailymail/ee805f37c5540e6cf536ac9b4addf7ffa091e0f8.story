The wife of disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir is demanding a divorce from her criminal husband, who she loyally supported throughout his fraud trial.

Throughout his trial, the 71-year-old's wife Nur faithfully attended the court case every day and when he was sentenced declared he was a 'genius' and 'innocent'.

But now the glamourous 29-year-old wants 
to end the marriage to her husband, who lavished her with expensive 
gifts, The Times reported.

Former Polly Peck chief executive Asil Nadir was accompanied by his wife Nur throughout his trial at the Old Bailey

The 29-year-old was a constant supporter of her crook husband, and stayed by his side

Stuck by him: When convicted, a defiant Mrs Nadir said: 'My husband is a business genius'

The criminal is currently serving a 
ten-year sentence in Belmarsh Prison, near Woolwich, southeast London, 
for fraud and the theft of more than £30million from his former Polly 
Peck empire.

The pair met when Kuwait-born Mrs Nadir went to work in Nadir's media company after graduating from a North Cyprus university, but he proposed within months.

The couple married in Northern Cyprus when she was 21 - 43 years younger than the balding multimillionaire - and led an idyllic life in their luxurious seaside mansion.

Turkish-Cypriot Nadir fled the country in 1993, less than three years after Polly Peck collapsed, losing investors millions.

He
lived in exile in northern Cyprus for 17 years before he returned to 
Britain in 2010 to 'clear his name', where he lived a life of luxury 
despite insisting he was 'penniless'. 

Nur was bought a brand-new £70,000 Range Rover Vogue with the personalised number plate AN02NUR - standing for 'Asil Nadir love to Nur'

The 29-year-old allegedly wants to end the marriage to her husband, who lavished her with expensive gifts, according to The Times

After the sentence Nur Nadil said: 'My husband is a business genius.

'It is important to note that Asil Nadir came from great wealth as a direct result of his and his family's working morals and ethics.

'The image that has been portrayed of him as someone who solely lived off the benefits of Polly Peck is a great prejudice.

'He is a man of great character, integrity and honour that gave in abundance to charity for many years.

'My husband is innocent and having put our faith in the British justice system we will continue in our efforts to rectify the wrongs.

'I would like to thank the public for their continued support.'

He
and wife Nur rented a £21,000-a-month Mayfair house, with at least five
staff, and were driven around the city by chauffeurs on shopping trips 
to exclusive boutiques and Harrods.

Nur was bought a brand-new £70,000 Range Rover Vogue with the personalised number plate AN02NUR – standing for 'Asil Nadir love to Nur'.

Mrs Nadir spent her days shopping in Bond Street's designer stores and riding horses.

The 29-year-old was a constant supporter of her crook husband, and stayed by his side throughout the trial last August.

The judge even allowed the court to adjourn for a day when she was taken to hospital after falling from her horse in Hyde Park in to allow Nadir to go to her bedside.

Nadir was convicted of 10 counts of theft from PPI between 1987 and 1990.

He was discharged from bankruptcy after being convicted of theft and fraud  - where his defence in a £1million legal bill was paid for by legal aid.

He later paid £5million in compensation to investors after being warned he would serve another six years if he refused.

At his seven-month trial, Nadir tried to maintain he was the victim of a 'dirty tricks' set up by the Metropolitan Police and the Serious Fraud Office.

When convicted, a defiant Mrs Nadir said: 'My husband is a business genius.

'The image that has been portrayed of him as someone who solely lived off the benefits of Polly Peck is a great prejudice.

'He is a man of great character, integrity and honour that gave in abundance to charity for many years.'
