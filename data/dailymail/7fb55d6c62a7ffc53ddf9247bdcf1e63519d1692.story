Prince William’s favourite cocktail has been recreated at a fraction of the usual £135 cost - by budget supermarket Aldi.

The store is sending a selection of ingredients to Kensington Palace which will enable William to serve the ‘Aldiki’ for a mere £3.23 per person.

It is a version of the famous Mahiki Treasure Chest which is enjoyed by royals, actors and musicians alike at trendy London bar, Mahiki.

Raising the bar: Mahiki in Mayfair, a favourite of Prince William, makes the £135 Treasure Chest cocktail that inspired Aldi's gift

Costing just £25.80 for eight people, the Aldiki is an exotic mix of rum, brandy, peach schnapps and fruit juice from the supermarket’s drinks range. It is topped off with a celebratory bottle of sparkling wine.

Expert mixologist and cocktail guru Michael Stringer, who created the Aldiki for Aldi, has created a video demonstrating how to create the drink at home, just in time for the Prince’s 30th tomorrow.

Michael said: 'Mahiki’s Treasure Chest is deservedly a world-famous drink, but for anyone on a tighter budget, the Aldiki is a great alternative'.

'The Aldiki is a refreshing and theatrical cocktail perfect for a right royal celebration - and it proves you don’t need a regal budget to party like a prince.'

The supermarket will send the Aldiki ingredients to Kensington Palace tomorrow, to congratulate the Prince on reaching his milestone.

An Aldi spokesperson added: 'We wanted to help our customers celebrate this special date in a fun but affordable way. What could be more fitting than raising a glass to the Prince in the style that he enjoys most - but at just a fraction of the price.'

'We’re hoping the Aldiki might even receive the royal seal of approval from Kensington Palace.'
