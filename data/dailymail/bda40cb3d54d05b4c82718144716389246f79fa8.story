A charity worker has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work.

George Maccoy also claimed to have completed 25 years in the RAF, but documentation suggested he had only completed 16 days before buying himself out without completing his basic training.

He was employed as a ‘meeter and greeter’ at Corporation of Trinity House, a 500-year-old charity based in Newcastle which helps to care for mariners and their dependents.

Disgraceful: George Maccoy, 60, has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work

While he was employed, he claimed he had testicular cancer and forged letters from an imaginary consultant to justify taking time off work for fictitious hospital appointments.

The charity had sacked the 60-year-old for nine counts of gross misconduct which included running-up up a 'considerable bill' by calling a dating agency on the handyman’s phone, the tribunal was told.

But Mr Maccoy claimed he had been unfairly dismissed when the breakdown of a relationship triggered an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder which his managers failed to deal with.

But his case was withdrawn and the tribunal was shown paperwork stating the 60-year-old served just 16 days in the RAF in 1979 without having completed his basic training.

And in a rare move by the tribunal panel, Mr Maccoy was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs after a second claim for disability discrimination was withdrawn in June this year.

Mr Maccoy was employed by Master, Pilots and Seamen of the Corporation of Trinity House, where he worked as a 'meeter and greeter' attending to VIPs and guests at the charity’s functions.

But the organisation, which helps support poor mariners as well as examining and licensing deep sea shipping pilots, dismissed him in May last year after it was discovered that he had lied about suffering from cancer.

Mr Maccoy had used a work printer to write letters from medical experts in which he lied about suffering from testicular cancer, the tribunal was told.

He lost his £8-an-hour job after colleagues discovered the forged letter from fictitious consultant oncologist Simon Carter, a character created by Mr Maccoy to justify taking time off work to attend appointments, it was said.

In February Mr Maccoy - who has spoken publicly about his battle to deal with the demons of war - launched a damages claim for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination.

But a legal team from Eversheds, led by senior associate Stephen Cairns, refuted the claims and in April they produced a letter from the RAF which said Mr Maccoy enlisted on March 21, 1972, but bought himself out just 16 days later on April 6.

It is unclear if Mr Maccoy subsequently served in other parts of the armed forces or whether he saw action on foreign soil. It is believed that he was a member of the Territorial Army at some point.

But Mr Cairns produced evidence at the tribunal which suggested Mr Maccoy had been working in South Tyneside as a caretaker during the 1990s when he claimed to be a serving aircraftsman.

A spokeswoman for Trinity House said: 'The Newcastle Trinity House is pleased with the outcome of this employment tribunal which makes clear that all Mr Maccoy’s claims were completely untrue.

'We are, however, both deeply shocked and saddened that Mr Maccoy invented a past history with the RAF and moreover that he chose to fabricate post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of combat experience.

'We feel such deception is not only disturbing but also demeaning to all those genuine victims from our armed forces.'

Mr Maccoy refused to comment following the tribunal but in a claim submitted to the tribunal, Mr Maccoy said: 'I was dismissed from my employment for alleged gross misconduct.

'At that time and presently I was/am suffering severe depression, also severe PTSD causing me to suffer loss of intellectual and social functions, whilst striving to hold down full-time employment.'
