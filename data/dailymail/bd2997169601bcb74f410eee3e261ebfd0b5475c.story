Former England defender Sol Campbell believes his fellow black players are 'too scared' to speak out about racism.

The 39-year-old, who retired two years ago after playing for Tottenham, Arsenal, Portsmouth, Notts County and Newcastle, claimed in March he could have been England captain for 10 years had he been white.

Campbell admits he has been disappointed by the reaction of several black ex-professionals, accusing them of being 'too scared to own up' to the fact they have been victims of - or witnessed - racial abuse.

'They are seeing what is happening around them and they don't do anything about it. They love the status quo. They just want to toe the line,' he told the Daily Mirror.

'It's a case of, "I'm all right, I don't care who is coming up behind me. I'm too scared to own up". Well, I'm not like that and I am never going to be like that, I'm just going to be me.

'People could have said what they did in a different way. John Barnes had bananas thrown at him. He is almost acting like nothing happened to him. People like him could have said, "Maybe not 10 years, but I could see where he was coming from. Articulate it in a different way".'

Ex-Manchester United and Liverpool midfielder Paul Ince, who captained England seven times during the 1990s, was one such prominent former international team-mate of Campbell's who rejected his claims, saying the defender 'wouldn't have been England captain for 10 years - nobody is'.

Referring to the newspaper interview in question, Campbell added: 'Then you've got Paul Ince in the Daily Mail. It's like "Really?". What position are you protecting when your position can so easily be taken away?

'I know some of the political people are trying to kind of move the FA in certain ways.

'But you just get to the stage where, if I've got black ex-players going against me then you start to think, "What is going on here?". I'll just let people drift and carry on doing my own thing.'
