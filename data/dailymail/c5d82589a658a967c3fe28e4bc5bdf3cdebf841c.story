Saturday is the day when love of math and a hankering for pastry come full circle. Saturday is Pi Day, a once-in-a-year calendar date that this time squares the fun with a once-in-a-century twist.

Math nerds all over the world will be celebrating with pizza specials, romantic outings, and mathtastic special events.

Saturday is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653.

The best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds, morning and evening. The next time that happens is in March 2115.

'It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics,' said University of California Berkeley mathematician and author Edward Frenkel. 

'Pi is special.'

Pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics. It 'is kind of a basic atomic building block" for math, said Temple University mathematician and author John Paulos, who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m.

In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie.

'It's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm,' said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University math professor, who called it a time for people to 'remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school.'

Kaplan acknowledged that most people don't really recall math as fun, blaming that on how it's taught: 'There's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world.'

One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns. Yet in 1897, a bill before the Indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2. It fell flat.

'We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time,' Frenkel said. 

'How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?'

The wall Street Journal reports that Dana Emanuel and Byron Clarke decided to hold their wedding on the special day.

The date won't come around again for 100 years, so the couple decided  to send circular wedding invitations to  family and friends. 

The nuptials are even in unison which their engagement date on June 28 last year — 6.28, or two pi.

'The guests are really getting into and are able to laugh about it,' said Clarke. 

'It kind of plays into our personalities and humor will hopefully be a big part of the day.'

Baked goods: Hanover High School students participate in Pi Day activities in 2012 and made this tasty and dorktastic creation 

Nice crust!: To celebrate Pi day (the math constant and March 14 or 3-14), Wanda's Pie in the Sky also made this baked good several years ago 

'Our friends are wacky like we are,' joked Emanuel.

Pie even coincides with some of the couple's earliest dating memories, reports The New York Daily News.

'We won a dessert-making competition at a fundraiser for Blue Sky Bakery in October 2013 — and the prize was two pies! Which, when written mathematically, is 6.28…' the couple writes on their wedding website.

In New York, Chicago, and other culinary states will be offering pizza deals on their 'pies.'

Students at schools across the country are celebrating with baked goods and fun events.
