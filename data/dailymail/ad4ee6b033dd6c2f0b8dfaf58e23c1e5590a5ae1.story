For all its wealth and influence, football suffers from a host of self-made problems. Yet the national game offers many more reasons to celebrate than to curse. Which is something to remember when we contemplate the misadventures of the bewildered clown named Dave Whelan.

By now, we can almost recite his odious stereotyping: ‘Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do?... It’s telling the truth. Jewish people love money... If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a chink he is lying... There’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to. I would never even dream of that... I go to Barbados a lot.’

It is the kind of grotesque drivel which renders satire redundant. And it faithfully echoes the attitudes of the man whom Whelan appointed to manage Wigan Athletic. For by now we have become wretchedly acquainted with the musings of Malky Mackay.

Dave Whelan (right) and new Wigan boss Malky Mackay are of one mind

On a South Korean footballer: ‘*** chinkys. ** it. There’s enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.’

On the football agent Phil Smith: ‘Go on, fat Phil. Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers.’

On a football official: ‘He’s a snake, a gay snake. Not to be trusted.’

On a female agent: ‘I hope she’s looking after your needs. I bet you’d love a bounce on her falsies.’

All this, plus the distribution of a picture entitled ‘Black Monopoly’, with every square marked ‘Go To Jail’.

The episode has erupted at a turbulent time, when the game is distracted by issues ranging from FIFA corruption, to Ched Evans, to the re-emergence of a hard-right strand among England supporters. And it embodies the attitude which insists that football is entitled to live by its own standards, regardless of the views of the outside world.

Thus, Mackay can send messages to a chum at another club, in the knowledge that they hold common assumptions about Jews, foreigners, women and gays. The fact that non-football people might find such views grossly offensive has clearly never crossed his mind. You see, we’re all lads together here. Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, quality banter. 

Yet this is the character Whelan chose to manage his club, on the extraordinary grounds that ‘what he’s done is so tiny, really... It’s not all that serious when you read it.’ And he awarded him the job in the full knowledge that the FA were inquiring into Mackay’s behaviour.

Mackay patrols the touchline on his return to football, despite being under investigation from the FA

Imagine somebody applying for a post as the manager of one of Whelan’s sports shops and admitting that the authorities were still inquiring into his previous conduct. Would Whelan say: ‘Not a problem, son. Come right in. The job’s yours.’? Of course not. But he can do precisely that at Wigan, because it doesn’t really count. It’s only football.

Crystal Palace behaved quite differently. They were in the process of offering Mackay a position at Selhurst Park, but negotiations were swiftly broken off when the sexist, racist, homophobic revelations appeared. Are the people who run Palace more principled than those who run Wigan? It would seem so.

Football’s freemasonry being what it is, both Whelan and Mackay found support within the game. One Premier League manager declared Whelan ‘a good man’, and said of Mackay: ‘It’s easy to kick someone when they’re down... If he does it again, he’s gonna be in trouble, but I’m sure he’s learned from that. He’s made a big mistake, the lad.’ If Harry Redknapp is the best advocate Whelan and Mackay can find, then their cause may well be hopeless.

Mackay still seems incapable of appreciating the offence he has given. ‘I’m a big man,’ he said, as he took up his new job. ‘I would ask people to judge me as they see me. I made mistakes but I’m absolutely not racist. I hope going forward the people of Wigan see me as I am.’

The people of Wigan may do just that, and he may not care for their conclusions. As for Whelan, he simply blunders on; a contemptible figure whose image degenerates each time he opens his mouth. Some have tried to excuse him on the grounds that he is an old man who comes from a different, more bigoted era. But he has been talking offensive nonsense for a number of years now, and he shows no signs of changing.

He clearly doesn’t believe that Mackay has done anything particularly untoward, and in Whelan’s world, he probably hasn’t. For this is football, where such attitudes are condoned and tolerated, sometimes even celebrated.

Yet, by the week’s end, even Whelan seemed to tire of his own prattling. He is aware of the FA investigations into the affair, but he affects an airy indifference. ‘I don’t think there is anything really to investigate’, he says. ‘I just want to get on with the great game.’

The FA may have other ideas; if so, they would be widely supported. For the football people of Wigan deserve rather better than Dave Whelan and Malky Mackay. And so does the national sport.

Ched posturing absurd 

Many are split over Ched Evans' future

Some believe that the rapist Ched Evans should once again be allowed to train with his club.

Others, this column included, contend his offence was so grave that he should find no immediate place in professional sport.

Both arguments have much to commend them but people must adopt one or the other, or risk appearing ridiculous.

Which brings us to Jim Phipps, the co-chairman of Sheffield United.

Speaking after his club had withdrawn training facilities from Evans, he said: ‘I’m angry that we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done. The influence of mob-like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing Ched to train. Ched was convicted and has served his sentence.

‘He now has a right and an obligation to go about making a livelihood.’

All of which is admirably high-sounding and thoroughly misleading.

Evans has served only the custodial portion of his five-year sentence. He is now paroled under licence conditions. But if Sheffield United wanted him to resume training and ultimately playing, then they would be entitled to make that judgement. And if they recognise his ‘right and obligation’ to resume his livelihood, they have only to say the word.

The fact is, they are afraid to take those steps because they know they will prove unpopular. And so their co-chairman pretends they had no choice. It is absurd. Few people can claim credit from the Evans affair. After the posturing of Phipps, Sheffield United can claim less than most.

Silence is sweet music

In a good few years of watching sport, I have yet to meet a fan who bought a ticket to look at the audience.

When people pay for a sports event, they do so in order to observe the players. This simple truth is something which escapes certain groups: cricket’s so-called Barmy Army, for instance, or that dreadful band whose dreary thumping forms the background to far too many England football matches.

Certain English cricket grounds have evolved ways of dealing with the attention-seeking ‘Barmies’, by refusing entry on the grounds that they make life hell for anybody within hearing distance.

Yet at least their songs are largely inoffensive. The characters who have latched on to English football’s band are a different matter.

Personally, I have always believed that anybody who turns up carrying a musical instrument should be turned away. This would deny us endless, artless repetitions of the national anthem, or Jerusalem or, God help us, The Great Escape. But we could live with that. For it would also deny some unsavoury individuals the chance to infect sport with crass slogans, by bawling anti-IRA chants and singing provocative songs.

In Glasgow the other evening, an FA official was obliged to ask the band to stop playing, since their ‘music’ was unwittingly fuelling certain sectarian anthems. They instantly complied and the silence was golden. With luck, it will never be broken.

PS

The New Zealand haka — the pre-match war dance performed by the All Blacks — was one of those strangely endearing cultural traditions which was always watched with respect by opponents and spectators. Then we were told that somehow it gave New Zealand an unfair advantage. 

At the recent Twickenham international, the home crowd drowned the haka with wave after boorish wave of Sweet Chariot. So it was good to hear the Wales wing George North speak up for tradition before Saturday’s international.

Richie McCaw leads the New Zealand players as they perform the haka at the Millennium Stadium 

‘I can’t wait to face the haka again,’ he said. ‘It’s supposed to be intimidating, but if you can’t handle it, then you’re probably not going to be able to manage a game of international rugby either’. 

Absolutely. Long may it continue.
