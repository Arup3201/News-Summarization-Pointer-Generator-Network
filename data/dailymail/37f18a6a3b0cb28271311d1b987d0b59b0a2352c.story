For desperate Chinese families whose children suffer from debilitating brain conditions such as cerebral palsy, there is only one place to go. 

Those who have little or no money to pay for treatment flock to a ramshackle village in Changsha, one of China's fastest-growing cities, which has sprung up in the shadow of a specialist hospital.

The community has become known as the 'brain paralysis village', as families from around the country set up home there in the hope of receiving crucial treatment than can improve the quality of life for their children, according to a report on People's Daily.

Hundreds have moved there - spending upwards of ¥100 (£10.6) per month on rent - because the treatment at the nearby Xiangya Bo'ai Rehabilitation Hospital is completely free, as it is funded by a government scheme. 

Roughly 10 kilometres from the Changsha Railway Station, the village has formed spontaneously, as desperate families arrive to seek medical advice from the largest rehabilitation hospital in central China.

The free service is only open to parents who have run out of money and no longer have any other way of getting help for children who suffer from serious brain problems.

Zhu Dongwen, 43, is one of the many parents living in this village. Both of his twin daughters, born in 2011, suffer from brain paralysis.

'I never found out what that really meant, or why it happened, although I spent all my savings looking for an answer and looking for a cure,' said Mr Zhu.

'In the end we were turned out on the street and in desperation in April last year I managed to get taken in here. I had almost run out of hope, but the community gave me back my hope.'

Mr Zhu came to the village with ¥1,000 (£106) in his pocket in April 2013. Although the treatment is free-of-charge, the families still need money to live off.

Now a full-time carer for daughters Zhu Sihui and Zhu Siying (not their real names) without any stable income, Mr Zhu is spending around ¥3,000 (£318) to support the family's life in the village.

He took out a loan of more than ¥250,000 (£26,422) from various sources, which was spent on seeking care for his daughters, according to another report onChina Daily.

Under the intense treatment being carried out at the centre, the first of his daughters recovered enough control over her body to be able to walk.

A month later his second daughter followed suit, and now they are able to interact with him and carry out many tasks that would have been impossible a year ago.

Mr Zhu said: 'I am finally starting to believe that my girls will now be able to live relatively normal lives and even if something should happen to me they will be able to look after themselves one day. It is an impossible dream come true and all thanks to the chance I had to come here.'

The project is unique to the area and it is not clear where the funding comes from, but children get rooms and care on-site.

And with his daughters' care in hand, Zhu Dongwen is even able to do some work locally to start to save again and build a future for them all outside of the village once they are well enough to leave.

He said: 'I have hope again and it is this place that has given us that hope.'

Treatment in demand: A governmental report suggested that there are around 20,000 children with some form of 'brain paralysis' in Hunan Province in southern China

The village: Housing around 100 families, the neighbourhood is located close to a major hospital offering a scheme which gives free treatment to children with brain paralysis.

According to People's Daily, the scheme plans to help 9,000 such children under seven years old in Hunan.

All of the children are classified as critical when they arrive, and most of them are unable to do anything for themselves.

A government report suggested there are around 20,000 children in Hunan Province who are diagnosed with some form of 'brain paralysis', but only a small portion of them can afford to be treated properly.
