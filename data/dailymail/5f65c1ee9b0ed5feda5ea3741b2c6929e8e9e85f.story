Ukraine's new leader is today to order a unilateral ceasefire in the separatist east as part of a broader plan to end the 10-week insurgency.

His peace plan depends on a rapid response from pro-Moscow separatists and Russia, too, amid reports that the Kremlin is again swelling troop numbers close to its frontier.

His ceasefire move comes hours after a telephone call with Vladimir Putin.

'The peace plan begins with my order for a unilateral ceasefire,' said Petro Poroshenko.

'Immediately after that, we must receive support for the presidential peace plan from all sides involved. This should happen very shortly.'

Russia has long called for Kiev to halt its 'anti terrorism operation' claiming that it means military action against Ukraine's own citizens.

Poroshenko will insist that as part of the ceasefire, the rebels - who want Donetsk and Lugansk regions to join Russia - must disarm.

Previous attempts to secure such a result have failed.

The two leaders discussed a long-term solution to the pro-Kremlin uprising gripping Ukraine's eastern industrial belt since early April.

The Ukrainian leader's office said the two presidents 'discussed a series of priority measures that must be undertaken to implement a ceasefire, as well as the most efficient ways to monitor it.'

The Kremlin confirmed 'the issue of a possible ceasefire in the area of the military operation in Ukraine's southeast had been touched upon.'

Ukraine has sounded new warnings about Russian troops on its borders, with a former Defence Minister claiming a 900-strong 'illegal military formation' has crossed the frontier.

Ex-defence minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk told MPs in Kiev: 'The Ukrainian border was freely crossed by an illegal military formation, which has currently merged with the illegal Zarya battalion.

'There are about 900 people, and they are armed with heavy armoured vehicles.'

His serious claim is the latest on pro-Russian separatists getting access to reinforcements and arms across a porous frontier controlled in key locations by rebels.

Kuzmuk said a detachment of only 100 Ukrainian servicemen was fighting the militants, and had suffered casualties after being outnumbered.
