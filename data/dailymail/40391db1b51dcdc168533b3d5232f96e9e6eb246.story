Photographs of two of the Paris gunmen meeting with an Al Qaeda recruiter have emerged following the massacres in which 17 innocents lost their lives.

The pictures show Djamel Beghal, 50, a former disciple of the hate clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, with kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly and Charlie Hedbo murderer Cherif  Kouachi.

A police surveillance camera image shows Beghal and Cherif together in 2010, while another photograph shows Coulibaly pictured with the recruiter in France in 2012.

Beghal, 50, is currently in prison in France facing charges of leading a terrorist organisation.

He is known to have met with the gunmen and hosted on-the-run suspect Hayat Boumeddiene for ‘crossbow practice’ while he was under house arrest in France.

Boumeddiene, the radicalised widow of Coublibaly, is now France's most wanted woman after she fled to Syria. 

She is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies after fleeing the country.

She was reported to have flown from Madrid to Istanbul on January 2, crossing the Turkish border into Syria on Thursday.

This was the day after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.  

Beghal and Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre, were on such good terms that intelligence officers saw them playing football together with two other terrorists

It was also the day her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, murdered a female police officer before shooting four hostages at a kosher delicatessen in Eastern Paris. 

The suggestion is that Boumeddiene knew the attacks were due to take place and fled. 

Beghal, a French citizen born in Algeria, lived in Britain during the late 1990s where he was a regular at Finsbury Park Mosque and came under the influence of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada.  

But he later moved with his family to Afghanistan – allegedly because he was inspired by Qatada – and was arrested as a suspected terrorist just weeks before the 9/11 attacks and subsequently convicted in France for his links to Al Qaeda in 2005.

After being arrested at Dubai Airport in 2001 for carrying a false passport, he was accused in court of adhering to Takfir wal Hijra - a secretive Islamic movement financed by Osama bin Laden.

After serving half of a ten-year sentence, the French government were attempting to deport him to Algeria when he was rearrested in 2010 on fresh charges.

Jailed: Beghal was jailed for ten years for terrorism offences and is banned from the UK

But Beghal came under fresh scrutiny last week as it emerged that Cherif, and Coulibaly and wife Boumeddiene, had all visited him in Murat, central France, while he was under house arrest.

Today it was revealed Beghal's wife, Sylvie Beghal, 45, is appealing against her own terror conviction on human rights grounds.

In a case that has already cost UK taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, Mrs Beghal, who lives on benefits the UK, is seeking to overturn her conviction for refusing to co-operate with British police who were investigating her husband.

French citizen Mrs Beghal and the couple’s four children still live in Leicester where she is awaiting judgment on her case after taking her appeal all the way to the Supreme Court.

Three years ago she was arrested and charged after being stopped at a British airport, where she refused to answer questions about her husband.

She pleaded guilty to at least one charge related to terror laws but later appealed against the conviction on human rights grounds.

When questioned later by police, Boumeddiene, photographed posing with weapons in a burka, said she and her husband had visited the convicted terrorist for ‘crossbow practice’. 

Officers also photographed Beghal playing football with Kouachi in 2010.

A Finsbury Park Mosque spokesman said last week: ‘Any attempts to link our mosque to at least one of the men suspected of carrying out the attack are completely false.

‘We have no information about any connections he had with those who ran the mosque previously.

‘Anyone who visited Finsbury Park Mosque in any capacity prior to February 2005 did so under the previous management which was removed after a very public struggle against it.'
