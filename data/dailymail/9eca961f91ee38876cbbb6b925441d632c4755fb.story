If you want to snap a photo of yourself in the mirror lifting weights don't bother doing it at this gym - they've actually made it impossible. 

Lift Performance Centre in Sydney, which only opened in November, has broken the norm and designed its gym entirely without mirrors.

Owner Cato Rutherford says it's about getting 'back to basics' so loud music, televisions and treadmills have also been banned.

'I think it's outrageous that people think they need a mirror to do a work out,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It certainly bleeds into the idea people are just there to have a good look at themselves. 

'I've seen people walking from one area to another and trip over because they're looking at themselves.'

He said people just assume you need a mirror when you're lifting weights to check 'your form', but he believes it can actually distract gym-goers from working out harder.

'When people say you have to have mirrors to check your form, I disagree. It's only two dimensional - not much happens on the front, all the important stuff happens behind,' he said.

There's studies that show people who use a mirror to watch themselves workout can get so distracted they can't stick to the exercise routine and often compare themselves to others, which could lower their self-esteem, according to Mr Rutherford. 

'We've limited music to just below talking level – that way coaches can talk to the clients without yelling,' he said.

'There's no treadmills either. There's a perfectly good park up the road. The weather is never so bad that you can't get out and have a bit of a trot.

'I have a place where people don't have to be distracted by pop music and mirrors and can just focus on what's at hand.'

Extra loud music, televisions and treadmills have also been banned at the Sydney gym
