A chip shop boss has turned a giant TV cartoon food into reality by cooking a 10,000-calorie burger.

Dubbed the ‘Ulti-Meatum’, the sandwich created by Corinne Clarkson, 39, in Preston, Lancashire, is a cheeseburger encased in another burger and held together by two buns, also made from burgers.

The dish - being sold for £20 at the Mister Eaters restaurant in the city - is modelled on a meal from The Best Burger In The World episode of Cartoon Network hit The Regular Show.

In the show, the characters of 
Mordecai, a Blue Jay and a raccoon named Rigby do everything they can to
 try and eat the burger, which is so good it can only be sold to one 
customer every 100 years.

But
 fans can now get their hands on a real-life version of the calorific 
creation for free - only if they dare to take on the challenge of 
finishing it in one.

Anyone
 who attempts the Man v. Food-style challenge will have to consume five 
pounds of beef, as well as six slices of cheese and three whole buns.

Mrs
 Clarkson, who runs Mister Eaters with her 54-year-old husband John, 
said: ‘I saw a few people had tried to make it on YouTube but they were 
terrible.

‘I wanted to do it properly and it took me four attempts to get it right. It had to be perfect and luckily on the fourth time it was. If anybody wants to have a go at eating this, they can try.

‘I couldn't eat it - I haven't even been tempted yet. It's massive. There must be someone in the country who wants to try - and they're more than welcome.

‘It's possibly one of the biggest burgers in the country. It's probably for the best that the show only sells the Ulti-Meatum once every 100 years because I certainly wouldn't recommend eating this every week.’

It's not just those up for the eye-watering challenge who can taste the burger.  For £20, Mr Clarkson said he will also cook the sections and sell them so customers can assemble the parts at home.

The former butcher, who has ran the chip shop for 25 years, made all the burgers himself using an old recipe and ordered huge buns to accommodate the meat.

He added: ‘We always do extreme things. There's no point doing something half-heartedly. You have to go to the extreme to get noticed.’

The Ulti-Meatum is a large cheeseburger, cooked into a larger burger with two other burgers for buns.

It is made by putting one cheeseburger inside another cheeseburger and using two deep fried cheeseburgers as buns.

Tomatoes, lettuce and bread buns are then added around it, to create the monstrosity. In Cartoon Network programme The Regular Show, 'Himalayan Ketchup' is also added.

The Regular Show sees characters Blue Jay and Rigby try and avoid working as groundskeepers at the local park. One of its voice actors is former Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill.

The Clarksons have form when it comes to creating huge foods. MailOnline reported three weeks ago how they created the world's largest Ferrero Rocher caked in batter.

Mr Clarkson made an 11lbs version of the sweet made famous in the 'ambassador's party' TV advert - but gave it an extra twist using his own recipe. It is ten times the usual size of one.

He came up with the idea after an initial batch of normal-sized Ferrero Rochers dipped in batter proved to be a surprise hit with customers.
