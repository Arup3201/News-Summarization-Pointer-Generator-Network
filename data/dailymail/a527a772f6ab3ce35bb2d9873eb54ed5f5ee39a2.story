A British man has been raped at Munich's world famous Oktoberfest beer festival, while he was relieving himself behind a bush.

The 24-year-old man, who has not been named, was attacked by two men when he went to some bushes away from the crowds at the edge of the festival area.

A man approached him and said he wanted to have sex with him, according to Munich police. The 24-year-old, who is believed to come from Leeds, rejected his advance.

But he was then attacked from behind and forced to the ground. One man held him down while another man raped him.

The two assailants then fled, and police are still searching for clues as to their identity. 

The incident took place at the edges of the Theresienwiese, a large open space on the outskirts of Munich where Oktoberfest is held each year.

Most of the area is taken up with brightly lit beer tents and huge crowds of festival-goers, but there are dark and quiet areas around the edges.

The festival takes place in Theresienwiese, a large area on the outskirts of Munich, and runs until October 5

Oktoberfest was opened on Saturday with the annual Bavarian beer festival set to run until October 5.

Some 6.4 million people are expected at the 2014 festivities that have inspired imitations around the world. 

The festival brings hundreds of millions to the local economy, with an estimated £252m flowing at the venues themselves.

Over the 16 days, the festival is expected to attract 6.4 million revellers. 

The first Oktoberfest was held in 1810, in honor of the Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig's marriage to Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. 

Toilets are a frequent issue, with large quantities of beer being consumed, and in 2004 queues became so long police had to be called in to control them. It is not unusual for festival-goers to try to find a secluded spot to relieve themselves.

The attack on the Briton comes just days after a woman on her way home from the festival was assaulted by a 16-year-old boy, who tore some of her clothes and attempted to molest her.

Passers by heard her cries for help and came to her aid before he could rape her. 

Elsewhere, a 27-year-old Italian was held after trying to attack a 20-year-old man with a bread knife. 

An American soldier was also taken into custody for rampaging through one of the marquees. On his way to the Oktoberfest's temporary police station he started screaming 'Nazis' at the security guards. He then bit a police officer on the left arm.

Keeping order: Overall there have been 659 crimes reported in the first week of Oktoberfest

Despite the incidents, Munich police say crime, including sexual assaults, is down at this year's Oktoberfest compared to previous years.

So far there have been seven sexual assaults this year, including two rapes, compared to twelve last year. 

Overall there have been 659 crimes reported in the first week of Oktoberfest, compared to 831 last year.

As of Saturday night, 3.3million people have visited the Oktoberfest so far this year.
