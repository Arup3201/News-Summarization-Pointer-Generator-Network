Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has revealed that she terminated two pregnancies for medical reasons in the 1990s, including one where the fetus had developed a severe brain abnormality.

In her new memoir Forgetting to Be Afraid, Davis writes that she had an abortion after an exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides.

The book also describes ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus.

New revelations: Wendy Davis has admitted to having two abortions for medical reasons in the 1990s

Both pregnancies happened before Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career, and after she was already a mother to two young girls, Amber and Dru.

She writes that the ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and that terminating the pregnancy was considered medically necessary. 

Though such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, and the mother's life could be in danger, Davis wrote that in Texas, it's "technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such."

Davis said she and her former husband, Jeff, wound up expecting another child in 1996 after they decided to stop taking birth-control measures. During her second trimester, Davis said she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. 

After a later exam revealed the brain defect, Davis said she sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery.

'I could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,' Davis writes. 

'She was suffering.'

She goes on to say that an 'indescribable blackness followed' the pregnancy, and that the loss left her forever changed.

Davis catapulted to national stardom back in June of 2013 after her eleven-hour filibuster temporarily delayed passage of Senate Bill 5, which contained sweeping new abortion restrictions in the state of Texas.

Despite her efforts, the Bill was eventually signed into law on July 18, 2013.

At one point during the filibuster, Davis said she almost felt compelled to talk about her failed pregnancies, but said she knew it would overshadow her effort to block the bill.

Anti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked her candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice Davis confronted with the second terminated pregnancy, but said they hoped all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy.

'That's an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in. While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,' said Melissa Conway, spokesman for Texans Right to Life.

Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, said in a statement that she was grateful for Davis sharing her story, though 'no woman should have to justify her decision.'  

Davis is now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott.

Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch did not return messages seeking comment.
