Manchester United are preparing to spend another £150million next summer to complete Louis van Gaal's revolution at Old Trafford.

The club have already splashed out £216.4m on additions to their squad since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in the summer of 2013.

And their Dutch manager will be handed another war chest in the New Year, with potential 'Gaal-actico' recruits including Roma's Kevin Strootman, Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin, Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels, Barcelona's Dani Alves and Arjen Robben of Bayern Munich.

Van Gaal also plans to clear the decks by selling fringe members of his squad including the likes of Javier Hernandez, Wilfried Zaha, Tom Cleverley, Nani and Nick Powell, who are currently out on loan.

Players out of contract in the next year of two - including Darren Fletcher, Robin van Persie, Ashley Young, Rafael Da Silva, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones - could also be culled.

We take a look at United's expensive acquisitions since Ferguson retired and assess how they have performed.

Marouane Fellaini (Everton, September 2013, £27.5m)

When David Moyes arrived as Ferguson's successor in the summer of 2013, he wanted to make a statement in the transfer market.

Unfortunately, the eleventh-hour signing of Marouane Fellaini from his old club Everton was pretty underwhelming for United fans given the top names they were linked to.

The mop-haired Belgian struggled and became a convenient scapegoat for the United fans as the club slumped to a seventh-place finish in the Premier League and bombed out of the cups.

Fellaini has shown signs of returning to his old combative self since Van Gaal arrived, with his all-action performance in the draw with Chelsea the most impressive so far.

Juan Mata (Chelsea, January 2014, £37.1m)

With United struggling to stand the pace in the Premier League title race, Moyes splashed out £37m to bring in Mata in the January window.

The Spaniard quickly made a positive impression with his incisive passing and intelligent movement and he scored six goals.

Since Van Gaal's arrival, Mata has been in and out of the starting line-up, but has impressed when he's been involved.

He has scored in matches against Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Crystal Palace and Stoke City, suggesting he has an important role to play in the side.

Juan Mata has been consistently excellent for United since joining from Chelsea last January

Ander Herrera (Athletic Bilbao, June 2014, £29m)

Knowing they had to recover lost ground and qualify again for the Champions League, United wasted little time in strengthening their squad in the summer.

The signing of Herrera, who had been strongly linked with the club 12 months earlier, was completed for £29m prior to the World Cup.

The Spanish midfielder has shown his class in spells so far this season, either side of a fractured rib that forced him out of a few games, and he was particularly influential against Stoke this week.

Luke Shaw (Southampton, June 2014, £27m)

United were very keen to buy Southampton left back Shaw and paid a pretty penny to bring the teenager to Manchester.

His start to life at Old Trafford wasn't the best, suffering a hamstring injury which ruled him out of the first three Premier League matches of the campaign.

And he struggled a little to get up to the pace of United's play initially but has in some matches started to demonstrate the class and capability that has him earmarked as a potentially world class talent.

Unfortunately, his momentum has again been stalled by an ankle ligament injury suffered against Arsenal that will keep him out for up to six weeks.

Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon, August 2014, £16m)

Knowing United were in desperate need of some steel at the back, Van Gaal brought in Argentina's versatile defender Rojo from Sporting Lisbon late in the transfer window.

At first, he looked to be a bit of a liability, struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the Premier League. The same could be said of United's defence as a whole in certain games.

Rojo dislocated his shoulder in the Manchester derby but returned after missing two games and United are slowly starting to look more composed at the back.

It's undeniable that United are still in need of an experienced centre half to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, who both left in the summer, in the long-term.

Angel di Maria (Real Madrid, August 2014, £60m)

The marquee signing of United's summer, prizing Di Maria away from European champions Real Madrid represented a real coup - though they had to pay a British record £60m to get him.

The Argentine has adapted superbly to the demands of the Premier League, contributing three goals and six assists in his 11 appearances to date.

Some of the trickery and passing produced by Di Maria has been mesmerising and it's easy to see why Cristiano Ronaldo was so upset when he learned he was leaving Real.

Di Maria looks like being a mainstay at Old Trafford for many years to come and is integral to their recovery.

Daley Blind (Ajax, September 2014, £13.8m)

Having worked with Blind during his time as Holland manager, Van Gaal was eager to sign him after arriving at Old Trafford.

Far more than a defensive midfielder, Blind offers not only protection for the back line but also plenty of gas going forward.

But just as he was starting to find his feet, Blind fell victim to United's injury curse. He damaged knee ligaments in Holland's Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia and will be out for a few weeks yet.

Radamel Falcao (Monaco, September 2014, £6m loan fee)

The most unexpected signing of United's summer, Falcao arrived on a season-long loan from Monaco on transfer deadline day after they had seen off interest from Man City.

United, who paid a £6m loan fee, have the option to sign permanently for another £43.5m at the end of the season.

However, this is now in doubt as United have serious concerns about Falcao's fitness - he had just returned from a long lay-off with knee problems - and form (he has scored just once since joining).
