Fire-breathing political advocates from the both sides of America's political divide have issued new calls for Barack Obama to fire his attorney general, Eric Holder. LIberal radio show host Bill Press weighed in on the air Friday, and then in a series of tweets, while Texas Senator John Cornyn put a target on Holder's back during a Sunday television appearance.

'I think it’s past time for him to go and for the president to appoint somebody who the public can have confidence in,' the ultra-conservative Cornyn said on the CBS show Face The Nation.

'You know, I've lost confidence in the attorney general a long time ago,' he added, 'over his cover-up over the Fast and Furious investigation.'

Barack Obama (L) and Eric Holder (R) are long-time friends, but the pressure to cut loose his attorney general is mounting on the president - from both sides of the political aisle

Bill Press (L) and Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn (R) have both come out against Holder, in the latest suggestion that Obama's hold on his attorney general may soon fracture

Operation Fast and Furious was a Department of Justice program that furnished about 2,000 guns to people between 2006 and 2011, and encouraged them to take the weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border. While the government hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels, most of them were lost - at more than 300 people were killed, including a U.S. Border Patrol agent.

The U.S. House of Representatives cited Holder for Contempt of Congress last year, in a stunning criticism of his decision to withhold tens of thousands of pages of documents related to the spectacularly failed law enforcement operation.

On Friday, broadcaster Bill Press surprised his left-leaning fan base by tweeting that 'I STILL think Obama should fire Eric Holder.'

'Holder has ignored Wall St, he continues war on drugs, he let Cheney and Bush off the hook,'Press complained. 'Now, he's chasing the AP over phone records.'

Bill Press, a one-time co-host of CNN's Crossfire program, is a loud and unavoidable voice on the American political left

Holder's Justice Department is embroiled in a national scandal after secretly spying on phone-call logs belonging to at least 20 Associated Press employees - including their private mobile numbers, and at least one land-line phone in the U.S. Capitol - in the hope of tracking a national security leak about a classified CIA mission.

Although federal rules require the DOJ to alert media outlets before going after their records, that did not happen.

Holder told a congressional committee last week that he had recused himself from the case, despite a federal law requiring him to personally sign off on subpoenas for journalists' records.

President Obama continues to express 'confidence' in his attorney general, even as pressure mounts behind the scenes to replace him.

The administration has been slammed with a troika of simultaneous political crises in May. in addition to the AP phone-records issue, controversies still rage over the Internal Revenue Service targeting conservative nonprofit groups for aggressive scrutiny, and the apparent roles of the White House and State Department in doctoring the CIA's assessment of a terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.

Press slammed Holder for presiding over the loss of two terror suspects from the Federal Witness Protection Program. The DOJ reportedly lost track of them after the Transportation Safety Administration wasn't provided with their new, government-constructed identities

Press, who appeared on the Washington, DC radio station WMAL on Friday, also weighed in on the recent revelation that the DOJ had failed to keep tabs on two terror suspects who were given new identities in exchange for information.

'On top of ALL of that,' he wrote, 'Holder's Justice Dep LOST TRACK of at least two terrorists in witness protection. Time for Holder to GO. Fire him.'

Earlier in the week he had opined that 'I have no confidence in Eric Holder anymore, and you shouldn’t either. This AP story from the Justice Dept is too far-reaching. Seizing these phone records is a violation of freedom of the press.'

Press is himself a former chairman of the California Democratic Party.

Other commentators who have called for Holder's sacking in recent weeks include Esquire magazine's Charles Pierce, Daily Beast correspondent Michael Tomasky, former MSNBC anchor David Shuster and former Current TV host Keith Olbermann.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has also called on the president to send Holder packing.

David Shuster, formerly of MSNBC, jumped on the fire-Holder bandwagon on May 13

On his once-popular TV show, Keith Olbermann named a nightly 'Worst Person In The World,' a dishonor Holder has only escaped because Olbermann has been fired from his job

Eric Holder testified before the House Judiciary Committee and defended his DOJ's seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. The Obama administration has danced on the fine line, since then, between protecting national security and honoring the press freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution

Obama, Tomasky wrote in an online essay, 'ought to ask for Holder’s resignation. This week. Enough already. Holder's rights here aren't more important than Obama sending a strong signal that he is in charge and can make hard decisions.'

Olbermann tweeted his disapproval with the Associated Press phone-records scandal. 'If Mr. Holder continues to support this rogue 
action, he should resign,' he wrote.

Shuster, also on the political left, called the Justice Department's seizure of journalists' phone records 'outrageous and sickening,'

'Mr. President,' he tweeted, 'you must fire AG Holder.'

At one point during the fall of 2012, more than 130 members of Congress were on record supporting Eric Holder's resignation or firing because of Operation Fast and Furious.
