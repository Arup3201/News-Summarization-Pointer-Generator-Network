A suspected looter in this week’s riots and his mother are being thrown out of their council home.

In
 the first case of its kind, Daniel Sartain-Clarke, 18, and his mother 
have been served with an eviction notice as council bosses seek to turf 
them out of their £225,000 taxpayer-subsidised flat.

Sartain-Clarke
 is charged with violent disorder and attempting to steal electronic 
goods from the  Currys store at Clapham Junction, South London, on 
Monday night.

Under housing rules his mother – as 
the tenant – can be evicted from their two-bedroom flat in Battersea if 
anyone living there is involved in criminality.

There is likely to be a 
flood of similar cases as council leaders across England respond to 
public demands that looters face the toughest penalties possible.

In another day of dramatic developments:

Sartain-Clarke was arrested after 
more than 100 looters went on the rampage on Monday night. For two hours,
 the mob ransacked mobile phone stores and sports shops such as Foot 
Locker and JD Sports.

He appeared before magistrates in Battersea on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to burglary and violent disorder. He and two co-defendants were remanded in custody.

Last night Ravi Govindia, the leader 
of Wandsworth Council, which issued the eviction notice, said he wanted 
the ‘strongest possible action’ taken against rioters and looters.

‘This council will do its utmost to 
ensure that those who are responsible pay a proper price,’ he said. 
‘Ultimately this could lead to eviction from their homes.

‘Our officers will continue to work 
with the courts to establish the identities of other council tenants or 
members of their households as more cases are processed in the coming 
days and weeks.

‘Most residents on our housing estates
 are decent law-abiding citizens who will have been sickened at the 
scenes they witnessed on their TV screens this week.

‘As much as anything else we owe it to them to send out a strong signal that this kind of violence will not be tolerated.’

But Sartain-Clarke’s mother said her human rights had been ‘taken for granted’.

Spanish-born Maite de la Calva, 43, said: ‘I understand there are people who have got to face justice because all this has been madness and savagery.

‘But, I believe our human rights have been completely taken for granted. Daniel was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

‘As a mother, I’m not responsible for my son’s actions and they are penalising me for his actions.’

The part-time worker 
said the decision had left her ‘very upset’ and she did not know where she and daughter Revecca, eight, would go.

Sartain-Clarke is being held at Feltham Prison, and his mother said he was ‘terrified’ of other prisoners and gangsters.

She said: ‘The other prisoners have been threatening the rioters. Daniel doesn’t know how to fight or defend himself. It’s breaking my heart right now. I left him so afraid.’

She claimed her son helped out in the community and had no history of trouble.

‘He’s a staunch member of the church,’ she said. ‘My son didn’t have a hoodie or balaclava. His face was clean and open. He’s very passive. He’s even been diagnosed with depression because he’s too passive.’

She added that his girlfriend J-Niel Starkei, 18, who was also arrested, had a promising career ahead of her.

She said: ‘She’s a nice girl, not a troublemaker. She was going to start an apprenticeship this September in event management and work part-time at a casino at Westfield shopping centre.’

Yesterday other councils including 
Manchester and Nottingham announced plans to evict the families of 
trouble-makers hauled before the courts for looting.

Bosses at Manchester City Council 
said they are preparing to evict the family of a 12-year-old boy 
photographed stealing a £7.49 bottle of wine from a Sainsbury’s store.

The boy was charged with burglary and
 was given a nine-month referral order on Thursday, which means he must 
see a probation ofﬁcer once a fortnight. His 33-year-old mother, who has
 a

14-year-old daughter and a husband 
soon to be released from prison, said losing their home was her ‘biggest
 fear’ but admitted there was no excuse for his behaviour.

On a visit to Manchester yesterday, David Cameron repeated his determination to see looters evicted from council houses.

‘For too long we’ve taken a too-soft 
attitude towards people that loot and pillage their own community,’ he 
told BBC TV’s North West Tonight.

‘If you do that you should lose your right to the sort of housing that you’ve had at subsidised rates. Obviously, that will mean they’ve got to be housed somewhere else.

‘They’ll have to find housing in the 
private sector and that will be tougher for them, but they should have 
thought of that before they started burgling.’

And speaking during a visit to riot-hit businesses in Manchester, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg made it clear that it was right that local authorities should consider eviction.

He said: 'If you go out and trash other people's houses, you burn cars, you loot and smash up shops - in other words, if you show absolutely no sense of respect to your own community - then, of course, questions need to be asked whether the community should support you in living in that community.

'I think that is a perfectly fair question to ask, but how you apply it needs to be done in a case-by-case way.

'The principle that if you are getting some support from the community, you are going to have to show some loyalty to that community is a really, really important one.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband, in Hackney, added: 'When council tenants sign agreements they sign up to agreements about behaviour, and local authorities have powers to deal with those things.

'What local authorities need to do is weigh up the decisions that they are making. If they think there are ways in which we can encourage parental responsibly then they should make those right decisions but they should always do so in a way that is actually going to help local communities and not harm them.'

Earlier this week a petition calling 
for the thieves to lose all their welfare handouts became the first to 
be passed to Parliament under a new scheme.

It
 gathered more than 100,000 signatures – the threshold to trigger a 
Commons debate. The petition received so much web traffic that it 
crashed under the strain.
