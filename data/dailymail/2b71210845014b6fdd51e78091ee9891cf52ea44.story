Stuart Pearce has been sacked by Nottingham Forest following the dismal 1-0 loss at home to Championship strugglers Millwall, which capped a run of three wins in 23 matches.

Owner Fawaz Al Hasawi met with Pearce on Sunday afternoon culminating in the club’s legendary former player leaving after seven months in charge.

Dan Petrescu is set to be interviewed for the vacancy and is in pole position to become Al-Hasawi’s fifth manager since taking control in July 2012.

Pressure has been mounting on Pearce for a considerable period and Sportsmail reported three weeks ago how Al-Hasawi had sought counsel from players over his management style, also sending associates to watch training.

The dramatic victory over rivals Derby is believed to have granted Pearce more time but the alarming first-half performance in defeat to Fulham which followed brought his position under scrutiny again.

Saturday’s defeat at the City Ground made his role untenable.

Petrescu, the former Chelsea defender, is known to Al-Hasawi and is keen to work in England following spells in Romania, Poland and Russia.

Last month, Sportsmail revealed that Pearce's position was under severe pressure.

After long discussions between owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi and manager Stuart Pearce, the club has decided that Stuart will be relieved of his role as manager with immediate effect.

Mr Al Hasawi has offered Stuart an alternative role at the club, which he is currently considering.

The club will be making no further comment at this time.

Nottingham Forest released a statement on Sunday confirming the dismissal of Pearce. 

It read: 'After long discussions between owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi and manager Stuart Pearce, the club has decided that Stuart will be relieved of his role as manager with immediate effect.

Owner Al Hasawi also issued a statement on Nottingham Forest's website.

It read: ''I would like to place on record my gratitude to Stuart Pearce for all his endeavours during his time as manager of Nottingham Forest. My decision to relieve Stuart of his duties is the hardest footballing decision I have ever made.

'I came to that decision after a long conversation with Stuart about the best next step for the club. Unfortunately, recent results convinced me it was best to pursue alternative managerial options.

'I hope our supporters understand my decision.Stuart is someone I have always admired and that will never change. For that reason I have offered him an advisory role at the club, which I sincerely hope he accepts so we can all move forward together.

'Thank you all for your continued support.'
