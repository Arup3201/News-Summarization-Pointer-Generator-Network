The father of Elliot Rodger's best friend has called for a national debate on gun law and bullying at schools.

James Ellis was described by Rodger as his best friend for more than 14 years while they were growing up in the affluent suburbs just north of Los Angeles.

The pair met at school and later bonded over Pokemon cards, computer games such as Halo and World of Warcraft, and skateboarding.

But despite both being frustrated at their lack of success with the opposite sex, they drifted apart as Rodger’s feeling towards girls became ever more hostile.

Eventually, after a couple of alarming incidents in restaurants, they completely lost touch and went to different colleges.

Yesterday Art Ellis, James’ father who is also a close friend of Rodger’s mother, said: ‘It is such a complex situation for me to make a statement.

'Should there be gun control? Yes that would help. They have warnings on Aspirin saying do not use when operating heavy machinery.

'Yet people on medication get a gun in their hands.'

The graphic designer refused to talk about his son’s friendship with Rodger but said that much must change in society.

'Children should be aware of the effect they have on other children,' he said. 'These kind of things are not taught at schools.'

In his manifesto Rodger spoke about how he met James when he began junior school, and dubbed him King Arthur Kid because he had long blond hair.

He said that he was ‘kicking dust’ in the playground when he noticed Ellis doing the same.

‘We then teamed up and starting playing the game together, and this was the start of a long and interesting friendship,’ he wrote. 

‘This boy’s name was James Ellis, and he would become my best friend for the next 14 years of my life.’

However even in the early days Rodger said he felt left out by his best friend.

'During playdates with James, sometimes he would have other friends over as well, and I would feel very jealous and upset when he paid more attention to them. 

'Feeling left out, I would find a quiet corner and start crying.'

The pair remained best friends, sleeping over at each other’s houses all the time and still playing video games.

During the difficult teenage years in which he became increasingly isolated and frustrated, Rodger said Ellis was his only friend.

Parted: Rodger's friendship with James ended when he started to discuss how seeing couples made him angry

'James would be my only friend throughout the next depressing and lonely period of my life,' he wrote. 'My friendship with James helped me cope with the loneliness. The very few fun times we would have were like a light in the darkness for me.’ 

As teenagers they talked about their lack of a sex life.

'James was in a similar situation as I was,’ he wrote. 'He was a virgin like me, never having much interaction with girls in his life. 

'The two of us talked for hours about our troubles and our hopes of overcoming them. 

'It was nice to have such a good friend like James on my side, who could understnd and relate to me.'

But their friendship started falling apart when Rodger told James about his hatred and anger towards girls and people who had sex.

He started telling James how he wanted to attack couples showing affection in restaurants.

'I thought that James would relate to me, since he was also a virgin who had no girls in his life, but some of the things I said began to disturb him,' he wrote.

'One night, he told me, with a lot of distress, that enough was enough. He didn’t want to hear it anymore.'

Their friendship ended and they went to different colleges.
