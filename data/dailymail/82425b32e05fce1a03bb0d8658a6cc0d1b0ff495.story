Victoria's Secret has celebrated the opening of its first NFL stadium store.

Located at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the retail spot stocks a range of co-branded Victoria's Secret PINK and Dallas Cowboys merchandise including hoodies, sports bras and thongs.

Lingerie models Jessica Hart and Elsa Hosk were on hand to showcase wares from the new sports-inspired line at a launch party held yesterday.

Both sported minimal make-up and naturally styled hair as they greeted customers and posed for pictures with the football team's mascot, Rowdy.

While both women are usually seen modelling flesh-baring pieces from the Victoria's Secret label, yesterday they covered up in blue and white baggy tees and jeans.

Commenting on the decision to open a Victoria's Secret PINK store at his $1.2 billion arena, Jerry Jones told KRLD-FM: 'We think it's cute as a bug and very in place to show it and sell it out there.'

While the strategic move will no doubt boost profits for both parties, one website has questioned the collaboration.

 'What I'm really looking for is a little more information about how 
Jerry Jones made this decision. Any words from the big guy himself?... 
What's the reason? Why? How is this relevant?'

The Dallas Cowboys were revealed as the NFL's most valuable team this year, for the sixth consecutive time by Forbes magazine.

Mr Jones' daughter Charlotte Anderson, who is responsible for the team's brand management also attended Monday's ceremonial ribbon-cutting.
