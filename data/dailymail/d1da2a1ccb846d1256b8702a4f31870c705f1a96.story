When Lulu Melotte lost her business in the recession, she made the life-altering choice of taking her children out of school and spent all her savings on a family trip around the world.

Mother-of-two Lulu, 40, was living in Barcelona with husband Nacho, 38, when the economic downturn forced her to give up her job running an organic shop.

Her husband was made redundant around the same time, so the couple decided to leave Spain behind and explore the world with their children  Frida, three, and seven-year-old Leon.

Family adventure: Lulu and Nacho Melotte gave up their lives in Barcelona, Spain and took her children Frida, three, and Leon, seven on trip around Asia

Lulu, from Putney, south-west London, has spent every penny she owns on her family's six-month tour of Asia, but says she does not regret emptying her purse on the trip.

The Melottes visited Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Singapore and Indonesia at a cost of £9,000, budgeting for a £1,000-a-month living expenses after spending £3,000 on flights.

Lulu, who moved to Spain after a holiday romance with Nacho, said: ‘Everyone was losing their jobs left, right and centre, so we thought the best thing to do was leave the country.

‘We had always discussed travelling with our children as we thought it would be a wonderful thing to do as a family and they were the ideal ages.

‘Nacho had some redundancy money, and we thought rather than pay it into a bank which could collapse overnight, we'd go on an adventure. So that's what we did.'

Learning from life: Lulu believes Frida and Leon, pictured riding an elephant for the first time in Pai,Thailand, have learned invaluable lessons that they could never have been taught in a school

Lulu has no qualms over taking her children out of education in order for them to see the world, saying Frida and Leon have been taught in the 'school of life’.

‘We did a lot of sightseeing and the children saw their first elephants and monkeys on our travels and both learnt to snorkel.

‘We saw a lot of poverty too. My little girl gave her favourite bright pink shoes to a baby who lived on the street and we gave the family toys and clothes too.

‘They spent a lot of time playing with street kids and made a lot of friends along the way but it's hard for them to build friendships because we were always moving on.

‘The kids didn't like the creepy crawlies much and sometimes we had to bang on the floor to rid them of snakes.’

Carpe diem: Adventurous Lulu, snapped enjoying Bali, says she has no regrets removing her children from school and spending all the family's money on the trip

The family are now living in Putney with Lulu's parents, repaying credit card debts and building a new life, but despite this, Lulu believes she made the right choice.

She said: ‘Three of friends all my age with children have died and that shows life is too short.

‘I
 have spent six quality months with my babies and the most important 
thing in life is your health and happiness - it's not about materialism 
and money.’

Lulu, who is working part-time in a cafe, added: ‘The last six months have been a whizz.

‘We are desperately trying to keep the adventure going for the children but they will probably not fully appreciate what they have done until they are older and look back.'
