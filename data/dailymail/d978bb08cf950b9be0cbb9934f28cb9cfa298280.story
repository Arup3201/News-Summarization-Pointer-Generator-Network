A primary school has raised the bar for its pupils – quite literally.

Metal bars have been fitted to desks to stop the children getting too close to their books and becoming short-sighted.

In the position pictured below, the bars prevent youngsters from leaning too closely over their exercise books as they write.

This primary school in China has installed bars on to all students' desks to help them read at a safe distance

The school, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, said the bars will prevent children from 'damaging their eyes'

The bar can also be pushed forwards 
away from the child who can then rest a book against it at the 
appropriate distance for reading.

The
 idea is being tried at a school in China. Long hours in class and a 
lack of outdoor play are blamed for an ‘epidemic’ among China’s 
youngsters of short-sightedness, where distant objects appear blurred 
while near ones are clear.

Teachers at Zhang Lin Elementary in Wuhan, central China, said the bars
 will help children develop good reading habits and prevent them from 
damaging their eyes.

Constant close work may contribute to short-sightedness, so holding books at a distance could keep it at bay.

Some
 41 per cent of primary school children in China now need glasses, and 
by the time they leave school, up to 90 per cent will be short-sighted.

In
 contrast, around one in three Britons is short-sighted although this is
 on the rise as we too spend more time indoors and looking closely at 
computer and TV screens.

Ren
 Weibing, who advises Chinese parents on how to avoid problems with 
their children’s eyesight, said: ‘When I was in primary school in the 
1970s, no one wore glasses.

Headmaster Zhang Jianming said the bars were installed by the City Teen Anti-Myopia Office

The bars can be used both for resting the books on as well as keeping childrens' eyes a safe distance from their books

‘But
 we did not have televisions or computers and we spent our time playing 
outside. Today, children spend a prolonged amount of time staring at 
things at close distance.

‘Parents
 are unaware of the serious consequences of poor eyesight and only care 
about good results for their children at school.’

Australian
 scientist Professor Ian Morgan, who published on the topic in the 
Lancet, said that while long hours on schoolwork puts pressure on the 
eyes, exposure to daylight can be protective.

It is thought it triggers the release of chemicals that prevent the distortion of the eyeball behind short-sightedness.

He added that the daytime naps common in South East Asian schools deprive children of primetime exposure to light.

Headmaster Zhang Jianming, of the Zhang Lin Elementary School, said the bars were installed by the City Teen Anti-Myopia Office.

He explained that they will be used to help children develop good reading habits.

The bars can be moved up and down to stop students moving their heads too close to the books.

The bars can also be pushed back to the distance at which children should be holding their books.
