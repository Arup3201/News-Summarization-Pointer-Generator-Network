A new report has shown that Australia’s ecosystems and habitats are under threat, with 138 species residing on unprotected land.

Among the list of  endangered animals are some of Australia’s most-loved creatures, including the Dawson Yellow Chat, the Northern Hairy-Nosed wombat and the Green Sawfish.

According to the WWF’s most recent findings, 55 animals and 39 plant species are listed as already extinct on the national threatened species list and 1652 species are listed as threatened with extinction.

The Green Sawfish was previously found asfar south as New South Wales waters but now only occurs north of Cairns across northern estuaries

The Yellow Chat has declined to only 200 birds in remnant populations. 

The Hairy-Nosed wombat previously inhabited  a vast space, reaching from central Queensland to the Victorian border. 

Now, just 126 wombats remain in central Queensland while only 100 were found in southern Queensland. 

The Northern Hairy-Nosed wombat is now reduced to just 126 individuals in the last remaining wild population on Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland and 12 recent colonistsat the Richard Underwood Nature Refuge in southern Queensland

The critically endangered health plant, The Northern Serrate Dryandra, occurs in just 16 populations in three location. 

Conservation group WWF has blasted the Government’s low-level investment in maintaining national reserve systems, considering nearly 8 per cent of all life on Earth are found in Australia.

Despite the boost in national reserve funding from Caring for Our Country the Australian Government decided to discontinue its dedicated national reserve fund in late 2012.

The Chat has declined to only 200birds in three remnant populations, and until recently largely unprotectedand subject to livestock use

The report states that this funding was ‘fundamental in driving significant strategic growth in Australia’s protected area estate.’

‘It is highly unlikely Australia can achieve its long-standing commitments to an ecologically representative National Reserve System, and prevent major biodiversity loss, without this dedicated funding pool,’ the report continued.

While the government has allocated a budget of $400 million per year over the next five years to the national reserve system, the WWF realistically believes a further $170 million per year until 2020 will be needed.

The report states that ‘the total cost of Australia achieving a comprehensive, adequate and representative marine reserve system that would satisfy Aichi Target 11 is an estimated $247 million.’

Visitors to national parks and nature reserves spend over $23.6 billion a year in Australia every year, generating tax revenue for state and territory governments of $2.36 billion a year.

The report believes that these economic benefits greatly exceed the annual protected area expansion and management spending by all Australian governments, estimated to be $1.28 billion a year.

The Northern Serrate Dryandra occurs in just 16 populations in threelocations

‘It is clear that Australian society is benefiting far greater than its governments’ investment into strategic growth and maintenance of the National Reserve System,’ the WWF states.

16.5 per cent of Australia’s land mass is under some sort of protection, with national parks making up 8.3% of this total.  

The WWF said in the report that the government should prohibit mining in areas placed under protection and create a network of reserves that protect biodiversity.
