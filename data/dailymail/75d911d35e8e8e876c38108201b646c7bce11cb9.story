Mesut Ozil has complete trust Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can help make him a better player.

The Gunners' record signing is currently recovering from a knee injury suffered at the start of October, and is not expected to feature again until early 2015.

Ozil has been criticised for perceived inconsistent displays, with questions raised over whether the former Real Madrid playmaker can cope under the physical demands of the Barclays Premier League.

Wenger, however, retains complete faith in the £42.5million midfielder, who is in no doubt he is at the right club and under the right manager to move his game forwards.

Speaking to Esquire magazine, Ozil said: 'He (Wenger) knows what he wants and I know he can bring me a step forward; he trusts me in that way and I trust him, completely.

'For a team, it (a trophy) is the biggest thing to get and we got it (last season with the FA Cup), but as a player, there are other things - being the best player in the world, other cups, the Champions League.

The German World Cup winner is currently out with a knee injury and isn't expected back until January 

'For now, I am not making any plans for after my career. I am just really happy to be here.'

Ozil will not let the constant debate over his consistency cloud his focus.

The 26-year-old added: 'I have been in this business so long now, I have been a professional since I was 16, 17.

'I don't care what the press thinks about me as football changes from day to day.

'You can play well one day and badly the next. I'm used to it.'

Arsenal will resume their Premier League campaign on Saturday at home to Manchester United.

The Gunners are down in sixth place and in need of a response having lost 2-1 at Swansea before the international break, which followed on from the draw against Anderlecht in the Champions League when they threw away a 3-0 advantage.

England manager Roy Hodgson has allayed fears over the fitness of Danny Welbeck.

The Arsenal forward, signed on deadline day from United, was substituted during the second half of the friendly against Scotland in Glasgow, but only as a precaution after a 'slight stiffness' in his hamstring.
