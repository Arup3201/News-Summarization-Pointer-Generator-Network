A former Scots Guardsman was under arrest tonight on suspicion of killing the mother of his twin boys after she was found strangled in their home.

John McGrory, 46, was detained by detectives investigating the murder of his wife Marie, who was discovered seriously injured and died hours later in hospital.

The couple’s two 14-year-old sons, who were at the house when the emergency services were called, were today being cared for by relatives as they come to terms with the death of their mother.

Paramedics and police were called to the semi-detached home in Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, yesterday, after a 999 call reporting that a woman had been seriously hurt.

She was rushed to Wycombe General Hospital in High Wycombe where she died despite the efforts of surgeons to save her.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the death of 39-year-old Mrs McGrory was being treated as murder and confirmed that a man had been arrested at the scene.

The house was sealed off as forensic experts combed the property for clues to the killing in what is believed to have been a domestic incident.

Detectives were also searching through Mrs McGrory’s red Audi convertible car and her husband’s silver Ford Galaxy, which were parked outside the house.

Next-door neighbour John Clark, 54, said a friend of his wife claimed she heard a disturbance at the McGrorys’ home the night before the tragedy.

He added: ‘We can’t believe it has happened - it’s horrible. They were just such a nice family, so easy going. They would always stop and say hello.

‘My missus and I have got grandchildren and they (the McGrory’s) would always talk to us about them.’

He said Mr McGrory, was a soldier from Scotland, adding: ‘He was a Guardsman. I think it was the Scots Guards and that he served in the first Gulf War.

‘Since then, he has worked at Heathrow airport and then I think he was a lorry driver.’

Mr McGrory and his wife had teenage identical twin boys, who were believed to have been at the address at the time emergency services were called.

Mr Clark added: ‘My missus saw the ambulance and we both thought “something’s wrong”.

‘Then she saw her (Marie McGrory) being carried out on a stretcher and being put into the ambulance.’

Mr McGrory was arrested around the same time at the house.

Another neighbour said: ‘I saw John being led out to a police car. He was in handcuffs. I couldn’t see his face, but he didn’t seem stressed or upset. He just seemed normal.

‘Then one of the boys came out and was put in another police car and then the other one came out.’

The woman then went outside, where she sat with Marie’s distressed sister, who had been contacted about the incident.

She said: ‘I was walking back and just then they brought her (Marie) out on the stretcher,’ said the neighbour.

‘All I remember is the eyes,’ she said, explaining how she had learned years ago that the eyes of strangulation victims bulge.

She described the former serviceman as ‘all arms and legs’, saying he was lanky and not at all stocky, while his wife was about a foot shorter than him.
