Arsenal host Manchester City in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, looking to avenge their humiliating 6-3 defeat by Manuel Pellegrini's side at the Etihad last season.

The Gunners are unbeaten after a win against Crystal Palace and draws with Everton and Leicester, while the champions suffered a surprise home loss to Stoke City last time out.

It's sure to be an intriguing battle at the Emirates, but who will come out on top? Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp evaluates each team to decide.

Wojciech Szczesny - 7/10

I always get the feeling he can do something erratic but he has improved immensely.

Mathieu Debuchy - 7.5

Looks like he's been at Arsenal a long time. Enjoys defending and plays with aggression.

Mathieu Debuchy has settled in quickly at Arsenal after joining from Newcastle during the summer

Calum Chambers - 7.5

Great start to his Arsenal career and so mature for his age, but today will be his biggest test.

Laurent Koscielny - 8

He's got pace, is tenacious in his defending and reads it well. Has to be on his A game.

Laurent Koscielny is certain to start in the heart of the Gunners' back four against Manchester City

Kieran Gibbs - 7 

Lovely left back but still to prove he's top-class. A run of games without injuries would help.

Mikel Arteta - 8

Technically fantastic and vital as captain, but in big games his lack of pace can show him up.

Jack Wilshere - 8

Mathieu Flamini did well in this game last year so he could play. Wilshere offers more going forward.

Jack Wilshere should be in confident mood after anchoring England's midfield against Switzerland

Aaron Ramsey - 9

lf he's fit, he has to play. He drives this team forward and has become one of Europe's best midfielders.

Alexis Sanchez - 9

Great credentials and a big goal against Besiktas to get started. Lots of competition but such an important player.

Alexis Sanchez already has two Arsenal goals to his name after arriving from Barcelona for £30million

Santi Cazorla - 8.5

I don't know what his best foot is but he's a magician. Has technique, balance and bravery.

Danny Welbeck - 8

If he needs motivation, he got it from Louis van Gaal. No excuses now — needs to get in good positions and score.

Danny Welbeck looks set to make his debut against Manchester City after joining Arsenal on deadline day

TEAM TOTAL - 87.5/110

Arsene Wenger - 8

The pressure is off after winning the FA Cup but he still needs midfield and defensive cover. Danny Welbeck is a good signing and Wenger is now one of our greatest hopes for producing good English players.

Power off the bench - 8.5

Per Mertesacker and Flamini provide plenty of defensive experience while Mesut Ozil, if he's fit, is capable of moments of magic if Wenger needs to get creative.

Joe Hart - 9

Overcame difficulties last season but impressive for England and now in the top five in the world.

Pablo Zabaleta - 9

Love him. Epitomises everything good about foreign players in the Premier League. Plays with energy and passion.

Vincent Kompany - 9

Can struggle with injuries but a colossus and one of the best centre backs in Premier League history.

Captain Vincent Kompany will be aiming for a clean sheet when his side visit the Emirates on Saturday

Martin Demichelis - 7.5

Bit of a laughing stock when he arrived but answered his critics. With Eliaquim Mangala around, he has to keep it up.

Gael Clichy - 7.5

Rotates with Aleksandar Kolarov so stays fresh. Not much between the two but Clichy can be vulnerable.

Samir Nasri - 8

Underestimated but very talented. Will need some earplugs because he'll get plenty of stick.

Samir Nasri will face a hostile atmosphere when he returns to his former club Arsenal

Fernandinho - 8

A disappointing World Cup but comfortable on the ball and a good minder for Toure.

Yaya Toure - 9

Monster of a midfielder. Yet to hit the heights of last year but it's only a matter of time.

Yaya Toure is the driving force in Manchester City's midfield but he has not found top form yet

David Silva - 9

A maestro. Has balance, poise and genius in his feet. I could watch him all day.

Sergio Aguero - 9

One of the best in the world, barring injuries. With a good run, he's a goal-a-game man.

Sergio Aguero bends the ball beyond Tim Krul to seal a 2-0 win at Newcastle in City's first game of the season

Edin Dzeko - 8

No longer just a super sub. Improving under Manuel Pellegrini and playing with the confidence strikers need.

TEAM TOTAL - 93/110

Manuel Pellegrini - 8

The antithesis of Roberto Mancini. Doesn't fall out with his senior players and looks to get them on side. Poor result against Stoke, so he will not want another. City have not lost two straight league games since October 2010.

Power off the bench - 8

Excellent defensive options in Kolarov and Mangala. Jesus Navas can stretch a game or James Milner can shore it up, but with Stevan Jovetic out they are light on attacking options.
