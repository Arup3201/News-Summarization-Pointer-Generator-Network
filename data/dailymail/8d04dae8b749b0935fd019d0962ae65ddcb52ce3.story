The situation at Leeds United grows yet more toxic with managing director David Haigh severing contact with owners GFH Capital but staying at the helm at Elland Road.

Troubled Leeds are in limbo while the Football League decide whether prospective buyer Massimo Cellino, who faces a fraud trial in Italy next week, passes their owners and directors test.

So Haigh’s acrimonious split with the Dubai-based, Bahrain-owned GFH investment bank, who bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012, will only add to the confusion around a club beaten 5-1 at home by Bolton on Saturday.

Waiting game: Italian Massimo Cellino is hoping to get Football League approval for a takeover of the Yorkshire club

Haigh has told friends he has been left high and dry by the GFH hierarchy while he has tried single-handedly to keep Leeds afloat by finding new loans and investors. This includes putting £1.5million into the club himself.

The disintegration in relationships since GFH agreed a deal with Cagliari owner Cellino to take a 75 per cent stake has been quick.

It was only five weeks ago that Haigh said: ‘I am grateful for the full and continuing support of GFH Capital.’

Still smiling: Leeds boss Brian McDermott has been forced to deal with a number of off-field issues this season

Steven Gerrard has revealed how he benefited from working with sports psychologist Steve Peters, who is going to Brazil with the England squad.

And it will be a further bonus for manager Roy Hodgson that Liverpool believe Peters has contributed significantly to the prime form of Gerrard’s club and international colleagues Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling.

Alan Myers' abrupt departure as Everton head of communications can now be explained with his arrival in the same role at Championship club Blackburn.

Myers, who is understood to have found life difficult at Everton and did not enjoy personal attacks against him on Twitter, forged close links with Blackburn’s Indian owners Venky’s while working for Sky Sports.

Nottingham Forest, neck and neck with Leeds to be the most dysfunctional club in the Championship, are understood to have parted company with head of recruitment Bobby Downes via voicemail.

Downes found out he was leaving after listening to a message left by the financial department. As per usual, Forest’s ‘spokesman’ did not return calls.

St George’s swerved

The FA’s St George’s Park training centre that cost £100m to build is only being occupied by the England team for four days during their three-week World Cup build-up.

The FA say warm weather training in Portugal and Miami is crucial to Roy Hodgson’s plans meaning limited time at SGP in Staffordshire, especially as England travel to the Grove hotel near London the day before Wembley games.

However, sensitivity around SGP usage by the England team can be gauged by the minutes of the last Club England board meeting, which stipulate the senior side will always spend time there in future international weeks.

Staying away: Roy Hodgson's England squad, pictured here at St George's Park in October last year, will spend only four days at the national training centre in their three-week World Cup build-up

Peter Daire and Sean McAuliffe, two senior commercial executives who left the FA following re-structuring, have set up their own company Sport Collective to work across all commercial sports business.

Their departure comes with the FA still a long way from finding a replacement for Budweiser, whose  £9m-a-year FA Cup sponsorship ends in May.

BBC Sport, in their wisdom, believe Boat Race commentator Andrew Cotter’s radio experience will help him call the action for TV and audio audiences after the Beeb’s extraordinary ‘significant savings’ decision to use the TV feed for their radio coverage on April 5.

Meanwhile, the Beeb’s feeble reasoning for interviewing journeymen footballers Robbie Savage and Joey Barton during the England v Wales 6 Nations game was that they would give a different take as professional sportsmen.

FA Cup rules state that opposing teams must wear different coloured shorts, yet Hull City and Sunderland both wore black for their quarter-final.

An FA spokesman said the referee raised no objections and there were different coloured flashings on the shorts.
