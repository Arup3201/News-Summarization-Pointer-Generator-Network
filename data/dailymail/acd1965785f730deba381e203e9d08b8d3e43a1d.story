Hilary Mantel has been praised for her lengthy true-to-life accounts of Tudor Britain - but when it comes to her personal viewing, it seems her tastes are a little less high-brow.

The double Booker prizewinner has admitted she was an avid fan of The Tudors, the BBC show panned by critics for its 'sexed-up, dumbed down' version of English history.

The series began in 2007 as the 61-year-old author was writing her first novel, Wolf Hall, and received hundreds of complaints from viewers and academics who claimed to spot modern radiators, Tarmac driveways, concrete bollards and Victorian carriages.

Ms Mantel giggled as she told Tanya Gold of the Sunday Times Magazine that she watched the show 'avidly'.

She later explained that it was important to see the show because it would have an effect on how the British public thought of the Tudors when her first novel was released in 2009.

'It would condition the world into which Wolf Hall would be born,' she said.

And despite enjoying the programme, the author tactfully confessed that casting the slim, brooding Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the obese wife-killer Henry VII was 'stretching it a bit'.

'You never translate your character into the body of some living person you’d seen out there,' she said. 'When you are writing, your characters are flickering constructs, they are always on the move. It’s much more like people you know well in real life.

Sexed-up: The Tudors, which began in 2007, was criticised for its historical inaccuracies and the choice of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, left, to play the dark and brooding Henry VIII and Right: Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn

Raunchy: The drama contained several explicit sex scenes, including one four minutes into the first episode

Passionate: But viewers claimed they spotted modern radiators, concrete bollards and Victorian carriages

Acclaimed: Ms Mantel's weighty first two novels in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy have each won a Booker prize

'You are not looking at them fixedly every moment to judge their features, what you do have is a general impression of them, of their energy. This means your concept of who can represent that character is totally flexible.

'There could be exceptions: when they cast Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry in The Tudors, I thought that was stretching it a bit.'

Justified: The author said The Tudors conditioned the world into which her first novel was born

With its raunchy explicit sex scenes the BBC drama, which ran for four series, was part of a bid to interest younger audiences in history.

But it strayed too far from the truth for some. Leanda de Lisle, a Tudor biographer, said: 'Overall the series is badly written with an extremely cheap feel to it.

'It is hugely disappointing. With inaccuracies in almost every sentence, the BBC is dumbing down the Tudor period.

'The characters talk in completely unnatural ways, addressing their own family members as "Anne Boleyn" or "Mary Boleyn" so that we, the stupid audience, understand who they're supposed to be.

'Henry VIII was exceedingly powerful, both politically and physically, but Rhys Meyers is pretty, rather than macho and thus completely unconvincing.'

Ms Mantel is the only author ever to have won two Booker prizes for the first two books in a trilogy, Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies.

Her trilogy is about Thomas Cromwell, a little-known adviser to Henry VII, and the third book is due out within the next few years.

Meanwhile the author is putting together a stage version of Wolf Hall with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which will open in Stratford-upon-Avon this week.
