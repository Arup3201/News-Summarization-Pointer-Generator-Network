Women over 40 will be entitled to free fertility treatment on the NHS for the first time under Government guidelines to be published this week.

The NHS is set to extend the controversial upper age limit for IVF by three years to 42,  following advice that suggests many women in their late 30s and early 40s could conceive after treatment.

The current guidance is that the NHS should not provide IVF to women over the age of 39.

Government guidelines: Women over 40 will be entitled to free fertility treatment on the NHS for the first time

Now 8,000 more women a year could have the chance to become mothers without having to pay £5,000 to private clinics.

Fertility experts said the recommendations may encourage more women to delay having babies until middle age, which puts both mother and child at risk. Children born to women over 40 are more likely to have abnormalities, and mothers are more likely to have problems during labour.

Nearly half of all pregnancies in women aged 40 to 42 result in miscarriage. However, the review has come because of concerns in the NHS that the existing age limit could leave clinics open to legal challenges under new age-discrimination laws.

The update, by Government rationing watchdog the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), is also expected to make it easier for couples hoping to start a family to access fertility treatment.

At the moment, couples must have been trying unsuccessfully for a baby for three years before being considered for NHS treatment.

But the recommendations, due to be published on Tuesday, will allow couples access to free IVF after only two years.

A senior source said: ‘The upper age limit for IVF on the NHS is to be increased to 42 and will grant those women one single cycle of IVF.

‘There will also be earlier access to treatment. Instead of waiting for three years, couples will now get through to IVF clinics after unsuccessfully trying for a baby for two years.’

Dr Gedis Grudzinskas, former emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Barts and the Royal London NHS Trust, said the recommendations sent out ‘the wrong message’ and added: ‘Part of this is about taking equality to the extreme to protect those who feel sensitive about accusations of ageism, and that’s a nonsense.

‘Society shouldn’t use this as an excuse to continue to delay looking for Mr Right, and economically speaking the NHS can’t afford it.’

IVF expert Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, said: ‘In biological terms, 35 is actually too late to start trying for a family.

‘What’s important is for society to recognise that couples should start families in their late 20s or early 30s.’

More than 46,000 women had IVF in 2010 and about 40 per cent were NHS patients. Nearly 8,000 were aged between 40 and 42 and would have been treated in the private sector, where clinics set age limits higher than the NHS.

NICE decided to review the guidance to make sure it fully complied with the Equality Act, passed in 2010.

The recommendations are in draft form and will go through a period of consultation until July. The final guidance will not be mandatory and individual NHS trusts can decide not to implement it.

A NICE spokesman said: ‘We cannot comment on speculation on the draft update. Any new recommendations will have been developed according to new evidence published since 2004.’
