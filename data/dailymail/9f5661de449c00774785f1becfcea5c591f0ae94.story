Children visiting a zoo in Poland were left traumatised after seeing the law of the jungle first hand, when a lion killed a lioness.  

Families watched as Arco tore into young lioness Berghi, before gripping her around the throat and choking her to death.

The lions had been brought to the zoo in Gdansk, a city in north-eastern Poland, to mark its 60th anniversary.

Arco had come from a zoo in Portugal, while Berghi and two other lionesses, had been brought over from France.

Anna Malkowska, 28, said at first onlookers thought the lions were 'just having fun'.

She said: 'But then it became very apparent that the male lion was clearly not playing, and suddenly it became like a horror show.

'My daughter started crying and we could see the female lioness was badly bleeding.

Onlookers said it then became 'very apparent that the male lion was clearly not playing, and suddenly it became like a horror show'

'She was kicking her legs to try and get clear and then she stopped moving and was dead.'

Zoo director Michal Targowski said the incident was 'terribly tragic' and the 'most unfortunate incident in the history of the zoo'.

He extended an apology to the families that witnessed it. 

Mr Targowski said the zoo had spent the last few months preparing the enclosure for the lions' arrival 'but we didn't foresee this'.

He added: 'Unfortunately, working with wild animals is always very unpredictable and even with the best preparations things like this can happen.'
