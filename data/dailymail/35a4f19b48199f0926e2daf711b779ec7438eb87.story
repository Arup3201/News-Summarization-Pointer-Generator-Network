Facebook has turned over evidence to police from two profiles set up by a teenager accused of shooting dead his parents and sister in a bid to get his inheritance. 

Alan Hruby, 19, allegedly gunned down his dad John Hruby, 50, mother Tinker Hruby, 48, and his 17-year-old sister Katherine Hruby at their home in Duncan, Oklahoma in October. He later admitted to killing them to get $3,000 to pay off loan sharks.

Posts on his Facebook pages reportedly suggest a dislike for his family, while other messages online boast about his 'shopaholic' habits and his joy at swiping his credit card.

On October 14, the district attorney's chief investigator was granted permission from a judge to collect data from his Facebook pages, the Oklahoman reported. 

Locked up: Alan Hruby, 19, allegedly shot dead his parents and sister in October so that he could get his inheritance to pay off a loan shark. Authorities now have access to his Facebook pages

Victims: He allegedly shot dead his sister Katherine, 17, dad John, 50, and mother Tinker, 48, in their home

The investigator said police had received information that Hruby had posted comments on the page indicating that he didn't like his family - but it is not yet known if these comments were indeed found.

On one of the pages made under the option of 'Public Figure', he called himself 'an up and comer from Oklahoma' who was 'striving for the best life has to offer'.

The 19-year-old college freshman also claimed to be 'represented' by a public relations company in Oklahoma City and a modeling agency in Oklahoma City.

Investigators are likely collecting evidence from Twitter, Instagram and his blog, the Oklahoman reported, but a gagging order is in place so authorities can not share any further details.

Ego: On one of his Facebook pages, the teenager called himself 'an up and comer from Oklahoma'

Social: His other pages, including Instagram, may also be under investigation, according to reports

Cold: After killing his family, he stayed in a hotel and shared images of him and his friends hanging out

In his blog, he described himself as a shopaholic.  

'There is no bigger rush then getting to the register at a store and swiping your credit card,' he wrote.

'And in that moment you are waiting for the screen to say, "Approved", you start to get heart palpitations and you get a rush of adrenaline.

'By the time she is handing your stuff to you, you are so high on adrenaline, the $15,000 total does not even phase you until you've gotten home and seen the receipts.'

Hruby clearly enjoyed the finer things in life - often posting images of expensive trips, drinks and luxury watches and cars to his Instagram page.

Prosecutors have described Hruby as a money-obsessed teen who, by his own admission, 'had been cut off financially … due to an abundance of spending in recent times,' People reported.

It also emerged that he had racked up debts after allegedly pinching his grandmother's credit card, and later used a credit card not belonging to him while he was in Paris.

Money-obsessed: Hruby, who had been financially cut off by his parents, called himself a shopaholic online

Flashy: He shared boastful images online, including this one showing off his watch in front of the Eiffel Tower

Motive: He allegedly told authorities he killed his family for his inheritance to pay off a loan shark

Rap sheet: He was previously in trouble with the cops for using a credit card that wasn't his in Europe

After his arrest for the murder of his family, Hruby said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to pay it off by inheriting money. He said he killed his sister so he would be the sole heir.

His parents had recently cut him off financially, and a search of his dorm room also turned up multiple stolen checks.

Hruby has since been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the October 9 shootings.

On the night of the murders, he made a point a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on his social media accounts.

Hruby then checked into a room at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas while the University of Oklahoma played the University of Texas in a football match nearby - and acted as though nothing had happened.

'Nothing that he said or did ever raised any suspicion from me,' friend Andrew Bormann said.

Victims: His parents, Tinker and John, were shot dead inside their home in Duncan, Oklahoma on October 9

Missed: He killed his sister Katherine, a member of her high school's volleyball team, to be the sole heir

Scene: Their dead bodies were found four days later by a housekeeper at their Oklahoma home, pictured

'Every time I saw him on the weekend, he was happy and laughing and having a good time. Even early Monday morning, 1am, he was laughing and joking with me as we were studying.'  

People started getting concerned about the family when John, the publisher of the local newspaper The Marlow Review, did not show up for work on Friday morning. His wife also worked there.

Mr Hruby also failed to cover the weekly high school football game that he always attends, according to his employees.

A housekeeper eventually found the cold bodies of the family in the kitchen of their home, four days after they were shot dead. 

Hruby is being held without bond. Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty.
