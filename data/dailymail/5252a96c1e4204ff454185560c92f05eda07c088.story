When a Georgia judge sentenced a former General Electric supervisor to life in prison without parole for killing his subordinate's husband outside a preschool, the case seemed far from closed.

That's because the focus of the month-long trial was as much on the victim's wife, Andrea Sneiderman, as it was on the accused.

After Hemy Neuman was found guilty but mentally ill yesterday of the November 2010 murder of Russell 'Rusty' Sneiderman, the question quickly became whether prosecutors would charge her with a crime in her husband's death.

Possible suspect: Now that Neuman has been convicted, all eyes turn to widow Andrea Sneiderman, who could have played a role in her late husband's demise

Neuman's defence attorneys and Russell Sneiderman's family said they hope to see prosecutors investigate Andrea Sneiderman in the killing.

Russell Sneiderman's brother, Steve, said the family has long suspected Andrea was involved in Russell's death, and the trial only confirmed their suspicions.

'Why? What is she hiding? These questions must be answered and answered soon,' he said.

Steve Seniderman added: 'We'll have no peace until everyone involved in Rusty's death is held accountable for their actions. In the meantime it's clear to me that Andrea is covered in Rusty's blood.'

DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James said his office is reviewing the case and, when pressed after the trial on whether imminent charges would be filed related to the victim's wife, he said: 'Stay tuned.'

'Everybody's asking that question,' said Mr James. 'And I'm not going to stand up here and be disingenuous and say that's something that's not being considered.'

Guilty: Hemy Neuman reacts to the verdict today as he faces the prospect of life in prison without parole

Andrea Sneiderman has denied knowing anything about the shooting and her attorney said after the verdict that her client was grateful for the conviction and sentence. She wouldn't comment on the possibility of a criminal investigation.

'Nothing can bring back her husband,' said attorney Jennifer Little, 'but it is reassuring to her that, after all of the noise and distractions surrounding this case, some measure of justice has been done for Rusty.'

Days of testimony during the trial targeted whether Andrea Sneiderman was involved in an affair with Neuman, whether she knew about the details of her husband's death suspiciously early and whether she worked with her former boss to cover it up. This week's closing arguments only ratcheted up the rhetoric.

Attorney Doug Peters, who represented
Neuman, called her a 'tease' who took advantage of Neuman's rapidly 
deteriorating mental state, saying that while his client may have had 
the gun, 'the trigger, I respectfully suggest, was pulled by Andrea 
Sneiderman.' James took it a step further, suggesting that the widow was
a 'co-conspirator.'

'Hemy didn't hide his crime from Andrea because Andrea already knew,' James said in the trial.

J. Tom Morgan, a former DeKalb County
district attorney, said a prosecutor can't ethically accuse anyone of 
the crime to the news media unless that person has been charged, 
indicted or granted immunity.

But that doesn't prevent a prosecutor
from suggesting a witness was involved in a criminal act to a jury as 
long as the evidence backs it up.

'So the D.A. can do something in 
closing he would be prohibited from doing in a press conference,' said 
Morgan, who is now in private practice. 'Whether Robert is going to do 
something with her after the trial is anyone's guess.'

Peters said he's confident his client would testify if charges are brought and she goes to trial.

'I believe that she planted the seed.
I believe that as primed the pump. I believe that as stoked the fire,' 
Peters said. 'And I believe the evidence in the case indicates quite 
clearly that she wanted her husband murdered and that she manipulated 
him.'

Phone records showed Neuman and 
Andrea Sneiderman exchanged multiple phone calls on the eve of her 
husband's death and immediately after the killing.

And while she testified she didn't 
discover her husband had been shot until she reached the hospital about 
an hour after the shooting, her father-in-law and a close friend both 
said she called to deliver the bad news only minutes after he was shot.

Andrea Sneiderman, who has repeatedly
denied being involved in an affair, said she made mistakes by holding 
hands with Neuman, dancing with him at a bar and having long dinners 
with him while on business trips.

But she said she didn't report his 
advances because she feared for her job, and didn't air her suspicions 
that Neuman was involved because it seemed unfathomable.

'The theory that my boss could kill my husband, it seemed kind of stupid at the time,' she testified.

Andrea Sneiderman was hired in early 2010 because her husband was having trouble finding a steady paycheck.

She hit it off with Neuman and the 
two exchanged 1,500 phone calls and text messages in the months before 
the killing. On work trips, they shared intimate dinners and inside 
jokes — and, attorneys say, sexual relations.

Her husband, a Harvard-educated 
entrepreneur who she met in college at Indiana University, was gunned 
down on November 18, 2010 after dropping his two-year-old son off at 
Dunwoody Prep. Police say a bearded man with a hoodie shot him four 
times and sped away in a rented minivan.

Neuman was charged with the crime about six weeks later.

He pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity, saying he couldn't tell the difference between right and wrong
during the shooting.

His lawyers say he fell so hopelessly
in love with Andrea Sneiderman that he believed he was the father of 
her two children and that the only way to protect them was to murder her
husband.

'We'll have no peace until everyone involved in Rusty's death is held accountable for their actions. In the meantime it's clear to me that Andrea is covered in Rusty's blood.'

Prosecutors said Neuman simply wasn't
suffering from a 'made up' mental illness, only jealousy for what he 
couldn't have. A jury agreed, rejecting Neuman's claim that he didn't 
know the difference between right and wrong at the time of the killing.

They found him guilty but mentally 
ill, which means he'll have access to mental health treatment while 
spending his life behind bars.

Some legal experts who have been following the case said there were advantages to charging Neuman but not Andrea Sneiderman.

'The fact she wasn't indicted allowed
her to be called as a witness,' said John Petrey, an ex-DeKalb County 
prosecutor who is now in private practice. 'And from the prosecution's 
point of view it was important that the jury hear and see Andrea 
Sneiderman. Had she been charged they couldn't have done that.'

Petrey said prosecutors may take their
time and develop a strong case that could secure not just an indictment
but also a conviction.

'I'd marshal my best prosecutors and 
see if there's enough to indict and convict Andrea because if they're 
ready to make that leap they would want to be able to quickly take her 
to trial,' he said.

James, the district attorney, said his office will do its best to seek justice for the victim's family.

'It's something we're looking at. I 
know it's important to this family. It's important to America,' James 
said. 'But as a prosecutor I have an obligation to follow the facts ... 
and make a decision that seeks justice.'

Scene of the crime: Randy Sneiderman was shot outside of Dunwoody Daycare Centre outside of Atlanta in 2010

Andrea Sneiderman was hired in early 
2010, and she and Neuman hit it off, exchanging 1,500 phone calls and 
text messages in the months leading up to the killing.

On work trips, they would share long dinners and intimate moments, including sex, according to attorneys.

Neuman didn't testify, but jurors 
heard him through hours of video recordings of interviews with 
investigators and mental health experts.

In one interview, Neuman was asked if he thinks he's the biological father of Sneiderman's two children.

'I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know,' he said. 'I feel like these are my children. I feel like I need 
to be there for them. I feel like I need to raise them and I need to 
protect them. But I don't know.'

Neuman's attorneys tried to portray 
their client as a brilliant but troubled child who was constantly in 
fear of his father, a Holocaust survivor wracked with guilt because he 
was able to escape the death chambers at Auschwitz while many relatives 
died.

Born in Mexico, Neuman was sent to a 
boarding school in Israel and still suffers from fear of being 
abandoned, his attorneys said.

He later landed the GE job that allowed him to buy a pricey home in an upscale Atlanta suburb.

Neuman first tried to kill his rival 
in November 10, 2010, when he camped outside the Sneiderman house with a
gun he recently purchased and waited to attack, prosecutors said.

But he bolted after Russell Sneiderman noticed an intruder on his property and called police.

Eight days later, prosecutors said, 
Neuman arrived at his office much earlier than usual — at 5:36am — then 
sneaked out a back door to avoid security cameras and to give himself an
alibi.

Days later, Neuman went to Russell 
Sneiderman's funeral and even visited Andrea Sneiderman's house for a 
Jewish mourning ceremony, prosecutors said.
