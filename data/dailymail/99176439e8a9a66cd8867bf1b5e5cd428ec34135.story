Tinkerbell and Nemo have long been family favourites as characters on the screen.

But it seems they are now becoming family members - as parents choose them as names for their children.

The Disney characters’ names - from Finding Nemo and Peter Pan - are some of the less traditional monikers given to babies born in 2012.

Characters: Tinkerbell (left) and Nemo (right) are now being chosen by parents as names for their children

Others include Buzz-Bee, Storm, River, Blade, Zico and Diesel. In a few years’ time these youngsters could be listed on a classroom register with Sailor, Wade, Zed and Hendrix.

And they could end up being friends with 
Bliss, Star, Pyper, Kizzie and Buttercup, which have all been recorded 
on birth certificates over the last 12 months.

The unusual names feature on a list compiled by parenting website Bounty.com of names given to the 430,000 babies born in the UK this year.

But traditionalists need not fear, as the most popular names given to both boys and girls sound a great deal more familiar.

In the overall top 100 lists Harry came top for boys with Jack in second and Charlie in third place.

Amelia has overtaken Olivia as the most popular girls’ name with Emily third.

A spokesman for Bounty said yesterday as the lists were released: ‘Parents are being creative and wanting their children to stand out from the crowd with unusual names.

‘Some parents chose unusual names because they don’t want their child to share the same name as others at school. The desire for Classroom "standout" is certainly a growing trend.’

School friends: Sailor, Wade, Zed and Hendrix could end up being in the same class as Bliss, Star, Pyper, Kizzie and Buttercup, which have all been recorded on birth certificates over the last 12 months (file picture)

She continued: ‘The vast majority of parents acknowledge that their children will probably have an easier ride in the playground if they choose a more traditional name, which is why more conservative names such as Harry and Amelia win out overall.’

The most popular names of 2012 in the boys list are Harry, Jack, Charlie, Oliver and Alfie.

The rest of the top ten is made up of Riley, Jacob, James, Thomas and Ethan.

In the girls list Amelia is top followed by Olivia, Emily and Jessica. In fifth place is Sophie closely followed by Lily and Mia. Ava, Isla and Ruby complete the top ten.

The spokesman added: ‘Today’s baby trends change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom.

‘Just a few years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl’s name yet this year they are both in the top ten.

‘Likewise for boys, there is a growing trend for ‘old man’ names, especially those that are given a contemporary spin by using the nickname for the traditional variation like Alfie, Archie, Bobby, Charlie, Frankie and Freddy.

‘Generally speaking, whatever name a child is given they usually grow up to make it their own.’
