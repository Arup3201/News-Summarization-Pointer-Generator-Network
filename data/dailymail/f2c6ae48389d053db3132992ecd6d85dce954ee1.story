Crowds of families lined the shore to welcome home warship HMS Defender in time for Christmas after a six month deployment supporting US air strikes against Isis.

The Royal Navy warship sailed into Portsmouth Naval Base, Hampshire, this morning after its posting to the northern Gulf where it used its air defence capabilities to back the US-led carrier task group.

Children waved flags and banners to welcome home the sailors as they ran down the gangplank and the Portsmouth Military Wives Choir added to the festive atmosphere by performing carols.

The Type 45 destroyer clocked up more than 35,000 nautical miles since leaving the UK in June and her crew missed Christmas last year after being called up to track a Russian naval task force.

Commanding officer Phil Nash said: 'The homecoming is a special day for my ship's company to be extremely proud of their achievements and the delivery of a hugely successful maiden operational deployment.

'Some have been with Defender from build and have seen the ship grow from an engineering project to become one of the world's most capable air defenders deployed on operations.

'Today is a special day and one to recognise the support of our families and friends who play an enormous part in everything we do. Without them these continued successes would not have been possible.'

The Defender's maiden deployment included counter piracy patrols in the Gulf and operations in the Mediterranean.
