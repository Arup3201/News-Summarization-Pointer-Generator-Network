He's famous for his unique brand of high-octane Italian glamour but it would seem that Roberto Cavalli's fashionable vision doesn't extend past the end of the catwalk.

The 72-year-old designer was spotted wearing a pair of ancient frayed denim cut-offs while enjoying the sunshine on a trip aboard a yacht in Capri.

The elderly shorts appear to be a favourite and were first pictured being worn by the fashion supremo during a trip to Sardinia two years ago.

Cavalli, who is famous for his love of colourful animal print and bling details, was joined by his much-younger girlfriend Lina Nilson who looked tanned and relaxed as she laughed with the fashion mogul.

Twenty-something Nilson did manage to add a shot of glamour to the scene courtesy of a chic leopard print bikini which she teamed with a tight black vest and huge dark sunglasses.

Both were wreathed in smiles as they laughed and hugged each other, interspersed with the occasional glance at the spectacular surrounding scenery.

The twosome were joined by friends and their Alsatian dog, who has become a regular sight on board Cavalli's yacht.

The pampered pooch, who also joined the couple on a trip to Sardinia earlier this year, was petted and cuddled by Nilson before being given a partly deflated football to play with.

This could be the last holiday the pair enjoy for some time, thanks to the fast-approaching Milan Fashion Week.

Cavalli's newest collection - spring/summer 2014 - is due to hit the catwalk in less than four weeks from now.
