Western Sydney Wanderers’ captain Nikolai Topor-Stanley has laughed off accusations of match fixing, saying the club thoroughly deserved their historic win in the Asian Champions League.

The 29-year-old defender tells Daily Mail Australia that allegations from the losing side, Al-Hilal, do not bother the team, who know to ignore the poor sportsmanship because ‘as sad as it is, (this type of behaviour) is football.’

‘It’s sad, but it happens everywhere. You have to choose to react or not to react to it and our team does not buy into that stuff,’ said Topor-Stanley.

The three-year-old Sydney side won the competition on aggregate after a 0-0 draw with Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, crowned champions due to their 1-0 victory in Sydney the week prior.

Ugly scenes ensued, with Al-Hilal striker head butting and later spitting on Wanderers defender Matthew Spiranovic, and goalkeeper Ante Covic having lasers flashing in eyes from the crowd during the match.

On Tuesday, Al-Hilal officials released a letter, claiming the club lost unfairly due to poor decision-making from the referee, alleging four incorrect judgements cost their side the game.

Topor-Stanley, who returned to Australia with his team on Tuesday, says the team is taking little notice of the poor sportsmanship.

‘We deserve the win and we have the medal to prove it. Nobody can take that away from us,’ Topor-Stanley told Daily Mail Australia.

‘The accusations don’t bother me one bit. Nobody can say we weren’t deserving players.’

‘This win is for them. This win is for the supporters. They are as much a part of it as every player and staff member,’ said the WSW captain

‘The true mark of a champion is that the whole club gave their utmost to win.’

Firmly focused on the A-League season, the Wanderers are shrugging off the controversy, well-aware that a ‘winning’ attitude is crucial for 'more success' going forward.

‘Our team doesn’t buy into that stuff. It will only distract you,’ said Topor-Stanley.

‘We’re a winning club. Our success is built on a winning mentality.'

‘Our team is built on trying to be the best everyday.’

Hard work is deeply ingrained in the captain’s character, with Topor-Stanley spending the afternoon as he flew into Sydney studying for a university exam scheduled for the next day.

Understandably, he is feeling a little less-than prepared, but makes no excuses.

In fact, the entire club’s celebrations must wait, as they prepare for Friday night’s A-League fixture against Wellington Phoenix in New Zealand.

The Western Sydney Wanderers' fans, known for being the loudest supporters in the Hyundai A league, showed up at Sydney airport on Tuesday to welcome the players home from their recent AFC win

Losing side Al-Hilal continue to lash out after losing the Asian Champions League final to the Western Sydney Wanderers, claiming the win is a 'black spot in the history of Asian football'

Western Sydney Wanderers have become the first A-League side to win the Asian Champions League

The final was played in front of a full capacity King Fahd stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Of the 70,000-person crowd, only 14 Wanderers' fans were able to make the journey, meaning Al-Hilal's loss was witnessed by a sea of their blue and white supporters

The memory of the roaring crowd is still fixed in Topor-Stanley’s mind, explaining that the ‘literally deafening, amazing amount of noise’ was like nothing he had ever experienced.

The team played in front of a full-capacity, 70,000 person crowd at King Fahd stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Only fourteen of those spectators were Western Sydney Wanderers supporters.

Yet playing to a sea of blue and white was far from intimidating.

‘It was energising to see all the Al-Hilal supporters.'

‘It wasn’t scary or daunting, it made us realise that this is the big time and this is where we belong.'

‘We earned the right to play at this level and it didn’t intimate us.’

The team leader says this self-belief and the Wanderers’ strong team culture is the key to their incredible success, just three years since the club’s formation.

‘We want to win and we apply that mentality to every game,’ explains Topor-Stanley

'Dreams do come true,' said celebrated coach, Tony Popovic, who had lead the three-year-old side to victory

The square erupted when the Wanderers secured the win, with fans setting off flares, waving flags and 'sobbing' out of happiness

‘It’s easy to say that, I mean, everybody wants to win. But not everybody is willing to sacrifice consistently.'

‘Our entire team is committed everyday. Every player, the coaches and everyone in the staff is on the same page.'

‘People don’t see that side, they just see the 90 minutes we play. Our club culture brought us to where we are.’

The captain says the team is ecstatic after their win, which is still yet to sink in.

‘I feel complete disbelief. It’s been very emotional,’ said Topor Stanley.

‘I’ve been remembering all the things that my parents sacrificed when I was growing up which gave me the opportunity to play in that game. I’m so grateful.’

Thousands of ecstatic, boisterous fans were at the ready to welcome the Wanderers back to Australia after their historic triumph

‘This win is for them. This win is for the supporters. They are as much a part of it as every player and staff member,’ said Topor-Stanley.

‘We couldn’t have done it without them. They are a part of the club.’

The players are well aware that the hard work is far from behind them, with the fifth round of the Hyundai A-League just days away.

‘(The ACL win) is a huge confidence boost, but we’re well aware we have zero points in the league at the moment.

‘We’re not in denial about that, we’re behind the eight-ball and we need to catch up.’

‘It’s a huge task but we’re not panicking and we’re not going to change anything. We’re just going to go out and do what we’ve always done and give everything.’
