A stuttering Asda worker who claims he was sacked over his speech impediment launched a campaign of harassment against a colleague an employment tribunal heard today.

Adnan Malik accused the supermarket giant of discriminating against his disability after it sacked him for talking 'aggressively' and gesticulating in front of customers.

The 30-year-old claims the unusual behavior was simply the product of frustration at his inability to get the words out but today his employers hit back.

Other side: Stuttering Asda worker Adnan Malik was accused of a string of escalating instances of bullying and harassment against his cousin Amna Sarwar, who was also his colleague

Mr Malik was accused of a string of escalating instances of bullying and harassment against his cousin Amna Sarwar, who was also his colleague, culminating in a complaint made to the police.

All three confrontations between the pair took place inside the store, in Reading, Berkshire, and after the second he was advised to stay away from his relative by the police.

The tribunal heard how Ms Sarwar, who was based on the shop floor and check-out, worked a different shift pattern to the store assistant, meaning their paths need not have crossed.

Manager Stephen Chamberlain, who dismissed Mr Malik, told the tribunal his employee might have escaped the axe had he not gone back a third time.

He said: 'He was dismissed because of this act of intimidation and bullying.He continued going back when he shouldn’t have done.

'Irrespective of the shouting and the gesticulating issue it would have been dismissal anyway.'

He added: 'Amna was used to his language and body language. For her to feel so upset that she had to go to the police, we inferred that it was a serious conflict.'

A family feud spilled over into the pair’s working lives when the married father-of-two walked into the branch in July, last year, while he was meant to be on holiday.

After an initial confrontation he left the store only to return later in an agitated state and he approached Ms Sarwar talking loudly and aggressively, the tribunal heard.

However, the dispute reached its peak when he appeared inside the branch a third time several days later when she claims he threatened to 'chop her up'.

Another witness, who mistook him for a customer, stated he had been aggressive and threatening.

Mr Malik denies harassing Ms Sarwar and says his loud voice was simply an attempt to express himself as he struggled against his stutter.

Out of work: Since his dismissal from Asda, Mr Malik has been out of work and claiming Job Seeker's allowance

He said: 'He dismissed me because I raised my voice, that is not under my control.

'When I talk with someone, in order to continue the conversation, I have to raise my voice because that helps me.

'I spent seven-and-a-half years with this company. People know me, all my colleagues understand I have to raise my voice.

'Customers don’t know me. The customers think I’m shouting. I’m raising my voice but I’m talking normally.'

Mr Malik appealed the sacking decision and produced a letter from his GP confirming he suffered from the long term problem and had attempted speech therapy to no avail.

The tribunal panel was told that the father-of-two’s stutter got worse the more stressed he got and he sometimes gesticulated and moved his body as he struggled to speak.

When he approached his cousin, who was working at a check-out till at the same branch, he said he was afflicted with the stutter and could not squeeze out the words he wanted to say.

The store assistant began to gesticulate and his actions scared a nearby customer who, oblivious to his disability, told managers he was shouting and being aggressive, the tribunal heard.

The store assistant claims that owing to a family feud his cousin turned on him, claiming he had threatened to 'chop her up' - a claim completely absent from the customer’s complaint.

Since his dismissal Mr Malik has been out of work and claiming Job Seeker’s allowance.

The hearing continues.
