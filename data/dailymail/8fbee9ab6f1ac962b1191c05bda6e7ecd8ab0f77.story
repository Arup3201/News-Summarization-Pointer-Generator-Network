Ricky Burns has been handed the chance to revive his career in the United States with a clash against fellow former world champion Omar Figueroa.

Burns will take on the unbeaten 25-year-old in San Antonio, Texas on May 9 in his first fight in the States.

Figueroa vacated his WBC lightweight title in November after suffering an infected cut in his second successful defence against Daniel Estrada, with the Venezuelan subsequently deciding to step up a weight.

Burns is looking to bounce back from a difficult period which saw him lose his WBO lightweight belt to Terence Crawford.

The two-weight world champion lost his comeback fight against Dejan Zlaticanin and the Coatbridge fighter then came back with an eight-round points win over Frenchman Alexandre Lepelley in Leeds on his debut at light-welterweight level in October.

Promoter Eddie Hearn said: 'This is a wonderful opportunity for Ricky. I've always felt that Burns versus Figueroa would be a fight of the year contender and now it's made. 

'Ricky is so motivated for this fight, it's live on CBS in the States, Sky Sports in the UK; it doesn't get much bigger.'
