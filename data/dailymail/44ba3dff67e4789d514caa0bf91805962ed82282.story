A 29-year-old woman has drowned after she tried to rescue her dog before the animal managed to make its way to shore and survive.

Sabra Crafton, from Cashmere, Washington, began to struggle in the water at a public fishing hole east of Dryden, a male friend told the Chelan County Sheriff's Office after he tried to reach her.

The friend told the sheriff he nearly 
brought Miss Crafton back to shore on Monday afternoon when she broke free to 
make another attempt to rescue her dog.

The sheriff's office said a kayaker later located Miss Crafton submerged in the Wenatchee River  near a Cashmere bridge.

Nearby rafters were able to pull her out of the water and onto their raft. They began CPR and took her to a beach, where ambulance medics and firefighters tried for nearly 30 minutes to revive her.

She was not wearing a life jacket.

The friend told dispatchers that he and Crafton had been on the shoreline, tossing a stick for the dog to fetch out of the water. She jumped in when the dog began to struggle in the river.
