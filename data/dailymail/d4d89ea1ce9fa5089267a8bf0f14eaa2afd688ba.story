The search for a Mississippi toddler and her parents who went missing after their younger daughter was discovered dead ended early Thursday morning when the child was found safe in Georgia.

Lowndes County Chief Deputy Marc Miley says 2-year-old Maliah Harris disappeared with Allison Studdard, 31, and 34-year-old Donald Harris Wednesday morning.

Late Wednesday night, the toddler was tracked down to the town of Sylvester in southern Georgia. Her parents were taken into custody.

Taken: Police issued an Amber Alert for Studdard and Harris' 2-year-old daughter, Maliah, who was whisked away by her parents

The family took off shortly after their 
7-month-old child, Alyssa, was discovered dead by a relative in their 
Caledonia home early this morning. 

County Coroner Greg Merchant says there were no visible signs of injury to the infant. An autopsy is being conducted to determine a cause of death.

According to reports, methamphetamine and ice were found in the family's Caledonia residence.

The Mississippi Highway Patrol issued an Amber Alert for Maliah and her parents.

Patrol spokesman Warren Strain says they were last seen traveling in a black or brown 2002 Pontiac Aztec with Georgia license plate PGR7927.

According 
to Miley, the girl's grandfather came upon Alyssa's lifeless body inside
 their home in the 1800 block of Honnoll Mill Road at around 5.30am, The Dispatch reported.

According to Mrs Studdard's online profile, she enrolled last year in Mississippi University for Women in Columbus, Mississippi, to study accounting. 

On her Google+ page, the 31-year-old mother of two listed her occupation as online reseller.
