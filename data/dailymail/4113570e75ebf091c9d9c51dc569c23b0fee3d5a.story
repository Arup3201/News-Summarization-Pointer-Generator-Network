A four-year-old girl has survived a horrific eight-storey fall from a Gold Coast hotel, slipping over the balcony while playing hide and seek with a babysitter.

The little girl was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from the Phoenician Resort in a serious but stable condition, undergoing surgery for a broken leg on Thursday night.

A witness, who saw the little girl's fall explains to investigators what he saw from the ninth floor balcony the four-year-old fell from

The four-year-old girl miraculously survived the 25 metre fall from ninth floor unit to a hedge on the first level

She also suffered abdominal injuries when she landed in a hedge after plunging 25 metres from her ninth floor unit.

It's understood the child was 'playing games' with a babysitter and her parents were not present. 

Investigators are relieved that the little girl fell in the hedge. She escaped with only minor injuries, including a broken leg and abdominal injuries, thanks to the garden bed that broke her fall

Witnesses heard a loud thud and then saw the little girl crawling out from the garden, according to Nine News.

It’s reported the child, who landed on the first floor pool deck, was dazed and not crying. She miraculously escaped with only minor injuries.

Police have launched an investigation, with the Child Protection Investigation Unit investigating the circumstances that led up to the accident.

‘Police have attended the Gold Coast University Hospital and also the incident scene at Broadbeach to conduct a preliminary inquiry,’ Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia.

The little girl was playing hide-and-seek with her babysitter at the time of her fall. She is believed to be on holidays on the Gold Coast from Asia with her parents

However, early findings indicate the situation is non-suspicious.

‘It appears to be an accident at this stage but we are conducting a thorough investigation,’ chief detective Inspector Mark White told news.com.au.

‘She is a very lucky little girl, we’re just so thankful that she landed in the hedge and that she's ok.’
