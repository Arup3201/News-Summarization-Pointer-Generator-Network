Just moments before the hostage situation at Martin Place began, police announced the arrest of two Sydney men  as part of a major counter-terrorism investigation.

At least thirteen people are currently being held hostage by at least one armed gunman at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place - a major business, legal and media centre in Sydney's central business district.

The Australian Federal Police apprehended a 25-year-old terror suspect in Beecroft in Sydney's leafy north-western suburbs this morning, reportedly as he was leaving a prayer hall. 

Seven News identified one arrested man as Ali Al Talibi but police would not confirm this information to Daily Mail Australia.

A NSW police spokeswoman said there was 'nothing to indicate [a link between the two incidents] at this stage'.

In a statement early this morning, the Federal Police said the suspect was taken into custody 'as part of continuing investigations into the planning of a terrorist attack on Australian soil'.

The investigation also concerned the 'facilitation of travel of Australian citizens to Syria to engage in armed combat'.

Another man is understood to have already been in custody. 

Many shaking and sobbing witnesses have been seen pressed up against the glass windows of the cafe along with a black flag featuring white Islamic writing. 

Radio 2GB host Ray Hadley has reported the hostagetaker 'is telling negotiators he has got control of the city'. 

The Sydney Opera House was evacuated and the Prime Minister announced the National Security Committee had been convened in Canberra.

'It's a very fluid situation at the moment,' an AFP spokesman told Daily Mail Australia this morning. 

The AFP has cancelled plans to hold a press conference about the raids.

In September, Australia witnessed the largest terror raids the country has ever seen with more than 800 police officers involved in operations across the Sydney basin.
