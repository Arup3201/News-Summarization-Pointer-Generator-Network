A young woman from Alaska has been hailed a hero after she lifted her boyfriend’s foot from the accelerator of their car and grabbed the steering wheel when he was killed by a mystery object.

Quick-thinking Danielle Oylear, 26, prevented a serious accident after the object smashed through the windscreen, striking Rutger Hale, 22, in the head as they drove in New Zealand.

The object flew through the interior of the car and smashed out through the back window. But after a search of the lonely road between Hawea and Wanaka, in the south island, police remain mystified as to what it was.

Detective Sergeant Brian Cameron said Miss Oylear had done a ‘remarkable job’ in the seconds after Mr Hale, from Auckland, was killed.

‘She has had to take control of the vehicle, grabbing the steering wheel while attempting to lift the driver’s foot from the accelerator,' he said.

‘She’s done a remarkable job of steering the vehicle to its final resting place without being involved in a secondary crash’ Detective Cameron told the Otago Daily Times.

Miss Oylear, whom Mr Hale called Deezy Dee, was in the front passenger seat when the incident occurred.

Police said Mr Hale had been working as a farm hand and the couple were staying at a holiday park near Lake Hawea. The popular New Zealander had recently returned to his home country after a road trip around America.

His Facebook page revealed he had bought a Jeep while in the U.S. and visited a number of  states, include Alaska, and Miss Oylear's home town of Anchorage. 

They revealed their excitement about returning to New Zealand when Mr Hale wrote on Facebook: ‘Let the count down begin. Aotearoa [the Maori name for New Zealand] here I come.’

Miss Oylear applied for a New Zealand work visa and traveled across the Pacific to her boyfriend’s home country.

Last night she was staying with Mr Hale’s family where she was said to be trying to come to terms with her boyfriend’s death.

New life: The couple had recently moved to New Zealand after meeting while Rutger was driving round the U.S.

Police said they did not know what had smashed a fist-sized hole in the windscreen of the couple’s blue Subaru car, despite two days of searching.

Detective Cameron said: ‘We do not have any evidence that suggests that there is anything sinister or suspicious about this crash but we need to work to piece together the logical parts of the puzzle to establish how it occurred.’
