Doll face: 200,000 people in Iran are having nose jobs each year to mimic the western look

Young women in Iran, some as young as 14, are having cosmetic surgery in the hope of attaining the Hollywood 'doll face'.

Iran has been named the nose job capital of the world - with seven times more operations carried out there than in America - despite the high cost of the surgery.

Cosmetic procedures cost five to six times the average monthly wage in Iran but according to a report in their 
conservative Etemad newspaper, as many as 200,000 Iranians are undergoing rhinoplasty operations every year.

The reasons behind the surgery include self-esteem and marriageability, as well as medical issues and the fact that some women in the country find the Islamic practice of the hijab so limiting when it comes to beauty.

One woman told The Guardian: 'It's human nature to want to seek out attention with a beautiful figure, hair, skin â€¦ but hijab doesn't let you do that.

'So we have to satisfy that instinct by displaying our 'art' on our faces.'

The newspaper also reported concerns that the surge in demand has led to a huge increase in unlicensed practioners and means that some people are putting their health at risk in their quest for a new face.

In Tehran there are only 157 licensed plastic surgeons but there are 7,000 unlicensed surgeons.

Problems associated with botched procedures include respiratory problems, the nose being 
dented or malformed, 
sinus pain and congestion during the winter months, growth of extra 
tissue or bone, and loss of the sense of smell.

The prohibitive price has meant that some are also taking out bank loans, often under deception, to fund the surgery.

But the risks are not putting people off.

The Rhinology Research Society of 
Iran who conducted the study in co-operation with Johns Hopkins 
University in the US found that the rate of nose jobs per capita is 
seven times that of America and as prevalent in the the Islamicrepublic 
as it is in Brazil.

Another anonymous Iranian woman who had a nose job not long ago told The Guardian: 'I do have
 a better social life and I don't have to be ashamed of my big, fat nose
 anymore.

'In our family, different types of 
cosmetic surgery are a totally normal thing, and most of the women and 
girls have had their noses done.'

While there are benefits, she confesses 'when I get a cold, I get a runny nose - something fierce. I have to be careful then'.
