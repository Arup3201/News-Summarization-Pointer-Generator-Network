The 25-year-old British tourist, who died after slipping off a 90-metre cliff over the weekend, was a well-known professional BASE jumper.

Tributes have streamed in for Gareth Jones, who fell to his death after climbing over a fence at North Head near Manly at about 6:45am on Sunday morning.

Only a few months before his tragic death, the extreme sportsman whose Facebook displays footage from a variety of his international jumps, leaped from the top of the Menara Tower in Kuala Lumpar.

BASE jumper Gareth Jones died on Sunday morning after falling from a 90 metre cliff at Sydney's northern beaches

The 25-year-old's Facebook page displays footage from dozens of BASE jumps that Mr Jones had completed all over the world

'Survived KL with an amazing crew of people! What an epic adventure that was,' Mr Jones had written of the event.

Months earlier, photographs show the adventure-thirsty tourist jumping into canyons in Australia.

But it was a casual stroll in Sydney's northern beaches that led to Mr Jones' death on the weekend, when he and a few friends walked to the edge of the cliff to watch the sunrise.

Mr Jones is then believed to have accidentally slipped before plummeting to his death.

A number of his friends have taken to social media to pay respect to a 'beautiful soul' and 'proper mate', many writing: 'fly free'.

None of the messages were as poignant as the tribute posted by Echo Giesel Widmer however, who described the 25-year-old as 'wild child' who 'wanted to be free'.

'He was loud the day I met him, and he was loud the last day I hugged him and squeezed him before saying goodbye. He was never boring, he always challenged the norm. He made every moment more fun, and exciting. He pulled everyone out of their comfort zones and just let go,' Ms Widmer wrote.

'Ironically he told me and some others a week ago that when he died, he'd be p***** if his friends had a funeral and cried for him. He said he wanted to have a Viking Funeral and he wanted his friends to send him out to sea on a burning ship while celebrating and partying in the moonlight. Gareth wasn't afraid of what the future may bring, he just wanted to live.'

The friends were sitting on the cliff's edge to watch the sunrise when tragedy struck, Inspector Nigel Taylor told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'When they returned to the lookout, the young fella has gone to have a closer look and fallen over the edge,' Inspector Taylor said.

Two of the friends allegedly climbed down the cliff to reach him with the use of ropes and ladders that are normally used by fisherman, but they found their friend was unresponsive, according to Nine News.

Police, who have not yet confirmed Mr Jones's identity, retrieved Mr Jones' body from the cliff base at 11.30am.

'It looks like a tragic accident and we feel for all of the people that were there and obviously our thoughts will be with his family when we inform them,' Inspector Belinda Caddy told Nine News.

The clifftops at North Head are well known for the panoramic view they show of Sydney Harbour and skyline, and are a popular tourist destination on the northern beaches.

Police have issued a serious warning to people who visit such lookouts and coastal areas.

For their own safety, citizens have been told that they must never climb over fences and into restricted areas as they will be at risk of serious injury or death.
