An Indiana couple facing jail time for nursing an injured fawn back to health rather than leaving it to die could be granted a reprieve.

The Department of Natural Resources has said that it will ask that charges be dismissed against Jeff and Jennifer Counceller, who were charged with the illegal possession of a deer.

The couple were each charged and faced 60 days in jail and a $500 fine after they rescued the wounded fawn they named Little Orphan Dani and kept it for two years on their 17-acre farm.

Connersville police officer Jeff Counceller says he discovered the tiny deer curled up on a neighbor’s front porch, badly wounded and unable to stand, while he was on patrol two years ago.

Without time to help it himself, he called his wife, a registered nurse, who cautiously approached the deer with their teenager daughter before the fawn gently licked their hands.

Unbeknownst to them at the time, however, was that bringing the animal home with them was illegal according to the state's Department of Natural Resources, with the crime punishable by jail.

But news of the charges prompted a massive outpouring of online support for the couple, and an online petition demanding the charged be dropped received more than 30,000 signatures.

'I had hopes that it would come out this way because it was obvious that much of the world saw the compassion of what we did and there was not criminal intent,' Jennifer Counceller told the IndyStar.

Gov. Mike Pence asked the agency to reevaluate the case, and investigators asked the prosecutor to dismiss the charges.

The Decatur County Prosecuting Attorney's office said it was waiting a statement from the DNR about where it stands on the case before going forward.

When Mrs Councellor first saw the deer in 2010, she described it as having puncture wounds along its hips from a possible coyote attack. The wounds she said were maggot infested. If they left the animal there it would surely die, she reasoned.

They called the DNR, who told them to take the animal out into the woods and leave it there.

'She would have laid there and starved to death and had a miserable death,' Mrs Connersville told the IndyStar.

Instead they took the animal back to 
their 17-acre farm and began caring for her, starting with a small 
bottle of goats milk, while giving her the name of Little Orphan Dani.

The
Councellers said the charges came after a six-month investigation by 
the department which included a half a dozen visits to their home and 
calls to local authorities.

The family says they didn’t know at 
the time that it was illegal to keep the deer. The DNR offered to 
euthanize the deer, who was said to be posing a safety threat to humans.

‘I
was devastated,’ Mrs Counceller told ABC of her reaction. ‘I spent a 
year and several months nursing her into adulthood, getting to the point
where she was able to go out on her own. No matter what the law is, we did what was right for the animal.'

But on the day of Dani's scheduled execution they found the deer gone. The door to her outdoor enclosure was found hanging open.

An incident report filed by the DNR lists Jennifer Counceller’s 80-year-old father as a suspect in the animal’s release, but that’s an allegation Mrs Counceller says they cannot prove.

The family says they didn't have a hand in Dani's escape but admit that they also didn't try too hard to find out how it happened.

Mr Counceller only reasons that Dani had a good number of friends: 'She was very popular.'
