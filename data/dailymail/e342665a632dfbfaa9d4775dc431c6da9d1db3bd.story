Bernie Ecclestone insisted that he remains 'confident' as he arrived in court in Munich for the start of his bribery trial, which could see him jailed for 10 years.

The Formula One ringmaster arrived by car on Thursday morning and was later pictured flanked by his legal team, lawyers Sven Thomas and Norbert Scharf, in the courtroom prior to proceedings.

And the 83-year-old billionaire even cracked a joke about his personal life at the start of proceedings.

The result of the bribery case will 
shape the future of Formula One, the billion-dollar sport Ecclestone has
 controlled for close on 40 years.

At the heart of the 256-page 
indictment against Ecclestone is the accusation that he paid a bribe of 
£27million to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to maintain his control 
over Formula One.

Prosecutors
 say that Gribkowsky therefore steered the sale of the sport to CVC, a 
private equity firm that had agreed to retain Ecclestone as F1’s chief 
executive when they bought a majority shareholding in 2006.

Ecclestone,
 83, denies the accusation, saying he gave money to Gribkowsky to stop 
him making false claims about his tax affairs. Gribkowsky was sentenced 
to eight-and-a-half years in prison in 2012.

Ecclestone has denied wrongdoing and said he was 'shaken down' because Gribkowsky was effectively blackmailing him.

'I'm confident, the sun is shining,' a dark-suited Ecclestone told camera crews jostling to film his entry into the Munich courtroom.

With an interpreter at his side, he confirmed the pronunciation of his name and his date of birth to judge Peter Noll.

Ecclestone, who married for a third 
time in 2012 to a Brazilian woman more than 40 years his junior, 
prompted laughter in the court when asked to clarify initial confusion 
over his marital status.

'I like to remember the divorce part,' he said in English.

He is accused of giving a $45m (£27.5m; 33m euros) bribe to a German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to secure the sale of a stake in the F1 business to a company he favoured. 

The allegation is that by securing the sale of the stake to a company Mr Ecclestone favoured, he would remain in charge of Formula 1 and its commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals.

Mr Ecclestone admits paying Gerhard Gribkowsky, who is serving a jail sentence for receiving the payment, but has denied any wrongdoing.

He says it was a 'shake down' as the banker had been threatening to reveal false details of his tax affairs.

The
 levity was short-lived as the prosecution read out the details of its 
case that he channelled $44 million to former BayernLB banker Gribkowsky
 for having helped to safeguard his position as head of Formula One.

The
 case is due to last until September 16, though the court will sit only 
one or two days a week. This will allow Ecclestone to continue to run 
F1.

At the age of 83, Ecclestone has already made tentative noises with regard to a succession plan, stating last month he has been looking over the past few years for someone to assist and then take over.

If found guilty, even if Ecclestone avoids jail time and is instead punished with a severe financial penalty, the writing is on the wall.

Donald Mackenzie, co-chairman of F1's current majority shareholders CVC Capital Partners, has already stated Ecclestone will be sacked if convicted.

It is understood CVC have tentative plans in place for the worst-case scenario, although they have yet to be revealed.
