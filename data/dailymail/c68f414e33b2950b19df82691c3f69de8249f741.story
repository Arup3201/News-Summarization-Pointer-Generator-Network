More than £2.5million
 has been spent getting rid of over 100 government officials only for 
them to be rehired, MailOnline can reveal.

It confirms that Whitehall’s lucrative revolving door has continued to turn despite the age of austerity.

The
 revelation will raise fresh questions about the ability of the civil 
service to manage staffing numbers when they are supposed to be making 
major savings.

Return: Dozens of people laid off by government departments since 2010 have been rehired

Since May 2010 at least 106 people 
have retired or been made redundant from government departments with pay-offs worth 
at least £2.563million before being re-employed.

The
 Ministry of Defence alone spent £1.6million paying-off 44 staff who 
have been rehired, while the Foreign Office the bill was a total of 
£647,840 rehiring 14 people and the Department for Transport shelled out
 £315,000 on 10 which went back to work there.

The true scale of the bill could be much higher because several government departments refused to give details of the pay-outs.

Labour
 shadow transport minister Lilian Greenwood, who obtained the figures, 
said: ‘This is just the latest example of how the Government’s 
incompetence is wasting money.

Labour frontbencher Lilian Greendwood condemned the 'shambles' of departments rehiring people they had laid off

‘Taxpayers
 will be outraged that at least £2.5 million has spent on paying off 
civil servants, only for them to be rehired at great expense.

‘Ministers
 seem to be stumbling from crisis to crisis while failing to deliver the
 major projects that the country needs. The taxpayer shouldn’t be 
footing the bill for this latest shambles.’

William
 Hague's Foreign Office has rehired 14 people who had already retired. 
Eight of them received a total of £647,840.06 before being asked back.

Foreign
 Office minister Hugh Robertson said: ‘Individual payments are 
calculated in accordance with the civil service pension scheme rules in 
place at the time of retirement and are based on salary, years of 
service and age.’

The 
Ministry of Defence said that of some 10,000 civilian staff to have left
 under a Voluntary Early Release Scheme, of 44 have been re-employed.

Between
 them they received lump sums totalling £1.6million to leave before 
going back. Only one had to repay their redundancy money.

Defence
 minister Andrew Murrison said: ‘We have saved taxpayers some £2.2 
billion from a 15 per cent reduction in the civil service which is now 
at its smallest since the second world war.’

Under
 the Civil Service Compensation Scheme, only staff who are re-employed 
within 28 days have to return all of their redundancy package.

If an employee has been out of the civil service for more than six months before returning they pay back nothing.

Philip Hammond's Ministry of Defence has rehire 
44 people it spent £1.6million making redundant while William Hague's 
Foreign Office rehired 14 people who received a total of £647,840 when 
retiring

The
 Department of Health has already faced criticism for the huge number of
 NHS staff paid off as a result of its controversial reorganisation only
 to turn up in other health service roles.

More than 3,200 NHS bureaucrats were handed redundancy pay-offs before walking into new jobs in the Health Service.

Husband
 and wife Chris Reed and Karen Straughair received six-figure pay-offs 
from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

Another
 manager, Rob Cooper, received at least £370,000 to leave on job but 
already had another role lined up at a different health trust.

Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got 
jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust

At the DoH itself one member 
of staff who was made redundant was rehired 16 months later, although 
health minister Daniel Poulter insisted they were paid less than before.

The
 Home Office said it has re-employed 23 staff who retired from the 
Department since May 2010, most of whom are part of the frontline 
seasonal work force.

The 
Department for Work and Pensions has reemployed nine people which it had
 laid off, two people have been re-employed at the Department for Energy
 and Climate Change, three at the Department for International 
Development.

The Cabinet Office refused to give details of the number of people rehired because the number was lower than five.

A
 Government spokesman said: ‘The Government reformed the Compensation 
Scheme in 2010 so as to reduce costs and to require the recovery of 
compensation payments where staff are dismissed and re-employed.

‘Across Government, savings from work force reductions have resulted in savings of £2.2 billion compared to 2009-10.’
