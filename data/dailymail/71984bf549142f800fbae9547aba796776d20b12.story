A lodger wanted in connection with the killings of his landlady and her elderly mother  was arrested on suspicion of their murders yesterday.

Barry Morrow, 51, had last been seen arriving in Calais hours after the bodies of Avon lady Angela Holgate, 54, and Alice Huyton, 75,  were found on Saturday. They had been asphyxiated.

The engineer had been using Facebook to say he was in touch with police and proclaim: ‘INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.’ He also hired a solicitor.

Investigation: Merseyside Police have arrested Barry Morrow, 51, on suspicion of murder today and he is currently being quizzed by police

Police sources today said that he has been arrested in the UK.

A
spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police have arrested a
51-year-old man from Southport on suspicion of the murder of Alice 
Huyton and Angela Holgate in Fairhaven Road, Southport.

'He will be questioned by detectives today.'

Avon lady Angela Holgate and her mother were found by a relative at Mrs Holgate's home on Saturday evening.

Post-mortem examinations have shown that both women died from asphyxiation.

Mrs Huyton had been married to her husband Jim for 55 years, with Angela their only daughter.

Murdered: Angela Holgate, 54, was discovered dead at her home, along with her mother Alice Huyton, 75, right

Mrs
Huyton's son John - brother to Mrs Holgate - said the family was 
'bewildered and devastated at the loss of two very special people'.

He said: 'Both Alice and Angela were very popular and led active lives and had many friends.

'They
meant so much in the eyes of different family members and held the 
roles of: great-grandmother, grandmother, mother, wife, aunty, sister 
and sister-in-law. The sad loss has had a severe impact on the whole 
family.'

Mr Morrow was last 
seen in Calais at 7.20pm on Saturday, after apparently catching a ferry 
across the Channel with Mrs Holgate's white Citroen, registration PN11 
RWK.

Mrs Huyton was last seen on Friday evening when she left her home in Southport to visit her daughter.

Probe: Forensic officers investigate the house where the bodies of two women were found in Southport late on Saturday afternoon

Divorced
Mrs Holgate, the mother of two adult daughters, had been ill and had 
not been seen out of the house for the previous week.

Police have said the pair were discovered together but have not said where in the house they were found.

They
have confirmed that the 'indication' from the post-mortem was that Mrs 
Holgate died before her mother, but it has not been established how long
before.

Search: Officers enter the house near a black garage following the discovery on Saturday

Crime scene: Police have said they were 'keeping an open mind' about the motive behind the killings and said the house did not appear to have been burgled

It is also understood that Mrs Holgate was not in a romantic relationship with Mr Morrow at the time she died.

Police
have said they were 'keeping an open mind' about the motive behind the 
killings and said the house did not appear to have been burgled.

Officers were called to the scene at around 5.45pm.

Stunned neighbours described Ms Holgate as a 'lovely, quiet woman'.

She had lived in the house for around 20 years.
