Brighton failed to persuade Sami Hyypia to make a U-turn on his decision to quit as manager on Monday.

Uwe Rosler, who was sacked by Wigan Athletic last month, heads the Championship club’s shortlist for Hyypia’s replacement with Tim Sherwood and Tony Pulis also on their wishlist.

Former Liverpool defender Hyypia tendered his resignation on Monday morning with the club, known to have one of the smallest budgets in the Championship, in the bottom three. 

Sami Hyypia has resigned as manager of Brighton & Hove Albion

Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed they have accepted the resignation of first-team manager Sami Hyypia.

Chairman Tony Bloom said, 'Sami offered his resignation, and we reluctantly accepted earlier today (Monday).

'Sami has worked extremely hard since joining the club last summer. Despite some good performances, including most recently at Wolves, results haven't gone as well as we all had hoped and expected.

'Sami is an incredibly honourable man. He remains a hugely respected and very popular figure at our club. He has decided to step down for the benefit of the team and the club.

'We are all very disappointed, but we respect Sami’s decision and we all wish him well for the future.'

Nathan Jones, assistant manager, will take charge of the team for the Boxing Day fixture against Reading.

The club will offer no further comment at this stage.

Head of football operations David Burke could be next to leave the club.
