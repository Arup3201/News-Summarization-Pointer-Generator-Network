The Fast and the Furious may be a Hollywood fantasy, but a new documentary reveals that the world of underground racing is alive and well in Britain too.

Young men from all around the country gather at giant race meetings to compare their cars, which tend to be affordable models which have been modified with extra lights and powerful sound systems.

The police are keen to crack down on the racing scene, saying it endangers both the drivers themselves and their fellow road users.

Boy racers: A new documentary reveals the world of secret race meetings where hundreds of people gather to admire super-fast cars

Meeting: Police are trying to crack down on the gatherings saying they promote dangerous behaviour

Danger: The cars often go well over the speed limit as they race each other on public roads

However, many of those who attend the
 meetings come from depressed areas, and claim that the work they do on 
their cars is the only thing that keeps them out of more serious 
trouble.

The hidden story of these passionate motorists is revealed in Boy Racer: Fast & Furious In The UK, a documentary made by Rhys James and Grant Armour for Vice.

The
 short film follows both sides of the boy racer divide - a pair of 
policemen supervising a gathering in Essex, and a car fanatic from 
Tyneside who loves customising his car and racing other drivers.

At
 the late-night meeting in Essex, young men show off their cheap cars, 
which they paint in gaudy colours and deck out with flashy accessories.

One
 racer proudly displays his lit-up door handles and a strip of lights 
along the underside of his car - which he boasts cost just Â£11.50 in 
total.

Star: Much of the film focusses on Ollie, from Whitley Bay in North Tyneside

Thrill: He says the high-speed manoeuvres he pulls off are exciting enough to outweigh the dangers

Out in the open: The racers manage to avoid police attention despite racing in public

Another tells the filmmakers that he has covered his Vauxhall Corsa in 2,500 stickers, and installed a sound system which is powerful enough to make people's hair stand on end.

Much of the documentary focusses on Ollie, from Whitley Bay, who is proud to call himself a boy racer and frequently travels the length of the country to attend meetings

He admits that his hobby is extremely dangerous - but says that his hometown is so deprived that he has no other way of occupying himself.

'There's nothing much to do for young uns around here,' he says. 'I'd probably do what a lot of people are now- just go on the dole and go and get p***ed every day.'

He has a Subaru Impreza, painted 'burnt tangerine candy orange', and spends his evenings trying to avoid the police as he takes to dual carriageways and pits his powers against his brother, another keen racer.

Tricked out: Many of the cars involved are cheap motors with additions such as powerful sound systems

Skid: The film chronicles exciting but potentially deadly moments in races between competing drivers

The drivers are aware of the risks they face by racing on public roads, but they tend to blame motorists who are not as good at driving as they think they are.

One of Ollie's friends, who works in a scrapyard, tells the film: 'People that think they can drive but obviously they can't, and then they end up in here.'

The police in the documentary highlights the dangers by telling of the horrors they face when dealing with the aftermath of fatal accidents.

'You see the consequences and you see how much it rips apart families for what we'll call a moment of madness,' one says.

'It's horrendous having to go to someone's house and tell them that their son or daughter has been killed.'
