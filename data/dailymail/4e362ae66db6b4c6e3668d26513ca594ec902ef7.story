A glamorous black firearms officer in line for substantial compensation over racist discrimination has been arrested for alleged assault.

PC Carol Howard, 35, is at the centre of two separate police investigations,  it can be revealed.

The elite Diplomatic Protection Group officer, who was Scotland Yard’s Olympic Games security poster girl, has been arrested three times, including twice for allegedly assaulting a man.

One of the arrests, believed to be linked to her personal life, is understood to have taken place at a South London police station where her former husband, also an officer, is based.

The single mother-of-two has not carried a gun since August last year and was suspended from duty in April after the latest alleged attack.

The Daily Mail can reveal Miss Howard is under investigation for assault, harassment, making threats to damage property, perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and possession an indecent image of a child.

If found guilty, she has been warned her actions could end her police career. However her lawyer last night said the arrest smacked of victimisation.

Miss Howard, who is a martial arts fan and fitness fanatic, won an employment tribunal against the Met earlier this week after being bullied for a year by a senior officer.

The judges ruled she was the victim of sexual and racial discrimination while working in the DPG unit, which is dominated by white men.

But it can now be revealed that Miss Howard is herself under criminal investigation. Sussex Police continue to investigate her after she was arrested on August 29, 2013, on suspicion of assault, harassment and making threats to damage property.

She was arrested again on a later date on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and possession of an indecent image of a child under 16. Last night, Sussex Police said no further action was being taken over the allegation of assault but inquiries continued on the other matters. The Met is also investigating after she was arrested on suspicion of assault a second time on April 22 in Sutton, South London.

As a result of this arrest, Miss Howard, who lives in Coulsdon, South London, and has served with the Met for more than ten years, was suspended from duty.

Miss Howard will answer bail next month, but colleagues fear that whatever the outcome of the criminal inquiries the arrests could signal the end of her police career. One said: ‘Even if everything goes her way and is dropped, the simple fact of the arrests could be seen as bringing the service into disrepute.’

Miss Howard became a high-profile figure after she was hand-picked by chiefs to appear in a glossy magazine photo shoot to stress the diversity of policing in the capital. A Met spokesman confirmed that Miss Howard was suspended from duty on April 30 ‘following her arrest as part of ongoing criminal investigations’.

Miss Howard’s lawyer Kiran Daurka, of Slater & Gordon, said: ‘Against the background of the employment tribunal’s findings about the conduct of the Met towards PC Howard, this latest development can be seen as victimisation against our client by the Met.

‘We are considering the position and will be advising our client as to any further legal action. She continues to have the support of the Police Federation and the Metropolitan Police Federation.’

Last night Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe defended his force’s record on race. But asked about Miss Howard’s arrests, he added: ‘I’m not prepared at all to discuss this separate, irrelevant issue.’
