The mother of a teenage girl who died in a road accident in South Africa the day before she was due to get her GCSE results has paid tribute to her 'happy and beautiful' daughter.

Skye Wilsnagh, 17, from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, was visiting her grandmother with her twin sister Courtney at the time of the accident last month.

The teenager's family has held memorial services in both South Africa and the UK after she died on August 21, the day before she was due to receive her GCSE results.

'Happy and beautiful': Tributes have been paid to Skye Wilsnagh who died in a road accident in South Africa the day before her GCSE results

Her mother Miranda told MailOnline: 'Skye was a twin so her sister is obviously as heart-broken as I am, if not more so.

'None of us can actually understand the bond between twins, so with her having lost her sister it has been absolutely horrific and it was just such a pointless accident.

'She was just so healthy, happy and beautiful.'

Mrs Wilsnagh and her husband William discovered their daughter had passed all of her GCSEs and was on course to study at Henley College college with her sister Courtney. She had planned to go on to university to become a criminal psychologist.

She said: 'Obviously Courtney has now started at college, but it's hard.

'The fact that life's got to carry on without her, it's just so devastating. We will miss her very much.'

Tribute: Skye (left, with her twin sister Courtney) was always 'dancing, smiling and singing', her mother has said

Mrs Wilsnagh said her daughter had been on holiday in Spain with her friend the week before she visited her grandmother in South Africa.

She said: 'We are very honoured to say we have had a child like Skye in our lives and she will be very sorely missed.

'If you saw Skye walking into a room she would actually be dancing into it, she was always dancing and smiling and joking around.'

'That's what we are going to miss the most about her, just what a happy, cheerful person she was.'

Mrs Wilsnagh said she had been 'amazed' by the 'love and support' her family had received from friends and neighbours in the UK.

She said: 'We have just been absolutely amazed by people's love and generosity.

'On our return from South Africa we came home to a house full of flowers, fruit baskets, fresh bread, milk and food in the fridge; and the neighbours have even taken turns to provide us with home cooked meals every night so I don't have to deal with the grief, as well as give a thought to what's on the dinner table at night.

'We are just absolutely amazed by the love and support we have received by everyone.'

Last
Monday a memorial service was held at St Teresa's Catholic Church in 
Beaconsfield, which featured a eulogy read by Skye's older brother Kyle,
21.

John Fletcher headteacher at The Beaconsfield School, said: 'Skye was an amazing young lady who had immense potential. Since joining the school Skye has been an inspiration to all students she came into contact with.

'Her leadership skills and ability to motivate people was self-evident in her role as a prefect, she gave of her time freely in order to ensure that she could help others to reach their full potential.

'Her determination to succeed was clear for all to see, she had achieved good GCSE results to enable her to study her chosen A levels. Skye will be sadly missed by all who knew her.'

The school is planning to remember Skye in a permanent way by creating an award in her name which will be presented annually at the school's awards evening in the summer. 

Mrs Wilsnagh said: 'Her friends from both countries were devastated after hearing the news that Skye was no longer with us.

'Skye was well-loved and really made a difference to everyone she met.'

Mrs Wilsnagh said Skye’s choice to study criminal psychology was fitting for the person she was.

She said: 'When we asked her why she wanted to study criminal psychology, she said she wanted to give people a second chance. It was just who she was.'

Skye and her sister regularly volunteered at Lory Park Zoo, in South Africa, and at Dipley Mill Gardens, in Hook, every summer.

She was also a volunteer at St Teresa's Church where she helped to raise money for Sparkles, a charity supporting children with Down's Syndrome.
