One former U.S service member alleges she was raped by a fellow cadet and then forced to take out her attacker’s trash as punishment for reporting the assault to the military school.

Another service member claims she was raped twice by two fellow students at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and then made to drop out after she told an army counselor about the attacks.

These women are the latest in a string of former and current U.S service members who are suing military officials for systematically ignoring a 'staggering' number of sexual assaults.

Naval Academy in Annapolis: Two women who said they were raped while attending U.S. military academies sued military officials on Friday, accusing them of failing to address widespread problems of sexual assault at the elite schools

Lawsuit: Leah Marquet, a former cadet at the Military Academy in West Point, said she was pressured by upperclassmen to get drunk and raped by a fellow student while she was intoxicated

In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, Leah Marquet, 20, and Anne Kendzior, 22, said the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and the Army's United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, tolerate sexual assault and discourage victims of attacks from reporting them.

'Both institutions systematically and repeatedly ignore rampant sexual harassment,' the lawsuit filed by the two women stated.

'Both institutions have a history of failing to prosecute and punish those students found to have sexually assaulted and raped their fellow students.'

In the lawsuit, Marquet, a former West Point cadet, said she was pressured by upperclassmen to get drunk and raped by a fellow student while she was intoxicated.

After she reported the assault, other students taunted her, the lawsuit said, and the school punished her for reporting the incident by forcing her to take out her alleged rapist’s trash.

She quit West Point after becoming suicidal, the documents claimed.

Kendzior,
who entered the Naval Academy in 2008, said she was raped twice by two 
different fellow students, both times while she was drunk.

Kendzior accused the Naval Academy of forcing her to leave after she reported the rapes to an academy counselor.

The
suit accused former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and four other 
military officials of failing to implement steps to fight sexual 
assaults at the schools.

The suit seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages.

U.S. Navy Commander William Marks, a Naval Academy spokesman, declined comment on the lawsuit itself, but said the academy takes every report of alleged sexual assault 'extremely seriously' and that its 'sexual assault response and advocacy program is among the strongest in the nation.'

Claims: Former Marine Corps officer Ariana Klay claims she was raped at the U.S. Marine Barracks in Washington D.C., one of the most prestigious bases in the country

Fighter: Ariana Klay served a tour in Iraq before returning to Annapolis, where the rape occurred at the hand of her superior officer

Dress: After speaking publicly, Ms Klay was harassed by other Marines saying she 'asked for it' because she wore makeup and occasionally running shorts

Officials at West Point said they 
could not comment on pending litigation, but that the school takes 
sexual harassment issues 'very seriously.'

'Every
unrestricted report of sexual assault is thoroughly investigated, the 
results of the investigation are reviewed by legal experts and 
appropriate action taken,' said Lt. Col. Sherri K. Reed, the academy's 
spokesperson.

Officials at the Pentagon had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

Last month, eight other women filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington saying they were raped, assaulted or sexually harassed while in the military, and were retaliated against when they complained.

Victim: Lt Elle Helmer (seen in both photos above) said she was raped at Annapolis in 2006

Lt Ariana Klay and Lt Elle Helmer both claim they were raped at the U.S. Marine Barracks in Washington D.C., one of the most prestigious bases in the country.

They said that in addition to being raped with little or no justice following the alleged incidents, their fellow Marines ridiculed them for being ‘sluts’ and ‘walking mattresses.’

The latest lawsuit was filed less than a week after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced new steps to curb thousands of sexual assaults a year within the military.
