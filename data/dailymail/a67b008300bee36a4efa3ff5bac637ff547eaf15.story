Deadliest Catch captain, Sig Hansen, is not the most obvious fashion icon. But the TV star's rugged sense of style is reportedly going mainstream - and producing a surge in sales of so-called trawlerman chic on the high street.

Demand for fishing favourites such as duffle coats, cream cable 
knit jumpers, chunky woollen socks, stripy T-shirts and rugged boots 
has soared over the last month, according to Debenhams, with further increases expected as the 
cold weather continues.

Along with Captain Sig, stars driving the trend include David Beckham and Robbie Williams - both of whom have been spotted sporting cosy cable knit cardigans recently.

One Direction's Liam Payne is also a fan, recently having been snapped heading into the ITV Daybreak studio clad in his trusty grey cable knit.

Sales figures released by Debenhams show that British men are particularly partial to a pair of chunky boots, which are up 81 per cent, duffle coats, striped t-shirts, thermal underwear and heavy knits.

According to the retailer, Deadliest Catch and other fishing-focused TV shows such as Extreme Fishing with Robson Green, are the driving force behind the trend.'No longer just the hobby of a solitary riverbank dweller, these TV shows have made ‘fisherman fashion’ mainstream,' says Lizzie Singleton, spokesman for Debenhams.

With designers such as 
Acne's Jonny Johansson, Burberry's Christopher Bailey and Paul Smith all showing angling-inspired pieces too, the trend looks set to stay.

'The humble duffle coat, waterproof trousers and obligatory chunky socks [are] the must have look for autumn/winter 2012,' says Singleton, who adds that the coolest way to wear
fisherman 
fashion is to work in bold colours toned down with neutral 
boots and a classic navy beanie.

'Even television Trawlermen, documenting the tough times of the Peterhead and Fraserburgh fishing fleets and arguably the most unlikely fashion icons, has shown the average British landlubber the masculine appeal of a hardy seaman,' notes Singleton.Debenhams has also seen the look creeping into womenswear with bright duffle coats, cable knit jumpers and chunky cardigans worn by the likes of Alexa Chung leading the way.'The tough, capable image of seafaring clothing seems to have chimed with the mood of the nation during the financial difficulties,' comments Singleton.'Knowing that you are well equipped to cope with everything life can throw at you – no matter how hard the going becomes – is now seen as essential to weather the economic storm.'Warm, hardwearing and now stylish, these items herald the return of practical fashion that will see you through the season and beyond.'
