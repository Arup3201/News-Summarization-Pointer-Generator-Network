Manchester City cruised to a 3-0 over Crystal Palace as Manuel Pellegrini's side maintained the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea.

David Silva's double and Yaya Toure's powerful strike ensured the home side secured all three points from their clash with the Eagles.  

Sportsmail's Adam Crafton rated the players' performances at Etihad Stadium. 

Manchester City (4-2-3-1) 

Joe Hart  6 

Little to do and it's now five clean sheets in six games for the England goalkeeper.

Pablo Zabaleta 6.5

Had some tricky moments dealing with Bolasie but overlapping runs and that infectious attitude made a difference in attack for City.

Martin Demichelis 6

Holding the defence together in the absence of captain Vincent Kompany. Classy on the ball and calm in the tackle.

Eliaquim Mangala 6

The Frenchman is improving after a difficult start and is beginning to resemble a £32m defender.

Aleksandar Kolarov 6.5

Not the best defender but a superior attacking outlet to Clichy going forward. Whipped cross created Silva's second goal.

Yaya Toure 7

Blazed over on two occasions when presented with good opportunities but a controlling presence as City coasted through the second period. Glorious third after a classic burst from the midfield.

Fernandinho 6

Usual dynamic presence in midfield and looks back to his best.

Jesus Navas 5

Frustrating to watch. Lightning quick, finds himself in good positions but often lacks an end product.

David Silva 8

Stood up to be counted in the absence of City's usual marksmen. A wonderful footballer and after hitting his third and fourth goals of the season, he should be aiming for 10 from this campaign.

Samir Nasri 7.5

In the best form of his Manchester City career and his understanding with Silva seems telepathic at times. Some lovely turns and intricate passing around the penalty area.

James Milner 7

Ran himself into the ground, as you'd expect, and did a good job in the circumstances. He will, however, be looking forward to returning to midfield duty soon.

SUBS

Lampard (Silva, 68) 6

Calm in possession as City saw out an easy win.

Fernando (Milner, 80) 5.5

Played the final ten minutes with the result secured. Will have a big role to play over the Christmas period.

Sinclair (Nasri, 88) 5.5

Rare outing late on.

Crystal Palace (4-3-3)  

Julian Speroni 5.5

Helpless for the three City goals but otherwise barely tested.

Martin Kelly 5

Struggled to handle Kolarov's overlaps but might have wished for greater help from those in front of him.

Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni had a busy day guarding the visitors' goal 

Brede Hangeland 5.5

Had the beating of Milner in the air but encountered greater problems when Toure, Silva and Nasri moved ball sharply around the penalty area.

Scott Dann 6

Unfortunate deflection led to Silva's first goal but otherwise a combative performance at centre-half.

Joel Ward 5

Won't be the first - or last - but Ward found it tough going against the relentless Zabaleta. More comfortable dealing with Navas.

Mile Jedinak 6

Reads the game well and anchored the midfield with authority, providing a platform for Palace to counter.

James McArthur 5.5

Positionally good, ran hard but seemed to lose belief after City went 2-0 up.

Joe Ledley 5

Overwhelmed by the power and pace of Fernandinho and Toure. A difficult day for the midfielder.

McArthur shoots at goal but is thwarted by Joe Hart and was also unlucky to have a goal ruled out 

Jason Puncheon 5.5

Didn't do enough to influence the game in an attacking sense and could have done more to stop Kolarov's forays forward.

Fraizer Campbell 5

Might have done better with a half-chance in the first half but ran the ball out of play as Hart approached but came close with a wonderful acrobatic attempt moments before.

Yannick Bolasie 6

More wonderful tricks and by some distance Palace's most threatening player.

Palace forward Yannick Bolasie was his side's most dangerous player in Manchester 

SUBS

Wilfried Zaha (Campbell, 68) 6

Some nice flashes but little of substance.

Jerome Thomas (Puncheon, 83) 5.5

Arrived too late to influence proceedings.

Barry Banaan (Ledley, 88) 5

Game all but over when he entered.
