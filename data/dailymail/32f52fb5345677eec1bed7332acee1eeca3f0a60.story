Lord Patten was fighting for his job last night as it emerged he had known of Newsnight’s disastrous plan to link a senior Tory to child abuse before the show aired.

Downing Street warned the BBC chairman to ‘get a grip’ of the crisis that saw the dramatic resignation of director general George Entwistle on Saturday night.

But Lord Patten was forced to face down calls for his own resignation after he admitted he had known of Newsnight’s intention but failed to warn senior colleagues.

He had also failed to tip off Mr Entwistle, simply ‘assuming’ he had been told of the wholly false claims regarding former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has been left dismayed by the slow response of both Lord Patten and Mr Entwistle to the latest crisis.

Ministers are reluctant to intervene directly and will give Lord Patten a chance to show he can steady the ship – provided he acts quickly.

But they are concerned that the dithering, first highlighted in the BBC’s stumbling response to the Jimmy Savile scandal, is having a catastrophic impact on public trust in the Corporation.In other developments yesterday:

Yesterday Lord Patten insisted that he would not bow to pressure to quit – but admitted his job was on the line unless he could turn the situation around quickly.

‘If I don’t do that and if we don’t restore the huge confidence and trust that people have in the BBC then I’m sure people will tell me to take my cards and clear off,’ he said.

A senior Government source was scathing about the chairman’s performance.

‘Lord Patten has got to demonstrate he can get a grip,’ the source said. ‘Can he show he is taking control of the situation?’

Another source said: ‘For weeks we’ve had Patten in, saying you have got to make sure you have got a grip – and now we get this.’

Crisis: The BBC needs a radical overhaul following the resignation of its chief executive in wake of a scandal over a botched report on child sex-abuse allegations, Mr Patten said

In a round of media interviews 
yesterday Lord Patten pledged a ‘thorough, radical, structural overhaul’
of the Corporation’s management and said a new director general would 
be appointed ‘within weeks’.

Underlining the seriousness of the crisis he said the BBC was ‘over’ unless it failed to restore trust in its journalism.

‘The basis for the licence fee, the basis for the BBC’s position in this country is the trust that people have in it. If the BBC loses that, it is over.’

But Lord Patten faced demands for his own resignation after admitting that he knew in advance about the sensational claims being made by Newsnight but failed to check they had been properly investigated.

He said he had seen the Twitter message from Iain Overton, head of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, hours before Newsnight was screened on November 2.

Former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine will sue the BBC over the Newsnight broadcast, as reported in Saturday's Mail

The message, on the social networking site Twitter, said: ‘We’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile.’

It sparked a storm of media interest in the programme and led to the wrongful identification on the Internet of former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine.

Lord Patten said he had not done anything about it until the following day, Saturday November 3, when he ‘tried to establish whether or not there was adequate managerial control over Newsnight’.

Mr Overton’s message did not identify the politician as a Conservative, but Lord Patten suggested that as a former Tory chairman it would have been ‘entirely improper’ for him to make what would have been seen as a political intervention.

He said he had not told Mr Entwistle because he ‘assumed he had been told by his senior colleagues’.

In an interview with the BBC’s Today programme on Saturday morning that helped seal his fate, Mr Entwistle was ridiculed for admitting he knew nothing about the Newsnight programme until the following day.
