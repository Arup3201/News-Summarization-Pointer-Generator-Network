Next year will be the tenth anniversary of the Boxing Day tsunami that claimed 230,000 lives. It will be a poignant date for brothers Rob and Paul Forkan from Southfields, London, - as it was the last time they saw their parents, Kevin and Sandra.

But it is also the date when they hope to open a children's home in Goa, the product of years of hard work to build something positive out of their family tragedy. Â 

The family were caught up in the natural disaster while they were staying in Sri Lanka in 2004. Rob and Paul, then aged 17 and 15 respectively, survived by clinging on to the roof of a building when the giant wave hit the coastline.

Fashion with a purpose: Brothers Rob and Paul sell flip flops to help under privileged children around the world

Target: They hope to have enough money to open their first children's home in Goa at the end of next year

Their
parents had managed to get their younger brother, Mattie, then aged 12,
and sister, Rosie, eight, to safety before being swept away.

The orphans were left with nothing and had to hitchhike across the devastated country to make it back to Britain where they would be cared for by their extended family and friends.

But rather than being broken by the tragedy, the brothers decided to do something positive to honour the memory of their mother and father and help other orphaned children around the world.

Taking inspiration from their philanthropist parents, who had given up their jobs in the fashion industry to volunteer for humanitarian projects, the pair designed flip flops made from natural materials with a woven rope style.

Under the brand name Gandys, sales of the flips flops funds their 'Orphans for Orphans' initiative. Their goal is to raise enough money to open their first children's home by the end of next year in Goa.

So far their enterprise has also funded a teacher and a nurse in India for a year and bought school supplies for over 100 children in Asia.

Rob, now 25, told the MailOnline: 'We travelled the world with our parents as they carried out volunteer work. They wanted to quit the rat race to experience other cultures and make a difference.

'They sold our family home in Croydon and took my brothers and sister and I out of school and we moved initially to India.

'We'd been travelling for three years when we became orphans ourselves and we wanted to do something positive.

'We wanted to build a brand based on our beliefs and family values with the target of opening our first children's home in Goa on the tenth anniversary of the tsunami.'

Starting out from their bedroom in Brixton, the flip flop design evolved to be made from rubber while still incorporating the distinctive pleated toe bar. They have men and women's styles with vibrant colours and patterns.

Thanks to the brothers hard work and marketing skills, the flip flops are now being stocked by Selfridges, Schuh and Topman (where they sold out after first going on sale) among other well-known shoe stores.

They have also garnered a celebrity following with Sir Richard Branson (who now stocks them on his island), Jamie Oliver and Michelle Keegan being pictured wearing them.

Numerous other stars have Tweeted their support for the brand from Jessie J to Stephen Fry.

Rob said: 'We're amazed about how far we've 
gotten in such a short time; we really couldn't believe it when we got 
told that we'd sold out in Topman.'

Paul, 23, added: 'We've
still got a lot of work to do before we can open our first children's 
home next year but we know that our parents would be proud of how much 
we've achieved already.'
