Happier and healthier: children with same-sex parents experience higher levels of family cohesion than those in traditional families, study shows.

Children of same-sex couples experience higher levels of general health and family cohesion than those from traditional families, a study shows.

But the researchers warned that the stigma associated with their parents' sexual orientation is an ongoing challenge for these children.

Researchers from the University of Melbourne surveyed 315 same-sex parents with a total of 500 children. About 80 per cent of the children have female parents, while 18 per cent have male parents.

The children raised by same-sex partners scored an average of six per cent higher than the general population on measures of general health and family cohesion.

They were equivalent to those from the general population on measures of temperament and mood, behaviour, mental health and self-esteem.

Lead researcher Dr Simon Crouch said same-sex couples are more likely to share child-care and work responsibilities more equitably than heterosexual parent families, based more on skills rather than gender roles.

'This appears to be contributing to a more harmonious household and having a positive impact on child health,' he said.

But about two-thirds of these children experience some form of stigma due to their parents' sexual orientation, he said.

'What we have found is that the more stigma these families experience the greater the impact on the social and emotional wellbeing of children.'

The most recent census counted 6300 children living in same-sex couple families.
