All around, the city was in flames. Broken glass was strewn in the streets.

This was Kristallnacht 1938, when Nazi stormtroopers unleashed their hatred on Jewish businesses, synagogues, shops and homes — and the fire brigade stood idly by.

Up to 30,000 people across Germany were arrested, beaten, murdered or sent to concentration camps.

Sir Ludwig Guttmann, the founding father of the modern day Paralympics, escaped Nazi Germany and transformed perceptions of disabilities in sport

But, in the town of Breslau, there was a hero of the hour: doctor Ludwig Guttmann.

As traumatised Jews turned up at his hospital, he instructed staff to admit them, even if their injuries were too minor for an overnight stay.

When the Gestapo arrived to round them up, he persuaded the officers that they were all too sick to leave. He saved 60 people from certain death in concentration camps.

Six athletes will ‘fly’ into tonight’s spectacular Paralympics opening ceremony in golden wheelchairs, it was revealed last night.

The dramatic scenes will be at the heart of the showpiece opening, which is expected to be watched on TV by a record billion people around the world, as well as 80,000 in the stadium.

Among those flying into the stadium in wheelchairs will be Britain’s greatest ever paralympian, 11-time champion Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, 43.

The ceremony, which is entitled Enlightenment, begins at 8.30pm and will kick-start 11 days of sport in front of unprecedented crowds – the event is on course to be the first sell-out Paralympic Games in history.

Great Britain is hoping for a record haul of medals surpassing the 102 won in Beijing in 2008 as athletes are inspired by their home crowds, as happened during the Olympics.

Last night transport chiefs warned the Paralympics would pose a ‘huge challenge’ for London’s transport network, saying they feared the many Londoners who worked from home during the Olympics would not be doing the same during the games.

But London Mayor Boris Johnson promised that the Paralympics would be a ‘wonderful show’ and would change the preconception of disabilities for good.

As thousands rushed to buy the remaining tickets, the mayor said the opening ceremony would be ‘superb’ and that the public would be ‘blown away’ by the level of sportsmanship on display.

Tonight’s event will open with the words ‘O wonder! How many goodly creatures there are here’ from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, with a young actress playing the character of Miranda leading the audience through the ceremony.

Ludwig Guttmann is also the 
inspirational neurosurgeon who founded the Paralympic Games and changed 
the course of thousands of lives.

Before 1948, when Britain last hosted the Olympics, patients with severed spinal cords were rarely rehabilitated, let alone to the extent that could compete in sports.

With no active life to look forward to and poor care, they contracted infections, gave up hope, and were usually dead within weeks or months.

But World War II meant hospitals were flooded with servicemen who had suffered this type of injury.

Enter
Dr Guttmann, a Jewish German refugee who had fled to England in 1939 
and was working at the specialist Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 
Aylesbury, Bucks.

Guttmann 
was a passionate believer in the power of sport to inspire and motivate —
and he  introduced an athletic competition in the grounds of the 
hospital to coincide with the Olympics at London’s Wembley.

His
first event was wheelchair archery. Though only 16 competitors took 
part, including two women, the notion of paraplegics becoming athletes 
was ground-breaking.

His
games gave birth to the Paralympics, and he was nicknamed Poppa by one 
and all — commemorating his role as the father of the Games

Sixty-four
years later, his dream has been well and truly realised. Tomorrow, 
4,200 athletes from 165 nations will begin competing with the world 
watching them.

But Guttmann’s early life gave no hint
to the visionary he would become. He was born in the coal-mining 
district of Upper Silesia (now Poland) in 1899 to an orthodox Jewish 
family, and took a volunteer job at a local hospital for mining injuries
when he was 18.

He was 
particularly touched by the plight of one young miner he tended. This 
man had a fine physique but had broken his back in a mining accident.

He
was paralysed from the waist down and the doctors held out no hope. The
accepted method of treatment in those days was to encase patients in 
plaster and isolate them.

They
would die within weeks. This is what happened to that young man, who 
got a urinary infection and blood poisoning, and died within five weeks.

Guttmann said later: ‘Although I saw 
many more victims suffering the same fate, it was the picture of that 
young man which remained indelibly fixed in my memory.’

The archery competition at Stoke Mandeville was the precursor to the modern Paralympics, giving war veterans with terrible injuries strength and confidence

The
following year, Guttmann started medical studies at the University of 
Breslau. He continued at Freiburg, and developed an interest in physical
training and sport.

He
was already a member of a Jewish fraternity determined to use sport to 
impart confidence and self-esteem to members feeling the scourge of 
anti-Semitism.

After failing
to find a job in paediatrics, he returned to Breslau and enrolled in 
the neurology and neurosurgery department. By the time Adolf Hitler had 
risen to power in 1933, Guttmann was director of Breslau’s Jewish 
hospital.

His growing reputation led to many offers to work abroad. He turned them all down — until Kristallnacht.

In 1984 Prince Charles opened the Paralympics, complete with sombrero

By then, Guttmann was married with two children, Dennis and Eva, and he knew he’d have to leave Germany for their safety.

He
got £250 (£10,000 today) from the Council for Assisting Refugee 
Academics — a charity led by the Master of Oxford’s Balliol College — 
and started work in the city’s Radcliffe Infirmary.

Dr Guttmann was a popular figure, but there were many who thought his ideas fanciful. He tirelessly argued, though, that with proper treatment paraplegics could live full and rewarding lives

Guttmann made such an impression that the government asked him in September 1943 to open a centre for spinal injuries, anticipating a rise in patients after the planned D-Day landings against Germany.

He agreed on the condition he could implement his own treatment theories, and picked Stoke Mandeville for his base, taking up his post on February 1, 1944.

His unit was called Ward X and had 26 beds and one patient.

Guttmann was a popular figure — but there were many who thought his ideas fanciful. He tirelessly argued, though, that with proper treatment paraplegics could live full and rewarding lives.

Sport was a critical part of the therapeutic programme he designed for his patients. Guttmann’s daughter Eva Loeffler, who at 79 is a torchbearer and this year’s Mayor of the Paralympic village, recently said: ‘My father’s big thing was that he was determined to make his patients taxpayers.

‘One of them told me he was lying in a
corner of the ward feeling sorry for himself and my father came along 
and asked, “What are you doing?” He said he was waiting to die. So my 
father said that, whilst you’re waiting for the Good Lord to take you, 
go to the workshop and do some carpentry, do some work, start a career.

‘So
he did. And this chap told me that after leaving hospital, he actually 
became the head of a building firm and did very well.’

Guttmann
ended up inspiring thousands — and changing the way the nation thinks 
about paraplegics. Last month, a statue to him was unveiled at Stoke 
Mandeville.

But his real 
legacy will be the performances during the next two weeks. As his son 
Dennis told the participants of the 1980 Stoke Mandeville Games: ‘You 
are my father’s memorial.’
