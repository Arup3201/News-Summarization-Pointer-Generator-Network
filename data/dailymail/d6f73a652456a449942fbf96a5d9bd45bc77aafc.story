A kangaroo who may have been a little too keen for a drink and got its head stuck in a watering can has been saved by two quick-thinking men.

The kangaroo was spotted in a paddock near a golf course at Coffin Bay in South Australia on Saturday morning, the Advertiser reports.

Ian Berry, who had just finished a round of golf, went to check on the kangaroo as two men who had spotted it earlier returned to the paddock with a rope and tin cutters. 

The kangaroo was spotted with its head stuck in a watering can in a paddock near a golf course at Coffin Bay in South Australia on Saturday morning

'They used rope first... one had rope tied around the can and the other had the roo's tail and they tried pulling but it didn't work,' Mr Berry told the newspaper.

'At this point it  was pretty tired because it had been trying to kick the can off... (the men) were able to get close enough to cut the can off.'

Mr Berry managed to snap several remarkable photos of the two men, Rob Smith and Steve Dew, pulling the animal's tail and attaching ropes to the watering can to free the roo.

The roo is believed to have found some water in the can and accidentally got his head stuck as he had a drink

Rob Smith and Steve Dew came to the paddock armed with some tin cutters and a long rope to help free the distressed kangaroo

After several attempts, the distressed kangaroo was freed and hopped away quickly.

'It wouldn't have survived too long if Rob and Steve hadn't gotten the can off,' Mr Berry said.

He suspects the kangaroo found some water in the can and put its head in for a drink.

'He is one lucky kangaroo... he hopped off, no doubt with a sore neck, but happy to be alive.' 

Coffin Bay residents thanked the two men on the city's Facebook page.

'A big thank you to Rob Smith and Steve Dew who saved this large male kangaroo from certain death after being able to get close enough to cut the watering can so as to be able to pull the kangaroo's head out of the can,' they wrote.
