A 32-year-old Seattle man faces more than two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges that he stole a 480-ton passenger ferry and set sail in Elliot Bay last month.

When first confronted by police - while still aboard the vessel - the apparently drunk man would only identify himself a pirate named 'Zero.'

Further, 'Pirate Zero' asked that authorities bring him a woman.

'Pirate Zero' was later identified as Samuel Kenneth McDonough, whom, by all accounts, is in no way, shape or form a pirate.

The incident happened on December 1 - McDonough's 32nd birthday - when he boarded the cruise ferry on the Seattle waterfront and set sail into the bay.

Shortly after hijacking the boat, authorities found him adrift in the bay.

'When contacted by police SWAT-team officers while adrift in Elliott Bay,
 Mr. McDonough proclaimed himself a pirate, and said he intended to flee
 the country to Victoria, B.C.,' according to court records obtained by Q13FOX.com.

'The subject identified himself as ''Zero'' and requested safe passage 
somewhere where he would not get in trouble for stealing the boat. 
Throughout the conversation, "Zero" made several rambling statements 
regarding maritime law, piracy and international waters. "Zero" at one 
time requested a woman be brought to his location because he was 
lonely,' the court records show. 

Upon his arrest, police found a bottle of wine lying on the floor of the main cabin and bottle of liquor on a seat.

McDonouch later told police that his plan was to ditch the boat in West Seattle or the Duwamish River.

He now faces 22-29 months in jail after pleading guilty to theft of a motor vehicle and second-degree burglary.

'Apparently on a whim, as a birthday present to himself, Mr. McDonough 
took control of an $8 million, 480-ton, 132-foot passenger cruise vessel
 and ripped it from the dock at the Seattle waterfront in the predawn 
darkness,' prosecutors said in court documents. '...Mr. McDonoughâ€™s only prior experience operating 
any kind of boat was with a Sea-Doo personal watercraft.'

Prosecutors are asking that McDonough be sentenced to the maximum 29 months.

His sentencing is scheduled for January 24.
