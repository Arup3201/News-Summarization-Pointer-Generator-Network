Barcelona have sacked sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, while club legend Carles Puyol has also left his position at the Spanish giants.

Puyol was operating as Zubizarreta's assistant, but announced he had terminated his working contract at the club in the wake of Zubizarreta's sacking on Monday. 

The club will now discuss the future of coach Luis Enrique at an emergency board meeting on Wednesday.

Carles Puyol joined Barcelona's academy at La Masia in 1995

He played for Barcelona C, before moving up to Barcelona B in 1997

In 1998, manager Louis van Gaal agreed a deal with Malaga to sell the defender, but Puyol refused to move after seeing his best friend Xavi make his first-team debut 

In October 1999, Puyol's persistence paid off as he made his first-team bow under Van Gaal

Puyol was named club captain in the summer of 2004 after Luis Enrique - now head coach - retired 

On November 13 2010, Puyol made his 500th appearance in all competitions for Barca 

In March 2014, Puyol surpassed Migueli to go second in Barcelona's all-time league appearance table, only behind Xavi 

Shortly after, he announced his retirement after struggling with injury, and on May 15 2014, bid farewell to his playing career. He was then announced as Andoni Zubizarreta's assistant

The swift action follows the team’s defeat in the first game of the new year against David Moyes's Real Sociedad, although is also a direct consequence of the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision to uphold FIFA’s one-year transfer ban on the club for illegal signing of under-age players.

Luis Enrique’s position is not believed to be under threat but a no-show from Lionel Messi in Monday’s training session added to speculation that the coach has lost the dressing room with players tired of his constant changing of the first XI.

In a statement released on Monday, former Barcelona defender Puyol said: 'I would like to announce to you that I have decided to terminate my working relationship with Barcelona FC.

'These three-and-a-half months have given me the opportunity to see the other side of the club. I have learned a lot, I am very grateful, and now I would like to experience other things from another perspective and in different surroundings.'

His colleague Zubizarreta has paid the price for a failure last summer to effectively strengthen Barcelona’s defence. The club signed Brazilian full-back Douglas and Arsenal’s central defender Thomas Vermaelen but the former has looked hopelessly out of his depth and started only one league game and the latter is yet to play because of injury and needed surgery towards the end of last year which is likely to rule him out for the rest of the season.

Spanish Super Cup: 1984, 1991, 1992 

Post-retirement: 

Athletic Bilbao sporting director (2000-2010)

Barcelona sporting director (2010-14)

There is also a good argument for Barcelona not needing a sporting director now that they know they will not be able to sign any new players until January 2016.

Puyol, in his statement, continued by thanking his former club, at which he played professionally for 15 years until his retirement in the summer. 

'I want to develop not only professionally but on a personal level too so that in the future I could perhaps return to this home and give back everything that you have given to me during these unforgettable years,' he added.

'I continue to be enormously grateful to the employees, directors, president and to the sporting management for trusting and helping me in a transition that is no way easy for me.

'Above all, to the supporters, who I always felt so close to as a player, and now even since my retirement, I feel that it continues much more today. I have been and I am very fortunate to feel so much warmth, for this I can only say THANK YOU and that you know that I will always carry you in my heart.'

Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu will speak on Wednesday about the decision when he is also expected to give coach Luis Enrique a vote of confidence but Messi’s absence with a stomach bug from Monday's training after he was left out of the starting line-up for the opening game of the year has added fuel to rumours the coach who took over at the start of the season has lost the dressing room. 

A Barcelona statement on the sacking of Zubizarreta read: 'The Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has decided to terminate as of today the contract of the club's director of football, Andoni Zubizarreta.

'The president, in the name of the club, thanks Andoni Zubizarreta for his contribution, dedication and professionalism over the last four years in his role at the head of the club's football area.'
