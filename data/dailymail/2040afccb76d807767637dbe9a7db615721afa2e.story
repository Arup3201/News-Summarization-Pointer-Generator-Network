Forget sanding in a clearing and squinting through the clouds for a glimpse of the eclipse, passengers on flights en route to Iceland got the view of a lifetime of the natural phenomenon.

The flight path taken by the pilot of EasyJet's flight 6747 from Belfast on Friday shows an amusing squiggle as it approaches the Faroe Islands, one of just two places on Earth along with Norway's Svalbard archipelago where a total eclipse could be observed.

With a cluster of planes appearing to linger around the archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, EZY6747's pilot gave those on board the Airbus A319 the best possible chance to capture the moment after taking off at 8.05am.

For some eclipse chasers, a final destination wasn't required as a number of private charters set off for the sole purpose of seeing the phenomenon which won't happen again in northern Europe until 2026.

On Jet2.com, 57 passengers booking through Omega Holidays each had their own row of seats from which to view the solar eclipse after flying out of Glasgow Airport at 7.30am.

They flew north of the Faroes at 38,000ft to ensure a cloud-free view of the eclipse with live commentary from astronomer Lee Sproats.

The plane's pilot Captain Christopher Pollock said: 'I can honestly say that was one of the most amazing flights of my life.

'What a special moment to witness and the view was just breathtaking. For the full impact of a total eclipse, you have to be inside the "path of totality", which is quite narrow, but also fast-moving because the planet is rotating. 

So you really have to be in the right place at the right time to get the best view – and thanks to Omega Holidays we were! I’ll definitely be putting my name down for any return flights in 11 years time!'

Jet2.com say passengers came from as far as the United States for the unique round trip.

It was a particularly special day for Daniel Bailey from Leicestershire, who was celebrating his 10th birthday.

'It was just amazing, makes me want to be an astronomer,' he said. 'This was the best birthday present in the world!'

Passengers on flights EZY2295 from London Luton and EZY1805 from Manchester were given the same treat.

'Thanks for circling round the #SolarEclipse. Amazing views from the skies above the Atlantic,' posted the Twitter account for school tour group Rayburn Education with images of the view from flight 1805 from Manchester.

A spokesman for EasyJet said the plane's circling was planned and entirely safe. 

'The flight crews on our EasyJet flights to Reykjavik this morning performed a controlled and safe manoeuvre in order to allow passengers on both sides of the planes to have a grandstand view of one of nature's greatest events, a solar eclipse,' the EasyJet spokesman said. 

All of EasyJets flights into Keflavik International near Reyjavik that coincided with the eclipse were significantly later than their scheduled arrival times, not that the passengers seemed to mind. 

Flight EZY2295 from London Luton was 38 minutes late, EZY1805 from Manchester was 29 minutes late and EZY6747 from Belfast Aldergrove arrived one hour and five minutes later than planned in 'order to allow passengers on both sides of the planes to have a grandstand view of the solar eclipse'.

‘We have had a tide of extremely positive reactions from passengers, commending our crews. For some passengers this may be a once in a generation experience,' said a spokesman for the airline.

‘We’d like to apologise for any delay this might have caused.' 

Before the flights EasyJet claimed the view would be 'one of the closest and unobstructed views of a total eclipse anywhere in the world' and they delivered while people around Britain viewed a partial eclipse if they were lucky to see it through the forecast cloud cover.

'It's great that easyJet passengers will be in the right place at the right time on Friday and are set to be rewarded the best view anywhere in the world from 37,000 feet.

'We would encourage passengers to bring eclipse viewing specs with them and keep their window blinds open for the safest but most spectacular way to view it.' 

Dutch experimental astrophysicist Christoph Keller posted an image he said was taken through 'Polaroid sunglasses and a polarizer on the flight from Sao Paulo to Amsterdam.' 

The French Air Force's precision demonstation team  also saw it as a perfect time to take to the skies posting a series of images with the comment: 'Follow us in flight during the eclipse.'
