A truck driver was killed and several others were injured after a dust storm in rural Nevada blinded drivers, leading to a 27-car pile-up.

Humboldt County sheriff's dispatchers 
called in every emergency services worker in 
the sparsely populated area after drivers reported 'near-apocalyptic' 
conditions on Interstate 80 at Winnemucca on Monday evening.

A mine rescue crew also assisted, while a charter bus helped transport victims.

A dust storm on Interstate 80 in rural northern Nevada led to a 27-car pile-up in zero-visibility conditions. One truck driver was killed and several people were injured

The carnage on I-80 at Winnemucca shut down the east-west corridor, a major trucking route, in both directions while workers cleared the scene of wrecked vehicles and debris

High winds at about 5pm on Monday whipped up dust - possibly loose from recently cleared fields - and created whiteout-like conditions, authorities said

All emergency services workers in the sparsely populated area of Humboldt County were called in after drivers reported 'near-apocalyptic' conditions on Monday evening

The carnage shut down the east-west corridor, a major trucking route, in both directions while workers cleared the scene of wrecked vehicles and debris.

One side reopened after 19 hours, while the other remained closed yesterday afternoon.

Chicago resident Ravi Dyer, 51, was killed when his truck rear-ended another commercial vehicle in the zero-visibility conditions, according to the Nevada Highway Patrol. 

Two other trucks hit his from behind, seriously injuring his passenger.

A Humboldt General Hospital spokeswoman said 26 people were treated at the hospital, including three in critical condition

Images from the scene showed crunched-up vehicles, at least one overturned SUV, and damaged big rigs with their loads spilling onto the road

Humboldt General Hospital spokeswoman Nicole Maher said 26 people were treated at the hospital, including three in critical condition who were later transferred to a hospital in much-larger Reno, about 160 miles away.

High winds at about 5pm on Monday 
whipped up dust — possibly loose from recently cleared fields — and 
created whiteout-like conditions, authorities said.

Vehicles, including 
semitrailers, passenger cars and a tow truck piled up in both 
directions.

Authorities identified the man killed during the massive pile-up as 51-year-old truck driver Ravi Dyer from Chicago

The Winnemucca Police Department brought in a police transport vehicle, and the Coach America charter bus company sent a vehicle to transport victims

A mine rescue crew from Newmont Mining Corp. assisted, along with the entire emergency room and operating room teams at the 52-bed Winnemucca hospital

Maher said that it took
about three and a half hours to remove one person from a vehicle.

Traffic was still being diverted more than 12 hours later, troopers said.

Hospital officials said the emergency response included some unusual helpers.
