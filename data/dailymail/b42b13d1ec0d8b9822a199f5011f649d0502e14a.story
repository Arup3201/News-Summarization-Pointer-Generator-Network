A high school student shot in the face by the Washington high school shooter Jaylen Fryberg miraculously escaped with his life after playing dead, MailOnline has learned.

Terrified Nate Hatch, 14, dropped to the ground in the cafeteria at Marysville-Pilchuck High School near Seattle, Washington after a bullet tore through his jaw.

But instead of screaming out in pain the brave teen lay still on the floor and pretended he was dead as the sound of bullets rang out around him, his grandfather has revealed.

Recovery: Nate (with Jaylen, left) is now walking and talking after his ordeal but still faces surgery on Thursday

Gunman Jaylen, who was Nate's cousin and best friend, was sitting with his friends at the school cafeteria during the lunch break last Friday when the 15-year-old suddenly opened fire with a handgun, killing two girls and injuring three others.

Homecoming prince Jaylen then turned the gun on himself as desperate students fled to safety following the massacre.

Police revealed on Monday that Jaylen had lured his victims to the ambush via text message.

Nate is still recovering at the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle but earlier Monday took to Facebook to update his friends.

He said he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was officially upgraded from serious to satisfactory.

Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, told MailOnline his grandson was 'walking and talking' but was still in recovery.

'He's getting along good, he's walking and talking which is great,' he said. 'Out of all of them he's in the best shape and we're all grateful for that.

'He was shot in the jaw and it shattered in a couple of places and the bullet came through his neck and hit his shoulder. But he's as good as he could be, I can't believe how fast he's healing.'

Mr Hatch said surgeons plan to operate on Nate's jaw this coming Thursday.

But tragically doctors have told Nate he won't be able to play his beloved football ever again.

'They told him he can't play any football any more, he's just finished with the football season and he's done,' said Mr Hatch. 'Obviously he's devastated about that. If somebody hits him good it will shatter his jaw.

'He was a defensive safety as well as running back, he loved to play and enjoyed hitting, but that's why he can't play.

'He played in the same team as Jaylen and Andrew who was also shot.'

But Mr Hatch said it isn't Nate's injuries that the family is worrying about, it's the emotional scarring he will likely suffer.

Forgiveness: Nate, pictured here at age 10, sent out tweets forgiving Jaylen. Family members said they were inseperable before the shooting

He said: 'Nate has been getting nightmares as you'd expect, that's what we're worried about, it is the emotional trauma what will need healing.'

Mr Hatch says the family, including Nate, are still looking for answers over the shooting.

The family has heard several theories including a feud over a girl and a row over football.

Nate's mom Denise and his two sisters are currently at Nate's bedside in hospital as he recovers.

Mr Hatch said: 'Nobody yet knows what happened and why. Nate was just sitting at a table and the guy got up and started shooting.

'He was sitting right across the table from him when he was shot. He was very lucky, everyone else got shot in the head, Nate was shot in the head but it was a glancing shot. He's a lucky kid.

'When he was on the ground he played dead, he just lay there until it was over.'

Mr Hatch, 75, said Nate's memory of the incident is slowly coming back.

He said the teen had written some notes to his family and in one it read: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'.

Mr Hatch added: 'I think Nate's getting his memory back. And it kind of broke his heart to hear what happened. He said, "why would my brother shoot me," even though they're cousins. "Why would my brother do that to me?" They were like brothers, they were so close.'

Scarred: Nate's grandfather, Don Hatch, told MailOnline: 'Nate has been getting nightmares as you'd expect, that's what we're worried about, it is the emotional trauma what will need healing'

Overcome: Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson (with her son above) has been 'hysterically crying'

Amazingly Nate even took to Twitter from his hospital bed to forgive his best friend Jaylen.

He wrote: 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw.

Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack.

Nate's aunt Paula Sateiacum told MailOnline that the three boys were 'inseparable'.

She said: 'They were like triplets. When you see one, you see all three. They did sports together, they did cultural stuff together, they were neighbors, all living within a block apart.'

Paula remembers Nate being brought home recently by the police after he and Jaylen had got in to trouble after riding quads bikes.

'That was the last I time I saw the boys together. They were bombing all around, on the main roads too, they were being boys. They were best friends.'

She added: 'It's amazing news that Nate is pulling through. The whole thing has been scary for the family. My older sister Denise is devastated, she was hysterically crying.'

It was revealed at the weekend that high school student Gia Soriano had died as a result of her injuries.

She was the second person to be confirmed dead as a result of the shooting after Zoe Galasso last week.

Their classmate and friend Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, remains in critical condition in intensive care at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett.

Since the shooting, it has emerged that Jaylen was left heartbroken after Zoe rebuffed him for his cousin Andrew.

In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!'

Friends say it was a reference to Andrew, 15, dating Zoe.

Earlier today police revealed that high-school freshman Jaylen had invited his victims to the cafeteria ambush by text message.

Fryberg did not leave behind a note and investigators are still combing through text messages to determine a motive. 'I don't know if the why is going to be something we can provide,' Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said.

But he said it was clear from the initial investigation that Fryberg targeted the victims.

'We know that the shooter had arranged to meet with friends at the lunch table,' he said. 'It's our understanding he did so by texting.'
