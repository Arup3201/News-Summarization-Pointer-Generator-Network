Poor: Scandal-plagued welfare-to-work provider, A4E has managed to get just 3.5 per cent of its job-seekers into long-term roles. Its chairman, Emma Harrison, is pictured

Scandal-plagued welfare-to-work provider, A4E has managed to get just 3.5 per cent of its jobseekers into long-term roles.

Fewer than four out of 100 unemployed people who have gone through the firm have secured jobs that last more than 13 weeks.

Almost 115,000 jobseekers were referred to A4e in the ten months to May 2012 under the government's work programme.

Of those, just 4,020 secured jobs that lasted more than three months, according to a Channel 4 News investigation.

The company has already been hit by damaging allegations of fraud.

Its chairman, Emma Harrison, who paid herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011 despite A4e's dreadful record, was forced to quit earlier this year.

The figures show that A4e - the second biggest provider of the work programme - is failing to meet its targets in the first year.

It has to get 5.5 per cent of its jobseekers into sustainable roles every year to keep its contract.

The 'expert' firm has even struggled to secure real jobs for applicants in the Olympic borough of Newham in East London, trailing behind even the local council.

While the borough has secured 5000 sustainable jobs through its own job support scheme, A4e has managed to get just 92 people out of 2,837 participants, into sustainable jobs.

The company also has contracts to help jobseekers in Merseyside, the East Midlands, South Yorkshire, Lancashire, the Thames Valley area and South Yorkshire.

In the Thames Valley Area, just 2.8 per cent of jobseekers secured long term roles while in East London, just 3.3 per cent got jobs that lasted more than 13 weeks.

Margaret Hodge, the chair of the public accounts committee, which has been investigating A4e, said the figures were 'abysmal'.

Mrs Hodge said: 'We have had a relentless stream of emails, brown envelopes from people...who have worked for A4e complaining about poor performance, allegations of fraud and malpractice.'

She added that taxpayers had a right to know if the firm was failing to meet its targets.

Current and former jobseekers involved with A4e told of their poor service at the company.

Karen Turner, another A4e 'customer' described the 'humiliating' process of being made to take a chlamydia test on her first day on the programme.

Philip Hammond, who is currently on the Work Programme in Bootle, Merseyside, described the programme as a 'scam', adding that the firm was 'not fit for purpose'.

He said he had only had two phone calls from the company in six months and had not been offered a single job interview.

According to calculations by Channel 4 News, under the terms of the Work Programme the company is likely to have received more than £45million in taxpayer funding.

The government and A4e refused to confirm the figures as they relate to the first 10 months of the first year of the contract, rather than the full 12 months.

A spokesman for A4e told Channel 4 News: 'The Official WP [work programme] statistics will be published in the autumn following rigorous auditing and data matching by DWP.

'As a provider, under the terms of our contract, we do not have permission to disclose or comment on performance data before that point.'

He added: 'The Work Programme is just one year into a five year, outcome based, programme. The statistical data will undergo robust validation in DWP, compiled and released in accordance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.

'Any data released before then is therefore unreliable and risks misleading the public as to the performance of the Work Programme.'

A Department of Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'The period covered by this data makes it virtually impossible for any provider to have built up a significant number of job outcome payments, most of which are only payable after someone has found a job and stayed in it for six months.

'To try to draw conclusions when most people have not even been on the programme for six months would be ludicrous.'
