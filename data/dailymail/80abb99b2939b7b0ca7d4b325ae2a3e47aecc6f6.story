A teenager who was stabbed on a family holiday has thanked the passing nurse who helped save his life when he was left with his 'intestines spilling out'.

Declan McNulty said he thought he had just been punched during the attack in Marmaris, Turkey, until he removed his hand from his stomach to see his insides spilling out of the wound.

The 18-year-old suffered damage to his stomach, liver and pancreas after the attack and was  left in intensive care after receiving several pints of blood during a ten-hour operation.

Declan McNulty said he thought he had just been punched during the attack in Marmaris, Turkey, until he removed his hand from his stomach to see his insides spilling out of the wound

The trainee sports coach from Leicester - who was on holiday with his parents and 15-year-old brother - was allegedly set upon during an argument about England and Scotland.

He said: 'I felt like I’d been punched in the stomach but as I took my hand away I could see my intestines hanging out.

“I went straight to the police and they just said I had a very big problem.

'Fortunately a passing nurse on holiday started compressing the wound and saved me.

'If it hadn’t been for her I think I would have bled out.'

After the attack, Declan was rushed to the private Ahu Hospital in Marmaris and was urgently operated on by Dr Ozgur Basaran.

Dr Basaran warned his parents - mother Helen, 47, and father Dave, 49 - that Declan’s condition was life-threatening.

The 18-year-old said: 'Despite them saying there will be long-term effects, I’ve still got to be careful.

'Just walking was a massive struggle at the time.

'But I wrote myself a training plan and now I’ve just got to keep working.'

His mother was so overcome by shock that she collapsed and had to be taken into the hospital on a stretcher.

She said: 'When the doctor told me it was life-threatening I didn’t know what to do.

'I don’t know how we can ever thank the surgeon, there are no words to say for what he’s done.'

His father Mr McNulty said he wanted to praise the surgeon, and also other people who had helped them.

He said: 'We can’t praise everyone in Turkey enough - from the hotel to the hospital to the police - they were amazing.

'Staff from the hotel even visited Declan in hospital.'

Josh
 Stevenson, a 19-year-old from Glasgow, has been charged with wounding 
with intent after the attack reportedly started after an England v 
Scotland argument.
