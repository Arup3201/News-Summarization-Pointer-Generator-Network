Alex Salmond has been accused of treating the Scottish Parliament with contempt by not going before MSPs today to explain his dealings with the Murdoch media empire.

Furious opposition politicians said the First Minister needs to answer questions over whether he had been prepared to intervene and lobby UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt on the proposed takeover of BSkyB.

It comes after an email from a senior figure at News Corporation claimed Mr Salmond would call Mr Hunt 'whenever we need him to'.

Under fire: Alex Salmond, pictured with Rupert Murdoch in 2007, has been accused of treating the Scottish Parliament with contempt by not going before MSPs today to explain his dealings with the Murdoch empire

During the Leveson Inquiry into press 
standards it emerged that News Corp's director of public affairs, 
Frederic Michel, had emailed James Murdoch and said: 'I met with Alex 
Salmond's adviser today. He will call Hunt whenever we need him to.'

A
spokesman for the First Minister insisted last night that Mr Salmond 
'has never spoken to or corresponded with Jeremy Hunt on this issue'.

He
said it was 'total nonsense to suggest there was ever any quid pro quo 
offered by the Scottish Government over the BSkyB bid'.

But opposition politicians said there were still questions the First Minister needed to answer.

Labour
leader Johann Lamont told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland: 
'He has not answered the question, did he make the offer to phone Jeremy
Hunt on behalf of News International.

'He has not answered that question. I think that is a fundamental question he should answer.'

She
added: 'There is grave concern that it would appear that Alex Salmond 
has used his office of First Minister to put his backing to a commercial
interest of Rupert Murdoch.

'The
idea of the First Minister of Scotland intervening with a Tory Cabinet 
secretary on what was a very sensitive issue seems to me to be 
remarkable.'

Mr Salmond is due to give a speech at the Institute of Directors in London today.

But Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he should be appearing before MSPs at Holyrood to answer questions on the issue.

Mr
Rennie told Good Morning Scotland that Mr Salmond was 'prepared to step
up and back the BSkyB bid on behalf of Rupert Murdoch'.

The Lib Dem leader claimed the relationship between the SNP leader and Rupert Murdoch and was 'far too cosy'.

He
added: 'It's an unhealthy one, it just shows that Alex Salmond is 
prepared to do anything to secure independence and I don't think that's 
what we want from a First Minister.'

Mr Rennie said the First Minister now 
'needs to explain what he was prepared to do in return for support from 
the Sun and the News of the World'.

He
added: 'He needs to explain that to Parliament and he needs to explain 
it today, at length, not in First Ministers Questions, because we 
actually need a proper exploration of the issues.

'The
fact that he is not prepared to come before the Parliament today shows 
the contempt he has for Parliament. He is prepared to spend yet more 
time in London than actually at the Scottish Parliament answering 
questions on this.

'But we 
need to get to the bottom of what his relationship was with Rupert 
Murdoch, whether he was prepared to do almost anything in return for 
support on independence and support for the SNP in the elections.'

Denial: A spokesman for Mr Salmond insisted that he 'has never spoken to or corresponded with Jeremy Hunt (pictured leaving his London office last night) on this issue'

Former Tory leader David McLetchie told BBC Radio Scotland: 'Alex Salmond and his political advisers were offering themselves as lobbyists on behalf of News Corporation into the BSkyB bid.

'It is that conduct that Mr Salmond has to answer for.'

Mr McLetchie, also speaking on Good 
Morning Scotland, accused the First Minister of 'hawking himself around 
as a lobbyist for the Murdoch empire'.

He
said that was a charge the First Minister had not denied, adding: 'He 
says he didn't actually do any lobbying but he has not denied making the
offer to do so.'

The 
Conservative MSP insisted that was 'inappropriate' behaviour, saying: 
'Broadcasting is a reserved issue, not a devolved issue.

'I'm afraid this sort of conduct simply portrays Mr Salmond as a man more than willing to suck up to the rich and famous.'

The row erupted as a result of James Murdoch's evidence to the Leveson Inquiry yesterday.

Shocking testimony: James Murdoch appears at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in London yesterday

Counsel to the inquiry Robert Jay QC had asked Mr Murdoch if the email to him from Mr Michel gave rise to the perception that favourable coverage of Mr Salmond in the Scottish Sun - which backed the SNP in last year's Holyrood elections - meant the First Minister would be more willing to call Mr Hunt 'whenever we need him to'.

Mr Murdoch, who stepped down as executive chairman of News International in February, replied: 'No, if the insinuation is that there was any quid pro quo with editorial coverage versus a commercial agenda, I can tell you categorically that it's false. There's no connection.

'That was absolutely not News Corporation's policy and I wouldn't do business like that.'

A spokesman for Mr Salmond said last night that the references to the First Minister 'in a handful out of hundreds of emails, represent internal chatter from within News International'.

He insisted: 'It is total nonsense to suggest there was ever any quid pro quo offered by the Scottish Government over the BSkyB bid, and nor could there possibly have been, because the Scottish Government had absolutely no determination over BSkyB's ownership.

'Indeed, James Murdoch categorically rejected such claims in his evidence to the inquiry, and the proof of that lies in the fact that the First Minister has never spoken to or corresponded with Jeremy Hunt on this issue.'

Mr Salmond had previously accepted an invitation to give evidence to the inquiry, and his spokesman said: 'He looks forward to attending and to reiterating these key points to the inquiry.'
