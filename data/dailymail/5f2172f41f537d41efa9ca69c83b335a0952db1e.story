Ticket touts have been accused of ‘disgusting’ behaviour after cashing in on a concert to raise money for charity.

Seats for The Cure’s London concerts in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust sold out within hours of being released - only to appear for resale for more than five times their face value.

At 9.30am today, all 10,000 tickets for the band’s two scheduled performances, on 28 and 29 March, were released for sale on the Royal Albert Hall website as well as Ticketmaster.co.uk, Gigsandtours.com and Seetickets.com.

All 10,000 tickets for The Cure, pictured, who are playing a concert in aid of The Teenager Cancer Trust, were sold within hours. Many were immediately put on secondary ticket selling sites for five times their value

The cheapest standing tickets were available for £27.50 with the most expensive box seats going for £137.50.

Snapped
 up in fewer than five hours, they immediately reappeared for sale on 
so-called ‘secondary ticketing sites’, including Viagogo, Seatwave, 
Stubhub (the ticketing arm of eBay), and Getmein – which itself is owned
 by Ticketmaster.

These 
sites allow those who have bought tickets to sell them second-hand at a 
price of their choice. The Cure tickets were on sale for between £149 
and £330.

Roger Daltrey, who
 curated the concerts on behalf of the Teenage Cancer Trust, condemned 
the touts and called for their behaviour to be made illegal.

In
 a statement to the Mail, the Who frontman said: ‘This is a major 
concern for the live performance arena and it becomes doubly painful 
when the shows concerned are for charity. The people who do this have to
 live with their consciences, knowing that the profit they have made 
could have gone to teenagers with cancer. ‘

He
 added: ‘We as a charity do an enormous amount of work to stop this 
happening. We work directly with the bands’ fan clubs to try and ensure 
that the real fans acquire the tickets. But until it is illegal to 
transfer tickets for extra money, there really isn’t much more we can 
do.’

Meanwhile, fans took to Twitter to express their rage. David Woosley from Liverpool branded the touts’ behaviour ‘disgusting’.

Siobhan
 Dunn, Chief Executive of Teenage Cancer Trust said: ‘It is wrong for 
individuals to hijack these efforts and personally profit by selling 
tickets on the secondary market.

 ‘We believe the only people entitled to profit from our event are young people with cancer.’

It is not the first time the behaviour of touts using the secondary sites has attracted criticism.

In
 November, there was outcry after all 20,000 tickets for Monty Python’s 
reunion performance sold out in three-quarters of a minute, only to 
reappear on the secondary market at more than 15 times their face value.

Ticketing
 expert Reg Walker, of the Iridium Consultancy, believes the only way 
the tickets could have sold out so quickly, only to reappear minutes 
later, is with the help of illegal, ticket-harvesting ‘botnet’ 
technology - computer programmes which work by inundating ticket 
providers with thousands of electronic requests at the same time, to buy
 tickets en masse.

‘It is 
highly likely that some of the methods used to harvest these tickets are
 illegal. The Teenage Cancer Trust event is targeted every year.’

Some
 MPs have accused the secondary sites of turning a blind eye to illegal 
behaviour. In December, Labour MP Sharon Hodgson and Conservative MP 
Mike Weatherley launched the All Party Ticketing Abuse Group to examine 
the issue.

They were due to have their first meeting this week, however all four major ticketing sites declined to send a representative.

Commenting
 on The Cure concert last night, Sharon Hodgson said: ‘Ticket touting 
goes on week in, week out, but it’s particularly sickening to see the 
goodwill of an artist and the fundraising efforts of a charity exploited
 for personal profit.

‘Fans,
 the live event industry and even the Police have all called on the 
Government to intervene in this shady and parasitical market. It’s high 
time Ministers finally listened, and took action to put fans first.’

The
 Cure’s gigs are part of a week-long series of performances at the Royal
 Albert Hall, curated by Daltrey. As well as The Cure, Suede, Ed 
Sheeran, Paolo Nutini and OneRepublic will all be appearing between 
March 24 and 30.

Since their launch in 2000, the Teenage Cancer Trust gigs have raised more than £17 million.
