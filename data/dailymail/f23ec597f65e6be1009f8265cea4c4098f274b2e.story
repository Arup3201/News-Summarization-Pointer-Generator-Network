Rugby league has broken new ground by unveiling a major sponsorship deal with a firm of bookmakers.

Ladbrokes have been announced by the Rugby Football League as the successors to Tetley's as sponsors of the Challenge Cup.

Having weaned itself off a reliance on alcohol and tobacco sponsorship, the RFL took a principled stance three years ago in rejecting an offer from gambling firm Betfair for the naming rights to Super League in favour of a cashless deal with Stobart.

That decision was taken following a personal plea by then RFL executive chairman Richard Lewis but the current regime at Red Hall have adopted a more pragmatic stance since he left to take up the role of chief executive of the All England Club at Wimbledon in April 2012.

Stobart were ditched after 12 months following pressure by the top-flight clubs and replaced as Super League sponsors by energy firm First Utility.

Tetley's were appointed as Challenge Cup sponsors two years ago, taking over from long-time backers Carnegie, and now the RFL has struck a deal with Ladbrokes following the expiry of the agreement with the brewery.

The deal is for three years and thought to be worth in excess of £1million a season.

RFL commercial director Chris Rawlings said: 'I am delighted to announce a three-year partnership that will see the sport's oldest and most prestigious competition become the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup.

'The Rugby League Challenge Cup is rich in heritage and tradition and it is both significant and fitting that the first Ladbrokes Challenge Cup final will be played on Founders Day.'

Richard Glynn, chief executive of Ladbrokes, said: 'We're thrilled to begin our sponsorship of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup in a historic and momentous year for the sport.

'Rugby league is without doubt one of the world's most exciting sports, brimming with energy and adrenaline both on and off the pitch.

'The fans are beyond passionate and that passion is infectious and spreading quickly across the globe. This exclusive deal will bring Ladbrokes unprecedented access to the action, which all of our customers have become accustomed to as part of The Ladbrokes Life.'

Forty amateur clubs, including representatives of the armed forces and the police, will go into the hat for the first-round draw at Wembley on Thursday and the 10 winning teams from the first two rounds will face Kingstone Press League 1 opposition in the third round in March.

Kingstone Press Championship clubs will enter the fray in the fourth round while the bottom four teams from the 2014 Super League enter in round five in April, with the top eight clubs including holders Leeds joining at the last-16 stage in May.

The final will be at Wembley on August 29.
