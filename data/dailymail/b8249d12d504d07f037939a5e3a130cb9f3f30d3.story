This burned out battery is what has caused a worldwide grounding of Boeing’s ‘revolutionary’ 787 Dreamliner jets.

Photographs of the charred remains of lithium ion batteries 
from two separate incidents resulting in the grounding of Japanese Boeing Dreamliners indicate it 
operated at a voltage above its design limit.

Today U.S. officials joined Japan's 
probe into the jets after all 50 of the 787s in use around the 
world have been stopped from flying.

Culprit: The Boeing 787's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes, which may have caused this battery fire on a Dreamliner at Logan Airport, Boston on January 7

The new generation of light lithium 
batteries was going to deliver equal power at half the weight, but it 
appears that the chemistry inside the ‘thermal runway’ can self-heat
if external temperature and pressure change, something which frequently 
occurs in aviation.

Concerns over the battery, 
prompted by an emergency landing of an All Nippon Airways plane on 
Wednesday, has seen the plane grounded across the globe.

The American investigators - one each 
from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation
 Safety Board and two from Boeing Co. - today inspected the ANA jet on the 
tarmac at Takamatsu airport in western Japan.

An initial inspection by Japanese 
officials of the 787 found that a flammable battery fluid known as 
electrolyte had leaked from the plane's main lithium-ion battery beneath
 the cockpit. It also found burn marks around the battery.

Eight airlines fly the ‘plastic 
plane’, so-called because its fuselage is ‘spun’ from super-strong but 
lightweight carbon fibre, which cuts weight and fuel consumption, rather
 than constructed from aluminium.

What are the problems with the new Dreamliner?

The 21st-century plane entered service in October 2011, three years late, following a spate of design and safety-related issues.

What are the safety issues?

Of foremost concern is the aircraft's lithium battery system. Lithium technology, which is used in electric cars and laptops, is considered potentially unsafe and has been known to start fires.

What were the other problems?

The first three 787s were found to be overweight. There were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the development of the on board software. Test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and Rolls Royce was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time.

In June 2010 Boeing stunned the aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after engineers discovered  structural flaws. Then in November that year a test flight had to make an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas, after crew notice smoke in the cabin.

Are they safe?

Boeing insists they are but is reviewing the plane's design and assembly together with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The company issued a statement saying they stand behind the 787's overall integrity.

Chief executive Jim McNerney said in a statement. 'We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the travelling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service.'

What does it mean for Boeing?

Boeing shares fell 2 per cent on Wednesday and are expected to fall further. Some experts have suggested the 787, which has a list price of $207 million, may never make a profit. The manufacturer faces stiff competition from European firm Airbus who build the Superjumbo, the world's largest passenger aircraft.

Why have airlines rushed to buy the 787?

The Dreamliner has the longest range of any passenger jet. More significantly it is the most efficient, this is vitally important as fuel costs now represent airlines' largest expenditure.

Passenger comfort is also paramount with bigger windows, more room for carry-on baggage, and lower cabin pressurisation to make long flights more bearable. 787s also have wider aisles and higher ceilings and offer a smoother, quieter journey.

British Airways has ordered 24 and 
holiday firm Thomson Airways has ordered 8 of the planes – with their 
deliveries starting from next month – but say they are standing by the 
stricken airliner.

Thomson is scheduled to be the first British flyer of
 Dreamliners in May.

GS Yuasa Corp., the maker of the 
lithium-ion batteries used in the 787s, said Thursday it was helping 
with the investigation but that the cause of the problem was unclear.

It
 said the problem could be the battery, the power source or the 
electronics system.

European air safety bosses acted just 
hours after America’s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued an 
‘Emergency Airworthiness Directive’ to halt flights of the planes - the 
first time a fleet of aircraft has been grounded across the world in 34 
years.

The FAA’s emergency  directive said 
the action was ‘prompted by recent incidents involving  lithium ion 
battery failures that resulted in the release of flammable electrolytes,
 heat damage and smoke’ on two aircraft.’

It said: ’The cause of  these failures
 is currently under investigation’ but warned more ominously:

’These 
conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical 
systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical 
compartment.’

The decision to ground the 50 planes currently 
in service is a humiliating blow to the world’s 
biggest aircraft maker, which has seen its shares plummet since the emergency ANA jet emergency landing on Wednesday.

Some 137 passengers and crew members on an All Nippon Airlines
 flight were evacuated down escape chutes when smoke was detected on 
board.

The Dreamliner is the first airliner 
to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries.

They charge faster and 
can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other 
aeroplane batteries.

But the electrolyte fluid also 
conducts electricity, so as it spreads it can cause short-circuits and 
ignite fires.

Its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a 
leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane.

Paul Czysz, professor emeritus of 
aeronautical engineering at St. Louis University said:

‘Unfortunately, 
what Boeing did to save weight is use the same batteries that are in the
 electric cars, and they are running into the same problems with the 787
 as the problems that have shown up in electric cars.’

The battery fire is just one of  a 
series of problems  - including  two fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake
 computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which 
got off to a bad start when launched three years late.

The plane made the landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also detected in the cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines have grounded their entire fleets of the problematic aircraft

Both Japan and the United States have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns

Among the 50 planes grounded are the 
six Dreamliners owned by United Airlines, the only U.S. airline to 
operate the plane. The Indian government also ordered Air India to 
ground its fleet of six 787s.

The two Dreamliners owned by Poland’s LOT Airlines were also grounded alongside the 24 in Japan. 

On Wednesday a Qatar airlines 787 flight from London’s Heathrow airport was also cancelled ahead of the global grounding.

All will be subject to strict safety tests before being allowed to take off again.

Plunge: Shares in Boeing have fallen by 6.3 per cent over the last two days wiping an estimated $2.7 billion off the company's stock market value

Jim McNerney, Boeing's chairman, 
president and CEO, said the company is working with the FAA to resolve 
the situation as quickly as possible.

'We are confident the 787 is safe and 
we stand behind its overall integrity,' he said in a statement.

'We will
 be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our 
customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the
 airplanes to service.'

Mike Sinnett, chief engineer on the 
787, said last week that the plane's batteries have operated through a 
combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault.

He said they
 were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put
 the airplane at risk'.
