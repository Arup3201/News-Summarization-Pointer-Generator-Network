A plane's take-off was delayed on Friday because its pilot didn't want to run over a six-inch garter snake.

Delta Airlines Flight 1859's departure from San Francisco International Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was delayed by the small snake, an airline source confirmed to MailOnline.

The flight's passengers shared news of their delay on Twitter - including efforts to 'bag' the snake.

As noted by SFist, San Francisco garter snakes are endangered.

SFO spokesman John Ginty told the New York Post, which first revealed the story, that the snake was picked up off of the runway and that the delay was extremely short.

'I don't think it was delayed at all,' he told the paper.

Despite the incident, the Delta flight arrived on time, the airline source confirmed to MailOnline.Â
