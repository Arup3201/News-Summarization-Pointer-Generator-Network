A strange vehicle has appeared in a Chinese town centre which appears to have been created out of several motors – and a building site hut.

Police in Chongqing, China are looking for the owner of a truck made out of a cut up mini bus and a storage unit similar to the temporary buildings found on construction sites.

The unusual motor was abandoned in the town centre weeks ago and has yet to be claimed.

Mystery truck: The abandoned lorry-like vehicle appears to have been made from a separate storage unit and a cab cut into a tiny drivers space

The truck has no seats or doors, and how the driver is meant to fit in between the wheel and the storage unit is still a mystery.

As there is nowhere to sit, it seems 
the driver would be forced to steer from beside the wheel, or open 
what appears to be a door on the misfitting storage unit.

Police in the southwest city of  Chongqing first received reports about the bizarre truck a few weeks ago but no owner has yet to come forward.

Cramped: The truck has no doors, no seats and how a driver is supposed to fit in between the storage and the wheel remains a mystery

Left to rust: The vehicle was found abandoned in Chongqing, China where police are now attempting to track down the owner

Mismatched: The storage space resembles temporary construction site huts which appears to have been attacked to a cut-up mini bus
