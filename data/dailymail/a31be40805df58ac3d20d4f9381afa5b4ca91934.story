Former boxer Jamie Moore has vowed to complete the Great North Run next year – despite currently struggling to walk even 100 metres after being shot in August.

The one-time European light-middleweight champion almost died when hit twice in the left leg by a mystery gunman in a case of mistaken identity in Marbella.

Moore is now undergoing a long and painful rehabilitation where even walking short distances leaves the 35-year-old in agony.

But Moore insists nothing will stop him completing the North East's famous half-marathon for kids' Neuroblastoma charity Niamh's Next Step, of which he is a patron, next September – no matter how long it takes or how much it hurts him.

The married dad-of-two told Fubar Radio's Weekend Hangover Show: 'I am making good progress, but it is a long old road, a painstaking process.

'I think people see me up and around they think I am back to normal. I am nowhere near that.

'Nerves rehabilitate at roughly one millimetre a day. My nerve damages travels from my knee to the tops of my toes – so you're probably talking 12 to 18 months before I am back anywhere near where I was.

'Although I can get around and do some stuff, walking is a struggle. I can walk slowly with a foot brace on but it is painful, an effort.

'I have to intentionally force my left leg to move. Every step I take on my left foot is a conscious effort. For me to walk 100 metres is a real effort.

'But I will definitely complete the Great North Run.

'Even if I don't get any better than I am now, I will be doing it. Even if I have to walk 13 miles, I will do it.

'Even if I have to force my left leg to walk every step, I will do it because I am stubborn like that. There is nothing that can stop me.

'My goal will be to do it for the kids at Niamh's Next Step. A lot of young children get Neuroblastoma and it is a horrible, aggressive form of cancer.

'These kids go through hell trying to get rid of it and going though chemotherapy. That will be my driving force.

'So firstly, the aim is to get myself right physically and to the point where I can do it, and when it is hurting and getting difficult my driving force will be to do it for the kids who have Neuroblastoma to give them maybe a better life before their lives are taken away, or to give them a better rehabilitation.'

To give an idea of how difficult Moore still finds walking, he was left in agony when he agreed to take his nine-year-old son Mikey sightseeing in London last weekend.

The 35-year-old says nothing will stop him competing in the famous Great North Run next year 

He recalled: 'I was working in the corner for Ricky Boylan's fight, and my son had never been to London before.

'He said, "Will you take me for a walk around London?" For me to walk 100 metres is a real effort, but I will do anything for him.

'So I took him on the Underground, into Piccadilly Circus, and it absolutely killed me.

'It was so painful but I wanted to do it for him. It didn't matter how much pain I was in.

'People think I am better than I actually am, but I am far from better and it is going to take a long, long while.'
