Russian spies will break into the hotel rooms of visiting British businessmen, tap their phones and hack their laptops, according to a stark warning from the Foreign Office.

An updated risk assessment published last week alerts travellers that Vladimir Putin’s agents could follow or film them, search their cars and offices or approach their staff.

The new guide adds that corruption is ‘endemic’ in Russia and there is a ‘high threat’ from terrorism as well as ‘human rights’ breaches.

Warning: David Cameron's government has stepped up tensions with Putin by warning British businessmen to look out for Russian spies tapping their phones, hacking their laptops, and searching their offices

It states: ‘Business people need to be conscious of the following activities of the local security service (FSB).

'IT attack against computers, laptops and other electronic devices; physical, audio and video surveillance; approaches to staff; interception of telephone calls, texts, emails, fax and post.'

It also warned of 'searches of offices, homes, vehicles and hotel rooms.’

Britain has denounced Russia's 'bullying' of Ukraine, accused it of arming the militias that shot MH17

It is the latest evidence of the freeze in relations between Westminster and the Kremlin.
