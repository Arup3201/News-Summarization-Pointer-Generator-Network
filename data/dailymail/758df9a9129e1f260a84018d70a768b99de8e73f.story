Incredible footage has emerged of punches being thrown as riot police clashed with student protesters gathered at Sydney University on Thursday night to confront Education Minister Christopher Pyne over cuts announced in last week's Federal Budget.

Students bearing signs and placards chanted outside the University's St John's College hall where Mr Pyne was adjudicating the The Howard Debating Cup, hosted by Sydney University Liberal Club.

In a video uploaded to YouTube a police officer appears to throw a punch at a male student then shove a female student backwards, as fellow students chanted what has become the catch-cry of recent protests: 'No cuts, No fees, No corporate universities'.

In unrelated incidents, others claim to have been assaulted by uniformed officers.

Students who were at the protests shared their experience on social media with one woman tweeting: 'I was exercising my right to demonstrate and a riot cop punched me in the face harder than I've ever been hit #stjohnsgate.

Another said: 'Pretty shaken up after being shoved around by riot cops. Solidarity and love to all those still there #pyneatusyd.'

The footage shows protesters scuffling with one officer, and others approach the students and tell them to 'back off.'

Soon after, a group of police have created a blockage and a cop on the far left of the line looks to take a swing at a male demonstrator wearing a pink shirt.

He can then be seen pushing other students, male and female, and police continue to shout 'Get back! Get back!'

The same member of police then stands with his arms outstretched trying to stop people entering the hall, and forcefully sends another student, possibly female and wearing a backpack flying backwards with a strong push.

Students can then be seen retracting from the line of riot police, though can still be heard chanting and yelling.

ABC reporter Ben Worsley was at the demonstration at Sydney University, and said that a number of protesters were pushed to the ground by officers.

'Within two or three minutes a heavy police presence arrived, probably a couple of dozen police approached the protesters,' Worsley said.

'A number of the protesters were pushed to the ground quite forcefully but the group has refused to leave,' the ABC report.

The University of Sydney's SRC newspaper Honi Soit were tweeting as the events were unfolding, which prompted others to join the discussion.

Their feed recorded profanities and chants being shouted during the protests, photos of police blocking entrances into St John's College, and revealed that students believe Pyne had to be ushered into the building via and alternative entrance.

At 8.30pm, 15 protesters remained outside the college, quietly waiting for Mr Pyne to come out.

They were debating whether to stay or call it a night, as six police watched on. In total, about 35 police were scattered around the building, guarding its exits.

Vice-president of the University of Sydney Union and Greens member Tom Raue was waiting with the crowd.

The 23-year-old said students were angry with the 'appalling' budget and wanted to remind Liberals that the cuts would not go unnoticed by "working class and vulnerable people".

'Students are going to fight back against the budget and disrupt [Liberals] wherever they go,' he told AAP.

He criticised police for being 'quite violent' but acknowledged no arrests had been made yet.

Christopher Pyne is said to have left the university just before 9pm.

Senators George Brandis and Mitch Fifield, and Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson were also on the guest list.

The Sydney University Liberal Club condemned the 'violent riot' in a statement on Facebook.

President Alex Dore blamed 'extremist' students for interrupting the club's annual John Howard Debating Cup.

They had nothing better to do than to disrupt civil debate with their militant tactics, he said.

'The extreme left students chants of `Chris Pyne f*** you', `Pyne is a w*nker' is offensive and has no place in civil society.'

The event takes place a day after Mr Pyne and Prime Minister Tony Abbott cancelled a Deakin University appearance because of security concerns.
