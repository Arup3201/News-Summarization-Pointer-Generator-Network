The key to keeping costs down in the NHS is to prevent people from having to go to hospital in the first place, according to a major report.

The amount of money needed to run the health service is soaring due to the demands of an ageing and more obese population who are succumbing to illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

But NHS chief Simon Stevens said part of the solution would be to prevent patients becoming ill in the first place – namely by tackling obesity.

He wants firms to reward staff with iPads, cash prizes or vouchers for losing weight.

He is also urging them to hold Weight Watchers sessions and lunchtime running clubs for staff as part of a drive to tackle obesity.

In return, they should receive Government tax breaks, he said.

The plans are contained in a report on reducing the number of people admitted to hospital in a bid to slash NHS costs. Other measures include:

Mr Stevens warns in his report that unless the NHS receives more money from the Government – or makes drastic savings – it will have an annual deficit of £30billion by 2020.

In particular, he wants companies to run schemes whereby staff are rewarded with iPads, shopping vouchers or cash prizes if staff meet certain goals on weight loss.

He is also urging them to hold Weight Watchers classes and running clubs and to encourage staff to walk and cycle to work.

Firms would receive tax breaks from the Government and would also receive some funding to set up slimming or exercise classes.

One way to reduce the strain on the NHS would be to prevent patients becoming ill in the first place – namely by tackling obesity

Mr Stevens himself managed to lose nearly three stone thanks to a weight-loss incentive scheme at his previous job, the US insurance firm United Healthcare.

The report also includes plans to recruit an army of volunteers to help feed elderly dementia patients in hospital or care for them at home.

These members of the public would then get 10 per cent off their annual council tax bill – as much as £200 depending on where they live.

It does not yet specify how much voluntary work would need to be done to be entitled to this benefit or the exact tasks entailed.

Mr Stevens wants to avoid patients having to go to hospital wherever possible by improving health services closer to home.

He said: ‘There are big changes to the way in which care is going to be provided and that is going to take national and local efforts. The NHS is now at a crossroads - as a country we need to decide which way to go.

‘It is perfectly possible to improve and sustain the NHS over the next five years in a way that the public and the patients want.’

Referring to obesity, he added: ‘We’re going to absolutely have to up our game across the board in terms of prevention and public health.

‘The large increase in obesity is associated in large rise in diabetes and we are now spending £10billion a year treating diabetes.’
