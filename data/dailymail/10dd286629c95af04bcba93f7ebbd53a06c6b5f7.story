Nine out of ten children under two have had the MMR jab – the highest rate for 14 years.

The numbers are almost back to the point they were at before the scare that put many parents off giving their children the vaccine.

Altogether 91.2 per cent of those under two had received their first dose of the MMR vaccine last year, an increase from 89.1 per cent in 2010-11.

Children should receive their first dose of MMR vaccine between 12 and 13 months

This is the first time the figure has
hit the 90 per cent rate since 1997-98,  when 90.8 per cent of children
had been protected from measles, mumps and rubella.

It is slightly below the peak in 
1995-96 of 91.8 per cent, according to figures from the Health and 
Social Care Information Centre.

Many parents refused to have their 
children vaccinated after Dr Andrew Wakefield’s 1998 research linked the
MMR jab with autism. His study has since been discredited.

Children should receive their first 
dose of MMR between 12 and 13 months and then a second dose between 
three years four months and five years.

Experts welcomed the increase but 
pointed out it is still short of the World Health Organisation’s target 
of at least 95 per cent of children being vaccinated.

In London the figure is significantly lower, with just 86.1 per cent of children under two having the first MMR jab in 2011-12.

The uptake was highest in Thames Valley, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight where 93.5 per cent of children were vaccinated, according to the HSCIC’s NHS immunisation statistics report.

The uptake of the vaccination programme has varied over the last two decades.

HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'Our annual figures have tracked the course of immunisation coverage for several vaccines for children over the years including that for measles, mumps and rubella.

'Today’s report marks a significant point in the continued rise of MMR coverage since it hit a low in 2003-04 - as for the first time in 14 years nine out of 10 children in England have had the MMR vaccine before they turn two.

'However, although MMR coverage at two years has risen in all regions of England, and overall the country’s coverage has increased in recent years, the national figure remains below the WHO target of at least 95 per cent.'

Prof Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Bristol, said the upward trend for MMR uptake was encouraging.

However, he added: 'Measles cases are still occurring at much higher levels than previously. There are a lot of older children of different ages out there who missed one or both MMR doses over the last 15 years and they are vulnerable and able to pass the infection on to others.

'Measles is extremely infectious and only with continuous vaccine uptake rates at 95 per cent and above over many years can it come under effective control. We also need to keep our eyes open for cases of mumps and rubella and congenital rubella going forward.

'Any parents who decided against MMR in the past should now reconsider having their children immunised and contact their GP.'
