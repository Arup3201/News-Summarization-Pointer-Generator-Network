Three people have been sent to prison and another two are awaiting sentencing for their roles in a horrific assault on a 53-year-old man, who was beaten, tied to a chair,  and covered in offensive tattoos.

A Philadelphia court heard Thursday that Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, was the ringleader of the gang, who have become known as the 'tattoo terrorists'.

Campbell believed the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat, Pebbles.

Valecce, an unemployed drug addict, had been staying in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, in the city's northeast, however that basement would become a torture chamber where he would be strapped to a chair and violated for three days.

Accomplices: Sandra Ng, 19 (left), Campbell's girlfriend, was sentenced to 23 months in state prison for her role in the shocking assault last year, while another defendant Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial

Campbell apparently discovered that Pebbles had suffered a broken leg and had reason to believe Valecce was responsible. 

The incident occurred in late March 2014, according to Philly.com. 

Campbell, his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, cornered Valecce in the basement and took turns punching, slapping and spitting on him.

On top of hurting Pebbles, Campbell believed Valecce had also stolen money and some weed.

The trio, described by the paper as 'wannabe gangsters', filmed the abuse, with the video played in court this week.

'Please stop,' Valecce could be heard saying while crying into his hands.

'Please, please stop.'

Ng could be heard in every video screaming at Valecce to stand up, so she could pummel him and call him a 'b----'. 

After Valecce was beaten he was tied to a chair.

While restrained Campbell tattooed 'RIP Pebbles' onto his right arm along with a smiley face that had breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose.

Halin then took over the tattoo gun.

He inked swastikas, Stars of David, two variations of the N-word and a penis ejaculating on a rainbow with the words 'Gay Pride' beside it, Philly.com reported. 

Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists and fractured bones in his face. 

He was able to escape on April 1 while the others slept and contact police.

The incident lasted about 42 hours, the court was told. 

Scene: The abuse occurred in the basement of a rowhouse on Brighton Ave, Mayfair in north Philadelphia

Dur­ing a search of the house, po­lice al­legedly found a tat­too gun, needles, ink vi­als and re­lated paraphernalia, along with 155 grams of marijuana, sev­er­al bottles of pre­scrip­tion drugs and Valecce's deb­it card, which he claimed had been stolen from him.

Valecce has since had the tattoos removed, with a local parlor giving him free service, but says the incident has left him with irrevocable damage.

'I'm scared to go outside now,' Valecce told Common Pleas Court Judge Charles Ehrlich Thursday. 

'I have nightmares. I can't sleep.' 

All three were charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy and false imprisonment.

They all pleaded guilty. 

Campbell's attorney said his client had a rough childhood, with his father leaving, suicide attempts and dependencies on Xanax and weed. 

He was sentenced to 20 years in state prison.

Halin received the same sentence for what he did to Valecce. 

Ng, whose attorney who said she had fallen in with the wrong people at school, was sentenced to 23 months in a state prison.  

Another man involved, David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, while another defendant Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial.
