Dr Elena Martellozzo of Middlesex University tracked the home address of 15 children with just their names using their parents' Facebook updates

Parents are putting children at risk of abuse by posting too much personal information online, a criminologist has warned.

Elena Martellozzo carried out a trial and just knowing a name is enough to find the home addresses, personal details and pictures of most youngsters.

The expert, who advises Scotland Yard on sex offenders’ use of the internet, said children tend to be more savvy than adults.

More often than not it was information posted on sites such as Facebook by naive parents that made it so easy to identify their offspring.

Dr Martellozzo said parents ‘want to say how wonderful their children are but they are not aware of how much they are putting them at risk’.

She urged them to keep their children safe by not posting their address, the name of their school or details about birthdays.

For her project, Dr Martellozzo, of Middlesex University, was given the names of 15 children in Manchester whom she had never met or seen. She said: ‘I could easily get to their homes just through some easy research and it was because their parents kept posting info about them.’

Many teachers feel parents rely on them to help pupils use the web safely but Dr Martellozzo said this was a family responsibility.
