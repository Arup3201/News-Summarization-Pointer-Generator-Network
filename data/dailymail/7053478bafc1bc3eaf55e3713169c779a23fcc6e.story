A beach hut is on sale for £225,000 despite not having mains electricity, running water, or - and some would say this one's pretty crucial - a sea view.

The 13ft by 13ft timber shack on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, is divided into a living area, bedroom and mezzanine and is one of the most expensive beach huts ever to go on sale.

But although glimpses of the sea can be seen from side windows, its front porch looks out on little more than sand dunes and grass - and there's a public toilet round the back.

Room with a loo: A beach hut on Dorset's Mudeford Spit is on sale for £225,000 despite not having mains electricity, running water or a sea view - and it's next to a toilet

The sea? Oh, it's just over there: The hut's furnishings are slightly dated compared to others, and it faces sand dunes, but it's one of the largest on the peninsula

It also requires a half-hour walk or a ride on a novelty tourist 'land train' from the nearest parking space.

At the same price as a detached house in Hull - which costs on average £218,000 - it outstrips the highest previous selling price for a hut on the spit by £55,000.

Sold in 2012, the 18ft by 10ft timber retreat which held the previous record was shifted just two days after it went on sale amid bidding frenzy.

For less than the hut now on sale, buyers could snap up a five-bedroom detached house in the south Wales village of Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil, which is on sale for £199,950.

Or for £180,000 they could buy an entire church 'with conversion potential' in almost an acre of land in the village of Farr, near Inverness.

But the estate agents selling this chalet insisted it was worth the price because it is one of the largest on the peninsula - which, like nearby Sandbanks, has become a premium spot for buying seaside homes.

Upstairs, downstairs: Estate agent Andy Denison said the hut's value was increased by having a mezzanine level. It is one of the most expensive ever to go on the market

Kitchen: The hut has no mains electricity, but it does feature this charming gas hob, and there's even a fridge. It's claimed the chalet sleeps 10, at a push

Both areas have a 'perfect storm' of factors which push up prices, including that they are situated between harbours and the sea, have been largely owned within families and there is no room left for any new buyers to expand onto the narrow strips of land.

The public toilet could also, in fact, come in useful - as the hut and others like it don't have one of their own.

At a stretch: The sea is visible by standing on the steps and craning one's neck

Andy Denison, of Denisons Estate 
Agents, said: 'The hut has been in the same family for donkey’s years and it 
has got potential for people to put their own style on it.

'It has a living space, an integral bedroom and a mezzanine level and can sleep up to 10 people. It
 features 12 volt solar electricity through solar panels on the roof and
 has lighting, a fridge and a cooker which is run by gas.

'Bigger hits at Mudeford tend to have a mezzanine floor and the value seems to increase because of it. This
 is a good size hut and I think that’s where the value is, it’s suitable
 for a larger family or for friends which much be sharing it.'

He added: 'The
 hut has sea glimpses as it is set back about 30 yards from the 
beach. There is nothing in front of it but grass, sand, and a path.'

As well as the hefty price tag, the 
new owners will have to pay a £15,000 transfer fee and more than 
£2,600 a year in ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council.

In order to see the sea, the new 
owners of the beach hut will need to stand on the top step leading up to
 the decking and then look towards the left.

If it sells for the asking price, the cabin will just fall short of becoming the most expensive beach hut ever sold in Britain.

Another on the Strand in Shaldon, south Devon, sold for £245,000 in 2012 despite being just 6ft wide.

But unlike the Mudeford Spit huts, it was a new build with under-floor heating, a marble wet room, wireless internet, and electric windows which automatically close when it rains. Measuring 23ft long, it also boasted a fitted kitchen, a rear patio, TV, DVD and one mezzanine bedroom.

Steve Barratt, chairman of the 
Mudeford Sandbank Beach Hut Association, said: 'Back in the 1980s, the 
beach huts would have sold for around £6,000 or £7,000.

'Now,
 people are paying around £150,000 for one. Compared to how house 
prices have changed, there’s a significant difference.

'Beach huts have outstripped property prices over the years by several times.'

Picturesque: The quiet village of huts is on a peninsula with Christchurch harbour on one side and the English Channel on the other, and cannot be reached by cars

Spending a lot more than a penny: The hut, pictured in green, is right next to a public toilet block - useful if nature calls while the 10 people squeezed in are sleeping

Idyll: Thanks to its secluded sense of calm and good sizes by beach huts standards, Mudeford Spit has become one of Britain's priciest areas by cost per square foot

Many luxury beach huts on the market cost more than a brand new, fully-functioning home. In the last few months some beach huts across Britain have been marketed for vast amounts.

They included a hut on Chesil beach near Weymouth, which featured in the title of a novel by Ian McEwan, which went on the market for £300,000.

In Christchurch, Dorset, there are beach huts up for sale for £225,000, with some estate agents marketing them as 'one-bedroom terraced properties'.

But there are bargains to be had. In Felixstowe, Suffolk, the cheapest beach huts are on the market for £7,000 while in Hove, East Sussex, one hut was recently on sale for £14,000.

Another, in a prime position on the seafront at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, was on the market two weeks ago for £18,000, decorated in pastel colours with a 1950s floral interior.
