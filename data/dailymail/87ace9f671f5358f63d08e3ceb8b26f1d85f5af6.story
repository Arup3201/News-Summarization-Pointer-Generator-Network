An American couple were violently ill throughout a 20-hour flight home after they caught a vomiting bug at one of Heston Blumenthal restaurants.

David Jones, 39, and his wife Melissa, 38, spent £277.66 on the meal at Dinner, the two Michelin-starred venue in Hyde Park, London, where they ate delicacies such as calf tail and powdered duck breast to mark the end of their holiday.

But 48 hours later, as they flew back to Denver, the couple were struck down by norovirus.

Blumenthal closed the restaurant on 
Saturday, after tests confirmed an outbreak of the bug. Norovirus forced
 a similar closure of Blumenthal's other restaurant, The Fat Duck in 
Bray, five years ago.

Mr Jones, an IT Consultant told the Evening Standard he was violently ill 'on a reasonably frequent basis' during the flight to Denver.

He
 said: 'It was not good. At one point I had a chill, but no fever and my
 wife said I looked extremely pale. It was not a lot of fun.'

He
 added: 'We were quite excited about going there. I had a group of 
friends who had been there the week before and raved about it and that 
added to my excitement.

'It's
 never a good thing to go through that experience, especially at a 
restaurant like that. I'll definitely be back to the UK, but maybe not 
to Heston's."

Blumenthal, 
known as the 'culinary alchemist', apologised to customers at the 
Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park Hotel when he closed the restaurant on 
Saturday, after 24 diners and 21 members of staff were taken ill.

The chef said: 'My goal has always been to pursue perfection in 
the kitchen and to amaze our guests with taste sensations beyond their 
imagination, rather than expose them to the risk of a really nasty 
couple of days of heaving.'

He added: 'I personally have the experience and knowledge about this winter bug and how to contain it immediately.

'I
 am very sorry for the inconvenience to those customers affected by the 
cancellations. However, I will reopen the restaurant safe in the 
knowledge that we have done everything we can do to continue to strive 
to create the perfect environment and food for my guests to enjoy. I 
will always err on the side of extreme caution.'

The restaurant is expected to remain closed this week.

Hailed
 by food critics as ‘astonishing’ and ‘seriously good’, Dinner has been 
rated by experts as one of the world’s finest restaurants.

Mr
 Blumenthal, who was criticised for reacting too slowly when his 
flagship restaurant The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, was hit by a worse 
outbreak, said the temporary closure of Dinner might seem ‘rather 
extreme and over cautious’.

The chef, famous 
for his experimental cooking, said the problem came to light two weeks 
ago when a guest reported feeling unwell with symptoms consistent with 
the norovirus winter vomiting bug.

The restaurant, in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, immediately called in Westminster Council environmental health officers and nine further reports of illness were recorded.

Mr Blumenthal, whose restaurant caters for about 1,000 people a week and where a meal for two can cost £190, said the complaints peaked after a couple of days and tests made by Westminster officials came back negative.

According to a food website, Westminster
 food safety officers have confirmed there had been an outbreak of the 
bug and were quoted as saying: ‘We have asked the restaurant to improve 
some of its hygiene procedures – including telling staff to wash their 
hands more often. The changes were made immediately.’

In one of the largest known outbreak of the bug in a restaurant, more than 240 people were affected by norovirus at The Fat Duck. 

The restaurant, which has three Michelin stars and was voted the best restaurant in the world in 2005, was accused of waiting six weeks after the first suspected case before reporting it to the Health Protection Agency, though managers rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing.

A spokesman for The Fat Duck said at the time that the outbreak had been caused by ‘oysters contaminated at source by norovirus.’

The establishment reopened after a ten-day investigation. 

Norovirus is the most common stomach bug in the UK. It is highly contagious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea. If an infected person does not wash their hands before handling food, they can pass the virus on. It can also be spread from contaminated surfaces and equipment.
