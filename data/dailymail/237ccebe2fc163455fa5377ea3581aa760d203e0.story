Dominant player: Visa issues about 41 per cent of all payment cards in Europe

Shoppers are being being charged over the odds because of the fees Visa charges to process cross-border credit card transactions, the European Union claimed today.

EU regulators have sent a complaint to the company, which issues about 41 per cent of all payment cards in Europe, saying its charges harm competition between banks.

Retailers pay a fee to to their bank every time a card is used to pay for a product. The bank then pays Visa for the transaction to be processed.

The EU Competition Commission said the company's cross-border consumer credit card fees in Europe breach EU rules and leave retailers paying too much to get payments processed.

Visa Europe, the largest card network in the 27-country European Union, cut its debit card fees in December 2010 to settle a competition probe by the European Commission into that part of its business.

However it has held out against doing the same for its credit card fees.

The commission said its charge sheet or 'statement of objections' sent to Visa Europe also covers domestic credit card fees in eight EU countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden.

'Visa's MIFs (multilateral interchange fees) harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase consumer prices,' the EU watchdog said in a statement.

Visa Europe, which is owned and operated by more than 3,700 European member banks, said it regretted the Commission's decision.

'We are very disappointed that the Commission has taken such a confrontational approach and was not willing to find a solution to support investment and innovation in European payments for the benefit of European consumers and to allow European payments to compete globally,' Visa Europe's chief executive Peter Ayliffe said in a statement.

The company could face fines of up to 10 per cent of its global turnover if found in breach of EU antitrust regulations. It posted record revenues of 1billion euros (Â£782billion) last year.

Europe's second-highest court in May backed the EU regulator's crackdown on card fees in a case involving Mastercard, the world's second-biggest credit and debit card network operator.

Visa Europe's credit and debit cards account for about 41 per cent of all payment cards issued in Europe.
