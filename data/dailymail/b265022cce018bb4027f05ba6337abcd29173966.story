John Carver looks set to remain in charge of Newcastle United this week, despite the club holding talks with Remi Garde.

Magpie officials, led by managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr, spoke with Garde in London over the weekend.

However, Sportsmail understands he is not the only candidate for the head coach vacancy at St James' Park.

John Carver has been caretaker manager of Newcastle since the departure of Alan Pardew 

Former Lyon coach Remi Garde is the favourite to take over as head coach of Newcastle

And there is a suggestion that former Arsenal midfielder Garde, who stepped down as boss of Lyon at the end of last season to take a sabbatical, would prefer to wait until the summer before taking up the role.

That is also the case with French compatriot Christophe Galtier, who insists he will not walk out on Saint-Etienne in the middle of the season, especially not with his side having climbed to third in Ligue 1 at the weekend.

It means that Carver will almost certainly be in the dugout when Southampton visit Tyneside on Saturday.

Pardew steered Crystal Palace to a 2-1 win over Tottenham in his first Premier League game on Saturday

He would be willing to take the reins until the end of the season and would like to remain at the club whatever direction the hierarchy take with their appointment.

Garde's situation, meanwhile, is complicated slightly by some of his preferred backroom team still being under contract at Lyon.
