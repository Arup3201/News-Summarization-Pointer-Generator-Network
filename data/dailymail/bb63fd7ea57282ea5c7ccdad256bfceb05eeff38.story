Pervert: Dr Michael Lok, pictured, was handed a three-year community order at Bristol Crown Court after admitting filming a boy and several men as they showered in a public changing rooms

A perverted doctor who filmed a boy and several men as they showered in a public changing room narrowly avoided jail today.

Dr Michael Lok was caught with more than 20 images of naked male adults and a child which he took as they used a sports hall.

He was arrested after a 15-year-old boy saw Lok taking pictures of him on his iPhone while he showered.

The sickened teen told staff who informed police and Lok, 50, was quickly identified and admitted taking images of the boy.

He also said he had snapped photos of several other men over the course of a month because he found them attractive.

Lok, of Kingswood, Bristol, admitted one charge of making indecent images of a child and seven further charges of voyeurism.

He
was handed a three-year community order, a 40-day sex offender 
treatment programme, and was made to sign the sex offendersâ€™ register 
for five years.

Lok was also
given a sexual offences prevention order banning him from possessing of
any camera equipment when in a public area where people could be 
changing.

Paul Ricketts, 
prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court: 'A 15-year-old boy went to the 
changing rooms after having had a tennis lesson.

'Whilst
he was getting changed he noticed the defendant sitting there, fully 
clothed. The boy noticed that, while looking into a mirror, he could see
the defendant was holding an iPhone.

'The defendant was taking pictures of the boy in the changing room. There was in effect no partition between that boy and the defendant, who was sat fully clothed.'

Lok prowled changing areas at Bath University Sports Village in Bath for the month before he was caught, taking pictures of men as they showered.

Mr Ricketts added: 'He explained the reason he took the photographs was because he found those people attractive.

'He
said he had been taking photos for around a month and police found 
there was a number of naked photographs of males in that same changing 
room.'

Judge Michael Roach 
told Lok: 'You have let yourself and your profession very badly down by 
what you have done. Spare a thought for the family of the young boy you 
photographed.

'Think how 
upsetting it would be for them to have their son photographed in that 
way as you did on that date in December. It is thoroughly unacceptable.'

Attraction: Lok used his iPhone to film the unsuspecting bathers - including a 15-year-old boy, at Bath University Sports Village, pictured, because he found them attractive, the court heard

'The taking of photographs of other males in those changing rooms is equally reprehensible.

'People should be able to use those changing rooms, safe in the knowledge they are not being photographed by people like you.'

Iain Kelcey, defending, claimed Lok was at a low ebb in his life, owing to the breakdown of a relationship.

Detective Inspector Mike Williams, with the public protection unit, gave a statement outside court.

He said: 'This incident highlights the lengths that Michael Lok went to to gratify his own needs. His victims were unaware they had been filmed and violated in this way.'

The disgraced medic has been suspended from his role as an accident and emergency doctor.
