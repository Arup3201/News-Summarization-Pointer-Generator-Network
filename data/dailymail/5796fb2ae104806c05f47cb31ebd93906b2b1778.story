Touring the Scottish Highlands in winter in a motorhome might not have the same cachet as a swanky Alpine holiday, but we had an absolute blast.

Yes, I hit my head on the low-set cupboards at least three times a day, and yes, it was all rather hugger-mugger for a family of four.

But in the evening, with the gas fire on, and the rain thrumming on the roof, and my sons Dexter and Geordie snuffling in their den above the driver's seat, our cosy motorhome had a rare charm.

There's just about this much room to move: Bill with son Dexter en route to the ski resorts of Aviemore

Even if it was tricky to drive - at nearly 23ft, you really do need the rear-view camera and somebody on pointing duty while you reverse. There was no room for suitcases, so we decanted all our clobber into cupboards. Though the Swift 696 technically sleeps six, it's a tight fit - particularly when you're lugging ski gear.

We were hitting the slopes of Aviemore and staying at High Range, one of the resort's many campsites. Hiring skis was the usual caper and pricey — starting at around £80 for a day's ski-hire, plus £90 for ski-passes for a family of four.

The slopes were like Alton Towers on snow.

Forty-five minutes to get up to the top car-park; hour-long queues for the funicular railway to the top of the mountain, and queue after dispiriting queue for the button-lifts and T-bars.

The skiing was good but limited - two days was more than enough. But when the sun came out, the Cairngorms were every bit as breathtaking as the Alps.

And on the second day, our motorhome came into its own. As my family snoozed, I drove us to the top car-park by 8.30am.

We now had a decent base for lunch, cooked in our little oven and washed down with a glass of chilled Sancerre from the fridge, plus time for a nap afterwards.

An upside-down sort of situation: Dexter and Geordie manage to fit themselves into the motorhome

The sight of me climbing into my tight top bunk was - apparently - the funniest thing of the holiday.

Life in a motorhome is like being on a tight-knit submarine. But it also engenders a wonderful camaraderie as well as a lot of laughs — and that, really, is what family holidays are all about.
