He famously told the nation there was no hurricane in the offing and we could sleep soundly in our beds - just hours before the Great Storm of 1987.

But now, as a fierce storm heads across the Atlantic, Michael Fish has warned there will be 'some really nasty weather' over the weekend.

The 70-year-old veteran weatherman today said that charts show the pressure at the centre 
of Hurricane Bertha has dropped to 974 millibars.

This is close to the 967mb measured 
during last year’s devastating St Jude's Day Storm, which saw gusts of 
99mph tear down trees and spark flash floods.

Risk: Forecasters say there is a 60 per cent chance the tail-end of the storm will batter the southern coast of England on Sunday morning. Above, more storm clouds

'There is some really nasty weather possibly over the weekend,' said the former BBC broadcaster, who was employed by the Met Office

'If
 the models are right we are in for a really lively weekend, almost 
autumnal weather and the message would be to batten down the hatches.

'The remnants of Hurricane Bertha [are] continuing to run east and will start to deepen again. It is going to head off straight across the middle of the country with unseasonably strong winds and heavy rain.'

Hurricane Bertha formed in the warm waters of the Caribbean last weekend, lashing the 
Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with 
winds of up to 90mph.

It then travelled north, veering safely away from the US and Canadian 
coast before heading across the Atlantic. It has now been downgraded to 
an ‘Atlantic storm’, losing power as it travels. 

Looming menace: Hurricane Bertha is losing power but could still bring heavy rain and strong winds to the UK

Forecasters
 say there is a 60 per cent chance the tail-end of the storm will batter the southern coast of 
England on Sunday morning, before it sweeps up towards the North-East.

If
 it does come our way it could result in flash flooding as three weeks’ 
worth of rain falls in just a few hours. Winds of up to 60mph are also 
expected, with huge waves battering the coast.

Michael Fish (right) was one of a roster of weathermen who although they worked for the Met Office became BBC celebrities.

Others included Bill Giles, John Kettley, Suzanne Charlton (Sir Bobby's daughter), Ian McCaskill, Bert Foord and Jack Scott.

Of them all, Mr Fish achieved a notoriety on 15 October 1987 when he said on air :'Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way... well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't!'.

That evening, the worst storm to hit South East England for three centuries caused record damage and killed 19 people.

There
 is a smaller chance – around 10 per cent – that the storm could track further 
north, striking Wales, then Manchester and Cumbria. There is a 30 per 
cent chance it will go further south, missing England and blowing over 
France instead.

The Met Office has taken no chances and issued a severe 'yellow' weather 
warning for most of England and Wales, urging people to keep an eye on 
‘volatile’ conditions.

And today, many parts of the country were affected by flash flooding, resulting in several streets being left underwater and residents evacuated from their homes in the Lincolnshire town of Louth, while downpours also led to waterlogged roads in Maidstone, Kent.

Today’s weather, which is unconnected to Hurricane Bertha, has prompted the Environment Agency to place a flood alert along Louth Canal and Waithe Beck, while there is also a flood warning for
properties near the Louth Canal from Keddington to High Bridge.

A spokesman for the Met 
Office said the transition of Bertha from a tropical to an 
extra-tropical storm was a 'particularly hard one to forecast', but it was
 increasingly expected to affect the UK on Sunday.

Chief Meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, added: 'There is still some uncertainty surrounding this weekend's weather, with the potential for heavy rainfall, strong coastal winds and large waves on Sunday.

'However, there is still a chance that the system may pass to the south of the country giving the UK a brighter day.

'Rain and strong winds may well bring disruption, especially across southern parts of the UK, with the potential for more than 50 mm of rain and coastal gusts of over 60 mph. People should stay up to date with the latest Met Office warnings.'

Enjoying
 it while it lasts: People relaxing during lunch on Brighton beach 
yesterday. Temperatures reached around the 20C in Brighton and the South
 
Coast. However, the situation looks very different on Sunday because the
 remnants of Hurricane Bertha could make landfall

the northwest. Pictured, sunbathers on Brighton beach

Mr Fish also warned: 'Gales
 will pick up around most of the coasts [in England] and on Monday there will be 
gales or severe gales, frequent showers some of them heavy.'

Lincolnshire
 Police said that areas affected by heavy downpours in Louth today included Church Street, 
Eastfield Road, Keddington Road and Horncastle Road, while the Co-op 
store was also temporarily evacuated.

Environment
 Agency flood risk manager, Craig Woolhouse, said: 'Heavy rain on Sunday
 may lead to localised surface water flooding in some parts of England 
and Wales.

'On
 Sunday and Monday a combination of high spring tides and strong 
westerly winds bring a risk of large waves and spray and possible 
flooding to the South West coast of England and along the Severn 
Estuary.

'If you’re travelling to or from holiday then check your flood risk before setting off and don’t drive through flood waters.'

Idyll:
 Crowds gather on Fistral Beach on the second day of the Boardmasters 
surf and music festival in Newquay in Cornwall, yesterday

Surfing
 UK: Rachel Bonhote-Mead competes in a heat of Sun God Woman's Event on 
Fistral Beach  Since 1981, Newquay has been playing host to the 
Boardmasters surfing competition - which is part of a larger five-day 
surf, skate and music festival and has become a integral part of the  
British surf scene

Although
 today is likely to have been a wash-out for many, 
forecasters said tomorrow is expected to be a more pleasant day, with
 cloud and patchy sunshine, yet also a risk of summer 
showers.

Temperatures in the South are expected to reach up to 24C (75F), while they will be in the high teens further north.

Environment
 Minister George Eustice said: 'We are working closely with the Flood 
Forecasting Centre, the Environment Agency, Local Authorities and 
emergency services to ensure we are prepared for any potential flooding 
this weekend.

'I urge people to remain vigilant and pay close attention to advice from the Environment Agency and emergency services.' 

The
 Great Storm of 1987 was the worst to hit South East England for three 
centuries, causing record damage and claiming the lives of 19 people.

Just hours before the storm broke on October 15, Mr Fish said during a BBC forecast: 'Earlier on today, apparently, a woman 
rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way... 
well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't!'

His unfortunate predictions propelled him to international fame.
