Parents of a four-month-old boy have been charged with neglect and child endangerment after the baby was brought to hospital suffering from multiple traumatic injuries.

The child had 14 fractured ribs and a dislocated hip along with a fractured wrist and femur, authorities said. 

Clayton John Fischer, 24, and 21-year-old Hollie May Fischer from Knoxville, Iowa were charged on Monday with neglect of a dependent person and four counts of child endangerment causing serious bodily injury.

The baby was brought to hospital on July 17. Police were called by the department of human services as the baby's injuries did not match with the version of events that the parents offered.

The couple turned themselves into police on Monday, according to the desmoinesregister.com, after an arrest warrant was issued.  

Their son is no longer in the couple's care and the investigation is ongoing. The Fischers were married in April 2012 and had their first child in March this year.

Clayton posted this message on Facebook on his first wedding anniversary: 'Well a year ago in about three hours I married my best friend, my heart, my life and wonderful mother to my crabby child.

'They say the first year is the hardest but it has brought me more joy and happiness than I ever expected. I look forward to many more years to come. I love ya babe.'

Clayton Fischer was previously arrested in January 2013 for public intoxication.

The couple got married in April 2012 and had a baby boy in March this year
