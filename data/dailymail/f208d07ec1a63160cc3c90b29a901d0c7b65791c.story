Justin Bieber can be seen urinating into a cup in a video just released by the Miami Beach Police Department.

The footage was made public after Judge William Altfield ruled earlier this week that the images were a part of public record as it depicts the star undergoing a drug test following his arrest for a DUI on January 23.

In the clip Bieber can be seen undergoing the drug test as he stands at a urinal while a police officer is nearby observing him urinate into a sanitary container.

New footage: Just released police video shows Justin Bieber undergoing urine drug test after his DUI arrest in Miami

The freshly turned 20-year-old stands at the receptacle for nearly a minute before he places the container atop the urinal as he appears to affix a lid onto it.

Bieber then appears to ask the officer a question as he leans over the small partition that is low enough to allow both the camera and the officer to observe the drug test, to ensure there is no foul play.

Earlier in the video the black box - which Miami Police edited in - appears before Bieber positions himself in front of the urinal.

Controversial: Censored footage blacks out sensitive portions of the video

Watchful gaze: The Baby singer can be seen attempting to seal his container following the sample delivery

Heading out: After completing the task the star was escorted out of the restroom

The early appearance of the black bar seems to confirm claims made by TMZ that officers had complained of 
encountering some difficulties in censoring the footage.

The
 release of the footage comes after Judge William Altfield said two of 
the five unreleased video clips depict the singer's genitalia during a 
urine test for drugs at the Miami Beach Police Department.

Altfield
 agreed with lawyers for Bieber, who turned 20 on Saturday, that the 
video's airing would be an invasion of privacy that outweighed the 
public's right to know.

'Mr. Bieber's right to privacy is 
paramount,' the judge said. 'He has not lost his right to privacy, and 
that is what is important here.'

Attorneys
 for The Associated Press and other news outlets had previously 
suggested any sensitive portions be blacked out and the rest released 
under Florida's liberal open records laws.

Official record: The pop star was made to show his tattoos to police following his arrest in January

Much of the footage was released last week, some of it showing Bieber walking unsteadily during a sobriety test.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license.

He
 and R&B singer Khalil Amir Sharieff were arrested early on January 
23 during what police called an illegal street drag race between a 
Lamborghini and a Ferrari.

Neither has been charged with drag racing.

Bieber attorney Roy Black said he was satisfied with the ruling, as did media attorneys.

AP
 attorney Deanna Shullman said the news organization would never show 
Bieber's private parts and Scott Ponce, representing The Miami Herald 
and CBS television stations, said the ruling was more about protecting 
the singer from random releases on the Internet.

'It's more about what someone in the private sector might do,' Ponce said.

Black
 said the three clips to be released without redaction are shot from an 
angle that is too far away to discern what is going on.

Prosecutors said they will release all five remaining clips in a few days, after the court-ordered redactions are completed.

Additionally, a video showing the Baby singer led by a guard while in jail to undergo his urine drug test has also been released.

Separately,
 the Miami Beach Police Department made public a new batch of 18 still 
photos taken shortly after Bieber's arrest, mainly close-ups of his many
 tattoos - a praying Jesus, a grinning joker's face accompanied by the 
word 'love,' an Indian chief's head, a Psalms quotation, and more - and 
one full-length picture of the singer.

Right to privacy: The Miami judge did rule to blackout the star's genitals for the public version of the video

Evidence released previously showed that a breath test found Bieber's blood-alcohol level below the .02 threshold considered intoxicated for underage drivers.

The urine test found the presence of the active ingredient in marijuana and the antianxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told officers he had been smoking marijuana before his arrest, according to police reports.

A trial date has not been set. Altfield set another status conference for next week in the case.

Bieber is also entangled in another legal battle as he is being sued for battery by Miami photographer Jeffrey Binion.

The snapper claims one of Bieber's bodyguards 'choked him and stole his camera equipement' according to TMZ.

Binion's
 suit claims that the singer masterminded the attack last June outside of a recording studio in Miami.

The
 pop star has already been deposed in the case and the hearing promises 
to be quite extensive as it will also question Bieber about his most 
recent encounter in Atlanta 
with another photographer whose camera was allegedly stolen by an 
entourage member.
