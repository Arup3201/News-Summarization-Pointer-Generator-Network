A woman who survived a near-fatal car accident only to suffer a devastating bacterial infection in her colon has been cured after undergoing an unusual treatment known as a 'fecal matter transplant.'

Kaitlin Hunter's life threatening infection was cured after fecal matter from her mother, including healthy bacteria, was transplanted into her colon.

Hunter, 20, of Marietta, Georgia, was involved in a car accident in June 2011 in which her lower spine was fractured, her liver and colon lacerated, and all 10 toes were broken.

Road to recovery: Kaitlin Hunter's life threatening infection was cured after fecal matter from her mother was transplanted into her colon

After a month in hospital in Sacramento, California, Hunter was flown home to Georgia. When she arrived home, she complained of extremely bad stomach pains, which was diagnosed as C. diff, also known as bacteria clostridium difficile.

The C. diff had infected Hunter's colon, causing severe stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. She was prescribed antibiotics to cure the infection.

After nine rounds of antibiotics, Hunter's  weight plummeted to 85 pounds, she was still ill and had lost 40 pounds.

It was then that doctors decided to take a different approach, known as a 'fecal matter transplants' which recolonizes the colon with new bacteria from a healthy donor.

Hunter's mother 'donated' one of her stools for the procedure.

Next, the hospital lab carefully diluted it, and the doctor pumped the foreign fecal matter into Hunter's colon.

The procedure took place in July and Hunter is happy to report that she has been cured. 'I've been so happy,' said told CNN.

C. diff infections kill about 14,000 people in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the number and severity of total cases have increased dramatically over the past decade.
