One small drill for NASA's Mars Curiosity rover is one giant leap for mankind's understanding of Mars'  formation from a climate 'potentially hosting life' to the cold, dry landscape it is today.

 On Wednesday September 24 the robotic Mars Curiosity rover drilled 2.6 inches into an area of the base of Mount Sharp, a structure that reaches 3.4 miles towards the sky.

The rover collected rock samples that it will later analyse with the rover's on-board instruments, reports Yahoo News.

Data and images received on Thursday at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California confirmed success of the rock collection mission, NASA said in a statement released on Thursday.

WHAT IS MARS? 

Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and the next planet beyond Earth. It is, on average, more than 142 million miles from the sun. Mars is about one-sixth the size of Earth. Mars is known as the Red Planet. It gets its red color from the iron in its soil. 

Mars is named for the ancient Roman god of war. The Greeks called the planet Ares. The Romans and Greeks associated the planet with war because its color resembles the color of blood.

Mars has two small moons named  Phobos and Deimos. They are named for the sons of Ares, the Greek god of war. Phobos means 'fear,' and Deimos means 'panic.'

Temperatures on Mars go way below freezing! The average temperature on Mars is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its surface is rocky, with canyons, volcanoes and craters all over it. Red dust covers most of its surface. Mars has clouds and wind, just as Earth does.

 

WHAT IS THE MARS CURIOSITY ROVER?

Curiosity is a car-sized, six-wheeled robot destined for Gale Crater on Mars.

Its mission: to see if Mars ever could have supported small life forms called microbes...and if humans could survive there someday!

In addition to super-human senses that help us understand Mars as a habitat for life, Curiosity's parts are similar to what a human would need to explore Mars (body, brains, eyes, arm, legs, etc.).

Scientists hope that the rock samples will give them a better understanding of how Mars' Mount Sharp formed and what sorts of environmental events led to its growth.

'This drilling target is at the lowest part of the base layer of the mountain, and from here we plan to examine the higher, younger layers exposed in the nearby hills,' said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL.

'This first look at rocks we believe to underlie Mount Sharp is exciting because it will begin to form a picture of the environment at the time the mountain formed, and what led to its growth,' he added.

Scientists are specifically interested in Mount Sharp and are studying the rocks for clues about how Mars shifted from a possibly warm and wet world to a cold, dry, and barren landscape.

The Curiosity rover landed on Mars in August 2012 and first studied an area near the landing site in the Yellowknife Bay area of Mars. The rover drilled holes in an ancient lakebed that may have hosted microbial life over three billion years ago.

Curiosity began its 5 mile journey to Mount Sharp in July 2013 and reached an outcrop at the mountain's base called Pahrump Hills one week ago.

This was the moment scientists had been waiting for after 15 months and hundreds of millions of miles of travel.

'We're putting on the brakes to study this amazing mountain,' said Curiosity deputy project manager Jennifer Trosper of JPL.

'Curiosity flew hundreds of millions of miles to do this,' he added.

On Monday September 22 the rover test drilled an area at the base of the mountain to gage sample collection. The trial went well so that’s why the team decided to go on a drilling mission on Wednesday.

A mission team will deliver a powdered rock sample to Curiosity's open scoop were they will be able to determine if it's safe to send the rover's internal instruments called SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) and CheMin (Chemistry and Mineralogy).
