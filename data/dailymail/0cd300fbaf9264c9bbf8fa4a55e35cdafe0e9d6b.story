Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has applied to enter the supermarket trade by asking to trademark easyFoodstore.com

The billionaire founder of easyJet is to launch a budget supermarket to take on the likes of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, 46, has applied to trademark easyFoodstore.com with the Intellectual Property Office.

The web address leads to a bright orange 'Coming soon' page with only a box to enter an email address to receive email updates and a picture of the Cypriot-born tycoon, reports the Times.

The application shows plans to sell a full range of products, including alcohol, fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and poultry, tinned goods, household items and toiletries.

It also lists the intention to run a trademarked loyalty and incentive scheme among its activities.

This could potentially see easyFoodstore launch its own loyalty card to rival Tesco's Clubcard and Sainsbury's Nectar scheme, which would mark it out from the likes of Asda, Aldi and Lidl, which do not offer loyalty schemes.

There is no mention of a delivery service.

The prospect of another discount supermarket comes at a time when 500,000 people in the UK have been forced to turn to food banks for help feeding their families.

A spokesman for Sir Stelios's easyGroup, the parent company for his brands, declined to offer any more information about where the stores would be or when they would open when contacted by MailOnline.

The entrepreneur, who founded easyJet 18 years ago, is said to be at his richest yet.

Forbes puts his wealth at $1billion, while easyJet shares have reached record highs.

He is the son of a shipping magnate who gave him his first millions to start his own company, before he turned his attention to his budget empire.

A former associate of Sir Stelios 
told the Times: 'For him it has never been about money. His father 
bought him a yacht when he was 18. He could have spent his entire life 
in Monaco being a playboy. His driving force is to prove himself 
successful as a businessman outside the family business of shipping.'

The website for easyFoodstore.com bears a picture of Sir Stelios but little information about where the stores will be

The UK grocery market was worth £163.2billion last year and is predicted to reach £192.6billion by 2017.

Britons spend 54.3p in every £1 at a supermarket, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution.

Other brands under the easyGroup umbrella include car hire, hotels and a small chain of gyms.

Sir Stelios and his siblings own a 37 per cent stake in the budget airline, worth just under £2billion, and have begun selling shares to take advantage of the company's sky-high share price.

He was knighted in 2006 for services to entrepreneurship.
