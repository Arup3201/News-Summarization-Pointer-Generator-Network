The replies range from one university educated woman who felt she had 'nothing to lose' by sending an email to an unemployed grandmother who is 'not of money' and who has 'never been swept off my feet.'

Since his $4,000 billboard became international news, real estate mogul Marc Paskin, 63, has received over 15,000 replies to his lonely heart plea that 'All I want for Christmas is a Latina Girlfriend'

And while Mr. Pakin's wealth and fame from a good-natured stint on ABC's 'Secret Millionaire' have no doubt helped boost the number of women hoping to become Mrs. Paskin, the San Diego resident has said he is touched nonetheless.

Pleased? Marc Paskin - the millionaire property mogul who paid for a lonely heart billboard to be erected in San Diego has received over 15,000 replies

'A week ago Monday I put up a billboard, with the intent to meet someone special, my soul mate,' said Mr. Paskin.

'Last Thursday, the story of my billboard went world wide, on the internet, TV, and newspapers.

'My only desire was to meet someone here in San Diego, but in the past 4 days I have received over 15,000 e-mails from women that want to meet me-from all over the US, and all over the world.'

The flashy $4,000 billboard in Barrio Logan did stir up some controversy though and within a week, the advertisement which featured a photo of Mr. Paskin, as well as an email address was ripped down.

'Vandals took down the board, and I decided not to put it back up. I don't need any more e mails,' said Mr. Paskin.

'Everyone has a right to find love and happiness-I just went about it in a different way. It is a success beyond my wildest dreams.'

'I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and Feliz Navidad.'

While some resident's found the billboard to be lighthearted and comical, other's deemed it slightly offensive.

A day after it went up, somebody already had vandalized the billboard -- located off Interstate 5 and 28th Street -- by peeling off Paskin's email address.

By the weekend, the message was entirely gone. All that was left of the billboard is a blank white space with a few holes.

'It's almost like the mail-order bride thing but stranger,' said San Diegan Yvette Jackson to ABC 10 News.

'If I didn't think I would get in trouble for something like that, I probably would have kind of vandalized it a little myself.

'It just was insulting. It was really insulting.'

Dan Alioa, who works at Union Electric -- which sits directly beneath the sign -- said he chuckled and shook his head when he first saw it.

'I don't agree with that kind of advertising, but if he's got a good heart, lucky him,' said Alioa.

Generosity: Mr Paskin has donated a large amount of his time and fortune to helping the less fortunate

Gold diggers need not apply to Mr Paskin's billboard, as he has donated a large amount of his time and fortune to helping the less fortunate.

Last year, he was featured in an episode of the ABC reality series Secret Millionaire.

The cameras followed Paskin as he 
lived in Detroit on $10 a day for an entire week and worked as a homeless 
shelter volunteer - without anyone’s knowledge of who he really was.

U-T San Diego reported that by the end of the week, he donated about $125,000 to the individuals whom he interacted with at the shelter.

And his charitable ways did not stop on Secret Millionaire, as he went on to cut a check for a 'free apartment for one year' to a woman whose daughter and mother were killed by her estranged husband.

He has also donated more than $1.3million to the Shiley Eye Center and Jacobs Retina Center - a facility dedicated to helping people regain lost eyesight.

In a 2011 interview with U-T San Diego, Mr Paskin said that he has received 'endless' requests for monetary help from people all over the country since he appeared on Secret Millionaire.

In the same interview, he revealed that his hobbies include spending time with his grandkids, and singing karaoke while dressed as Elvis.
