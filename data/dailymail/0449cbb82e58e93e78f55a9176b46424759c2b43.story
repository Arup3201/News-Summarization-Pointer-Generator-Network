To the locals who regularly enjoy a pint at the Old Boot Inn in Stanford Dingley, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are a familiar sight.

A few miles from the £7 million Middleton family home in Bucklebury, the couple love the pub so much they even invited landlord John Haley to their wedding in 2011.

But now their quiet country evenings could be under threat after news emerged that Mr Haley has applied for permission to turn the quaint village pub into a house.

Horrified locals have now mounted a 'save our pub' campaign - and hope the royal couple will lend it their support.

Stanford Dingley is next door to Bucklebury, where the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has been staying, while she recovers from a bout of severe morning sickness.

Locals say they regularly see the royal couple arrive with their armed protection team for a quiet meal in the pub.

Speaking ahead of the royal wedding in 2011, landlord Mr Haley said 'We’re used to seeing Kate in the pub. 

'The first time she and William came in it was nerve-racking, but you soon realise they’re just a normal couple.'

Under threat: The 300-year-old Old Boot Inn, a favourite haunt of the couple,  is at risk of closing

Despite his royal clientele, Mr Haley now says he wants to convert the 300-year-old Grade Two listed building into a house. 

Residents opposing the idea say it would 'cause irrevocable damage to the unique character of this beautiful village' and they want West Berkshire Council planners to reject it.

Mr Haley says the pub, which is still open, is no longer viable as a business. That claim has been questioned by some villagers, while Stanford Dingley Parish Council has taken the unusual step of calling for an independent review to assess the pub’s viability.

A statement from the council says 'The closure of the Old Boot Inn would undoubtedly affect village life, and would prove a serious loss to many in the local community.

'The financial trading data on the Old Boot has been withheld from the Viability Report, and therefore it is impossible to conclude anything about the pub’s current viability, let alone its future prospects.

Celebration: Locals are huge fans of the couple and regularly see them enjoying a quiet meal in the pub

Better: The Duchess has spent much of her time in Bucklebury while recovering from morning sickness

'The review should involve discussions with members of the local community, and consider what investment might be required to sustain the pub in the future.

'Pending that review, our default position will be to oppose the change of use. We are also aware of what can be a very large differential between the value of the pub as a trading asset and its value as a residential dwelling.'

Villager Paul Lemm said 'I object to this change of use application as I believe that the Boot is still viable as a pub.

'The Boot has been an essential part of this community for 300 years and should not be closed.'

Close: The Duchess is very close to her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, who live in the village

Simple pleasures: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are frequent visitors to the Old Boot Inn

Another resident, Andy MacKenzie, said 'The Old Boot Inn is a valuable village community asset and would be greatly missed.

'The pub is well used and famed for royal patronage. The pub is viable with all other pubs in the general area appearing to be thriving.'

The pub was the second stop on The Kate Middleton Tour run by Hampshire-based coach travel firm Mortons to show people places where the Duchess has visited.

Kensington Palace has been approached by the MailOnline for comment.
