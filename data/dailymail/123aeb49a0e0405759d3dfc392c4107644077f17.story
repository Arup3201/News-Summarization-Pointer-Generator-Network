Facing jail: Robert Stephens, 23, broke an ASBO banning him from drinking petrol

A man who propositioned schoolgirls in the street while high on unleaded petrol is facing jail after breaching an ASBO banning him from drinking the fuel.

Robert Stephens was found drunkenly staggering around a petrol station having bought a gallon of unleaded fuel less than eight hours after being released from prison for a string of offences.

The 23-year-old, who is addicted to drinking and sniffing gasoline, was first handed an ASBO banning him from large swathes of his home city following a bizarre drunken outburst during which he taunted unsuspecting women with sexual jibes.

This involved approaching two schoolgirls and saying to them: 'If you're old enough to smoke you're old enough to suck my d***'.

On the same day he violently threatened his grandfather.

He was also issued with an ASBO banning him from drinking petrol after investigators noted the connection between the habit and his offences.

In court, one official said: 'Stephens is known to drink and sniff petrol and during his spree of offences it was noted by some witnesses that he smelled strongly of petrol.

'His presence within the exclusion area coupled with his intoxication and purchase of petrol represents a significantly high risk of serious offences being committed. 

'It was fortuitous that police were in the area and able to apprehend Stephens before more serious offences were committed.' 

Stephens admitted breaching his anti-social behaviour order when he appeared before a judge at Oxford Crown Court, above, on Friday

A judge heard that he returned to the neighbourhood he was banned from almost immediately after being released from jail in February this year. 

He went straight to a petrol station where he was found completely intoxicated after buying a gallon of petrol.

Stephens admitted breaching his anti-social order when he appeared before a judge at Oxford Crown Court on Friday.

Judge Ian Pringle QC told him that a pre-sentence report would be produced and remanded him in custody to appear for sentencing on April 14.
