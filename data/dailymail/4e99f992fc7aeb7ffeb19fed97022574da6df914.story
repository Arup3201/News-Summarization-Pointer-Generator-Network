A disgusting Chinese takeaway has been shut down after health experts found cockroaches, mice droppings, filthy hobs smeared in grease and food left to cool inches from bags of rubbish. 

The Golden Dragon in Plaistow, east London, was closed on the spot after inspectors discovered the horrific catalogue of flagrant health and safety breaches.

The fast food outlet is thought to have been trading for at least a month before it was officially closed by Stratford Magistrates Court last Friday.

'It's one of the worst cases I've seen in 12 years,' said Matthew Collins, principal environmental health officer for Newham Council.

Mr Collins said the takeaway posed a serious risk of food poisoning and contamination of food amid a total lack of management.

The council team had received a tip-off from a member of the public, who had not eaten at the takeaway, about staff at the Golden Dragon fly-tipping behind a nearby shop.

When environmental health officer Edward King went to inspect the business he had no inkling that it would become the worst case he had ever seen.

After twice finding the shutters down and the building apparently closed, he was finally able to carry out an inspection at the fast food outlet.

'On the third visit, Mr King stood on the other side of the road and watched a man leave the premises with a bag that looked like one used for transporting hot food,' said Mr Collins.

'He knocked on the shutter and went in - as he was entitled to do - and found it in an awful condition.'

Inspectors also discovered a filthy wok hob which was swimming in fat, food and grease at the East End takeaway

Rodent droppings, found of the next to bottles of sauce, posed a serious risk of contamination to food

'There was a risk of food poisoning as well as contamination from the droppings and cockroaches.'

The Golden Dragon was served a notice to stop trading immediately but not before it had taken orders online through popular website Just Eat.

The business previously operated under the name Sancho's but disappeared off the council's radar 'a couple of years ago', said Mr Collins. 'There are about 2,000 food businesses in Newham and they change hands quite regularly,' he added.

'I'd say we shut down one every two weeks on average, which I believe is the highest figure in London.'

Some 31 businesses have been shut in Newham this year as the council cracks down on restaurants and takeaways with shocking hygiene.

The owners of the Golden Dragon must now undertake a deep clean their takeaway from top to bottom, impose proper pest control and set new health and safety standards before they can reopen.

A Newham Council spokeswoman said they were also considering their options regarding a prosecution of the takeaway and would be speaking to the owners in due course. 

The owners of Golden Dragon were unavailable for comment.
