Anyone renting this flat would perhaps not fully agree with it’s description as 'cosy'.

The tiny flat, which includes a double-bed squeezed next to a wardrobe, washing machine, cooker and fridge, is available for £400 per month including bills.

Located in Brantingham Road, in the upmarket suburb of Chorlton, Manchester, the 'all new modern studio apartment' also has a small bathroom with a compact shower, toilet and wash basin.

However, anyone wanting to live in this flat might struggle to do more than lie down or make a cup of tea when they’re at home due to its tiny measurements.

It’s not even clear if it’s possible to open the fridge or cupboard fully because they are so close to the bed - but at least you wouldn’t have to reach far to get your breakfast.

The flat also boasts a small shower, according to the advert on website Gumtree.

When contacted the landlord said he 'wasn’t sure' how big the flat was or whether it was still available.

As would-be tenants are asked to contact Manuel, it led to one Fawlty Towers-inspired inquiry which read: 'Hola Basil, I’m very interested in your flat on the Brantingham Road. Please me with your details thank you very much. Manuel.'

In May this year, pictures emerged of what was thought to be London’s smallest flat up for rent in Earl’s Court.

It was available for only slightly more at £563 a month, with a shower, hob and fridge squeezed into one tiny room alongside a bed.
