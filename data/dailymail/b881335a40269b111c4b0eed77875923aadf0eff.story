Sunderland made it two wins out of two in pre-season as they saw off Carlisle United 1-0 at Brunton Park.

Substitute Michael Mandron scored the only goal of the game after 71 minutes to condemn Carlisle to defeat. 

Mandron cut in from the left and swept the ball past on-rushing goalkeeper Mark Gillespie to give Sunderland the victory.

Carlisle United: Gillespie, Symington, Grainger, Potts, O'Hanlon, Archibald-Henville, Amoo (Dempsey 80), Sweeney, Paynter, Kearns, Brough.

Subs not used: Thirlwell, Meppen-Walter, Gillies, Rigg, Hanford

Goal: Mandron (72)

Attendance: 3,616 (1,123 Sunderland fans)

The 19-year-old Frenchman was one of 11 substitutions made by Black Cats boss Gus Poyet as he aims to rotate his squad ahead of the new season.

Poyet and Carlisle manager Graham Kavanagh embraced before the game as a show of mutual respect between the side.

One concern for Sunderland is that defender Modibo Diakite limped off after only 29 minutes.

The League Two outfit started the stronger and will feel unfortunate to come away on the losing side having controlled large portions of the game.

They even had a goal disallowed just before half time when Antony Sweeney thought he had put the home side ahead but it was ruled out for offside.

Yet the Black Cats' class told as they continued to press for a winner which eventually came through Mandron, delighting the 1,123 travelling Sunderland supporters.
