It is said that most babies look a bit like Winston Churchill - and that maxim certainly applies to Prince George, according to his doting uncle Harry.

The older prince, who is on a tour of South America, told a reporter that his nephew's 'big chubby cheeks' gave him a resemblance to the wartime Prime Minister.

George, who will celebrate his first birthday next month, is perhaps the best-known baby in the world - but he still has some way to go before he can match the stature of Churchill.

Dignified: But George has some way to go if he is to match the achievements of Churchill

Harry, 29, made the light-hearted comments during a reception in Chile's capital Santiago, where he was attending an event to celebrate the official birthday of his grandmother, the Queen.

The reception was hosted by British ambassador Fiona Clouder, and attended by local dignitaries from business, the arts and politics.

Radio presenter Virginia Araya said that she had asked Harry about his nephew during the event.

'I asked him what George was like,' she said. 'He said: "He's growing up, he is walking and he has big, chubby cheeks. He looks like a young Winston Churchill."'

Temper: Like Churchill, George can show flashes of an outspoken temperament

Quip: Prince Harry made his comments during an event at the British embassy in Chile

Harry's comments yesterday came a day after he received a wedding proposal from a woman with the same surname as his sister-in-law, Kate Middleton.

According to the Telegraph, TV reporter Bernardita Middleton confronted the prince on the streets of Santiago while wearing a tiara and said to him: 'I am a Middleton, like Princess Kate. I be your next wife Harry.'

Before arriving in Chile, Harry visited Brazil, where he watched England's final World Cup match against Costa Rica.

He also helped a family living in the slums of Valparaiso to enjoy the football by mending their television just in time for Brazil's second-round clash with Chile.
