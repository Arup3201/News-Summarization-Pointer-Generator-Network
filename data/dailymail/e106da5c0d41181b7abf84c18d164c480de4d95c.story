A footballer has died after a celebration went tragically wrong in India's Mizoram Premier League.

Peter Biaksangzuala died in hospital on Sunday after falling on his head while attempting a somersault after scoring for Bethlehem Vengthlang FC - a club based in the north east Indian province of Mizoram.

The 23-year-old midfielder scored a 62nd-minute equaliser against Chanmari West FC in Tuesday's league encounter and celebrated acrobatically - in a manner similar to record World Cup goalscorer Miroslav Klose.

Biaksangzuala mistimed his landing and his head took the brunt of the fall.

Team-mates immediately rushed to his aid and he was carried off the pitch on a stretcher.

Biaksangzuala was rushed to Aizawl Civil Hospital where a CT scan revealed he had severely damaged his spinal cord and he was moved to an intensive care unit.

It was clear from the reaction of players and the referee that Biaksangzuala was seriously hurt

The Mizoram Premier League is at state level. Each state has their own league and on a national scale, play in the third tier of Indian football.

He spent five days in hospital, as doctors unsuccessfully attempted to heal his injuries, and was pronounced dead in the early hours of Sunday after being put on a ventilator.

A source said: 'He was trying to do Germany's Klose signature flip stunt, but it misfired unfortunately.' 

Reports in India suggest that Biaksangzuala had donated his eyes during the time he spent in the hospital.

In memory of the midfielder, Bethlehem Vengthlang FC have retired his shirt No 21 with the Mizoram Football Association releasing a statement via their official Facebook page.

The statement read: 'Bethlehem Vengthlang FC midfielder Peter Biaksangzuala lost his fight for survival after he suffered a fatal injury while celebrating his goal.

'It has been a sad day for Mizoram football and the demise of the footballer shook his team-mates, footballers and fans alike all over Mizoram.

'Peter was a defensive midfielder who had always been aggressive and hard working, a true team player. Like most defensive midfielders, he was excellent at reading the game, breaking up attacks and protecting his defenders.

'Peter's club Bethlehem Vengthlang FC will retire his jersey no. 21.'

Bethlehem Vengthlang coach Danny Lalduhawma added: 'Peter was a lad with good manner who always maintained his discipline on and off the pitch. I don't think there are many like him.'
