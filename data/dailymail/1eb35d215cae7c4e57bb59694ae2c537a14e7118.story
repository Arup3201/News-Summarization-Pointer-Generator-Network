UKIP leader attended a dinner hosted by Elton John

Nigel Farage has been rebuffed by music star Sir Elton John after hinting that he could publicly back UKIP.

The UKIP leader yesterday revealed he had been invited to a dinner party thrown at the pop star’s home. 

Mr Farage claimed the pair had ‘got on very well indeed’ and had chatted about politics.

Speaking about the dinner, Mr Farage yesterday said: ‘Maybe I’ve got a big announcement to make. You never know.’

But a spokesman for the singer dismissed the suggestion that inviting Mr Farage for dinner meant Sir Elton would be supporting UKIP.

The spokesman told Pink News: ‘Elton will not be favouring any party.’

Mr Farage attended Sir Elton’s house as a guest of Lord Black of Crossharbour, the former media baron who served three years in a US jail for fraud.

The UKIP leader said that he had been invited by Sir Elton and his partner David Furnish to a dinner six or seven weeks ago.

Speaking to the internet radio station Fubar, he said: ‘It was a private dinner but, yeah, we talked about politics and current affairs and these things. I got on very well with Elton John indeed.’

He added: ‘He really truly understands — as a guy that comes from an ordinary background — that the gap between rich and poor is getting wider and wider and that lots of working-class lads are not being given the chance these days to achieve their best.’

Asked if the star understood ‘the European question’, Mr Farage said: ‘Oh, I don’t want to speak for him but I think that . . . he’s no idiot. He knows what’s going on in the world.’

Later in the interview, Mr Farage accepted it was unlikely the singer was about to become a UKIP member. He said: ‘No. This speculation often runs away with itself.

‘But I tell you what — he does host a very good dinner. The food was magnificent and the wine — the wine! — the wine, it was even better.’

Mr Farage hinted that Sir Elton might be considering supporting UKIP. But a spokesman for the singer-songwriter dismissed the suggestion

In 2008 Sir Elton and Mr Furnish each donated £10,000 to the Liberal Democrats to support Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, to become London mayor.

He has also revealed that Gordon Brown is a friend but would not say whether he would vote Labour.
