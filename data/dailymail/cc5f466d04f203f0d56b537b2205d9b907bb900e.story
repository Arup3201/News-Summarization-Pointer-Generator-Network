The last thing you would see  in final terrifying moments before the crocodile's jaw snaps shut are its deadly teeth followed by darkness.

Crocodiles strike fear in a way not many other animals can, infamous for their ferocious ambush tactics, deadly speed and moves including the death roll.

A 50-second video of a five-metre saltwater crocodile named Elvis taken at the Australian Reptile Park north of Sydney is all it takes to prove how vicious the aquatic reptile can be.

Filmed on a GoPro during feeding time, three men can be seen inside the 48-year old crocodile's enclosure, with the camera stategically placed to capture everything.

Help! The angry crocodile's sharp teeth can been seen as it clenches on to a GoPro camera

One man approaches the water area where the crocodile, the longest in NSW, is submerged. After disturbing the animal by using a stick to splash the water in its purpose-built lagoon, the angered animal lunges out head first towards the man.

The same man then dangles a stick with a piece of meat attached to it above the crocodile's head. After two attempts the crocodile gets the piece of meet and easily gulps it down.

But the reptile is not finished there - it then turns its attention to the nearby camera, which it violently attacks, moving with speed and ease as it clenches the camera in its jaws.

The camera remains in the crocodile's mouth for about seven seconds, before the massive animal tosses it across the enclosure, sending it airborne and crashing into water. While inside the reptile's mouth, several sharp teeth and its white tongue can been seen as the camera faces directly into its jaws.

Australian Reptile Park general manager Tim Faulkner was in the enclosure at the time and said while there was always an element of risk when working with crocodiles, the handlers were methodical in their approach.

'If you make a mistake he's (Elvis) going to have you . . . It's always a calculated risk,' he said.

'Crocodiles are not known for being intelligent, but what they lack they make up for in instinct.

'We were filming for archival footage but he (Elvis) must have sensed something different - he was curious.'

Despite the animals attack on the camera, Mr Faulkner said he was not in danger and found the incident comical to watch.

'As big as they are they are still inquisitive,' he said.

But this footage is not the first time Elvis' bad behaviour was caught on camera. The angry crocodile is renown for his aggressive nature, having previously attacked a lawn mower while in use at the reptile park in 2011 (see video below).

He was relocated to the park from Darwin Harbour for being a rouge crocodile with a history of climbing on board fishing boats.

He was them moved to farm but was deemed not suitable after attacking other crocodiles. In 2008 he moved into the park.

The saltwater crocodile is the world's largest reptile and can be found on Australia's northern coast and inland for more than 100 kilometres. They can also be found in south east Asia and eastern coast of India.

Growing to an average length of about four metres, they can exceed this, growing up to seven metres long and with a lifespan of about 70 years.

As the animals grow their prey also gets bigger, with adult male saltwater crocodiles able to demolish prey as big as a one-tonne water buffalo.

However, their diet is mostly made up of small prey including fish, turtles, small mammals and birds.

The crocodiles prefer living in deep and dark murky waters and they favour estuary areas.
