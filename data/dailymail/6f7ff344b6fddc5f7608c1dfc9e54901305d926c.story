David Cameron today insisted emergency legislation is needed to allow Britain’s spies to access data about the public’s phone calls, texts and emails.

The Prime Minister said new laws are needed to reinstate powers to 'help keep us safe from those who would harm UK citizens'.

The laws - drawn up with backing from the Tories, Lib Dems and Labour - will be rushed through Parliament amid mounting concern about the threat posed to the UK by jihadists returning from fighting in Syria.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg today announced plans for emergency spy laws at a press conferencein Number 10

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have struck a deal with Labour to pass laws which will last for two years forcing phone companies to keep records of calls and texts for 12 months

An emergency Cabinet meeting was held early this morning, and Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg held a rare joint press conference in Downing Street.

In the Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs: 'Without this legislation, we face the prospect of losing access to this data overnight with the consequence police investigations will suddenly go dark and criminals will escape justice. We cannot allow that to happen.'

Ministers insist the powers are not new, but will maintain the existing ability for the police and spy agencies to access data held by telecommunications companies.

Rather, it is intended to protect the ‘capability’ which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing. 

The emergency Data Retention and Investigation Powers Bill will be rushed onto the statute book next week, after cross-party talks between Mr Cameron, his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband. 

But critics condemned the 'stitch-up' which will see the laws 'railroaded' through Parliament with little scrutiny.

Speaking alongside Mr Clegg in Downing Street this morning, the Prime Minister said the new laws were needed to catch terrorists and criminals. 

He said: 'Unless we act now companies will no longer retain the data about who contacted who, where and when and we will no longer be able to use this information to bring criminals to justice and keep our country safe.'

Mr Clegg insisted 'liberty and security must go hand in hand' as he gave Lib Dem backing to the plans

Home Secretary Theresa May announced the emergency laws in the Commons today. She said people could not have freedom without security 

What powers do the police and MI5 have? 

In the wake of the July 7 attacks, an EU directive meant telephone and internet companies have been obliged to keep customer records for 12 months.

It covered details of the time, date and recipient of phone calls, texts and emails, but not the content.

It is essentially what you might see on your monthly phone bill: Who you called and when, but not what you said. 

Security agencies argue it has proved crucial in smashing a series of terrorist plots, as well as organised crime syndicates and paedophile groups. 

So what has changed? 

The directive was ruled unlawful by the European Court of Justice in April this year.

Its implementation by the Labour government in 2009 was said to be invalid because it interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental right to respect for private life.

As a result, ministers given a strict deadline to re-write UK law or stop using the spy powers.

What will new the laws mean?

Ministers insist it replicates what was in place before April. It does not cover the content of calls or emails, which requires a warrant signed off by the Home Secretary. 

Isn't this the snoopers' charter?

The government insists not. The powers involved have been in place since 2006.

The so-called snoopers' charter, proposed by the Tories two years ago, was an extension of those powers.

It would have covered details of every website which was clicked on, as well as direct messages on Facebook and Twitter and information exchanged between players in online video games.

Mr Cameron added: It is used in 95 per cent or all serious organised crime cases handled by the CPS.

'It's been used in every major security service counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade. It is the foundation for prosecutions of paedophiles, drug dealers and fraudsters.'

The Prime Minister said some companies were already refusing to work with the Government over fears they could be sued.

He added: 'We face real and credible threats to our security from serious and organised crime, from the activity of paedophiles, from the collapse of Syria, the growth of Isis in Iraq and al Shabab in East Africa.

'I am simply not prepared to be a prime minister who has to address the people after a terrorist incident and explain that I could have done more to prevent it.'

Earlier, Mr Cameron said: 'It is the first duty of government to protect our national security and to act quickly when that security is compromised. 

'As events in Iraq and Syria demonstrate, now is not the time to be scaling back on our ability to keep our people safe. 

'The ability to access information about communications and intercept the communications of dangerous individuals is essential to fight the threat from criminals and terrorists targeting the UK.

'No government introduces fast track legislation lightly. But the consequences of not acting are grave.

'I want to be very clear that we are not introducing new powers or capabilities – that is not for this Parliament. 

'This is about restoring two vital measures ensuring that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies maintain the right tools to keep us all safe.' 

The new law will expire in 2016, when the next government will have to revisit the issue. 

After weeks of negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, agreement has now been reached to re-instate the powers. 

This will be done by writing them directly into British law rather than relying on the now unlawful 2006 EU data retention directive.

Tory ministers remain adamant that further powers are needed to reflect changes in technology since 2006 - but accept this will now have to wait until after the 2015 General Election.

The Liberal Democrats remain implacably opposed to the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ – which would have given police and spy agencies even greater powers to monitor every telephone call, email and internet search in Britain.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'We know the consequences of not acting are serious, but this urgency will not be used as an excuse for more powers, or for a ‘snooper’s charter’.

'I believe that successive governments have neglected civil liberties in the pursuit of greater security. We will be the first Government in many decades to increase transparency and oversight, and make significant progress in defence of liberty.

'But Liberty and security must go hand in hand. We can’t enjoy our freedom if we’re unable to keep ourselves safe.' 

Under the plans announced today, a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will be created to balance individual freedom against the need to tackle threats to national security and serious crimes.

Some public bodies including the Royal Mail and the pensions regulator will lose their right to ask phone and web companies for the records.

Others, including councils, will have their access to records limited. Annual transparency reports will be published to show hoe surveillance powers are being used.

Home Secretary Theresa May arrives in Downing Street to brief an emergency Cabinet meeting on the new laws

The emergency laws will be passed by Parliament next week after a deal between Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband

Police and spy agencies argue that being able to see who criminal suspects - or their victims - have called or emailed has played a crucial role in almost every major investigation.

They claim it s particularly important for targeting serious criminals, including drug dealers, paedophiles and fraudsters. 

Downing Street said the killers of Liverpool schoolboy Rhys Jones, a gang of men who groomed young girls in Rochdale and a drugs gang operating in Merseyside, Lancashire, Glasgow and South Wales in 2011 were all caught in part as a result of using mobile phone records.

The government says it has also been used to stop crimes in while they are still in progress and save lives.

But civil liberties groups say it is an extension of the surveillance state which treats everyone as a potential criminal. 

Senior Labour MP Tom Watson condemned the way the laws were being rushed without giving Parliament chance to scrutinise it properly.

‘The government were aware of this European Court of Justice ruling six weeks ago and what we are seeing now is they are railroading through legislation,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘No-one in civic society has got a chance to form a view on this. It’s a stitch-up.

‘It is a secret deal between the three parties and it will go through next week as they have done this deal.’

Jim Killock, head of the Open Rights Group, said: 'The government knows that since the CJEU ruling, there is no legal basis for making internet service providers retain our data so it is using the threat of terrorism as an excuse for getting this law passed. 

'The Government has had since April to address the CJEU ruling but it is only now that organisations such as ORG are threatening legal action that this has become an 'emergency'.'  

The laws are intended to protect the 'capability' which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing

These three men all claim to have come from Britain and feature in an ISIS video featuring young British jihadists encouraging Muslims in the West to join them in Iraq and Syria

In a speech last month, Home Secretary Theresa May said the security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘real and deadly’ threat from jihadists.

She said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from London by plane.

At the same time, the internet has become a ‘paradise’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities.

But Mrs May added that the powers used to defeat Britain’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology, leading to a collapse in Britain’s capacity to protect its citizens.  

Later this year, a report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee into the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, southeast London, is expected to argue that - had MI5 had greater internet surveillance powers - it could have helped to thwart the plot.
