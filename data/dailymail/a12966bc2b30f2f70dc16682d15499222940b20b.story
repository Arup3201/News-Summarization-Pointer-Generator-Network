A wealthy crime tsar with two houses has been given a taxpayer-funded allowance so he can stay the night nearer his office. 

Tony Hogg, the £85,000-a-year Tory Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, is receiving £650 a month in public funds for accommodation to make his drive to work shorter.

A former warship captain, he has chosen to bed down at a Navy camp where staying Monday to Friday would cost only £340 a month – but his office insists he is not profiting from the arrangement.

The allowance has outraged rank-and-file police, who say he could stay free in an en suite room at the force HQ. Critics said last night that his spending was unjustifiable when the force has had to save £40 million over the past two years.

Nigel Rabbitts, chairman of Devon and Cornwall Police Federation, said: ‘In times of austerity this is not an appropriate expenditure. Mr Hogg knew he would need to spend a lot of time in Exeter when he took the job.’

He added: ‘There is police accommodation at the constabulary’s HQ in Exeter. I have to use that when I need to stay overnight and so do other officers. It’s good, en suite accommodation but perhaps the PCC feels it’s not good enough for him.’

Mr Hogg, 64, and his wife Chrissie live in a house in a ‘stunning location’ in Helston, West Cornwall, which cost £355,000 in 2000. They planned to open a B&B but say they have had no customers.

They also bought a cottage nearby for £185,000, which they rent out.

A veteran of the Falklands War, Mr Hogg 
was elected to his post last November. Since then, the new PCC – who is 
meant to make police more accountable to the public – has come under 
fire for spending almost £250,000 on consultants and agency staff.

The head of a sleaze watchdog that 
has warned of cronyism and conflicts of interest among PCCs is to 
lecture all the crime tsars after a series of scandals.

David Prince, 
head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, will tell the 41 
commissioners gathering in London next month that they must display 
integrity and openness.

Allegations have emerged of PCCs giving well-paid jobs to friends and allies without advertising the posts.

Mr Rabbitts added: ‘We have seen a steady increase in his office’s expenditure and his staffing levels, at a time when the rest of us are losing staff and funding.’

Mr Hogg’s office agreed last week that he could receive £7,800 a year before tax towards the cost of staying overnight near the PCC office in Exeter. A meeting was told that it was ‘unreasonable and impractical’ for him to make the 200-mile round trip from his home in Helston to the office and back.

A spokesman said last night that, after tax, Mr Hogg is left with just enough cash to stay at the Navy’s camp in Lympstone, just outside Exeter, where rooms cost £17 a night.

Mr Hogg, who was unavailable for comment last night, is said to have decided it would be inappropriate to stay in the free en suite rooms at the Exeter Police HQ.

But Councillor Brian Greenslade, former Liberal Democrat chairman of Devon County Council and runner-up to Mr Hogg in the PCC elections, said: ‘It is simply not acceptable. Why can’t he use police accommodation like I and others sometimes had to when we worked for the former police authority?’

And Councillor Alex Folkes, a member of the local Police and Crime Panel, said: ‘It seems Tony Hogg’s first instinct is to put his hand in the taxpayer’s pocket. He seems to forget he is already getting £85,000 a year of our money.’
