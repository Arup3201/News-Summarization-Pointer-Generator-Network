What a derby! Three great penalty claims, one red card, perhaps two others missed and a superb winning goal.

So many questions were asked of referee Michael Oliver that his head will be buzzing well into the week as he analyses what he got right and what he should work on. 

The penalties

1. Marouane Fellaini on Sergio Aguero (42mins) - A clear penalty as the Belgian kicked the Manchester City forward on the Achilles from behind. For  Felliaini to then turn and have a go at  Aguero was disgraceful.

There were some suggestions on Twitter that Fellaini spat at Aguero as he lay on the turf. However, it looked like saliva falling from his mouth as he shouted at the striker.

2. Marcos Rojo on Yaya Toure (45mins) - Right on half-time a fascinating challenge as Toure was played clean through, but Rojo made a last-ditch lunge and appeared to kick the ball away from between Toure’s legs.

From Oliver’s central position, while Rojo’s follow-through certainly caught Toure, it was almost impossible to determine if he caught the Ivorian before he played the ball. As doubt existed, Oliver was right not to give the penalty. Had it been a foul, it would have been a red card as well.

Toure was sure it was a penalty, which surely would have resulted in a second sending off for United

3. Michael Carrick on Aguero (61mins) - Makeshift centre-half Carrick was drawn into tripping Aguero as the brilliant Argentine weaved across the penalty area.

Ten years ago, almost to the day (November 7) I reffed a Manchester derby at Old Trafford and denied a host of penalty claims for the home side.

Sir Alex Ferguson waited in the tunnel and after berating me claimed that ‘to get a penalty my player would have had to be felled with an axe!’ I guess Manuel Pelligrini must feel the same.

The red cards (that were... and weren't)

1. Chris Smalling (39mins) - The one red card that was issued is beyond dispute: Smalling’s first yellow card was a routine one, but not mandatory, when he raised his leg to stop Joe Hart kicking the ball from hand.

The second yellow was for a poorly timed tackle on James Milner which was as clear a caution as you could see. No choice for the referee but to send him off.

2. Joe Hart (31mins) - The City keeper could have been red carded when, for some inexplicable reason, he raced out of his goal to challenge Oliver over a decision. Hart appeared to overrun and get too close to the referee. His head appeared to go down and into Oliver’s face (below) which left the referee the option to dismiss.

3. Marcos Rojo - If the Yaya Toure incident was a foul, then a red card would have had to follow for the United defender.

Perhaps it was this fact which swayed Oliver into ignoring the penalty claims and blowing for half-time instead.

The lessons

1. Be brave - Give penalties even in the furnace that is a Manchester derby.

In the case of Fellaini and Aguero, if you don’t give the penalty, you need to deal with the aftermath.

Fellaini could have been booked for raging in Aguero’s face, but Oliver just ran away from the scene. You have to deal with behaviour like that or it can escalate.

2. Get wide – You see contact better from side on and too many referees are lazy and stay central due to the pace of the modern game.

3. Use advantage wisely - Yes, it’s good to let the game flow but there is a balance. Those who are fouled can feel aggrieved and seek retribution.

We saw this happen on a number of occasions after Wayne Rooney and Toure had been fouled. 

Referee Oliver rode his luck as the penalty decisions didn’t affect City winning the game

At the final whistle Oliver appeared to breathe a sigh of relief and smiled. He knows that he rode his luck as the penalty decisions didn’t affect City winning the game.

He is a promising referee who is being pushed ahead of the controversial Mark Clattenburg, but he is by no means the finished article yet.
