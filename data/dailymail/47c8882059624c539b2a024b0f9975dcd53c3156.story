Prison visit: Sheila Lee was on her way to see paedophile Anthony Barry Lee in jail when she veering into the path of another car

The pensioner who caused the head-on collision which killed a father and son and left his wife and daughter fighting for their lives, was on her way to visit her paedophile husband in prison.

Sheila Lee, 70, was heading to Doncaster jail when her car veered into the path of the VW Golf being driven by Derek Sarkar, 47, according to police.

He and front seat passenger Ethan, 14, were killed instantly. Mrs Lee also died from her injuries following the impact on Saturday afternoon.

It has now emerged she was on her way to visit Anthony Barry Lee, 67, who police described as a ‘monster’ for sex crimes against two generations of the same family, spread over 21 years.

He was jailed for seven years for indecently assaulting the older victim repeatedly when she was aged ten to 17, and then, more than a decade later, assaulting that woman’s daughter three times, when she was aged between five and ten.

York Crown Court heard he committed the offences when other people were present.

Detective Inspector Shaun Page, of York and Selby Protecting Vulnerable Persons Unit, said after the trial in December, last year: ‘Anthony Barry Lee is a monster who preyed on his victims over a substantial period of time.

'Prison is the best place for him and will hopefully help him to realise the magnitude of his vile and heartless crimes.'

Lee, of, Wigginton, Yorkshire, was put on the sex offenders’ register for life and made subject to a sexual offences prevention order for an indefinite period.

Mrs Lee’s daughter had also been travelling to the prison in a separate car some distance behind and came across the scene.

Horror: The car driven by Sheila Lee veered across the carriageway, ploughing into the VW Golf driven by Derek Sarkar, right, killing him and son Ethan, left, and seriously injuring daughter Abbie and wife Karen

The devastating accident provoked a huge
emergency services response with two air ambulances, three land 
ambulances and two rapid response paramedic units joining firefighters 
and police at the remote scene near the village of East Cowick, East 
Yorkshire.

The investigation and clear-up operation took more than seven hours before the road was reopened.

Derek Sarkar and his family, from Sheldon in Birmingham, are believed to have been on an Easter break.

Devastation: Karen Sarkar was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary where she is in a critical condition

A
police spokesman said: ‘It appears the Volvo crossed on to the wrong 
side of the carriageway into the path of the oncoming Golf.’

Mr Sarkar and Ethan were pronounced dead after the crash shortly after 1.30pm on Saturday afternoon.

Mr
Sarkar’s wife, Karen, 43, and their nine-year-old daughter Abbie were 
airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, where they were in a critical 
condition.

Witnesses told how they ran to the scene of the crash and could hear a child screaming.

Debbie Hinchliffe, who lives a short distance from the bridge over the Aire and Calder Navigation canal, said she found Mrs Stavert-Lee unconscious in the Volvo, which had smoke pouring from its front.

She said: ‘I was standing at my  gate and I heard the crash. I ran to  the scene.

‘The old lady was unconscious and people were screaming in the back of the other car. I couldn’t get anybody out.

‘The car was going to catch fire with the old lady in.

‘So I got in the car with her to turn the ignition off. I released her seatbelt and just stuck with her. I couldn’t do anything else.’

Mrs Hinchliffe said it was clear that both Mr Sarkar and his son were already dead.

Within minutes other people arrived at the scene, including emergency services, and they were able to free the occupants from the mangled wreckage.

Locals complain the stretch of road is a death trap and the scene of regular accidents

Mrs Hinchliffe said she took the 
pensioner’s shocked daughter to her house. Police arrived a short time 
later to tell her that her mother had died.

Mrs Hinchliffe claimed the stretch of road, which has a 40mph limit, was an accident blackspot.

‘There’s
accidents every other week,’ she added. ‘We want speed cameras. You 
take your life in your hands every time you pull out.

‘How many accidents and deaths is it going to take before they  do something?

‘We have to live with this on a daily basis. It’s horrendous.’

Hugh Dales, a 55-year-old construction worker, said: ‘There are two or three serious accidents here each year.

‘They came out and did tests  and decided the speed limit  was correct.

‘My wife was told that as there had not been any fatalities there was nothing they could do.

Both drivers and a 14-year-old passengers were killed when these two cars collided in Goole, Yorkshire, yesterday

‘It’s shocking that they have had to wait for somebody to die.’

Last night a neighbour of the Sarkars said: ‘They were an absolutely lovely family, just lovely.

‘We all used to pop in and out of each other’s houses all the time, to chat and do things for each other.

‘Derek used to tease me about anything he could and the kids were really nice kids.’

n A father died yesterday while trying to rescue his son after a giant wave swept him out to sea.

The two men were fishing on rocks in Cornwall when the son, aged 27, was engulfed.

His 60-year-old father threw a lifebelt into the water as the younger  man was swept away from Tregardock beach, near Delabole.

But he was knocked into the water by another wave while he was trying to haul his son to safety.

The pair, who are understood to be local, were in the sea for about 30 minutes before being rescued by a lifeboat crew.

The
father was later declared dead, while his son was taken to the Royal 
Cornwall Hospital at Treliske. Last night his condition was unknown.

Two passengers were taken by the helicopters to Leeds General Infirmary. Officers said they had serious 'life-threatening' injuries
