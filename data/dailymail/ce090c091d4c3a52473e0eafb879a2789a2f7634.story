The site of a dead blue whale is proving to be New Zealand's newest attraction this week with tourists flocking to see the 100-tonne beast off the country's North Island.

The animal, known to be the largest and heaviest which has ever existed, was spotted on Tuesday along Taranaki shore, near New Plymouth, just a day after it was seen drifting upside down by a passing ship about 5km out to sea.

Its sheer size and scale was put into perspective by videographer Stefan Nagel who posted a three-minute clip to YouTube featuring he, his father and a host of other excited onlookers examining the amazing creature from up close.Â

Scientists could not determine the exact cause of death for the 100-tonne beast but they believed it died of natural causes

Looking slightly worse for wear, the footage shows the animal with parts of its body cut and dissected from a necropsy - an animal autopsy - which scientists undertook to determine its cause of death.

Taranaki Department of Conservation acting senior biodiversity ranger Callum Lilley said it was too difficult to determine how it died, because its organs had deteriorated so badly.

He did say, however, that it appeared no shark or predator had tried to devour the whale and it died of natural causes.

Mr Nagel told Daily Mail Australia that he drove to Taranaki Shore before walking some 2km along the remote coastline to where the whale was resting. He said it was like 'stepping back in time into another era' when he and his father eventually spotted it.

'I felt humbled and in awe at the same time, being up close and personal to something that big,' he said.

'There were lots of rocks as well as algae surrounding the dead Blue Whale and I had to do a lot of careful climbing to capture all angles of the whale.'

'Eventually my father worked up the courage to climb on top and I soon followed ... it was an experience like no other.'

Blue Whales are known to feed on krill at a 'foraging' area off the South Taranaki Bight, which is located close to where the animal washed up.
