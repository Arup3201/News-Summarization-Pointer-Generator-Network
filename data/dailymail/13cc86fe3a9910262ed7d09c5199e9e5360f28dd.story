A seven-year-old boy has been mauled to death by his family's two dogs.

Malaki Mildward died after two six-month-old canines attacked him on Thursday afternoon in College Springs, Iowa.

He was pronounced dead 50 minutes later.

Killed: Malaki Mildward, seven, was mauled to death by the family's two six-month-old dogs (it is unclear if was the dogs in this photo) 

Tragic: The little boy was unconscious by the time the incident was spotted by a relative. His father Xavier Mildward shared a picture on Facebook of Malaki, with the words: 'I love you so much my baby boy'

Police were notified shortly before 5pm.

By the time they arrived within minutes, Malaki was not breathing, a report said.

Emergency paramedics were also called to the scene to perform CPR.

It was reported both of the dogs stood by calmly as paramedics tried to save the child.

Unable to revive him, first responders transported the child to Clarinda Regional Medical Center, where he was declared dead.

On Friday, his father Xavier Mildward shared a picture on Facebook of Malaki, with the words: 'I love you so much my baby boy'. 

Malaki lived with his older sister, his mother, Amber Braymen, Jeremiah Hicks and Hicks’ son.

Page County Sheriff Lyle Palmer told Omaha.com that the dogs were mixed-breeds with some bulldog heritage, but neither would be considered a pit bull.

He said he saw the dogs in the pound Friday morning before they were euthanized and showed 'no aggressiveness.' 

Malaki's family also had another dog, a bulldog type that was not involved in the attack - it was also put down on Friday morning.

Palmer said Malaki often played outside with the dogs and there had no been any problems.

Six months ago Malaki's mother posted on Facebook: 'Have Pitbull English bulldog pups got shots and ready to go message me for details and pics.'

No arrests or charges have been declared.
