Five seals in Victoria have been rescued after their necks became trapped in potentially fatal ropes, thanks to a new marine response unit.

Graphic images released on Thursday  show the full extent of the damage caused by the plastic ropes which cut into the mammals' pelts and can cause the seals to die a slow, painful death from infection.

The images, taken in December and January, show members of Melbourne Zoo's AGL Marine Response Unit saving the mostly young seals from entanglement.

Second chance: A seal at Jan Juc, Victoria had a potentially fatal plastic rope caught around its neck and upper body removed by the Marine Response Unit

In the first image the Marine Response Unit is seen rescuing a seal at Jan Juc, near Torquay, after retrieving it in difficult conditions during a rising tide.

The second image shows a seal at Chinaman's Hat in Port Phillip Bay suffering because a piece of packing tape was choking its neck.

It was rescued and pictured just weeks later happy and back in the wild, with a shaved patch on its head so it could be identified.

The fourth and fifth images show seals on the timbers at Chinaman's Hat, with one pictured with a tight rope around its neck.

Seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers to relax in the sun, so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted.

Seals are very curious and they instinctively play with floating objects in the water, such as seaweed.

But when they play with floating rope or plastic it can loop around their neck, and they have no way of getting rid of it.

Local tour boat operators often spot seals that have become tangled in plastic and report them to the Marine Response Unit.

Melbourne Zoo vet Meg Curnick, who was involved in the rescue of the seal suffering due to packing tape at Chinaman's Hat, said the operations can difficult because seals duck into the water if humans try to approach them.

'The only way to get hold of that seal is to anaesthetise it and the only way to do that is to dart it with a dart gun,' Dr Curnick said.

'Often they'll shoot it and the seal's first instinct is to go in the water.

'Everyone needs to keep an extremely eagle eye on the animal in the water as it's slowing down and becoming sedated to grab hold of it.'

Dr Curnick said the rescues were very tricky and there was a lot of luck involved.

'Sometimes you'll try and help a seal that's entangled and it's even possible that they will drown which is a horrible, but when the alternative is dying a slow death from infection from cutting wounds it's preferred.'

Dr Curnick said young seals often get entangled because they are so curious they inspect a lot of things in the water.

But as they grow larger the plastic cuts into their pelts and can cause deadly infection.

The new Marine Response Unit was established in October last year and has since responded to more than 200 calls about wildlife caught in trouble.

Wild Sea Keeper and AGL Marine Response Unit Coordinator Mark Keenan described the results as very positive for Victorian marine wildlife.

'To be able to respond to so many calls for assistance in our first season has been terrific,' Mr Keenan said.

'We were able to save five seals from entanglement, but unfortunately there were also a number of cases involving entangled, sick, or injured seals that couldnâ€™t be saved.'

At the time of its launch, Environment and Climate Change Minister Ryan Smith said the unit aimed to protect and care for Victoria's 'incredible marine wildlife.'

The specialist unit is run of of Melbourne Zoo's Veterinary Department and head veterinarian Dr Michael Lynch said the marine response department had addressed an important need by becoming the state's first centralised point for marine wildlife welfare calls.

Most marine wildlife calls are made in spring and summer coinciding with yearling seals being forced by their mothers to become fully independent as they prepare to give birth in November and December.

Despite the work of the unit, some animals could not be save because of sickness, injury or entanglement
