Actor Johnny Depp cuts a mean figure on set of his latest film about notorious Boston mob boss James 'Whitey' Bulger.

The 50-year-old actor was almost unrecognisable in a bald cap and receding blond wig as he began filming a new movie about the gangster's life, called Black Mass, on Wednesday.

Tghe biopic will tell the story of 
Bulger, who last November received two life sentences and five years for
 his part in 11 murders and other crimes including drug trafficking, 
racketeering, extortion and money laundering in a 30-year reign over the Boston underworld.

He was eventually captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011 after 16 years on the run.

Guy Pearce will join Depp as Whitey's law abiding brother Bill  - former president of the Massachusetts Senate, while Joel Edgerton will appear as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly.

Dakota Johnson joins the cast as Bulger's girlfriend Lindsey - the mother of his 
six-year-old son Douglas, who dies tragically.

'The reason to play him is obvious to me,' Depp told Collider in
 an interview earlier this year. 'He’s a fascinating character.  It’s 
not like anything I’ve done before, on that level.  I’m very excited to 
slide into that skin for a little bit.'

'Meanwhile, one of Bulger's old hangouts 
is currently being painstakingly recreated in a Cambridge square in 
preparation for scenes in the movie, reports Masslive.com. 

Infamous South Boston dive bar Triple O's - where Bulger allegedly ran his gang and business enterprise - will be recreated for the film using the façade and interior of the Polish American Club.

Inspiration: Bulger was the inspiration for Jack Nicholson's sinister character Frank Costello in the 2006 Martin Scorsese movie The Departed. The film also starred Matt Damon (right) and Leonardo DiCaprio

Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California

The original bar is now a Japanese restaurant in the increasingly gentrified area known as 'Southie' by locals.

Sept. 3, 1929: James Bulger is born to Irish immigrant parents living in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood. He is the second of six children. His shock of platinum blonde hair earns him the nickname 'Whitey.'

1956: Whitey Bulger is sentenced to federal prison for bank robbery. After he’s suspected of plotting an escape from one prison, he’s transferred to Alcatraz.

1960: Bulger’s younger brother, William, is elected to the state House of Representatives. John Connolly, a childhood friend from South Boston, works on the campaign.

1965: Bulger is released from prison returns to Boston. He becomes a top underling to local mobster Howie Winter, boss of the Winter Hill Gang.

1970: William Bulger is elected to the state Senate.

1975: Bulger cuts a deal with Connolly - now a Boston-based FBI agent - to provide information on the Italian Mafia in exchange for protection.

1978: William Bulger becomes president of the state Senate.

1981: Roger Wheeler, owner of World Jai Alai, a gambling 
enterprise from which Bulger was skimming money, is 
shot between the eyes in the parking lot of his country club in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma.

1982: Bulger and Stephen “The Rifleman”  Flemmi gun down a former henchman in broad daylight on a South Boston street to silence him over the Wheeler murder. Connolly files a report with the FBI saying rival gangsters made the hit.

July 1982: Flemmi and Bulger order a hit on John Callahan, the former president of World Jai Alai.

January 1995: Bulger disappears on the eve of his indictment on racketeering charges.

1997: The FBI, under court order, admits that Bulger was a 'top echelon' informant launching a federal probe into the agency’s corrupt ties to its mob informants.

June 22, 2011: Bulger is arrested in Santa Monica, CA, with girlfriend Catherine Grieg.

Aug 12, 2013: Bulger is found guilty of a raft of racketeering charges, including his role in 11 murders.

Nov 13 2013: Bulger, aged 84 , is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus five years. Before announcing her sentence, the judge tells Bulger that the 'scope, callousness and depravity of your crimes are almost unfathomable.' She says they are made 'all the more heinous because they were all about money.'

Despite his eventual downfall, Bulger -  the inspiration for Jack Nicholson's sinister character in the 
2006 Martin Scorsese movie The Departed - was seen for years as a Robin Hood figure who
 bought Thanksgiving turkeys for working-class residents 
and kept hard drugs out of the neighborhood.

But that 
image was shattered when authorities started digging up bodies linked to
 Mob killings in the Boston area more than a decade ago.

Corrupt Boston FBI agents protected 
Bulger for years while he worked simultaneously as a crime boss and an 
FBI informant who ratted out the rival New England Mafia and other crime
 groups.

However, in
 1994, police and the DEA launched an investigation into Bulger's 
gambling operations, with the gangster and associate Stephen Flemmi set 
to be indicted.

But Bulger's former FBI handler and friend John Connelly tipped him off, allowing the criminal to flee with his common law wife,
 Theresa Stanley.

Missing her children, it was only a month before Stanley returned with Bulger, but he fled soon afterwards with his mistress Catherine Greig.

Bulger had been a great source of embarrassment for the FBI after he had infiltrated the Boston office of the bureau and bought off agents who protected him.

Some feared he would never be caught and he was soon placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List - at one point he was only second to Osama Bin Laden. 

FBI
 agents have told how they struggled to find a workable lead for ten 
years - nor did they have any good photographs of the pair.

They were aware of the couple's love of animals, but appeals to veterinarians proved unsuccessful.

There
 had also been reports that Greig had once had breast implants and other
 plastic surgery in Boston before they fled the city, and, grasping at 
straws, they turned to cosmetics surgeons in the hope of a clue.

To their astonishment, one came from Dr Matthias Donelan, who not only found her file in storage - but crucially, photographs.

It gave them the lead they'd been looking for and started putting out public service announcements on women's television shows asking if anyone recognised Grieg.

Then they got a call from a neighbour.

Deputy U.S. Marshall Neil Sullivan, who took the lead, said: 'The tipster specifically described that they were caring for this cat and their love for this cat.

'So that was just one piece of the puzzle on the tip that added up to saying "if this isn’t them it’s something we better check out immediately because it sure sounds like them."'

The pair were arrested in Santa Monica on June 22 2011.

Prosecutors at Bulger's two-month trial 
portrayed him as a cold-blooded, hands-on boss who killed anyone he saw 
as a threat, along with innocent people who happened to get in the way.

Bulger was defiant to the end, 
calling his trial a sham and refusing to testify
 or provide information to probation officials preparing a sentencing 
report for the judge.

Finally, on August 12 2013, a jury convicted Bulger in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with 
participating in but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a 
conclusion on an eighth.

Judge Denise Casper told him the depravity of his crimes is 'almost unfathomable,' calling them 'heinous' and 'all about money'.

Bulger looked directly at her, listening intently.

'The
 testimony of human suffering that you and your associates inflicted on 
others was at times agonizing to hear and painful to watch,' Casper said

'At times during the trial I wished that we were watching a movie, that what we were hearing was not real.'

She then sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences plus five years, as prosecutors had requested.

The new film is slated for release next year.

And director Cooper said he was determined to 'get to the root of the psychology and behaviour' in his film, telling Collider that he was looking forward to working with Depp. 

'I only want to work with actors to have a strong 
point of view and who want to race to set,' he said.  'And Johnny is that type of 
actor.  He’s always pushing himself and 
always playing something different.  He’s one of the best actors in 
American screen history. 

'Our hope is to really craft a full-bodied 
portrait in ways that you haven’t seen.  It’s exciting to see an actor 
like Johnny really attracted to a part like this because you’ve never 
seen him like this.
