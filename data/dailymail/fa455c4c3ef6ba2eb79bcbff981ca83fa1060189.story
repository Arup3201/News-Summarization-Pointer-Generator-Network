With Cristiano Ronaldo celebrating his 30th birthday in Madrid, Sportsmail reflects on the forward's illustrious career with a face-morph video showing how his face has changed over the years while chronicling some of his key moments.  

After graduating from Sporting Lisbon's youth academy in 2002, it took Ronaldo just one season in Portugal's top flight to draw bids from some of European football's elite suitors. 

In the end it was Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United who won the race to sign the prodigious teenager for a £12.24 million fee, handing him the club's famous number seven shirt.

At United, Ronaldo went from strength to strength, maturing from a tricky winger into arguably the most complete forward in the game, prompting Spanish giants Real Madrid to shell out a then world-record £80m to sign him in 2009. 

Barely fathomable though it is, the player has got even better.  

Ronaldo has scored 288 goals in 277 games in all competitions for Los Blancos and played a key part in helping the club to 'La Decima' (their tenth European title) last season.
