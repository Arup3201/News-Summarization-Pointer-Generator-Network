Mothers are known to be extremely protective over their babies - but rarely does it lead to a show of aggression quite like this.

These two lionesses came to blows after their prides crossed paths in the African bush.

Concerned about the safety of their cubs, both lionesses began fighting, sinking their huge teeth and claws into each other.

Protective: A photographer has captured the moment lionesses from two different prides go to war to protect their cubs

Spectacular: The show of aggression was caught on camera in Madikwe Reserve, South Africa

Brutal: The lionesses both sunk their large teeth and claws into each other during the fight

Photographer Michael Moss snapped the incredible moment in Madikwe Reserve, South Africa.Â 

Despite both lionesses drawing blood, they managed to both escape without any serious injuries.

Mr Moss, 62, a Salvation Army IT worker, from California, U.S, was on his ninth trip to the reserve but had never seen anything like it before.

He said: 'This was a first, the females were from two different prides that just happened to meet eachother.

Fight: Both lionesses put on the extraordinary display of strength because they had cubs to protect

Nasty: Both animals looked in extreme pain as they battled with each other throughout the fight

Damage: The lionesses had blood on their bodies as they tore into each other

'We could not tell a victor but females can kill other females cubs if they are from other prides.

'Luckily in this case both prides just seem to separate away from each other at the end.

'The lionesses fought with each other for several minutes.

'As far as we could tell there were no serious injuries. It was an amazing sight to see.'

Fortunate: Photographer Michael Moss was lucky enough to witness the fight

All over: After fighting for a few minutes, the lionesses leave the area

Lucky: Incredibly, both the mothers and cubs escaped unharmed from the fight
