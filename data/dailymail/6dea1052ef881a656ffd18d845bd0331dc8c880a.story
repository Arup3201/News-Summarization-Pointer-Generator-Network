They say that elephants never forget - but this confused baby certainly got himself in a muddle when he became separated from his herd.

The young elephant and his family became mixed up with livestock belonging to the Samburu community in the remote Ndoto Mountains in Northern Kenya.

But when panic set in, the tiny youngster - who was just hours old - became confused and wandered off with the herders and cows.

Thirsty work: Ndotto the elephant, who got separated from its family when it followed some cattle, takes a drink from carers at a specialist elephant orphanage in Kenya

Rescue: Barely a day old, the baby elephant is eased out of the helicopter by carers before undergoing specialist care

Back on his feet: Carers gave the tiny elephant a warm blanket and helped him support his body as he walked around. He had got separated from his family after following a herd of cattle in the mountains

Touch down: Ndotto was helicoptered to safety of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust elephant nursery

Too young to know any different and with a fresh umbilical cord and pink ears, the tiny animal trotted off with the cattle.

The Samburu community cared for the elephant, who had barely mastered how to walk, before one of them set off on a 24-hour journey by foot down the mountainside to find help.

The area was so remote, that a helicopter had to be chartered so it could be transported to the safe haven of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust’s elephant nursery, which specialises in caring for orphaned baby elephants.

After being discovered among a herd of cattle, members of the Samburu community looked after the animal for 24-hours while help was on its way

As a new born, the youngster will be given elephant plasma which is vital to trigger his immune system

The elephant was so young when it was found by farmers that it had barely mastered the ability to walk

Workers named the animal ‘Ndotto’ after the place of his rescue.

'At no more than 50Kg, the Keepers could easily carry him in their outstretched arms before they laid him in blankets in the stockades providing special formula milk and a glucose drip’ said Rob Brandford, Director at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.

'Unfortunately, whilst he was cared for by the Samburu community, he was fed cow’s milk – potentially life threatening for elephants who cannot tolerate this type of milk.

Weighing in at just 50kg, it was easy for carers at the nursery to carry the young elephant from the helicopter to his new home

The animal will be given a special diet including elephant plasma to build up its strength

'We’ll do all we can to remedy any side effects and be by his side all the way through the weeks, months and hopefully years to come.’

As a new born, he will be given elephant plasma which is vital to trigger his immune system - especially if he had not yet had the chance to ingest his mother's milk.

Mr Brandford added: ‘A rescue mission like this is a huge financial cost, and until his reintegration little Ndotto will require full time care and support.'
