Retail giant Big W has come under fire for selling novelty Christmas shirts with inappropriate slogans that activists claim sexualises young girls.

A festive shirt with the slogan 'nice baubles' has targeted the attention of one outraged shopper, who has started a campaign to have the shirt removed after spotting it in a Big W store.

Collective Shout spokesperson Coralie Alison spoken out against the sale of the shirts and said that the product could be harmful to young girls.

'These Tshirts can often have a double meaning and young girls can be innocently wearing them without realising the sexual connotation,' said Ms Alison.

'I expect more from a family department store like Big W. There should be checks and balances in place to ensure products that could be harmful to young girls are not ordered and approved for sale on the retail floor,' she said.

Outraged shopper Rebecca Holloway created a Change.org petition to have the shirt removed, and said that for 'a supposed family store to sexualise Christmas is just so offensive,'

'There is so much over-sexualised material in marketing. What is this teaching our children, particularly our young girls? Women are sick of being objectified for our body parts,' Ms Holloway wrote on the petition description.

Big W drew attention earlier in the year for introducing the controversial 'Scratch and Sniff' underwear range, which drew outrage from parents and shoppers alike

One supporter wrote, 'I am so tired of Big W using the sexualisation of women in its advertising and now this. I no longer even look through their sales magazines.'

Another supporter pointed to what they saw as double standards, writing 'So what is Big W trying to say here, they will, without protest remove nativity scenes, because it MIGHT offend someone but happily sexualise Christmas, what an embarrassment.' 

Ms Alison said that 'street harassment and violence against women [is] such a big problem in our culture, and this Tshirt draws unnecessary attention to women and girl's chests and can encourage passers by to comment.'

The range, which was removed by the chain after a torrent of complaints were lodged, featured scratch 'panels' in the clothing which released a sweet scent when activated.

Ms Alison said that Big W were 'repeat offenders' in selling products which sexualised young children and that she would like to see the retail giant withdraw the bauble shirt from their shelves

Parents launched a tirade of shocked protests on the company's Facebook page, demanding that the products be taken off the shelves, labelling the concept underwear as 'inappropriate', 'unecessary', and 'disgusting'.

'Sell what you want to adults but that age... It disgusting somebody even thought up that idea,' wrote one Facebook user. 

Another said, 'we should be taking a stand against this rubbish! Kids can't protect themselves, it's an adults job to make sure they are safe and not exposed to inappropriate behavior.'

Ms Alison said that Big W were 'repeat offenders' in selling products which sexualised young children and that she would like to see the retail giant withdraw the bauble shirt from their shelves. 

'I would like to see Big W...enter into discussions with Collective Shout about signing their 'Corporate Social Responsibility Pledge' to ensure no future products objectify women or sexualise children,' Ms Alison said.

'Women deserve to get through at least one Christmas without being objectified and degraded,' said one supporter of the petition.
