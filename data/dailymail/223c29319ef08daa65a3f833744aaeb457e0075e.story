The body of a man who was 'fueled by obsession' to find a legendary gold mine has reportedly been found in the remote Superstition Mountains of Arizona.

Jesse Capen, a 35-year-old bellhop from Denver, disappeared three years ago after heading off to find the 'Lost Dutchman's' gold mine - which has evaded adventurers for centuries.

For the intrepid explorer his quest to find the mine, on which he had read more than 100 books and spent all his free time, appears to have ended in tragedy.

Quest: Jesse Capen, 35, went missing three years ago in the Superstition Mountains while hunting for the 'Lost Dutchman's' gold mine

Peak of adventure: The 'Lost Dutchman's Mine' is believed to be buried deep in Arizona's Superstition Mountains

Hikers found remains last Saturday in a crevice around 35 feet up a cliff face, deep in the Superstition Mountains.

The discovery was made in a spot about 60 miles east of Phoenix, according to Maricopa County sheriff's spokesman Brandon Jones.

Rescuers had spotted a boot sticking out from the ledge, that was almost impossible to notice.

The remains have been sent to the coroner's office for identification but are believed to belong to Mr Capen.

An autopsy took place on Tuesday but results are not expected to be conclusive for several weeks.

The area where the body was found is half a mile from where the man's Jeep and belongings were found in December 2009.

The legend of the 'Lost Dutchman's' Gold Mine has been peddled for centuries.

Although it is believed to exist by many, no one knows exactly where because the 'Dutchman' Jacob Waltz (who was actually German) took the secret to his grave.

He reportedly shot people who tried to follow him into the mountains looking for riches.

There are several routes that have been mapped out to find the mine - but no one has ever succeeded and several have died trying.

In the 19th century, around 8,000 people would try to reach the mine every year - but the number has dropped down to the hardy few.

The former Arizona Attorney-General Bob Corbin is among those who have looked for the mine's existence.

As with all legends, stories have grown up around the mine - either that it is cursed or has guardian angels concealing the entrance.

Mr Capen's mother said he was obsessed 
with finding the Lost Dutchman gold mine and made dozens of detailed 
drawings and scoured maps trying to work out its location.

The Lost Dutchman’s Mine has been folklore since the 19th century - but many believe in its existence deep in the Superstition Mountain range.

Search and Rescue Director Robert Cooper told Fox: 'We call ‘em Dutch hunters out here.

'They’re infatuated with all the lore and the history of the lost Dutchman mine and he was part of that.'

Mr Capen's parents refused to comment.

A month after Mr Capen disappeared in November 2009, his campsite was found in the mountains, littered with books about his passion.

According to rescuers, he had booked into a nearby hotel for a month, then made three or four day trips into the mountains at a time.

Mr Capen, had been an employee of the Sheraton Hotel in Denver for ten years, and had made several previous trips in search of his fortune at the mine.

His colleagues said he would work almost constant night shifts and rarely socialized with anyone. His sole purpose seemed to be his search for the gold mine.
