Afsor Ali has been convicted of three counts of possessing terrorist material and will be sentenced next week

A London Underground security worker who warned of a terror attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding has been found guilty of possessing a library of terror manuals.

Afsor Ali kept a stash of al-Qaeda documents, bomb-making plans and extremist lectures on his computer and bragged that the 9/11 attacks were a blessing.

The 27-year-old also made YouTube video rants where he warned of a terrorist attack at the Royal wedding and called for a Burn American Flag Day in another.

After a three-day trial at the Old Bailey, Ali was convicted of three counts of possessing terrorist material and will be sentenced next week.

Dressed in a cream Islamic robe and white skull cap bearded Ali looked skywards and appeared to offer a prayer.

Ali was the spokesman of banned extremist group Muslims Against Crusades and was personally counselled by militant cleric Omar Bakri.

He denied speaking to Bakri about committing terror acts, but said he had sought ‘clarification’ on faith issues.

But prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said Ali promoted extremism in YouTube videos under the alias Abu Assadullah.

In a clip from 2011, he ‘warns the viewer not to attend the Royal Wedding since there’s the risk of an attack,’ Mr Glasgow added.

‘He explains to the viewer that the British public have no one to blame except themselves because of the inability to condemn their government.

‘He describes the 9/11 atrocity as a blessing and an eye-opener for the American people.’

The Old Bailey heard how counter terrorism investigators found a library of extremist material and MP3 players belonging to Ali.

A special edition of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire to celebrate the ‘martyrdom’ of Osama Bin Laden was also found on his gadgets.

When asked about two laptops, a Toshiba and Lenovo, he said: ‘If I’m in a conference and anybody there, if they want to use my laptop, they can use it. 

‘There’s a range of people there, but family have their own... sometimes there would be younger people there, they would say can I use your laptop.’

A hard drive of material was also seized, although Ali said he shared its use so did not know who could have uploaded the material to it.

Ali was 
investigated after he was arrested outside the American embassy in 
London on December 2, 2011, while leading a violent protest against 
drone strikes in Pakistan.

Police
 suspect the group of 30 masked men protesting under the name United 
Ummah and led by Ali were also members of Muslims Against Crusades.

After a violent altercation with police Ali was arrested and the MP3 player in his pocket was found to contain the Inspire magazine.

He was granted bail but attempted to flee the country but was stopped at St Pancras International on March 24 trying to board a Eurostar train to Paris with a passport belonging to someone else.

His computers were then seized from his home and found to contain a raft of extremist material, including bomb making tips and guides to using AK47s.

There were also recording of Ali on the phone with Bakri saying it would be ‘sinful’ to not go abroad and fight.

Mr Glasgow said: ‘This defendant and a colleague were seeking advice on the duty of Muslim males to participate in Jihad, and they discussed the requirement of Muslims to travel abroad to fight for Jihad.’

Ali, of Whitechapel, East London, was convicted of three counts of possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist, but cleared of one. He will be sentenced on August 12.

Before the trial Ali pleaded guilty to one count of possessing an identity document with improper intention.

After the conviction the breach of bail was put to Ali and he was asked if admitted failing to attend court without due cause.

However, Ali replied: ‘I believe I had a good cause and that is because I feel I won’t get a fair trial.’He will be tried separately for breaching his bail conditions.
