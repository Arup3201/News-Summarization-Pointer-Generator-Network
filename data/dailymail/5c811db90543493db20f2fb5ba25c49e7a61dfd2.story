A footballer and two Far Eastern businessmen were jailed today for plotting to fix the results of lower league matches.

Michael Boateng, 22, of Davidson Road, Croydon, south London, was found guilty alongside businessmen Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan, of conspiracy to commit bribery after a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Sankaran, 33, and Ganeshan, 44, described in court as the 'central figures' in efforts to influence the outcome of matches in League Two and the Conference South, were jailed for five years each.

Boateng, a former defender with Conference South club Whitehawk FC, was sentenced to 16 months for his role in the plot.

Sentencing the men, Judge Melbourne Inman QC, said: 'Professional football and sport play an important part in national life and individualsâ€™ lives in this country.

'Those who make determined attempts to destroy its integrity for personal gain must expect significant prison sentences so when such acts are discovered a clear signal is sent to others.'

The judge 
told Sankaran he would be 'liable to deportation' to his home country 
once he had served his sentence, but it would be a matter for the Home 
Secretary to consider.

He
 told the co-conspirators the detail of their scheme had been laid bare 
by covertly recorded conversations following an investigation initially 
by the Daily Telegraph and latterly by the National Crime Agency, back 
in November 2013.

To Ganeshan and Sankaran he said: 'I am satisfied you were at the head of this conspiracy, you two were the controlling minds.

'The
 two of you came to this country in November last year, for the sole 
reason of visiting clubs to find players you could corrupt to fix 
matches.'

He said they had clearly targeted lower division football clubs because the cost of bribing the players 'on their modest wages' was cheaper than approaching players from the higher leagues.Ganeshan and Sankaran had set upon 'a plan to corrupt professional footballers', according to Judge Inman.

'This was an, if not sophisticated, then well-planned and determined conspiracy motivated by the expectation of significant gain.'

The judge said it was 'sad to see' Boateng in the dock alongside the two businessmen and who, it was heard, had been a valued church and charity group youth worker in London prior to his crime.

Judge Inman told the former footballer: 'You allowed yourself to quickly be drawn in to this scheme' and said he had shown he was 'perfectly willing to corrupt other footballers' as part of the conspiracy.

Among the players Boateng attempted to recruit was one of his oldest friends, Hakeem Adelakun, who was acquitted of any involvement in the conspiracy.

Adelakun, 23, of Thornton Heath, south London, told the jury he had known nothing of the bribery scheme.

Judge Inman told Boateng his behaviour towards Adelakun showed he had been 'perfectly willing to bring an innocent young man into this scheme if you could.'

'It is, sadly, pure greed that allowed you to become involved in what Sankaran and Ganeshan were doing,' he added.
