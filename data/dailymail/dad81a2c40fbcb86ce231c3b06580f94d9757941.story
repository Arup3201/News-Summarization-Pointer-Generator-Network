A California woman is suing a reality TV show after nearly severing a finger when her hand was taped to a sledgehammer and smashed into a counter.

Courtney Muro is taking legal action against the DIY Network and Bathroom Crashers host Matt Muenster over claims she was injured during filming in July 2012.

Ms Muro, from Sacramento, said that she had been helping a friend whose home was due to appear in the show when she was hurt.

Legal action: Matt Muenster, who hosts Bathroom Crashers, is being sued by a woman who was injured during filming

With her right hand bleeding, Ms Muro claims that she was asked to sign a standard waiver of liability with her left hand.

During an appearance in Sacramento County Court on Tuesday, Ms Muro accused the show and network of negligence.

According to court documents seen by Kron 4: 'Bathroom Crashers host Matt Muenster wrapped the duct-tape around her hand to attach the sledgehammer.

'Plaintiff proceeded to swing the sledgehammer toward the counter. The impact partially severed her right index finger under the weight of the hammer against a broken piece of counter top.'

The counter broke the skin and muscle in Ms Muro's finger, causing her to go 'into shock at the sight of her exposed tendon'.

Claims: Courtney Muro alleged that she was made to sign a waiver form after she had been injured

It was only after she had been injured that the producer noticed she hadn't signed the waiver of liability.

'While plaintiff continued to suffer in shock and the bleeding from her right hand, plaintiff then signed the waiver of liability while using her left hand,' Court News reported.

Ms Muro is suing for emotional distress and claims Muenster should have taken better care of her during filming.
