The sleepy Dorset village of Highcliffe is a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of London's Oxford Street, but here lies one of its most famous traders.

The simple grave of Harry Gordon Selfridge at St Mark's Churchyard contains no clues about the lavish lifestyle the man who revolutionised shopping once led.

Selfridge was the  American entrepreneur behind Selfridge's, 
London’s famous department store, a self-made millionaire who 
turned retail on its head because he understood what women wanted and 
gave it to them in style.

The grave is covered in leaves and lies at the base of an ivy hedgerow, inscribed with only the few simple words 'IN LOVING MEMORY HARRY GORDON SELFRIDGE 1857 - 1947'.

Selfridge is laid to rest, separated by two unmarked graves, next to his wife Rosalie 'Rose' Buckingham.

During the years of the Great Depression, Selfridge watched his fortune rapidly decline and then disappear - a situation not helped by his continuing free-spending ways.

In 1941, he left Selfridges and moved from his lavish home. In 1947 he died, aged 91, in straitened circumstances at Putney, in south-west London.

At the height of his fortune, Selfridge leased as his family home Highcliffe Castle in Hampshire (now Dorset).

A member of the church committee who would not be named, said: 'It's a total shame and a disgrace that the grave of an enormously great man, be left without the due care and attention it so rightly deserves.'

Harry Selfridge’s incredible story — from the backwoods of Wisconsin to becoming the ‘Earl of Oxford Street’ — is now being told in an ITV1 drama, Mr Selfridge.

Based on Lindy Woodhead’s biography Shopping, Seduction & Mr Selfridge, it stars Jeremy Piven as Selfridge, and Zoe Tapper as a cocaine-snorting showgirl who becomes his mistress.

Harry Selfridge had a tough start in life. Born in 1856, his father deserted the family when he was just five, and his two older brothers later died, leaving Harry and his mother alone.

After getting a job as a lowly sock boy in a Chicago department store, Harry swiftly rose to the top and eventually opened his own store.

At first leaving his wife, Rose, and their four children in the U.S., he bought the now famous site on Oxford Street and set about creating a palatial, five-storey store. It opened in 1909 and was a sensation.

Selfridge was an inspired retailer. He invented the phrase ‘the customer
 is always right’, understood that shopping was about sex appeal and made Selfridge’s a London landmark.
