News that the NYPD are using equipment designed for the military in their policing of Occupy Wall Street might concern some civil rights groups.

However they will be pleased to hear rather than New York police officers using bazookas, tanks or grenades, they are employing sound amplifiers.

But the Long Range Acoustical Devices can blast a small area with 110 decibels of sound - equivalent to a car horn, a baby crying or a power saw.

A police spokesman insisted that the force is only using the device at Zuccotti Park as a loudspeaker and not as a ‘disruptive’ crowd disperser.

‘We set it up away from where a crowd is,’ an NYPD spokesman told the New York Daily News. ‘We create a 50ft safety zone.

‘It sends out a clear, uniform message that can be heard for several blocks,’ he said, adding it is not used as a ‘horrible noisemaker’.

The device was invented by a Californian firm after Al Qaeda bombed the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, reported the New York Daily News.

The tragic bombing of the destroyer by terrorists who approached in a small craft killed 17 sailors and injured more than three dozen.

But the LRAD device's hugely-magnified sound beam is intended to allow naval ships to communicate with anyone coming towards them.

The company admitted it can be used as a
sound weapon, but this is no different to somebody doing the same thing
with a car horn.

However critics say the $35,000 devices can cause hearing loss, headaches or nausea and should only be used for communication.

‘Making announcements that people can hear is always good,’ a New York Civil Liberties Union spokesman told the New York Daily News.

‘Using a sonic cannon to disperse people is not.’

At least 300 people were arrested in New York protests on Thursday and dozens elsewhere, including five on charges they assaulted police officers.
