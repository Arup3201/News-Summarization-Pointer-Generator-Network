Channel 4 was last night accused of ‘denigrating marriage’ by planning a show that will see couples marry on their first meeting.

Gone will be all the romance, planning and excitement of a traditional wedding, as a panel of TV experts play match-maker to six singletons.

The series, called Married At First Sight, will choose three men and three women to tie the knot, seeking to answer questions about how and why people fall in love.

Unusual weddings: Six singletons are going to be introduced at the altar and immediately married off on TV

But
 critics have condemned the show, in which couples will meet for the 
first time at the altar, as a ‘cheap publicity stunt’ similar to 
‘getting married at 3am in Vegas’. 

Participants
 will enter into legally binding marriages in front of their family and 
friends before setting about life as a newlywed couple, all the while 
followed by TV cameras.

Didn't last: Greg Cordell and Carla Germaine

The 
programme, planned for next spring, copies a similar experiment on 
Danish TV in which only one of the three couples decided to stay married
 after the show.

A former 
British attempt failed in 1999, when two strangers were matched up by 
Birmingham radio station BRMB, agreeing to marry in order to win prizes.

Former model Carla 
Germaine, 23, wed sales manager Greg Cordell, 28, on air – but the pair 
split just three months later and Miss Germaine went on to marry daytime
 TV presenter Jeremy Kyle, who had a show on BRMB at the time.

Married
 At First Sight will see the six people, selected from a pool of 200, 
put their love lives in the hands of psychologists, anthropologists and 
theology experts, who will analyse their values, looks and personalities
 to make matches.

Brides 
and grooms will first meet at their weddings, having never before set 
eyes on one another.

The show will then follow each couple for six 
weeks, after which they will decide whether to stay together or go their
 separate ways.

Last night, 
Simon Calvert, from the Christian Institute, slammed the programme as a 
‘terrible idea’, saying: ‘It’s disappointing that TV producers seem to 
be in this constant race to the bottom, and this is just another idea 
that denigrates marriage.

New show: The programme on Channel 4 (whose London base is pictured) is based on a successful Danish programme and will see a pool of 200 people reduced to six singles willing to say 'I do' - without having met

Clearly a marriage contracted between two 
people who barely know each other, who are doing it solely for the sake 
of a TV programme, is not showing proper respect for the institution.

‘Marriage
 is meant to be for life and contracting a marriage as part of a TV show
 ranks somewhere alongside getting married at 3am in Vegas ... it’s 
horrible for broadcasters to be experimenting with people’s lives in 
this way.’

Wedding planner 
Melanie Helen said: ‘The idea of simply plucking two people off the 
street and getting married without meeting is bizarre. Marriage should 
be between two people who love each other unconditionally, who know each
 other inside out and wish to make that life-long commitment.’

Channel 4’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt said she hoped to ‘take on Britain’s reputation as the divorce capital of Europe’.

Marriage in the UK is at an all-time low, with 15.7million adults not in a romantic relationship.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘Rather than undermining the importance of marriage this is an acknowledgment that statistically the institution of marriage has a vital role to play in creating an environment where committed and long-lasting relationships can develop.’
