The BBC producers who first signed up Jimmy Savile to present Top of the Pops had doubts over whether he was suitable and thought he was 'dodgy', it was claimed last night.

Savile's background as a club DJ and manager sparked initial concerns among the show's bosses in the early 1960s before the allegations of sex abuse that have now engulfed the BBC emerged.

Paul Jackson, the producer of hits shows Red Dwarf and The Young Ones,
 and a former head entertainment at both the BBC and ITV, said BBC entertainment producers initially 
rejected Savile.

'Dodgy': BBC producers had doubts about employing Jimmy Savile in the early 60s for Top of The Pops. Here he is presenting the show in 1962

Mr Jackson, 65, was a teenager at the 
time and his father, T Leslie Jackson, was one of the BBC producers who 
attended planning meetings for what became Top of the Pops.

He told The Guardian that his father had 
asked him as a teenager, who the top DJs were and he 
suggested Savile, having seen him at a ballroom in the north-west.

'My dad had been rostered to go to a 
group meeting at the BBC,' Mr Jackson said. 'They were 
thinking of launching what became Top of the Pops. When he came back 
from it, it was almost as if he was saying to me, "you made me look 
silly", as if I had been suggesting a gangster.

'A few days later he said to me, "he'll never work for the BBC". I didn't know exactly why â€¦ these things get said.

'But
 literally, a year or less after dad said that, Savile was the first DJ 
on Top of the Pops, which started in 1964. When I queried this he said, "things change". But he was an obvious choice. He was the most prominent
 DJ of the time, on Radio Luxembourg.'

Savile
 went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years and 
returned for the final edition of the weekly show in 2006.

Mr Jackson
 said he believed the reason for the BBC's initial reluctance to use 
Savile on Top of the Pops was because of his background in the club 
scene. As well as DJing he was a club manager in the 1950s but, according to Mr Jackson, he was thought of as 'dodgy' and 'you didn't cross him'.

A former Yorkshire committee member of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain has also revealed that he was strongly opposed to Savile having anything to do with the charity in the 1980s and 1990s, because of his background in clubs and 'reputation for entertaining young girls'.

John Oldfield, who was on the Yorkshire committee of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain from 1981 to 1996, and its chairman in 1989, said he didn't let him near the charity.

Mr Jackson witnessed at first hand the heady mix of frenzied fans and sexual freedom which characterised the broadcasting and music industries in the 1960s and said attitudes had clearly changed since then.

'I was around at the BBC during the 1960s because of my dad. It was a different time. It wasn't now. The commissioners were fighting to keep the girls out of the dressing rooms,' Jackson said.

'We had the Beatles, the Rolling Stones turning up at White City to do shows. There was buzz, then a scandal about payola.

Mr Jackson joined the BBC as a production assistant in 1971 and worked on some editions of Top of the Pops in a junior role early in his career. His credits as a producer include The Two Ronnies, Three of a Kind and Saturday Live.

After a varied career at the BBC, as an independent producer and managing director of ITV company Carlton, he became the corporation's controller of entertainment in 1997, several years after Savile had stopped working regularly for the organisation.
