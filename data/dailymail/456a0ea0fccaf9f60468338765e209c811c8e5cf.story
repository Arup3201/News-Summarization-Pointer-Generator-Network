A new survey has revealed that many probiotic drinks and supplements are likely to have no health benefits 

Many probiotic drinks and supplements are likely to have no health benefits, according to a survey.

In a number of them, the ‘good’ bacteria said to aid digestion barely even made it to the ‘target’ area, the small intestine.

Scientists at University College London put eight probiotic products through three tests and found only one passed them all. Study author Dr Simon Gaisford, of UCL’s School of Pharmacy, said: ‘Just swallowing them is no good if the stomach then kills everything.’

Researchers investigated whether products contained as many live bacteria as claimed, whether the bacteria survived passing through the acidic stomach environment and whether they then flourished in the small intestine. 

Four – Align, Biobalance, Bio-Kult and Probio 7 – did not pass a single test. Yogurt drink Yakult contained enough bacteria but failed on the next two stages, while rival Actimel fell short on the number of bacteria surviving the stomach.

Only water-based barley drink Symprove passed all three challenges. Bacteria in the product VSL#3 survived the stomach and flourished in the small intestine. However, it contained fewer live bacteria than stated.

The study, using pig stomach fluids, will be published in the journal Beneficial Microbes. It adds to the debate about the benefits of probiotics. Research earlier this week suggested a daily dose of friendly bacteria could stave off colds.

Bio-Kult said its capsules have been comprehensively researched. Yakult said independent studies showed its bacteria survived through the human gut at a high level.

Six in ten UK households regularly buy probiotic drinks and supplements, which claim to be bursting with health-boosting ‘friendly bacteria’.

The probiotic market is estimated to be worth £19.7 billion globally.

Dr Gaisford, said probiotics in liquid form performed better than capsules and recommended anyone using a probiotic should take it on an empty stomach after waking.

Dr Rob Hicks, a GP and media doctor, said probiotics were a ‘phenomenon’ and the ‘astonishing’ results should help shoppers make better decisions

Waiting at least 10 minutes afterwards before eating will help reduce the chance of the beneficial bacteria being killed by stomach fluids, he said.

Dr Rob Hicks, a GP and media doctor, said probiotics were a ‘phenomenon’ and the ‘astonishing’ results should help shoppers make better decisions.

‘Some people take them as a form of health insurance and some take them for chronic disorders such as IBS and are often not particularly satisfied with conventional medicine,’ he said

‘Lots of products claim to work but the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have basically said there’s not enough scientific evidence for probiotics to make health claims.’

Symprove weren’t involved in the research but did provide funding to write up the results.
