A mother was horrified after police refused to arrest a drunk driver accused of smashing into her car while she attended a children’s party.

Nicola McCormack watched on in shock as the man crashed into both sides of her car before stumbling into the pub next door to carry on drinking.

But she was even more livid when police failed to respond to the incident even though they’ve launched a campaign to stop drink drivers.

Shocked: Nicola McCormack, pictured, watched on in horror as the drunk man hit her car on both sides, before returning into the pub

Ms McCormack, 30, from Canvey Island, Essex was at a party for around 40 youngsters at Cheeky Monkey’s play centre on the seafront when the driver smashed into her car.

The man, thought to be in his 50s, then stunned onlookers by staggering from his vehicle into the Monico Pub next door to continue drinking.

Ms McCormack contacted the police after confronting the man in the pub who confessed to smashing her car and told them he was drunk.

But she was left gobsmacked when officers told her they could not attend because no one had been hurt, leaving the man free to get back in his car and drive off.

She said: 'The police say they are trying to cut down drink driving but then they just let one get away. It is absolutely disgusting. They should’ve come out he was so dangerous in that condition being behind the wheel.

'He could barely speak he was so drunk and just reeked of alcohol. He tried to park on one side of me and crashed into my car, tried to park on the other side and crashed into my car again and then crashed into some wheelie bins. It was just lucky that car park wasn’t filled with all the kids at the time.

'He went into the pub and had some more drinks and then drove off. 'If he had killed someone that would have been entirely the police’s fault for failing to respond. He was putting the public at serious risk.'

Concern: Police and Crime Commissioner Nick Alston said he understood Ms McCormack's concerns and frustrations with the police and said he would be following it up with the Essex force

Essex Police has launched its summer drink-driving campaign to crackdown on reckless motorists who get behind the wheel after boozing.

The annual campaign encourages residents to dial 999 if they know of someone driving while under the influence.

Police and crime commissioner Nick Alston, said: 'It is very important that everyone reports crime to Essex Police.

'Drink driving, if proven by a proper investigation, is a crime. 'My understanding is that Essex Police is actively following up on the information provided to them about this particular incident.

'It is important that the force does so, and I would also expect officers to ensure that anybody reporting suspicious behaviour of this kind is kept informed of the progress of the subsequent investigation.'

'I entirely understand the concern and frustration of the person who reported this serious incident, and I will be asking the Chief Constable for more details about this matter.'

A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: 'The incidents relating to a road traffic collision and suspected drunk driver were recorded, the appropriate circulations to units across the district and reporting advice provided.'

She added: 'However there were competing priority incidents at this time where offenders were arrested and as such units were committed.

'This was unfortunately a contributing factor to a lower level of service provided in this instance than we would expect.

'The road collision enquiries will be progressed in accordance with Essex Police procedures and a review of the service provided has been undertaken to ensure improved future performance.'

Essex Police carried out its summer drink-drive campaign throughout last month.

The campaign asked residents to do their bit in supporting police by stopping family and friends from getting behind the wheel if they’ve had a drink, calling 999 if they know someone is drunk and getting behind the wheel and reporting anyone who is known to be a regular drink-driver.

During the month-long initiative traffic cops breathalysed 2,616 with 94 people found to be over the legal limit or refusing to provide a sample.
