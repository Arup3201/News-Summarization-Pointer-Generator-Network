Divine intervention might be one way of explaining Southampton's miraculously lofty position in the Premier League, and Shane Long's tattoo could be its source.

The Saints striker showed off his religious chest ink from a hospital bed after posting a picture online to reassure fans he was on the mend.

Long fractured his ribs in the 3-2 FA Cup fourth round defeat by Crystal Palace at St Mary's on Saturday and was taken straight to hospital. 

Shane Long tweeted from his hospital bed reassuring fans that he was on the road to recovery

Infant Jesus meek and mild 

Look on me a little child

Pity mine and pity me

Suffer me to come to Thee

Heart of Jesus I adore Thee

Heart of Mary I implore thee,

Heart of Joseph pure and just

In these three hearts

I place my trust

Amen

The Ireland forward shared the picture on Twitter and said: 'Thanks for all the tweets guys. Feeling alot better today and am on the mend. Here's to a speedy recovery.'

Upon closer inspection the tattoo emblazoned across Long's chest appears to be the words of the prayer Infant Jesus.

The 28-year-old suffered the injury after a collision with Palace defender Joel Ward after coming on as a second-half substitute against Alan Pardew's side.

Long is likely to be sidelined for Southampton for several weeks.

The former West Brom player has scored four times for the south coast club since joining from Hull in the summer £12million.
