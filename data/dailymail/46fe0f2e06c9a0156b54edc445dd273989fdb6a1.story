The roommate of Martese Johnson, the black University of Virginia student whose head was split open during an arrest, had shown officers a real ID.

Speaking to ABC News, Joshua Kinlaw said 'it hit my heart' when he found out his friend had been involved in the bloody arrest outside the Trinity Irish Pub in Charlottesville early on Wednesday.

'There is nothing he could've said or done that could provoke an officer of the law to assault him in such a manner,' he said.

He added that contrary to the officers' suspicions, Johnson did not have a fake ID and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it.

'So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID,' he said. 'Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that's when dispute and discrepancies came in.'

After being turned away from the bar and questioned by police, Johnson was forced to the ground and pinned down. His bloodied face, caused by a gash to his head, was captured on camera and shared across social media. 

The student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the St Patrick's Day night incident outside the Trinity Irish Pub. He was released Wednesday morning.

Kinlaw said he believed the incident was race-related because so many other students on campus try to get into bars when they are underage but do not face the same sorts of assaults.

On Thursday, Johnson's lawyer, Daniel Watkins, shared the same story.

He explained that Johnson, a junior at UVA, was standing near the Trinity Irish Pub after midnight when a bouncer approached him and asked for his ID.

He asked Johnson about his zip code, and Johnson gave his mother's current zip code in Chicago, which is different from the old one listed on his current Illinois license, Watkins said.

Officers then questioned Johnson about being in possession of false identification, even though the ID was his, Watkins said.

'At no point during the encounter ... did Martese present a fake ID,' Watkins said.

They forced him to the ground, pinned him down and handcuffed as his head began bleeding, Watkins said.

Johnson did not speak at the news conference, but Watkins read a statement on his behalf, saying: 'I trust that the scars on my face and head will heal but the trauma from what the ABC officers did will stay with me forever.' 

He said he planned to fight the charges. 

Johnson, seen here on Thursday, was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice. He said through his lawyer, right, that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement'

The student (center) reportedly said the ZIP code of the address where his mother (left center, with son Michael, left) currently lives rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers

'I still believe in our community. I know this community will support me during this time,' he said in the statement. 

Protests erupted at the campus following the arrest.

On Wednesday night, a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate.

Johnson, a full scholarship student who had 10 stitches across his forehead, joined the protests, although he did not refer directly to the incident on advice of his lawyer.

'Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects to please respect everyone up here, we're all part of one community,' he told the crowd.

School President Theresa Sullivan made a brief appearance on the grassy field, but only spoke to several reporters and did not make any formal remarks to the crowd.

She released a statement saying that she was 'deeply concerned' 'contacted the Governor's office to ask for an independent investigation of the incident.' 

On Wednesday night, hundreds of students gathered at the University of Virginia campus to demand justice for Johnson. There was also a separate march through the town 

The hashtag #JusticeForMartese was posted thousands of times on Twitter and student protesters have used the phrase 'black lives matter' and said that the arrest of Johnson (second from left) was racially motivated

'The safety and security of our students will always be my primary concern, and every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence,' the statement read. 

Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo is expected to attend an open dialogue with UVA students on Friday to discuss his force's relationship to them. 

The Virginia State Police Association said Thursday that it was launching an administrative review and criminal investigation into the incident.

Police will conduct the criminal investigation along with the City of Charlottesville Commonwealth's Attorney. The officers involved in the incident have been put on desk duty.

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's office had released a statement Wednesday that called for state police to examine 'the use of force' by liquor control officers. 

ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past.

The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer.

Scene: The incident  occurred as Johnson stood outside Trinity Irish Pub just blocks from the campus

Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for an alcoholic beverage.

According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers.

Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped.

Johnson is scheduled to appear in court on March 26.

Rolling Stone fraternity rape allegations 

The University of Virginia fraternity was hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article. A police investigation  turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault.

Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year.

All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports.

However, the article later came into question when the Washington Post highlighted several discrepancies in the story - throwing doubt on whether the incident.
