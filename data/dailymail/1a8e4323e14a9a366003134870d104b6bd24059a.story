A sick, elderly woman was found in bed covered in her own waste, choking on rotting food and spitting up blood, police said.

Ruth Lockard, 84, died a week after she was removed from the home where she lived with her two sons William Lockard, 50, and 39-year-old James.

The two brothers were charged with cruelty to persons after they failed to properly care for their mother in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

Disgust: William Lockard, 50, (pictured left) and his brother James, 39, were charged with neglect after their bed-ridden mother was found covered in feces and blood at the home in Windsor Locks, Connecticut

Police had originally gone to the home on April 30 after an emergency call was made that the elderly woman was spitting up blood. 

When police and paramedics arrived, they were faced with an unbearable stench and rotting food strewn across floors.

In an upstairs bedroom, they found Mrs Lockard with human feces on her body and filthy bedsheets covered in waste and blood. Rotten food covered the floor of the room, according to the officer who witnessed the scene. 

'The odor in the room was completely intolerable and the living conditions were one of the worst that I have seen in 12 years I have been employed with the Windsor Locks police department,' Officer Andrew Dzierzgowski wrote in an affidavit, obtained by Courant.com.

House of horrors: The two adult brothers could offer little explanation to police as to why they had left their mother in such a deplorable condition at the Connecticut home

Mrs Lockard was taken to St Francis Hospital in Hartford where she died on May 7. The cause of death has not yet been confirmed.

Officer Dzierzgowski asked the brothers why they had left their mother in such squalid surroundings.

William Lockard simply shrugged his shoulders and offered no answer. His brother James said he was 'extremely busy' and could not find the time to look after the 84-year-old.

The brothers, who also had poor hygiene, said they had changed their ill mother's bedding and bathed her about two weeks before.

Police had previously visited the home in 2010 and recommended that the welfare department investigate living conditions at the home. It was unclear whether any action had been taken. 

William Lockard remains in custody after bail was set at $35,000 on May 16 while James Lockard posted $25,000 bail.

The brothers are due in court on June 7.
