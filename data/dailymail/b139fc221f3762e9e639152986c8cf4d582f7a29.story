He may be just 10 months old, but Prince George is already gearing up to fly a plane like his father.

And it seems granddad Prince Charles - who was handed a mini flying jacket for the royal infant - didn't know what to think of the prospect.

Holding up the gift from Stevenson Campus Air Hanger in Winnipeg, Canada, the Prince of Wales stared for a few moments before finally breaking out into a chuckle.

Nervous? Prince Charles stares at the mini jacket for George handed to him by Stevenson Campus Air Hanger

He then breaks out into a chuckle clutching the gift before setting off for a day of activities with Camilla

George's father, Prince William, has been an RAF pilot for five years, and is now training to pass his commercial flying licence.

And with his new jacket, it seems the little infant is all set to carry on the tradition.

Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, received the gift on the fourth and final day of their Royal tour of Canada.

Earlier, the couple celebrated the centenary of Winnie the Bear - the inspiration for AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories - in the Pavilion Gallery Museum.

Later, the couple were treated to a game of paper aeroplane-throwing with Prime Minister Stephen Harper

Camilla laughed as her aeroplane flew towards the cameras, while Charles deliberated on his target

The prince joked with photographers after his aeroplane went flying in their direction

The original Winnie was a female black
 bear who was bought as a small cub for $20 in Ontario by a Lt Harry 
Colebourn of The Fort Garry Horse, a Canadian Cavalry Regiment, en route
 to the Western Front during the First World War.

The
 bear was smuggled into Britain as the regiment's unofficial mascot with
 veterinarian Lt Colebourn naming her after his home city of Winnipeg.

Before leaving for France he decided to leave her at London Zoo where she become something of a local star and much admired, among others, by AA Milne's son, Christopher Robin.

Christopher Robin subsequent changed the name of his own teddy from Edward Bear to Winnie the Pooh, providing the inspiration for his father's much loved books.

Rounding off the visit, they celebrated the bear that inspired Winnie the Pooh and received this gift for George

The original Winnie was a female black bear who was bought as a small cub for $20 in Ontario during WWI

Beaming, Charles and Camilla were then shown a drawing of the famous fictional character at the gallery

On the final day of their four-day tour, Charles and Camilla managed to fit in feeding polar bears at Assiniboine Park

Stare-off: He held his gaze with a glint of a smile as the creature stared back at him seemingly wanting more food

The prince then gleefully obliged, pushing a piece of fish through the wire gate for the hungry bear

An exhibition devoted to the original 
Winnie and her AA Milne's character had Camilla cooing over some 
original EH Shephard drawings.

'They are just so charming, really charming,' she said.

Prince Charles looked genuinely delighted as he was presented with a toy cuddly black bear dressed in army fatigues for his own grandson, Prince George.

'It was worth coming just for that,' he said.
