Former LAPD officer Chris Dorner has become the hero of a violent new video game, which follows the murderer as he opens fire on police outside a burning cabin.

The game, dubbed 'Chris Dorner's Last Stand: A True American Hero,' follows the rogue cop as he fires at authorities in a setting similar to final standoff with police last week.

The 33-year-old's body was pulled out of a cabin in Big Bear Lake last week, hours after the home was destroyed by flames sparked by tear gas canisters.

Gaming: The goal of the new video game is to shoot and kill police officers as Christopher Dorner

Murder suspect Christopher Dorner, a former Los Angeles Police officer wrote a 'manifesto' about racial prejudices and corruption within law enforcement

Killer: The game was reportedly developed by online community 4chan, and takes after the popular first-person shooting game Doom

Life imitating art: At one point in the game, the cabin begins to burn like the actual cabin where Dorner was killed

The game was developed by online community 4chan, and takes after the popular first-person shooting game Doom, according to KTLA.

The game has also been seen as a racist attack for a background song that repeats the N-word and the fact that a player can increase their health by consuming buckets of fried chicken.

Also appearing in the game are Charlie Sheen, who made a public plea for Dorner to turn himself in after Sheen was mentioned in his online manifesto, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The video game comes as numerous protesters have come out of the woodwork in support of Dorner when he was cornered in the flaming cabin.

Dozens of protesters rallied outside Los Angeles police headquarters yesterday following one of the biggest manhunts in recent memory.

Protesters told the Los Angeles Times they didn't support Dorner's deadly methods, but objected to police corruption and brutality, and believed Dorner's claims of racism and unfair treatment by the department.

Many said they were angered by the conduct of the manhunt that led to Dorner's death and injuries to innocent bystanders who were mistaken for him.

Michael Nam, 30, who held a sign with a flaming tombstone and the inscription 'RIP Habeas Corpus,' said it was 'pretty obvious' police had no intention of bringing Dorner in alive.

'They were the judge, the jury and the executioner,' Nam said. 'As an American citizen, you have the right to a trial and due process by law.'

During the hunt for Dorner, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called for Dorner's surrender and said he didn't want to see the suspect or anyone else injured.

Dorner was already believed to have killed three people when he was cornered Tuesday at the cabin near Big Bear Lake, and during the standoff shot and killed a San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy, authorities said.

These masked men asked for additional investigation into why Dorner was not able to be captured alive

Others wanted to call attention to police brutality, while downplaying that Dorner was accused of killing four people

The burned-out cabin where Christopher Dorner's remains were found is seen Friday Feb. 15, 2013 after a police standoff Tuesday near Big Bear, Calif.

Only after calls for surrender and use of milder tear gas did deputies launch pyrotechnic gas canisters into the cabin, and the subsequent fire was not intentional, the Sheriff's Department said.

Dorner died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the end of the standoff, sheriff's officials said.

Dorner has already inspired a burgeoning subculture of followers.

While most don't condone killing, they see him as an outlaw hero who raged against powerful forces of authority, and some even question whether he really died.

Another tribute includes a ballad titled 'El Matapolicias,' or 'The Police Killer,' penned by a Mexican crooner with lyrics paying homage to Dorner.
