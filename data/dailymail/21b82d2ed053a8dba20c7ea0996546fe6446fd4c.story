As a starting point they perhaps should have analysed the printer's invoice a bit more closely.

A council has spent almost £21,000 on leaflets asking taxpayers for ideas on how it can save money.

Sheffield Council will send out 230,000 forms asking for ways on how to cut £57m from the 2012-13 budget.

Leader of the Labour-run council, Julie Dore, said each leaflet had cost 9p to produce, which was 'value for money'.

Among other things, residents will be asked whether they feel grass could be cut less frequently.

Opposition Liberal Democrat councillors called it a 'glorified PR stunt' and said the money should have gone towards protecting vital services.

The council said the leaflets had cost a total of £21,000 to produce and post.

Ms Dore said the letters are needed to allow members of the public to put forward their views.

She said: 'This is [the public's] 
opportunity to respond and participate in what is a very, very difficult
budget-setting process.

'They wouldn't get a chance to understand what dire circumstances we're in with these cuts and what it means to Sheffield.'

The
leaflet explains to members of the public that the council has a £1.5bn
annual budget and gives examples of some of the big costs involved.

Maintenance of the city's parks cost 
about £7m a year, while libraries, museums, galleries and leisure 
centres altogether cost £33m a year.

'It's all those other things that we need to know what's important to people,' said Ms Dore.

'[For
example], is it important to cut the grass in parks on a weekly basis 
or would it be acceptable to cut them fortnightly, so we can keep 
libraries open more than we would?

How Sheffield Council divides up its £1.5bn annual budget:

Education: £482mHousing: £216mCouncil tax and housing benefits: £210mAdult social care: £196mCentral costs and other services: £106m

'It's those sort of choices that we're expecting people to tell us about.'

Shaffaq Mohammed, leader of the opposition Lib Dem group, said the money should have been saved by the council.

'Instead of wasting thousands on this glorified PR stunt, the leader of the council should be using this money to protect vital front line services such as street cleaning or road repairs,' he said.

Mr Mohammed added that the consultation should have been carried out three or four months earlier because some decisions about next year's budget must have already been made.

'We are now almost at the door of the final closure of the budget process as far as I'm concerned,' said Mr Mohammed.

'If Julie Dore was really concerned about consultation [she] should have started this much earlier... Where are the options? What are the details? Where are you going to cut? There's no detail.'

People are being given until 6 January to comment.

Ms Dore said she did not expect to receive a 100 per cent response rate to the letters.
