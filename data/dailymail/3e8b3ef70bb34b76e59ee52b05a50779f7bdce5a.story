He sparked outrage amongst Jewish groups after releasing a pig-shaped balloon featuring the Star of David was released into the sky during a concert in Belgium.

And now rock star Roger Waters, who has urged others to boycott Israel, has earned himself another enemy - Israeli model Bar Refaeli, who has demanded he stop using her image in his concerts.

The supermodel tweeted in Hebrew an order to the former Pink Floyd frontman, ordering him to stop using her in his concert's video footage.

Roger Waters has demanded a boycott of Israel - but used Israeli model Bar Refaeli in his concert's footage

Israeli model Bar Rafaeli tweeted to the rocker telling him to stop using her image

She told him that if he wanted to do a
 boycott - which he says is aimed at highlight the Jewish state's 'apartheid and racist foreign policies' - he should boycott it fully.

The 28-year-old posted to the outspoken rocker: 'Roger Waters, you better take my picture off of the video art at your shows. If you're boycotting - go all the way.'

Her response is a stark contrast to her reaction in 2011 when she saw a picture of herself being used in one of Mr Waters' concerts.

'Crazy thing... Went to the Roger Waters show in Paris, and saw a pic of myself on the wall!!! #respect!!! I'm honoured [sic],' she tweeted, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The model's comment came a recent stunt which saw Water's large 
black balloon appeared towards the end of the musician's concert in 
Werchter, which opened his European tour.

Controversial: As well as the Star of David, the black balloon also featured symbols of organisations and regimes from around the world

As well as the Star of David, it also featured symbols of organisations and regimes from around the world.

The balloon provoked a furious reaction from Israeli groups as well as fans from the concert.

As reported by ynetnews.com, Alon Onfus Asif, an Israeli living in Belgium, said: 'I had a lot of fun, until I noticed the Star of David, on the inflatable pig.

'That was the only religious-national
 symbol which appeared among other symbols for fascism, dictatorships 
and oppression of people.

'Waters crossed the line and gave expression to an anti-Semitic message, beyond all his messages of anti-militancy.'

Waters is a known activist and has previously pushed for the boycott of Israel.

He responded to the criticism with an open letter on his Facebook page, saying the pig: '...is not ANTI-SEMITIC or PRO NAZI.

'I have often come under attack by the pro Israel lobby because of my support for BDS, (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) which I won't go into here, anyone interested can access a speech I made at The United Nations on the 29th November last year.

'However I will say this, in a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel, a state that operates Apartheid both within its own borders and also in the territories it has occupied and colonized since 1967.

'Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non violent protest.

'To peacefully protest against Israelâ€™s racist domestic and foreign policies is NOT ANTI-SEMITIC.'

Pink Floyd achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music.

They are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.

Founded in 1965, the band originally consisted of students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright.

The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are among their most critically acclaimed albums.
