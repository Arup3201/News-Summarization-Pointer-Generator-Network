Sex therapist Dr. Shirley Zussman has just turned 100 years old, and the bedroom-related issues she treats today are markedly different from those she did when she started out in the Swinging Sixties.

'The biggest problem now is a lack of desire,' she tells Time. 'And I’m shocked at the lack of connection between people because of iPhones - even though I love my iPhone! There is so much less of actual physical connection.'

Dr. Zussman, who still practices in New York, adds: 'You have to look at your priorities. We need touching to make us feel wanted
 and loved. That’s lacking so much in this generation. Lack 
of looking, lack of touching, lack of smiling. I don’t get it. I don’t 
get how people aren’t missing that, and don’t seem to think they are.'

Dr. Zussman was born at the start of World War I and graduated from Smith college in 1934, in the same class as revolutionary chef Julia Child, no less. Her gynecologist husband performed one of the first legal abortions in New York.

She started working as a sex therapist at a time when a sudden need sprung forth - just as the birth control pill was legalized. Back then, she says, sex was a good deal more 'frantic' than it is today.

She recalls the race to see and feel everything, because sex was no longer just about having babies, it was about 'pleasure.'

Back then, a lot of women came to Dr. Zussman because 
they found they couldn't reach orgasm, for which she generally 
prescribed exploratory masturbation.

'Lack of looking, lack of touching, lack
 of smiling...  I don’t get how people aren’t missing that,
 and don’t seem to think they are'

These
 days, however, she sees a lot of people for whom masturbation is 
actually the cause of sexual problems; particularly men, and 
particularly as a result of the internet porn explosion.

'I
 see that a lot in some single men who don’t make the effort to go out 
in the world to face the issues, face the possible rejection,' she 
remarks. 'They satisfy their sexual needs sitting in front of the 
computer and masturbating.'  

A generation of porn-addicts: A lot of Dr Zussman's male patients today don't get out into the 'real world' to risk facing rejection. 'They satisfy their sexual needs sitting in front of the computer and masturbating,' she says

On the cultural transition of 'casual sex' from the Sixties to now, she points to the AIDS crisis of the Eighties as one of the factors which slowed us down and encouraged a more measured approach to sex.

But do we now make love too little? Dr. Zussman claims that between the rat race of our busy careers and our non-stop push for attaining 'more' on every level, we are often literally too 'exhausted' to get it on with our partners.

Still, she may specialize in sex - or the lack thereof - but Dr Zussman maintains that at the end of the day, no matter what generation we live in, our bedroom antics don't trump all.

'Sexual pleasure is just one part of what men and women want from each other,' she states. 'They want intimacy, they want closeness, they want understanding, they want fun, and they want someone who really cares about them beyond just going to bed with them.'
