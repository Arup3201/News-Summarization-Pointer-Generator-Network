Identity revealed: The naming of Stuart Hall and subsequent publicity prompted other victims to come forward

The Stuart Hall case shows why suspects must be named when arrested or charged, open justice campaigners said yesterday.

At the time of his arrest, the shamed presenter’s lawyers criticised the Press for identifying him, citing the Leveson report which called for a ban on naming suspects held by police.

But Lancashire detectives confirmed that publicity surrounding Hall’s arrest led to further victims coming forward.

The former BBC radio and TV star, who had initially denied the allegations, later admitted a string of sex offences against girls.

Philip Davies, a Tory MP on the Commons culture committee, said: ‘This is a prime example and perfect reminder for people as to why an open system of justice where people are informed about who’s been arrested or charged is so important.

‘It can encourage other victims to come forward and make sure those people who are guilty of offences are brought to justice.

‘By maintaining any secrecy over arrests or charges, the only people who benefit from that are criminals who could use it to get away with crimes they have committed.’

There are fears that Lord Justice Leveson’s report on Press standards has encouraged police forces to restrict the public’s right to know who is being arrested and, in some cases, charged.

Following his arrest in December, Hall was quick to use the media to protest his innocence – and invoke Leveson.

His solicitor, Louise Straw, said: ‘Stuart Hall is innocent of these charges. He is unable to comment further at this stage.

‘It is a matter of concern that in the week following publication of the Leveson Report there appears to have been systematic, measured leaks to the media which have given a misleading impression of what this case is about.

‘Stuart Hall was not afforded the opportunity to attend voluntarily at the police station. In due course the decision that he should be arrested will be the subject of some scrutiny.’

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the fact that more of Hall’s victims came forward after he was named when arrested was a strong argument for more transparency.

He added: ‘There is a huge danger of secret justice replacing rights of the public, and indeed defendants, back to Magna Carta.

‘It is time someone put a stop to this frightening trend.’

The NSPCC said it was also against sex abuse suspects being given anonymity.

Spokesman Peter Watt said: ‘When a suspect is named in the public interest – for example when there is a child protection issue – it gives more victims an opportunity to come forward, which helps police build a stronger criminal case.’
