Wayne Rooney failed to keep control of his emotions last night as he was sent off in shame during England's match against Montenegro - the day after his father and uncle were arrested and bailed in connection with a 'football betting scam'.

The £180,000-a-week Manchester United star, who is worth £37million, lost control 17 minutes from time and kicked out at Miodrag Dzudovic.

It led England, who were winning 2-1, to concede a last minute goal.

And it provoked a stern response from 
angry manager Fabio Capello who, despite seeing his team qualify for 
Euro 2012, appeared to utter an Italian expletive in the direction of 
the disgraced player as he passed him.

Kicking out: Rooney was shown a straight red card for a moment of petulance

Capello had said on the eve of the game that Rooney was 'focused and calm' following the arrest of his father, also called Wayne, and his uncle Richie.

The pair were arrested on Thursday and bailed in connection with a spot-fixing investigation. Both deny the allegations.

Following last night's sending off, Rooney is now automatically banned from the opening game of Euro 2012 - probably the first two - although UEFA will decide the length of his suspension towards the end of next week.

Rooney is only the second England player to be sent off twice - the other being former captain David Beckham.

England drew 2-2 to secure top spot in Group G but Capello said: 'He made a silly mistake when he kicked the opponent.

The arrests of Wayne Rooney's father, uncle and seven other men followed a police probe into a rash of 'suspicious bets' placed on a sending-off.

Police were alerted after the Association of British Bookmarkers raised concerns about a number of irregular bets, ranging from £200 to £500, on Motherwell's Steve Jennings being red-carded, after he swore at the referee in a match against Hearts in December 2010.

Jennings had already been booked by referee Stevie O'Reilly when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time.

The 26-year-old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to 'stop cheating' Motherwell.

Some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in Liverpool - Rooney's home town. One bet of £500, placed at odds of 10/1, netted £5,000.

Former boxer Wayne Snr, 48, was arrested in a 7am raid at the lavish £450,000 home the striker bought for his parents in West Derby, Liverpool.

Richie Rooney, 54, was arrested at his home in Croxteth, Liverpool, while Jennings, a former Tranmere Rovers players who hails from Kirkby, near Liverpool, was arrested at his home in Glasgow.

The alleged betting scam is said to be worth £100,000.

All men deny the allegations.

'And he will now not be able to play the first game in the Euros. It's a red card. You can't defend that.

'I'm not happy, absolutely. I spoke with him. He made a silly mistake and he said, "Yes, sorry". More than that, I can't do.

'He's a really important player with a lot of experience and he's played really important games. But it's a silly mistake.

'Rooney was not happy because he missed some control and some passes. For this reason, I think he reacted. His reaction was to kick the opponent.

'It will be good lesson for him and the team. The player is frustrated from on the pitch not from what happened away from it.'

Goals from Ashley Young and Darren Bent gave England an early 2-0 lead but they were pegged back to 2-2 by a goal in the final seconds of each half.

Capello added: 'I can't enter into the head of Wayne Rooney when he plays. I can speak before. I can substitute him.

'I can find different solutions. But the reaction of the players, you cannot understand during the game, why things happen.'

When Andrija Delibasic equalised in stoppage time at the end of the game, the home crowd went crazy. The draw clinches second place for them and a chance to qualify through a play-off.

Home fans invaded the pitch and taunted the England fans. England's players ran for the tunnel to avoid the stampede.

It ought to have been a night of celebration for Capello's team but the late goal and Rooney's red card took off the gloss.

Montenegro manager Branko Brnovic said: 'I read in the newspapers that Rooney has some family problems in England. To be honest, I didn't expect him to play.'

Joe Hart said after the game that the England players had been disappointed by the antics of their opponents.

He claimed England had met with physical intimidation and questioned why there was not a red card for Montenegro.
