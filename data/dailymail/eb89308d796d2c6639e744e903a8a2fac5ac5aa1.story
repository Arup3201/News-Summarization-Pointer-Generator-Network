Five Brazilian towns were left without electricity - because a man had a row with his wife, it was reported today.

The domestic began when Reginaldo Rocha, 49, arrived home from work late after drinking with pals - and admitted to his wife he had blown over £150 on drink.

As the quarrel escalated, painter and decorator Reginaldo stormed out the house in Sorocaba, in the state of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil.

Head for heights: After a row with his wife, Reginaldo Rocha, climbed up a nearby electricity pylon and threatened to throw himself from the top

Dangerous: As the incident unfolded on last night, electricity company chiefs decided to switch off the supply so he wouldn't be electrocuted by the pylon's 80,000 volts

As the incident unfolded on last night, electricity company chiefs decided to switch off the supply so he wouldn't be electrocuted by the pylon's 80,000 volts.

But as a result five entire towns were plunged into darkness, affecting a total of more than 600,000 people.

Chaos: With no traffic lights working, the blackout caused chaos on the streets. The region's telephone system was also interrupted and even the national emergency number 192 stopped working

With no traffic lights working, the blackout caused chaos on the streets, Brazil's Jornal Cruzeiro do Sul newspaper reported.

The region's telephone system was also interrupted and even the national emergency number 192 stopped working.

As well as Sorocaba, the towns of Capela do Alto, Ipero, Aracoiaba da Serra and Boituva were also disconnected - an area of over 50 square miles.

Team effort: Fifty police officers and firemen, as well as Reginaldo's family, spent over three hours trying to persuade him to come down

Safety: Mr Rocha was eventually removed and taken to hospital where today he was still under observation. He could also be charged with undermining the safety or operation of public utilities, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail or a fine

Fifty police officers and firemen, as well as Reginaldo's family, spent over three hours trying to persuade him to come down.

His
brother, Valdir Rocha, said: 'He's worked for 30 years as a painter, so
climbing up a pylon is nothing to him. But he made a fool out of 
himself, we told him that.'

Reginaldo was eventually removed and taken to hospital where today he was still under observation.

He
could also be charged with undermining the safety or operation of 
public utilities, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail 
or a fine.

Public: A large crowd gathered at the bottom of the pylon and watched as Reginaldo Rocha refused to come down
