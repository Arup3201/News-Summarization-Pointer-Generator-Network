Police officers are used to being called out to all manner of bizarre emergencies.

But, as these pictures show, its unlikely many have had to deal with anything as strange as this.

Shoppers in Hemel Hempstead were yesterday left completely bemused after seeing a man walking up and down a street with a traffic bollard stuck on his head.

Confused: Shoppers in Hemel Hempstead were left baffled after seeing a man walking around with a traffic bollard stuck on his head

Rescue: A police officer pulls at the man's legs in an attempt to free him from the bollard

Delighted: The man looks thrilled as he is eventually freed from the bollard, two hours after first getting stuck inside

The joker, who placed the plastic 
cone over his head while playing with friends, was unable
to free himself and was stuck in the bollard for 
more than two hours.

Eventually, a police officer arrived at the scene and, with the help of the man's friend, they managed to free him from the cone.

The relieved man could not hide his delight, saying 'thank you so much' to the police officer.

Roofer John Waterman captured the moment on his mobile phone yesterday.

Mr  Waterman, 28, said: 'It was very random, it’s not the usual thing you see in the middle of Hemel Hempstead on a Sunday lunchtime.

'I came out of Burger King and this man had the bollard stuck on his head. 

'I had seen him walking with it on top of his head five minutes earlier, but now it was pulled right down.

'No-one was helping him because they thought he was just messing around.'

Funny: The man had been walking around Hemel Hempstead for two hours before the police were called to help. After arriving at the scene, this police officer could be seen smiling at the bizarre sight

Help: The police officer initially attempted to pull the bollard off his head

Amused: The policeman, who appeared to see the funny side of the incident, decided it would be best to lay the bollard-wearing man on the grass

After arriving at the scene, the policeman could be seen smiling at the bizarre sight.

Along with the man's friend, he tried to pull the bollard off his head. But when this didn't work they decided to lay him down on the grass.

Shoppers could be heard laughing as the police officer pulled the man's legs in an attempt to free him from the bollard.

Eventually, the man wriggled clear and could be heard thanking the police officer.

Tight: As the police officer pulls at the man's legs, a friend holds the bollard

Loose: Much to the delight, and amusement, of local shoppers, the man's hands soon appear as he begins to wriggle out of the bollard

Free: Eventually, the young man is released from the bollard. He thanks the police officer following his ordeal

Grateful: The young man repeatedly thanks the police officer who helped to release him

Mr  Waterman said: 'He didn’t seem to be getting too distressed but when he is finally pulled out he is very red in the face.

'It took his friend and a policeman to get him out. It needed a good heave and his back was badly scratched afterwards.

'The police officer find it very amusing and was chuckling to himself, it was probably one of his more light-hearted call outs!'
