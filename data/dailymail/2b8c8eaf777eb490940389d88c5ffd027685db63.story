The trust-fund granddaughter of a pharmaceutical magnate has upset the residents of her upscale New York condominium who claim they can smell cigarette and marijuana smoke from her apartment.

Jacqueline Lasdon, 27, a nightlife performer, moved into the Onyx Condominium last year and since then the board said it has been 'inundated with complaints concerning unreasonable and offensive levels of cigarette and marijuana smoke emanating from the unit,' according to court papers.

The board also said it has received numerous 'complaints concerning the regular influx of transient persons residing in the unit'. 

Jacqueline Lasdon, the trust-fund granddaughter of a pharmaceutical magnate, upset the residents of  upscale Onyx Condominium by smoking too much weed in her $2m New York apartment, a new lawsuit claims

Party girl: Jacqueline Lasdon, 27, a nightlife performer, moved into the Onyx Condominium last year and since then the board said it has been 'inundated with complaints' about smoke in her apartment 

Young heiress: Lasdon, who received a $25million trust from her late grandfather Stanley Lasdon, said the suit took her by surprise and says she doesn't hold parties in her apartment 

According to the lawsuit, the condominium 'repeatedly warned' Lasdon that she was violating building rules, but is now seeking a court order, as well as unspecified monetary damage and attorney's fees, to force her to stop what it claims is 'intentional and unreasonable' behavior.

Lasdon, who received a $25million trust from her late grandfather Stanley Lasdon, said the suit took her by surprise. 

She told the New York Post she 'definitely' doesn't smoke pot in the building, and quit lighting up cigarettes a few months ago after an upstairs neighbor complained. 

The apartment board  said it was 'inundated with complaints concerning unreasonable and offensive levels of cigarette and marijuana smoke emanating from the unit' after Lasdon moved in, according to court papers

Lasdon also said she doesn't throw parties in her $2million apartment and is only regularly visited by the same two friends.

'I heard everything was fine in the building,' she told the New York Daily News. 'They said there wasn't a problem.' 

Lasdon said she has only had problems with one upstairs neighbor, who she claimed was 'verbally abusive'.

'I haven't had any contact with any of my other neighbors,' she said. 'This is definitely a shock to me.' 

Lasdon trained to be an opera singer and now hosts dance parties. She also sometimes performs cabaret and DJs.   

Big surprise: Lasdon said that the lawsuit against her was shocking to her and says she only has contact with one of her 'verbally abusive' neighbors 

Performer: Lasdon was professionally trained as an opera singer but now she
