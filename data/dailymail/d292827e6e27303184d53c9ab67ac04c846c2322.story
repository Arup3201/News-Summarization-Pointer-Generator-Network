He was constantly mocked for his looks by his peers at school - but now rapper Example will be the envy of the same schoolboys who taunted him as he prepares to marry his beauty queen girlfriend

Example, real name Elliot Gleave, says he plans to propose to Miss Australia Erin McNaught within six months - and that he'd like to have children the following year.

Talking to The Sun, the 30-year-old singer says that while he was the 'happiest, most confident' person at school, he received constant stick for the size of his facial features.

Happy couple: Rapper Example with his girlfriend - and future wife - former Miss Australia Erin McNaught

'I was never properly bullied,' he 
reveals, 'but people would have a go at my features - teeth, lips, nose,
ears. The size my facial features are now - imagine that on a 
14-year-old. My teeth were the same size they are now but on a much 
smaller head. I was basically chastised constantly but I laughed it 
off.'

Example, whose third album Playing in the Shadows made it to the top of the UK album chart, says that meeting McNaught, also 30, has been a revelation.

In previous relationships he admits to acting like an 'absolute sh*t' - but with McNaught it has been different.

A real catch: Example says he 'can't risk losing' his beauty queen girlfriend, pictured here on the red carpet. The two hope to marry next year

As
Miss Australia (she won the contest in 2006) and a successful 
television presenter in Oz, she intimidated the rapper - and turned him 
into a 'giggly schoolkid.'

'When I met her, because she was 
famous and stunning, I was a bit stuck for words,' he admits. 'It's not 
like me - I'm normally a cocky b****** with girls. I don't get 
starstruck - well, only once with Stevie Wonder - but she turned me into
a schoolboy.'

McNaught has now left her home 
country Down Under for the UK to move in with Greave. The two frequently
discuss marriage and children, and Example admits he is planning to 
propose over the next six months.

Mocked: Example says he received constant abuse for his facial features as a schoolboy - but he had a very thick skin and never let the insults bother him. RIGHT, his future wife at a film premiere earlier this year

They will get married next year, and have children the year after, he says.

Clearly smitten, Example says McNaught is his best friend, trustee and partner. 'I don't want to lose her. I am happy now. We work well because I just can't risk losing her, but at the same time she excites me,' he says.

Example's album, The Evolution Of Man is out on November 10, and the single from the album, Say Nothing, on September 10.
