Satellite mismanagement has left America facing a data gap that will leave weather forecasters unable to predict to the movements of major storms, it has emerged.

As states along east coast batten down the hatches in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane Sandy, there are claims the country will be left blind to oncoming storms as ageing weather satellites wear out.

Experts are growing increasingly alarmed, with official estimates showing that the U.S. will be left with a gap of coverage for two years from 2016 that could 'threaten life and property'.

Most of the information forecasters have been able to gather about the path of Hurricane Sandy has been gathered thanks to orbiters which travel from pole to pole, gathering information as they go.

On the basis of that data they now know that Sandy has strengthened to nearly 1,000 miles wide with deadly winds in excess of 85mph, leading them to issue warnings to the 50million people living in its path.

The New Jersey shore is expected to take the brunt of the massive weather front - which forecasters said could be the largest in U.S. history - as Sandy hits near Atlantic City around 2am on Tuesday and churns north.

The worst of the accelerating Category 1 storm is expected to bring a 'life-threatening' surge of seawater up to 11ft high, coastal hurricane winds and a barrage of heavy snow in the Appalachian Mountains.

Users of the iPhone's voice-activated assistant Siri would have have got a shock if they relied on it for forecasts about the weather in New York this week.

One user who asked their phone about the storm which has led to the shut down of almost the entire U.S. East Coast and got the response: 'I don't see any reports of hurricanes.'

Unfortunately for Apple, the iPhone user in question is a member of staff on BuzzFeed, one of New York's leading social news websites.

She tried again, this time asking whether Siri knew of any reports of incoming thunderstorms. Siri answered again in the negative.

'No, I don't see any thunderstorms,' the app told her.

The New York Times reported how 84 per cent of the data used for Hurricane Sandy forecasts has come from the Joint Polar Satellite System.

This system uses satellites which fly pole-to-pole orbits each day carrying instruments to sense atmospheric moisture, temperature and other important weather-influencing factors.

However, the NYT reports how no less than three independent reviews carried out this summer into the U.S.'s $13billion weather satellite programme have raised serious concerns with its implementation.

The Commerce Departmentâ€™s inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and a team of outside experts each questioned cost estimates, criticised managers and called for urgent remedies.

The outside team were particularly damning in their assessment of the programme, which is run jointly by Nasa and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), condemning it as 'dysfunctional'.

Most worrying among their findings were that existing polar satellites were reaching the end of their lives, and in some cases had exceeded them, and delays have seen the launch of replacements has slip back to 2017 and 2022.

Craig Craft, commissioner of emergency management for Nassau County on Long Island, directly in the path of Sandy, told the NYT his team 'cannot afford to lose' any early warning systems.

In 1938 the area he is responsible for was struck by a hurricane that resulted in hundreds of deaths, and Mr Craft said he needed precise forecasts to know when to evacuate vulnerable people like nursing home residents.

'Without accurate forecasts it is hard to know when to pull that trigger,' he added.
