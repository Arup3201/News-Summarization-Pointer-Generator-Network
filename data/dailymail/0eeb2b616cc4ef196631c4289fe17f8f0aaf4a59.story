Retired captain David Gwynne James was meant to attend a Remembrance service at Westminster Abbey when he collapsed and had his possessions stolen

An elderly army veteran lay dying in the street while a heartless thief emptied his wallet and drained his bank account drained, an inquest heard today.

David Gwynne-James' bank cards were used at a cash machine as little as two minutes after the 74-year-old collapsed with a heart attack.

The retired captain and military history author had been preparing to attend a Remembrance Day service at Westminster Abbey, having organised memorials for his former regiment, the King's Shropshire Light Infantry.

He was pronounced dead two days later on November 11 last year, having suffered a massive skull fracture and brain damage in the fall, Westminster Coroner's Court was told.

His widow, Charmian, only found out about the fraudulent transactions when checking his bank statement two months later, by which time police had no leads because vital CCTV footage had been deleted.

Mr Gwynne-James had travelled to London from his home in White Notley, near Witham in Essex, on November 9.

At around 11pm, after spending the evening drinking with old friends at the Cavalry and Guards Club in Piccadilly he set off alone to find his hotel.

'He was observed by a witness walking along into King's Street, where he then suddenly clutched his chest and fell backwards, hitting his head as he fell,' said coroner's officer Lynda Morris.

Within minutes, paramedics had arrived at the scene near Christie's, the famous auction house, and began desperately trying to restart his heart.

The first attempt to withdraw money from his account took place at 11.03pm at a cash machine in adjoining St James's Street - just yards from where he lay.

Detective Constable Lynda Rothera told the inquest 'several other attempts' were made to take out more cash that night but failed when the account's daily limit was reached.

'It was used a few times the day after
in the east of London, in a few shops, before the bank raised a 
suspicious alert,' she said.

Some
Â£1,400 was withdrawn in cash, with transactions recorded in 
Walthamstow, east London, and Romford, Essex, before the account was 
blocked.

His grieving family later found out that his watch and glasses had also been stolen.

Detective Constable Rothera said Mr 
Gwynne-James may have been watched as he entered his PIN code at a cash 
machine earlier that evening.

She said: 'This is one possibility of how the suspects got his PIN numbers.

'We don't know whether that did happen.

'It is only speculation as to how this card was taken from Mr Gwynne-James.'

Mr Gwynne-James failed to regain 
consciousness after being taken to nearby St Mary's Hospital, where a CT
scan revealed he had suffered a 'significant traumatic brain injury'.

A pathologist, who found his right coronary artery to be entirely clogged up, found no evidence of assault and gave the causes of his death as heart attack and a head injury.

Mr Gwynne-James, who was born in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, served in the forces for 15 years after joining in 1955, captaining the army cricket team for two seasons.

His service included stints in Germany, Kenya, Cyprus, and Oman, upon which he based his book Letters From Oman.

In civilian life, he worked for accounting giant Ernst & Young, rising to become its personnel director, before starting his own management consultancy in 1991.

Recording a verdict of natural causes, Coroner Fiona Wilcox said the veteran's card was used 'almost at exactly the same time as he collapsed.'

She said: 'It is only speculation as to how this card was taken from Mr Gwynne-James.

'I do not think that this court can ever really know.

'There is no connection between this and his subsequent death.

'I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Gwynne-James died as a result of natural causes.'

Turning to the family, she added: 'Sorry we have not been able to explain why his belongings disappeared, or how they disappeared.'
