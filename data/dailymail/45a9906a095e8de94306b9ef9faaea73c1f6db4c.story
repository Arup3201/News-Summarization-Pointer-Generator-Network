Britain’s railways could be taken back into public ownership if Labour wins the next election.

Ed Miliband revealed he is examining ‘innovative solutions’ which could see the government replace the likes of Virgin, First and Stagecoach in running trains across the country.

The idea, backed by two-thirds of voters, would create a major dividing line with the Tories who have rushed to privatise the East Coast line.

The East Coast line has been run by the state-owned Directly Operated Railways since the Labour government took it over in 2009 when National Express walked away from the franchise.

Since then it has returned more than £600million to the Treasury and has seen passenger satisfaction soar.

However, the coalition plans to return the line to a private firm by February 2015.

But Mr Miliband accused the government of being motivated by ‘dogma’, against public ownership of major industries.

He suggested that a future Labour government could take other lines back into state control when franchises expired.

‘We are interested in innovative solutions when it comes to the railways. It's got to be affordable. That is absolutely definite,’ he told The Guardian.

‘The experience of East Coast, which has been in public hands, has been a good experience.

‘The government is dogmatically wanting to privatise East Coast. I don't think you should approach this issue with dogma on either side. So we are interested in innovative solutions.’

The idea was this week backed by Unite
 general secretary Len McCluskey, who said the public wanted to see the 
railways back in state control.

A YouGov poll last year showed 66 per cent of people wanted to see the railway companies run in the public sector.

It included 52 per cent of Tory voters and 79 per cent of Labour supporters.

Last year ministers spent £1million preparing to take charge of the West Coast main line from Whitehall before resorting to pleading with Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin trains to continue running his trains.

Five civil servants drew up a plan for the lucrative line from London to Scotland to be renationalised after the collapse of the franchise competition which had been won by Virgin’s rival FirstGroup.

But as the clock ticked down to the December 9 deadline when Virgin was due to be kicked off the London to Scotland line, ministers were forced to ask Sir Richard to stay on while they find a more permanent solution.
