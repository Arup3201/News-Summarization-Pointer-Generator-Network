A British newlywed has died after the plane he was flying crashed into the sea off the Australian coast.

Experts are investigating why the vintage Tiger Moth plane being flown by Alex 'Jimmy' Rae, 26, plummeted in to the water during an aerobatic flight.

Mr Rae, who recently married wife Alice, was killed along with 21 year-old French passenger Taissia Umenc.

Tragic: Alex Rae, 26, from Easingwold, North Yorks had recently married his wife Alice. He died on Monday off South Stradbroke Island, Queensland

Australian media have reported that Alex - originally from Easingwold, North Yorks., but living in Australia - radioed base before the accident saying: 'Conducting aerobatics over 3,500 feet' but then there was silence.

Pieces of the plane, including parts of the propeller and its ID badge, subsequently washed up on to a beach after the accident off South Stradbroke Island, Queensland, on Monday.

In a statement released through Australian police, Alice, who met her husband when they were both pupils at Easingwold School, said he died 'doing what he loved'.

She added: 'On behalf of all Jimmy's family and friends, we would like to thank everyone for their support and well wishes.'

Tributes have also been paid to talented boxer Mr Rae in the Gold Coast boxing community, where he used to train

A statement released by flight organisers Tiger Moth Joy Rides said: 'Our hearts go out to the family of the international visitor who has tragically lost her life.

'As a small tight-knit community we are devastated by the death of Jimmy Rae who was an experienced pilot with a passion for flying.

'Jimmy was an outstanding person who connected extremely well with his passengers and the rest of the team.'

The company has voluntarily suspended its operations while the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and Queensland Police investigate the crash.

Wayne Nicholson, a teacher at Easingwold School, who taught Alex graphic design and kept in touch with him after he left school, said: 'Whatever he got involved in, he was passionate about and gave it his all. He was interested in travelling and experiencing the world.'

Assistant head teacher John Butcher said: 'He was a popular student and the school is very sorry to hear of his death. Our thoughts are with his friends and family, particularly his wife, Alice, who was also a student of the school.'

Tributes have also been paid to talented boxer Mr Rae in the Gold Coast boxing community, where he used to train. Training mates have been rallying round to raise money for his family.

Stephen Ng, of Matrix Boxing Gym, told the Bulletin newspaper: 'Jimmy was a really nice guy. He would give everyone personal attention when you spoke to him.

'He treated everyone with courtesy and respect and showed a true interest in what you had to say.'
