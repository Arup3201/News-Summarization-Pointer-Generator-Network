She has recently gone from playing tough cop DC Rachel Bailey in TV's Scott and Bailey to a promiscuous single mother in theatre production Beautiful Thing.

With such a high profile career, it is no wonder Suranne Jones is going to extreme lengths to retain her youthful looks.

The star, 34, is reportedly a fan of anti-aging Cryolift facial freezing treatments - extreme facials that encourage the natural production of skin-plumping collagen.

The £250 treatments freeze skin to -15°C, supposedly helping enhance natural production of collagen to tighten skin making it appear more youthful.

A source said: 'Suranne is a prime-time TV star who, understandably, wants to look her best. Playing a gung-ho copper, she wears minimal make-up on set and has her hair roughly scraped back.

'If she can boost her appearance in any other way, she will. She tried a cryolift facial and absolutely loved it.

'It’s a non-surgical procedure but the results were fantastic and have really brightened Suranne’s complexion. She looks amazing,' the source told the Mirror.

The former Coronation Street star, who 
played feisty Karen McDonald for four years until 2004, was told about 
the treatment by a friend.

She now has regular sessions at the exclusive KX spa in Chelsea, West London, with dermatologist and TV beauty expert Malvina Fraser.

Described as a medi-facial, the process was invented in France and is said to make you look up to 10 years younger.

Supposedly enhances natural production of collagen, helping the skin look tighter

An LED light is first applied to 
treat skin pigmentation and heat the skin before a gel - either embryo 
cells of salmon caviar or tripeptide collagen - is spread on the face.

Finally, the electronically chilled 
cryoprobe is used to rapidly chill the area being treated. As the face 
freezes, the blood vessels widen, allowing more oxygen to reach the 
cells.

Cryolift freezing application has a very long history of use in healing - including for muscle fatigue, strains and damage.

It has been greatly developed over the last few years as a result of modern technology.

Cryoplasty aims to help improve the general tone, texture and tightness of the facial skin and neck area.

It usually comprises a course of six treatments for optimum results and can include a glycolic acid peel and various specialist skin products to further enhance the final results of the treatment.

These products can include glycolic 
acid, Vitamin C and vitamin-rich cellular poly-revitalisation formulas, 
coenzymes, hyaluronic and amino acids and minerals.

The skin is prepared with 
the peel and product treatments before the Cryolift machine is used to 
deliver a controlled amount of cold thermal energy uniformly cooling it 
and the underlying tissue.

The cooling promotes skin analgesia, dermocryphoreses and skin oxygenation, which radically acts on marked and fatigued skins to help regain firmness, tone and radiance.

Immediately following a Cryolift procedure skin should feel tighter, smoother and look more radiant.

The hour-long procedure is said to be relaxing and painless.

Negative side effects, while very uncommon, include swelling, rosacea, blistering, pigmentation changes, discomfort, itching - and even permanent scarring. Though it is also said to help heal scars.

Jones ditched the suits and slipped into a short leather skirt last month as she now takes on the role of single mother Sandra in urban love story Beautiful Thing at the Arts Theatre.

The comedy set during a hot summer on a Thamesmead housing estate, where love blossoms in some very unexpected places, returns to the West End to celebrate it’s twentieth anniversary.
