Frank Lampard brought the curtain down on his 13-year Chelsea career as his old club seized pole position in the chase for Cesc Fabregas.

England’s 35-year-old midfielder is lining up a move to Major League Soccer with New York City.Fabregas is available from Barcelona for £30million and Arsenal do not want to take up their first option for him. That leaves  Chelsea as favourites to buy the Spaniard in what would be a changing of the guard.

Lampard, who will captain his country in Wednesday’s friendly with Ecuador at the Sun Life Stadium, said he will always have Chelsea ‘in my home and in my heart’.

In a 
lengthy statement released last night, Lampard did not mention Jose 
Mourinho — the man he has always regarded as the best manager in the 
world — by name.

Lampard’s
 £150,000-a-week contract with Chelsea ends on June 30 and he is 
preparing to accept an offer from the new MLS franchise.

The
 player, who scored 211 goals for Chelsea since moving from West Ham in 
2001, winning three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the 
Champions League, is set to announce his international retirement after 
the World Cup.

In
 a statement, Lampard paid tribute to former chairman Ken Bates and 
current owner Roman Abramovich. He said Bates ‘put his neck on the line 
to sign me as a young player and without him I would not have even begun
 this experience’.

And
 he called the Russian billionaire ‘the man who saved our club and took 
us all to new levels. His desire to push the club to the top of the 
football world has rubbed off on everyone.’

Lampard called the club’s fans ‘the greatest in world football’.

Snub: Arsenal have not shown any interest in signing former captain Fabregas

‘You
 have supported me from the moment I arrived,’ he said. ‘Not only on the
 pitch, but in difficult moments in my personal life off the pitch. I 
will never forget.

‘I
 feel honoured to have shared so many special times with you. Bolton, 
Amsterdam, Munich, the list goes on. We could not have achieved those 
moments without your support.

‘Whatever the next challenge is for me I will always be among you and have Chelsea in my home and in my heart.’

On his way: Frank Lampard is leaving Chelsea this summer after 13 years at Stamford Bridge

Former
 team-mate John Terry said on social media app Fanzai: ‘Lamps, I’m going
 to miss you on and off the pitch mate. The best midfielder I’ve had the
 honour of playing with, you’re a true Chelsea legend.’

Atletico
 Madrid’s Koke emerged as one of Chelsea’s top midfield targets this 
summer but he is the man wanted by Barcelona to replace Fabregas.

Paulinho,
 of Tottenham, and Juventus’s Paul Pogba are others who have been linked
 with moves to Stamford Bridge but the appeal of Fabregas is his instant
 availability. A deal could even be completed before the World Cup.
