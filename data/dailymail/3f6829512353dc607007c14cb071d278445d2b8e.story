Manslaughter: Sharon Caslow, 65, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter

A woman has pleaded guilty today to leaving her 91-year-old mother sitting on the toilet for two days before she died.

Sharon Caslow, 65, of Cockeysville, Maryland had been indicted by a grand jury on six counts of manslaughter after her mother's death was ruled a homicide.

Caslow pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter on Tuesday.

Her mother Audrey Caslow was found by Baltimore County medical workers in the bathroom of the home she shared with her daughter on January 17.

Police say Sharon Caslow told officers
she knew her mother had been in the bathroom for two days but that she
didn't ask for help.

Audrey Caslow died ten days later after transferred to a hospice.

Medical
examines ruled that the woman had succumbed to renal failure, the abrupt
loss of the kidney's ability to remove waste and concentrate urine 
without losing electrolytes.

The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.

The charges weren't the first against the 65-year-old. Sharon Caslow had previously been charged with abuse of a vulnerable adult.

Indicted for her alleged crimes against her mother on August 15 she has since been released on a $100,000 bond.

Her public defender did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

She is due to be sentenced on March 27.
