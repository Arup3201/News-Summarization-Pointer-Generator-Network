A woman blighted by a severe food intolerance which restricted her to a rice-only diet is preparing for her first Christmas dinner in over a decade.

Former caterer Micaela Stafford, 53, lost 3st as her body started violently reacting to foods that included dairy, gluten, wheat, sugars, oils and fats.

She used to enjoy fried breakfasts, curries and roast dinners but was limited to bowls of boiled rice following physical reactions to nearly everything she ate.

No pain with grain: Micaela Stafford, 53, used to survive on a daily diet of rice because she was allergic to almost all other foods

Her unusual condition had left dieticians, 
gastroenterologists and even neurologists baffled.

With no solution she was forced to give up her
job and became housebound as her condition took control, leaving her husband Philip increasingly concerned.

For the past twelve Christmases she had to watch as her family tucked into their roast dinners while she sat with a portion of bland rice.

She told MailOnline: 'Every year my condition got worse. The first year it was Christmas pudding that I couldn't handle and last Christmas I could only manage one sprout.'

Mrs Stafford is preparing for her first Christmas dinner in over a decade following a nutritionist's recommendation

But in a dramatic turnaround the mother-of-two, from Normanton on Soar, Leicestershire  has overcome her debilitating illness which began in 1999.

After her story gained publicity earlier this year clinical nutritionist Diana Earnshaw got in touch via Facebook and suggested she should try slowly introducing new foods into her diet, and now Mrs Stafford is able to tolerate 40 different foods.

Mrs Stafford said: ‘When Diana got in touch, I thought it was worth a try, I'd tried everything else.’

Mrs Stafford is now on the hunt for a suitable stuffing recipe

Following the new diet plan she started by consuming nothing but clear meat broth, made from boiled chicken carcasses which contained only 10 to 14 calories per dish.

Eventually she was able to introduce stand-alone dishes, such as omelets and lamb chops, as her body built up resistance.

Now miraculously she is busy gearing up for her Christmas dinner which she will spend with her husband Philip and eldest son Michael, 34.

She said: 'I didn't believe this would ever be able to happen, I'm really looking for to people coming around and enjoying food again.

'We are planning on having turkey, sprouts, carrots, green beans, parsnips and potatoes, which will be cooked in goose grease, as this is an oil I can tolerate.

'Unfortunately there will be no mince pies or Christmas pudding but I might be able to manage some banana and coconut milk.'

She is also on the hunt for a stuffing recipe that will adhere to her dietary needs.

'There is a local organic farm nearby and I'm hoping they can make me up a special recipe.

'They have gluten free sausage meat and I'm hoping they can combine it with chestnuts.'

Prolonged migraines, sickness, diarrhoea and joint pains were all symptoms caused by the allergy that remains undiagnosed. 

A number of surveys have found that 20 to 30 per cent of people in the UK now claim to have a food allergy.

Mrs Stafford added: 'I really didn't think I would be eating Christmas dinner, but now it's mid November it really seems like a reality. But I still have a long way to go.'
