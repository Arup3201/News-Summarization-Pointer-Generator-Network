Two-thirds of hospitals have sent teams of managers abroad to recruit foreign nurses, an investigation has found.

And more than three-quarters are hiring nurses from abroad thanks to staff shortages across the NHS.

Many recruit en masse in groups of 30 or 40 at a time from countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.

But senior doctors are concerned that the nurses’ poor command of English and potentially inadequate training puts patients at risk.

Dr Peter Carter of the Royal College of Nursing said the NHS relies upon hardworking nurses from overseas

The Nursing and Midwifery Council, which regulates nurses, is forbidden from testing those arriving from Europe because EU law states that this would inhibit ‘freedom of movement’.

Trusts are increasingly resorting to recruiting nurses from overseas because there are not enough British-trained applicants to fill places. The lack was highlighted last February by a report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, which warned wards across the NHS were desperately understaffed.

An investigation by ITV News using responses from 74 hospital trusts found 77 per cent had recruited nurses from abroad since 2010. Two out of three hospitals had sent teams of managers to recruit groups of 30 or 40 at a time at recruitment fairs.

The investigation estimated that 31 per cent of nurses working in hospitals in England had trained abroad.

At the 64 trusts that were able to give a breakdown of staff members, 36,100 out of 114,669 nurses qualified overseas.

The Royal College of Nursing warned recruiting from abroad was an expensive quick fix. Chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: ‘Health care in the UK relies on the hard work and dedication of many nurses who trained overseas, and we must not underestimate their contribution.

‘However it is important that overseas nurses are being employed for the right reasons and in a manageable way. Recruiting from overseas is too often an expensive short-term fix when hospitals realise too late they don’t have enough staff. In the long run, the NHS must ensure that it is training and recruiting enough nurses to meet the needs of patients, and planning for those times when demand is greatest.

‘Without better forward planning, the NHS will spend its money on overseas recruitment at the expense of consistent staffing and high quality care.’

Last month, figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council showed that the number of EU nurses coming to work in Britain had doubled in four years.

There are now 20,914 on the register who can work in hospitals and care homes, up from 10,244 in 2010.

However, fertility expert Lord Winston expressed concern over some nurses recruited from Eastern Europe

Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘This sort of rise is really alarming. It seems we just aren’t training enough of our own nurses, we ought not to have this reliance on workers coming here from overseas.’

He added: ‘Again and again we have seen concerns about the communication skills of these workers, and communication is absolutely critical when it comes to healthcare.’

Since the NMC is prevented from carrying out tests on nurses before they join the register, it urges hospitals and care homes to do their own checks while interviewing them. But a poll of 100 senior NHS managers in June found that 52 per cent did not normally use aptitude tests when recruiting nurses from the continent.

One of Britain’s top doctors, Lord Winston, has expressed particular concern over nurses from Eastern Europe. The peer, a world-renowned fertility expert, warned in 2011 that they had been trained in a ‘completely different way’ to British nurses and were not used to speaking to doctors or even patients.

His concerns were echoed by Lord Kakkar, a surgeon, who said: ‘Quite frankly this is an intolerable situation.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Nurses recruited from abroad make a valuable contribution to patient care but they should only work in the NHS if they have the right skills.

‘There are 6,300 more nurses on our wards than in 2010. Trusts are responsible for planning and recruiting their workforce and ensuring they have the appropriate levels of staff.’
