A soap opera actress who has starred on 'One Life to Live' and 'Guiding Light' has escaped prison after allegedly smashing a pint glass into another woman's face in a bar brawl.

Crystal Hunt, 29, a former Daytime Emmy Award nominee, hurled the glass at the victim following an argument at Pearl's Liquor Bar in West Hollywood on December 13, prosecutors told TMZ.

The unnamed woman suffered a number of cuts to her face and required medical attention, while Hunt was arrested and charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon.

Yesterday, the actress pleaded no contest to one count of felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury, according to a statement by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.

If she had pleaded not guilty and been convicted of the charge, she could have been imprisoned for up to five years, OnTheRedCarpet.com reported at the time. 

But instead, Hunt avoided prison after LA Superior Court Judge Kathryn Solorzano sentenced her to three years of probation and 45 days of  work for the California Department of Transportation.

Following her arrest last year, the actress reportedly claimed she had been acting in self-defense when she threw the pint glass filled with water because the woman had been harassing her.
