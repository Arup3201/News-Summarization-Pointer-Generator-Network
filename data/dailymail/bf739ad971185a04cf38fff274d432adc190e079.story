What is it about diamonds? They may be a girl’s best friend, but the bigger and more famous they are the more they seem to bring bad luck.

This was certainly true of the Queen’s Necklace, probably the biggest diamond necklace ever made. The scandal it caused helped to bring down Marie Antoinette as Queen of France — though she never, in fact, possessed it.

The extraordinary story of the necklace has been the inspiration for a novel by Alexandre Dumas, a play by Goethe and an essay by Thomas Carlyle, but historians edge round it nervously because the truth is so hard to establish. Contemporary accounts are unreliable and full of lies.

Downfall: Soon after the Diamond Necklace trial Marie Antoinette was executed

Jonathan Beckman has tunnelled into the warren of misinformation like a badger digger and has come out with what must be as near the truth as we’ll get. At the beginning of the book he lists the characters most involved.

Let us concentrate on four. First, the necklace itself: 647 stones weighing 2,800 carats. This monstrous lump of vulgarity was designed by Louis XV’s court jeweller for the king’s mistress, Madame du Barry.

Unfortunately, the old monarch died before it was finished and the jeweller was confronted  with the new young queen Marie  Antoinette, who told him decisively that she didn’t want it.

Marie Antoinette’s character has been dissected endlessly and usually to her shame. She was accused of every kind of sexual misdemeanour. It’s hard to reconcile the rumours of orgies at Versailles with her actual habit of dressing up as a milkmaid on her miniature farm in the grounds.

People believed the worst of her, partly because her husband, Louis XVI, was known to be completely sexually incapable until, after seven years, doctors cured him.

Even then he showed little enthusiasm for his marital duties: he entered, stayed for two minutes, then withdrew, without leaving a calling card.

For all its absurd formality Versailles was a hot-bed of sexual liaison — marooned in empty country like a forerunner of Las Vegas, it was a combination of gambling den and knocking shop.

Its main occupation was gossip and, of course, much of that was about the supposed adventures of the Queen.

The Hope Diamond was supposedly cursed after being stolen form a statue in India. The first vicitm was diamond dealer Jean Baptiste Tavernier, who was apparently torn to pieces by wild dogs

One of the gossipers was Cardinal Louis Rohan. He was popular, pleasant and witty and had success with women — but not with Marie Antoinette, who hated him partly because she learned he had spread a rumour that she was having an affair with her brother-in-law.

To Rohan’s dismay, she either ignored or avoided him. He believed that her opposition was preventing the king from offering him a senior government post.

Enter a female firebrand, who set this situation alight: Jeanne de la Motte-Valois. With her complacent husband, she had clawed a place on the fringe of the court. They could barely afford their lodging at Versailles, but she was determined to insinuate her way into the inner circle.

Though she was not a beauty, Jeanne had immediate appeal to men. She was quick-witted, amoral, unscrupulous and very determined.

To attract the Queen’s attention she staged a fainting fit in a corridor when Marie Antoinette was approaching. She soon persuaded people the Queen had later sent for her and she had become a royal confidante (they were the same age — 29).

And there were letters signed by the Queen to prove it. Jeanne had secured the services of a forger.

Her next conquest was of Cardinal Rohan, who took pity on her poverty. He took her interests to heart and possibly to bed as well. She promised to speak to the Queen on his behalf and ask forgiveness for him.

But he wanted more, a meeting. So Jeanne obliged. She recruited a young Versailles prostitute who resembled the Queen in face and figure. The heavily veiled girl was given a rose to hand to Rohan and rehearsed a speech, which he believed conveyed that his future would soon be assured.

Rohan was then told that the Queen was short of funds and would be grateful if he could oversee the purchase of the Queen’s Necklace from the court jeweller.

Between them the sale was agreed. Price: 1.6 million francs (worth £30 million today). First instalment to be paid six months later. Rohan gave the necklace to a man he believed was a servant of the Queen. He was, in fact, an accomplice of Jeanne.

She swiftly had the necklace broken up and the stones were sent to London to be sold. She and her husband were in funds and lived very well.

But it couldn’t last. When no instalments were paid, a desperate court jeweller sought an interview with the Queen.  She was furious to hear Rohan had pretended he was acting on her behalf.

Marie Antoinette insisted that she wanted a public trial. She was to regret that later. Months of evidence — lying, contradictory, unbelievable — came tumbling out, transfixing the citizens of France and all Europe.

The wold's largest diamond - the Cullinan I - weighed 530.2 carats

Though she played no part in the actual story, many believed she did behind the scenes. It all blackened her reputation further.

Rohan was acquitted by a majority verdict. Jeanne was sentenced to be flogged and branded on both shoulders.

Marie Antoinette was executed by guillotine soon after. Napoleon said: ‘The Queen’s death must  be dated from the Diamond Necklace trial.’
