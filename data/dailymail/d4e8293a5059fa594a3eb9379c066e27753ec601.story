The mother of a convicted murderer who stabbed a chef to death today sensationally claimed her other son is the real killer after he signed a confession to the crime.

Nina Winter, from Bournemouth, Dorset, is making an extraordinary plea to the authorities to charge her elder son Danny Brand with the murder in a bid to free his ‘innocent’ brother Jake.

The 52-year-old said: 'I don’t want either of my sons to go to prison, I love them both, but if one is going to be in prison it should be the right one.'

Jake Brand, 23, was jailed for life last year after a jury found him guilty of killing chef Glyn Helliwell in Bournemouth in July 2011.

Mr Helliwell, 42, was walking home during the early hours when he was confronted by the Brand brothers.

The prosecution’s case was that Jake Brand stabbed him to death with a knife as he robbed him for his mobile phone.

Danny Brand, 30, was also arrested in connection with the murder but was never charged.

Jake claimed to a jury that it was his sibling who committed the act, although it took him five months to mention it as he had not wanted to get him into trouble.

Nearly two years after the killing, Danny Brand signed an affidavit confessing to stabbing Mr Helliwell in self-defence and that his younger brother was innocent.

Jake Brand took his case to the Court of Appeal this week to overturn his conviction on the back of this confession but it was dismissed by judges who said it was 'simply not credible'.

Miss Winter today insisted the police have jailed the wrong man and is seeking justice for youngest son Jake, who is facing at least 23 years behind bars.

She said: 'Danny told me what had happened at the time - that it was him and not Jake that killed the man.

'He said they came across the victim and he had a bottle in his hand, and he thought the man was going to go for Jake.

'Danny was just defending his brother but it all went wrong.

'I know my boys and I know Danny was telling the truth.

'My boys are no angels but they would never go out looking to hurt someone like that.

'Danny wrote a confession at the time but the police didn’t want to know about it.

'They just wanted to pin it on Jake because of his history with them.'

Danny, a builder, had been due to attend an appeal hearing in London this week but failed to show up.

Family members are now trying to track him down in the hope that he can convince the authorities that he is the killer.

Miss Winter, who has two other sons, added: 'I haven’t spoken to Danny since he signed the affidavit two months ago.

'He was supposed to turn up to the appeal hearing but he didn’t, and we’re now doing all we can to find him.

'I speak to Jake all the time, he calls me twice a week. I tell him not to give up. I have to have hope that Danny will do the right thing.

'I know him and he won’t be able to live with the guilt of killing a man and seeing his brother in jail for it.

'He has to be a man and do what is right. The victim’s family need to know the truth and justice must be done.

'I love my boys with all my heart, but it has to be the right one of them in jail.'

Mr Helliwell, who was a chef at the Bistro on the Beach restaurant in Bournemouth, had been on a night out at the time of his murder.

A court heard that Jake Brand, who has 70 previous convictions ranging from theft, assault and criminal damage, stabbed him with a 6in knife.

He later pawned Mr Helliwell’s mobile phone for £20.

The father of Mr Helliwell today said he is convinced the police have the right man.

Derek Helliwell said: 'I kept an open mind at the trial but at the end of it I was convinced that it was Jake who killed Glyn.

'I think the right man is in prison.'

A spokesman for Dorset police said they were satisfied with the outcome of the court case.

He said: 'The court case has concluded and we are satisfied with the result. We will not comment on further appeals.'
