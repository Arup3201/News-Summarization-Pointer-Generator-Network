I’m from Iowa in the American Mid-West, a friendly place where people smile, chat and even wink. So you’ll understand my confusion when I first arrived in Britain, a land where social mixing seems impossible without beer.

I love the people, the politeness and the scones. But when it comes to flirting, you British have much to learn.

As a social anthropologist, I’ve spent more than a decade looking at how men and women interact and I recently completed a four-country comparison.

Much to learn: Britons need to take notes from across the pond or end up going home alone at the end of the night, according to research

On the basis of what I found, I’m sorry to say flirting is all too rare in Britain – and when it does take place, it’s likely to fail. New Yorkers get right down to business; Parisians take refuge in ornate but time-proven ritual; but here people just give up and go home. On their own.

Britain’s problems start with men. Protocol dictates that men approach women. The guys know this, yet it’s clear they’re horrified at the idea of rejection.

‘Perhaps I am intruding  upon her and her friends,’ they think. ‘She might not welcome the interruption!’

New York men can cope with rejection: they laugh about it with friends, denigrate the  girl, buy another drink, and move on. But men here seem swallowed up in despair.

British women agree that the man should make the first approach. But women here, too, are at fault, because they give no clear signs of encouragement to the few men who dare.

Clueless Brits: According to statistics British men are particularly bad at flirting and most are unable to tell when a woman is flirting with him

What British women count as obvious eye contact is, to men, no more than a blink. When asked how they let a man know they are interested, women say ‘I look at them; I don’t need to do anything physical. The fact I’m listening makes them feel important,’ or ‘I do obvious body language, like pointing my knee in his direction while we chat.’ Such gestures seem to be lost on the intended flirtees.

It is no surprise that only 35 per cent of British men can tell if a woman is flirting with them. British men, it seems, like a good deal of reassurance.

‘It’s best when women do something deliberate,’ said one man. ‘Like put their hand on my knee or just tell me.’

British women are slightly better placed: 57 per cent think they are good at spotting flirtation. Yet it is the smallest percentage in the survey. In Paris, 53 per cent of men and 95 per cent of women think they know what’s happening.

British men are expected to make the first move, yet a full 30 per cent say they’d never approach anyone in a flirtatious way.

Perhaps, as I suspect, British men and women approach people they’ve known for a long time or,  better still, to whom they  have been introduced.

Flirt-phobia isn’t limited to a class
or social group. It afflicts even the rich and beautiful: I was 
recently asked to help Made In Chelsea stars Cheska Hull and Ollie 
Locke.

Despite their good looks and confidence, they still needed a few pointers on meeting the opposite sex.

I recommend lessons from abroad. In New York nothing is left to doubt.

Yes, women prefer the man to make the 
first move. But if he doesn’t, she makes the running herself. And if 
that fails, she just moves on, quickly.

In
Paris a complex game is carried out under the guise of serious 
conversation. Neither party will make genuine feelings obvious. If they 
do, they have ‘lost’.

Women in particular must keep feelings private, often even avoiding eye contact, lest they be thought ‘easy’. It’s amazing that anything happens at all. But it does, because men and women are both au fait with the rules of engagement and keep to them.

In gender-equal Stockholm, women feel free to make their interest clear. I’m not sure walking up to a man and saying, ‘Let’s go home now’ counts as flirting. But it’s effective.

In Britain, I’ve seen men and women talk for hours to people they don’t fancy because they don’t wish to give offence. And the result is stultifying.

Cheska and Ollie listened to advice and accept the need for a more direct approach. For all his confidence on TV, Ollie feels a bit inhibited in reality. Cheska now believes in flirting more often and more openly. She even got a date during filming.

After 13 years in Britain, I like it so much I’ve taken citizenship. But when it comes to meeting the opposite sex, someone needs to say something. So, here it is: if you’re interested in a person, tell them; if not, move on gently with a smile. It’s to your advantage. As the golfer Arnold Palmer famously said: ‘The more I practise, the luckier I get.’
