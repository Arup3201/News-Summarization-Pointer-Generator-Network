Google's (real) glass: The wearable computer will go on sale later this year costing £1,000

The Google Glass proves its worth immediately by reminding London that he is due to take the girl for dinner.

It then helps the hopeless Lothario by providing potential icebreakers – it brings up a photograph of his date with a dog, enabling him to inquire about her love of man’s best friend.

It even allows him to appear knowledgeable about his companion's favourite TV show, Downton Abbey.

Initially she is impressed by how much the two have in common however, things start to go downhill when she becomes suspicious of the instructions he is giving to control the Google Glass.

He also becomes distracted as the Google Glass allows him to watch American football, and play Minesweeper, while talking to her.
