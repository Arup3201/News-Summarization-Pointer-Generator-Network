On a morning that felt more like Paris in winter than in the springtime, Heather Watson further confirmed that she is back to her best form by reaching the second round of the French Open.

The 22 year-old Channel Islander scored her ninth consecutive victory by outpointing world number 66 Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova 6-3, 6-4 in 95 minutes to earn herself a big test against the tournament’s fourth seed Simona Halep of Romania.

Watson also guaranteed herself the tidy sum of £35,000 for winning a round, having already done the hard work of coming through the qualifying event. In tough conditions the British number two, fast closing on the injured Laura Robson, again showcased the attacking mindset she has adopted in climbing back up the rankings this year.

All smiles: Watson was in good form as the Brit won her fourth consecutive match in Paris

After so 
many problems last year, when she suffered from injury and a bout of 
glandular fever, there is increasing evidence that Watson has rebounded 
from it as a better player with more weapons at her disposal.

Court
 number six, which has hosted an extraordinary number of British players
 over the years including James Ward on Monday, was packed with so many 
supporters from across the channel that it will have felt like a home 
match for Watson.

With
 a gusty wind sweeping across Roland Garros control was sometimes 
difficult and in the fourth game Watson actually hit an air smash – much
 to her own amusement - before scurrying back to retrieve the ball and 
drawing a volleying error from her opponent.

After
 gaining an early break the Guernsey player faltered when she was broken
 back for 3-2 following an incident when she accidentally hit the net on
 her follow through while otherwise winning the point.

Although
 there were double faults on both sides she served it out without drama 
and the decisive break came at 3-3 in the second set. The experienced 
Czech mixed her game up far more in the latter part of the match, 
including putting in plenty of drop shots, but Watson had the nous and 
athleticism to be more than equal to it.
