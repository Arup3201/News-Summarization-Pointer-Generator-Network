Police have released audio of 911 calls made on Saturday night as a full blown riot erupted at an all-male juvenile-detention center in Polk County, Florida, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of damage.

Violence broke-out at the Avon Park Youth Academy after a basketball game between two sets of inmates blew-up into a full-scale riot.

In the 911 calls, officials at the center can be heard screaming for help and imploring emergency dispatchers to send as many units as possible.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of damage were carried out by inmates after a basketball game descended into a riot

‘It's full-blown riot out here ma'am. We need to get everyone out of here we can get,’ one detention center worker said to emergency dispatchers.

‘Every unit is involved – everybody is fighting – everybody, everybody!’ the caller said.

In a 911 call placed at 8:34 p.m. on Saturday and released by the Polk County Sheriff's Office on  Monday, an employee in the facility's control room can be heard telling emergency dispatchers that she wasn't sure how many juveniles were involved, but that officials at the detention center needed ‘urgent assistance.’

‘We have more than 100 youths, I don't know how many are involved. I'm in the control room,’ the woman says.

Then, a man's voice can be heard 
yelling in the background, presumably to other guards at the facility: 
‘We've got the authorities coming – stay out of it, aint nothing you can
do. Stay out of it!’

When a
group of offenders from St. Petersburg lost a basketball game to a 
rival group from Orlando they refused to pay up the agreed bounty of 
three packages of Cup Noodles, the instant ramen noodle snack served in a plastic form cup.

The disagreement quickly escalated into a riot at about 8:30 p.m. on Saturday night involving the majority of the 138 boys living at the facility.

The
riot lasted several hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of
damage was caused as the underage offenders burned buildings and stole 
golf carts at a juvenile-detention center.

Seven boys were injured, the most serious injury was a broken leg while others included lacerations and a concussion, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

Carrie Eleazer, a spokeswoman for the 
Sheriff's Office, said the juveniles' injuries occurred when they were 
fighting with one another and not when the youth were being taken into 
custody.

The
private detention facility is maintained by the Florida Department of 
Juvenile Justice, but run by the private correction company G4S.

When they realized what was a happening, they called the police because they are not equipped 
to deal with violence at the compound.

'Employees
are not allowed to have any specialty equipment to include pepper 
spray, which would have allowed them to deal with the fight before it 
escalated to a riot,' Eleazer said.

More
than 150 law enforcement officers from the Polk and Highlands County 
Sheriff's Offices, the state Department of Corrections, Florida Fish and
Wildlife, and the Florida Highway Patrol responded to the 911 calls and
the riot was contained by midnight.

Some
juveniles gained access to an office building holding their records and
set it on fire as well as setting a dumpster on fire. Eighteen of the 
20 buildings on the compound were heavily damaged.

By
the time authorities from several law enforcement agencies showed up, 
they were handcuffing all of the teens in 'flex' handcuffs.

Sixty-four
of the juveniles were transported to the PCSO South County Jail in 
Frostproof where they were placed in state custody. They are being 
separated from the adult inmates. The rest stayed at the academy.

Eleazer says the Sheriff's office is investigating the riot and will be issuing felony charges to those involved.

None
of the riot was caught on camera since the facility doesn't have 
surveillance monitors and the academy is in a rural area on the Avon 
Park Air Force Range.

The
juveniles housed at the academy are considered 'moderate risk'. 
Juveniles sent to the academy are between the ages of 16 and 18 and stay
an average of 270 days.
