A scrabble-loving grandmother is poised to become a bestselling author after compiling a list of high-scoring ‘wicked wee words’.

Sheila John, 76, spent five years creating the list of little-known three-letter words, which include such examples as zek, pyz, and zho.

These gems may be unfamiliar from everyday English, but they can reward players with up to 19 points – or far more if they  are placed on squares giving  double or triple scores for letters or words.

Loves letters: Scrabble enthusiast Sheila John, 75, sets up some of the 
high scoring three letter words she has compiled for her list

Mrs John, who has three grandchildren,
began writing her favourite high-scoring words down in a notepad to 
help her remember them for fortnightly games at her pensioners’ group. 

But word got round about Mrs John’s secret weapon and soon all her opponents were asking for a copy.

At first she would print out the list for friends.

Now Mrs John's list is to be published in a book 'Wicked Wee Words'

However, it became so popular that 
eventually her printer broke down after it could take no more.  It was 
then that Mrs John sought out a publisher – and to her delight they 
snapped up her compilation.

The book is entitled Wicked Wee Words: For Competitive Word Games.

With millions of Scrabble players 
across the world, the book – published in paperback and as an e-book – 
is well-placed to be a bestseller on Amazon.

The retired pharmacy technician from 
Little Neston, Cheshire, said: ‘The book was a valuable tool for me and 
my friends but I am just glad that it will be a tool for every other 
Scrabble player too.’

Mrs John, who lives with husband William, uses the same Scrabble set that she bought in 1963 to play.

The mother-of-three said: ‘I love Scrabble and have played it for as long as I can remember.

‘I started off with lists of words at home just for fun.

'My memory is not what it used to be. I often find a brilliant word and think "I’m going to remember that" but I often don’t and this solves that problem. The book was a valuable tool for me and my friends but I’m just glad it will be a tool for every other Scrabble player too.

'To be honest I only win as many games as I lose and I’m not the greatest Scrabble player in the world. For me its all about the enjoyment of playing the game. The most important thing if you want to win a game is a good night’s sleep the night before.

Show off: Ms John racks up the high-scoring word 'Glycyls' which, just in case you were wondering, is the amino acid radical or residue of glycine

'Initially I was printing out long 
lists of words for friends at home but I had so many requests that my 
printer gave up the ghost in the end.

'When another one broke I just 
thought I would see if I could get the list published as a book and a 
publisher said they would take it.

'I’m quite old to have just published
my first book but it is a thrill seeing the finished article. It was a 
bit of fun and I enjoyed compiling it even though I’m not a creative 
writer.

JIZ (19) - Another word for ejaculation

ZAX (19) - A tool similar to a hatchet

ZEK (16) - Prison camp slang for prisoner

FIZ (15) - Alternative spelling of fizz

FEZ (15) - A type of hat from Turkey

PYX (15) - A church receptacle

WIZ (15) - A gifted person

ZAP (14) - To destroy or obliterate

BIZ (14) - An occupation or line of work

KEX (14) - A type of plant

'I have no idea if it will sell well 
but Scrabble is as popular as ever, particularly in America, and I have 
got an American publisher.

'We love Scrabble in our family and 
all of my friends love playing. But it is aimed at older players who 
might get a little bit forgetful - just like like me.'

‘I liked writing down just short words
but ones that scored very high. They’re often very difficult to 
remember. I spent ages recording all the little words I could use. 
Eventually my friends could see I was using the list and they wanted one
too.’

Unlike other Scrabble dictionaries, 
her book is searchable by any letter in a word, rather than just the 
first letter. Focusing on short words that can be added to others on the
board, it could be a vital tactical weapon for players.

Mrs John said: ‘I’m quite old to have published my first book but it is a thrill seeing the finished article.’
