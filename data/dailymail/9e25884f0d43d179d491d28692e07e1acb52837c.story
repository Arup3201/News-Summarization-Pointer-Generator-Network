A property developer has released incredible before and after images that show how the bustling railroad tracks leading into New York's world famous Penn Station have had a 2.6 acre concrete platform built above them to create space for a massive new real estate project. 

On first view the area outside the station, which serves 600,000 rail passengers every day, appears to have gone from hosting a dozen railway lines transporting customers all over the United States, to the large concrete base of the $4.5 billion Manhattan West development.

But in reality the tracks are simply hidden from sight and are the trains are now operating as an underground service beneath what will soon become the foundations for two 60 storey office towers on West 33rd Street and Ninth Avenue.

Once completed the area will also an enormous retail park and a two acre green space for local benefit workers and to host community projects.

Skyline: The bustling railroad tracks leading into New York's world famous Penn Station have had a 2.6 acre concrete platform built above them to create space for a massive new real estate project

Before: Penn Station  is New York City's main intercity rail terminal - serving up to a thousand passengers every 90 seconds

During: In order for the construction teams to build the platform without disrupting rail services, construction teams used a $7 million crane dubbed 'The Launcher' to lay 16 separate 400 ton bridges

After: The 'bridges' were shunted together to form tunnels through which the trains continue to travel while construction goes on overhead

The Manhattan West development is the latest project by Brookfield Properties, whose workers have spent the past two years hovering precariously above busy railway lines as they built the massive concrete platform.

The developer said its construction crews worked day and night for much of that time in order to have the foundation finished by the end of this year, in order to get the construction of the office towers underway in early 2015.

Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Brookfield CEO Dennis Friedrich said: 'We celebrate today the creation of land in Manhattan - new land, which doesn't happen very often and which will serve as the support and platform for new buildings to go up in the upcoming years.'

Changes: The area outside Penn Station has changed massively over the past two years. The office towers are scheduled to open for businesses to move in at some point in 2018

Transformed: As can be seen in these before and after images, the tracks have been hidden from sight. The trains are now operating as an underground service beneath what will soon become the foundations for two 60 storey office towers on West 33rd Street and Ninth Avenue

As well as the 60 storey office towers, retail park and green space, Brookfield Properties plans to build an 800 apartment residential tower and a five star hotel on the site.

It will also be working to convert other buildings in the area into glass-based structures in order for them to fit in with the new development. 

Work on the residential tower is due to get underway early next year, with the first residents moving in at some point in 2017. The 800 apartments inside the building have not yet been put up for sale, Brookfield said.

The office towers are expected to open the following year.

Penn Station, whose official name is Pennsylvania Station, is New York City's main intercity rail terminal - serving up to a thousand passengers every 90 seconds. It is the busiest passenger transportation facility in North America. 

The original Pennsylvania Station was inspired by the Gare d'Orsay in Paris and was constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1901 to 1910. 

After a decline in passenger usage during the 1950s the original station was demolished in 1963 and replaced in 1969 with the current station. 

Resurgence of train ridership in the 21st century has pushed the current Pennsylvania Station structure to capacity, leading to several proposals to renovate or rebuild the station.
