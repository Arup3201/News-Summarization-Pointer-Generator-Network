The HzO coating is applied to components inside the phone and seals them against damage

Both Apple and Samsung are reportedly interested in a new hi-tech spray that makes smartphones waterproof - and Apple could even include the coating in its upcoming iPhone 5, rumoured to be due this summer.

The new 
'nanotech' spray coating  is applied to the circuitry inside phones and lets you dunk phones entirely 
underwater, and still takes calls.

Up to a million phones are 
water-damaged every year worldwide.

Fifty-two per cent of UK smartphone users who have water-damaged their phones admit to having done so by dropping them down the toilet.

In demonstrations a working iPhone and Samsung Galaxy were dunked into a bowl of water - and were still working even below the surface.

'We showed the Samsung Chairman the technology with a Samsung Galaxy S that we had coated with HZO and he couldn't believe his eyes,' a company spokesman told tech website Pocket-Lint, 'Samsung is really excited by the tech.'

The company claims to be in talks with Apple about including the technology in iPhone 5.

'We expect HZO to be in next season's phones,' the spokesperson told Pocket-Lint.

The HzO coating is a mix of various substances that spray over electrical components and protect them from water damage - even inside the ports on electrical devices

'HzO uses a unique coating processes to shield almost anything from water
and corrosion damage,' says the company.

'Unlike other water damage solutions, with 
HzO technology a device is not sealed, water is able to enter.

The hi-tech coating will be available 'pre-sprayed' on iPods and other Apple devices

'Instead, the electronic components inside the device are coated to 
provide protection, leaving the device unencumbered and always guarded 
against unexpected accidents.'

Even if Apple and Samsung don't sign up officially, part of the company, Zagg, is to incorporate the HZO coating into custom iPhones next year, and offer pre-treated phones for sale.
