Penalties: NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh, pictured, said surgeons who do not publish their death rates will face punishments

Surgeons who refuse to publish patient death rates will face penalties, a boss at NHS England has said. 

Patients will be able to compare the success rate of around 5,000 consultants when data relating to procedures  is published on website My NHS this week.

But roughly 2,500 surgeons do not publish this information - which provides details including mortality rates and complications in surgery.

Some surgeons have warned the move could lead to consultants refusing to take on difficult cases and argue the statistics do not take full account of the circumstances of each operation.

Speaking to the Sunday Times, medical director Sir Bruce Keogh warned that those who do not share this information will face penalties. 

He said that the move could lead to a better understanding of the best treatments. 

He admitted that the measures have already pushed some surgeons to quit and said that he expected more to do the same.  

Sir Bruce told the Sunday Times: 'We are looking now at a series of inducements, penalties to force that (publishing death rates).

He added: 'We will lose some surgeons. We will, and have as a consequence of this endeavour.

'The other thing that is more likely, and will help with quality, is that those surgeons who are doing just a small number of operations will think, "I'm not doing that any more", and they will pass on those operations to their colleagues.'

Sir Bruce and health minster Jeremy Hunt will also order hospitals to publish cancer survival rates from next year. 

Mr Hunt told the paper 'transparency' in data will help improve NHS cancer care. 

The information – central to Government plans for a more transparent NHS – aims to show patients how well consultants working in a number of specialities across England perform against their peers.

Patients can see the number of times a consultant has carried out a procedure, their mortality rates and whether or not they are performing within the ‘expected range’. 

The initiative aims to 'shine a light on variation and unacceptable practice', NHS officials said at the time.

But some doctors argued that publishing individual surgeons’ death rates could lead to doctors turning away ‘high-risk’ cases.

Writing in the British Medical Journal earlier this year, Professor Westaby, a consultant cardiac surgeon at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, argues that most deaths are related to ‘team dynamics’ and hospital infrastructure rather than the competence of individual surgeons. 

The move to publish surgeons' rates seeks to replicate the move four years ago to publish data on the performance of heart surgeons. 

League tables published last year provided information on specialities including vascular and orthopaedic surgery.

Public patient survival rates were said to have dramatically improved after previously restricted data was made available. 

At the time, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today vowed to name and shame health service staff who refuse to reveal data of their track record.
