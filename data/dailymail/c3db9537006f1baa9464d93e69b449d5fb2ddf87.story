Sneaking up behind this unsuspecting chicken, Dot the dog would appear to have dinner on her mind.

But don’t be alarmed – the border collie is merely demonstrating her sheepdog skills. And she’s very, very gentle.

The ten-year-old now rounds up poultry instead of sheep, and grabs any errant birds by the neck without digging in her teeth.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall  were given a lesson in the farming pecking order after watching a sheepdog demonstration on day two of their week-long visit to Wales.

The Royal couple watched as Dot the border collie attempted to round up a chicken grabbing it by the neck. 

Prince Charles and Camilla were visiting the Rhug Estate Farm Shop in Corwen, Denbighshire, today where they looked at local organic produce and met staff and guests.

The shop was built within the Rhug Chapel, a rare example of a converted private 17th Century chapel built by Colonel William Salesbury, who was responsible for holding Denbigh Castle for the Royalist cause during the English Civil War in Corwen. 

The shop first opened its doors in 2002 selling its own award-winning organic meat from a roadside takeaway and butchery. 

For the next nine years, it has supported local producers and increased its range supplying some of the best restaurants in the country.

In December 2011, the newly built Rhug Estate Farm Shop was opened to the public with a butchery and delicatessen. 

The shop is housed in a spacious oak and cedar building and was finished by local craftsmen.

Prince Charles is on a week-long visit to Wales and has a holiday home in Carmarthenshire

Prince Charles began his week-long annual visit to Wales - with locals near his holiday home in Carmarthenshire expressing their pride at his return.

Since 2008, the Prince of Wales has called the small rural village of Myddfai home for seven days.

But rather than shut the doors and draw the curtains - on what is officially classed as his holiday - the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall have gone on regular visits to communities and projects across the region.

Llandovery town councillor Nigel Burgess said locals now viewed the Prince as of one of their own.

He said: 'We're just a small town in the heart of rural Wales, so the fact that our future king chose this neck of the woods to be his home means a great deal to people.

'It's not only put us and local good causes on the map, but it's given us a tremendous sense of pride.

'It means all the more because this is supposed to be the Prince's holiday - but he's never put his feet up and locked himself in his holiday home.

'He's always got involved.'

Yesterday, Camilla hosted a tea party for seriously ill children.

Camilla chatted with youngsters - most of whom were battling life threatening illnesses, and their families in the home she shares with the Prince. 

The bash, held at a converted barn on the couple's Llwynywermod estate, was organised by Dreams and Wishes - a voluntary organisation that makes the dreams and wishes of terminally ill children come true.
