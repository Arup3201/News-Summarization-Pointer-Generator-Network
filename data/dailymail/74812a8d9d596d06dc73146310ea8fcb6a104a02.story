Chris Gorman, who once chaired the Gadget Shop chain, was arrested in Orlando along with his wife Mary after an employee at the city’s Roxy venue found two men and a woman in the men’s toilets.

Police had alleged Mrs Gorman and the other man were involved in a sex act – a claim that did not form part of the final charge.

Instead, Mr Gorman, 44, was accused of ‘interfering’ with police when they arrested his wife on August 13.

But Orange County Court in Florida now lists the case as closed. Mrs Gorman, also 44, was arrested for possession of cocaine and assaulting a police officer. She is due to stand trial in the New Year on a felony charge.

Mr Gorman, who is from Hartlepool but now lives near Glasgow, made his estimated £40million fortune in technology companies including the mobile phone retailer DX Communications and the internet services firm Reality Group. He sold the latter in a £35million deal.

He was awarded an OBE in 2005 – the year he played an active role in the high-profile Make Poverty History campaign. He rubs 
shoulders with tycoons such as Sir Richard Branson.

Mrs Gorman describes herself as a ‘creative entrepreneur’ with business interests in technology, music and beauty and the creative industries.

She is also a a charity ambassador

for Children.

But their arrest has raised questions about their lifestyle – as have a 
series of racy photographs posted on Mrs Gorman’s Facebook page.

In one picture, taken in August 2009, the Gormans pose with self-styled 
‘adult fantasy star’ Rebecca Jessop. Mrs Gorman’s black top has been

A spokesman said: 'The matter will not be proceeding to court. The State's Attorney decided that the matter was resolved by Mr Gorman's arrest.'

Although no further action will be taken, Mr Gorman's arrest record will remain on file with the State Attorney's office.

Police claim to have discovered the couple in a locked cubicle in the men’s toilets at the Roxy Club, a favourite haunt of disgraced golfer Tiger Woods, who lived in the area.

Officer Noah Pruitt said: ‘One of the club employees informed me that a white male, black male and a white female, later identified as defendant Mary Lang Gorman, were possibly having sex in the men’s restrooms.

'As we entered the men’s restroom, I noticed the stall was locked. Once the stall door opened, the white male was watching defendant Gorman performing a sex act on the black male.

'The white male and black male exited the stall, exiting the bathroom. Defendant Gorman was still inside the bathroom and was asked to leave several times.

'Defendant Gorman turned around and pushed me in the chest with an open hand. The white male was later identified as Christopher Gorman.’

An experienced felony prosecutor Michael Barber has been appointed to lead the case against 43-year-old Mrs Gorman.

Both the drugs and assault charges are third-degree felonies and carry a maximum sentence of five years each.

Mrs Gorman has denied all the charges.

A source with the State's Attorney's Office said: 'Assaulting a police officer is by far the most serious charge and could result in prison time.

'Lots of factors will be taken into consideration, such as previous arrests, but how much the couple are worth will not be a factor.'

Mrs Gorman will have to appear in court for her trial which is expected to last up to two days.

The Gormans live in a £2million mansion in Renfrewshire, near Glasgow, which boasts 33 televisions, a swimming pool, bar and disco.
