A former Marine incarcerated in Iran in 2011 and sentence to death on espionage charges was secretly retried and given a 10-year prison term, his new lawyer said.

Amir Hekmati has escaped death by being convicted of a new crime - practical collaboration with the American government - by a revolutionary court in December, after being caught working for the CIA.

The lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, also said his client had never been informed about the retrial, conviction or sentence, according to The New York Times.

Tabatabaei - who is well-connected to Iran's highest leaders - said he learned of the information in discussions with judiciary officials.

Iran charged Amir Hekmati with receiving special training and serving at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to Iran for an alleged mission. Hekmati has always maintained his innocence and said she was visiting relatives in Tehran when he was arrested. His death sentence has now been overturned

Hekmati is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen born in Arizona. His father, a professor at a community college in Flint, Michigan, has said his son is not a CIA spy

He then called Hekmati - who is incarcerated in Tehran’s Evin prison - and Hekmati’s family members in Flint, Michigan, who have long fought for his freedom.

The Times reported the news if the first status update of Hekmati's case in over two years.

Hekmati, 30, an American of Iranian descent who had been visiting relatives in Tehran for the first time when he was arrested more than two and a half years ago, has repeatedly asserted his innocence.

American officials say they have raised the issue in all encounters with members of the Iranian government.

But as of Friday, neither Hekmati nor his lawyer had received any written confirmation of the December conviction or sentence — not an uncommon occurrence in Iran’s legal system, which has been criticized by rights groups and the United Nations for what they call its secret, arbitrary and extrajudicial procedures.

However Tabatabaei has expressed confidence about the accuracy of the information.

The niece of Amir Hekmati joins the fight to free him. In Iran Hekmati's case is considered high profile and important for the direction of future relations with the United States

He also suggested that Hekmati could possibly be freed in a matter of months, particularly if the United States government released at least some Iranian prisoners, in order to start 'removing misunderstandings'.

He did not specify any of these prisoners by name or alleged offense.

The Department of Justice says 38 Iranian citizens are currently incarcerated in federal prisons for a range of offenses, mostly on fraud and drug charges but also on smuggling, burglary and violations of national security laws.

Inside Iran, Mr. Hekmati’s case is viewed as highly political.

He is considered a pawn in domestic infighting between hard-liners, who want him in prison, and moderates who want him freed as a good-will gesture to the United States.
