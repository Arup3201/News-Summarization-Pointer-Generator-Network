Presenter: Clare Balding refused to host coverage of the event at the men-only club

Clare Balding refused to host coverage this year’s Open golf championship at Muirfield because of the Scottish club’s ban on women becoming members, writes Chris Hastings.

‘I didn’t make a big song and dance about it but I felt morally I couldn’t go to an all-male club and sell this great golf event when I knew I wouldn’t be allowed there on any day of the week,’ the sports presenter tells Kirsty Young on today’s Desert Island Discs. Balding was asked to cover the Open, which was held in July,  for BBC Radio Five Live.

The openly gay Balding will, however, cover next year’s  Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, despite calls for a boycott due to the country’s increasingly hostile attitude towards homosexuals.

Balding, 42, who gained universal praise for her coverage of the 2012 Olympics, asks Young:  ‘What would be the sense of me not going? I would feel that we’d just caved into what Russia thinks and that would be silly.’

She also talks about her grandmother’s reaction when it was revealed she was a lesbian by this newspaper in 2003. When The Mail on Sunday approached Clare Balding, she confirmed she was in a lesbian relationship with fellow broadcaster Alice Arnold.

Asked by the reporter ‘Is this going to be a problem for you if we run this story tomorrow?’, Ms Balding replied: ‘No.’

The next day she recalls seeing her grandmother. Balding said: ‘I said, “Grandma, I need to talk to you.” She said, “Yes I should think you do.” I said, “Have you seen the paper?” And she said, “Yes, and I think it’s disgusting.” I said, “What, the invasion of my privacy or my lifestyle choice?” and she said both. I didn’t talk to her for about six months after that.’

Balding’s song choices include the theme for 1970s TV show Black Beauty and Caliban’s Dream from the Opening Ceremony of the London Olympics.

Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15am today.
