Two female Army officers testified Wednesday they provided nude photos to a general facing sex crime charges.

A
married captain testified that Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair repeatedly 
asked her to send him nude photos of herself, which she said made her 
uncomfortable.

Eventually, she said she placated the married general by 
sending him downloaded pornographic photos of other women cropped so 
that their faces weren't visible.

Charged: Army Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate relationships with several female subordinates

The 
testimony came during the third day of a hearing at Fort Bragg to 
determine whether Sinclair will go on trial for multiple criminal 
charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct and adultery,
which is a crime under the military justice system.

The allegations 
against Sinclair involve relationships with five women other than his wife.

On Tuesday a former subordinate to Sinclair testified that her superior
officer started an affair with her in Iraq and later threatened to kill
her and her family if she told anyone.

The
woman says she was honored at first by the attention from Brig. Gen. 
Jeffrey Sinclair, who she said was highly regarded. They first had sex 
in 2008 at a forward operating base in Iraq, she said.

'I
was extremely intimated by him. Everybody in the brigade spoke about 
him like he was a god,' the woman said, as Sinclair rolled his eyes and 
appeared visibly annoyed during her testimony.Â 

Now a captain, she was testifying on the second day of a military 
hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C., on whether there is enough evidence to 
court-martial Sinclair on charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful 
sexual conduct and engaging in inappropriate relationships.

She had earlier testified how he had grabbed her by the neck and forcibly sodomized her.

Sinclair is accused of using his rank to coerce women, including four female subordinates and one civilian, into sexual affairs and to sending him naked photos of themselves.

It is a rare criminal case against a general and the details from the 
hearing are the first public narrative of the alleged offenses.

During the testimony, Sinclair repeatedly rolled his eyes, sighed audibly and stared at his former aide from the defense table. She did not look at him.

The captain testified that she believed Sinclair's threats because he had gone through special forces training, knew how to kill with his hands and had a reputation as a killer in battle.

Trial continues: Sinclair's trial is now in its third day at Fort Bragg and witnesses continue to come forward

Sinclair was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May amid a criminal probe. He has been on special assignment since then at Fort Bragg, the sprawling base that is home to the 82nd Airborne.

Sinclair's former commanding officer, Maj. Gen. James Huggins, testified on Monday that he launched the criminal investigation that led to the charges after the female captain told him Sinclair forced her to have sex.

Huggins said that on March 19, the captain came to his office late at night in tears. She reported that she had been involved in a three-year sexual affair with Sinclair, then her direct commander and a married man. Adultery is a crime under the military code of justice.

Huggins said he knew the female officer to be a good soldier whom Sinclair had specifically asked to have transferred under his command.

According to Huggins, the captain said Sinclair had once forced her to perform oral sex on him, but that she also had sex willingly with her boss at Army bases in the United States and on deployments to Germany, Iraq and at the airborne division's headquarters in Afghanistan.

When she had tried to end the affair, Sinclair had threatened her and persisted in pushing for sex, according to Huggins' testimony. But she also told Huggins she finally decided to report Sinclair after finding emails exchanged with other women in his account.

Sinclair is accused of 26 
violations of military law including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual 
conduct, possessing pornography while deployed and conduct unbecoming of
an officer.

Sinclair's
attorney asked for the charges to be thrown out, arguing that 
prosecutors had read confidential emails between the general and his 
defense.

Defense attorney Lt. Col. Jackie Thompson said this violated 
his client's rights and asked that new prosecutors be brought in to try 
the case.

The hearing officer called a recess until early Monday afternoon to give a legal adviser time to review the documents.
