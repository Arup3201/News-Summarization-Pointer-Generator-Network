MARK WEBSTER: Joey Barton's analogy, in his opening gambit about UKIP's European success was awkward and annoying

QPR midfielder Joey Barton was forced to apologise after a heated UKIP debate during his debut appearance on BBC's Question Time on Thursday night.

The 31-year-old's first contribution was to take on UKIP as he made the point that the support for the party at the recent European 
Parliament election was a protest vote.

Barton, who is well known for his out-spoken nature on Twitter, said: 'If I'm somewhere and there was four really ugly girls, I'm thinking... well, she's not the worst - that's all you [UKIP] are.'

UKIP MEP Louise Bours hit back by saying his 'offensive' comment, which caused gasps of disbelief in the audience, 'fulfills the mission footballers' brains are in their feet'.

Barton later apologised after a member of the audience said his analogy would 'be all over Twitter'.

He said: 'I apologise. I couldn't think of a better one. It's my first time. Maybe I was a little bit nervous.'

Barton,
 wearing a polo-shirt in stark contrast to the rest of the panelists, 
was introduced by presenter David Dimbleby as 'football's philosopher 
king'.

Barton was also joined on the panel by Piers Morgan, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland Margaret Curran and Conservative MP David Willets for the debate held at the new Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport.

After the show, Barton tweeted: 'Very nerve wrecking experience, give me Wembley and 87,000 any day of the week. Great experience though.

Referring to his analogy, he wrote: 'Should have left it at 'Best of a bad bunch' Ah well #imnewtothis.'

In a tweet reply to Morgan, Barton wrote: 'I may have upset one or two women with an ill conceived metaphor. #imnewtothis.'
