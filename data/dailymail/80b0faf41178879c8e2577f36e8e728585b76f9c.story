Disgraced MP Mike Hancock is to stand for Parliament again, months after being forced out of the Lib Dems after a string of sex scandals.

The veteran Portsmouth South MP resigned from Nick Clegg's party after being forced publicly to apologise to a vulnerable woman constituent for making improper sexual advances.

But he has now vowed to stand as an independent candidate, continuing a colourful political career, which has included an affair with a woman accused of being a Russian spy.

Disgraced MP Mike Hancock is to stand for Parliament again, months after being forced out of the Lib Dems after a string of sex scandals

After being removed from the Lib Dem party, it was expected that Mr Hancock would walk away from the seat he has held since 1997.

But the 68-year-old has vowed to stand again, despite major heart operations and spending time in a mental health unit. 

He told BBC News: 'I'm going to stand for sure, I've made this decision because my health is so much better and I think I owe it to a lot of people who have supported me.

'Once you've been an MP for as long as I have it's hard to just walk away.

'I think if enough people realise that I'm like everyone, I'm a fallible human being who made a mistake but paid a very high price for it... I think I could [win].'

It pitches him against Lib Dem candidate Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who faces a challenge from the Tories and Ukip. 

Mr Hancock was first elected as an SDP MP in the city in a by-election in 1984, but he lost the seat to the Tories in 1987. He was elected as a Lib Dem a decade later

In June last year Mr Hancock gave an 'unreserved' apology at London's High Court over an 'inappropriate and unprofessional friendship' with a single mother known as Annie, who had sought his assistance as her MP and local councillor.

Solicitors for the woman said the apology was part of a 'confidential settlement' in which the 'vulnerable woman', who suffers from mental health problems, brought a claim for damages against him. 

Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had previously called on Mr Hancock to resign his membership and said he had 'no future' in the party. 

He was first elected as an SDP MP in the city in a by-election  in 1984, but he lost the seat to the Tories in 1987. He was elected as a Lib Dem a decade later. 

Ekaterina Zatuliveter, accused of being a Russia spy, had a four-year affair with Mr Hancock

■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat.

■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’

■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. 

■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann, a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. 

Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’

■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. 

'He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’
