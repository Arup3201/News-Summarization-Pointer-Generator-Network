Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 600,000 in Britain

A revolutionary eye implant inspired by the Hubble Space Telescope could help more than half a million people suffering from a previously incurable condition that leads to blindness.

The device – a mini telescope comprised of two lenses – treats age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which affects 600,000 in Britain, mainly the elderly.

The disease targets a part of the retina called the macula, the 5mm spot at the back of the eye packed with light-receptive cells. It often becomes diseased with age,  leading to central vision becoming distorted and blurred.

There is no cure and about half of patients are so badly affected they are registered blind.

However, a London eye surgeon and an optical physicist have come up with a new solution – inspired by a famous flaw with the Hubble probe.

Eye surgeon Bobby Qureshi said: ‘There have been telescopic implants for AMD for a couple of years, but getting the optics right has been extremely problematic.

‘The lenses are so strong that focusing images has been difficult, and the results for patients have been hit and miss.’

The scientists then remembered the problems surrounding the Hubble telescope. ‘After Hubble was put into orbit in 1990 the images that came back were fuzzy,’ Mr Qureshi said. Scientists eventually solved the problem: the edges of the 8ft-wide mirror were two-thousandths of a millimetre too flat.

The solution – called ‘adaptive optics’ – was to add extra mirrors to compensate for the flaw.

Using this technique, Mr Qureshi, of the London Eye Hospital, and Professor Pablo Artal, of Murcia University, in Spain, have designed a ‘mini telescope’ to be inserted surgically into the eye.

Called the iolAMD, it is comprised of two lenses 2mm apart, and magnifies images, as well as directing the centre of the image away from diseased parts of the macula and on to healthy sections. Combined, these effects enable the patient to see clearly again.

The new lenses come with a hefty price tag – £6,000 per eye – but Mr Qureshi believes the cost could fall to £500, at which point the NHS may start to fund it.

He said: ‘I would like to see it on the NHS by 2017, because it will transform the treatment of people with end-stage AMD.’

He added the lenses were not a cure, as they did not stop the macula from deteriorating.
