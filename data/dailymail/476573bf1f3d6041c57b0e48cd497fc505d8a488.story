Rape allegations against Bill Cosby came back to haunt the comedian once again on Monday when a supposedly harmless social media stunt blew up in his face.

And Barbara Bowman, 47, the brave victim of the comedian's twisted sexual abuse, tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview, 'I do not find rape funny, but I do not ridicule others for their expression. Bill Cosby's self induced #cosbymeme was a safe outlet for many to do so.'

Cosby posted an invitation on Twitter on Monday afternoon asking fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him.

The comedian's intention was no doubt for fans to post lightly humorous posts like the 'Happy Monday!' example in his original tweet, but instead fans focused on a series of rape allegations that have been levelled at him.

'I was drugged and raped by that man,' Barbara revealed.

'The Cosby meme-ing was a sight to see,' she told MailOnline. 'I'm grateful that the critical masses are now paying attention to, and are taking seriously, the reality and truth about Bill Cosby and his evil deeds.

'Rape is nothing to joke about, but Twitter has been used as a vessel for communication of the highest magnitude and has been used as an outlet for people to express their disgust with the rapist.'

Barbara said that although Bill Cosby had not been prosecuted, the public reaction agaisnt him was clear.

'However, he now must endure the scorn and humiliation that came to pass as a result of his invitation to the public to express their feelings about him using Twitter as an outlet. 

'It should be very clear to him now that people loathe rapists, and a large majority had to get their anguish of off their chest, even if it meant laughing at his narcissism, sickness and foolishness.'

Following the backlash Cosby's original tweet was deleted and the meme generator was removed from the site. The link now redirects people to Cosby's homepage.

However the memes have been widely repeated on other sites and social networking.

Cosby, best known for his role as Dr Heathcliff Huxtable in the The Cosby Show, has however never been  charged with rape in court.

Last month, stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a live performance.

'Bill Cosby has the f***ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,' Buress declared from the stage at the Trocadero Theater in Cosby's hometown of Philadelphia.

Buress said: '''Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.' Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.'

In her interview with MailOnline, Barbara did not hold back.

'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.'

Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels.

Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too.

After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her. 

In 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004.

It was at that trial that 13 women came forward to allege they too were drugged and sexually abused by Cosby.  

Cosby has not commented on any of the allegations since they have resurfaced.
