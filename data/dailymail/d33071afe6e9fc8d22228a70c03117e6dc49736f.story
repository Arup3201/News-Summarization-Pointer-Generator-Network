10-time World Series of Poker title holder Phil Ivey denies what he did to win almost $22million at baccarat in Atlantic City and London.

In an interview that will be broadcast on CBS 60 Minutes Sports Tuesday, Ivey denies he was cheating when the casino granted him special accommodations they chalked up to superstition.

'I'm viewing the casino as my opponent,' he said. 'It's my job to try to exploit weaknesses in the house and try to give myself the best opportunity to win.'

Winner: Phil Ivey, who has won 10 World Series of Poker titles, is being sued by two casinos

The Borgata in Atlantic City and Crockfords in London both claim what Ivey did to win millions of dollars from them in 2012 is cheating.

According to Ivey, both casinos agreed to certain conditions before Ivey sat down with a few million dollars to play.

The player asked for a specific brand of playing cards, a shuffling machine, an Asian dealer and stipulated that the same card decks be used.

The conditions helped Ivey use 'edge sorting' to exploit printing errors on the backs of playing cards that offset designs too far to one or the other side. 

Ivey's partner, Cheung Yin Sun, was with him at the baccarat table and instructed the dealer in Mandarin to rotate 'good cards' and 'bad cards' in specific ways before discarding them after a hand.

The sorting machine maintained the positioning of these cards, Ivey explains, allowing him to know whether a 'good' or 'bad' card was coming based on small design imperfections.

In court filings, casino officials say they believed Ivey's requests were just superstition and not aimed at changing the odds of the game in his favor. 

The Borgata is suing Ivey to recover the $9.6million the player won, while Ivey is suing Crockfords for nearly $12 million after the London casino refused to pay. 

Officials with The Borgata and Crockfords didn't participate in the television interview because the companies don't comment on pending litigation.

'Some people believe that it was cheating,' Ivey said. 'I know it wasn't. The professional gamblers know it's not. I wouldn't do anything close to cheating. I mean, my reputation is everything in gambling.'

Sun and two companions are also suing Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut for withholding money won using a similar 'edge sorting' tactic. 

Bluff Magazine records Ivey's lifetime poker tournament winnings to be just shy of $20million. In July, Ivey won his tenth World Series of Poker bracelet.
