Nathaniel Clyne has vowed to take his England chance and keep Glen Johnson out of Roy Hodgson’s plans.

Clyne, 23, is on the cusp of winning his first senior international cap after a sparkling start to the campaign.

He was called up ahead of Liverpool’s Johnson, 30, who has 54 England caps.

Asked if that was a big boost, Clyne replied: 'Definitely. It shows that I’m getting credited for the good performances I’ve been putting on. I’ve been given my chance now and I’m going to make it count.

'I’m ready for any game if it’s against Slovenia or Scotland. There are a lot of younger players pushing to get in the team and it’s always good to have young legs to run around.'

Clyne joins his former Southampton team-mate Calum Chambers in the England set-up with perhaps a greater claim to starting against Slovenia in the Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday. Southampton are four places and eight points above Arsenal.

'I think I’ve settled in well and I’m looking forward to playing,’ said Clyne. 'It’s good to have the competition (with Chambers). It keeps you on your toes. We get the best out of each other.'

Clyne believes Southampton, currently second in the Premier League, can maintain their place in the top four and qualify for the Champions League.

'We’re on a good run of form at the moment and we keep on winning,’ he said. 'The spirit is high. We’re playing good football. I don’t think we’ve gone off after a game and thought: "We’ve got lucky there".'
