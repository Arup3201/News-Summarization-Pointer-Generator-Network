A couple who have visited the same Jersey hotel 90 times are being rewarded with 1960s-style bill charging them just £3.60 a day each for what would be a £2,000 holiday.

Loyal customers Francis and Margaret Brierley are celebrating their 90th visit to the Dolan Group's hotels having first met on the island in 1965.

Half a century on, the hotel's owner invited the West Midlands couple to stay 10 nights and dine in the silver service restaurant for just £72 - an impressive 92 per cent discount from the £1,920 cost.

Mr Brierley, a retired lorry driver and milkman, known to friends as Harry, was delighted at the gesture and was shocked at the offer.

The 79-year-old said: 'We're so thrilled to be asked by the owner Bill Dolan, it's such a generous offer - it's a bloody great big saving.

'I first met Margaret when she was here with her sister in 1965, after three years of courting we finally got together and have been in love ever since.

'The memories we have here are irreplaceable and hopefully we can have many more together.

'Staff here have become like family to us, we have friends on the island and can't wait to go exploring, shopping and just relax every time we come - that's why we're here at least twice a year.

'Just give me three cups of coffee in the morning and I'm yours to do anything.'

Mrs Brierley, 74, first went to the island with her family as a summer retreat that was close to home.

And although the couple have travelled around the world and still enjoy the sunny coastlines of Mediterranean countries, they insist that nothing compares to Jersey's shore.

Mrs Brierley said: 'We didn't expect anything like this, I'm still in shock of the offer. Each time we go to Spain or Portugal we do look forward to going back to Jersey - nothing compares to their beaches.

The tariff from 1970, but the couple return with a 92 per cent discount from the £1,920 cost today

'It only takes 45 minutes on the plane from Southampton so it's not too long in the air for us. When we arrive we can drive around and although it's changed a lot since the 60s it's definitely not put us off coming back.'

The couple, from Aldridge, West Midlands, have been going to the Channel Islands together since 1969 and have always stayed at the Dolan Group's four star Hotel Cristina or Somerville Hotel.

Company chairman Mr Dolan said: 'We are absolutely delighted that Francis and Margaret have chosen to come back to our hotels year on year.

'Their loyalty to us has never wavered and we thought it was a great opportunity to do something for them in return.

'We thought it would be lovely to take them back to their first visit and charge them only what they paid back in 1969.'
