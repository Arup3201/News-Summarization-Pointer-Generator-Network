The jury found Jodi Arias eligible for the death penalty today following her murder conviction for killing her lover.

Jurors reached their decision on Wednesday just hours after the prosecutor went through stab wound by stab wound that she inflicted on Travis Alexander during the prolonged killing.

Last week she was found guilty of the premeditated, first-degree murder of Alexander after stabbing him more than 27 times, slicing his throat and shooting him in the bathroom of his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008.

The decision came after a day of testimony in the 'aggravation' phase of the trial, during which prosecutor Juan Martinez hoped to prove the 2008 killing was committed in an especially cruel and heinous manner.

Alexander's two sisters sobbed as the medical examiner explained how each of the stab wounds caused tangible pain.

The trial moves into the final phase on Thursday, in which prosecutors will call Alexander's family and other witnesses in an effort to convince the panel Arias should face the ultimate punishment.

Arias' attorneys also will call witnesses, likely members of her family, in an attempt to gain sympathy from jurors so they give her life in prison.

Today's aggravation proceedings were intended to start on Thursday but Arias was put in a psychiatric hold and under suicide watch after telling a local news station that she would rather receive the death penalty as opposed to life in prison because she expects that she will live a long time.

The jury had to decide whether the 
convicted murderer will spend the rest of her days behind bars, or if 
she could be sentenced to death.

That
is determined by the nature of the crime, meaning that they have to 
decide if it was an especially cruel, heinous and depraved killing and 
if so, then they may sentence her to death.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez took the floor first on Wednesday, describing how the angles at which she stabbed Alexander as he lay on the floor of his bathroom shows that she was standing above him.

'We know that he was alive in the sense he could see, breath and hear what was coming,' Martinez said.

'Mr Alexander suffered pain every time that blade entered his body.

'She made sure of it, by stabbing him over and over again...then finishing him off across the throat.'

He talked about how at one point during the attack, Alexander tried to defend himself and she came at him from behind. While that would have come as a surprise in certain circumstances, Alexander was trying to stand up by the sink and would have seen her coming in the mirror.

The courtroom was shown pictures of Alexander's bloody body, zoomed in on the wounds on his back and the back of his head.

Relatives of Mr Alexander were seen openly weeping, covering their faces and looking down when the graphic photos were shown.

Even Arias started crying, covering her face and swiveling her chair to turn away from the screen.

Her fate: Since she was found guilty last Wednesday, Arias said that she would rather be sentenced to death instead of receiving life in prison, and as a result she was on suicide watch for the past week

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi spoke briefly about the need for the jury to focus solely on whether the murder was an 'especially heinous' one.

Martinez called his first witness, Medical examiner Kevin Horn, who went through the various wounds.

He said that an examination of Alexander's head showed 'triangular pieces of the skull that have been gouged out by the knife.'

He went on to say that it was his belief that Alexander was still alive when he was being stabbed in the back of the head, stabbed in his back, and when his throat was slit.

One of the most jarring portions of Wednesday's testimony came when nothing was said at all: in an effort to prove that the attack- that is thought to have taken just over two minutes- was not as short as it sounds, Martinez told the court to sit silently for that time and think about how it would feel if you were being attacked continuously.

Alexander's siblings were seen crying, their shoulders shaking, throughout.

Reliving it: Pictures of the stab wounds on Travis' back were shown to the court which was too much for his relatives to take. Arias even turned away at different points

Arias' state-appointed defense attorney Nurmi said that jurors need to remove the emotion from their decision, specifically mentioning the two-minutes of silence.Â 

'Your duty as jurors is to detach yourself from that emotion, from that passion,' he said in his closing arguments.

Since the jury already knows that Arias murdered Alexander, the biggest legal hurdle for Martinez is to convince them that either the victim suffered pain, and that the attacker knew that she was inflicting pain.

As part of that, Martinez repeatedly referred to the story that Arias said during her lengthy testimony during the original trial when she said that after being arrested she planned on killing herself but decided against it when she pricked her finger with a razor and stopped because 'it stung'.

'Travis Alexander didn't have that choice,' Martinez said.

'Every time that blade cut into him it hurt him. This was not a sting.'
