Following in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, Alec Baldwin, Bryan Adams and Prince, Mike Tyson is the latest in a long line of 
male celebrities to rave about the health benefits of going vegan.

After turning over a new leaf and committing to the strict plant-based diet last year, the former heavyweight champ lost 100 pounds.

'Becoming a vegan gave me another opportunity to live a healthy life,' Tyson told ABC.

'I was so congested from all the drugs and bad cocaine, I could hardly 
breathe'.

But Tyson's health 
overhaul seemed to be as much about clean living as clean eating. He told The Today Show that he adopted the diet after 'too many 
prison cells, too many jails, too many lawsuits, too many bankruptcies, 
too many women, too many venereal diseases, too many everything. Iâ€™m going to live a different life.'

And Google Trends reported that interest in 
veganism is at an all-time high. Food Business News writes that
consumers have swapped red meat for poultry or 
limited red meat in their diets for financial or health reasons.

A new 
survey from market research firm Packaged Facts shows that 12per cent of
U.S. adults 'strongly agree' and 19per cent 'somewhat agree' that they 
are eating many meatless/vegetarian meals.

Former president Bill Clinton was one of the first high-profile public figures to do a 180-degree turn from omnivore to plant-eater. He made 
headlines in 2011 after a second heart health scare prompted him 
to replace beef with broccoli.

'A vegan diet saved my life,' he 
said at the time, adding that he was enjoying eating veggies, fruits and 
beans and didn't miss fast food.

Clinton's healthier eating was an inspiration to Reverend Al Sharpton, who also cut out meat and lost 50 pounds.

Alec Baldwin stopped eating meat and narrated a video for Peta called 'Meet Your Meat' in 2009. After he was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, Baldwin was also inspired to eliminate sugar and dairy from his diet - and rocked the red carpet looking years younger.

'I gave up sugar,' he said. 'I lost 30 pounds in a month. It was amazing.'

He credits his wife, 28-year-old yoga instructor Hilaria, with helping him achieve a healthier lifestyle. A lifelong vegetarian, she hasn't touched dairy since 2000. The couple's wedding cake was even gluten and dairy-free.
