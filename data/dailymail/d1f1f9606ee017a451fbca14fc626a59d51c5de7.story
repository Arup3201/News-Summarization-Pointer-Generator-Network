Matt Lauer 'surfed' to work this morning, going tit for tat with Good Morning America host George Stephanopoulos who yesterday picked up guest anchor Oprah Winfrey with her hair in curlers and drove her to the studio.

As the Today Show went to air, Savannah Guthrie declared 'I have to say this is a very unusual way to start the show, there is no Matt. But apparently he is on his way.'

They then cut to a sharply edited one-and-a-half minute clip of Lauer, dressed in a full suit, riding a motorised surfboard down 49th street.

Stunt: Matt Lauer 'surfed' to work down 49th St in New York

The anchor grabs a hot drink as he glides past a coffee stand and nabs a newspaper off a fellow New Yorker before exclaiming 'the waves on Madison were huge,' as he finally gets to the studio and takes his seat in front of the camera.

The surfing stunt comes just a day after Winfrey, filling in for Robin Roberts, was collected in an SUV by Stephanopoulos and wife, Ali Wentworth.

Spencer was still in her pajamas and Oprah had curlers in her hair as they sifted through garbage in the back of Stephanopoulos' car to make room, all the while being filmed for the show.

Winfrey is one of a number of celebrity guest hosts covering for Roberts while she is on leave recovering from a bone marrow transplant.

The novelty arrivals come as GMA outperformed NBC's Today in the ratings stakes for the 10th week running.

The ABC News morning show won out by 390,000 viewers in total and 217,000 viewers aged between 25-54.

Lauer's surfing was the brainchild of
viral video artists James Percelay and Michael Krivicka whose company 
ThinkModo created a similar film to promote the movie 'Chasing 
Mavericks.'

The anchor later interviewed the men about their video, which showed two surfers in wet suits gliding down New York City streets on motorised surfboards.

While Winfrey was manning the anchor desk, Roberts called in to the GMA studio for the first time since being off sick.

She discussed her recovery and said she sometimes 'can't get [her] head off the pillow.'

But the 51-year-old ensured her co-anchors and the audience that she is feeling better.

'I canâ€™t wait to come back. I want to be back on that couch,' she said. 'You have lifted my spirits. You've got me on my feet. You've got me dancing.'
