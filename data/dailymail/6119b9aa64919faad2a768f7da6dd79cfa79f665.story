'Piles and piles' of bodies were left at a mosque in South Sudan after gunmen killed 200 civilians and wounded 400 others, a top United Nations official has said.

Many victims of the ethnically-targeted massacre in the provincial capital Bentiu were children and the elderly, according to a damning report.

UN humanitarian official Toby Lanzer added the killings last week were 'possibly a game-changer' in the four-month conflict and disturbing echoes of the Rwandan genocide had emerged.

It is claimed rebels have used radio broadcasts to incite men to rape women of different ethnic backgrounds - similarly to the run-up to the 1994 genocide in which up to a million died.

Fleeing the violence: Men, women and children are fleeing the state capital of Bentiu in South Sudan after rebel gunmen reportedly burst into a mosque last week, killing 200 people and leaving 'piles and piles' of bodies

Game-changer: People fleeing near Bentiu. It is claimed messages have been broadcast over the radio inciting men to rape women from different ethnic backgrounds in a disturbing echo of the Rwandan genocide

'It's the first time we're aware of that a
 local radio station was broadcasting hate messages encouraging people 
to engage in atrocities,' said Mr Lanzer, the top humanitarian official in South Sudan.

'That really accelerates 
South Sudan's descent into an even more difficult situation from which 
it needs to extract itself.'

Human rights investigators said hundreds of civilians were killed between April 15 and 17 when rebel forces seized Bentiu, the oil-rich capital of Unity state.

The oil fields are crucial to both sides because South Sudan, the world's youngest country which only formed in 2011, gains 90 per cent of all its income from oil sales.

Reports said the rebel forces were Nuer people from the Sudan People's Liberation Army, who count ousted former vice president Riek Machar among their number.

The UN said they targeted non-Nuer citizens for their ethnicity - claims the rebels denied.

Rebel fighter Brig Lul Ruai Koang told the BBC government allies could have engineered the slaughter as a PR exercise, saying: 'Our forces are not responsible for killing civilians anywhere in Bentiu.'

Full to bursting: More than 25,000 civilians have fled to the UN camp in Bentiu, where there is just a litre of water per person per day and one toilet per 350 people. Officials warn people will die within days

Leaving: A woman carries her belongings as she flees from renewed attacks in Bentiu. The UN said there have been 'widespread human rights violations committed by both sides, not only in Bentiu, but in all areas'

The world's youngest country gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after being blighted for decades by ethnic violence.

But tensions rose in July last year when President Salva Kiir dismissed members of his own government, including vice president Riek Machar.

An argument began in the capital Juba on December 15 between soldiers loyal to the President - one of the Dinka people - and his ousted deputy, one of the Nuer people.

It soon spread to full-blown fighting and similar violence erupted elsewhere as the President accused Machar of attempting a coup.

But the UN said there have been 'widespread human rights violations committed by both sides, not only in Bentiu, but in all areas affected by the ongoing conflict.'

Survivors of last week's massacre claimed they were told that entering the mosque would mean they were safe.

But once inside they were robbed of money and mobile phones before all non-Nuer people were mercilessly gunned down, with children and the elderly not spared from the violence.

Mr
 Gorgeu said his team members in Bentiu, including 12 international 
staff, have treated more than 200 people wounded in the violence, 
including many gunshot victims.

British
 Ambassador Ian Hughes said the killings were a clear 
violation of international law and those behind the atrocities will be held to account.

He extended that warning to those inciting violence over the radio.

The UN report said: 'While some opposition commanders did broadcast messages calling for unity and an end to tribalism, others broadcast hate messages declaring that certain ethnic groups should not stay in Bentiu and even calling on men from one community to commit vengeful sexual violence against women from another community.'

Slaughter: Two bodies on the road near Bentiu. Survivors of the mosque attack said they were assured they would be safe before being robbed of money and mobile phones and mercilessly gunned down

Civil war: Bodies near Bentiu. The conflict began in December after the President Salva Kiir, one of the Dinki people, dismissed several colleagues including his vice president, who is from the rival Nuer ethnic group

A million people have fled their homes since the civil war broke out in mid-December.

Thousands of civilians from several ethnic groups have streamed to the UN peacekeeping base in Bentiu over the last week because many believe more violence is coming.

The base now holds 25,000 people but has just a litre of water per person per day and only one toilet per 350 people.

Mr Lanzer said: The risk of a public health crisis inside our base is enormous.'

Raphael Gorgeu, the head of Doctors Without Borders in South Sudan, said people will die inside the UN base in coming days because of the poor sanitation and lack of water.

The fighting also means tens of thousands of farmers have abandoned their crops.

That means there is a severe risk of famine later this year because civilians would normally be planting in April and May, Mr Lanzer said.

The UN has not spelled out clearly who exactly the victims were last week, but because ethnic Nuers carried out the killings it is likely that ethnic Dinkas were among the dead.

The UN also said former residents of the Darfur region of Sudan were among those killed. Nuer residents who refused to take part in the attacks were also killed.

Though thousands of people are cramming into the UN base in search of shelter, they may not even be safe there.

Last week an angry mob attacked a UN base in Bor and killed about 60 people. In that case, ethnic Nuers sheltering inside bore the brunt of the attack.

Mr Gorgeu said such a potential attack is a major concern for the safety of his staff but that he cannot abandon the civilians in need.

He said: 'All this violence, if you look at Bor, if you look at Bentiu, it's a major, major concern. We can see the level of violence is having an unacceptably high cost on the civilian population and this must be addressed.'
