Manchester City will be without new signing Eliaquim Mangala for the trip to Newcastle United on Sunday.

The French centre-back signed for the club in a £32m deal this summer but he has not had sufficient training with his new team to be passed ready to play by manager Manuel Pellegrini.

Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Pellegrini said: 'Just Alvaro Negredo is injured. Mangala needs to work more with the team, he will not play this weekend.'

City were beaten 3-0 in last week's final test before the start of the season, as Arsenal humbled the champions in the Community Shield.

Pellegrini has also lead his team in the US, and spoke about their pre-season so far.

'I'm not 'happy-happy' because we need more days to train as some arrived late. It was important they had a good rest after WC but we will see how we do. 

'We had a good pre-season with the rest of the squad.'

Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Mangala are three of the major signings for the club this summer, as well as the surprise loan move for former Chelsea legend Frank Lampard.

And asked about more transfers, Pellegrini said he was happy with his squad, and hopes they can avoid a poor start to the season starting at St James' Park. 

'We will see between now and the end of the window. We have important restrictions over number of players we can have in our squad. I think that for the moment the squad is ready.

'We must improve first part of the season as it was very bad when we were playing away from home in the early games.'

Lastly, on Sergio Aguero, Pellegrini couldn't hide his delight in securing the Argentine for five more years at the Etihad Stadium. 

 I think that always this team needs Sergio Aguero. It's important he has a pre-season, he has had so many months not playing normally so we have a mix of players that can play.
