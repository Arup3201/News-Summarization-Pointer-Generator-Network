A young couple were given a bizarre early-morning wake up call when a sealed can of baked beans suddenly exploded in their kitchen.

Ben Leo and his girlfriend Rhian Wade said they thought a bomb had gone off when they woke to the sudden noise at 3am in the morning.

But they were left confused after a late-night search last Saturday failed to find the source of the loud bang.

The can of baked beans, bought from supermarket Lidl, suddenly exploded in the cupboard of Worthing's Ben Leo and Rhian Wade

After going back to sleep, Mr Leo went to make a meal the next day and found the exploded tin of baked beans, bought from Lidl, in their kitchen cupboard.

Mr Leo, 24, from Worthing, West Sussex, said: 'We had no idea what it was and at 3am we were very confused and tired.

'It sounded like a small bomb had gone off in the house somewhere. The next day I went to make some lunch and opened the cupboard to find the beans everywhere.

'The can had somehow expanded and blown its top. Instead of having beans on toast for lunch I had to clean them up.'

Mr Leo said the tin was still in date and had only just been bought from a nearby store.

The couple said they thought a bomb had gone off due to the loud bang created when the baked bean can exploded

Lidl say they have strict quality controls in place and will be contacting their supplier to investigate the explosion

He told of his fears he could have been 'seriously injured' if the beans had not been in the cupboard.

He said: 'It's pretty scary to think what could have happened if I had been looking through the cupboard when the tin exploded.

'The tin is extremely sharp and it could have left me badly cut or severely bruised - I could have been seriously injured. You wouldn't have expected this from something as innocent as a tin of baked beans.

'But thankfully we are both safe and we'll definitely think twice about where we buy our baked beans from now.'

Budget supermarket Lidl has moved to assure other customers and says it will launch an investigation into the explosion.

A spokesman said: 'We have strict quality control processes in place with our suppliers and, as such, take these matters extremely seriously.

'We would ask that the packaging is returned to us so that we may begin all relevant investigations into this, along with our supplier.'
