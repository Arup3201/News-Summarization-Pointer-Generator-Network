University of Florida freshman quarterback Treon Harris has been reinstated to his team after the female student who accused him of sexual assault dropped her claim.

The 19-year-old true freshman was accused of assaulting an unidentified peer in a campus dorm last Saturday night - just hours after leading the Gators to victory at the University of Tennessee.

Harris' attorney, Huntley Johnson, released a statement to local media earlier stating that the woman who accused Harris withdrew her complaint:

Accusations: Harris was accused of assaulting an unidentified female student in a campus dorm in the early hours of Sunday morning. Those claims have since been dropped

According to the Gainesville university campus' crime log, the only incident of sexual battery this week happened at the Springs Residential complex and was reported on Monday.

No charges were ever filed in the case and Harris was not even arrested. Nonetheless, has since taken his Twitter profile down. 

Earlier in the week Florida head coach Will Muschamp postponed his regular Monday press conference in light of the charges, and the university confirmed the report in a written statement.

'We have no tolerance for sexual assault on our campus,' UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement released by the school.

'The university is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for every member of the UF community. We must strive to protect all of our students from sexual harassment and assault, and do everything in our power to promote a safe learning environment,' he added. 

The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Harris replaced starting quarterback Jeff Drisken in the lineup for the game against Tennessee, and helped lead the team to a 10-9 victory. 

Harris made his debut with the Gators in the September 6 blowout against Eastern Michigan University.

He graduated from Booker T Washington High School in Miami, where he helped lead the squad to a Class 4A championship in 2012 and 2013.

The dropping of these latest charges come after revelations this weekend that the investigation into a similar-sounding sexual assault by quarterback Jameis Winston, was deliberately botched by Tallahassee Police and Florida State Universtiy Officials.  

Heisman Trophy-winner Winston was able to continue playing because formal charges were never filed.
