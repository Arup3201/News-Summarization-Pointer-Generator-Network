A school tutor who is tasked with improving the behaviour of pupils has been caught on camera feeding a wild rat by the school kitchens.

Paul Ashworth is now being investigated by the school for his own behaviour after parents complained after a video of the incident was posted on Facebook.

The 33-year-old is a student support co-ordinator at Springwell Community College and runs the behaviour improvement programme. He was filmed laughing as the foot long rodent scurried from bushes to nibble bread that was left out.

Pest control experts were called in to the 900 pupil school near Chesterfield after fears that the pregnant rat could start an infestation.

A furious parent reported the incident to the school after seeing the video on the social networking site and an investigation has been launched.

Mandy Sludds, told The Sun: ‘For staff to encourage wild rats not far from where children are eating and playing is just diabolical.

'This was stupid, mindless behaviour from an adult in charge of sorting out children behaving badly.

'The bread had been put out for the rat not far from the kitchen block. It was a big, pregnant thing with a nest under a bush.'

The footage was filmed by a female student on her mobile phone and shows the rat as it ran in and out of its nest to grab the food, the girl was then allegedly warned by Ashworth and his two colleagues not to show the video to anyone.

Ms Sludds, from Staveley in Derbyshire, added: 'It was particularly bad because the school has only been up a couple of years, but the old building on the site had a real rat problem.'

Ms Sludds’ children, Shannon, 15, and Reece, 12, plus a friend stayed off school for a day in protest of the incident.

In the film, one of the men calls out: 'Come on you little sod. It's obviously a clever rat.' Ashworth is then heard saying: ‘Fresh meat.’

He refused to comment, saying: ‘It's being dealt with by my line manager.'

Acting head Tracey Burnside confirmed pest controllers were called to put down rat traps.

She said in The Sun: 'Clearly staff should not put out food for any animals on school grounds.

'We understand that the bread was on the ground near the rat for a short period of time but have launched an investigation.'
