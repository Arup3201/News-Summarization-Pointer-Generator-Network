One hockey player literally had his eye glued to the ball in a NHL game last night.

Video footage caught the moment the puck flew towards Patrik Nemeth of the Dallas Stars and wedged under his visor.

The 23-year-old slid back towards the barrier at the American Airlines Center in Texas before pulling his glove off to remove the hard rubber disk from his helmet.

Freak accident: One hockey player literally had his eye glued to the ball in a NHL game last night

Caught on camera: Video footage caught the moment the puck flew towards Patrik Nemeth of the Dallas Stars and wedged under his visor

A Fox Sports commentator likened 6ft 3in Nemeth to a 'pirate' with a patch over his eye. 

Once the defenseman pulled the puck away he cracked a smile signaling he was okay.

However, his eye did appear to be slightly bruised.

Spectators were seen looking on at the scene with speechless expressions planted on their faces.

The one-in-a-million shot was delivered by Calgary Flames forward, Jiri Hudler.

There was more bad luck flying Nemeth's way, as the Dallas Stars ended up losing to the opposition 3-5.
