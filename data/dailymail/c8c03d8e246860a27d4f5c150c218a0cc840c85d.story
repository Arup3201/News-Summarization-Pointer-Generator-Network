Tesco's has recalled its No Added Sugar Double Concentrate Apple and Blackcurrent juice amid claims that it has caused vomiting and diarrhea and contained 'foreign bodies'

Tesco's has recalled a popular children's fruit drink amid claims that it has caused vomiting and diarrhea and contained 'foreign bodies'.

The troubled chain has stopped selling its No Added Sugar Double Concentrate Apple and Blackcurrent juice in both the 750ml and 1.5l. 

Talk about the recall on the HotUKDeals website led to parenting website Playpennies making their own inquiries, 'to ease the worries of our audience and other parents', site manager Karen McGinn said.

According to the website it called Tesco's customer service line where the company 'refused to confirm reports appearing online from parents that the juice has been causing vomiting'.

Playpennies told its users: 'They would only confirm that foreign bodies have been found in some batches, which along with an unusual smell have led to all returned bottles being sent to laboratories as soon as possible to try and identify any potential issues and the batches that may be affected.'

The remarks on their website caused a flurry of comments from their users. Several users had noticed the drink had not smelt right, while others said they felt sick after drinking it.  

Tesco's confirmed the chain had received complaints which it is now 'investigating with the supplier'; a spokesperson said the products had been withdrawn from sale and advised any customer not 'satisfied' with the product to return it to any store

A user on the Playpennies website said her two children were off school sick today having consumed the concentrate fruit drink yesterday

Playpennies user Viks8 wrote that she had noticed the drink smelt 'disgusting' and had returned it

Withdrawn from sale: Tesco has since taken the product off the shelves

Playpennies user Viks8 wrote: 'I took two bottles of this back to Tesco's early last week as the smell was disgusting 2 days later we bouggt (sic) another bottle which was exactly the same very disgusting I have since been in Tescos and they were all out of stock'

2,000 Tesco's workers have been told their jobs are at risk and 43 stores face closure. 

£2 billion was wiped from Tesco's market value last month after the chain plunged deeper into a financial crisis.

It announced its annual profits may be £550 million lower than expected.

The Serious Fraud Office is investigating whether it inflated profits by £263m over several years.

The company suspended eight of its most senior executives amid the allegations.

Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent stepped down.  

Millions of customers have switched to budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer because Tesco has failed to deliver on price, service or quality.

MrsD32 wrote: 'We finished a bottle of this yesterday and opened a new one last night. My eldest 2 children are off school today, one with diarrhoea (sic) and the other was sick all night. I hope this is a coincidence Tesco but it's not looking very likely! Shape up! 

And user Ruby2shoes wrote: 'My son drinks this an he's been sick so much this month I did not put the two together!! He's autistic an (sic) doesn't like being sick this had made my month so difficult thanks!!' 

A Tesco spokesperson confirmed the chain had received complaints which it is now 'investigating with the supplier'.

The spokesperson said the products had been withdrawn from sale and advised any customer not 'satisfied' with the product to return it to any store. 

The Tesco website lists the product as being 'currently not available'.  

The spokesperson refused to discuss what the complaints were about or comment on whether they believed the drink may have caused people to be sick. They also declined to comment on any tests they were doing on the drink, or when those results would be available.
