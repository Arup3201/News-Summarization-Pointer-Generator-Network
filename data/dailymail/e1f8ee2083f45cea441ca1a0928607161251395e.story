With Crystal Palace in the Premier League relegation zone and in the worst form slump of any of the 20 top-flight clubs, Alan Pardew will have to get cracking the moment his appointment as the new manager is officially announced. 

Here are some of the issues that need urgent attention.

RESTORE DEFENSIVE MEANNESS

Crystal Palace's success in the last couple of seasons has been based on being solid at the back. Under Tony Pulis, they conceded only five goals in nine matches (0.55 goals per game) during the run that secured their Premier League status. This season they conceded 30 goals in 18 games (1.6 per game) with Neil Warnock in charge and their organisation and confidence looked shot before caretaker Keith Millen led them to a clean sheet at QPR on Sunday. Luckily for Palace, Pardew is of the school that being hard to beat is the first priority, and you can build from there.

RIGHT RECRUITMENT

Palace need a consistent goalscorer, their main summer signing Fraizer Campbell has netted only three times so far this season. Bafetimbi Gomis was on Warnock's radar and he would be the type to interest Pardew too – a creator and scorer or goals, and exciting to watch. Whether Swansea would let him go to a Premier League rival in January when Wilfried Bony is away at the African Cup of Nations is debatable but something needs to be done. Palace have also struggled in the full-back positions so expect a couple of acquisitions there.

UNLOCK THE KEY TO WILFRIED ZAHA AND DWIGHT GAYLE

Pardew was a big fan of Zaha when he was manager of Newcastle but couldn't persuade Mike Ashley to get him on the terms that Manchester United wanted. Zaha has shown glimpses of his talent during his second spell at Selhurst Park but is still not the player who won England recognition towards the end of 2012. Likewise, Gayle is the best natural finisher at the club and one goal in his last eight games is below-par for someone of his talent. Pulis and Warnock didn't trust him as a regular starter but Pardew likes a bit of flamboyance in his forwards and at the age of 24, it is time for Gayle to start delivering.

GLENN MURRAY AND GETTING BACK TO BASICS

The return of Murray from a loan spell from Reading is symbolic, his goals got Palace into the Premier League and they need that togetherness and spirit within the club again. Likewise, long-serving centre-half Paddy McCarthy may be important, he is currently on loan to Sheffield United. For all the money Pardew may get to spend in January, the diehards at the club – Murray, McCarthy, goalkeeper Julian Speroni, defender Damien Delaney and skipper Mile Jedinak are vital. The never-say-die attitude of the dressing-room is the biggest asset Palace have and Pardew's playing links to the club will help with that.

THE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN STEVE PARISH

Parish is on his fifth manager in just over two years, a high churn rate given Palace have been successful on the pitch during that time. Dougie Freedman, Ian Holloway, Tony Pulis and Neil Warnock have come and gone for different reasons, the only common link is Parish appointed and then lost them, suggesting he may be an acquired taste for any manager. He and Pardew have watched games and socialised together in the past and of course Pardew has shown his loyalty to owners before, he never let any frustrations with Mike Ashley at Newcastle spill over into public bad blood. Pardew and his staff have a neat little trick in helping keep the club's chairman and chief executive feel part of things, they send a private email before and after every game, explaining team selection and tactics. It is a sign of respect from Pardew, he shows by doing that he understands he is the manager working for a chairman or owner. It should mean his relationship with Parish is less trained than Pulis's was for example.

GET THE FANS BEHIND THE TEAM

Selhurst Park is one of the most atmospheric grounds in the Premier League, Pulis said where you see chimney pots, you will find real football fans, and there are plenty of chimney pots on the houses in south London. Former player Mark Bright, a close associate of Parish, said the silence of Palace fans during their last home game, a 3-1 home defeat against Southampton, spoke volumes and probably accelerated the need for a managerial change. Anyone who was at Selhurst last season when Palace roared back from 3-0 down against Liverpool to draw 3-3 will know the fans' vocal backing is critical to Palace's survival hopes. Pardew was initially known as Super Al by Palace fans in an ironic way when he played for the club, but his winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final – one of the most famous goals in the club's history – made him a genuine hero overnight.

JONIESTA

Jonathan Williams, 21, is adored by Palace fans and Parish. At Selhurst, he is known as Jonniesta as a nod towards the great Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta. Wales manager Chris Coleman, a former Palace player himself, has been happy to throw Williams into his team with Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey without suffering a drop in standards, but it hasn't worked out for him at Palace yet, with Pulis and Warnock - who both prefer experienced players - sending him on loan to Ipswich. Williams is due to return in the New Year and once he is over a groin injury, Pardew could be the manager to unlock his talents, he has shown at Newcastle with Perez, Dummett and Aarons, he puts faith in younger players. Tireless in midfield, Williams can pass and move with the best of them.
