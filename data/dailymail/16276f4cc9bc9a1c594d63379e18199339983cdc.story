A California woman has embarked on a 24,300-nautical-mile journey with the hope of becoming the youngest woman to ever circumnavigate the globe in a single-engine aircraft - and her name just happens to be the same as another female aviator who famously tried to circle the planet 77 years ago.

Amelia Rose Earhart took off Thursday from Oakland, California, in a single-engine Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft with co-pilot Theddy Spichtig. The pair expects the journey around the globe to take 17 days with stops in 14 different countries. When she is in the air, about 80 percent of her flight will be over water, the majority of which is open ocean.

Amelia, too: Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 as she attempted to become the first woman to fly around the world

As for that other Amelia Earhart - the one who disappeared in the Pacific Ocean while trying to become the first woman to circumnavigate the globe in 1937 - there is no relation. However, Amelia Rose Earhart's family always thought they were distantly related to the famous aviator, and that is who the 31-year-old Amelia Earhart is named after.

About 10 years ago, the contemporary Earhart started taking aviation lessons with the hopes of living up to her famous name and flying around the world. A few years later, Earhart learned she was not related to the famous pilot.

'If you believe anything for 30 years and are told it's not true, it's tough to take,' she told NBC News prior to her flight on Thursday.

But Earhart - who also flies a helicopter for her job as a traffic reporter - still admired her namesake, and vowed to complete a voyage similar to the one that presumably claimed the life of the fearless aviator.

After years of aviation training, Earhart began her journey Thursday from the same Oakland airfield where Amelia Earhart started her doomed voyage nearly 80 years ago.

'When I think about the feelings of opening up the hangar door on the morning of the flight and seeing the same view that Amelia saw, it's really special to me,' she said.

All aspects of the trip aren't the same, of course, and Earhart says that her plane has state-of-the-art equipment that her namesake didn't have the luxury of enjoying during her tragic flight. 

'The reliability of a single-engine aircraft today in 2014 is vastly 
different than it was back in the 1930s,' Earhart told Boston NPR radio 
station 90.9 Wbur's "Here and Now" program. 'So, while there is still a 
component of adventure with any flight over water, I felt most connected
 to the Pilatus. It’s a beautiful aircraft. The cockpit is absolutely 
state-of-the-art -- we’ve got synthetic vision, we’ve got dual GPS.'

Despite the fact that they share no familial ancestors, Earhart says recreating the journey will help her connect with her namesake - and hopefully inspire others.

'By recreating and symbolically completing Amelia Mary Earhart’s flight 
around the world, I hope to develop an even deeper connection to my 
namesake and also encourage the world to pursue their own adventures,' 
the pilot wrote on the website set up to document her trip. 'Amelia 
believed that, ‘adventure is worthwhile in itself’ and it is that type 
of attitude that spurs us to seek the unknown, push our limits and fly 
outside the lines.'

Earhart's journey can be tracked minute-by-minute on her website.
