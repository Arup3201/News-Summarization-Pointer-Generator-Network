Her career has spanned decades, survived fashions and struggled through a variety of public relations disasters.

But last night hundreds of die-hard Madonna fans abandoned their Queen of Pop by marching out of London's Hyde Park during her MDNA concert - some branding it the worst they had ever seen.

Even a sexy striptease on stage left fans cold- one simply stated: 'When Madonna has concerts in her 50s where she strips herself on stage, you know her career is as dead as myspace.'

Shot herself in the foot? Fans branded Madonna's Hyde Park gig the worst concert ever and hundreds walked out

Many fans decided they did not want to stick around to watch the finale as of the poor sound quality, terrible weather and Madonna's failure to perform more of her classic hits.

One reviewer even said at one point Madonna screamed: 'We love you Poland', which if it was a joke fell flat on an already less than enthusiastic audience.

Others said a 10.30pm curfew imposed by Westminster Council meant Madonna was forced to start her performance early, in broad daylight, which meant the elaborate staging was lost to some of the audience.

'Worst gig ever': Even Madonna's energetic performances with a variety of props didn't win round many

Earlier her management admitted it had failed to sell all the tickets for the concert - Madonna's first in England for four years.

It is believed some fans were put off by the £77 for the open air show.

A number of fans later complained on Twitter about the show. One user, Courtney, tweeted: 'Worst gig I have ever seen.'

Dawn Gracie wrote: 'Madonna left early,' adding later: 'I mourn those vintage Madonna days ... where potty mouth and violent imagery wasn't necessary. Just good vibes and great music!'

Claire Whitaker said : 'When Madonna has concerts in her 50s where she strips herself on stage, you know her career is as dead as myspace.'

Kylie Minogue, George Michael, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and U2 star Adam Clayton were among celebrities seen watching the show - which finished just moments before the 10.30pm curfew imposed by Westminster Council.

Her sexy strip took place while she sang Like A Virgin in front of the 50,000-strong crowd.

Madonna, 53, peeled off her clothing to reveal a sheer bra and black lacy thong, which she wore under fishnet tights.

Her toyboy boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, who was on stage as a backing dancer, then helped to fasten a corset around her.

She told the audience: 'I like to live dangerously.'

Madonna also introduced her 11-year-old son Rocco, who joined her as a dancer during the gig.

As well as performing hits like Papa Don't Preach, Hung Up and Vogue, she also showcased tracks from her latest album MDNA.

She made a dig at pop rival Lady Gaga by incorporating her track Born This Way during a rendition of Express Yourself.

Not all fans were disappointed. TV and radio presenter Toby Anstis tweeted : 'I can definitely say, that was THE best live show I have ever seen! Mesmerising from start to finish! Amaaaazin!'

Madonna's press spokeswoman Barbara Charone, was unavailable for comment about the mass walk-out.

A colleague said : 'She is out doing Madonna-related stuff.'
