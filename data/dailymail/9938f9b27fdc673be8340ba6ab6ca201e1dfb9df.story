Liverpool have been handed the most glamorous of Champions League returns after they were drawn in a group with holders Real Madrid.

While Manchester City were drawn in a ‘group of death’ consisting of Bayern Munich, Roma and CSKA Moscow, Brendan Rodgers’ side were pitted against the expensively assembled Galacticos. 

And Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo last night fired an ominous warning to the Anfield club as they prepare to play in the competition for the first time since 2009.

‘I know Liverpool is a very difficult stadium,’ said the former Manchester United winger.

‘But we are Real Madrid.’ Liverpool will also face Champions League debutants PFC Ludogorets of Bulgaria and Swiss side Basle in Group B. But it is the prospect of facing the current holders and 10-time European champions that captures the imagination. 

The Merseysiders will host Carlo Ancelotti’s side on October 22 in what is sure to be an epic night at Anfield before travelling to the Spanish capital on November 4.

The clash at Anfield will rekindle memories of Liverpool’s 4-0 Champions League win over Real in 2009. But speaking at the draw here last night, Ronaldo warned Liverpool fans not to expect a repeat of that memorable night.

‘I was not there,’ Ronaldo said. ‘It’s different. Every game has a different story. Liverpool are different too, so let’s see who’s going to be the best.

‘My reception at Anfield? Wow. If it was at Manchester United it would be amazing. It will be nice for me to face Liverpool, I’ve never played there since I came to Real Madrid.’

Meanwhile, Rodgers admits he can hardly wait for Real’s visit. ‘I’m already thinking of Anfield on that night,’ he said. ‘But there are two other good teams in it along with us.

‘To be back in it again, no matter who we were going to play, it was always going to be exciting. But to have Real Madrid — last season’s champions — in your group is going to be special. It’s a tough group but we’ll really look forward to the challenge of getting out of the group.’
