Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta claims the Premier League champions are now bigger and better than neighbours United.

City’s 1-0 win over United on Sunday was their fourth in a row against their local rivals and as good as ended any title hopes Louis van Gaal’s team may have had.

And after hearing Van Gaal claim before the game that United were still the bigger club, the City right-back was happy to hit back.

Pablo Zabaleta believes his side have overtaken Manchester United as the club's 'main team'

Zabaleta said: ‘All I can say is that City’s players and the owners are making a big effort to be a top team not just in Manchester but also in the Premier League and also in Europe.

‘Probably it’s a different history now than years ago where probably United was the main team in the city. Now it’s a bit different.’

City are still searching for their best form ahead of a crucial Champions League game at home to CSKA Moscow and Zabaleta admitted that City must improve if they are to salvage their Champions League hopes, as well as to hang on to Chelsea’s coattails at the top of the league.

‘It’s another huge game on Wednesday,’ Zabaleta said. ‘We were very unlucky the last time we played them. We drew and we were winning 2-0 but obviously it’s a crucial point for us.

‘We need a win because if not it’s going to be very hard to qualify for the next round. A win could get us started.

‘We are a much better team than we’ve shown — and we can do even better.’

Zabaleta has warned his team-mates they must improve their form in the Champions League

Oliver Kahn believes Joe Hart is nowhere near the level of Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer

Meanwhile Zabaleta’s team-mate has come in for criticism from Bayern Munich legend Oliver Kahn, who says he needs to be more consistent to be considered alongside Bayern’s Manuel Neuer as the world’s best.

‘Neuer changed the game of goalkeeping,’ Kahn said. ‘Neuer makes a lot less mistakes than Hart. 

'If you look at him there are some games where he plays not very well, Manuel is more on a constant level than Hart. Hart needs to be more consistent.’

City face Bayern in Munich later this month with their qualification hopes on the line and Kahn said: ‘It’s a big chance for Bayern to put Manchester City out and they will want to do it.’
