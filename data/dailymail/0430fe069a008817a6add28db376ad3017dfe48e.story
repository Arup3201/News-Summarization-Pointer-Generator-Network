It may only be a throwaway line in a recent patent, but Apple has further hinted at plans for a range of electric cars.

In the patent, called 'Power management for inductive charging systems', Apple details a system of wirelessly charging 'portable electronic devices.'

And within the list of examples, alongside phones and tablets, is reference to 'electric vehicles'.  

In the patent, 'Power management for inductive charging systems', Apple details a system of wirelessly charging (illustrated) 'portable electronic devices.' And within the list of examples alongside phones and tablets is reference to 'electric vehicles'. This is the only mention of cars in the patent

This is the only mention of cars in the patent and it could simply be that Apple is hoping its charging technology works with various types of devices. 

But it follows weeks of rumours that the firm is developing a fleet of either electric of self-driving vehicles.

Apple first toyed with an in-car system at its Worldwide Developer Conference in 2013.

At that point it was known as 'iOS in the Car' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, under the moniker CarPlay.

Google used its own annual developer I/O in June to unveil Android Auto, a key feature of its latest operating system Android Lollipop. 

Android Auto works with any Android Lollipop phone to show information on the dashboard. 

Google has signed up more than 28 car makers including Abarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jeep, Kia, Maserati, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Ram, Renault, Seat, Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen and Volvo. 

The first wave of Android Auto cars are 'coming soon' - expected to launch this year.

The first car to be sold with CarPlay was Ferrari's FF in September.

Other partners include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen including its DS branch, Dodge, Fiat, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Jeep, Kia, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, Renault, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.

And by 2016 all new Ford models are expected to have  Android Auto or CarPlay.

'Many electronic devices include one or more rechargeable batteries that require external power to recharge from time to time, said Apple in the patent. 

'Often, these devices may be charged using the same or similar connection type, for example via USB. 

'However, despite having common connection types, multiple devices often require separate power supplies with different power outputs. These separate power supplies are burdensome to use, store, and transport from place to place.'

Apple added that charging cords are unsafe in certain circumstances including when 'a driver of a vehicle may become distracted attempting to plug an electronic device into a vehicle charger.'

Apple's Watch is fitted with a form of inductive charging, for example, but the patent takes this technology a step further.  

The tech giant proposes an 'adaptive power control system' that can detect the weight or 'load' of the portable device that has been placed on it.

It will then change the power supply accordingly based on which device is being charged and how much energy it requires. 

Recent reports claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. 

Speculation was rife last month when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras. Further cars were spotted in Florida and Hawaii.

If Apple was developing such technology, it would would rival Google's self-driving cars. 

Google's head of self-driving cars recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years.

The mention of electric vehicles could simply be reference to the fact Apple is hoping its technology works with various devices. But it follows weeks of rumours about an Apple range of electric self-driving cars

Chris Urmson added the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians.

Similarly, Apple is said to be working on a release date of 2020 for its own range of vehicles. 

These reports followed an email from an unnamed Apple employee that hinted the firm was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' 

It described 'vehicle development' at the company but didn't reveal further information.

In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range or a self-driving car that would ultimately also rival Google's autonomous project.

The cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self-driving software, for example.
