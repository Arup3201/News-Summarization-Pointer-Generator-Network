A new mother today faces an anxious wait to discover if the cancer which ravaged her body during pregnancy has passed to her son in the womb.

On Thursday Dani Maloney's six-month-old son Jayden will have tests at Birmingham Children's Hospital to discover if he has the disease.

His 26-year-old mother has been given just weeks to live, after being diagnosed with skin cancer after giving birth to her son.

In extremely rare cases it is possible for leukaemia and melanoma cancer cells to pass from mother to her unborn child

Mother-of-two Dani Maloney, 26, today faces an anxious wait to discover if the skin cancer which ravaged her body while pregnant was passed to her son Jayden

In 2009 British scientists identified the first case in Japan, where a mother was diagnosed with leukaemia after giving birth.

Eleven months later her daughter was diagnosed with the same disease and subsequent genetic tests revealed the baby girl had cancer cells at birth, and that they were passed from her mother.

Miss Maloney urged people who suspect they might have skin cancer to seek medical help.

She said: 'I want people to know how important it is to have any mole or skin blemish they’re concerned about checked-out.

'And don’t be afraid to challenge doctors, don’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion, and a third.'

The mother-of-two has started to compile memory boxes for Jayden and his older sister Amina, three.

Miss Maloney insists she raised her concerns with doctors last year, having spotted an mole growing in size on her leg.

She claims doctors told her it was due to skin pigmentation changes that are common during pregnancy.

Although extremely rare it is possible for cancer cells to pass from mother to unborn child, studies have shown. On Thursday, Jayden now six months old, right and left with his sister Amina, three, will undergo tests at Birmingham Children's Hospital to establish if he has the disease which is killing his mother

Birmingham's City Hospital said they sent out letters referring Miss Maloney to a skin specialist in November.

But the 26-year-old claims she was living temporarily at an address in Aston, and never received the letters.

'It upsets me because I won't see my kids grow up. I won't be there on that first day of school. I won't be playing games with them at birthday parties'

After giving birth to Jayden on January 14, a nurse at City Hospital cleaned and dressed a wound on Miss Maloney's leg.

But by that time the cancer was already spreading through her body.

She was referred to Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital six weeks ago gasping for breath, with suspected pneumonia.

Doctors admitted Miss Maloney to intensive care as her condition worsened.

A week ago she returned home after doctors dealt the devastating blow that she has less than two months to live.

'I didn’t take it well, I didn’t take it well at all,' she said. '"Why me?" I ask that all the time.'

Miss Maloney is now confined to her home, having been told her skin cannot be exposed to sunlight.

Pregnant women can transmit cancer to their unborn babies, though it is extremely rare.

In 2009 British scientists discovered a mother with leukaemia passed the blood disease to her daughter in the womb.

Normally a child's immune system would recognise and destroy any invasive cancer cells.

There are known to be only a handful of cases of mothers and babies sharing the same cancer.

Of the 30 past cases in 2009, most were leukaemia or melanoma - the most aggressive form of skin cancer.

Professor Mel Greaves, who led the study at the Institute of Cancer Resarch said the risks to an unborn baby is extremely low.

They investigated a case in Japan in which a 28-year-old was diagnosed with leukaemia shortly after she gave birth.

Eleven months later her daughter was also diagnosed with the disease.

The child was in remission in 2009, having had treatment for a year-and-a-half.

Genetic tests revealed the child had cancer cells at birth, and that they came from her mother.

Closer investigation revealed the child's leukaemia cells were missing a vital piece of DNA, which would have flagged them up as 'intruders' to her immune system.

Without this her system was unable to target and destroy the cancer cells, allowing the disease to develop.

The researchers said the same mutation could allow melanoma cancer cells to pass from mother to baby.

But they believe it is unlikely other cancers can be passed on this way.

She said her days are spent crafting items for her children's memory boxes and planning her own funeral as well as her children's christenings.

She said: 'I'll wear a pink tracksuit, pink trainers and a Birmingham City top and I want the club crest on my coffin.

'I want colour - I don't want black.

'It upsets me because I won’t see my kids grow up. I won’t be there on that first day at school.

'I won’t be playing games with them at birthday parties.

'I want them to remember me, to be happy, to do well, to go to university.

'I want them to make me proud.'

Macmillan nurses are helping the mother-of-two place pictures, letters, videos and arm bands in her children's memory boxes.

'The notes say I love them and I will always be there for them.

'I’ve told them never to forget me,' she said.

Miss Maloney's aunt Tina Adams, 48, said: 'My neice went into hospital with a chest infection. Then we were told it was terminal skin cancer. Every single day brings worse news.

'She was a typical dizzy 26-year-old, but yesterday Dani told me she looked in the mirror and the person looking back wasn’t her.

'That broke my heart. Dani should not be dying.'

Dr Roger Stedman, Medical Director at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear about Dani’s situation and wholeheartedly back her call for anyone who has concerns about a suspicious mole or skin blemish to seek advice at the earliest opportunity.

'As part of her antenatal care a rapid access referral was made in November for Dani to see a specialist at our skin centre in December and January, but unfortunately she failed to attend on both occasions and her GP was informed.'
