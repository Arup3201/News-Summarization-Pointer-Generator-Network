Pippa chose designs by Roksanda Ilincic and Stella McCartney

Wore three different outfits during appearance at Fulham book store

Her big sister has had more than a year to become one of the world’s fashion icons.

So when it came to her big day in the spotlight, perhaps Pippa Middleton thought she had some catching up to do.

The 29-year-old wore no fewer than four outfits for her book launch in London yesterday, altogether costing at least £2,959 – more than some first-time authors might hope for as an advance.

But then, Miss Middleton – whose advance was said to be an astonishing £400,000 –  isn’t any first-time author.

Eight
 camera crews from around the world were on hand as she launched her 
party planning guide Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for 
Families and Friends at a Fulham book store.

The
 hostess with the mostess chose a plum-coloured shift from one of sister
 Kate's favourite designers Roksanda Ilincic to pose for photographers 
before changing in to an embellished LBD by Markus Lupfer to host a children's Halloween 
party in the store. She finally donning a tweed panelled dress from 
Stella McCartney as she left the event to continue the celebrations with
 friends and family.

Earlier
 she had worn another different outfit for the book signing at Foyles, 
choosing a futuristic long-sleeved dress featuring an abstract panel by Paper London which is on sale on their website for £395.

Earlier this afternoon Pippa tried to sneak in to the book store via the back entrance, but her famous curves gave the game away and photographers snapped her disappearing in to Daunt books in the elegant knee-length shift, which she teamed with patent stiletto shoes and a power blow-dry to rival sister Kate's glossy mane.

After posing for photographers with her book Pippa changed in to a little black dress featuring a sparkling green pattern to play with the children who were attending her Halloween party.

And then there was another quick change as she pulled on a sleeveless tweed dress from British designer Stella McCartney featuring slimming optical illusion panels on the back, which she accessorised with a Tabitha London clutch bag and bespoke Emmy court shoes.

Pippa chose a sparkling Markus Lupfer LBD as her second outfit of the afternoon and then changed in to a sleeveless tweed Stella McCatrney dress for the evening

Appearing in front of a scrum of 
photographers and camera men Pippa said: 'It's incredibly exciting and I
 feel really lucky to be in this position to publish a book so that's 
great.

'It has been a crazy couple of years 
since my sister's wedding but  it's had its upsides and downsides I just
 feel really fortunate to be able to build a career as a writer.

David Loftus, the photographer who 
took the pictures for the book said: 'She's the sweetest kindest girl 
and -- you know she is very shy.

'This has all come about you know 
because of the wedding, because of her sister, but it is essentially 
what she was doing before

'She's doing her best in very 
difficult surroundings really. She's expecting to be criticized, she 
doesn't deserve it, she works incredibly hard. 

'She deserves the success. So I hope people read it and look at it and see it for what it is.'

Reviews
 so far have been mixed with some critics slamming Pippa for cashing in 
on her royal connections to make money out of stating the obvious (there
 are tips on how to make a cup of tea) but retail experts predict that 
it will be a Christmas best-seller.

Writing
 in the book she acknowledges the effect her sister the Duchess of 
Cambridge’s fame will have on sales, saying: ‘I know many of you will 
pick up the book out of nothing more than curiosity.

‘[But]
 I can assure you that it feels even stranger to me than it probably 
does to you to have seen so much written about me when I have done so 
little to paint a picture of myself.

'This is my first chance to do that and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.

'The
 book is designed to be a comprehensive guide to home entertaining, 
based on my experience in my family’s business Party Pieces and work for
 London-based events company Table Talk.’

Pippa Middleton launched her new creative entertaining book 'Celebrate' at an afternoon children's party held in Fulham, South west London

The book is a guide to entertaining: 'I hope you will see this as a feel-good book with ideas to look forward to each month,' said Pippa

Although her royal relatives are not 
referred to by name in the book, Kate is frequently mentioned as Pippa 
recalls some of her happiest childhood memories, such as hugely 
competitive family Easter egg hunts and bringing their parents breakfast
 in bed.

  ‘Celebrate’ is a comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative 
entertaining. It is a useful, practical and inspiring journey into 
British-themed occasions, focusing on tradition and ritual and the 
importance of bringing family and friends together. Including recipes, 
crafts, games and tips on entertaining, it will take you from Bonfire 
Night to New Year’s Eve, Children’s Parties to Barbecues and everything 
in between, with ideas and occasions to look forward to throughout the 
year.

'I have funny memories of creeping up
 the stairs with my brother and sister, carrying a breakfast tray for 
our parents as a surprise treat: desperately trying not to spill the tea
 and orange juice or knock over the vase of flowers, stifling our 
giggles so that they couldn't hear us coming,' she writes.

Tips from party queen Pippa include 
how to throwing the perfecting Highland tea and rustling up a quick 
'venison and beetroot stew'.

One of the book's more eye-catching 
chapters is dedicated to breakfast which, Pippa says helpfully, can be 
'anything from a simple pot of tea with a few digestive biscuits' to a 
fully laden tray.

For a special breakfast she advises 
decanting milk into a jug rather than serving it in a carton. She also 
suggesting serving a boiled with soldiers liberally spread with smoked 
mackerel or trout pate and includes recipes for each

There is also a segment dedicated on 
how to make a cup of tea or roast a chicken as well as rustle up some 
remarkably pretty home-made Christmas decorations or some haggis and 
filo parcels for Burns Night.

'It is a useful and practical 
journey into British-themed occasions and I hope it offers welcome 
inspiration and ideas, most of which needn't leave you alarmingly out of
 pocket.

'Entertaining on any scale can be stressful and daunting so this
 is all about finding ways to manage and enjoy the process.

‘I hope you will see this as a feel-good book with ideas to look forward
 to each month, providing threads of lasting, happy memories, be it 
around a table lit with candles in winter, outside on a rug in summer or
 in the autumn, perched on a leaf-covered bench, hot drink in hand.’

Louise Moore, Managing Director of 
Michael Joseph the publishers who reportedly paid £400,000 for the 
rights to the guide said: ‘Pippa Middleton's ‘Celebrate’ is a truly 
inspiring treasure trove of fun ideas and creative suggestions for key 
celebrations throughout the year.

'We are delighted to be her publishers and to have worked with her on this milestone publication.’

Across the city, also in purple, Queen Elizabeth was attending a very different kind of event on the South Bank as she marked the recent transformation of the Jubilee Gardens which was completed 35 years after they were first created in 1977 to celebrate the Queen's silver jubilee.

She was also given a tour of the British Film Institute (BFI) and learned about a new computer archive system for visitors to look up films and newsreels as she watched old movies of her as a young mother.
