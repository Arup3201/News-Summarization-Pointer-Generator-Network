THAT'S NOT CRICKET, MARIA

Maria Sharapova may come to regret admitting that she did not know of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar - who watched her third-round match from the Royal Box last Saturday - with unhappy Indians bombarding her Facebook page with angry messages.

It also resulted in the hashtag #whoismariasharapova trending worldwide on Twitter.

Interestingly, Tendulkar’s Facebook page has almost six and a half million more likes with 20.2m to Sharapova’s 13.7m.

What have I done? Sharapova may come to regret not knowing who Sachin Tendulkar is

FOGNINI BARES ALL

Fabio Fognini may have lost in the third round here this year but the eccentric Italian is still causing quite a stir after posing naked for the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.

It is all for a good cause, though, with the centrefold shoot - which shows off a Grumpy dwarf tattoo on his right hip - raising awareness for Cancer Research UK.

Fognini is currently dating fellow Italian player Flavia Pennetta - the ex-girlfriend of former world No 1 Carlos Moya.

NICOLAS MA-WHO?

One of the most popular spots for photographs at the All England Club is the plaque on the wall by Court 18 that commemorates the longest tennis match in history between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut in 2010.

Yet it was somewhat surprising to spot Frenchman Mahut - who lost 70-68 in a fifth set lasting eight hours and 15 minutes - stroll alone through the large Wimbledon crowds relatively unnoticed.

LI NA SPLITS FROM COACH

World No 2 Li Na suffered a disappointing exit in the third round last week and has now split with her coach of two years, Carlos Rodriguez.

The Chinese 32-year-old is considered to have played her best tennis under the guidance of Rodriguez - winning her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open this year - but the 50-year-old Argentine has ended the relationship to spend more time at his academy in Beijing.

ANNE'S CALLING THE SHOTS

Since retiring from the sport after her first-round defeat here last year, Britain’s Anne Keothavong has forged a successful post-tennis career as a commentator and pundit.

Thursday marked the first occasion she had worked on the same match as her umpire brother James when she called Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci’s victory over Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua.

She tweeted: ‘Commentating on a match with my brother in the chair for the first time. #weird.’

SAPWELL FLIES THE FLAG

The gloom at SW19 following Andy Murray’s quarter-final exit was lifted somewhat by big-serving Josh Sapwell yesterday, as the 18-year-old from Bedfordshire progressed to the boys’ singles quarter-finals by beating Peruvian Pedro Iamachkine 6-1, 6-3.

Sapwell is the sole Brit remaining in the junior events after three girls, Maia Lumsden, Katie Boulter and Gabriella Taylor, were knocked out in quick succession.
