Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has appeared in court to face charges that he viciously beat his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside a New York restaurant.

The 33-year-old Pump It Up singer turned himself into police on Wednesday when he attended the 34th Precinct station house in Inwood, Manhattan with his lawyer present.

He was later arraigned on charges of assault, grand larceny and robbery in Manhattan Criminal Court.

However, according to the Daily News, the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew member was later released after his mother posted the $10,000 bail needed to free him.

He told them as he left the courthouse: 'It's good to be free.

'I’ve been portrayed worse by better,' he added.

Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop 

He was also ordered to sign an order of protection forbidding him from contacting the ex-girlfriend.

According to police, Budden forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am last Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard.

Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her.

A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’

The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack.

TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating.

The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head.

New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former girlfriend on Instagram  with other men in a nightclub. 

The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.'

The lawyer added that the reality TV star is co-operating with the investigation.

Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' 

Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men                                      

The rapper has continued to be active on Twitter since the allegations surfaced and last Saturday morning even posted pictures on Instagram from a strip club.

He also directed his ire at the New York Police Department via social after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down.

In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the New York City native said he was going to sue.

In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.
