Centre stage: Artist Marina Abramovic is to appear alone in a gallery and will interact with visitors as part of a new show

A top performance artist has banned visitors to her new show from bringing phones, cameras or computers in a bid to force people to live in the moment.

Marina Abramovic will be appearing on her own at London's Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens and intends to simply interact with those who come to see her.

But the gallery has installed lockers in its foyer, in which visitors will have to leave their electronic devices before entering the room.

Belgrade-born Abramovic, 68, hopes the move will stop those who come to see her hiding behind their phone screens and taking photographs of things 'they don't even experience' at the time.

She said: 'In these lockers they can put their BlackBerries and phones and camera and computers and watches.

'We don't want people to come here and phone and blog and tweet before they have even seen it, as they do all the time.

'We want people to come as they are, with nothing, as I am. From then we will see what is going to happen. From that energy, every day is different. That is why it is so hard for me to explain to you what I am going to do, because I don't know.'

Abramovic, who collaborated with Lady Gaga on a video last year, will appear before an audience of up to 160 people for eight hours a day for her 64-day exhibition, which opens on Wednesday.

In a sneak preview of the show yesterday, she took members of a preview audience and placed them in various locations in the white-walled gallery, leading them by the hand, whispering to them and giving instructions.

Launching the work, she said: 'There is nothing. Just empty walls, there's no more, and just me.'

She went on: 'I think I push my limits here. I couldn't do anything more radical than I am doing now - and I am terrified.'

Abramovic 
will be aided by a team of 45 black-clad 'guards' who will ensure her 
welfare and she says she may choose to use some props - including 
chairs, tables and mirrors - although much of each day will be spent on 
her feet.

The New York-based artist, who will wear a simple black and white outfit each day, will take no rests other than toilet breaks.

She said she had some concerns about how a British audience will react to the wacky idea.

She said: 'The British public is different. You're cynical, you really like the bad jokes and you drink too much at the weekends, so I am very worried about your public - the only way that I can win here, the British public, is to be extremely vulnerable and humble, that I am there for you at this impossible moment.'

Her new exhibition is her first major performance work since she appeared at New York's Museum Of Modern Art in 2010, with The Artist Is Present, in which she sat in silence for three months with visitors invited to gaze into her eyes.

As part of another exhibit last year, rapper Jay-Z danced with her for six hours while performing his song Picasso Baby at the Pace Gallery in New York.
