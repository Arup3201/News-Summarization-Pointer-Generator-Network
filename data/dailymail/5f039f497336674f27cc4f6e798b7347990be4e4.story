Louis van Gaal has baulked at suggestions Manchester United must bolster their defence in the January transfer window.

Manager Van Gaal claimed United have 'more than enough' defensive cover and quality, despite Chris Smalling's groin problem further stretching resources.

Robin van Persie's double sneaked United past Southampton 2-1 at St Mary's on Monday but they struggled tactically and defensively.

Luke Shaw, Rafael and Phil Jones are out injured, as is Daley Blind, who could slot in as an emergency centre half. 

Van Gaal shrugged off criticism of his defensive stocks after switching England midfielder Michael Carrick into a makeshift defensive role midway through Monday's clash.

'When you have injuries you cannot solve the problem otherwise,' said Van Gaal.

'Do we have to buy players? No. We have more than enough.'

Van Gaal's terse defence of his squad depth did little to mask United's continued rearguard shortcomings.

Van Persie converted United's only two chances on the south coast as Van Gaal's men moved third in the Premier League with a fifth-straight win.

Southampton pressed continually, pulling Van Gaal's systems and structures apart almost at will, though too often failing to deliver the killer blow.

Marouane Fellaini's inept performance forced Van Gaal to haul youngster Paddy McNair off before half-time, in the hope Ander Herrera could add midfield bite.

That led to Carrick's rearguard shift, with fit-again Jonny Evans replacing Smalling after his groin injury.

United are still missing Luke Shaw, Rafael, Phil Jones and Daley Blind, and that injured defensive quartet formed the foundation of Van Gaal's justification of his squad depth.

United host Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday, with former defender Gary Neville predicting the clash could descend into pub-league standard.

England coach Neville claimed United 'got away with murder' at St Mary's, before tipping the Liverpool clash to resemble 'The Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion'.

The unimpressed Van Gaal warned Neville to 'pay attention to his words', asking reporters to interpret his comments however they saw fit.

Neville later denied talk of a rift with Van Gaal when asked about a 'feud' on social media.

One Twitter user asked Neville following the match: '@r1fgm: @GNev2 the press mentioning a feud between yourself and Van Gaal. What feud?'

And Neville replied: 'One that will be created that doesn't exist.'
