It emerged that Lib Dems complained that Jo Swinson (pictured with Nick Clegg) became pregnant when a minister

A woman Liberal Democrat who hoped to become an MP was told by her local party not to get pregnant because the electorate did not want to see a ‘baby hanging off your t***’.

The shocking remark was made by an older woman who held a senior post in the constituency association and helped with selections.

Speaking privately, the former candidate said: ‘My jaw dropped when I was told, “I hope you are not planning on falling pregnant. We don’t want a baby hanging off your t*** during the campaign”.’

The revelations came as other women 
Lib Dems spoke at a fringe meeting at the conference of ingrained sexism
 when trying to be chosen for Westminster.

It
 also emerged politicians had complained to a Lib Dem peer that business
 minister Jo Swinson had dared to get pregnant while in a government 
post.

Baroness 
Northover, a Lib Dem spokesman on equalities in the Lords, said she had 
been shocked when a colleague said: ‘How could she get herself in that 
position when she is a minister?’

The Lib Dems, who claim to be the champions of equality, have the fewest female MPs of any of the main parties.

Just 12 per cent of its MPs are women, compared with 16 per cent of Conservatives and 31 per cent of Labour.

At the fringe event, activist Marion Wilson said: ‘We have some talented women in their 30s.

'They’ve
 been going through held-seat selections and asked by members – phoned 
up by women no less – “Are you planning to get married? Are you going to
 have children? How will that impact on you being an MP?” ’

A
 Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Questions of this sort should be ruled out by 
the returning officer. We are implementing reforms to tackle unconscious
 bias and discrimination at every level of the party.’

The Lib Dems, led by Nick Clegg, have fewest number of female MPs of any major party with just 12 per cent
