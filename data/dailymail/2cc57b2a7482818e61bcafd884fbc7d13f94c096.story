He disappeared for five days embarking on a 17-mile trip, leaving his owners distraught.

When Crockett the cat went missing Pauline and Bill Lowe desperately hoped he would return to their Essex home.

But the couple, both 66, never imagined just what their treasured pet had been up to.

For the adventurous grey tabby had indulged in a little sofa surfing, getting trapped inside an old three-seater destined for the charity shop.

Reunited: Delighted Pauline and Bill Lowe were reunited with missing Crockett five days after he disappeared from their Essex home. The grey tabby got trapped in an old sofa the couple were donating to a charity shop

There he lay for four days quietly hiding in the piece of furniture donated to the St Luke's Hospice charity in Grays Essex, by the 66-year-olds.

Workers collected the old sofa, complete with Crockett lurking inside, from the Lowe's Corringham home.

For four days Crockett hid inside the sofa, on the shop floor, without detection despite being surrounded by unsuspecting volunteers and bargain-hunters.

The trapped cat was only discovered when the new owners, who asked not to be named, noticed meowing sounds coming from inside the three-seater.

The bemused couple called the hospice shop to alert them to their unexpected free gift.

Crockett is now back at home and has now been given a clean bill of health after his sofa surfing adventure.

The relieved owners believe their 
curious cat sneaked inside the sofa’s body when it was taken apart to 
allow it to be removed from the house.

Mrs Lowe said: 'We noticed Crockett was missing straight away but could not think where he might have gone.

'He doesn’t go anywhere so I was really worried.'

The couple searched high and low for their missing moggy but were only reunited after St Luke’s staff received the bizarre phone call from the sofa’s new owners.

She added: 'The whole family are delighted to have Crockett back.

'He is a lovely cat and we were devastated when he went missing - our other cat Tubbs was missing him too.

'We can’t believe how he must have tucked himself into the inside of the sofa during the short time the bottom had been removed and remained silent for so long.'

The couple have owned Crockett since he was a kitten and say this is the first time he had ever disappeared.

Jenny Munro, manager for St. Luke’s, said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was told when a customer phoned to say that they had bought a sofa from our shop and that they were delighted with the purchase except for the fact it had a cat inside.

'Apparently the new owners of the sofa heard a soft meow sound.

'On further investigation of the sofa they saw two claws poking out of the material which moved away when touched.

'In order to release the cat they had to rip the material under the sofa as Crockett had lodged himself well into the back.

'After giving the cat some TLC, a good drink and food they contacted us.

'Everyone is happy with the outcome and we have all been saying how amazing the chain of events was and what a very lucky cat Crockett was as had the sofa been disposed of in other ways Crockett may not have been found.'

Round-trip: Crockett the cat travelled 17 miles from his owners' home in Corringham, to the shop in Grays. He then travelled from there to the sofa's new owners' home in Grays and back to be reunited with his the Lowes in Corringham
