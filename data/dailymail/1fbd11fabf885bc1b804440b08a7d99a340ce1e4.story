It wouldn't be India if preparations for the newest grand prix in the calendar weren't a bit last minute.

And today, as British Formula One star Jenson Button whizzed round the new £250m Buddh International Circuit, near Delhi, in a rickshaw, workers were carrying out a series of last minute fixes.

Clumps of grass were being replaced, other sections were being PAINTED and the stands were given a wash down with hoses ahead of tomorrow's first practice session.

As the touches were applied, nervous 
officials looked on desperately hoping the country will be able to shake
off the image of incompetency that accompanied the country's hosting of
last year's Commonwealth Games.

Ready to rock: Jenson Button pulls to a stop after testing the new Indian Grand Prix circuit in a motorised rickshaw

Fastest thing on three wheels: British driver Button puts the vehicle through its paces at the new £250m Buddh International Circuit in Noida, 24 miles north of New Delhi

Another fine drive: Button steps out of an auto rickshaw - he can expect a slightly zippier view of the track from his own car in Sunday's race

There are problems with some of the 
plumbing and electrics, and concerns over the lack of testing that has 
taken place on the track.

The drivers will know the track inside out thanks to thousands of hours in their simulators, but with the first race session due to start tomorrow, time is running a bit short

Only Button's motorised rickshaw, a 
scooter ridden by former multi world champion Michael Schumacher and a 
pedal bicycle with Italian Jarno Trulli on board have so far been able 
to sample the 3.1-mile circuit.

The prospect of having Button, Lewis Hamilton, world champion elect Sebastien Vettel and his Red Bull team-mate Mark Webber hurtling round the rack at 200mph-plus has many race fans fearing the worst.

But despite their concerns, and a 
series of power cuts during the inaugural press conference, confidence 
remains high among Formula One chiefs that the event will be an unequivocal success.

Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone 
said: 'Super. The track is super. They did everything we wanted them to 
do within, what, two or three years of reaching the agreement.

'It took Silverstone in England 25 years, so I 
think they've done very well. I was pessimistic a fortnight ago. I was 
sent pictures of the track and I thought: 'Christ, we're not going to 
get it finished in time'.

'But what they have done in the 
meantime is incredible. The people there are very anxious to be sure 
they're doing a good job and they are very passionate about their 
sport.'

Indians are desperate to remove the 
stigma that accompanied the debacle of the Commonwealths - where 
corruption was rife, snakes were found in athletes' hotel rooms and a 
stadium collapsed with fatal consquences.

To drum up interest in the event, 
which many Indians have admitted to remaining completely ignorant about,
Indian cricket great Sachin Tendulkar has been drafted in as chief 
cheerleader.

He will wave the checkered flag on 
the race while Bollywood's leading lights will also jostle for a share 
of the limelight before the start.

The race has also been given the seal
of approval by retired triple world champion Jackie Stewart, who said: 
'I just walked in and it looks hugely impressive.

'From just driving in, the scale of 
it, it's extraordinary. I think it's wonderful and this is the new 
world. When we think of the old world, we can't do that.

'But it will still take two years to get it right. Just like it will take two years to get the new Silverstone complex right.

'It's not anything to do with India 
or England, it's to do with just the realities of making everything 
synchronised and working without any glitches.'

And Vicky Chandhok, father of Team 
Lotus reserve driver Karun and head of the Indian Motorsports 
Federation, said: 'Let's be honest, it's like a new-born child.

'You've got to nurse it along. We've 
all got to accept there are a few shortcomings but at least the will to 
do it is there. That's the most important factor.

'There's no lack of money or will to do it. It will get done. The promoters are very clear. Whatever it takes, spend it.'

Speaking of the track itself, he 
added: 'You've got some electrical and plumbing issues but the circuit, 
talk to any driver and I think they are absolutely gobsmacked this 
morning.

'They loved the circuit. There's not a single team principal that hasn't come up to me and said what a fantastic circuit it is.'

Sebastian Vettel, who will be gunning
for his eleventh victory of a season in which the German could still 
equal compatriot Michael Schumacher's 2004 record with Ferrari of 13 in a
single year, said he had been busy learning the layout of the new 
track, but had not yet drive on it.

The 24-year-old said: 'By the time we
race in India, I'll have done several laps of the track on the 
simulator. We're expecting the track to have the second highest average 
speed of the season after Monza.

'That means that we'll be completing a
lap at an average speed of 235kph, so there should be plenty of good 
opportunities to overtake.'

British-based Force India, who have 
no Indian drivers or mechanics, have taken out full-page advertisements 
in local media and set up a website calling on fans to 'Raise the Flag' 
under the slogan 'One nation. One soul. One Indian Team'.

On the track, the main battle will be
between Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari with the leading drivers focusing
purely on winning now that the championships are over.
