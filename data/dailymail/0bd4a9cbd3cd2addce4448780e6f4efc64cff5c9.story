A father-of-four has died after banging his head on a low tunnel over a canal and falling off his narrowboat into the water.

Michael Holgate, 58, was knocked into the canal beneath the Harecastle Tunnel near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire around 1pm on Tuesday.

His devoted wife of 32 years, Susan spent two hours trying to find him in 'pitch black conditions' before being forced to leave the boat to raise the alarm.

It is understood Susan, 55, and son 
Anthony, 44, who was also onboard, were on a
 different part of the barge when Mr Holgate fell in.

The couple, who previously ran Green Gables guest house in Windermere, Cumbria, had retired to their narrowboat last summer.

The
 father-of-four's family yesterday said he was an 'experienced boat 
handler' and the couple had planned to spend the rest of their lives 
together travelling Britain's waterways.

In
 a statement his family said: 'Michael was an experienced boat handler 
who, after retiring, followed his lifelong dream of moving onto his 
narrowboat with wife of 32 years, Susan.

'After travelling around the UK they were making their way north to attend his brother's wedding in June. In a tragic accident in the cramped Harecastle Tunnel, Mike banged his head and fell into the canal.

'Susan tried in vain in pitch black conditions to locate Mike, but after over two hours she had to get out and raise the alarm.

A
 force spokesman said: 'We received a call that a man travelling on a 
narrowboat had fallen overboard part way through the tunnel.

'The
 tunnel was closed to allow the fire service to carry out a search. They
 were later joined by the specialist underwater search team from 
Nottinghamshire Police.

'Specially trained police officers are supporting the man's family at this time.'

The tunnel was closed for some time while the emergency services were inside.

Mr Wilson added: 'The police told me they had sent boats through a couple of times to look for him but it's a very long tunnel. It's incredibly tragic for the family, my heart goes out to them.'
