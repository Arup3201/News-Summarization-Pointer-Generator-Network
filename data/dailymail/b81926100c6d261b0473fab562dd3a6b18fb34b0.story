As a double Olympic champion and world champion, Laura Trott is used to winning.

But there was one accolade that she was not happy to receive - a place in FHM's 'Sexiest Women in the World' list.

The 21-year-old snubbed the 'awards ceremony', saying it was a 'no go' area for her and she wanted to focus on her athletic career rather than strip off for lads' mags.

Double Olympic winner Laura Trott says the realm of lads' mags are a no-go for her and finds it unappealing

Refreshingly, the Olympic record holder has refused to compromise her principles by conforming to pressures for women to look a certain way.

The successful cyclist made it clear that the world of sexualised photoshoots did not appeal to her and she did not want to make lads mags part of her image.

Her decision is a stark contrast to her 
fellow London Olympic teammates, who have posed for magazines in racy 
underwear and appeared naked for billboard adverts.

Trott, who won her second gold medal 
in the Omnium at the track cycling World Cup in Manchester this week, 
conceded that there is a 'pressure to fulfil a certain image' but says 
that she refuses to allow it affect her.

Writing
in the Daily Telegraph this week Trott, from Hertfordshire, wrote: 
'Earlier this year I was asked to attend an awards ceremony for the 
Sexiest Women in the World.

'That was just a no-go for me. That whole other side of things just does not appeal to me.

'I do sport because I like being an athlete.

'I
want to inspire young girls to get on their bikes, and I just believe 
there is a certain way of doing that, a certain way that I want to be 
seen.'

Trott, who is in a relationship with her Olympic teammate Jason Kenny, avoided criticising her fellow cyclists, saying that it was her choice not to raise her profile through suggestive photos shoots.

It is not just the female athletes who have stripped off to raise their profiles. Half of Team GB have taken part in suggestive shoots.

In 2009 cyclist Victoria Pendleton posed on the cover and inside FHM lounging in a slinky white halterneck costume, black stilettos and bustier, and striking a pose in black bikini bottoms and basque.

Last year Swimmer Gregor Tait and triple jumper Phillips Idowu - along with cyclist Rebecca Romero - were photographed naked to promote an energy drink.

Synchronised swimmer Jenna Randall, triathlete Hollie Avil, canoeist Jess Walker and water polo players Vicki Hawkins and Francesca Snell are among those who stripped down to their underwear to pose saucily for a 2012 charity calendar.

Gymnast Louis Smith appeared in just a pair of skin-tight leggings to perform on Strictly Come Dancing, while David Beckham regularly appears in underwear for designer adverts.
