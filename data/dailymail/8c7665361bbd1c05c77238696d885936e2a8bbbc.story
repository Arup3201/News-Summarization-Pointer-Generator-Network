The garlic is one thing. And we have learned to put up with the occasional whiff of onions or eye-watering Gitanes.

But yesterday France outdid itself in the nose-wrinkling stakes when a cloud of foul-smelling gas drifted across the Channel, leaving swathes of Britain spluttering in disgust.

Emergency services were deluged as householders, fearing some sort of environmental disaster was engulfing the country, rang the police, ambulance and fire brigades.

Wind: The noxious smell wafted across the Channel this morning after a leak at a chemical factory in Rouen, the historic city of Normandy in north eastern France

But, as they held their noses and 
slammed shut their windows, they were told in no uncertain terms that it
 wasn’t the end of the world – it was just France.

The gas cloud, said to smell of sweat
 and rotten eggs, drifted over from a factory in the northern French 
city of Rouen and caused an almighty stink as the day went on.

After wafting over Sussex, Kent, 
Hampshire and Surrey, it made its way north. By the afternoon, it was 
causing misery across Oxfordshire and in to the East Midlands.

The National Grid, responsible for 
the nation’s electricity supply, said it had received an ‘unprecedented’
 100,000 calls by mid-afternoon.

The news of the pong’s origins led to some mirth on Twitter.

‘It’s now official, France smells,’ wrote Twitter user Phillip Smith.

The gas is thought to have leaked 
from a plant run by Lubrizol, a company that makes additives for 
industrial lubricants and paint, and is based near Rouen, 75 miles 
north-west of Paris.

Winds blew the invisible cloud south towards Paris on Monday before it turned back and crossed into England yesterday.

Last night experts said the cloud, 
made up of methyl mercaptan gas, posed no threat to public health 
although it could cause nausea in some people.

Mercaptan has a sulphurous smell and 
is added to odourless natural gas as a safety precaution.

A spokesman 
for the Health Protection Agency said: ‘It is not toxic and has also 
been diluted before entering the air over England, so people should be 
reassured it will cause no harm.

‘It is an unpleasant odour which may cause some people to feel slightly nauseous but it will dispel naturally.’

Lubrizol’s operations director Pierre-Jean Payrouse admitted the gas smelled ‘very bad’.

He told French radio that the plant was trying to contain the problem but the cause remained unknown.

He said: ‘It’s not so much a leak as a product that has decomposed, which smells very bad and which is escaping.

‘An investigation is under way but our priority is to deal with the problem.’

The cloud was not only a headache for Britain.

A French Cup soccer match between 
Rouen and Olympique Marseille had to be postponed and some Rouen 
residents have complained of migraines.

The fire brigade in the county of Kent, warned residents to keep their doors and windows closed due to a gas cloud it believed had come from France and London police said it had reports of an acrid smell in southeast London.

Harmless: Officials at Lubrizol factory in France, which makes additives for industrial lubricants and paint, said the sulphur-like smell was from a harmless additive in natural gas

Noxious smell: As the gas cloud spread across Kent concerned calls came in from residents in Maidstone, Ashford, Dover (pictured)  and Folkestone

London's Metropolitan Police tweeted: 'We are aware of reports of a 
strong, noxious, gas-like smell in some South East London boroughs. No 
risks to public.'

London Fire Brigade tweeted: 'We’ve been called to 25 gas incidents since 10.30am. The rotten egg smell is coming from France but has no risk to public #zutalors'

Hastings resident Lucy Parker, 27, said: 'It is totally disgusting and makes you wretch.'

Another local, James Boyes, 42, of Dover, Kent, said: 'The smell is just like the worst flatulent person ever standing with their back turned to you.

'It is truly, truly awful and the sooner they plug that leak the better for all concerned.

Crew manager Andy Batchelor at Folkestone Fire Station said it had received 30 phone calls between 6.30am and 8.50am from as far as Dover, Lydd and Ashford this morning from members of the public reporting a smell of gas.

He added: 'Transco believes there is a gas cloud sitting over south east Kent.

'Dover Coastguard have had reports from the French authorities saying there was a gas leak between Rouen and Paris.

'The prevailing winds have come from that area but it is not yet confirmed that the smell is from that source.'

A report on the Kent Fire and Rescue Service website attributed it to the French stink.

It
 said: 'South Kent residents are being asked to keep doors and windows 
closed due to a gas cloud that is believed to have come across from 
France, following reports of a gas leak from a factory 75 miles west of 
Paris.

'Kent Fire and Rescue Service is aware and liaising with partner agencies.'

Some schools closed believing the stench to be down to a gas leak on the premises.
