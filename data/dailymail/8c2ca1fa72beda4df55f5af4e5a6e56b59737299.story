Jewish community leaders in Rome have called for authorities to bar any public celebration of the 100th birthday of a  convicted Nazi war criminal.

Former SS officer  Erich Priebke is serving a life sentence under house arrest for his part in the 1944 massacre of 335 Italian civilians, including 75 Jews,
at caves south of Rome

But ten years ago, as the Nazi officer marked his 90th birthday, people travelled from Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland to celebrate.

Former SS officer, Erich Priebke (in white cap) is serving a life sentence under house arrest for taking part in the 1944 massacre of 335 Italian civilians, including about 75 Jews

Ten years ago, as the Nazi officer marked his 90th birthday, people travelled from Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland to celebrate

It is rumoured that many are intending to make the journey again on July 29 as Priebke marks his centenary, the Jewish Daily Forward reports. 

The president of Rome’s Jewish community 
Riccardo Pacifici has now called on Italy’s president and prime minister, the mayor of Rome and 
other officials to bar people from 'paying homage' to Priebke at the house where
he is being held.

He said: 'Priebke is a man who was condemned for war crimes, who has never 
repented, who has never apologised, who has never had pity for the 
families of the victims.'

It is rumoured that many are intending to make the journey again on July 29 as Priebke marks his centenary, angering the Jewish community, which has called for a ban on public celebrations

He added: 'The bone of contention is not the centenary of Priebke  but the tribute that many make to him by going to his house. It is to them that we express our indignation, not only as Jews but as Italians.' Wanted in Rome reports.

The way in which Priebke's house arrest has been handled has also angered the local community. 

On Tuesday La Repubblica showed a video in which Priebke sauntered around in his local neighbourhoos in one of his reported 'daily walks'.

And pictures published by the Italian weekly Oggi have previously shown Priebke eating at restaurants, riding a scooter 
and shopping.

Rome's Mayor Ignazio Marino has reportedly responded and said he would 'personally keep watch' to ensure no such public celebration takes place.

On March 24, 1944  senior Nazis ordered the execution of 335 hostages - including 75 Jews - in retaliation for an attack on Rome’s Via Rasella, in which 33 German soldiers were killed.

The way in which Priebke's house arrest has been handled has also angered the local community. He has apparently been seen dining with friends, shopping and riding a scooter. He was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest 'because of poor health and age'

It has been claimed that word was sent directly from Adolf Hitler via SS command in Rome that ten Italians should be slain for every German murdered. The killings should be carried out within 24 hours, he said.

Priebke, responsible for overseeing the list of those killed, was accused of ordering the deaths of five more prisoners who were brought by error in to the caves. He is said to have personally killed two.

After escaping from the 
British prison camp in 1946 he travelled to Rome where he secured false 
documents and moved to Argentina, settling in the ski resort San Carlos 
de Bariloche, even becoming a delicatessen owner, it is said.

Priebke is escorted by police as he is transferred to the Forte Boccea military prison in Rome after an appeal in the mid 1990s. In 1999 he was allowed by authorities to serve his sentence under house arrest, on grounds of poor health and old age

His past was only revealed in 1994, by investigative American journalists who were on the tail of another convicted war criminal.

He was extradited to Italy in 1995, and was sentenced to life in prison. In 1999 he was allowed by authorities to serve his sentence under house arrest, on grounds of poor health and old age.

His lawyers and friends have previously said he has turned to Christianity and has been a victim of a media witch hunt.
