An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of stabbing his friend's nine-year-old brother to death in a Northern California town.

Jordan was stabbed in the neck and declared dead after his family drove him to Brentwood's John Muir Hospital. 

Deputies put out an alert for Schultz after they said he got away in a truck outside the home.

Schultz was arrested at a hospital in Antioch at 3pm.

Contra Costa County sheriff's spokesman Jimmy Lee said a nurse who saw media coverage of the case recognized the wanted suspect.

Officials didn't say what Schultz was being treated for and the motive for the stabbing remains under investigation.

The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home (right) on Saturday on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz

Deputies were told on the police radio that the victim had been stabbed in the neck, reports the San Francisco Gate. 

The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz.

Neighbors say five children lived there and it is believed Schultz may have been friends with one of the older siblings, reports ABC7.

Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental

The Contra Costa Times reports the stabbing occurred mere yards from the school the younger boy attended.

Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental.

'This wasn't a random act. This wasn't some sort of stranger that came into the home and murdered a child. This was a family friend,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. 

'This little guy was the most energetic on the team,' said Almgren's Little League coach Mike De Lambert told KCRA.

'Great smile. And he was infectious, in a positive way, to everybody that he came in contact with.'

Discovery Bay is a waterfront community along the banks of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.
