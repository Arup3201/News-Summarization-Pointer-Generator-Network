Sea change: Less people are getting married and having children in Britain as people would rather just live together

British family life has changed for good as people are now just as likely to live together and have a baby as they are to get married.

Cohabiting is no longer the 'trial run' it was for most couples, as for the first time the number of married couples with children equals those in the same situation who refuse to tie the knot.

Last year 38 per cent of cohabiting couples were parents, exactly the same ratio as married couples with children.

It proves far fewer Britons now believe the traditional view that children should be brought up in a home with married parents, despite evidence clearly showing that many more married couples stay together when compared to unmarried ones.

Experts at Leeds University, working for Co-operative Legal Services, found the number of married couples with children at home has crashed by 320,000 in the last decade.

The report, using data from the Office for National Statistics, also shows that unmarried couples in the same situation went up by 290,000 in the same period - up a third.

The number of lone parent families has also rocketed - up more than 200,000 in ten years.

Christina Blacklaws, Director of Family Law at The Co-operative Legal Services, said: 'There are all sorts of different reasons why people cohabit but one of the important aspects of this report is that it shows how socially acceptable it is as a way of forming a family.

'That was always a taboo in days gone by – you might live together, or ‘live in sin’ as a precursor to marriage but what the research now shows is that for the majority of people it is fine if people chose together and have children.

'For me as a lawyer the big issue here is that despite that level of acceptance, people still labour under the complete misunderstanding that if you are in an unmarried family the law is going to protect you.'

'Cohabitation is not just seen as a 
"trial run" before marriage and children, but, for an increasing number 
of people, as a replacement for marriage as a setting for both long-term
relationships and the raising of children,' the report says.

Although married couples are still in the majority, just over one in three cohabiting pairs now have children, exactly the same number as those who are married.

Kate Pinder lives with her partner, Colin Kennedy. They got together in May 2009 and had a daughter, Erin, in May 2012.

'Having been through a long term relationship which didn’t work but we tried to make work by planning a wedding, I am much more relaxed with Colin. Our relationship just feels right, so I don’t feel that I need to be married,' she said.

'It’s not that I am against marriage and, in fact, Colin and I probably will get married, not least as I want the same surname as Erin. However, I definitely didn’t feel that I needed us to be married in order to have a child.'

A poll in the report by YouGov also found that only a quarter of people interviews believe they should be married before having a child.

But more than half thought it was more important to be in a 'committed relationship' - showing that living together is now seen as much more practical.

By contrast 53 per cent thought it was not important provided the parents were in 'a committed relationship' while a combined 42 per cent said they had no desire ever to get married or would do it simply to reduce the cost of living.
