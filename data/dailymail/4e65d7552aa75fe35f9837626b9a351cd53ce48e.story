There has been a great deal spoken about the sweltering heat and humidity England will face in Manaus when they play Italy on Saturday night.

But how does it actually feel to run and exercise in such testing conditions?

With the help of a Battersea Park biodome, an industrial-sized heater and a treadmill, Adam Shergold found out.

It takes less than 10 seconds for the first bead of sweat to start trickling its way down from my forehead, off the tip of my nose and on to my soon-to-be-saturated shirt. 

It's a little disheartening for someone who considers themselves fairly fit, and is currently in training for a half-marathon, to be perspiring so uncontrollably after just a minute or so of exercise.

Ready, boys? England have been gradually acclimatising to the hot conditions in Brazil

But then the sweltering conditions of Manaus have no mercy on anyone, not even the super-fit elite footballers who will play there during the World Cup. 

I'm running on a treadmill in a Biodome set up by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park to replicate the extreme conditions England will encounter when they step out to play Italy at the Arena Amazonia on Saturday week.

Outside, the late Spring day is grey and drizzly but this 'Mini-Manaus' feels like a pressure-cooker as industrial-sized heaters relentlessly circulate chokingly hot air.

Welcome refreshment: The cold water is very much necessary after completing the 'Mini-Manaus' challenge

The thermometer reads 31C, the average temperature in Manaus at this time of year, and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark. 

These are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort, so playing 90 minutes of high-intensity football is not an attractive option. 

I manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill, working up from a walk to an all-out sprint, before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great. 

Each match at the World Cup will factor in drinks breaks, and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate.

The paramedic on standby at the Biodome measures my core body temperature at a normal 37.2C before stepping on the treadmill. At the end, it’s nudging above 38C, the kind of level when you’re suffering from a fever. 

It’s a relief to step outside the dome again, into the cooling London drizzle, and I have plenty of sympathy for the England players who will have to cope with these energy-sapping conditions while carrying the weight of the nation’s expectation.
