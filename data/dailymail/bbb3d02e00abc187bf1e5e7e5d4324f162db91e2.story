A woman who left her five-year-old granddaughter in a car for more than an hour while she played the slot machines at a New York casino has been arrested. 

Renee Osby, 56, had  tried to bring her granddaughter into the Resorts World Casino in Queens earlier that day but was told children weren't permitted to be inside.

Osby returned to the casino without the girl and security guards who had seen her with the child became suspicious.

They located the grandmother's car in the parking lot and called police after they found the little girl, named Jordyn, inside, according to the New York Daily News. 

The car was unheated and temperatures were just below freezing. 

When Osby returned an hour later she said she had just gone inside the casino to cash a check. 

But, according to police sources, the grandmother had been playing the slot machines. 

Osby was arrested for acting 'in a manner injurious to a child' under 17 years old. 

Her granddaughter was reunited with her mother. Both live with Osby.  

Resorts World Casino addressed the incident in a statement released Saturday to CBS New York. 

'Earlier today, Resorts World security observed a five-year-old child in an unattended vehicle in the parking lot.

'They were able to safely remove the child from the vehicle and immediately called 911.

'The safety and security of everyone on Resorts World property is our number one priority.'

Security guards at the casino (pictured) became suspicious when they saw Osby return alone and, after locating the girl inside the unheated car in below freezing temperatures, called police
