A 9/11 widow who was paid $1.4 million from the World Trade Center Victim Compensation Fund, is under fire from the son of her late husband, who claims his father’s marriage to the woman was a sham.

Evgueni Kniazev, a Russian waiter at the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World Trade Center, actually paid American Irina Dubenskaya $5,000 to marry him so he could become a legal resident, his son Dennis Vinichenko told the New York Post.

'The relationship was temporary. There was no wedding. There was no wedding band. It was just paper,' the son said. Their actual wedding date wasn't provided but Dubenskaya moved into Kniazev's Brooklyn home in June 2001.

When the man died on September 11, his new wife was the chief recipient of a government payout and the deceased man's children were left with little.

'My father was burned alive,' Vinichenko said. 'This woman was saying she was my family, and then she took all this money. She wasn't really his wife. She was just trying to cash in.'

Kniazev, who came to the U.S. from Russia in 1992, was a waiter at Windows On The World, the 40,000 square foot restaurant on the 107th floor in the North tower at 1 World Trade Center.

He was on duty when the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, crashed into the building at 8.46am on September 11.

The impact hit the structure between the 94th and 98th floors and within seconds, flames and smoke engulfed the complex, trapping those on the floors above. 90 minutes later the tower collapsed.

The attacks on the World Trade Center claimed 2,606 lives, and as a result, the U.S. Congress established the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund to provide for families impacted by the attacks.  

Kenneth Feinberg was appointed to be special master of the fund, working 33 months to estimate how much each victim could have earned in their lifetimes.

At the end of the process, $7 billion was awarded to 97 per cent of the families - with the average payout to individuals being $1.8 million.

Irina Dubenskaya was awarded $1.4 million from the fund and according to a lawyer for her stepson, she did distribute money to both Vinichenko and his sister, who still lives in Russia, as part of a 2004 out-of-court settlement.

'She would have technically been entitled to the whole thing, even though the marriage was a sham,' said Brian Schachter, who was Vinichenko's lawyer in the matter. 'At the time, I thought it was a decent deal.'

The siblings received a total of $150,000, after legal fees, Vinichenko said.

But the stepson now claims he was pressured into agreeing to the settlement by Dubenskaya, who allegedly threatened to turn him into immigration officials since he is a Russian citizen, living illegally in the U.S.

Vinichenko and friends of the late Kniazev have criticized the widow for
using the money she received to pay for college for a son from a 
previous marriage.

'I didn't like the way the money went,' a friend of the late husband, Alexander Teperev, said.

'Her son got to go
to college for free. It wasn't his son. I felt bad about that. The 
money wasn't distributed properly.'

Though he seems to have exhausted all his legal options now, Vinichenko wants to expose his stepmother as a fraud.

‘Money is really secondary,’ he 
said. ‘But there’s real family that exists. What makes me mad is the 
person that took the money is claiming she’s family.’

A friend who had known the couple 
during their short union said that the groom entered into the marriage 
on a '50/50' basis – half to help his legal status in the U.S. and half 
because of his fondness for Irina.

'It was both,' Alexander Teperev said. 'It was business, and he liked her, too.'

Irina herself even seemed to have doubts that love was the motivation for the marriage. 

Wedded bliss? Irina Dubenskaya moved into this Brooklyn home belonging to Evgueni Kniazev in June 2001, months before his death on September 11

'I can't tell if that was Eugene's original intention,' she told the Post, when asked if it was indeed just a green card marriage.

'I thought we had a nice marriage. We started living the American dream life. Then he died,' she added.

Irina maintains that she is in the clear and blames her stepson for not moving on after the tragic loss.

'I have nothing to hide,' she said. 'Dennis got what he was entitled [to]. I respect Eugene. I love him. I just wish he didn’t have a son like that.'
