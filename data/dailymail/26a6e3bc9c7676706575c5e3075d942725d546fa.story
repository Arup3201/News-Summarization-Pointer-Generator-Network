It wasn't meant to be like this.

After a record-breaking Premier League points haul last season, Everton were supposed to pick up where they left off and mount a serious challenge for the top four.

However, things have not gone to plan at Goodison Park. Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Southampton left the Toffees closer to the relegation zone  than those coveted Champions League places.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez has changed the entire outlook of the football club with his positive attitude

Going into Christmas last season, the Blues had lost just one game and were two points off top spot. This season, Everton have already lost six matches and have won just five times in the Premier League.

It's hard to pin-point exactly what has caused Everton's form to drop so considerably over one summer. Second-season syndrome for the manager? The Blues' Europa League campaign? Not enough new additions during the last transfer window? 

Whatever the reason, put simply, Everton haven't reached the high standards the club set themselves during Roberto Martinez's first year on Merseyside.

Everton played some scintilating football last season but have struggled to live up to the high standards set

Points from top spot: 18

Wins: 5

Draws: 6

Defeats: 6

Goals for: 27

Goals conceded: 27

Points from top spot: 2

Wins: 9

Draws: 7

Defeats: 1

Goals for: 29

Goals conceded: 16

Goal difference: +13

One problem - a season-long one - has been Everton's defence. Conceding 10 goals in their first three fixtures was an unexpected setback and the season has failed to lift off since.

The occasional clean sheet has been kept but the performances of an ageing backline have been called into question. The Blues' back five - so miserly in past seasons - has looked a shadow of itself and not at all confident while Tim Howard has failed to repeat his World Cup heroics.

Costly individuals errors - out of Martinez's control - were the main contributing factor for Everton's poor start but the club are yet to recover and languish in mid-table.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, the goals have flowed as freely as before but unlike last year, loan star Romelu Lukaku now has a £28million price tag to live up to.

Paramount to the club moving forward, it was essential Everton made the Belgian's move from Chelsea a permanent one but the striker has much to prove.

The potential to net 20 goals a season is what Lukaku brings to Martinez's side but the 21-year-old must do more to warrant the massive fee Everton paid for his services.

For such a giant of a forward, Lukaku has lacked any real aerial threat, struggled to hold the ball up and, while he still finds the back of the net, his general play has been lethargic.

The blue half of Merseyside attacked with vigour and purpose last season but the scintillating football which delighted the Everton faithful has been missing this term.

Martinez has failed to find a real balance among his front four this term and must find a formation which suits the vast array of attacking talent at his disposal.

Too often this season, Martinez has stuck with Lukaku, Samuel Eto'o, Steven Naismith and Ross Barkley as his front four, but all prefer to play centrally. Lacking any natural width, it appears Martinez is selecting his best individuals rather than his best XI. Square pegs in round holes.

Having arrived at Everton from Wigan in the summer of 2013 to replace David Moyes, Martinez's positive attitude changed the entire outlook of the football club during his first 12 months.

However, this constantly cheery outlook - even after the worst performances - is proving a gripe for some supporters. Rather than praising the players' energy, work-rate and commitment to the cause, the club's support would much rather the Spaniard sometimes admitted: 'We weren't good enough.'

It must be said, Martinez did concede following the defeat at St Mary's: 'We are to blame for the defeat. We were a little bit soft, done too easily with balls into the box. It’s disappointing the way we defended our box,' and will have at least satisfied supporters with his honesty.

Struggling on home soil, the Europa League has provided some solace - Everton playing some blistering attacking football to overcome Wolfsburg, flying-high in the Bundesliga, Lille and Krasnodar to reach the last 32 of the competition - and proves the Toffees still have it; somewhere.

However, Everton fans are desperate to see the club perform to it's maximum potential both at home and abroad.

Luckily, the games come thick and fast during this busy Christmas schedule and provide Everton with a great opportunity to kick start their stuttering season going into 2015.

After last year's achievements, Martinez must show his true credentials as manager by arresting the slide. Everton must act and take advantage of the festive period to save their Premier League season.
