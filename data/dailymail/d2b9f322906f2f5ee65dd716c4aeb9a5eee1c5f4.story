If he had been driving across the American Plains, Jon Maccoll might not have been surprised.

But to be confronted by a stampede of buffalo in the middle of a road in Derbyshire in the early hours, caught him totally off-guard.

He swerved to avoid the animals, which had escaped from a specialist meat farm.

Stampede: Jon Maccoll, of Danesmoor, Derbyshire, who was awarded damages after he was hurt when his car was charged by a herd of buffalo in the Peak District

Damages: Mr Maccoll's Ford Fiesta's back wheels were lifted off the ground when it was hit by the buffalo

But one of them went straight for his Ford Fiesta, which was travelling at 40mph, lifting the back wheels off the ground.

Mr Maccoll suffered neck, shoulder, finger and knee as well as psychological injuries, Sheffield-based solicitors Graysons said.

He eventually secured a settlement of £7,000 for nuisance and common law negligence.

Mr Maccoll, who was driving from Darley Dale to Chesterfield, brought his case under the Animals Act 1971, making a claim against the animal’s owner.

The 44-year-old security manager, from Danesmoor, Derbyshire, said he needed a week off work to recover from his injuries and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after suffering nightmares and flashbacks.

The badly injured buffalo was shot by a police marksman.

‘Most people don’t believe me when I tell them what happened,’ said Mr Maccoll.

‘With it being an animal, it really upset me.’
