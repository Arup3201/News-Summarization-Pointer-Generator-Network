It was business as usual for Andy Murray on the opening day of Wimbledon, as the British No1 began the defence of his men's singles title with a straight-forward victory over David Goffin.

The British No 1 admitted he had been nervous about returning to the court where he so memorably won Olympic gold and became Wimbledon champion, but he showed no signs of anxiety as he brushed aside his diminutive opponent 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 in just over two hours.

Murray said: 'I thought it was a very high standard of match. He was maybe a little bit nervous at the beginning, but the level was very high in the second and third sets. I was glad to finish it in three because he was playing very well.

'Sometimes you can win in three sets and not play well, but I struck the ball well today and it was a good start.

'It
 was nice (to be announced as the defending champion). I was nervous 
this morning and on Sunday and walking to the court brings back lots of 
good memories.

'I got a nice round of applause but now it's time to move onto this year and try to play my best.'

The
 Centre Court crowd's warm, appreciative roar to greet their men's 
champion when he walked out at 1pm provided a moment to savour from a 
British perspective. We have waiting a long time for such a moment, 
after all.

Yet it also 
seemed to overwhelm Goffin, who won the toss but elected to receive and,
 despite earning a break point in the Scot's opening service game, was 
quickly 3-0 down and floundering.

The
 first set was little more than a procession for Murray, who pounced on 
the Goffin serve without relinquishing anything on his own. The Scot has
 never lost to a Belgian or a player ranked outside the top 100 at a 
Grand Slam and apparently had no intention of seeing either record on 
Monday.

Goffin recovered
 his composure slightly in the second set, showing more of the graceful 
elegance that should help him on the grass, but a similar pattern 
continued. Murray raced through his service games and Goffin struggled 
to win his, giving the 23-year-old little chance to recover from going a
 break down early in the set.

By
 the third, however, Goffin had grown in confidence and began to change 
things up, coming into the net and competing more strongly with Murray 
on his own serve. He still made little impact on the British No1's 
serve, but took the set to 5-5 before squandering a 40-15 lead to 
finally give Murray that precious break of serve.

The Scot wrapped up a comprehensive victory with an ace and then a pump of the fist. Now onto the next one.
