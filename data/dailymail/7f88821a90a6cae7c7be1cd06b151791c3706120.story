It's coming up to two years she left her spot on The View after 10 years, amid widespread reports she was  fired.

And it seems Elizabeth Hasselbeck, the co-host of Fox & Friends, is still bitter over how she departed her old stomping ground.

The 37-year-old is set to appear on the Rachael Ray Show on Tuesday, but a teaser of the interview obtained by People shows she doesn't hold back when discussing her time at the panel.

'No. I've done my time,' she said.

'I did my time, I was outta there.'

Never going back: Elizabeth Hasselbeck says on an upcoming episode of the Rachael Ray Show that she has 'done my time' at The View and will not go back

'I was thankful to have the decade that I did there … and, you know what? 

'You break up with me, I'm not going to kiss you!'

Ray was questioning whether Hasselbeck would ever return to the ABC panel, even if just 'for a few days', amid a major shakeup at the show.

Hasselbeck said she does not watch The View anymore and is not aware of the goings-on.

In January, news that new host Rosie Perez was about to be pulled from lineup leaked to the media.

The leak is said to have forced ABC bosses to change their mind about how to handle Perez, who is on contract until August.

Then, on February 6, Rosie O'Donnell abruptly quit.

She said she needed to focus on her family in the wake of the breakdown of her two-year marriage to wife Michelle Rounds.

The 52-year-old married Rounds in June 2012 and the couple adopted a baby daughter named Dakota the following year.

The two split in November, though remain close it seems, with O'Donnell posting a photo of Rounds on her Instagram account on Christmas Eve.

O'Donnell also has daughters Chelsea and Vivienne and son Blake from her first marriage to Kelli Carpenter, and son Parker who she adopted in 1995.

O'Donnell announced in 2009 that Carpenter had moved out two years earlier, and she started dating Rounds in the summer of 2011.

The View's flailing ratings have also called into question the future of the show.

Hasselbeck, meanwhile, left The View in July 2013.

Earlier, in March, inside sources at ABC said she was set to be fired, after viewer polling showed she did not resonate with the audience.

Viewers reportedly thought Hasselbeck was too conservative.

Barbara Walters, then still leading the panel, said at the time the rumors were false.

But ABC announced Hasselbeck was leaving on July 9, and her last day was July 10.

In September 2013 she joined Fox News' Fox & Friends, where she says she remains more than happy.  

'It's a great mix where we are,' Hasselbeck told Ray.

'I have to say, Steve (Doocy) and Brian (Kilmeade) are so funny and interesting and wise and smart. 

'And they take such good care of me.'
