A prison corrections officer is facing multiple charges for allegedly allowing a pair of  strippers to smuggle booze and drugs in to inmates at a Florida jail and brokering  conjugal visits 'in the woods.'

Henry Blackwelder, a former corrections officer at the Pasco County jail, is currently under police investigation for his misconduct.

It is alleged that he used strippers, Jessica Morgan, 24, and Stacy Petty, 46, to get  contraband into prison and would broker 'conjugal visits for inmates in the woods.'

According to police, Blackwelder's operation was exposed after an inmate from the jail escaped from a work crew in suburban Pasco County, 30 miles north of downtown Tampa.

Blackwelder did not tell his superiors of the escape until three hours later and when investigators responded to the prison break they got much more than they bargained for.

Officers uncovered empty cans of Straw-Ber-Rita and Four Loko malt liquor, empty packets of synthetic marijuana known as 'spice,' and a blanket in the woods used for hook-ups.

Sheriff Chris Nocco said: 'Prison is supposed to be tough. ... It was basically a party out there.'

Meanwhile, Morgan told deputies she 'knew it was wrong' but did it because she had fallen in love with one of the inmates on the work crew.

The petite brunette, along with her accomplice, told officials that they had met with the inmates at least once a week for about a year.

The exotic dancers were aided by Blackwelder who was paid with cash and food for the contraband.

Police said he would hide out and finish any leftovers from the food the two women brought for their inmate boyfriends.

'He was like Yogi bear out there eating their leftovers,' Nocco added.

The Sheriff said the investigators were alerted to the misconduct  after inmate Jason Adams - who was serving a six-year sentence for burglary and grand theft - escaped.

Adams managed to sneak away after asking to relieve himself in the woods. But he was caught a day later riding a bicycle. 

Police said Adams would regularly leave the work crew  to buy booze, smokes and spice after Blackwelder gave him permission.

Blackwelder would then get his work crew to smuggle the goods into the prison.  

After the prison escape, the corrections officer immediately resigned. 

On Tuesday, he was charged with official misconduct, unlawful compensation for official behavior and smuggling contraband into a state correctional facility.

He was released on bail a day later. It is not clear if he has an attorney.

Meanwhile, Morgan and Petty have been charged with introducing contraband into a state correctional facility, giving alcohol to an inmate, and giving articles of food and clothing to an inmate. 

They are both being held on $20,000 bond at the Pasco County Jail, and records do not list an attorney for them.

Yet, Nocco noted that the work crew trysts went on even after Blackwelder resigned, leading him to wonder if there are more corrections officers involved.

The state Department of Corrections is currently 'reviewing all policies and procedures related to community work squads to ensure the safety, supervision and security of all inmates and staff.'
