Whilst most beauty pageant contestants spend hundreds of pounds on the perfect dress, a British schoolgirl took home the crown from a glitzy worldwide pageant in America - wearing a £20 dress bought from a rag market.

Alexia Bates, 12, beat more than 30 finalists to add the Perfect Pageants title to her sixteen victories in the UK.

Alexia has won every competition she entered since her first pageant 18 months ago when she was 10-and-a-half.

Winner: Alexia Bates, 12, was crowned the World Pre-Teen Champion at the World Championships in Florida wearing this £20 dress from a rag market

She travelled to Orlando in Florida on August 3 with her mum April Bates, 39, after winning the European leg of the contest earlier this year.

And while most girls wore outfits their parents had splashed out hundreds of pounds on Alexia proudly sported a pink princess dress purchased from an indoor market in Birmingham and decorated with jewels bought off eBay.

And after impressing the judges, the rags-to-riches youngster was crowned the world's perfect pre-teen winning a trophy and $2,000 (£1282).

Alexia's mother April, who lives with Alexia as well as her other daughter Raven, 17, and twin sons Jonah and Noah, five, in Dudley, West Mids., said: 'I'm very proud of her - she has only been competing for the last 18 months.

Pageant princess: Alexia was automatically entered in to the World Championships after winning the European Championships in March of this year, at an event in Porthcawl, Wales

Talent: Alexia has won every single competition she entered since her first pageant 18 months ago when she was 10-and-a-half

Jet setting: She travelled to Orlando in Florida with her mother after winning Europe's perfect pre-teen earlier this year

'Every one she has entered, she has won. She has got a good reputation in the UK and we travel all over the country for pageants.

'Everyone thinks it is all glamorous and expensive but it is what you make it.

'I'm not one who splashes out or wastes money. When it comes to Lexi's outfits, a lot of them are either bought off eBay or we create an outfit of our own.

'For the evening gowns, I will go to the rag market to get the dresses or material and Lexi will draw up what she wants.

'I've got a friend who used to be dress maker who makes them for me and I buy her some flowers to say thanks.

'For her evening gown for America I paid £20 for the dress and bought some diamantes for £25 from eBay.'

Alexia impressed judges in rounds including summer wear and formal wear - as well as shining during the interview stage

Alexia at the Glitz Sparkle 2012 competition - one of the first American style beauty pageants to be held in the UK, which was hailed by children's charities as 'disturbing'

While pageants have traditionally been a
purely American phenomenon, with competitions across the States 
regularly filmed for downmarket reality shows such as Toddlers And 
Tiaras, they are becoming increasingly common in Britain.

The trend has attracted criticism from parenting groups and children's charities about the sexualisation of children.

The director of children's charity 
Kidscape, Claude Knights, warned recently: 'These children are so 
young, it's impossible for them to be giving their consent to wearing 
swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses, as well as fake eyelashes and spray
tans.'

And Alexia took part in the controversial Miss Glitz Sparkle pageant, which saw children as young as 20 months participating.

While organisers hailed the pageant as a great success, child welfare groups criticised it for encouraging the ‘over-sexualisation’ of young girls.

Claude Knights, director of child protection charity Kidscape, described the pageants as a 'disturbing trend', adding: 'It’s impossible for some of these kids to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans.'

But Alexia's mother insists that far from damaging her 
daughter, entering the pageant has been a positive experience.

There has been a lot of criticism regarding the pageant phenomenon with children's charities arguing that it sexualises children

And the teaching assistant said she disagrees with the negative publicity normally associated with the controversial competitions.

She added: 'I think a lot of criticism comes from people who are only basing it from shows they see with the little girls.

'I agree with the little ones because I don't think it's right to put a two-year-old in fake tan or fake eyelashes.

'Lexi does wear make-up but it is age appropriate. She doesn't wear it normally or every day.

Inspired: The contests have inspired Alexia to become a fashion designer

Confidence boost: Her mother says that Alexia has had a real confidence boost and made some great friends by entering the pageants

'She will put a bit of lip gloss on if she is going out for a family meal or to the cinema but she doesn't cake it on.

'For the pageants obviously the make-up has to be a bit more because it's on a stage so it's the same as if it was in the theatre.

'But everything has to go by me and if I'm not happy then I won't allow her to wear it. I wouldn't let her go out wearing what my 17-year-old wears.'

Alexia has also won a modelling contract and a photoshoot as part of her prize but April says they only enter pageants if they have time.

The pageants have even inspired Alexia 
to want to become a fashion designer when she grows up and April maintains that they have improved her confidence.

Lexi said: 'My favourite part of them is meeting up with friends and making new ones and dressing up and spending time with my mom'

The single mother added: 'She has never been big-headed or let it get to her head for all the things she has won.

'If there is a pageant coming up I will ask Lexi if she wants to go and if we have nothing on then we will go.

'I never forced her. She has made friends with other pageant girls and it has improved her confidence.'

Lexi said: 'My favourite part of them is meeting up with friends and making new ones and dressing up and spending time with my mom.

'I practice with my mom in the front room or if I am doing talent or have a routine we make it up together then I practice in my room as well as in the front with my mom whenever I have spare time.

'It gives me lots of confidence and I feel good and its good because we do things for different charities or help people.'
