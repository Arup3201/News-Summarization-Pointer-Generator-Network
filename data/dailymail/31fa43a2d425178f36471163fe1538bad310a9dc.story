Police have described the chilling moment they found a father and his baby son shot to death in a car on Wednesday night in an apparent ambush.

The seventh-month-old boy had been shot in the side of the head.

Authorities are still searching for the gunman behind the double shooting, which occurred on the Crescent City Connection, one of New Orleans' main Mississippi River crossing bridges.

The victims have been identified as Deshawn Butler, 25, and his son Deshawn Kinard, seven months.

Riddled: The damaged sedan that the victims were in at the time is covered in bullet holes. The back window was also blown out

The incident began in the 2100 block of General de Gaulle Drive about 9pm.

Detectives believe the shooter was in a dark-colored vehicle, possibly an SUV, and began firing at a black Honda.

Police said two females were in the front seats while Deshawn and Deshawn Jr were in the back.

The father was shot multiple times and the infant was shot in the left side of the head while sitting inside of a blue plaid car seat.

The infant was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead soon after arriving.

The 25-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver and passenger were unharmed.

Police are working to identify the shooter who opened fire on a car, killing a father and infant near the Crescent City Connection Wednesday night.

Officials are still to determine why the car stopped near the Crescent City Connection bridge toll plaza.

They are investigating whether a second shooting occurred.

The Times Picayune newspaper reported that the victim knew his shooter and that the homicide was not random.

The father of Deshawn Sr, Terry Smith, said he is devastated and this his son was in the 'wrong crowd'.

'I am just so distraught over the death of my son and grandson,' he said.

'Deshawn
got into the wrong crowd.

'It's just a senseless killing.

'I don't know 
what's behind it.'

NOPD Superintendent Ronal Serpas said the scene was 'heartbreaking'.

'I've been crossing under yellow tape for decades, and it's difficult and disturbing every single time,' he said.

'But it was heartbreaking to see what was clearly a bullet hole in the side of a babyâ€™s car seat.

Police say the shooting began here, in the 2100 block of General de Gaulle Drive, about 9pm Wednesday. Detectives believe a shooter in a dark-colored vehicle, possibly an SUV, began firing at a black Honda sedan

'No family should have to endure the murder of a 7-month-old baby.'

Superintendent Serpas urged people to call Crimestoppers.

'We need people who know something about this to call us,' he said.

'It's the decent thing to do.

'It's the right thing to do.'

No arrests have been made.

Crimestoppers can be reached at 822-1111.
