Heavily armed soldiers inspect the room where an explosion occurred at Traders Hotel in central Rangoon late last night

A female American tourist has been rushed to hospital with wounds to her thigh and hand after a time bomb blew up in her room just before midnight yesterday.

The 43-year-old woman had just arrived in the room with her family at the five-star Traders Hotel in central Rangoon, Burma.          

The bomb was attached to a clock in the bathroom and was designed to go off when the next guests checked in to the ninth floor apartment.

The woman's husband and their two children, aged five and seven, 'miraculously' escaped injury, said officials.

It is understood the family were all in the main hotel room when the explosion occurred.           

The explosion was powerful enough to blast toiletries and a purse into the entrance hall, rip a wardrobe door from its hinges and blow out windows, showering the street below with glass.

Police said today that they had detained three men in connection with the bombing, including a 27-year-old man who had previously stayed in the room.

'It is still too early to say it was he who planted the bomb without further investigations,' said a police official.           

The American woman, who has not been named, was deeply shocked, said officials, but her condition was improving.         

'We're still investigating and it's an ongoing process,' said Police Lieutenant General Min Aung of the intelligence and security department.         

The hotel, part of the luxury Shangri-La group, is located in the heart of the city and is popular with foreign tourists and visiting business people.

Miss Lori Lincoln, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong-based hotel group, said staff were working closely with police.

'Our priority right now is to look after the guest that was injured and the guest's family and to assist the police with their investigation.'

The 22-storey, five-star hotel is popular with visiting tourists and business people but is now filled with armed soldiers and police

The explosion earlier today was powerful enough to shatter the room's windows, sending glass into the street

A dozen police and heavily armed soldiers
with a sniffer dog entered the glitzy hotel soon after the explosion.

Later, many of them crowded into the destroyed room, blocked off with 
yellow security tape, to inspect the damage.

Others carrying assault rifles and wearing bullet proof vests strolled through the main lobby.

Sarah Hutchison, the U.S. Embassy press officer, told The Telegraph: 'Our consular officers in Rangoon (Yangon) have visited the U.S. citizen and are providing appropriate consular assistance,' but refused to comment further.

Mysterious explosions in other parts of the country have resulted in two other suspects being detained for questioning, said police.

Last Friday a man and a woman were killed and another person injured when a bomb went off at a guest house in the town of Taunggu.

Two other devices exploded in Rangoon 
on Sunday - one at a bus stop and another under a truck. Two teenagers 
were injured in the truck blast.           

In
yet more terror attacks, two makeshift devices were found in Rangoon 
and in the city of Mandaly on Monday, and earlier today blasts occurred 
at a restaurant and near a pagoda in the north western region of 
Sagaing.    

Police have arrested a 27-year-old man who was the last person to stay in the room before the victim and her family arrived along with two other suspects

Officers say it is a miracle that the woman's husband and two children, aged five and seven, were not hurt

It is not known if the blasts are linked, but officials said groups determined to derail democratic reforms could be behind them as the country prepares to host a major regional sporting event and a meeting of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.           

Alarmed at a time bomb being left in a hotel room, Presidential spokesman Ye Htut said the blasts were intended to spread fear.          

''This is being done too make people worried and scared' said Mr Htut.          

'It is being done to make the international community misunderstand the situation and peace in Myanmar' he told Radio Free Asia's Myanmar Service.           

Government officials fear that as news spreads about a time bomb being left in a hotel room, tourist numbers will drop.

As alarm began to spread that terrorists were mounting a campaign to upend the ASEAN conference, police urged the public to keep their eyes open for any suspicious packages, particularly in market places, bus stops and railway stations.
