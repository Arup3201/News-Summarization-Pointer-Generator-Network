The last thing Sydney drivers want is another distraction on the road.

New plans to raise revenue by selling ad space on roads will go ahead for six months on Parramatta's busiest street but critics say it will be six months of dangerous distraction.

Parramatta Council have approved a six month trial from Road Ads to paint two advertisement signs on Argyle Street near the Westfield shopping centre.

The idea was previously done in Bombala on the south coast of NSW and Mayor Bob Stewart said it was a great success and helped raised revenue

The plan was not supported by police and Roads and Maritime Services but a Parramatta Council spokesman said the six-month trial will see whether the concept has any merit.

'Safety is our top priority. We want to reduce the financial burden on our ratepayers and it makes sense to at least consider new funding sources,' the spokesman said.

Australian company Road Ads have been lobbying local councils to license the idea and companies will bid for the road space at $4000 per ad.

Ads will not be painted near traffic lights, black spots or 'decision-making zones' and will only contain brand logo with no contact details or any signalling to traffic.

Lord Mayor John Chedid told The Sun that the company was 'certified by the government' and offered Parramatta a 'perfect opportunity.'

'We could get $50,000 within two months if the model works and it's safe. I think we should trial it on every road in our local government area,' Mr Chedid said.

Road Ads spokesman Caleb Myers said the plan was to apply 'simple' and 'iconic logos' to road surfaces

The idea was previously done in Bombala of south coast NSW, with a population of just over 1000 people.

Bombala Mayor Bob Stewart told the Daily Mail Australia that the ads were a great success and helped raise revenue for the community.

'It's a great economic infrastructure. We managed to raise $10,000 from it and the money was put towards a walking track by the river,' Mr Stewart said.

'There were a lot of safety concerns before it went forward but we have had no issues and I don't think we've had any accidents.

'We don't have the same traffic volume as Parramatta but I think it's great that they've jumped on board with the idea. It would be silly not to take that opportunity.'

Road Ads spokesman Caleb Myers said the plan was to apply 'simple' and 'iconic logos' to road surfaces.

'Roads have always been a source of cost, our process will for the first time turn council roads into a source of revenue,' Mr Myers said.
