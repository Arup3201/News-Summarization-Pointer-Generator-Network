The boyfriend of the mother of a five-year-old Massachusetts boy arrested over his September disappearance reported only this month has been denied bail.

Alberto Sierra, 22, was denied bail during a Tuesday court appearance to answer charges related to the disappearance of Jeremiah Oliver. Mother Elsa Oliver, 28, was granted bail, but faces a psychiatric evaluation to determine her mental competency.

The Fitchburg couple faces multiple felony charges each related to their missing son, who was last seen by family members in September.

Gone missing: Jeremiah hasn't been seen since September

Mr Sierra made no attempt to contest the denial of bail, but all documents and evidence related to the case has been sealed - leaving yet another mystery in the already mysterious disappearance of young Jeremiah.

The prosecutors contended he was a danger to society, something backed up by reports of previous domestic violence incidents and claims to MailOnline from a person close to the situation that he previously made violent threats against the family of an ex-girlfriend.

The person, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals in the community, confirmed reports Mr Sierra was violent in previous relationships and also spoke of him violating a restraining order.

The source also said he would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion.

Mr Sierra is not known to have been a heavy drinker or drug user, the person noted.

Ms Oliver's bail was set at $100,000. It is not clear if she can reach that amount, but she will have to meet multiple conditions beyond just paying up.

Those include wearing a monitoring bracelet on her ankle, resolving a contempt case in juvenile court and working out mental health issues also previously alluded to MailOnline by the source.

'She doesn't seem to understand what's going on,' Mr Sierra's attorney said of Ms Oliver. 'I've been with her many hours and I can't have a conversation with her.'

The attorney described Ms Oliver as having 'a very flat effect,' which is unusual for the mother of a missing boy.

She is in the midst of a foresnic psychological evaluation, according to the Worcester Telegram & Gazette, which reported that she faces several charges once it is completed January 10.

They include assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

The assault with a belt charges likely stem from earlier reported abuse the child suffered at the hands of both her and Mr Sierra, but officials are remaining tight-lipped about the case.

Young Jeremiah is feared dead, and Mr Sierra has been hit with multiple felony charges that come just short of murder.

The violent man was arraigned earlier this 
month on two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon 
(knife) and two counts of assault and battery on a child causing bodily 
injury.

Family told officials the last time they saw the young boy was September 14, but the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office was only notified within the last two weeks.

Investigators are also canvassing area tattoo parlors about a tattoo the detached mother has of a butterfly and the date Sept. 25, 2013, the Telegram & Gazette reported.

They want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant.

It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah Oliver’s disappearance.

About 30 people attended the court hearing in support of father Jose Oliver - who lives in New Britain, CT. It is not clear how involved he was in the boy's life prior to the disappearance, but he was at Tuesday's hearing.

'The cops are doing a good job,' the devastated father told reporters gathered outside the courthouse. 'Let them do their job. I just want to find my son. That is all.'

Edward Valcourt of Worcester, Jose Oliver's cousin, wore a sweatshirt with a picture of the boy he lost saw two years ago. It also had the words 'Prayers for Jeremiah.'

'He was a wonderful little boy, as happy as could be,' said Mr Valcourt. 'It's just awful thinking of him lying somewhere.'

'The first question that should have been asked is where is that little boy,' the family friend added. 'If they don't want to give up the kid they should be tried for murder.'

Locals plan to continue searches for the missing boy.

'We're going to keep doing the search until we find him' said Jackie Serrano, of Fitchburg. Her 5-year-old son was in Jeremiah's class.

'That boy doesn't deserve to be like this,' she added. 'That boy deserves to be with his dad for Christmas.'

As for the other two children Jose Oliver has with his ex-wife, there is a custody hearing scheduled for December 31.

It is not clear if officials believe the boy is still alive. He is about 40 inches tall and weighs about 40 pounds, they said.

No further information has been released.

Officials urge anyone with information about Jeremiah Oliver to call the numbers on the missing poster.
