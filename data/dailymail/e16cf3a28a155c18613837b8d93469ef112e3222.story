North Korea has convicted and executed three people for cannibalism  as the country continues to struggle with widespread hunger, according to a think tank's new report.

The claims have been made by the South Korean state-run Korean Institute for National Unification.

It’s white paper on human rights outlines information from 230 defectors who reported seeing the public executions which had been carried out since 2006.

The report was reviewed by the Yonhap News Agency which said some of those interviewed claimed the executions were for eating or selling human flesh.

Authorities executed one man for killing and eating parts of a co-worker then trying to sell the rest at a market as mutton.

Widespread food shortages forced another to kill and eat a girl three years ago in Hyesan, Yonhap reported.

A third incident of cannibalism was reported in 2011, but researchers were unable to uncover more details.

Yonhap could not verify the allegations because of strict clampdowns on information coming from the North Korea, according to Global Post.

The internationally isolated country has long battled food shortages, especially after an attempt to reform its currency in 2009.

A North Korean official who defected in 2001 said about a dozen incidents of cannibalism surfaced in that country as far back as 1999.

The allegations of cannibalism followed a huge famine in the late 1990s killed two million people.

Renewed reports of cannibalism come after another human rights group accused North Korea of operating a system of secret gulag-style prison camps, The Associated Press reported.As many as 200,000 political prisoners occupy the camps, said the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea based in Washington, DC.Based on satellite imagery and interviews with escapees and former guards, the committee said entire families are sometimes imprisoned for the political crimes of one person.The North Korean government denies the prisons exist, the AP reported.

The country has been led by Kim Jong Un, who took over after his father Kim Jung Il's death in December.

In April he organised a bizarre tribute to his grandfather Kim Il Sung, who founded the nation.

A huge parade, which was visible from space, was held through the capital Pyongyang to celebrate what would have been Kim Il Sung's 100th birthday.
