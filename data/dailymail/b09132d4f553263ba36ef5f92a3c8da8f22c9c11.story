David Cameron has spoken candidly about his family life and even his first celebrity crush, when he used to have a poster of supermodel Cheryl Tiegs on his wall.

The Prime Minister revealed he had the iconic 1978 Sports Illustrated poster of the American supermodel in a pink bikini on his wall when he was younger.

When asked about his first celebrity crush during an interview with Carol Vorderman for Tesco Magazine, Mr Cameron said: 'I’m afraid, like everyone else, I think I had that poster of Cheryl Tiegs on my wall.'

Asked whether he also had the 'famous Athena poster of the girl playing tennis as well', he replies: 'I probably did.'

to her being his first celebrity crush

Ms Tiegs, now aged 64, responded to Mr Cameron's comments by declaring she had a 'crush' on him and inviting him to meet her.

'Let's meet up': Cheryl Tiegs said she had a crush on Mr Cameron and said they should 'definitely' see each other

'Oh my God! I have a crush on him,' 
she told The Daily Telegraph. 'I think he's so smart and attractive. I 
do love a good British accent. It sort of melts my heart.

'This has caught me by surprise. Cameron and I should definitely meet sometime, just to say ''hey''.'

Mr Cameron 
has talked openly in the interview about his family life, saying he 
plays 'good cop' with the children and loves making rhubarb crumble.

The Prime Minister also spoke of his family’s struggle to deal with the death of his father in 2010.

Mr Cameron was asked about the impact of the unexpected death of his father Ian two years ago on his mother Mary and the family.

'It was a very big shock to everybody, obviously, and to mum, because they were married for more than 46 years,' he said.

'I think mum still feels lonely. But the good thing is that she’s got lots of grandchildren. She’s a pretty active granny. If you want any support with childcare, you’ve got to book in pretty early.'

Mr Cameron said he and wife Samantha sometimes used the 'good cop, bad cop' routine to help control their son Elwen, six, and daughter Florence, who is nearly two.

'I’m usually the good cop,' he said. 'Sam’s brilliant at just playing with the children and having a great time.

'I’m more of a typical dad - let’s go and plant the vegetables, let’s go on a cycle ride, or let’s do a structured activity. My biggest obsession with the kids is cooking. It’s brilliant.'

Mr Cameron went on: 'I do a lot of cooking anyway but I’ve got into more child-friendly cooking such as pancakes, baking, rhubarb crumble - anything that involves getting messy and licking the bowl.

'As a kid, that was always the most exciting thing.'

The premier praised his high-flying wife as 'super-organised' and said he tries to spend lunchtime with the family in the flat above Downing Street.

'I know if I spend time with Florence, I get more out of her,' he said. 'She appears when I walk into the flat and pats the sofa, as if to say ‘now, sit down, don’t just come up here and eat your lunch’.'

'She’s worried I’m going to rush in and out, which is what I often have to do.

'I think a framework is also important. I
do believe in structure - if children know what’s expected of them in 
terms of how to behave, how to eat, what time bedtime is, it works. 
Routine, structure, boundaries.'

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron has appealed for voters in tomorrow’s crunch elections not to punish the Tories for Britain’s economic woes.

The Prime Minister urged people to focus on local rather than national issues in the wake of a turbulent spell for the coalition.

As parties mounted a final push before the polls open, Ed Miliband promised that Labour would 'stand up for the many' rather than the 'rich and powerful'.

Speaking to ITV News in the garden of 10 Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: 'I recognise it’s a difficult time for families, it’s a tough time for families,' he said.

'I just hope that people will look at these elections and recognise it’s about electing your local council - who is going to keep the council tax down, who’s going to provide value for money, who’s going to look after your area?'
