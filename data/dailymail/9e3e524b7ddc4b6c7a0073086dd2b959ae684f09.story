Two teenagers who were killed when their car crashed down a motorway embankment have been named by police.

Destiny James-Keeling, 14, and Megan Marchant, 18, both from Leicester, died when the Vauxhall Astra convertible they were passengers in left the M1 near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on Saturday night.

The driver - a woman aged 35 - and an 18-year-old man both escaped with minor injuries after the car struck trees on the embankment at around 7.15pm, Leicestershire Police said.

A statement released by Destiny's family read: 'Destiny lit up every room she walked in.

'She was a beautiful and loving young woman, full of soul and laughter who lived life to the fullest.

'Destiny was always there to support her friends, her laughter, friendship and huge love has left a huge hole in our hearts.

'Anastasia, Wade and family would like to thank everyone from the bottom of their hearts for all of the overwhelming support, messages and tributes.'

Investigating officer Detective Constable Ady Keeble said: 'This was a tragic incident in which two young girls have sadly lost their lives.

'The car had gone about a mile past the start of the M6, Junction 19, and was travelling M1 northbound on Saturday evening when it left the carriageway and collided with trees on the embankment at the side of the motorway.

'We'd like to appeal to anyone who was driving on the M1 in this area on Saturday evening between 7pm and 7.15pm to contact us.

'The car was quite distinctive because it was a convertible so we'd like to hear from anyone who thinks they saw either the incident or the vehicle being driven beforehand.'

A fundraising page has been set up to raise money for Destiny's funeral which has already raised £2,190.

It says: 'The beautiful Destiny James Keeling was tragically taken from us on the 4th January 2014 at the devastatingly young age of 14. It was a tragic and devasting accident which no one could of prevented or forseen.

'This is a traumatic time for her parents and anyone who knows or loves destiny and to take the financial burden from them all at this terrible time we please ask for everyones help.

'Any donation big or small will help contribute towards the cost of young Destiny's funeral.'
