Singer, presenter and Britain's Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon added another string to her bow recently, becoming a mother for the first time last October.

Now the stylish 35-year-old has joined forces with Marks and Spencer and Oxfam to launch the 'Shwop Boutique', a pop-up children's clothing shop selling pieces donated by style icons and celebrity mothers.

The Marble Arch pop-up project is part
 of the ‘Love, Mum’ shwopping campaign, seeing shoppers 'shwop' (or donate) an unwanted
 item of clothing to gain entry.

Alesha Dixon and Joanna Lumley are backing the M&S/Oxfam Kids Schwop Boutique

The
 Kids’ Shwop Boutique will stock items priced between 99p and £50 and includes donations by: Rachel Weisz, 
Rochelle Humes, Peaches Geldof, Abbey Clancy, Zoe Ball, Fay Ripley, 
Penny Lancaster, Jo Wiley, Mel C, Tess Daly and Sara Cox; as well as 
quality Shwopping items donated by the public.

Over
 2,000 items will be on sale across the three days with all money raised
 going directly to Oxfam’s Mother Appeal - aiming to raise over £10 
million for projects that help mothers around the world lift themselves 
and their families out of poverty for good.

Alesha, whose daughter Azura is just four-months-old said: 'As a new mum I’m conscious of how lucky I am, but also of how hard it can be for those who are bringing up children in tough conditions; where things like food, water and basic healthcare aren’t guaranteed.

Looking smart at the event in a suit and nude heels she added: 'I’m proud to be involved in the launch of the Kids’ Shwop Boutique today, there’s so many clothes here I want to buy for my little one, and want to encourage mums and grandmas across the UK to continue to help the cause by delving into the back of their wardrobes and pulling out old and unworn items of clothing which can be Shwopped. By taking these items to M&S stores nationwide we can raise money for Oxfam's Mother Appeal and all play a part in helping mums worldwide lift themselves and their families out of poverty.'

Joanna Lumley said of her support for the campaign: 'It is a strange but true fact that the smaller the human being, the more clothes they inevitably need. Our children grow so quickly that the clothes we bought a week ago are often too small to be worn again. Yet, we are often guilty of throwing these away or holding onto them as they hold emotional memories for us as new mums.'Through Shwopping we can now help mums that we may never meet, but through that old babygro that will never be worn again, we can be connected through our memories and our goodwill.

'No clothing, no matter how small, should end up in landfill and harm the environment. Dig deep into the back of the wardrobe, get that box from the cellar and schwop them… your small donation will have a huge impact on someone’s life.'

Alesha's daughter Azura was born in March 2014

Marks & Spencer and Oxfam’s Kids’ Shop Boutique is open 10am – 9pm on Thursday 6th March and 9am – 9pm on Friday 7th & Saturday 8th March.
