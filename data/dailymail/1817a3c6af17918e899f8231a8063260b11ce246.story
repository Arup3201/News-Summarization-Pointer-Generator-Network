Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas believes Carlo Ancelotti's current side could be the best he has played in during his time in the first team.

The Spanish stopper has been part of Real's senior set-up for 15 years, winning five La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies.

But after beating Granada 4-0 to move to the top of the table on Saturday, Casillas thinks Los Blancos may be the strongest they've been since at least 1999.

Speaking after Real's 11th successive win in all competitions, Casillas said: 'The current Real Madrid team is one that began to be built up during last season when we managed to win the European Cup and the Copa del Rey.

'We have excellent players. Some have had to leave us, though they were important to us, but other players have come in and they have adapted well and are bringing in positive results.

'This could be the best Real Madrid side I've played in and hopefully by the end of the season we'll have won some big competitions.'

Ancelotti's men jumped above rivals Barcelona with victory against Granada but Sevilla can move to the summit of La Liga if they beat Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.

With champions Atletico Madrid and Valencia also in the mix at the top of the division, Casillas believes La Liga is benefiting from increased competition this season.

'It's great from the competitive point of view. In other years it was just a straight fight between Real Madrid and Barcelona,' he added.

'But then Atletico joined in and now there are five or six teams up there.'
