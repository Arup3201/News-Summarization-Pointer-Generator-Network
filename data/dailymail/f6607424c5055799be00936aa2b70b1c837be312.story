When pretty Drew-Ashlyn Cunningham steps into the wrestling ring her male opponents may be taken aback.

But, despite her feminine looks and curves, 
the 5ft 11in, 57kg stunner packs a serious punch when she fights under her alter ego, Harley Ryder.

The 34C beauty is in fact the UK's only transgender wrestler and, after months of training, is preparing to take on the men in her first wrestling matches.

Drew-Ashlyn always felt there was something different about him as a young boy (left) and, after transitioning from man to woman in 2007, chose to pursue his dream of becoming a female wrestler (right)

At 5ft 11 and with a 34C bra size, Drew-Ashlyn's feminine appearance doesn't detract from her performance in the ring

The 24-year-old was so obsessed with 
female wrestlers when she was a teenager that she decided to become one -
despite having been born a boy.

She said: 'Wrestling has always been a passion of mine and I grew up with it for many years. I’ve been inspired by Lita from WWE, she was my idol as a wrestler and it’s who I want to be like.'

Drew-Ashlyn changed from man to woman after telling doctors she was trapped in the wrong body as a teen.

It encouraged her to pursue her dream of becoming a wrestler after idolising women in the sport throughout her childhood.

The make-up artist, who works in Leeds, was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 18 after telling doctors how she felt about her body

And for the last three months, she has been in the ring training as a wrestler and is now preparing for her first fight.

Drew-Ashlyn, from Wakefield, admits: 'It is tough. I come away with lots of bumps and bruises but at the end of the day if it’s not in your heart you’re not going to make it.

'I think it takes a strange breed of person to get into this business. You have to be a bit different to jump into a ring and say ‘I’m going to beat myself up today.’ 

She continued: 'The men are very comfortable with me. They’re all nice and make sure they care for me. Every time they give me a move they will ask me if I am OK. They do make sure I am in safe hands.

'It’s not an issue for them. The guys are really supportive and in a way it’s really surprising because that world, the wrestling world, can be masculine and macho.'

Drew-Ashlyn has struggled with her transition into a woman; being bullied and suffering with depression

She trains for hours a week with professional wrestling company, UK Wrestling, completing thousands of press-ups, sit-ups, running intense drills and now manages routines for other wrestlers.

'We do a huge workout at the beginning of the session,' she said.

'Then we do a lot of moves. We learnt how to take a backdrop and how to land on the mats because when you fall back, you hurt you back and you’ve got to know how to do it properly.'

Drew-Ashlyn, who appeared on the hit reality show ‘My Transexual Summer,’ started her transition to a woman in 2007.

The make-up artist, who works in Leeds, was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 18.

The condition leaves sufferers feeling there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity.

The journey from man to woman hasn’t been an easy one for her. She battled with depression, self-harming and was abused in the street by strangers.

She said: 'I used to get bullied a lot. People would shout at me in the street just randomly, saying that I looked like a man or yelling ‘tranny’ - just really horrible things. I didn’t look like I do back then. I had braces, my hair was white and I didn’t know how to do my make-up.

'Because my childhood was quite open I never understood why I was getting bullied. People would always put me down and call me gay and poof.

'I used to stop myself from eating and starve myself and hope that I wouldn’t wake up and hope that I would die in my sleep.

'I used to play with Barbie dolls and dress up but because my family was really open minded, no one questioned my behaviour and so I didn’t question it myself.

'When I was eight or nine years old that’s when I really got this feeling that I was trapped in the wrong body.'

She admits she was apprehensive about joining the masculine world of wrestling at first.

'I rang them up and explained that I wanted to get into wrestling but that I was very nervous because of being transgender and that I know it is a very male-orientated environment,' she explained.

'I was quite scared about being in that situation where it is hands on and you’re with the guys and I was worrying about that.'

The wrestler, who has never revealed her former male name, has been taking hormone supplements for the last three years and with the help of a padded bra is now happy with her new look.

'I’m quite lucky in terms of the way I look but I’m planning on a couple of surgeries. I want a couple on my face so it’s kind of a lengthy process but I’m quite happy now,' she said.

'The things that I would like are kind of cosmetic. Hopefully by the time I’m 30 I will be fully complete.

'It has been an amazing journey for me. It’s been a crazy experience and I am very thankful.'
