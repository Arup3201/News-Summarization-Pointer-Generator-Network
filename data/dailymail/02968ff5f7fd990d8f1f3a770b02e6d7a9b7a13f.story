War rationing was a way of life during World War Two, creating  a national culture of austerity, but it also sparked ingenuity, such as swapping an ice-cream for a carrot on a stick.

It was the official wartime 
substitute for ice-cream, and some British children born just before 
the war didn’t discover what ice-cream actually was until the fighting had finished and rationing stopped.

The carrot on a stick was offered as the alternative when supplies ran low, because sugar needed to make ice-cream was one of the first luxuries to be hit on rationing, along with bacon and butter.

In this heart-warming video, a pair of toddlers, who are thought to be siblings, can be seen gazing at a hand-drawn sign advertising ice lollies for '1d'- which was pennies in the currency of the 1940s.

But the words are crossed through and instead carrots on a stick are offered.

The pair toddle into the shop and are later seen happily sitting on the grass, joined by a friend, enjoying their healthy snacks.

The newsreel Easter on the Homefront was originally titled Easter 1941 and compares the British holiday season during the war to before it began.

It was issued that year in newsreel cinemas around Britain and on RAF bases.

The video highlights the fact that London railway terminals are becoming desolate, 'due to that nasty piece of work from Germany,' says the voiceover, referring to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

It also features people holidaying at home or in bordering counties, paddling in village ponds and enjoying walks along the promenade.

A spokesperson for British Pathé said: 'British Pathé took it upon themselves to suggest war-time holiday alternatives to the British public. As well as their quaint Easter time clip on they issued a fun mini-series in 1941 called Holidays At Home This Year which suggested affordable summer activities for families.'
