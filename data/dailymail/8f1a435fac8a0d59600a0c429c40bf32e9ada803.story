Wayne Rooney claims he is ready for the Manchester United captaincy as he prepares to work under new manager Louis van Gaal.

United are looking for a skipper after the departures of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, plus Ryan Giggs’s decision to become Van Gaal’s assistant next season.

Rooney, who has captained England and United in the past, said: ‘I do feel I’m ready for it but it’s the manager’s decision.

Wearing the armband: Rooney has been United captain on occasion in the past, such as the Champions League match against FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford in October 2006

‘I’ve said before that I’ve captained United a few times and to get it on a  full-time basis would be great. But obviously with the new manager coming in, it’s his decision. Whoever he chooses to be captain, I’ll respect that and have no problems with it.

‘If he chooses someone else then honestly I’ve got no problems with that. I’ll respect his decision. Robin van Persie (above) is captain of his country, he’s captained Arsenal and if Robin gets the nod then I’m sure he’ll do a great job. It is going to be an exciting time at the club.’
