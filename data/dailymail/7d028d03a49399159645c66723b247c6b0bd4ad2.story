The two bakers at the centre of the Great British Bake Off row will be reunited in the programme’s final episode in October, the BBC confirmed yesterday.

Iain Watters and Diana Beard have insisted there are ‘no hard feelings’ between them following the ‘bingate’ row, in which the latter was accused of sabotaging her rival’s baked Alaska.

Mr Watters became the losing baker in the episode after yelling in frustration and presenting his melted ice-cream pudding to the judges from a bin. His exit triggered a storm of criticism among viewers, and the BBC has received 800 complaints about the episode which aired this week.

Mrs Beard, 69, will also take no further part in the competition after a head injury left her with no sense of smell.

But the pair will be seen together in the show’s traditional finale reunion. Yesterday one of last year’s Bake Off finalists Ruby Tandoh waded in to the row, blaming the show’s editors for making Mr Watters’s meltdown look worse than it really was in a bid to boost ratings.

The hit BBC1 programme has been embroiled in a furore after it appeared to show Mrs Beard taking her rival’s baked Alaska out of the freezer and leaving it to melt. Show host Sue Perkins insisted there had been ‘no sabotage’.

Mrs Beard blamed the BBC for editing the programme to make her look like the culprit, and said the cake had been out of the freezer for no more than 40 seconds.

Miss Tandoh, who was at the heart of her own Bake Off storm last year when viewers accused her of trying to flirt her way to victory, agreed. She said: ‘If there was nastiness in the tent this week, it came in the form of making a humiliated Iain parade the dustbin to the judge’s table.

‘Nastiness was spinning a story that cast an old lady as a pantomime villain.’

Miss Tandoh also criticised viewers for their Twitter ‘hate campaign’ against Mrs Beard, saying: ‘Shame on the online lynch mobs.’

It is the first year Bake Off has been shown on BBC1, and it has seen ratings soar as a result. But an insider said yesterday: ‘The danger is the makers try to turn it into a prime-time reality show like X Factor by exaggerating the drama.

‘It started out as a gentle baking show, but it is building into a juggernaut. The format seems to be getting bigger than the individual contestants.’

Mr Watters, who appeared on Newsnight on Thursday, was magnanimous in defeat and refused to blame Mrs Beard for his exit.
