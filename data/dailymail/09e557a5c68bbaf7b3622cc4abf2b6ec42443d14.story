Brilliant disguises they certainly weren’t.

But these laughable faces pulled by a gang of fraudsters helped them con banks out of up to £10million.

The mugshots were used to create dozens of fake passports and driving licences which enabled the men to open accounts in false names. Once they’d successfully applied for loans and overdrafts, they simply pocketed the cash and disappeared.

Master of disguise: Fraudster Anthony Bridger pulled a variety of bizarre faces in passport photos in a bid to defraud banks of around £1.5million

Payback: Bridger has been ordered to repay £1.28million within six months or face six more years in jail

In one picture, gang leader Anthony 
Bridger, 53, who owned a villa in the Cayman Islands and an apartment in
Monto Carlo, tried to change his appearance simply by blowing out his 
cheeks.

More than 200 images of Bridger trying
out different expressions were unearthed when police raided his 
offices. At the offices of another gang leader, David Tunnicliffe, 38, 
officers found four bogus passports and 26 driving licences all bearing 
his photograph.

They also recovered 26 birth certificates and numerous ‘deed poll documents’.

The group were given varying jail 
terms for their part in the scam but this week Bridger was the subject 
of a hearing at Southwark Crown Court to recover some of the £1.5million
cash he raked in.

He was jailed for four years and eight
months in 2011 for masterminding the con but was ordered to pay back 
£1,280,000 within six months or face an additional six years.

The court heard the gang ran the bank 
accounts as if they were owned by real people, making transactions and 
paying in what looked like high salaries in order to build up good 
credit ratings.

But they would then apply for an overdraft or loan and bleed the accounts dry, before moving on to other victims.

Jailed: David Tunnicliffe was jailed for five years for his part in the scam from which he is thought to have made £2million

Prosecutor David Levy said: ‘This methodology was applied and there was a continuous stream of criminality, it was ongoing.’

He said the fraud was carried out as a ‘businesslike venture’ between 2003 and 2010.

The fraud came to light when banks 
including Lloyds TSB, Nat West, Barclays and HSBC  realised they were 
losing huge sums of money and contacted the police.

Tunnicliffe and Bridger, both of South-West London, were identified as the masterminds after a  14-month investigation.

Tunnicliffe owned a property portfolio
including a villa in Spain and a house in Fulham, but had not paid any 
tax for six years. He made around £2million from the fraud.

Different faces: Tunnicliffe styled his hair differently and wore different glasses in a bid to fool the banks

At Bridger’s office, police found a 
number of mobile phones all adorned with sticky notes giving the bogus 
names that the number belonged to.

He also kept one cheque from each bank account so he had a template of the bogus signature he had used.

Richard Andrews, 41, who was a 
lieutenant in the con, stuffed folders in the oven so officers would not
discover the bogus identity documents in his possession. He earned at 
least £1.2million from the fraud.

Fellow fraudster Jonathan Ainsworth, 
46, who was jailed for 37 months, has been ordered to pay back a total 
of £33,498, including more than £18,000 in compensation to RBS and HSBC.

A confiscation hearing in respect of 
co-defendant Adrian Dubery, who was also jailed for 37 months, was 
adjourned and will take place at a later date to be fixed.

David Barclay, 41, was jailed for two 
and a half years and Megan Smith, 47, for 13 months, while Paul Bridger,
60, received a ten-month prison term suspended for 12 months with 60 
hours of unpaid work, after they all admitted taking part in the scam.
