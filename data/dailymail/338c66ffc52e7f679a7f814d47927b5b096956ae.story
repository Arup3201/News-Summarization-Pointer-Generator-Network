A woman who had her phone snatched in the street was amazed when a stream of photos of teenagers were uploaded on an online photo account.

Jill Johnston, from Derby, was left shaken after she was mugged by a gang as she made her way back from a Guides group where she has been a leader for 24 years.

Distraught Ms Johnston only made the discovery when she realised her photos were automatically beamed to an online cloud.

When Ms Johnston went to retrieve the snaps, she noticed that new photos had started appearing - showing youths posing for pictures

It is not suggested that the people in the photos are connected with the theft

But when she went to retrieve the snaps, she noticed that new photos had started appearing - showing a group of unknown youths posing for pictures.

It is not suggested that the people in the photographs had anything to do with the theft.

The Guides leader said: 'I was so pleased when I remembered my Dropbox account and all my treasured photos.

'But I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the other photos on there.

'I was talking to my mother on the phone as I walked home from a meeting.

'I heard people behind me and stepped to one side and then another couple of them came past me as well.

'When I looked up they had gathered on the corner of the street and I started to feel really uneasy.

'I decided that I would walk the long way round and as I did they just ran at me and grabbed the phone.'

Ms Johnston's phone was equipped with the application and she quickly logged into the account to show her parents that her photos were retrievable.

Ms Johnston told colleagues at Rolls-Royce, where she has worked for 15 years, about the theft. She said: 'Everyone was so supportive and I got letters from people.

'Some of them said I should upload them to Facebook and make it go viral.

'I’ve published them in the hope that somebody might know them or where the photos were taken and the response has been amazing.'

A Derbyshire police spokeswoman confirmed officers were looking into the incident.

She said: 'While we cannot say whether the people in these pictures were part of the theft, we would urge them to contact us to help with our inquiries.'
