Arsene Wenger has told the Arsenal board he needs two signings this month to safeguard the club’s Champions League status.

A new centre back and a defensive midfielder are the positions Wenger wants to strengthen.

The summer sale of Thomas Vermaelen and the shoulder injury sustained by Mathieu Debuchy against Stoke last Sunday have left Arsenal’s defence depleted.

Winston Reid (right) tussles with Alexis Sanchez... and could the pair be lining up on the same side soon?

Reid is seen as the sort of commanding influence which Arsenal's rearguard is so badly missing

West Ham’s Winston Reid is a main target, along with Ipswich youngster Tyrone Mings.

With Jack Wilshere (ankle) and Mikel Arteta (calf) sidelined, Wenger is eager to bolster his midfield, though first-choice Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton won’t be available until the summer.

Arsenal have been offered Atletico Madrid’s Mario Suarez on loan until the end of the season.
