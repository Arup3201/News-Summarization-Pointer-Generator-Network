Charles Blow has written about his anger after his son was held by police at gunpoint on the Yale University campus over the weekend

A journalist has written about his anger after his son was held by police at gunpoint on the Yale University campus over the weekend because he 'fitted the description' of an alleged burglary suspect.

Blow, who is African American, tweeted about the incident on Saturday night when he said he was 'fuming' and also wrote about it in his column in Monday's New York Times.

In his column Blow related his son's version of events, in which the young man – a third year biology major - was accosted by a campus police officer at gunpoint as he left the library.

The officer told Blow's son to get on the ground and then asked a series of questions before he was eventually allowed to go on his way after showing his student ID.

According to Blow, his anger with the situation was not that his son was stopped, but that the officer had been so quick to brandish his weapon.

'What if my son had panicked under the stress, having never had a gun pointed at him before, and made what the officer considered a 'suspicious' movement? Had I come close to losing him? Triggers cannot be unpulled. Bullets cannot be called back,' he wrote.

The journalist, who is also a regular contributor to CNN and MSNBC, has written extensively about the recent deaths of unarmed black men - including Michael Brown and Eric Garner - at the hands of the police.  

Blow's anger was more apparent in a series of tweets posted on Saturday night when used hashtags including '#RacialBattleFatigue', '#BlackLivesMatter' and '#ICan'tBreathe'.

Blow first tweeted his anger about his son's experience on Saturday night before writing a more considered opinion piece in Monday's New York Times

'This is exactly why I have NO PATIENCE for people trying to convince me that the fear these young black men feel is real,' he tweeted. 

In his column on Monday, Blow response was more considered but just as powerful.

'I am reminded of what I have always known, but what some would choose to deny: that there is no way to work your way out — earn your way out — of this sort of crisis,' he wrote. 

'In these moments, what you've done matters less than how you look. There is no amount of respectability that can bend a gun's barrel.'

Blow also writes that Yale's dean has apologized to his son and the actual suspect was also  apprehended.
