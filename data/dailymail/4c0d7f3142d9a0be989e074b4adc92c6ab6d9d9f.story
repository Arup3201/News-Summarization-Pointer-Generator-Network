The chance to get married in a beautiful castle is usually reserved for royalty and is something many can only dream of.

But Kate Stahl, from suburban Sydney, will live the fairytale for real when she ties the knot to her knight in shining armour, Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell, in Germany on Friday.

The 30-year-old had no idea she would live happily ever after as a countess when she met her future husband at a party, aged just 15.

Happily ever after: Kate Stahl will become a countess when she marries Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell on Friday

The pretty blonde Australian, who has swapped her old home on Bobbin Head Rd in Turramurra for Munich to live with Count Faber-Castell, will say her vows at his stunning family home in Stein.

He is the 31-year-old son of Count Andreas-Wilhelm von Faber-Castell, the managing director of one of the world's largest manufacturers of pens, pencils and office supplies.

'Regardless of the surroundings, for me I am so very excited to be marrying my high school sweetheart and best friend,' Ms Stahl, who works in marketing, told the Daily Telegraph.

The pair first met when they were teenagers, when they were both living in Sydney's northern suburbs.

Though he currently lives in Munich to pursue a fish-farming business, Count Faber-Castell's family moved to Australia in 1971, and he was born and raised in Sydney, where he attended the prestigious Knox Grammar School.

Ms Stahl and Count Faber-Castell got together in November 2009, when they both happened to be in the U.S. at the same time. They both currently live in Munich.

She added: 'Becoming a countess does not change who I am as a person.'

But the grand splendour of Count Faber-Castell's castle will surely add some magic to their special day.

The structure, which was first built by Baron Lothar von Faber in the 1840's, boasts endless classically decorated rooms.

Including, a maple wood finish music room, a book-lined gentleman's library, a smoking and games room, a study and a romanesque hall, which is pannelled in dark stained oak.

Then there's the French classically designed Louis Seize drawing room, a tapestry room and a grand dining hall, which seats up to sixty people, to explore.

The loved-up couple have invited 300 guests to an elegant, formal ball on the evening of their big day.

The complex will be decorated in white hydrangeas and Ms Stahl will wear an original dress created by Australian designer Rhonda Hemmingway, who is known for creating perfectly cut, superbly fitted gowns.

Stunning pear-shaped 10-carat diamond earrings worth more than $250,000 will ensure her transformation from Sydneysider to countess is complete.

Ms Stahl is not the first Australian commoner to have caught a royal's eye.

It has been ten years since Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, 45, married Hobart-born Mary Donaldson, 42, the girl he bumped into at a pub in Sydney.

Now the Crown Princess of Denmark, Mary lives in Copenhagen with her husband and their four children HRH Prince Christian, eight, HRH Princess Isabella, seven, and three-year-old twins HRH Prince Vincent and HRH Princess Josephine.

Wilhelm von Faber (1851-1893) is one of the count's ancestors, though Wilhelm was of an artistic bent and not cut out for business. Both his sons died in childhood meaning that the business was passed down to his daughter

Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell comes from a long line of pencil makers, dating back to Kaspar Faber, who  lived in Nuremberg in the mid-18th century.

The pencil maker set up his own business, which he passed on to his son Anton Wilhelm Faber, who built it up into a flourishing factory.

Lothar Faber who took over the company in 1839 at the age of 22, was the first Faber to be elevated to peerage, when he was  granted a life peerage by King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1862.

This recognition was in honour of his social and economic services to the community, which included donating significant funds to one of Germany's first kindergartens, as well as setting up a health insurance scheme, savings bank for his employees, and building them apartments to live in.

His commitment to his employees' welfare so impressed the French emperor Napoleon III, the he sent a delegation to investigate the welfare of Faber's workers and then made him a knight of the Legion d'Honneur.

The family name became Faber-Castell when Lothar von Faber died without a male heir and the business passed on to his granddaughter, Baroness Ottilie von Faber.

Lothar von Faber earned a hereditary peerage from King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1862. He was responsible for expanding the business and for embarking on a program of social improvement

She married Count Alexander zu Castell- Rüdenhausen in 1898, but kept her name, which was one of the conditions of her grandfather's will. This was a very unusual step at the time and required permission royal permission.

The couple became known as the Count and Countess von Faber-Castell, a name which was then transferred to the company.

The business continued to expand and is the oldest family-run manufacturer of writing instruments in the world.

Count Andreas Wilhelm Eberhard von Faber-Castell, the father of the groom, was born in Nuremberg, he moved to Australia in 1971 and is the managing director of Faber-Castell Asia Pacific.

His son, Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell was born in Sydney, and is currently living in Munich where he is working on a fish-farming business.
