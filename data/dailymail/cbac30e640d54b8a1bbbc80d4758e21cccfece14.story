Prince Harry has split from his girlfriend Cressida Bonas only a month after she attended an official engagement with him for the first time.

The couple had embraced in front of cameras, prompting speculation they might be about to get engaged.

But their two-year relationship is said to have become strained in recent weeks, with a report in US magazine People suggesting Miss Bonas had become too ‘needy’ for the royal.

That was strongly denied by sources close to the couple who confirmed their separation to the Daily Mail last night.

The couple were introduced by Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie, who is also a close friend of aspiring actress Miss Bonas

There has been no official confirmation on the split from the palace or from Miss Bonas

A friend insisted that the split was ‘very much an amicable one’ and that they had parted as friends.

‘Unfortunately
 it is true, they have split up. But this suggestion that the prince 
supposedly “dumped” Cressida because she was “too needy” is so wide of 
the mark,’ they said.

‘It is
 a very amicable split and they are still very much the best of friends.
 They have just decided to go their separate ways.’

The
 source said that Miss Bonas, 25, was keen to ‘focus on her career’. She
 recently graduated from the Laban school of dance and is currently 
working for a marketing company in Soho while deciding what to do next.

‘Cressida
 has decided she wants to focus on her career and Harry is really keen 
that she is allowed to get on with her life,’ the friend said.

‘He
 is furious at this suggestion that the split was in any way because she
 was relying too much on him. Cressida is one of the most independent 
people he knows.’

Harry and 
Prince William are believed to be heading to Tennessee this weekend to 
attend the wedding of their close friend Guy Pelly. Pelly, who organised
 William’s stag do, is marrying American-born Lizzy Wilson and has 
reportedly asked the princes to act as ushers.

Another
 source close to Cressida said last night: ‘Cressie is only 25 and 
pretty young for her age at that. Prince Harry will be 30 this year and 
is at a different stage in his life. He is incredibly fond of Cressie 
and understands that she wants to do something with her life and with 
her career before she considers settling down.

‘It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if they got back together in a few months time.’

Still,
 the split has come as a surprise, not least because Miss Bonas was seen
 going into Kensington Palace hand in hand with the prince only last 
week.

Harry and Miss Bonas, 
who met in summer 2012 after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, have 
been more willing to appear in public together in recent months after a 
coy start to their relationship.

In March they were spotted at Twickenham watching England defeat Wales at rugby.

Two
 days earlier they had attended their first official engagement 
together, a charity event at Wembley Arena at which Harry was the star 
speaker.

Royal sources quashed speculation of an imminent engagement after the couple were seen embracing at the event.

But friends of Miss Bonas suggested that her wealthy family had held a summit to discuss the possibility of a royal wedding.

One
 report last night claimed the couple had simply ‘paused for a 
breather’, raising the possibility that they could get back together. 
This would mirror the relationship of William and Kate, who split 
briefly in 2007.

It had been
 thought that Harry was preparing to settle down following his turbulent
 seven-year relationship with Zimbabwe-born Chelsy Davy that ended in 
2011.

On Tuesday Harry was 
reportedly seen on a night out with his friends James Haskell, the 
England rugby star, stockbroker Adam Bidwell, and Viscount Erleigh at a 
Mayfair club.

A Clarence House spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on Prince Harry’s private life.’
