Cesc Fabregas saw the question coming from a hundred yards distance, and his answer was splendidly dismissive. ‘Do we feel invincible?’ he echoed. ‘This is a joke. Arsenal went unbeaten in 2003–4. That will never happen again.’

As a young player at Arsenal during that golden season, Fabregas is eminently qualified to make the judgment. But Chelsea have 22 points from the 24 available. The question will be repeated a time or two.

His manager, Jose Mourinho, has been making the same response for most of October. And yet, after such a start, he is prepared to make cautious noises about the title. ‘If we were in another league, I’d say immediately, “Yes, we will do it”. In the Premier League, we “can” do it. But it’s hard to say we “will” do it. There’s a long way to go. There’s lots of good teams and difficult games in front of us. I’m pleased, but to win the title, it’s a long way away.’

Ratings by JACK GAUGHAN at Selhurst Park

True, all true, but there is something in Chelsea’s attitude which provokes outrageous expectations. It is clear that titles are not won at places like Selhurst Park, although Chelsea might concede that they lost last season’s crown through defeat at Palace. They might also admit that Saturday's victory could have been much more emphatic had Mourinho not insisted on restraint rather than aggression when Palace were there for the taking. Finally, they might agree that their back four is suspiciously vulnerable to genuine pace, which could prove costly against more potent sides than the one they met.

But, after making all those concessions, they will be satisfied with the three points they expected from a strangely eccentric match.

Everything is falling into place for Mourinho’s team. Even when they lost Cesar Azpilicueta to a red card on 40 minutes, Damien Delaney obligingly committed a second bookable offence within two minutes to restore the numerical balance. Chelsea then settled to unchallenged control; good players doing the simple things to emphatic effect.

Oscar’s stunning free- kick had given them the lead within six minutes, and when Fabregas drove in the second soon after the interval, their task seemed blessedly simple.

And yet control did not yield further goals, and they endured the closing moments in a state of something akin to panic, when Palace substitute Wilfried Zaha created a tap-in for deserving Fraizer Campbell.

The eventful afternoon ended in traditional fashion, with the Palace manager, Neil Warnock, on the pitch, bawling at the referee and even his oen players.

The Palace fans had greeted their visitors with a cheery pre-match banner which read: ‘Roman’s dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game’. 

The tone having been set, Palace made a bright start, speedily deploying Campbell and Yannick Bolasie. 

But all the promise was deflated within six minutes when they conceded a free-kick 25 yards out. Oscar’s crashing strike reduced the chance to casual simplicity, the ball flying into the far top corner.

On 28 minutes, John Terry became the latest to be defeated by the pace of Campbell, as he lunged hopefully and chopped him down. Referee Craig Pawson surprisingly decided against even a booking. Moments later, Delaney was booked for a similar assault upon Loic Remy, and the intensity of the match boiled over.

The managers were inevitably involved; Mourinho playing to the crowd with his repertoire of expansive gestures, Warnock standing in his technical area, arms folded, white shirt clinging to paunch, bawling a stream of eye-bulging exhortations and looking like a noisy neighbour from a 1970s sit-com.

The whole affair erupted, five minutes from half-time. Mile Jedinak won a ball near halfway, and Azpilicueta came lunging in, out of control. The referee rightly produced the red card. Willian was swiftly taken off, Filipe Luis came on, and Palace were required simply to get through to the interval. It was beyond them.

Proving that the idiocy of footballers knows no bounds, Delaney needlessly grasped at Remy as the striker moved past. Having already been carded, he was off. Palace’s advantage had dissolved within two minutes, and Warnock’s rant as the referee left the pitch would have been better directed at his own absurd defender.

Chelsea assumed assured control with the second half, their midfield dictating terms with some ease. And their command was reflected within six minutes when the endlessly influential Fabregas ran purposefully at a shuddering defence. He swapped passes with Eden Hazard and Oscar before striking his scoring drive with authority.

A feeling of inevitability settled upon the stadium. There may be two or three teams in Europe who could hope to survive after donating Chelsea a two-goal lead. But Palace are not remotely among that number.

The only genuine surprise came with the Palace goal, which saw substitute Zaha stepping nimbly along the byline to spread a perfect cross for Campbell’s eager acceptance. It was far too little, and much too late. They may not prove invincible, but the team which can beat them has yet to state its case.
