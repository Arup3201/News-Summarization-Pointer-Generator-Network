A 43-year-old school counsellor in Texas is facing up to ten years in jail after allegedly ‘sexting’ a teenage boy.

Cynthia Stewart allegedly sent the 15-year-old up to 30 photographs posing nude and had numerous sexual phone conversations with him.

Stewart, who is married with an eight-year-old child, was arrested after the boy's parents caught him talking to her in the early hours of the morning.

Counsellor: Cynthia Stewart allegedly sent a 15-year-old boy up to 30 photographs posing nude and had numerous sexual phone conversations with him

They noticed from mobile phone records their son had been speaking with Stewart on a daily basis with many calls taking place in the early hours.

When police interviewed the teen he showed them his cell phone that contained the indecent images.

He told investigators Stewart had sent him 20 to 30 naked images of herself by text.

Police obtained a search warrant for Stewart's home, and seized a computer and Stewart's cell phone.

According to an arrest warrant Stewart admitted sending close-up images to the teen.

Police in San Antonio, Texas, said Stewart had first met the teen two years ago through Facebook.

Paid leave: Stewart, who is known to colleagues as Cindy, worked as a counsellor at Olympic Elementary School in San Antonio

Their Facebook messages and texts became sexual and investigators are still trying to determine if the relationship went beyond texting.

A profile on the school's website said
Stewart was in her 21st year in education - five as a teacher and the past 
15 as a school counsellor.

'All
 of my professional experience has been at the elementary level in the 
states of Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, and Georgia; this is my third year 
in Judson ISD,’ the website said.

Stewart, who is known to colleagues as Cindy, worked as a counsellor at Olympic Elementary School in San Antonio.

Stewart is on paid administrative leave as the district investigates.

She is being held in jail prior to a bond hearing on Friday after being charged with receipt of child pornography and solicitation of a minor to engage in sexual conduct.

The maximum sentence for the charges is 10 years.

Last week Texas Housewife Lori David, 38, was banned from using the internet after pleading guilty to sexting a 16-year-old boy.
