A teenager has received support from around the world after he revealed his father had called his coming out as gay 'worse than death'.

Vancouver-born Tyler, 15, posted the Facebook conversation he had had with his dad on his Tumblr account, in which he is told that news of his sexuality is an 'embarrassment'.

He reveals that he first told his news to his sisters, who were extremely supportive, and then came out to his mother, before telling his father.

Tyler, a 15-year-old from Vancouver, came out to his father and has posted his reaction on social media

In response to Tyler's news, his father wrote back: ‘We took care of you since you were a baby. We loved you, took care of you when you’re sick. Lost many days and nights in all your fifteen years.

'Now this is what we get in return, shame and embarrassment.'

He continued: 'If only you didn't reject God and His teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you. Stay away.'

In further messages, perhaps in response to Tyler's Tumblr post, his father went on: 'Take out your post from social media.

'You embarrass me from all the people I knew. 

'I'm going to puke. Whatever you do it reflects on me. People will ridicule me, insult me, and I might turn out to be a criminal. I have enough of all this bulls***.'

He concluded: 'You are trying to ruin me. This is worse than death.'

Discussing his father's messages in an interview with  Huffington Post B.C., Tyler, who lives with his aunts, said: 'I’m hoping there’s still the possibility that he could change, even if it takes a while.

‘Maybe he could accept me, because that’s all I want… I just want him to be there for me.’ 

On his Twitter account, Tyler has posted two pictures of himself and his boyfriend, one of which is 'mom tells me not to be so public with my bf. I say f*** it'.
