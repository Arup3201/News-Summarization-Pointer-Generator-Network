Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a current detainee at Guantanamo, who has claimed he was forced to have sex with guards, in a new book 

A detainee at Guantanamo Bay says he was tortured and forced to have sex with female interrogators in his new book.

The claims come in the memoir of current inmate Mohamedou Ould Slahi, which was published earlier this week following a six-year legal battle to declassify the handwritten manuscript.

The 44-year-old swore allegiance to al-Qaeda after travelling to Afghanistan in the 1990s and fought against the Soviet Union-backed regime, but claims he left the group in 1992.

He was detained following the 9/11 attacks on suspicion of involvement in an unsuccessful plot to bomb Los Angeles in 1999.

He was taken to Cuba in 2002 following interrogation in Mauritania, Jordan and Afghanistan.

In the new book he recalls in a partly redacted account of how he was told he was going to be taught about 'great American sex' and sexually abused by two female prison guards.

In an extract published on Speigel Online he wrote: 'I stood up in the same painful position as I had every day for about 70 days.

'I would rather follow the orders and reduce the pain that would be caused when the guards come to play; the guards used every contact opportunity to beat the hell out of the detainee.

'As soon as I stood up, the two _______ took off their blouses, and started to talk all kind of dirty stuff you can imagine, which I minded less.

'What hurt me most was them forcing me to take part in a sexual threesome in the most degrading manner. Both _______ stuck on me, literally one on the front and the other older _______ stuck on my back rubbing ____ whole body on mine.

'At the same time they were talking dirty to me, and playing with my sexual parts'  

He also recalled how he continued to pray during the abuse but was then berated.

He wrote how he was told to 'Stop the f*** praying' and told that he was a hypocrite.

He added: 'I refused to stop speaking my prayers, and after that, I was forbidden to perform my ritual prayers for about one year to come. 

'I also was forbidden to fast during the sacred month of Ramadan October 2003, and fed by force.'  

The brother of Slahi, Yahdih Ould Slahi shows some the redacted pages of his older siblings' Guantanamo Diary, which was launched at a press conference in London today 

In the book 'Guantanamo Diary' Slahi also claims he only confessed to various terror plots, including one to bomb the CN Tower in Toronto after being tortured and humiliated.

Describing the toll of life inside the jail at the US base in Cuba, Slahi added: 'I started to hallucinate and hear voices as clear as crystal. I heard my family in a casual familial conversation…. I heard Qur'an readings in a heavenly voice.

'I heard music from my country. Later on the guards used these hallucinations and started talking with funny voices through the plumbing, encouraging me to hurt the guard and plot an escape.

'I was on the edge of losing my mind.'

The detainee's lawyer, Nancy Hollander, explained that her client has never been charged with any crime and says he should be released.

She said: 'It's not that they haven't found the evidence against him -– there isn't evidence against him.

'He's in what I would consider a horrible legal limbo, and it's just tragic: he needs to go home.

Slahi's lawyer Nancy Hollander says that her client has never been charged with any crime and she says he should be released 

Meanwhile the American Civil Liberties Union has launched an online petition demanding his release.

Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's national security project said: 'Mohamedou Slahi is an innocent man whom the United States brutally tortured and has held unlawfully for over a decade.

'He doesn't present a threat to the US and has never taken part in any hostilities against it.'

Benedict Cumberbatch and Jude Law are among a host a celebrities who have recorded readings from the diary of the Guantanamo Bay detainee.

Narrations by the actors from Slahi's account are being released today to mark the publication of a book based on the journal, as well as a campaign for him to be freed after being held in the prison camp for more than a decade.

Readings by other high profile figures including the author Philip Pullman, actor Dominic West and musician Brian Eno are set to follow in the coming days, while recordings featuring Stephen Fry and Colin Firth have already been released.

At a press conference in London today to launch the book and a campaign for the detainee's release, his younger brother Yahdih Ould Slahi said: 'If you read the book you can see every line, every word is written with the blood and tears.'  

Slahi was taken to the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, pictured, in 2002 on suspicion of being involved in a plot to bomb Los Angeles in 1999 

He described his family's pride in the publication of the book. 'He gave a voice to all the people that are suffering in similar situations,' he said.

Larry Siems, the editor of the book, described Slahi as 'one of the most abused prisoners in Guantanamo' and said his writings detail 'harrowing' treatment. 

He said: 'The torture squad were so well trained that they were performing almost perfect crimes, avoiding leaving any obvious evidence.

'Nothing was left to chance. They hit in pre-defined places. They practised horrible methods, the aftermath of which would only manifest later.'
