At least 17 children and a female teacher have been burned to death after a faulty gas cylinder exploded on a bus taking them to school in eastern Pakistan.

Seven other youngsters were also injured in the blast on the outskirts of the city of Gujrat. Five of them were in serious condition in hospital.

Twenty-fourÂ  children, aged between five and 15, were being taken to a private school when the vehicle caught fire, local police chief Dar Ali Khattak told AFP.

Wounded: One of the officers hurt in a suspected militant attack on a police convoy 12 miles from the city of Peshawar

Victim: The body of a police officer killed in the clash with suspected militants lies on a hospital trolly as his colleagues attend to him

He added: 'The fire erupted in the vehicle when the children were only a few kilometres from their school.

The blaze was apparently caused by a spark when the driver of the dual-fuel van switched from gas to petrol, he added.

The driver survived the explosion 120 miles southeast of the capital Islamabad, by fleeing the fire.

Many vehicles in Pakistan are powered by relatively cheap compressed natural gas and cylinder blasts are common.

The accident comes after two suspected
 militant attacks left nine people dead in two different areas of 
northwest Pakistan on Friday.

Suspected
 militants armed with heavy weapons attacked a police convoy in Mattani,
 12 miles south of the main northwest city of Peshawar, killing six 
officers and wounding seven others.

In the second attack, a suicide bomber walked up to a vehicle owned by an Afghan religious leader in Peshawar and set off his explosives, killing three people, said police officer Riaz Ali Shah.

The leader, Haji Hayatullah, was not harmed in the attack because he was in a nearby mosque attending prayers. Hayatullah's driver and guard were killed, said Shah.

A passerby was also killed and two others were wounded,

There are more than one million refugees in Pakistan from neighboring Afghanistan. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
