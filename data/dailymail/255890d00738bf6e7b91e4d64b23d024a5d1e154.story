An evil care worker was caught on CCTV stealing cash from a housebound pensioner, who died from the stress of watching the footage months later.

Jennifer Marley, 53, was paid to visit and look after Mavis Pately, 79, but began helping herself to cash that was left lying around her home.

The elderly woman's family became suspicious and installed security cameras in the property, which captured Marley rummaging through drawers, looking for money.

Cruel: Jennifer Marley, 53, who was paid to look after housebound Mavis Pately, 79, helped herself to cash

Footage: The security cameras captured her rummaging through the pensioners drawers

She stole more than £1,000 from the frail pensioner and has now been convicted of two counts of theft at Plymouth Crown Court.

Former nurse Mavis has since died and her family say the shock of watching the CCTV footage upset her so much it 'put her in the ground'.

Mrs Pately's children believe their 
mother’s shock in finding that her trusted carer was a thief contributed
 to her death months later.

Guilty: Marley was convicted of two counts of theft at Plymouth Crown Court

Speaking after the case Mrs Pately's son Gary McKinnon branded Marley the 'scum of the Earth'.

He said: 'She was in shock when she saw the CCTV.

'She was never the same again. It helped put my mother in the ground.

'At least now she can rest in peace.

'My mother trusted her and liked her. She did not want it to be her. It knocked her for six.'

Marley was arrested after the CCTV captured her stealing an envelope containing £1,000 in cash and taking another containing fake notes - set up by Mrs Pately's children.

The carer was seen rummaging through a drawer on two occasions on successive days and taking something from the unit a few days later.

Marley, who had helped Mrs Patey for six months, was so trusted by the pensioner that she asked her to become her preferred carer and take over visits from others.

Marley denied one charge of stealing an envelope containing £1,000 between September and November 2012.

She pleaded not guilty to attempted theft of more cash - which turned out to be the envelope containing plain paper.

But a jury found her guilty of both counts and she will be sentenced at a later date.

She was acquitted of the theft of two further envelopes containing £1,000, which the family say disappeared earlier from the same drawer.

Concerned: Mrs Pately's family had installed the video devices after becoming suspicious off Marley's behaviour

Judge Paul Darlow released Marley on bail last Friday pending a probation report, but warned that she could be sent to jail.

Marley has resigned from the agency First Call where she had worked since 2003. She returned the £1,000 but the family believe £2,000 is still missing.

DC Ben Larcombe of Devon and Cornwall Police, said after the verdicts: 'Unfortunately Mavis’s decline in health and death prevented her from seeing justice done.'
