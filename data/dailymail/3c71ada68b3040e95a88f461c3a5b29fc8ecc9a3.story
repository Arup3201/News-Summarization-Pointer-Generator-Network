Backing down from a dare in front of your friends is one thing but one baseball fan decided he would rather risk arrest than lose face in front of thousands of Twitter users.

Dylan McCue-Masone set himself a challenge on the social networking site that if his post was retweeted 1,000 times he would run on to the field during the All-Star Game at Citi Field, in New York, last night.

But his dare led to an arrest and a heavy tackle by security guards, who did not see the funny side.

The entire challenge was played out on Twitter and McCue-Masone even posted texts from his mother begging him not to be so stupid.

Shortly after 7pm, the teenager wrote '1000 RT's and ill run across the field...'

When the figure reached 300 within an hour, he clearly began to get nervous.

As the number of retweets continued to rise McCue-Masone wrote: 'This is gonna be terrible' before posting 'I hate all of you'.

Once the target was reached, the full scale of his dare dawned on the teenager but he refused to back down.

The teenager's original message was retweeted more than 1,000 times

He posted to his followers, which is 
now more than 5,000: 'alright... i guess have no choice... gonna try to 
get out by left field.'

As Twitter encouraged him to go through with his dare, his mother tried to make him change his mind.

In a message the teenager posted online, she wrote: 'Dylan it's not funny that a serious thing and u could get arrested if not worse please don't b ridiculous'.

In his final tweets before running onto the field, McCue-Masone wrote: 'blame it on social media, love you all' and then 'if i actually get on the field pray for me cause my moms gonna kill me.'

His last tweet was a picture from the side of the field and the simple caption 'AHHH'.

After encouragement on Twitter, he decides to go ahead with the dare

In videos of the incident, the teenager 
can be seen running on the field in front of the tens of thousands of 
fans waving his hands in the air.

But security quickly caught up with him and tackled him to the ground before escorting him off the pitch.

McCue-Masone was charged with interfering with a professional sporting event.

The teenager could now face fines worth thousands of dollars and hours of community service.

The fan may also be banned from the ground.

Mets fan Brendan Lane, who was at the game, told NY Daily News: 'People were laughing (when he was on the field) and the climax was when the guy tackles him, aggressively. He tackled him like he had been waiting a long time to tackle someone.'
