Have you ever tried camping over a ravine with nothing but a few ropes and wires between you a 420-foot drop?

Well, as these fearless friends will tell you... the experience is highly in-tents.

Slackliner Andy Lewis and 11 of his friends swapped picnics for parachutes on a daredevil adventure aboard a 'midair campsite' in Moab, Utah.

Complex job: The majority of the system was connected on the ground and needed 12 people rigging at the same time to pull it into the air

He said: 'The best thing is that you are high enough to parachute off the net. You can literally step out of your tent, fall off the net, and fly away.

'I am totally intrigued by the height. It is frustratingly scary and quite distracting.

'It causes a unique and challenging focus that becomes addicting.'

Lewis, who goes by the nickname Sketchy Andy, even slept in the tent overnight with his fiancee Hayley Ashburn.

'I brought out dinner, pillows, beer, smokes, and movies,' said the 26-year-old from San Francisco, USA.

'We had a wonderfully romantic and incredibly memorable and beautiful night.'

Monkey madness: Lewis came up with the 'net' plan four years ago but it was only this year that he managed to finally build it - with the help of fellow adventurers the Moab Monkeys

Fun in the air: The crew took turns highlining, base-jumping and falling 350ft on a rope swing

Lewis, who hit headlines when he performed alongside Madonna at the 2012 NFL Super Bowl, came up with the 'net' plan four years ago.

But it was only this year that he managed to finally build it - with the help of fellow adventurers the Moab Monkeys.

The majority of the system was connected on the ground and needed 12 people rigging at the same time to pull it into the air.

The slacklines were 55m, 60m and 70m long and the entire network - weighing 300lbs - took 24 hours to secure.

They named it the 'Space Thong' - because of its resemblance to a giant G-string.

The crew then took turns highlining, base-jumping and falling 350ft on a rope swing.

Lewis, who owns climbing equipment firm Slackline Brothers, described the experience as 'unbelievable'.

'It is a fabricated emotion of a near-death experience. It lets you know what is important in your life.

'Mostly I think about my life and the lives of my friends. I think about keeping everyone safe mostly, then combining that with the most dangerous activities.

'It's a wonderful paradox indeed. Falling down 350ft on a couple of ropes can be deadly. But when done right, it can be amazingly fun, and a reliable way to stay safe while being able to feel the fear of falling.'
