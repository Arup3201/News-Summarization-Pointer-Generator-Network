Prince Charles has been praised by Nick Clegg for deploying his ‘powers of persuasion’ to bring the three party leaders together to launch his new volunteering drive.

The Lib Dem leader,  who shared a platform with David Cameron and Ed Miliband at the Step Up 2 Serve launch last week, told Charles: ‘I suspect the next time David, Ed and I are on a platform together we’ll be tearing strips off each other.

'Your powers of persuasion have encouraged us to set aside those differences.’     

In last week’s Mail on Sunday, the Prince explained how his campaign to get more youngsters interested in volunteering was designed to tackle unemployment and gang violence. He said he was moved to act after the 2008 killing of Jimmy Mizen, 16, who bled to death in his brother’s arms.

Charles said listening to families who had lost children to street murders had inspired him to find ‘solutions to a problem which has blighted too many lives’.

The project aims to increase the numbers of those aged ten to 20 involved in social projects from under a third to half by 2020.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Cameron described Charles as ‘absolutely visionary’, adding: ‘This goes way above and beyond politics, and you can see that from the evidence that the leaders of Britain’s three biggest political parties are here today.’
