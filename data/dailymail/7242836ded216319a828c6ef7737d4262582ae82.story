Craig Warren was speared in the head with a wooden 1960’s-style Malibu surfboard when a ‘hipster’ refused to wear a leg rope while he was surfing.

The 40-year-old was swimming with his children and some friends at Snappers Rocks on the Gold Coast about two weeks ago when he noticed a long board flying at him ‘like a missile’.

The Currumbin resident told Daily Mail Australia that it was only a matter of time before being cool meant killing someone.

‘I noticed the board coming at me like a missile when the guy fell off with no leg rope,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I tried to dodge it and I could have potentially got out of the way if I dived down but the water was too shallow.

‘Those old school boards are very heavy and big and they could seriously cause death. 

‘I’m not being a grumpy old man but a classic example is – if my head was one of my kids or someone else’s son or daughter, the outcome would be a lot different. 

'The one that hit me had a reasonable size fin on it and it took a chunk out of my head.'

The father of two was dragged back to shore by his nine-year-old son Taj and was bandaged on the spot by his friend, who was an off-duty paramedic at the time and a lifesaver.

‘I was rushed to hospital after and had 23 stitches all up,’ he said.

Mr Warren, who works in sales for surf brand Globe Industries, said even the most experienced surfers wear leg ropes.

‘I have been surfing for many years and I couldn’t go without a leg rope,’ he said.

'But these hipsters think they're too cool for leg ropes and want to live the lifestyle.'

Mr Warren said their actions are putting lives at risk and similar incidents like this could be avoided if the surfers wear a leg rope.

‘If you get up on a wave and fall off – you fall two to three metres but your board will travel 200 to 300 metres like a missile. 

‘It doesn’t need to be a law but these guys need to be more responsible and take it into consideration when they’re surfing.

‘Throw a leg rope on – it gets really crowded at Snappers Rocks, Byron Bay and Noosa and you can avoid causing danger or putting someone’s life at risk.

A Gold Coast City Council spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the City could not comment on the matter.

But Snapper Rocks Surfriders Club president Jay Philips told Daily Mail Australia that the 'hipsters'  have become a problem  at Snappers Rocks.

'There are 200 to 300 people surfing at the same time and they're gonna have a board coming at them without doubt and endangering people's lives.

'Their boards go flying when they fall off and when it's coming at you, there's no way getting out of it.

'On Tuesday, we had 30-40 kids swimming in our program and around 10 guys were surfing with no leg ropes and one of our locals pointed it out and said "where's your leg rope?" and they just turned around and said "we don't need it".'

'If that board hits one of my kids - they're gonna hear about it.'

When asked how the label 'hipsters' had come about, Mr Philips said the 'hipsters' have been a 'craze' in the area for a while.

'Just an image they have with their long hair and beards - It's an era that a lot of them like to live still and they're trying to live like the 60s.

'But as I'd like to say is - the 60s are done so just wear a leg rope.'
