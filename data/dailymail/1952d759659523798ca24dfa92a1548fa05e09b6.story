In the words of her husband, it could have been a ‘career- ending fashion disaster’.

But Samantha Cameron pulled off a bright-red onesie with aplomb yesterday as she took part in a charity run for Sport Relief. 

Fashion consultant Mrs Cameron got well and truly into the spirit of the Sport Relief Mile in Cutteslowe Park, Oxford, completing the outfit with a pair of matching Sport Relief deely-boppers.

David Cameron on the other hand stuck out like a sore thumb in a conservative navy tracksuit top and running shorts.

The
 Prime Minister claimed he had been ‘prevented’ from wearing a onesie 
because he couldn’t get hold of one in the correct size.

But he perhaps hit on the real reason when he joked it meant he had managed to swerve a ‘career-ending fashion disaster’.

Mr Cameron’s potential leadership 
rival, London Mayor Boris Johnson, has boasted of owning of a Union Jack
 onesie, but he has never worn it in public.

After the one-mile charity run, Mr Cameron said: 'Sport Relief brings together some of 
  the best things about Britain - we are a great sporting nation, but also one 
  of the most generous countries when it comes to contributing to good causes.

'This is the third time I have run the Sport Relief mile and I am 
  delighted to have taken part in such a fantastic event that is bringing 
  people across the UK together to get active, raise money and change lives.'

Other celebrities 
taking part in Sports Relief events across the country included former 
glamour model Katie Price, Hollyoaks actress Jorgie Porter and 
Coronation Street star Catherine Tyldesley.

A record-breaking £51m was raised by Sport Relief during Friday's live show on BBC1.
