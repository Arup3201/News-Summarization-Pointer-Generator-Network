Revelations: Details of an affair between Alison Levitt, QC, pictured, and a Lib Dem peer were covered in the press

Any claims charges against Rebekah Brooks over the phone hacking scandal may have been motivated by a tabloid expose of a key prosecuting lawyer’s affair with a peer have been rubbished as ‘preposterous’.

Director of Prosecutions Keir Starmer, QC, mounted a fierce defence of his principal advisor Alison Levitt, QC, amid suggestion she is not impartial because of her experiences at the hands of the press.

In 2007, married Ms Levitt - now in charge of overseeing CPS decision making and all potential prosecutions - embarked on a five-month affair with the then Government’s anti-terror adviser Lord Carlile of Berriew.

The barrister’s relationship with the peer 15 years her senior made national headlines after it was revealed by the Mail on Sunday.

According to the Telegraph it is understood lawyers for the former News of the World and Sun editor are weighing up whether to use the revelations to seek a judicial review, claiming Ms Levitt has a ‘jaundiced view of the tabloid press’.

But the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, slammed any suggestions of a conflict of interest over the decision to bring charges of perverting justice.

He said: ‘It is preposterous to question the judgement of my Principal Legal Advisor, Alison Levitt QC, on the basis that five years ago the News of the World wrote three sentences about her private life, repeating what had been reported elsewhere and which had been, in any event, common knowledge for a year.

‘Alison Levitt QC was not even aware that the News of the World had written anything about her until it was drawn to her attention yesterday. She is a distinguished and highly respected QC.’

Her legal team is said to be looking into whether Ms Levitt alone took the decision to bring charges – in which case a challenge may be more likely – or sought external legal advice. 

Mrs Brooks reacted with fury to the announcement, on Tuesday, she - along with five others including her husband Charlie Brooks - would be charged with perverting justice, branding it a ‘witch-hunt’.

In an extraordinary outburst, former News International chief executive, said it was an ‘expensive sideshow and a waste of public money’.

Standing by her side, Mr Brooks – an Old Etonian friend of David Cameron – said that he and four other suspects also charged with attempting to hide evidence from police had been made ‘scapegoats’.

Earlier in the day the Crown Prosecution Service had taken the unusual step of summoning the cameras to announce the charges live on television.

Miss Levitt, who became a barrister at the age of 23, told assembled journalists: ‘This statement is made in the interests of transparency and accountability to explain the decisions reached in respect of allegations that Rebekah Brooks conspired with her husband, Charles Brooks, and others to pervert the course of justice.

‘The Crown Prosecution Service received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police Service on 27th March 2012 in relation to seven suspects:

‘All the evidence has now carefully been considered.

‘Applying the two-stage test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors I have concluded that in relation to all suspects except the seventh, there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction.

‘I then considered the second stage of the test, and I have concluded that a prosecution is required in the public interest in relation to each of the other six.

She added: ‘All these matters relate to the ongoing police investigation into allegations of phone hacking and corruption of public officials in relation to the News of the World and The Sun newspapers.

But the QC also stressed: ‘May I remind all concerned that these six individuals now will be charged with criminal offences and that each has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.’
