An eight-year-old boy could have survived his fatal asthma attack if an ambulance call-handler hadn't marked the case as 'less serious', a coroner has ruled.  

Clayton Barker died after paramedics were delayed because his grandmother's 999 call was put in a low-priority category.

If the 'correct response' had been taken, the ambulance would have arrived before Clayton collapsed and his chances of survival would probably have been 'enhanced', an inquest heard.

Tragic: The ambulance did not arrive for 23 minutes when Clayton Barker, eight, fell into a fatal asthma attack

Devastated: His mother Gemma Barker (pictured) heard he could have had a chance of survival if the 999 operator had correctly noted down the call. The call-handler marked the case as 'less serious'

Clayton had been staying at his grandmother's house when he collapsed, unable to breathe.

But when his grandmother Elaine Barker phoned 999, the operator thought the emergency was less serious than it was.

It meant the next waiting ambulance was sent to another emergency instead - and Clayton was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the call.

The young boy was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance staff, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Tests showed he died of an acute asthmatic attack.

The tragedy - described as a 'subconscious and isolated mistake' - unfolded when the call handler asked a scripted question, but took the wrong answer, the inquest at Heywood Coroner's Court was told.

The call operator - who had taken nearly 80 calls during the 12-hour shift - asked Clayton's grandmother: 'Is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths?'.

But when the operator heard Clayton mutter something in the background, she wrongly registered the answer as 'no' instead of 'yes'.

It meant Clayton's situation was thought to be less urgent than it was - leading to a 13-minute delay in the ambulance arriving. 

Simon Nelson, senior coroner for Manchester North, said: 'Clayton Barker died following an acute asthmatic attack.

'The evidence at the inquest confirmed that the first of two emergency 999 calls was not processed in line with best practise.

'Full of energy': Clayton was diagnosed with asthma at the age of five, he was described him as 'mischievous'

Apology: The Trust apologised to Clayton's mother, grandmother and two brothers for the delay

'Had the correct response been generated, then the ambulance would have arrived before rather than after Clayton collapsed, in which case, on the balance of probabilities, his chances of survival would have been enhanced.'

Gemma Barker described her son, one of three brothers, as 'mischievous' and 'full of energy', despite being diagnosed with asthma from the age of five. 

Angela Lee, assistant service manager at the emergency centre of North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) told the inquest the call handler had been using a series of scripted questions as part of a 'medical priority dispatch system' that was used nationally and internationally.

Mrs Lee said all staff had been reminded of the importance of recording information accurately.

She added: 'It was an individual error, I don't believe there needs to be a change in procedure.'

Gemma Barker is understood to be taking legal action against NWAS through criminal negligence lawyers at Slater & Gordon.

Solicitor Zak Golombeck said: 'Gemma and her family would like to thank the coroner for his full and thorough investigation.

'The evidence was unambiguous that had the initial 999 call been categorised correctly and attended Clayton in a timely manner, Clayton's chance of survival would have been enhanced.

'Gemma's loss is not something words can describe.

'Clayton was a happy and lively young boy who will be deeply missed by his family, especially his two brothers.

'Unambiguous': The coroner ruled Clayton's chance of survival would certainly have been enhanced had he been reached sooner

'I will now be advising Gemma in relation to pursuing legal action against the ambulance service.'

Derek Cartwright, director of operations for NWAS, said: 'The Trust would like to offer our apologies and express our sincere condolences to Clayton's family. We fully appreciate that this must be a very difficult time for them.

'The control manager informed the court that an error had been made in the control room at the time of the incident, which unfortunately resulted in a delay in despatching an ambulance to the address.

'We therefore accept the coroner's comments and since this tragic incident, have reviewed our processes within our control rooms.

'The trust is committed to learning from all incidents in order to avoid any similar occurrences and to improve patient care and safety.

'We would also like to thank the coroner for his handling of this sensitive case.'
