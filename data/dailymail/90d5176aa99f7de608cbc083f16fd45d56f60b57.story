Victim: Cold Spring police officer Tom Decker, pictured, was shot twice and killed on Thursday in what authorities are calling an ambush killing

A Minnesota police officer and father-of-four has been shot dead, allegedly by the suicidal man he'd been called out to assist.

Tom Decker, 31, of Cold Spring Police, arrived at the home of Ryan Larson, 34, around 11pm on Thursday to check on his welfare after receiving a call from his concerned family.

But while he was getting out of his squad car, the officer was ambushed and, despite wearing a bulletproof vest, died at the scene.

Police said several guns were found at the scene and Mr Larson had been taken into custody on suspicion of second degree murder.

The county attorney's office was considering criminal charges.

'It's apparent to us the officer was ambushed at the scene,' said Drew Evans, assistant superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

Investigators wouldn't elaborate on why they believe the shooting was an ambush, saying only that the shooting was still being investigated.

Stearns County Sheriff John Sanner 
said his department got a call around 9pm reportedly from Mr Larson's 
family, saying he might be suicidal.

Cold Spring police went to his home once and couldn't raise anyone, then returned almost two hours later. It was during the second trip that Mr Decker was shot.

On Friday, residents of Cold Spring, a city with a population of about 4,000 located 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis, were mourning the loss of the brave six-year veteran officer.

'He was a policeman trying to help 
someone. He was called there to help and he went there and was shot 
doing his job,' said Donna Knaus, a manager at Cold Spring Bakery not 
far from the crime scene. 'It's horrible.'

Florence Benson, 72, of Rockville, just a few miles down the road, added: 'It's a terrible, terrible thing in a community this size. Just about everybody knows everybody - especially police officers.'

The officer grew up on a farm south of town, and after graduating from college, worked at several small Minnesota police departments before coming home for what he called his dream job.

Mr Decker leaves behind a wife and four children from a previous marriage - two daughters ages 8 and 7, and two sons ages 6 and 5.

One woman who said she didn't know the officer left a flower bouquet for his family at City Hall, where a heart-shaped balloon and candle were also left.

A banner made at a local school was filled with dozens of colorful handprints cut out of construction paper and read: 'We thank all of you for your service to our community.'

When asked about the banner, Cold Spring Mayor Doug Schmitz was moved to tears. 'It's tough,' he whispered.

'A lot of people woke up this morning in shock, and we're still in shock,' he said later. 'We're a strong community. We just bind together here. It's going to be a tough few days and weeks to come, but we'll make it.'

Blocks surrounding the crime scene were cordoned off with police tape on Friday, and officers - some using dogs, others searching rooftops - canvassed the area.

Several guns were found, according to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, but the agency was searching for additional weapons that may be related to Mr Decker's death.

Brian Moen, who lives about a block from the bar, said officers who came to his door told him they were looking for a sawed-off shotgun.

Cold Spring Police Chief Phil Jones said Mr Decker was the 'department jokester' on a force with only eight full-time officers. Mr Decker served as the department's instructor on firearms and use of force.

Mr Jones said he never had problems with Mr Decker, noting he'd received repeated letters of commendation and appreciation.

His younger brother, Joe Decker, said his sibling loved to travel and be outdoors. He said Tom Decker was shy and reserved as a youngster but became outgoing and gregarious as an adult.

'He was one of those people who'd be the life of the party,' Joe Decker said.

Police attention had been drawn before to Mr Larson, a machine tool student at St. Cloud Technical and Community College, though mostly for traffic-related offenses but once in an abuse case.

In 2009, he reached a plea agreement to settle a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge for engaging in behavior that could 'arouse alarm, anger, or resentment in others.'

As part of the plea deal, he served a day in jail and agreed to undergo domestic abuse counseling. A no-contact order was issued. Court files indicated he violated his probation in 2010.

'He's a normal person,' Jeff Scoles Jr., a friend of Mr Larson's, told the AP late on Friday. 'He's not a monster.'

Mr Scoles said his friend lived in an apartment above his bar and has filled in as a bartender at another bar he owns. Mr Scoles added that Mr Larson was doing his homework at one of the bars on Thursday and was in a 'good mood' when he left that afternoon.

He added that Mr Larson took a concealed-carry class in January and that Mr Larson owned guns, but 'was cautious with them.'

Condolences for Decker came from fellow police officers in other Minnesota departments and from elected officials, including Gov. Mark Dayton.

'On behalf of the people of Minnesota, I extend my deepest sympathies to his family and to the Cold Springs Police Department for their tragic loss of an outstanding officer, father and friend,' the governor said.
