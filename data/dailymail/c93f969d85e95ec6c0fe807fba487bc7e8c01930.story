For all Manchester City’s attacking flair last season, there were times when the cavalier approach bordered on the naive and a certain fragility was apparent.

We need only think back to the last time Manuel Pellegrini side’s faced Monday night's opponents on that emotional afternoon in April. Liverpool won 3-2 because City were too open and were torn to pieces in a scorching first half.

Ultimately, it did not matter. As Liverpool stumbled in the title race, City pulled away. It was, however, an instructive afternoon for Pellegrini, who will also be concerned that City last season lost home and away to Chelsea and failed to win at Arsenal.

Strength in depth: Fernando will add assuredness to Manchester City's midfield this season

Hard tackler: The former Porto man impressed on his debut against Newcastle last Sunday

They also lost 3-1 at home by Bayern Munich. It is those results that perhaps persuaded City to push through a £12million deal for Porto’s Fernando, after almost sealing a move in January.

Pellegrini favours adventurous football but the acquisition of Fernando  suggests we may see a cuter City this season. City will now have muscularity to complement the elegance.

City already boast Fernandinho and Yaya Toure in central positions but there was a suspicion that at times they neglected their defensive duties. Now, City could field a three-man midfield with Fernando, providing greater protection in front of the defence.

Fernandinho sees his new team-mate as a positive addition. ‘Fernando is a big signing for us,’ he said. ‘The club is not just thinking about defending the title but also the Champions League.

‘Our target is to reach the Champions League final and I’m sure he can help us do it. Whether it is me, Yaya or Fernando who plays, we have the quality to win the Champions League.’

Attacking force: He will be hoping to complement the creative talents of Yaya Toure in City's midfield

Competition: And he will likely be challenging fellow Brazilian Fernandinho for the second central rol

Pellegrini may opt to experiment for the first time with all three in the same midfield tonight.

Fernandinho, though available, is also still working towards full fitness after returning late from the World Cup, so if Pellegrini plays with only two in there, he may a face a battle with compatriot Fernando for a starting place.

‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Fernandinho. ‘If he plays one game, I can play another, and sometimes we can play together.’

The Brazilians did not know each other before Fernando’s arrival but have hit it off. Fernandinho added: ‘We have worked and lived together and done things socially. I told him to find a house near me. He is like me, calm and quiet.’
