Argentina are getting ready for their World Cup quarter-final showdown with Belgium where Lionel Messi can win his fifth man-of-the-match award in as many games.

Coach Alejandro Sabella will hope the Barcelona maestro produces another pivotal performance when they take to the Estadio Nacional pitch in Brasilia in a bid to reach the final four.

Sabella, though, has been on the defensive for his other forwards, insisting striker Gonzalo Higuain is pulling his weight despite not scoring yet.

3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Robin van Persie (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)

Those in italic are out of the World Cup.

Napoli player Higuain has been struggling for fitness after an ankle injury in May, and Messi has been heavily relied on for goals so far.

The 26-year-old, playing at the centre of a three-man attack, has had little joy against defenders, but Sabella thinks his form is improving as the tournament goes on.

The Argentina boss said: 'We all have a lot of confidence in him because he is a great player who is doing a great job for the team. What's missing is the goalscoring.

'He is improving every day. In the last match he ran more than any other player. He sacrifices himself for the team.

'All strikers need to score goals, but also help the team. 'I'm staying calm. Hopefully the goal will arrive soon.'

But with Sergio Aguero's injury, Carlos Tevez being excluded and Higuain yet to find his feet in Brazil, Sabella may lean on Messi once more.
