A popular Orange County bakery sickened at least 40 of its customers after serving them Three Kings cake laced with synthetic drugs

The bread was sold by ten of the bakery's outlets

'The only common denominator with all these patients is they ate this Three Kings bread in celebration of the holiday,' Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told NBC Los Angeles.

The bread was sold by ten of the bakery's outlets. 

He says the exact drug has yet to be identified but lab specialists are now investigating.

'There are hundreds of types of synthetic drugs,' he said. 'Hopefully they can isolate what exactly we're talking about.'

The dessert is eaten to mark Three Kings Day on Jan. 6 

Anyone who may have come into contact with the bread is urged to call the Santa Ana Police Crimes Against Persons Unit at 714-245-8390

One woman said she fainted after eating her cake, while another victim said his entire family because nauseated and anxious - including his 4-year-old son. 

Anyone who may have come into contact with the bread is urged to call the Santa Ana Police Crimes Against Persons Unit at 714-245-8390.

The bakery has been closed to undergo a professional cleaning and the staff is given mandatory food safety training.
