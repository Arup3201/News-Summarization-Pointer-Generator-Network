A new Aussie invention could just be the coolest thing around, literally!

Take one of the nation's most beloved summer pastimes - backyard cricket and if you mix it with one of the countries most used outdoor items, an esky and ta da... it's the Cricket Cooler.

And it's not just ANY cooler and stump set, it's equip with cup holders for the batsman and wicket keeper, stumps which double as a handle and rotate 270 degrees for storage and convenience during play(now that handly!), wheels for easy transportation, a 33 litre compartment capacity and it also comes with the green and gold classic Aussie colours.

Take one of the nation's most beloved summer pastimes - backyard cricket and if you mix it with one of the countries most used outdoor items, an esky and it's the Cricket Cooler (pictured x3)

Cool or what! The new Cricket Cooler (pictured) is equip with stumps (also used as a handle and rotate) cup holders, wheels and is 33 litre capacity

A prototype was put onto Kickstarter by two Adelaide lads which had pledges of more than $40,000

Combine an Aussie tradition with an well used Aussie item and you get the Cricket Cooler

Adelaide lads Adam Dubrich and Leigh Warren came up with the idea when they struggled to drag all of their stuff from the car to the park one day with family and friends.

They had an abundance of gear from coolers, picnic rugs, hampers, bats, balls and the rest.

'We knew we could help solve this and in the process make something really cool and useful at the same time,' they said.

'You only need to take a look at any beach in Australia or drive past the local park and you will see children, teenagers and adults playing our beloved sport, Cricket.'

'Instead of stumps (wicket) they will use a bin, a body board, a chair or any other item that can double as a wicket.'

It's so handy the stumps double as a handle and rotate 270 degrees

You can also opt to put the stumps down on the Cricket Cooler (pictured)

WOW! cup holders too. The Cricket Cooler is an essential for every Aussie

So to kill two birds with one stone, the boys imagined and designed what is now the Cricket Cooler which they say perfectly reflects the Australian culture.

'Good times with friends and family, sport, recreation and the outdoors lifestyle.' 

With the 2015 cricket season approaching, which includes the Cricket World cup, they pledged their idea to Kickstarter to go towards the production of the unique product. 

And the invention turned out to be a hit and one of Kickstarter's most funded projects.

125 backers put their money up to raise over $40,000 which was successfully funded by last month.

Now this summer be prepared..... because the Cricket Cooler is on the market, perfect for the beach, backyard or the oval, or hey.... anywhere really. 

And it's yours for just $89.95, pretty much a bargain for the coolest, cooler around. 

But one thing is you might need to try to refrain from using a real cricket ball when bowling towards the Cricket Cooler, advised to only use a tennis ball.

Great to share a beer with friends whilst playing cricket

The Cricket Cooler was started from Kickstarter by two Adelaide lads who had trouble always carting their gear around

What an invention, just in time for the cricket season in 2015 and the Cricket World Cup

The best thing is that the Cricket Cooler (pictured) comes in the good old Aussie green and gold colours

It's good for any time - the beach, backyard and on an oval

Share the joy of the Cricket Cooler with friends and wheel it around wherever you need it
