Colombian football's past and present met in Spain this week, as Real Madrid superstar James Rodriguez posted a picture of himself with fellow countryman Carlos Valderrama. 

The pair were pictured laughing together at Madrid's training ground, and Rodriguez later uploaded the snap to Instagram, alongside a message translated as: 'Visit from the Great 10. My idol, my admiration.'

They seemed to share a joke as Rodriguez, pictured in his pink training kit, met the Colombian legend, who has made over 100 appearances for the national team.

Rodriguez recently won the coveted Puskas award at the Ballon d'Or Gala, for his stunning strike against Uruguay at the World Cup.

Madrid's signing of Rodriguez has proved a popular one at the Bernabeu, with Madrid reportedly recouping £20million of his £71m transfer fee on replica shirts within 48 hours of his signing.

The forward has received plenty of attention for his technique and play-making skills, with many Colombians seeing him as Valderrama's successor as national footballing hero.

Valderrama himself is an open admirer of the 23-year-old, publicly praising Rodriguez after his impressive World Cup performances in an interview with El Enganche:

'James Rodriguez already showed how good he is during the past FIFA World Cup,' he said.

'The single fact that he managed to adapt so well to a group which already had several veteran and established players, simply speaks for itself.'
