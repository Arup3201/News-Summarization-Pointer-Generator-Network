West Indian cricket, once the envy of the world game, is facing oblivion after the Board of Control for Cricket in India responded with fury to the cancelled tour that has again exposed the fragile nature of the sport’s finances.

The cricketing community was already reeling following last week’s decision by the West Indian players to call off their tour of India with a three-Test series left unplayed because of a pay dispute with their own board.

But on Tuesday the BCCI escalated the crisis, saying they would start legal proceedings against the West Indies Cricket Board for a loss of income they claim to be as high as £40million, and suspending all series between the two countries. Sri Lanka stepped in at a moment’s notice for a five-match one-day series, starting on November 2.

It is the fate of West Indies, however, that concerns most cricket-lovers. A successful claim by India would cripple West Indian cricket for good.

A year ago, their board was £3.5m in debt. This year’s financial report by KPMG suggests ‘there is substantial doubt the company will be able to continue as a going concern’.

India’s suspension of bilateral ties will cost the West Indian game more than it can afford. India’s previous full tour of the Caribbean, in 2011, netted the hosts an estimated £14m in TV rights.

But that money has gone and the potential loss of India’s proposed visit in 2016 could bring West Indies to their knees.

As Tony Cozier, the respected Caribbean broadcaster, wrote: ‘It should not have come to this.’

In truth, the writing has been on the wall for some time.

West Indies’ recent history is bedevilled by squabbles over pay, and the only surprise is that such drastic action, which has produced a sympathetic response from Jamaican legend Michael Holding but opprobrium in other quarters, was not taken earlier.

For those who recall West Indies’ 15-year reign of terror, the latest development will bring only sadness. Between 1979-80, when they lost in New Zealand, and 1994-95, when Australia became the first visiting side to win in the Caribbean for 22 years, West Indies won 21 of their 29 Test series and drew eight.

No one could touch them; everyone feared them.

Now, only Zimbabwe and Bangladesh rank below West Indies in both Tests and one-day internationals.

They haven’t won a single Test against a major nation outside the Caribbean for almost seven years.

It seems their administrators have mislaid their political nous, too. To fall out with India, whose finances effectively bankroll the smaller Test nations, is tantamount to suicide.

Tellingly, the Indians are pointing the finger at the West Indies board rather than the players, many of whom are important members of the various IPL franchises. IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal has blamed ‘the arrogance of the WICB’, adding: ‘The players can’t be blamed.’

What happens next is anyone’s guess. It is inconceivable that West Indies will be allowed to send a second-string team to tour South Africa later this year, nor to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in early 2015.

It should also be inconceivable that West Indian cricket will disintegrate altogether, with disillusioned players set free to pursue Twenty20 careers around the globe.

But it could happen. And cricket would never be the same again.
