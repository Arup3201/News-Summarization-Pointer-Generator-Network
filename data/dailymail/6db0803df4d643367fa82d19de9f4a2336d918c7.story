Montana's lawmakers have passed a bill allowing people to salvage and eat roadkill in a bid to 'stop good food going to waste'.

House Bill 247 creates permits allowing individuals to scrape game animals off the road, including antelope, deer, elk or moose.

The measure passed 19-2 last week in the House and is now set to be considered by the state Senate.

State Representative Steve Lavin, a supporter of the bill, said: 'People hit a lot of 
animals on roadways, and I mean a ton of them. There’s a
lot of good meat being wasted out there.'

Mr Lavin said animals like this bull elk will not be targeted because people will not want to damage their cars

'When people first hear about it — roadkill — some of them think this is a crazy bill, but it’s not,' Mr Lavin told the Daily Inter Lake.

Officials at Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks are concerned potentially valuable carcasses, such as those of Bighorn sheep,
 might be targeted for profit.

Mr Lavin disputed this. He added: 'People aren’t going to intentionally 
hit an elk when it’s going to cost them $1,500 in damages to their 
vehicle. Nor are poachers going to go through the problems 
of staging a road kill with the possibility of being caught. If there’s something fishy going on, we’ll catch on pretty quickly,' Lavin added.

Deer would be included in the types of animals which permit holders could legally salvage, if the Bill succeeds
