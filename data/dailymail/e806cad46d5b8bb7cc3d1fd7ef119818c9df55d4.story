Withering: Lord Rennard has questioned whether Nick Clegg is still leading a ‘major party’ following his latest by-election humiliation

Lord Rennard has questioned whether Nick Clegg is still leading a ‘major party’ following his latest by-election humiliation.

The former chief executive of the Liberal Democrats said the party’s rock-bottom showing in last week’s Rochester poll – where it came fifth with less than 1 per cent of the vote – was ‘unacceptable’.

And he warned that the latest failure makes the chances of the Lib Dems holding on to dozens of seats at the next general election much harder.

Lord Rennard’s barbed accusation that the Lib Dems are now just a minor party will be seen as revenge on Mr Clegg for not allowing him back into the heart of the party.

The Lib Dem peer, who was the party’s chief executive between 2003 and 2009, was suspended early this year after a series of women accused him of making sexual advances.

He denied the allegations, but issued an apology for encroaching on some of the women’s ‘personal space’.

In August the suspension was controversially lifted – although he was told he would have no role in next year’s election campaign.

Last week the Lib Dem candidate in Rochester and Strood, Geoff Juby, recorded the worst result of any major party since the war, garnering just 0.9 per cent of the vote and coming fifth behind the Greens. Ukip’s Mark Reckless won the seat.

A month before, the Lib Dem candidate in Clacton polled just 1.3 per cent of the vote; and last year in South Shields the Lib Dems got 1.4 per cent.

Lord Rennard – who notched up a string of by-election victories as strategy chief in the 1990s – made his comments in a blog on Facebook, entitled Reflections on Rochester.

He said the ‘result was not in my opinion unavoidable’. He added: ‘We should not allow such a result ever again, because polling the lowest vote of any major party, in any by-election ever, casts doubt on our status as a “major party”.’

Lord Rennard also criticised those in the Lib Dems who fail to grasp the enormity of the crisis engulfing the party by suggesting ‘we have been here before’.

‘No we haven’t,’ he said. ‘Not in terms of parliamentary by-elections in England anyway.’

He added: ‘To avoid such results as Rochester again, the party must change its approach to such by-elections, and to all the various sets of elections in which we need to try and sustain our support and build again for the future.’

Nick Clegg has hinted that he would be prepared to form a three-party Coalition of Labour, the Lib Dems and the Scottish Nationalists.

The surge in support for the SNP north of the border has prompted speculation that a ‘rainbow coalition’ made up of several parties may be needed after next May’s poll.

Analysis of polling data yesterday predicted neither Labour nor the Tories will be able to secure enough seats to govern with one other party.

It suggested any government would need two other parties for a majority.

Mr Clegg ruled out doing a deal with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, but declined to give a similar declaration about the SNP.
