The Leonid meteor shower is set to be visible across the East coast tonight. 

It should reach its peak before dawn on Tuesday - although experts say it will be a relatively disappointing show.

The Leonid meteor shower should produce about 10-15 meteors per hour, Nasa predicts.

A meteor from the Leonid shower, visible as a diagonal streak between the fingers of a cactus plant, is seen in this time exposure photo from early Sunday, Nov. 18, 2001, in Tucson, Arizona. Tonight shower is expected to produce around 10-15 meteors per hour, and be visible across the East coast.

To have the best chance of spotting meteors, you should go to a location away from city lights, dress warmly, lie flat on your back and look straight up, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cook. 

No special viewing equipment is needed to see the Leonid shower.

This year's shower is likely 'to be weak and there probably will be long stretches when not a single Leonid will be seen,' said Joe Rao of Space.com.

To have the best chance of spotting meteors, you should go to a location away from city lights, dress warmly, lie flat on your back and look straight up, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cook. 

No special viewing equipment is needed to see the Leonid shower, he said; it can be seen with the naked eye.

The Leonids appear to be coming from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence their name).

Skies should be clear along the East Coast for viewing the meteor shower late Monday night and early Tuesday morning. 

If forecasters are correct, the shower should produce a mild but pretty sprinkling of meteors. 

The waning crescent moon will not substantially interfere with viewing the Leonid shower.

'We're predicting 10 to 15 meteors per hour,' says Bill Cooke of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. 

Nasa recommends going to a location away from city lights, dressing warmly, and lie flat on your back and look straight up. No special viewing equipment needed — just your eyes.

'For best viewing, wait until after midnight on Nov. 18, with the peak of the shower occurring just before sunrise.'

Cooke also recommends going to a location away from city lights, dressing warmly, and lie flat on your back and look straight up. No special viewing equipment needed — just your eyes.

Leonids are bits of debris from Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Every 33 years the comet visits the inner solar system and leaves a stream of dusty debris in its wake. 

Many of these streams have drifted across the November portion of Earth's orbit. Whenever our planet hits one, meteors appear to be flying out of the constellation Leo.
