British embassies are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds to woo foreign visitors at lavish parties around the world.

Spending on entertainment and hospitality by British diplomats seems to have increased - with almost £350,000 spent by just five embassies in the last two years. 

The spending appears to resemble the parties popularised in the Ferrero Rocher adverts, where overseas guests at posh soirees are presented with the expensive chocolates and utter the infamous line 'Ambassador, you are really spoiling us.'

British embassies have spent £350,000 on entertaining guests abroad, resembling the lavish parties made famous by the Ferrero Rocher advert, where a guest utters the line 'Ambassador, you are really spoiling us' 

And it would appear that British diplomats really are spoiling their guests. 

At just five British diplomatic bases  Brazil, Mexico, Bangladesh, Turkey and Holland £210,000 was spent on entertaining in 2013.

This is an increase on £137,000 spent the year before. 

The figures were revealed by the Labour party which has called for the foreign office to justify how public money is being spent, the Sun reported.

Susan Elan Jones said: 'Ministers must justify every penny when families struggle to make ends meet.' 

Earlier this year an analysis of spending by embassies found that £16,000 was spent on cigars, while almost £3,000 went on buying flowers. 

 A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said that the money had been spent on events such as the Diamond Jubilee and London 2012 Olympic events. 

They also said some of the money had been spent on celebrations to mark the Queen's birthday as well as specialist trade events for business figures. 

The Foreign Office said this type of spending on hospitality and entertainment is justified as it will 'help secure investment and promote British business.'

She said: 'This is entirely appropriate and provides good value for money for the taxpayer.'
