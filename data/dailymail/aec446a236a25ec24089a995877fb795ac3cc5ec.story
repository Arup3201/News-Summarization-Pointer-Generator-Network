Jackson County Emergency Medical Services Supervisor Roger Wheeler told The Tribune of Seymour a pregnant woman with a cut to her head was taken to an Indianapolis hospital.

State police say about 70 passengers were on the bus and the uninjured were taken to a nearby middle school.

Police say weather conditions and speed may have contributed to the crash. 

A Megabus headed for Atlanta crashed Saturday morning on Interstate 65 in southern Indiana, authorities said, and some injuries were reported.

There were some minor injuries that were not life-threatening, but Elston did not have a specific number.

The double-decker bus was traveling from Chicago to Atlanta, according to Sean Hughes, Megabus North America Associate Director of Corporate Affairs.

Hughes did not have an exact number of how many people were on the bus at the time of the crash, but noted it had stopped in Indianapolis and had planned to also stop in Louisville, Kentucky, and Nashville and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Hughes said emergency services were at the scene and that Megabus was 'assisting the authorities with their investigation' into the accident.

In October, a Megabus following the same route was involved in a crash on I-65 just south of Indianapolis, in which several people were injured.
