The Girl Scouts have added three new cookie flavors, and two of them are gluten-free.

Toffee-tastic, a butter cookie with toffee bits, and Trios, a treat made with real peanut butter, chocolate chips and whole grain oats, both lack gluten, a protein found in wheat that many Americans avoid for health reasons.

While eliminating gluten is necessary for the 1per cent of the population with celiac disease, 25per cent of Americans have adopted a gluten-free lifestyle as a way to aid in digestive health or weight loss.

Oatmeal treat: A third Girl Scout cookie that's new this year, the Rah-Rah Raisin, is not gluten-free

In July, the New York Times reported that more than one quarter of the nation’s population said they were cutting down on gluten or avoiding it entirely – despite the fact that only 6per cent are classified as gluten intolerant.

'We believe everyone should be able to support the Girl Scout Cookie Program,' explains ABC Bakers. 'So we brought the very first 100per cent gluten free Girl Scout Cookie to market in a pilot program during the 2013-2014 Cookie Season, and the results were outstanding. Participating councils and consumers loved the new cookie, and 90per cent' of consumers said they plan to buy gluten free again next season!'

The third new Girl Scout cookie is the Rah-Rah Raisin, an oatmeal raisin variety with whole grain oats and Greek yogurt-flavored chunks.

Of course, top sellers such as Thin Mints, which account for 25per cent of sales, Samoas and Tagalongs will still be available, as will other more recent additions.

For example, the Savannah Smiles, a lemon flavored cookie named after the birthplace of Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon Low, which was introduced in 2012, is still on offer.

This has been an exciting season for the organization, which announced last month that it is going digital in its cookie sales.

After nearly 100 years of selling door to door, Girl Scouts of the USA will allow its young go-getters to push their wares using a mobile app or personalized websites - but only if their scout councils and guardians approve.

'Girls have been telling us that they want to go into this space,' Chief Digital Cookie Executive Sarah Angel-Johnson told the Associated Press in December. 

'Online is where entrepreneurship is going.'
