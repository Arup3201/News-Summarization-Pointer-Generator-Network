A retired sailor drowned himself in a harbour after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, an inquest has heard. 

Reginald Edlington White, 97, had been battling prostate cancer for several years but was told by doctors it had spread to his spine and was terminal.

Less than a week after being told the diagnosis, the former Merchant Navy seaman walked into a harbour Aberystwyth, Wales, where he was later found dead.

Inquest: Retired sailor Reginald Edlington White, 97, pictured on Remembrance Sunday in 2003, drowned himself in the sea at Aberystwyth, west Wales, after discovering his cancer was terminal

Tragedy: Witnesses tried to resuscitate Mr White after he was spotted in the water at Aberystwyth, west Wales, pictured, but he was pronounced dead

Witness Jean Calvert told the inquest: 'I saw him walking down by the slipway. At the bottom he bent down and picked things up, shells or something. I went away to make a drink and when I came back I saw him on his side and someone was trying to resuscitate him.'

Ceredigion Coroner Peter Brunton said evidence presented at the inquest left him in no doubt Mr White had intended to kill himself and returned a verdict of suicide.

Mr White’s son, Brian, said his father had spent six weeks in hospital but insisted on coming home just days before his death.

'He’d had prostate cancer for years but secondary cancer had gone to his spine,' he said. 'Social services and Macmillan said he had to have a phone and an alarm put in his house before he came home, but he had a go at me and I said okay. He was elated to come out of hospital.'

But less than a week later, on February 6, Mr White took his own life.

His son told the inquest: 'He was fiercely independent and lived on his own since my mother died in 1978.

'He came out of hospital on Thursday but on Friday he was agitated and we had to get the doctor.

Terminal: Reg White, who loved the sea and was passionate about boats, had been battling prostate cancer for years but learned it had spread to his spine less than a week before his death

'I think he knew that soon he wouldn’t be able to get out of the chair. I went to see him on Sunday and he said he didn’t want to be alive.'

On Wednesday Brian White visited again and was pleased to see his father out of bed.

He said: 'I went down early and he was up. He said he’d eaten. I said I’d be back after work but at about 4pm, officers came to say they’d found him in the harbour.'

Delivering his verdict, Mr Brunton told Brian White: 'There is something very poignant about a gentleman like your father, living through life’s vicissitudes, surviving World War II and getting to almost 98, that it should have to end this way.'

He had been a sailor in the Merchant Navy in the Second World War, Mr White was once adrift in the 
Indian Ocean for weeks after the crankshaft broke on his ship.

They eventually had to break radio silence and get tugged to South Africa for repairs.

He
went on to work as a master painter and decorator, but always retained 
his love of the sea, being a member of the Lifeboat and Coastguard crews
in Aberystwyth in the 1950s and ‘60s.

He was married to Gwyneth, 
who died in 1978, and the couple had two sons Brian and Dafydd and 
grandchildren Michelle and Leiam.

Though he had been registered 
blind 10 years ago, Mr White could still make out shapes and cycled to 
Morrisons regularly up until three months ago.

Described by friends as 'very skilful and knowledgeable', he was an expert knot-tyer, who could make beautiful arts and crafts from rope, made ships in bottles, and also previously played the guitar in several local bands.

Dai Jenkins, Treasurer of Aberystwyth RNLI, said Mr White was one of the last of his generation of 'Aberystwyth harbour rats' who loved messing about with boats down at the harbour.

'Reg would come down the harbour twice a day or walk up to the benches and sit and talk to people,' he said.

'He’d always been a keen sailor and taught me a lot when we used to go out in the boat together.

'His health and eyesight had been failing recently but he always had time for a chat and was well liked down at the harbour. I’ll miss him greatly.'

Town councillor Mair Benjamin lives on the next street to Mr White and said he was 'well loved and would be truly missed in the community'.
