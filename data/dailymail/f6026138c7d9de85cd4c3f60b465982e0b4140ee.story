The mother of a 15-year-old schoolgirl murdered by her ex-boyfriend has claimed she was plagued by disturbing nightmares of her killer in the weeks before her death.

Rebecca Aylward was killed for a bet in 2010 by Josh Davies, then 16, who lured her into woods near Bridgend, South Wales, and smashed her skull with a rock. He was later given a 14-year prison sentence for her murder.

Now Sonia Oatley, Rebecca's grieving mother, has said she had disturbing visions about Davies before he killed her daughter, even though she was completely taken in by his charms.

The 53-year-old mother, who has two other children, even recalls Davies making racist comments in her home, and longing to join the Ku Klux Klan.

She also said again that she wants the death penalty to be reinstated so that Davies can be killed for his crime.

Ms Oatley said: 'I hope someone kills him. I want him to suffer. I don't think he is brave enough for suicide. He is a coward attacking little girls and children.'

At Davies' trial, the judge described the boy's ‘deep-seated hatred’ towards Rebecca after their relationship ended.

The jury heard how he regularly told friends of his plans to kill Rebecca, who was 5ft 2in and weighed just six stone, but that they never took his boasts seriously.

The schoolboy told friends of his plots to poison her with deadly foxglove, drown her in a river or throw her off a cliff.

In one text to a friend Davies asked: ‘What would you do if I actually did kill her?' The friend replied: ‘Oh, I would buy you breakfast.’

Two days before the murder Davies sent a text saying: ‘Don’t say anything but you may just owe me a breakfast.’

On the day she was killed, Rebecca had bought a new outfit to meet Davies, thinking that they were going to get back together. She was ‘dancing and singing’ beforehand because she was excited, her sister Jessica said.

Davies, then just 15, lured Rebecca to a wooded area near his home in Aberkenfig, near Bridgend, South Wales, in October last year. He even spoke in sickening detail of the murder, telling a friend ‘the worst part of it was feeling and hearing her skull giving way’.

Ms Oatley is now plagued by nightmares. She said: 'I have constant nightmares and I relive everything. Before it happened I was having nightmares about Davies. It was always in a forest and he was always a wolf.

'I would see him running through the forest. Then it would stand up and it would turn into Davies. I still have these dreams that he is chasing Becca.'

Ms Oatley spoke of her ordeal ahead of the launch of a book she has written, called Bye Mam, I Love You - which were her daughter's last words to her.

She said: 'He could come out when he is around 30. This September he will have another 10 years. He can have a family and do it all over again then.

'He is extremely dangerous and unstable. He is capable of anything. I am very concerned about what he is learning in prison and who he is meeting.'

'He would come in the house and be full of life and be really polite, I never heard him use bad language,' she recalled.

'He started talking about how much he hated black people. We were living in Maesteg and he said he had heard there was a man there who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. He wanted to join him. He told us, "I want to meet him, I want to go out and get blacks."'

'Rebecca's death is on my mind every minute of the day. I cannot get away from it. I have got photos everywhere all over the house. I will never let it be forgotten.'
