From the squeak of a door to the sound of a bus and the song of a bird, the noises around you are unique to your environment - and all of them make up the Earth's 'voice.'

To catalogue millions of these individual ambient noises, a university researcher from Indiana is using microphones and sensors to capture ‘every sound the Earth makes’.

His project is designed to preserve the world's changing sounds, and they can also reveal clues about environmental damage.

These public sounds can be explored on the Global Soundscapes map, and sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording and type of sounds, as well as the location and date

Later this month, a series of microphones and sensors in Indiana will go online, designed to capture ambient sounds in the region.

It follows the launch of the Global Soundscapes project, set up by Purdue professor Bryan Pijanowski in April, to coincide with Earth Day 2014.

Both projects are designed to capture millions of natural sound recordings, which people around the world can take part in using the Global Soundscapes app for iOS and Android.

The Global Soundscapes map features recordings made using the iOS and Android app.

These public sounds can be explored by clicking red dots on the map. 

Yellow stars link through to separate databases that feature numerous sounds from a selected location. 

All the sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording and type of sounds, as well as the location and date.

People can also use the map to listen specific sounds, depending on their mood. 

For example, the recordings can be filtered by sounds that ‘make me happy’ or ‘stress me out.’

They can additionally listen to the existinglibrary of 500,000 natural soundscape recordings from sites in Indiana, Costa Rica and elsewhere. 

All the recordings are added to a database of sounds Professor Pijanowski and his fellow researchers have been collecting since 1996.

Sounds captured include a dawn chorus in a tropical rainforest in Madagascar, the sound of an ant colony, howls of grey wolves in Algonquin National Park in Ontario, Canada, and urban noises recorded an intersection in Tippecanoe County near the Purdue University campus.

Elsewhere, the Global Soundscapes map features more everyday sounds, including cars driving in Arizona and trains in Austria.

Professor Pijanowski said the project shines a ‘spotlight on the importance of natural soundscapes and the potential for growing research.

The app is available for iOS (pictured) and Android, and users also have the option of taking pictures of the soundscapes or landscapes they are recording.

‘Our aim is to get people from all walks of life and from across the world to record their soundscapes and to answer questions related to how they relate to them.

‘We hope to use these collected soundscapes to change the sound of public spaces, hospitals and other venues, replacing them with sounds that make us feel good, sounds that are peaceful and restful.’

Additionally, Professor Pijanowski and his team claim sound recordings can help identify changes in climate and the environment.

He told The Verge he believes he’ll be able to hear changes in the soundscape as the climate evolves. 

Previous research has been able to identify dying coral reefs because the fish and other creatures have been quieter, or in some cases, silent, for example.

‘As I travel around the world, visiting remote nature parks, it is quite apparent to me that the quality of natural sounds is decreasing as habitats are degraded and animals go extinct,’ added Professor Pijanowski.

‘Sadly, we also are replacing these sounds with those made by humans, as noise from planes and cars penetrate deep into wild places on this planet.’

The app is available for iOS and Android, and users also have the option of taking pictures of the soundscapes or landscapes they are recording.
