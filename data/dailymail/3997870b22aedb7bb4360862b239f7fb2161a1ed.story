A four-year-old boy with autism from New York who went missing while visiting family in South Carolina has been found dead this morning, authorities say.

Coroner Robert Edge told local media outlets that Jayden Morrison was found in a pond in Little River.

Emergency workers in Little River on the South Carolina coast searched for the child who went missing on Christmas Eve and was last seen wearing red footie pajamas.

Area media outlets report rescue workers and volunteers searched until 1 a.m. on Christmas Day for Jayden Morrison. 

He was last seen at his grandmother's house about 6 p.m. on Wednesday.

An Horry County Police dispatcher says the search resumed about 7 a.m. Thursday.

The child's mother, Tabatha Morrison, tells reporters the family arrived at her mother's house on Christmas Eve day just hours earlier from New York.

She says her son is autistic and wouldn't respond if his name was called.

Before he was found dead, Jayden's mother said he likely would not be able to find his way home because he is not familiar with his grandmother's neighborhood.

'He’s never done anything like this before,' Morrison told the Sun News. 

'He’s 4 years old. He’s never been out of my eyesight.'

Morrison  left earlier on Christmas Eve day to go Walmart to buy toys for Christmas gifts.

She decided not to bring gifts from New York because they wouldn't fit in the car.

'Mom called me at the store and said she couldn't find him,' Morrison said. 

Morrison said she frantically rushed back home and when she got there some emergency workers already were there. 

She searched the neighborhood but never found her son Jayden, she said.

'The houses here all look the same,' she said. 

'At home he would be able to point out his house,' she said.

Authorities previously narrowed the search to the Little River area near Highway 111 and Horseshoe Road, north of U.S. 17.
