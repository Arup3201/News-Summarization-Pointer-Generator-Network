Former Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard has been voted Player of the Month for September by Manchester City fans after an impressive start to his loan spell at the club.

The 36-year-old edged out England midfielder James Milner and Spain's David Silva for the honour, the club confirmed today.

Lampard's impact has vindicated the surprise move by City manager Manuel Pellegrini to offer him a six-month loan deal after he left Chelsea following 13 trophy-laden years to join New York City FC.

Lampard endeared himself to City fans when he scored a dramatic late equaliser in the Premier League clash against his old club in September.

Lampard netted against Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup and showed his eye for goal again in City's 4-2 win at Hull City.

He is due to join City's affiliate club New York in January but there is already speculation that his stay in north-west England could be extended by a month.

'There has been a lot said about when the season starts, but the only thing that can decide my future is how well I am playing. They will be kicking me out in January if I don't play very well,' Lampard stated. 

'I am just looking game to game and trying to play as well as I can.'
