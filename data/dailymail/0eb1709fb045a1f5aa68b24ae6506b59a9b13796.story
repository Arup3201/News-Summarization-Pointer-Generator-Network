ESPN host Hannah Storm was not quite ready for her close-up on SportsCenter on Sunday - and was caught wrestling her makeup artist out of the camera shot after realizing they were on TV.

As a segment about Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers played during the show on Sunday morning, Storm used the brief break to get her makeup touched up.

But when cameras returned to Storm, she was in the middle of having her lipstick reapplied - and saw no option but to strong-arm the woman off the screen.

The veteran anchor, 52, was clearly shocked at being caught and stared at the camera wide-eyed before she broke into a smile and continued her broadcast.

But the slip-up didn't go unnoticed, with viewers rushing to social media to point out the error. Storm herself also took to social media to explain the mishap. 

'The makeup artist (a good friend of mine) would have gotten in major trouble had she been seen on air. Hence, the stiff arm to protect her,' she claimed on Sunday morning.

Storm was reporting from Texas, where the National Championship game will be played tonight.

It comes a week after the anchor was praised for her professionalism as she announced the death of fellow anchor Stuart Scott, who passed away on January 4.

He had been diagnosed with cancer in 2007. 

'Today we choose not to say that Stuart lost to cancer at the age of 49,' she told viewers as she struggled to control her emotions. 'Instead, we’ll simply say we all lost Stuart.'

Storm and Scott had worked together on SportsCenter for more than 10 years.
