Marine biologists are working to uncover what caused several thousand Humboldt squid to wash ashore along the Santa Cruz County shoreline on Sunday.

Thousands of squid carcasses are littering the 12 mile stretch of coastline from Aptos to Watsonville, where the high tide may have had something do to with the sea creatures essentially committing mass suicide.

The general public is advised by scientists not to touch or eat the squid, as they may contain dangerous toxins.

Scientists including Hanna Rosen believe the squid may have consumed toxic algae

Hanna Rosen, a graduate student at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, told San Francisco’s CBS affiliate that she saw people trying to put the squid back in the sea, only to watch them return to the beach.

‘They don’t see the shore very often,’ Rosen said. ‘So it might just be that they don’t understand what’s going on around them, and they’re just trying to get away and don’t realize that if they swim towards the shore, they’re going to run out of water eventually.’

Scientists from Stanford said the squid were predominantly juveniles as adult Humboldt squid can grow up to six-feet long and 100 pounds. They added that the squid were probably conceived and born in Monterey Bay, but were unable to navigate their way out to open waters.

Tests have shown that the stranded squid were well-fed from feasting on smaller market squid and cannibalizing each other, which is normal behavior for the creatures.

Sunday’s phenomenon marks the third squid stranding in the past six weeks, from Santa Cruz to Pacific Grove. Marine biologists are currently analyzing the contents of the animals’ stomachs to see if they ingested something that might have disoriented them.

One theory under consideration is that the squid were disorientated after consuming toxic algae.

‘It is possible that the squid are 
ingesting these zero toxins or getting them through their food which is 
causing them to be disorientated and swim unto the beach,’ said Rosen.

Scientists have found traces of domoic acid, a toxin produced by algae, in some of the beached squid, but the findings are so far inconclusive.

Humboldt squid have not been observed in the Monterey Bay waters for a few years, making recent events all the more suspicious. Some scientists attribute the phenomenon to this year’s El Nino weather patterns, which could have attracted them to the cooler climates of Northern and Central California’s coast.

Conservation of the Humboldt squid off 
the coast of California is not a major concern because the squid can 
reproduce in mass numbers.
