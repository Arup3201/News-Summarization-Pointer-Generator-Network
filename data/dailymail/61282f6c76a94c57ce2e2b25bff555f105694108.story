She is a long-limbed, lithe supermodel whose face and figure have 
made her a fortune.

But while Devon-born model and actress Rosie 
Huntington-Whiteley was no doubt blessed with staggeringly good genes, a
good deal of hard work goes into maintaining that perfect figure (yes, 
really).

The man masterminding the wellness regime that helps Rosie stay
fit and firm?  James Duigan, founder of Bodyism gym and author of the 
best-selling Clean & Lean diet book series.

It's not all good genes, you know! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley maintanis her supermodel physique thanks to regular training sessions with Bodyism's wellness guru James Duigan

Duigan is an advocate of 'clean and lean' living: nutritious, natural 
food with no added sugar or additives - and an exercise programme a 
world away from the punitive blood, sweat and tears approach that is 
off-putting to so many.

Red alert: Rosie announced the live Twitter chat to her followers last night

Future of fitness: James uses Twitter as a way to motivate and connect with his clients

Any questions (within reason!): It's open season - fire your questions off at Duigan at 6pm today

His is a simple plan that is easy to follow - and devotees see results 
fast.

His clients at his world class gym at London's Bulgari hotel - who include Hugh Grant and a host of Victoria's 
Secret girls as well as Rosie - complement fresh food (his recipes are 
as far from ascetic as you can get - think the sort of dishes you'd cook
at a dinner party) with their own specially devised exercise programme 
that uses combinations of cardio and resistance - bandwalking, lunges, 
squats - to burn fat and create long, lean limbs.

This afternoon at 6pm (UK time) Duigan will take to Twitter to share his wisdom, and will 
be answering any questions (within reason!) you have always wanted 
answered.

Rosie will join James online for the live Q&A - and  is 
set to share the secrets that go into maintaining a supermodel physique.

Be sure not to miss out...

James will be on Twitter at 6pm GMT today (Thursday 4 October) to answer all your questions on fitness and diet. Follow him @JamesDuigan and follow Rosie at @RHW
