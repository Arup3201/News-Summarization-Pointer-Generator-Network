The worst motorists drive on Tuesdays in September, between six and nine in the morning, according to a new stusy on the causes of road rage.

And the worst offenders are people who weave in and out of traffic and cut people up.

Researchers from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Canada analysed 5,624 complaints made over an eight-year period on community site Roadragers.com.

There are more incidents of road rage on Tuesdays in September, according to research from Canada. Weaving in and out of traffic, cutting people up, speeding and making rude hand gestures are among the most common complaints

This site is no longer live, but others including Driver-Ratings.com and PlateWire can also be used to post road rage complaints.

All the complaints analysed for the study were made by drivers in North America.

The research team, led by Dr. Christine Wickens, coded each complaint for 16 specific behaviours.

Top 10 worst road rage offences:

Weaving/Cutting (25 per cent)

Speeding (13 per cent)

Hostile display (11.7 per cent)

Tailgating (11.4 per cent)

Lane usage (6.5 per cent)

No turn signal (6.3 per cent)

Erratic braking (5.5 per cent)

Traffic signs/signals (4.16 per cent)

Blocking (4.14 per cent)

Violent display (3.7 per cent)

These behaviours included weaving and cutting, speeding, driving too close, hostile and violent behaviour, driving too slow, using mobile phones while driving, not indicating properly, and more.

Most complaints contained more than one of these types of behaviour.

'Hostile driver display' included swearing and rude hand gestures.

These behaviours appeared in more than 11 per cent of all complaints. 

This put it third in the list of most annoying incidents, just behind speeding.

Violent display included physical and threatening behaviour.

This was listed as chasing, getting out of the car to argue, waving a gun or weapon, and throwing objects.

There were 421 examples of this type of behaviour found in multiple complaints.

Wickens also looked at how many complaints were made on each day of the week.

Plus, the total number of complaints made in each month of the year.

The most road rage incidents happen on a Tuesday. The most peaceful day on the road is Sunday

Tuesday had the most complaints with 984, compared to Sunday with the lowest with 425.

The worst month for road rage incidents was September.

The most relaxed month to drive was June.

As you might expect, the worst time to drive was at rush hour during the morning, with evening rush hour coming in second.

Drivers in September reported more road rage incidents than in any other month. June was the best month to be on the road

And there were 108 complaints made about drivers between the hours of midnight and three am.

According to the study, aggressive driving is said to be the cause of half of all car accidents in the US.

The researchers plan to use the study’s findings about the worst driving offences, and how often they happen, to teach new drivers about road crimes and how to avoid them.
