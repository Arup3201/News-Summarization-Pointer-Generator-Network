A distraught mother who died with her three-year-old son after dragging him underneath a train, wrote a series of harrowing messages in which she told how she was 'so scared I don't know who I am any more'.

Donna Oettinger, 41, had taken blond-haired Zaki to the railway station at the end of her road during the morning rush hour. The little boy only celebrated his third birthday a week ago.

In another of the internet messages, Oettinger, who suffered anxiety attacks and depression, wrote: 'Thank God I have my son Zaki. I owe him a lot when I get better. Love you son with all my heart xxx'.

Incident: Donna Oettinger and her three-year-old son Zackary, nicknamed 
Zaki, are both believed to have been killed at 
Riddlesdown Station near Purley, Surrey this morning

Tragedy: Donna's child Zaki had just celebrated his third birthday according to neighbours, and was much-loved in their street just 300 metres from the station where they 
died

Miss Oettinger, who worked for a haulage company, was understood to have been suffering from severe depression.

She had been battling anxiety since 
May last year and had been prescribed medication to fight it. 
Unfortunately, her treatment did not seem to be working. She wrote a 
message to friends on Facebook which said: ‘So scared. Don’t know who I 
am any more.’

And in another she said: ‘Feeling so depressed. Dread waking up.’

Scene: The train involved in the incident can be seen at a standstill at Riddlesdown train station near Croydon, South London, as emergency services arrive at the scene

Tragedy: Yellow markers can be seen along the railway track at 
Riddlesdown station where they died

Named: Donna Oettinger is understood to have killed herself and her son Zaki at Riddlesdown Station this morning

She added: 'Feeling so depressed with this f****** severe anxiety. Dread waking up.

'The tragedy took place at  Riddlesdown Station near Purley, in Surrey.

One rail worker, who did not want to be named, said the driver was in a state of shock.

The mother and son were killed when they were hit by the train.

Passengers were ordered to stay in 
their carriages for more than 90 minutes after the double fatality. 
Commuter Paul Camlett, 38, said: ‘I had just arrived at the station when
the station master rounded everyone up and ordered them off the 
platform.

‘I’m in complete shock. People were crying.’

Last night detectives were searching Miss Oettinger’s house, which is 300 yards from the station.

One neighbour said: ‘I heard about 
two fatalities on the radio this morning but I had no idea it was them. 
Poor Zaki. I’ve only just moved in but I have seen the mother a few 
times. Zaki was such a sweet little boy. Always so happy.

‘I saw her just yesterday, I’m a child-minder and she saw me with two screaming children – she looked at me with pity.

‘She was always rushing around with 
him. Last time I saw her his blanket was hanging down, I told her 
because it was getting dirty.

‘It’s a real tragedy. To hear this 
I’m just in shock.’ Miss Oettinger was understood to have lived with her
mother Carol. Last night her relatives were too upset to talk about 
their loss.

Zaki’s father Mohamed Nasr is understood to be an Egyptian who lives in Sharm el Sheikh.

Detective Chief Inspector Iain 
Miller, of British Transport Police, said: ‘Officers are continuing to 
work to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident
