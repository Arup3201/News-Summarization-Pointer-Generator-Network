A Department of Homeland Security employee who was unmasked in August as a radical black nationalist who publicly called for an all-out war against with the white race is no longer employed by the agency, it was revealed today.  

Ayo Kimathi, an acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement handling small businesses, was placed on administrative leave four months ago after it was revealed that he has been using his website, WarOnTheHorizon.com, to advocate for the mass murder of Caucasians.

The site includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race.' Kimathi is black.

Good riddance: Ayo Kimathi finally left his job as acquisitions officer 
for Immigration and Customs Enforcement some four months after it
 was discovered that he has been moonlighting as an advocate for a race 
war

Hate speech: Kimathi, who is black, operates the website War on the Horizon, which includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race'

On Wednesday, DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen confirmed to National Journal that Kimathi left the agency December 6. She would not specify, however, whether he resigned or was fired, citing privacy policies. 

'This is welcome but long overdue news,' said Josh Glasstetter, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which exposed Kimathi's double life over the summer.

'DHS had known for months about Kimathi's promotion of violence. Some of his coworkers reportedly feared for their own safety. Regrettably, DHS only took action after we publicized his activities.'

Kimathi was hired by DHS in 2009, and last year he drew an annual salary of more than $115,000. 

On the side, the federal employee has been running a website criticizing whites, gays, those of mixed race, and blacks who integrate with whites. In his lectures and speeches, some of them available on YouTube, Kimathi heaped abuse on President Obama for his support of gay rights, calling him a ‘goddamn f***** mulatto.’

The SPLC in August reported on Kimathi's role in operating the radical web portal.

Hostile: A former manager at DHS said that 'everybody in the office is afraid' of Kimatha

'At this point in history, whites worldwide are threatening the existence of every Black man, woman, and child on Earth,' one passage on the site read.

'Since we are the most valuable people
 alive and there is no need for this planet’s existence without us, it 
is time for us to prepare for the international war for Black survival.'

Kimathi,
 who calls himself 'the irritated Genie,' received permission to launch 
the site after falsely telling his supervisors at the DHS that War on the 
Horizon was set up to sell concert and lecture videos.

Author: Kimathi wrote a book under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees on the subject of the effeminization of the black male by whites, which retails on Amazon for more than $756

‘He called it simply WOH, never saying that WOH stood for War on the Horizon,’ the report stated.

DHS spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said in a written statement that the agency ‘does not condone any type of hateful rhetoric or advocacy of violence of any kind against anyone.’

The Alabama-based SPLC said in its report that Kimathi's site declares: ‘in order for Black people to survive the 21st century, we are going to have to kill a lot of whites – more than our Christian hearts can possibly count.'

A former manager at DHS reportedly told SPLC that 'everybody in the office is afraid of him,' adding that his co-workers have expressed concerns that one day, Kimathi would bring a gun 'and go postal.'

His hate-filled rhetoric aside, however, Kimathi’s ex-supervisor described him as a ‘suave’ professional with a ‘commanding presence’ who excelled at his job advocating for small business owners.

The radical activist appears to have a long list of enemies, among them Rev. Al Sharpton, Lil Wayne, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, dubbed by him ‘Colon,’ and the long-deceased FBI director ‘Gay Edgar Hoover.’

Besides preparing members of the black
 race for war on whites, Kimathi also has been going after gays and 
lesbians, while accusing the US government of pursuing a secret agenda 
of trying to ‘effeminize’ the black male as a way of destroying the race.

In a lengthy blog post that was uploaded on the radical site November 1, the writer accused the Obama administration of pressuring Lincoln University and other historically black colleges to promote homosexuality to student body - or risk losing their funding.

In September, another post addressed the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin. The author of the foul-mouthed communique referred to the defendant as a 'zionist smallhat' while calling the victim 'Brother Trayvon.'

Anti-gay: Lomathi lambasted President Obama for his support of LGBT community in 2009 speech

Harsh words: Kimathi said he was disillusioned with Michelle Obama for wearing a 'lingerie'-style dress on the cover of People magazine

A book on the subject titled ‘War on the Horizon: Black Resistance to the white-sex Assault,’ which was apparently written by Kimathi under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees, retails on Amazon for more than $756, the Huffington Post reported.

In a particularly incendiary video from August 2009 posted on his YouTube page, which was unearthed by the site Mediate, Kimathi delivered a racially charged and homophobic speech blasting President Obama as a' goddamn f***** mullato' for his efforts to extend rights to members of the LGBT community.

Dressed in a gold-colored African garb with an amulet around his neck, Kimathi raged against Obama, whom he repeatedly called 'f**' and 'miserable, low-life, scum-dwelling product of the Europeans’ for his decision to designate June 2009 as National LGBT Pride Month.

Kimathi also did not spare the first 
lady, saying that he had started out admiring Michelle Obama as an 
articulate black woman, but was later disillusioned with her after 
seeing the cover of People magazine that featured the mother of two 
sporting a pink lacy dress with a V-neck, which he labelled 'lingerie.'

‘Damn, these crackers got us! They got a f***** and a sister who's out of control, and they're embarrassing us around the world,' he cried.
