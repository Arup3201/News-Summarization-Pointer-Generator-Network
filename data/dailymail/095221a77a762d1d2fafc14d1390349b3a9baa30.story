Hong Kong's leader Leung Chun-ying has claimed that 'external forces' are behind the violent protests that have rocked the territory.

Chief Executive Leung said in a televised statement yesterday that he believes foreign powers are involved in the unrest, echoing accusations made by China.

But the students behind the pro-democracy protests firmly denied the claim, saying that Leung was 'just making it up'.

Speaking in a televised interview, Leung said: 'There is obviously participation by people, organisations from outside of Hong Kong.'

He added that foreign actors came from 'different countries in different parts of the world', but did not specify where.

China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei repeated the claims today. 

He said: 'Everybody has seen the fact that some people and some forces from the outside are indeed making attempts at interfering in Hong Kong's affairs in order to affect Hong Kong's development, and the fact that they have gone so far as to encourage, instigate and support illegal activities.' 

But the Hong Kong Federation of Students, backing the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have been occupying parts of central Hong Kong for more than three weeks, said Leung and China were 'just making it up'.

Secretary general Alex Chow said: 'He's the chief executive, he's an accountable official. If he's putting forward these accusations, then we hope he also puts forward the evidence. But he shouldn't just say that foreign powers are meddling without evidence.'

The protesters, who are mainly students, are pushing for a greater say in choosing the territory's leader in their first direct election, promised by China for 2017.

They oppose Beijing's ruling that all people who intend to run have to be screened by Chinese officials first.

Leung's statement comes just before his government is scheduled to hold talks with student leaders on Tuesday. 

However, a resolution is unlikely as the Chief Executive has already said that Beijing is not going to give in to the students' demands.

Last night was largely peaceful, however the two nights before saw violent clashes and running battles between protesters and the police. 

The police tried to drive away the students during the night, only to seem them regroup and reoccupy the centre of the city.

This has become an almost daily pattern, as the police make little progress on forcing the group to disperse.

A 23-year-old demonstrator was arrested yesterday, the first person suspected of inciting protests online.

The unnamed protester 'incited others on an online forum to join the unlawful assembly in Mong Kok, to charge at police and to paralyze the railways', police spokesman Steve Hui said.

The arrest raised concerns among human rights activists that police have so far refused to disclose what the suspect's posts say or who revealed the man's identity and location to investigators.

Maya Wang, a China researcher with Human Rights Watch, said: 'There clearly are some concerns about the impacts it could have on free speech.

'The police would have to explain what the post actually says and how it contravenes the law.'
