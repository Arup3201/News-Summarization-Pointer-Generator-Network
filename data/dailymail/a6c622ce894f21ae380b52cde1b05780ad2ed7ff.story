Forget being a man's best friend, this friendly hound can't get enough of her baby companion.

Lola the English bulldog was filmed in action as she joined her tiny pal Mila for a keyboard session.

With an adult on hand, the canine is seen pressing the keys on a musical toy and leaning over to shower her duet partner with kisses.

'I feel the beat it's really sweet, I feel the music in my feet,' the lyrics of a dance track sound.

Mila is heard gurgling and laughing as the animal nuzzles her face.

Her parents stay close to ensure the two maintain a safe distance.

At the end of the clip, Lola continues to lick the baby with no sign of stopping.

Apparently the two playmates have been best friends since the little Mila was brought home from the hospital. They often play together with Lola lovingly licking her.

The duo live in the San Francisco Bay Area of California.
