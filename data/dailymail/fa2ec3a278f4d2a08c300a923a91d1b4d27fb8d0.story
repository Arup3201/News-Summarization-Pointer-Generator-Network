A boy of 15 who robbed a bank may have been acting out a video game, a judge said yesterday.

The teenager burst into a branch of Barclays and pointed a fake handgun at terrified cashiers while demanding cash.

He shouted: ‘I’m not f****** messing around – I’ve just got out of prison after five years’ before fleeing with £2,200.

District judge Ian Lomax said the child may have been influenced by something he had ‘been watching or playing’.

‘It’s a bizarre, surreal case of a young man almost acting like a real-life action video game – nevertheless it was a robbery,’ the judge added.

He said the case was very unusual because the boy was a model pupil who had not been in trouble with the police.

Studies show ultra-violent games can lead to copycat behaviour among teenagers. Grand Theft Auto V, the latest game in a notorious series, was released last week to massive controversy.

Despite its 18-rating critics say it will be played by millions of impressionable teenagers unprepared for graphic depictions of torture, murder and sex.

Minutes after the game went on sale, 
yobs mugged a fan who was one of the first to buy it, battering him over
 the head with a brick and knifing him in the back.

It
 has also emerged that Aaron Alexis, the gunman who killed 12 people in a
 rampage through a Washington naval base, was an obsessive player of 
violent video games such as Call Of Duty and Resident Evil.

Robbery: The boy made off with more than £2,000 following the raid but was handed over to the police by his mother who was shocked to find a stash of cash, stained with dye, and a fake firearm in his bedroom

Nicolas Robinson, associate professor in politics and video games research at the University of Leeds, said: ‘You do have to be 18 to buy Grand Theft Auto but do these games end up in the hands of kids who shouldn’t be playing them? The answer to that is absolutely yes.

'It's a bizarre, surreal case of a young man almost acting like a real-life action video game. Nevertheless it was a robbery' 

‘Kids should be protected from certain content. I believe Grand Theft Auto is a very sophisticated satirical piece of work – and most kids under 18 just won’t get the satire. And if you don’t get the satire, it’s actually much more problematic than if you do.’

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are fuelling violence among primary school children.

In the case of the young robber, Liverpool Youth Court heard he was confronted by his mother after she found the cash and the fake gun in his bedroom.

He immediately admitted the crime and his family took him to the nearest police station where he made a confession.

The boy, whose identity is protected by law, told officers he had staked out the Anfield bank before disguising himself in a hooded top and scarf around his face.

However the money he took last Friday was stained by an anti-theft dye timed to explode when a robber leaves a bank.

Debra Chan, prosecuting, said: ‘He wanted the money because he was jealous of other people who had material things he wanted.’ She added that he was a ‘model pupil, in the top set who attends every day’ and who was now facing a ‘substantial custodial sentence’.

Although not injured, the two bank staff involved in the case were said to be traumatised by their ordeal. During his police interview, the boy apologised for what he had done.

Esther Leach, defending, said: ‘He is doing fantastically well at school. He comes from a very, very good family.’

The boy pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. His mother was in court and wept as he stepped into the dock wearing a black suit.

Sending the case to Liverpool Crown Court for sentence, judge Lomax said the boy had been ‘motivated by greed and immaturity’.

He added: ‘This is a very serious matter. It’s an armed robbery but not in the conventional sense most people would recognise. You knew with hindsight it was an imitation firearm but the tellers clearly didn’t know that and handed over cash in fear of being shot.’

The judge made no mention of any specific video games.

He granted the teenager conditional bail until he is sentenced on October 15.
