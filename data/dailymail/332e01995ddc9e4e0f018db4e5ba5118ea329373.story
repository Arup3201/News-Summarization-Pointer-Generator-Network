Margarine giant Flora has become embroiled in a homophobia row after launching an advertising campaign that appears to liken a parent's perceived anguish at being told their child is gay to a bullet through the heart.

On a pink background, the advert depicts the words 'uhh dad, I'm gay' fashioned into the shape of a bullet as it flies through the air towards a human heart made of china.

At the bottom of the poster, next to Flora's famous logo, appear the words: 'You need a strong heart today.'

Homophobic: On a pink background, the advert depicts the words 'uhh dad, I'm gay' fashioned into the shape of a bullet as it flies through the air towards a human heart made of china

'Edgy': The campaign, by Lowe + Partners Johannesburg, also has a similar advert referencing the Kama Sutra

Flora, which is owned by consumer goods firm Unilever, has come under a barrage of criticism from gay rights groups who claim the advert, which is believed to be from South Africa, is homophobic.

A spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall said: 'Many people will clearly find this advert offensive and inappropriate.

'Perhaps Flora should have a chat with their Unilever colleagues, Ben & Jerry, about how best to produce gay friendly advertising fit for the 21st century.'

Last month ice cream maker Ben&Jerry's renamed their Cookie Dough flavour to 'I Dough, I dough', in support of same-sex marriage in Australia.

Some people took to Twitter yesterday to vent their frustration at the advert's connotations.

Jamie Rowe wrote: 'Dear @Unilever - great work with the homophobic Flora advert, d****ebags.

Flora is owned by consumer goods firm Unilever, whose many products also include Marmite, Wall's and pot Noodle

Sam Alden added: 'F*** Flora and their homophobic advert. How does that still even happen?'

The campaign, apparently the brainchild of Lowe + Partners Johannesburg, also has a similar advert referencing the Kama Sutra.

Flora, sold in the UK, Czech Republic, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Poland,
 Hungary, Portugal, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand and 
Australia, has for years been marketed as containing ingredients that provide for a healthy heart.

A Unilever spokesperson said: 'This advert was prepared by an external agency in South Africa and was not approved by anyone at Unilever.

'The advert is offensive and unacceptable and we have put an immediate stop to it. Unilever is proud of the support that our brands have given to LGBT people, including our recent campaign for Ben & Jerryâ€™s on equal marriage.'
