The FA have strongly defended England 2018’s level of co-operation with Michael Garcia’s World Cup bid corruption report after an MP claimed they withheld vital evidence.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he had ‘very serious’ questions and intended to write to bid officials asking them to hand over their database of bid information to Parliament.

This follows the DCMS publishing a dossier, compiled by the Sunday Times, said to contain information the FA failed to make available.

The FA insist they disclosed every document and only withheld hearsay, gossip and rumour — and this was done with the agreement of ethics investigator Garcia.

An FA statement said: ‘The FIFA ethics committee made specific requests and responding to these involved searching in excess of half-a-million documents. The search parameters were established with Mr Garcia’s office. All documents within the search parameters were disclosed.’

The dossier accuses Russia and Qatar, who are hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups respectively, of vote-trading and vote-buying while England are alleged to have colluded in a botched vote-swap with South Korea. Former FA chairman Geoff Thompson made the agreement to swap votes with Chung Moon-joon, the South Korean representative on the FIFA ExCo. FIFA rules allowed such a deal between ExCo members but not by bid teams.

Thompson is said to have voted for South Korea to host the 2022 World Cup but Chung reneged on the pact. This was known the next day, when England named the five traitors, including Chung, who had not delivered their promised support.

Ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert cleared Russia and Qatar earlier this month to host the World Cups, based on Garcia’s findings. Since then Garcia has disowned Eckert’s summary of his report and the file has been passed to FIFA compliance chief Domenico Scala to decide what more is made public.
