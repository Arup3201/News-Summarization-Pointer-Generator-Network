Arsene Wenger was accused of disrespecting his former club Monaco as Arsenal produced yet another familiar evening of agonising failure in the last 16 of the Champions League.

Despite winning 2-0 in Monaco and producing an exhilarating finale as they pushed for the elusive third goal they needed, Wenger's team ultimately ended up out of the competition at this stage of the Champions League for the fifth successive year.

And to add to their woes Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim accused Wenger and Arsenal of disrespecting him and his club after not congratulating Monaco following their 3-1 victory in the first-leg at the Emirates.

The Portuguese manager left without shaking Wenger's hand after his side's progressed to the quarter-finals and said: 'It's true in first leg when I wanted to shake a hand, Wenger didn't thank me and shake my hand. So this time even though Monaco did everything for Arsenal, I decided not to thank him.

Asked whether Wenger was disrespectful, Jardim said: 'I think so and right now we're celebrating and we think that Arsenal maybe didn't show all the respect that they should have in the first leg.

'Arsenal were very happy to play Monaco as we were supposed to be one of the weakest teams. All the teams in the last 16 wanted to play against Monaco. Maybe Arsenal thought they had qualified already.'

The row completed a bitterly disappointing night for Arsenal which ended in the usual glorious defeat over the two legs with Wenger admitting that his team had paid the price for a calamitous first-leg performance.

Olivier Giroud's 36th minute goal and Aaron Ramsey's strike in 79th minute gave Arsenal hope in a night on which they attacked throughout and did their utmost – but ultimately the damage had been done three weeks ago.

The Arsenal manager said: 'Football is not a fairytale. It's just a matter of being realistic and clinical and Monaco were clinical in front of goal and maybe a bit lucky as well. The performance was enough today but of course we had difficult task I believe as well it could have been over at half time with the chances we had.

'Overall we paid for fact that we didn't produce game we wanted in the first leg. They surprised as first leg too sure of ourselves. But Monaco played at home tonight and had zero shots on target. We knew before game we had a 98 per chance to go out. We did fight but I felt some players were jaded offensively as given a lot of Saturday and lacked bit of freshness.' 

The anguish of their repeated failures at this stage of competition was expressed by defender Laurent Koscielny, who said: 'We say same thing every year. Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right and play well in two games.'

Wenger's team have now gone out in the last 16 for five years running with their exit often accompanied by lamentable first legs and spectacular yet fruitless comebacks. Ultimately Monaco will be filed alongside the 3-0 home win against AC Milan in 2012 and the 2-0 win at Bayern Munich in 2013 as yet another brave failure.

Wenger said: 'It's difficult to compare to the previous years because before we played against Bayern and Barcelona. We're very disappointed to be out tonight but overall we're on positive trend and this game on line with what we did recently.

Ramsey said: 'We came here and have nearly done it but that seems to be the case every year.'
