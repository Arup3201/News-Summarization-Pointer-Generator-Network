Raffle prizes stolen from a garden centre - including a giant teddy bear - have been recovered by police and returned just in time for Christmas.

Staff at Goulds Garden Centre in Weymouth, Dorset, were left devastated after thieves broke in and stole prizes lined up for a Christmas Eve charity raffle.

The fundraiser was being organised in memory of a much-loved colleague who had recently died from breast cancer.

CCTV footage showed the moment prizes for a raffle - including a giant teddy bear - were taken from a garden centre in Weymouth

But thieves made off with the prizes, including a large furry teddy bear, from a stand clearly explaining the meaning behind the raffle.

After a police appeal, donations of money and gifts had been flowing into the garden centre.

And today staff told of their delight at receiving the news that the stolen items had been recovered - 14 days after they went missing.

Operations manager Penny Corp-Palmer was left speechless, saying: 'I don't really know what to say at the moment.

'That's just amazing - something we never would have expected.'

She added: 'It's been so lovely to have so many people being positive about things. They really have made it a special Christmas for us all.' 

Police said they had found the stolen items and officers returned them to the centre in time for their fundraising raffle draw

Police said they had found the stolen items and police constable Nick Gravenor returned them to the centre in time for their fundraising raffle draw.

Staff had been left on the verge of tears after thieves struck at the garden centre.

The raffle had been organised in memory of their colleague Lyn Weaver, who passed away in October following a battle with breast cancer.

They hoped to raise as much money as possible for Cancer Research UK and Mosaic 

A spokeswoman for Dorset Police said: 'A 26-year-old man from Wimborne was arrested on Tuesday December 23 on suspicion of theft offences and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.'
