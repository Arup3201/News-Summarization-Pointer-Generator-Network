Matthew Cisneros, 13, was found dead at his home in Garland, Texas, on February 26

A 12-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of his 13-year-old friend in Garland, Texas, last month.

Cops initially considered Matthew Cisneros’ death a possible suicide after responding to a 911 call on February 26.

When police and paramedics arrived in the Dallas suburb they found 13-year-old Cisneros dead from an apparent gunshot wound and a gun on the ground beside him.

Joe Harn with Garland Police said it wasn’t immediately certain if the shooting was self-inflicted, reports CBSDFW.

A subsequent investigation revealed the victim and a 12-year-old friend had been playing with the gun inside Cisneros' home and the friend didn’t realize it was loaded when the trigger was pulled, said Harn on Monday.

Detectives arrested the 12-year-old boy in connection with Cisneros' death on March 20.

He now faces a manslaughter charge. His identity has not been released because he is a minor.

A friend of the Cisneros family set up a GoFundMe pay to help raise funds to help pay for Matthew’s funeral.

He was the eldest of single mom Laura Ciseros’ three children.
