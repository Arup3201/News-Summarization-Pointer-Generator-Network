Unprecedented: President Obama is taking a personal interest in Mr Heywood's death

US President Barack Obama was told of the alleged murder of British businessman Neil Heywood before foreign 
secretary William Hague.

The president was briefed about the 41-year-old's suspected poisoning within hours of Chinese police
 chief Wang Lijun walking into a US consulate to tell officials he was 
murdered.

The decision to inform the President so soon after the killing of a British citizen overseas so soon after it happened was described as 'almost unprecedented'.

John Tkacik, who worked for the US 
state department in China for 20 years told The Sunday Telegraph: 'This
 was a very high official with extraordinary intelligence.

'In all of my 
experience I can't recall its equal.'

Mr Heywood's former business partner and powerful lawyer
Gu Kailai - wife of rising Communist leader Bo Xilai - is suspected of 
ordering his murder and is under arrest.

Last night it was claimed that the couple ordered a plane to be blown out of the sky in a bid to kill a rival politician's wife.

China Northern Airlines flight 6136 
crashed into the sea by the port city of Dalian, where Bo was mayor, in May 2002.

The
 disaster killed 112 - including Li Yanfeng, wife of Han Xiaoguang, a 
wealthy hotelier and ally of Bo's political opponents.

Han was in jail at the time and Li 
was returning from Beijing with letters pleading for his release which were written by the daughters of 
Communist Party general secretary, Hu Jintao, and former president Li 
Xiannian.

Chinese journalist Jiang Weiping, who
 was being held with Han after accusing the Communist Party of 
embezzlement, told the Sunday Express details of the crash were covered 
up and the black box was never discovered.

Jiang said Han told him he believes 
Gu and Bo sabotaged the aircraft to assassinate his wife.

He added: 
'Han's wife worked as the special assistant of the human resource 
chief.

'After the crash, the officials 
released a list of fatalities. Li Yanfeng's profile was basically blank,
 listing only her name and deliberately left out her occupation and other
 information.

'If Bo was involved in the plot it 
is likely that he wanted to eliminate the threat posed by Li Yanfeng, 
as she knew too much about him.'

The official news agency Xinhua 
reported passenger Zhang Pilin - a former member of the secret police -
 set fire to the plane in a suicide attack but others have dismissed this, claiming he was a scapegoat.

It has also been claimed that Gu 
killed TV presenter Zhang Weijie who was allegedly having an affair with
 Bo and vanished after moving to Bejing.

Chinese government hackers are 
believed to be behind a crippling cyber attack on a US-based website 
that revealed how Mr Heywood was killed with 
cyanide on the orders of Gu.

The
 Boxun website, run by Chinese dissidents, first reported that Mr 
Heywood was killed in his hotel room  after agreeing to syphon almost 
£1billion out of the country for her.

The
 website said Old Harrovian Mr Heywood was killed after he asked for a 
bigger cut and threatened to expose Mrs Gu if his demands were not met.

The
 cyber attack on Boxun paralysed the website for hours on Friday, 
forcing it to find another internet hosting service to get back online.  

The
 manager of the North Carolina-based site said Boxun had become a victim
 of a ‘denial of service’ attack, with hackers bombarding it with  
millions of requests per minute, causing it to crash.

Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood 
was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but 
details of his demise are sketchy

The attack came five days after The 
Mail on Sunday reported how sensational details of the Heywood case had 
been revealed by Boxun and then  circulated on websites across China.  

Many
 of the details of the murder  first reported by Boxun have since been 
confirmed by diplomats and  officials close to the investigation.

Mr
 Heywood, was found dead in Chongqing in November. At the time, 
Chinese authorities claimed he died of alcohol poisoning, while British 
officials told his family that he had suffered a heart attack.

His body 
was cremated a day later without any post-mortem examination. Friends 
said Mr Heywood was a moderate drinker.

Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil
Heywood was found dead

Last month, Wang Lijun – the police chief of Chongqing – walked into a US consulate and claimed Mr Heywood had been poisoned.

The scandal surrounding Mr Heywood’s death led to the purge of Mr Bo as the Communist party leader of Chongqing.

Mr Bo, who was tipped to become a member of the nine-man Politburo that runs China, now faces an uncertain future. His 54-year-old wife is under arrest for ‘intentional homicide’ and faces the death penalty.

Questions: Chinese officials are investigating 
whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr 
Bo (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left)

Last week, at least 11 people were arrested across Chongqing. Officials are struggling to contain the political fallout from the scandal as China  prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership change in the autumn.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday reported that Mr Heywood was  murdered after allegedly helping Mrs Gu syphon nearly £800 million of assets overseas.

He is believed to have been poisoned with potassium cyanide by a henchman of Mr Bo.

Boxun, which promotes human rights and democracy in China, has been targeted by Chinese government hackers in the past.

News of Mr Heywood’s murder has been heavily censored in China.
