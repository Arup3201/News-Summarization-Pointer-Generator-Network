The son of a millionaire CEO was arrested for cocaine possession hours after his parents burned to death in a fire that was 'intentionally set', it has emerged.

Matthew Sheridan, 40, was detained in the early hours of September 28 when police found cocaine, digital scales, and plastic bags in his car.

His arrest came minutes after fire fighters were scrambled to a fatal fire in the five-bedroom home he shared with his parents, Cooper Health System CEO John Sheridan, 72, and his 69-year-old wife Joyce, in Skillman, New Jersey.

Authorities refrained from making the arrest public as they continue to probe the cause of the fire - but insist the cases are unrelated.

And despite obtaining illegal substances, which carry a five-year jail term in New Jersey, the Prosecutor's Office ordered a bail unit to release the defendant and refused to authorize indictable charges. 

A family representative told The Philadelphia Inquirer: 'This is a private matter for Matt. 

'It is entirely unrelated to the investigation of the death of Joyce and John Sheridan, and the family will have nothing more to say on the matter.'

Last month, the prosecutor ruled Matthew and his three brothers - Mark, Dan and Tim - had no involvement in the fire that killed their parents shortly after 6am on September 28.

The same statement confirmed they believe the fire, which was contained to the master bedroom, was 'set intentionally'. 

John Sheridan, a former state transport commissioner, and Joyce, a retired teacher, were found unconscious in the room. 

Hidden: Authorities did not make the arrest public and the prosecutor's office would not authorize charges

According to the report read by the Inquirer, Matthew Sheridan was arrested at 6.13am, in the same minute that a neighbor alerted police to the fire.

However, the Prosecutor's Office claims the arrest was made later in the afternoon as Matthew Sheridan did not return from New York until midday.

A spokesman attributed the discrepancy to human error. 

Charges were filed at 3pm but four days later authorities ordered a bail unit to 'release defendant from bail tracking' and refused to authorize indictable charges.

The case is being reviewed by the office, which has five years to table a complaint that would lead to a charge.

Rocco Cipparone Jr, a former federal prosecutor, told Philly.com that  'it's not typical [a drug charge] would be dismissed.'
