A San Diego woman accused of soliciting forcible rape and sodomy on a couple who bought her dream home pleaded not guilty in court today. 

Kathy Rowe was arraigned on felony charges that also included misdemeanor counts for identity theft and repeated harassment by electronic communication, according to ABC News.

The 52-year-old, who's free on $50,000 bail, entered the plea through her attorney, Brad Patton, and the next hearing is set for October 17.

Hell: Kathy Rowe was so furious after she missed out on purchasing the home in Carmel Valley, California, pictured, that she decided to make the new owners' lives a living hell

A Superior Court judge earlier had dismissed the sex solicitation charges because he didn't have a strong suspicion that Rowe had the specific intent to cause men to commit any kind of sexual assault on the woman who bought the house, according to the Times of San Diego.

The District Attorney's Office appealed the decision, and the 4th District Court of Appeal reinstated the charges.

Rowe, who was named 'Mother of the Year' in 2007 for the work she did for her disabled daughter, was so furious after she missed 
out on purchasing the Carmel Valley dream home, she decided to make the 
new owners' lives a living hell.

According
 to a criminal complaint, she unleashed her fury by impersonating the 
woman in a sexually-explicit online advertisement that requested 
stranger men force their way into her house and 'take me while I say 
no.'

Rowe's ad for the 'Carmel Valley Freak Show' was graphic and encouraged interested men to contact the woman for sexual favors of all kinds while her husband was at work, NBC 7 reported.

She told at least one man, who responded with a naked picture of himself, to 'just stop by any Monday-Friday 9am-3pm,' and sent him an image of the victim, which she took from a social media website.

'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at the door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' she wrote, before explaining that she loves anal sex and threesomes.

Another man responded to the notice and ended up going round to the victim's home but no one answered the door. The husband answered the door on a subsequent visit.

Prosecutors claim Rowe also harassed the couple by listing their home for sale, putting a hold on the couple's mail, sending Valentine;s Day cards from the husband to married women in the neighborhood and having members of religious groups visit the home.  

She also allegedly posted an online announcement for a high school New Year's Eve party at the victim's home and a free Mexican fireworks giveaway on Independence Day.

Rowe was charged with soliciting forcible rape and forcible sodomy, and other crimes.

However, a Superior Court judge dismissed the most serious of those charges before trial because she didn't believe Rowe actually intended for the woman to be raped.

The district attorney's office disagreed, and appealed the judge’s ruling and the Forth District Court of Appeal reinstated the criminal charges.

Rowe's lawyer Brad Patto told NBC 7 his client deeply regrets her behavior, which she initially denied. However he said the actions were nothing more than 'prankish behavior.' He added that the woman had sent written apologies to the husband and wife.
