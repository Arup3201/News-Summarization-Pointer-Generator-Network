The disturbed gunman who killed six people in California on Saturday has been hailed as a hero by an underground online forum for men unable to date women.

Elliot Rodger's massacre has thrown the depraved world of PickUp-Artist's into the spotlight - especially the rage-filled PUAHate.com, an extreme group which describes itself as the 'Anti-Pickup-Artist Movement'.

Its members are all men who have spent time and money on books and seminars designed to help them pick-up women - but who have failed and are furious with the 'scams, deception and misleading marketing techniques used by dating gurus and the seduction community.'

Anger: British-born student Elliot Rodger, 22 - son of Hunger Games film director Peter Rodger - who murdered six people in the Isla Vista district of Santa Barbara, California, because he was a virgin and girls would not have sex with him

The bitter and misogynistic tweets are full of tales of woe from men who don't know how to get women to date them and then blame the women themselves for the problem.

He posted in 2013, 'If you could release a virus that would kill every single man on Earth, except for yourself because you would have the antidote, would you do it?'

'You will be the only man left, with all the females. You would be able to have your pick of any beautiful woman you want, as well has having dealt vengeance on the men who took then from you.

'Imagine how satisfying that would be.'

Pick-up-artist: Elliot Rodger hated the idea that he had to learn to pick-up girls and despised it when these techniques went wrong

Racial: Some of Elliot Roger's posts to the pick-up-artist's web forums were aimed at minorities and their success with women compared to his

In high gear: the 22-year-old boasted about his luxury vehicles, including his black BMW involved in the drive-by shootings

His comments were lauded online by members of PUAHate.com, with some labeling him a hero.

Rodger’s posts have disappeared with the website, but on Saturday the Southern Poverty Law Center unearthed some comments, both racist and misogynistic, that he wrote on the forums. One post reads:

'I was shopping at Trader Joe’s and saw an Indian guy with 2 above average White Girls!!! What rage-inducing sights did you guys see today? Don’t you just hate seeing these things when you go out? It just makes you want to quit life.'

Indeed, Rodger, who stabbed three men to death before shooting two UCSB soroity sisters and one male freshman, before taking his own life, was very prominent online in the PUA community.

Pick-Up Artists, or PUAs', are men online who talk about their failure to secure girlfriends - and despair about forever being friends and not lovers.

Disturbed: Elliot Rodger, 22, took his own life Friday after murdering six people and leaving 13 others wounded in California

Armed to the teeth: Rodger had legally purchased two Sig Sauers like the one pictured right and a Glock 34

They are determined to date women who score at least seven out of ten on their own scale of attractiveness, and they all trade tips online about how to become the dominant men they all aspire to be.

Among their techniques to pick up women is a method called 'negging' - which essentially means, insulting women to break down their confidence.

Those on Pick-Up-Artist websites resent women for controlling the sexual market and believe that women only like men who treat them badly.

Ultimately, the PUA thinks that women are not deserving of respect and a target to conquer.

Indeed, Rodger was also a member of PUAHate.com, a forum that is not designed to attack the methods of pick-up-artist, but in fact, to point out unsuccessful techniques.

The site has been taken down in the aftermath of Rodger's killing spree, but according to Slate, the forum is designed to host those interested in 'exposing the scams, deception and misleading marketing techniques used by dating gurus and the seduction community to deceive men and profit from them.'

Chase: Rodger crashed his BMW after he was pursued by police

In YouTube videos and a long written manifesto, Elliot Rodger aired his contempt for everyone from his roommates to the whole human race, reserving special hate for two groups: the women he says kept him a virgin for all of his 22 years, and the men they chose instead.

Authorities said he put that bitterness into action in a stabbing and shooting rampage Friday night across the seaside California college town of Isla Vista that killed two young women and four men, at least half of them students at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Thirteen people were injured.

Rodger then apparently shot and killed himself inside the black BMW he used in the violence, authorities said Saturday.

The rampage played out largely as he laid it out in the public postings, including a YouTube video where he sits in the BMW in sunset light and appears to be acting out scripted lines and planned laughs.

'I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you,' Rodger, the son of a Hollywood director who worked on 'The Hunger Games,' says in the video posted Friday and taken down by YouTube on Saturday with a message saying it violated the site's terms of service.

'I don't know why you girls are so repulsed by me,' he says in the video, describing his loneliness and frustration at never having had sex with or even kissed a girl. 'I am polite. I am the ultimate gentleman. And yet, you girls never give me a chance. I don't know why.'

Deceased: Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, was shot and killed as he entered the IV Deli, in Isla Vista at 9.30pm on Friday night

Of the men he sees as rivals, he said: 'I deserve girls much more than all those slobs,' and that after his rampage 'you will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior one, the true alpha male.'

Sheriff Bill Brown, appearing on CNN on Sunday said that investigators are tying up a few ends, but 'for the most part, I think, we have a pretty clear picture of what happened '

The first three killed Friday were male stabbing victims in Rodger's own apartment whose names have not been released, Brown said Saturday.

Then, at about 9:30 p.m., the citywide shooting and vehicle-ramming rampage began.

His first stop was the Alpha Phi sorority, which he had called 'the hottest sorority of UCSB.'

'I know exactly where their house is and I've sat outside it in my car to stalk them many times,' Rodger wrote in his extensive manifesto titled 'My Twisted World.'

No one answered the door after one to two minutes of aggressive pounding, but he soon shot three women who were standing nearby, killing two of them, 19-year-old Veronika Weiss and 22-year-old Katherine Cooper.

He then drove to a deli where he walked inside and shot and killed another UC Santa Barbara student, 20-year-old Christopher Michaels-Martinez, the sheriff said.

'Chris was a really great kid,' Michaels-Martinez's father said at a news conference where he choked back tears and eventually collapsed to his knees in agony. 'Ask anyone who knew him. His death has left our family lost and broken.'
