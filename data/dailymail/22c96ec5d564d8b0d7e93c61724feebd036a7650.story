Still patron: Esther Rantzen denies rumours she will be removed as patron of a charity for victims of child abuse after claims she failed to act on Jimmy Savile allegations

Esther Rantzen has strenuously denied rumours she is facing the sack as patron of a child abuse charity after she failed to act on allegations that Jimmy Savile molested youngsters.

Ms Rantzen, a patron of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), had said earlier that some in broadcasting 'blocked their ears' to the claims against the Jill'll Fix It star 18 years ago.

Founder of NAPAC, Peter Saunders told
 The Sun today: 'In the light of her admission that she heard rumours 
about Savile but did nothing, I am going to ask the trustees if they 
feel she is an appropriate patron.'

But speaking to MailOnline today, in light of the comments made by Mr 
Saunders, Ms Rantzen said he had told her the trustees would simply 'discuss the whole subject of adult survivors' and 'there was no
 change to her position'.

She said she had received a long email 
from Mr Saunders on Friday assuring her that she would remain the 
charity's patron.

Ms Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, earlier said: 'I had a long email correspondence with the chief executive of 
NAPAC - friend and colleague - Peter Saunders and he assured me that I 
have not been removed as a patron.

'Peter Saunders has told me that the rumour that I have been removed as a patron is untrue.

'Certainly
 last night (Friday) he said he was exhausted and emotional in his email
 but was absolutely supportive of both me and ChildLine.

'At the end of the day it is their (the trustees) decision if they remove me as patron, that's for them to decide.'

The
 rumours surrounding Savile claim that he molested underage children and abused sick children in their 
hospital beds.

The Sun also claimed that Ms Rantzen's photo and details had been removed from NAPAC's website.

Ms Rantzen said today she didn't know anything about her photo being removed from the website.

She told MailOnline: ‘The only 
information I have had came from chief executive Peter Saunders, who 
said, in direct quotes, “I think probably the trustees will have to 
discuss the whole subject of adult survivors because they have been 
inundated with calls”.

‘There is no change to my position, he very kindly said “the children have got ChildLine and you, thank god”.

The claims come as a woman said she confided in Ms Rantzen about Savile, but nobody acted on her concerns, it was reported.

Shy Keenan, 49, who founded Phoenix 
Survivors, a charity that supports child sex abuse victims and their 
families, says she heard the rumours and believed she a had a 'duty' to 
raise the alarm and so told Ms Rantzen after they were introduced through a sex offender specialist.

Ms Rantzen told the MailOnline how 
she had 'absolutely no recollection' of meeting Shy Keenan, who claimed 
she spoke up about the claims against the Jim'll Fix It star 18 years 
ago.

Ms Rantzen, 72, said: 'If it's true I'm afraid I have absolutely no recollection of the conversation with her (Ms Keenan).

But she did concede that she had 
'literally had hundreds of conversations about child abuse but I'm sure I
 do not remember meeting this woman'.

She said: 'But I'm afraid that in my television life I did meet thousands of people.'

'It
 could have been after a program... It said in The Sun that Ray Wyre 
[the pioneering probation officer who worked with paedophiles] 
introduced us and I did know him very well.'

She added today: 'I find it very disappointing 
that Shy Keenan did not discuss any concerns she had with me first.'

When asked if she had any regrets 
about claims she didn’t follow up on any information from Shy, she 
said: ‘Rumours are not something you can act upon.’

Ms Rantzen had said earlier that she was 'fooled' by Jimmy Savile into 
thinking he was a saint, and berated herself for ignoring rumours that 
swirled around the star at the time.

She said: ''I felt to blame. I felt 
Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, 
even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became 
untouchable.'

Ms Keenan had told The Sun newspaper earlier: 'I was shocked by what I had heard so I thought I would tell Esther about it.'

Ms Keenan says following the conversation with Ms Rantzen, during which she suggested ideas about to help victims like herself, nothing was done.

Ms Rantzen said: 'I think it is very disappointing... I 
would've hoped she could've picked up the phone and talked to me because
 it says in The Sun that if she had any more information than that about
 the Jimmy Savile rumours I would have urged her to take it to the 
police.

'I am very disappointed about what this lady has said, I never worked with her.'

She told The Sun: 'I do not believe she ever named Jimmy Savile or any other perpetrator .'

Ms Rantzen founded ChildLine, a 24-hour confidential helpline that takes more than a million telephone calls a year providing free counselling for children to discuss abuse and neglect, in 1986.

Ms Rantzen, who presented TV show That’s Life, announced she would stand against Margaret Moran in Luton South as an ‘anti-sleaze’ candidate after allegations the MP had fiddled with Government expenses. Ms Rantzen launched her campaign in July 2009 but lost her deposit in the 2010 general election.

The fresh claims come as Scotland Yard revealed the investigation into Jimmy 
Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale to 340 separate lines
 of inquiry, Scotland Yard revealed last night.

There are now 40 potential victims and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s reign of child abuse.

A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them

It
 prompted the BBC’s Director General to issue his second grovelling 
apology of the week – and announce a total of three independent 
inquiries.

Celebrities and former BBC staff 
potentially face arrest for alleged sex offences as police hunt 
accomplices of Savile’s four decades of attacks. He is alleged to have 
raped and molested children as young as ten.

As well as the BBC, three NHS 
hospitals, a former children’s home in  Jersey and a now-defunct school 
in Surrey are accused of giving him free rein to attack children. Some 
victims have named people ‘around Savile’ as being complicit in his 
abuse.

Mr Entwistle 
revealed that police warned him last week they would pursue ‘live 
active criminal investigations’ against suspects.

The
 BBC chief's apology comes as a slew of patients from Broadmoor mental 
hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Leeds General
 Infirmary claim that the the former Top Of The Pops host abused them.

Founder: Ms Rantzen, who presented on television show That's Life, founded ChildLine in 1986

Savile boasted about 'having his own bedroom' at the mental hospital and having a set of keys to the unit.

The gold-plated set was presented to the 
predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him 
access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed.

Now the Department of Health has 
launched an inquiry into how Savile was appointed a role in overseeing 
the management of Broadmoor hospital, where he is accused of molesting 
patients in their beds.

A spokesman said: 'We will investigate the Department of Health's conduct in apparently appointing Savile to this role.

'Although
 the framework for child protection and safeguarding for Broadmoor and 
other Special Hospital patients changed radically in 1999, we of course 
want to establish the circumstances and see if any lessons can be 
learned.

The Department of Health will launch an inquiry into how Savile came to be appointed to Broadmoor's taskforce

'In hindsight he should very obviously not have been appointed.

'Had anyone involved in the appointment been aware of allegations of abuse against Savile, we would not have expected him to have been appointed.'

The spokesman stressed that they were not investigating individuals' claims that the presenter sexually abused them.

Ms Rantzen said that since the allegations against Savile have come to light, more people have called Childline to speak about their own child abuse experiences.

She said: When the documentary came out I received lots of calls from people saying how can you say such things about a great man?

'Now lots more people are talking about their own experiences of child abuse in general.'
