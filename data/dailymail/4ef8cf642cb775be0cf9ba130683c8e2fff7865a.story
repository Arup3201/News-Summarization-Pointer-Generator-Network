Footballers are normally sent off the pitch for foul play, but on this occasion it was a manager who was throwing a strop.

Victoria Coulton, 12, was ordered to leave the pitch when playing for Prestatyn Athletic Rangers after the manager of the opposing team claimed she was too old to be playing in a team with boys .

Her local Rhyl and District League, in North Wales, says girls can play in all league competitions until the age of 15.

12-year-old Victoria Coulton was ordered off the pitch after kick off because she was too old to play alongside boys

But the Welsh FA says girls can no longer play in mixed teams beyond 12.

Victoria started the match, but it was halted shortly after kick-off, and she had to be substituted.

Prestatyn High School pupil Victoria lined up to take part in a Rhyl and District cup semi final with Trefnant on March 30 - but before the game kicked off, the opposing manager flagged up whether or not she should be playing.

Despite the Trefnant coach's concern, Victoria's dad Nigel said the referee allowed her to play.

‘Five minutes into the game the female Trefnant coach asked the ref to stop the game and had a mobile in her hand with a member of the Rhyl and District League on the other end,’ added Mr Coulton.

Victoria Coulton has been named man of the match five times this season

‘Whoever was on the phone instructed Prestatyn to remove Victoria as she was ineligible.

‘I cannot begin to imagine how humiliating that must have been for her.’

The constitutional rules on the l Rhyl and District League website states: 'The league will allow teams to register girls in order to participate in all league competitions, under eight to under 15 age groups'.

Her parents Nigel and Lindsay Coulton say they were shocked at the move.

Mr Coulton, said: ‘If you are eligible to start a season then you should be able to finish it.

‘At the start of the season Victoria was give permission by her club and the league to play this season.

‘On March 26, Victoria turned 12 but the Rhyl and District rules state that anyone under 12, before August 31 is eligible to compete in the under-12s for that season.’

Mr Coulton said he and his wife are both devastated for Victoria, who wants to continue playing in a mixed team because there is more competition.

They both said they are also fighting the decision, not only for Victoria, but for their other daughter, nine-year-old, Elizabeth, who was voted Prestatyn Town FC academy player of the year.

Wrexham fan Victoria has picked up five man of the matches this season, and said that one day she hopes to play for her country.
