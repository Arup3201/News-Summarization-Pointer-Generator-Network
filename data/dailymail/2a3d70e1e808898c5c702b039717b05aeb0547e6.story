Miami Dolphins center Mike Pouncey was served with a grand jury subpoena by Massachusetts State Police less than an hour after the Patriots defeated the Dolphins 27-17 at Gillette Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

The subpoena relates to the continuing investigation into Aaron Hernandez, who was indicted in the June killing of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player.

Pouncey is a close friend of Hernandez and the pair are former teammates at the University of Florida.

Hernandez is currently being held without bail after he pleaded not guilty to six charges in September, including first-degree murder and five weapons-related charges.

Police are currently investigating Hernandez's possible involvement in interstate gun trafficking, reports SI.com.

The increased scrutiny on Hernandez's gun activity could be an indication that the gun charges have taken an increased importance in the ongoing investigation.

Pouncey's potential involvement is as yet undetermined, but police are focusing on multiple transactions that involve him and Hernandez.

A grand jury subpoena does not mean Pouncey, 24, will be charged with a crime, but rather he is regarded by law enforcement officials as a material witness who could advance their case against Hernandez.

After Sunday's game, two members of 
the Massachusetts State Police in dark suits approached Pouncey in the 
hallway between the Dolphins locker room and the team bus and handed him
a piece of white paper.

'It's about a grand jury 
investigation,' one official told Pouncey, reports SI.com. The same 
police official later said, 'Make sure you arrive.'

Pouncey and his twin brother, 
Maurkice, a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, lived together with 
Hernandez when they played at Florida. The brothers were credited with keeping Hernandez out of trouble during their time playing together.Â
