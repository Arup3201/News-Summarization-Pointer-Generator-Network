When Nikki Scott lost her husband and the father of her two oldest children, Corporal Lee Scott, during a tour to Afghanistan in July 2009  she thought she would never experience happiness again.

But five years on, Nikki is remarried to military man Joe Howlin, who served in Afghanistan alongside her late husband, and she gave  birth to their first baby together just 12 days ago.

Speaking on ITV's Lorraine ahead of the  documentary Young War Widows, which airs tonight, the 33-year-old described her mixed emotions at her new-found happiness: 'It’s hard because I sometimes feel guilty – I love two men. Sometimes my head gets a bit messed up.

She added: 'But  I know I’m lucky. I have two amazing husbands. It's good to finally be in good place.'

Nikki told Lorraine Kelly that despite finding love again her late husband is always in her thoughts: 'I keep Lee’s memory alive every day. 

'My children say, "I have one daddy in heaven looking down on us and Jo at home doing all the daddy things".' 

'Joe was out in Afghanistan with Lee. I didn’t know Joe then, but Lee did so Joe can tell the kids what it was like.' 

In a clip from tonight's documentary the war widow was seen fighting back tears as she paid tribute to her late husband.

She said: 'He’d just turned 26 and was full of life. He loved his family. He loved the Army but he loved his kids.' 

Remembering the last time she spoke to her husband over five years ago, the mother-of three said: 'He was saying, "I love you, I miss you" and it was all about, "When I get back think about what do you want to do". It was all, "What have you been doing?". 

'He also did say, "This is the worst tour I've ever done. This is like nothing I've ever done before. I'm signing off when I come back. It’s not worth it."

'For Lee to tell me that I knew it was bad because he usually would not have told me anything.'

Five days later, Nikki was greeted by Army officials as she returned from a walk with a friend. 

'I saw two cars outside the house and I was crying walking down the street. I knew those cars were for me. I thought, "Lee’s been hurt."'

Sadly she was informed of graver news. Her husband had been killed in a roadside explosion.

Nikki said that despite finding love again her late husband is always in her thoughts

'I thought my life was over,' she said and says the hardest part was breaking the news to her son, Kai, who was five at the time. At seven months old, her daughter Brooke was too young to understand.

'I  had to be straight and clear so I didn't get his hopes up,' she said. 'But it's devastating to see your kids cry. You hug them but you can't make it better.'

'I think that was the hardest part - to tell Kai.'  

Her daughter Brooke, now six, sleeps with a picture of the beloved father she never knew under her pillow.

The 33-year-old described her mixed emotions at her new-found happiness: 'It’s hard because I sometimes feel guilty – I love two men'

'She is very emotional that she can't remember her daddy,' Nikki explained.

Choking back tears the mother remembered: 'In the evening when the kids were in bed was the worst because then I had time to think.

'I never thought I'd turn that corner,' she said.

It was only when she took Kai on holiday in the aftermath of the tragedy and saw him laugh again that she realised how badly he'd been affected - and felt motivated to live life again for the sake of her children's happiness.

'That's when we set up Scotty's Little Soldiers, which supports kids who have lost a parent in the British armed forces.

'We are now supporting 200 children - and keeping Lee’s memory alive.'  

Young War Widows airs tonight at 9pm on ITV 

In a tribute to her late husband Nikki said: 'He’d just turned 26 and was full of life. He loved his family. He loved the army but he loved his kids.'
