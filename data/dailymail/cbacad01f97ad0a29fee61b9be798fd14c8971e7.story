Girlfriend Claire Oakford has been supporting Mr Pollard since the shark attack almost two months ago

Mr Pollard's family launched an appeal to help fund the 23-year-old's long road to recovery. 

A Facebook page was set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Mr Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation.

The social media page has been frequently updated with Mr Pollard's condition - the most recent being the photo of him with his girlfriend and reporting that he's going back home to Bunbury, south of Perth.

Funds will also be raised for The Sean Pollard Appeal at a silent auction and trivia night this Saturday night in Launceston, Tasmania.

Items up for auction include wetsuits and framed images of surfers catching a wave.

Sean Pollard's family have launched an appeal for his long road to recovery

Department of Fisheries examinations have revealed that the bite marks on Sean Pollard's surfboard would indicate a Great White shark was responsible for the attack 

A facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay on WA's south coast on Thursday

Mr Pollard's appeal was established soon after WA fisheries revealed bite marks on the 23-year-old's surfboard, indicating a Great White shark was responsible for his injuries.

The two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to Perth for examination by the department's experts.

Department of Fisheries' principal shark scientist Dr. Rory McAuley said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident. 

He said while results were inconclusive, it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught. 

'We have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on Thursday [the day of the attack] and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received,' he said.

Surfer Sean Pollard lost parts of both arms in the attack near Esperance, Western Australia on Thursday

Sean Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday which is believed to have been caused by a Great White shark

Examinations by Fisheries scientists have revealed that the bite on Sean's surfboard was caused by a Great White shark 

'Jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations. The first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length.'

'Our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae, which will assist us with our research work.'

'Now that our investigation is complete, material will be made available to other research institutions,' said Dr. McAuley.

WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety.

'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said.  

'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' 

It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials.

Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible.

Beaches in the Wylie Bay area have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident.
