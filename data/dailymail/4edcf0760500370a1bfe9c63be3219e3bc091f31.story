An unemployed father-of-12 branded 'Britain’s most badly behaved dad' was condemned by a judge today for setting a bad example to his children and making the 'lives of others miserable'.

Stuart Murgatroyd, 41, was handed an Asbo to prevent him from harassing his neighbours, after a previous order banning his bad conduct expired.

He was  previously arrested on suspicion of assault against the mother of his children last month - just 20 minutes before he was due to appear in court to contest his second anti social behaviour order.

The hearing, where Murgatroyd was to 'vehemently deny' terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs, was later adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed JPs that Murgatroyd was in police cells.

In their blood: Murgatroyd with children Demi, 15, Chloe, 14 and Reece, 13, who have all been given Asbos

But today as he was finally banned him from being drunk in public, he made a plea from the dock, insisting: 'I shouldn't really be getting an Asbo'. He is the fifth member of his family to have been given an Asbo.

At Burnley Magistrates' Court, Murgatroyd was issued with a two-year anti social behaviour order.

The
Asbo bans him from using abusive and threatening language in public, 
making obscene hand gestures and being drunk or in the possession of any
open container of alcohol.

Drunken Murgatroyd, who has never worked, has a long criminal record for robbing elderly people and once had to be sprayed with CS gas by police in a row over his son’s football.

Council officials had kicked the family out of one of their previous homes in Burnley, Lancashire, after 125 complaints from neighbours who had endured three years of loud parties, fighting and drunken behaviour.

His twin boys Reece and Dillon, aged 13, already have two-year Asbos ordering them not to cause 'harassment, alarm or distress'.

Police secured interim Asbos against their big sisters Chloe and Demi, aged 14 and 15 - but both were dropped after there were no further reports against them of bad behaviour.

Last month Murgatroyd tried to make a legal challenge against the application to issue him with the Asbo.

But he failed when he was arrested outside the courthouse for tipping a carton of Ribena juice over his long-suffering partner.

He claimed his predominantly Muslim neighbourhood singled him out and reported him to police because they disapproved of his heavy drinking.

But District Judge Mr Peter Ward warned he faced jail if he stepped out of line again and retorted: 'I don’t think it is a clash of cultures, I think the problem is him being drunk.

'If he is involved in disorderly behaviour that does not set a good example to the children and looking through the papers that’s what has been going on and clearly making the lives of others miserable.

'This is a dreadful category of anti-social behaviour, being drunk outside, shouting abuse and general disturbance to others makes their lives miserable.

'If you breach this order, the maximum sentence is of five years in prison.

'If there is a repeat of this sort of behaviour and you are on breach I will be looking at the sentencing guidelines for persistent breach of the Asbo.

'Do not assume that if you breach it you will only be getting a fine of £50.'

The Asbo will apply in the Burnley area but will not stretch to his new address in Nelson where he and his family moved for a 'fresh start'.

Murgatroyd has never worked, claiming sickness benefit for depression since he was 17.

'Britain's worst-behaved dad' has been jailed previously for mugging pensioners and stealing in a cemetery

In April 1999 he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for mugging three pensioners and stealing a handbag from a woman of 78 in a cemetery.

Partner Dawn Hughes, who left their children with a babysitter so she could act as his getaway driver, was jailed for a year.

In August 2004 he suffered head injuries when he was attacked by a neighbour armed with a 2ft-long machete amid claims a text message had been sent threatening to firebomb the home of the attacker’s mother.

Then in 2007 Murgatroyd sparked a police siege after a row over a neighbour confiscating his children’s football.

He was said to have lost his temper and hurled cutlery and a vacuum cleaner towards officers before being overpowered with CS gas.

Murgatroyd had previously been issued with an Asbo but after it expired last November the couple and eight of their children moved into a £150-a-week rented three-bedroomed terrace house in Nelson hoping to make a 'fresh start'.

But he was arrested again and given an interim Asbo earlier this year.

Representing Burnley Council, Mr Jonathan Jackson said: 'He has shown low-level, persistent anti-social behaviour which makes life a misery for other people.

'It is his drunk and disorderly behaviour that is a problem, but not necessarily targeting specific people.

'Perhaps some of it stemming from a family of 13, this happened largely in the Burnley borough.'

In mitigation, defence solicitor Mr Mark Williams said: 'On July 1st the family moved to Nelson and it has been a good three months without any issues.

'There were problems which grew over a period of time in Burnley, to a degree there was a clash of cultures.

'He had a large family living in a predominantly Pakistani area and he would drink and that would be frowned upon in the community.

'Mr Murgatroyd was more the victim. There was a confrontation with a group of males with baseball bats, maybe they are more at fault.

'There have been other incidents where drink has been involved. He wasn’t well liked in the area. They wanted to move and wanted a fresh start, it has been a fresh start. There has not been any problem in Nelson and he said he wishes never to go back to Burnley.

'There is always going to be a bit of noise when there are eight children living there.

'They have been brought up properly and their behaviour has always been good - to question him as a father is not right.'
