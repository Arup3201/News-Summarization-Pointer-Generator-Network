Everton team-mates Ross Barkley and Phil Jagielka have gone up against each other in a video where they compete in a crossbar challenge.

The duo take it in turns to try and knock a bottle of beer off the crossbar of a goal frame from the halfway line - and one of them shows he has the technique to do it first time!

Barkley and Jagielka have both had a very successful 
campaign on Merseyside, making a combined 60 Premier League appearances 
and helping the club to their record Premier League haul of 72 points.

Young Barkley, meanwhile, is not expected to start for the Three Lions, but will be hoping to get the opportunities somewhere along the line to make really make a mark.

England start the tournament against Italy on June 14, before facing Uruguay and Costa Rica in their remaining Group D fixtures.
