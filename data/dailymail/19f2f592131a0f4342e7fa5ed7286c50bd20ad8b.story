A mother was told her baby son was stillborn, only to discover him alive wrapped in a yellow plastic bag and dumped in a hospital bathroom.

Four medics have been suspended after the incident Nanhai Red Cross Hospital in Foshan, China, where nurses also told the mother wrongly the child was a girl.

It is yet another scandal to hit the city in Guangdong province where just a month ago a toddler died after being run over twice while being ignored by passers-by, sparking global outrage and raising questions over the country's humility.

Rescued: The little boy, who has yet to be named, is recovering well after his ordeal

China Daily reported mother Liu Dongmei, 23, was seven months pregnant when 
she arrived at the hospital with her 24-year-old 
husband, Wang Haizhang with internal bleeding and stomach cramps.

After her delivery midwives broke the devastating news the child was not crying, or breathing and had turned purple.

They then wrapped the child, which they mistakenly told Liu was a girl, in a yellow plastic bag and placed the baby in nearby bathroom, without informing a doctor.

'I just saw the bag moving up and down': The child was discovered dumped, presumed dead in the hospital bathroom

It was only 30 minutes later when Liu's sister-in-law Wang
Heping arrived and asked to see the body, did the family realised the hospital's dreadful mistake. 

Wang told China Daily said:
'I opened the plastic bag and saw the baby's hands and feet moving, the
stomach was going up and down and air bubbles were coming out of his 
mouth,'

She added she was also shocked to discover the baby was a little boy and not a girl as hospital staff had told them.

According
to local newspaper reports, nurses at the hospital are believed to have
told the family the baby was a girl in an effort to 'soften the blow'.

Hao Hu, a senior pediatrician at No 6
Hospital Affiliated to Sun Yat-sen University, questioned why medics 
did not check the baby's pulse or eyes before putting him in a bathroom.

'Even if a newborn infant is not breathing, medics should spend 15 to 30
minutes attempting to resuscitate it before certifying it as being 
dead,' he told China Daily.

In October the world was shocked after baby Yue Yue was run over twice as more than a dozen people walk past the stricken girl.

Ignored: Yue Yue was left with horrific brain injuries and never recovered after the crash in Foshan

Unaware: Video footageof the incident shocked the world, here is Yue Yue crossing the road in Guangfo 
Hardware Market, without realising the van approaching her

The incident was caught on CCTV and stunned millions in China, with many saying their society – which has 
enjoyed 30 years of rapid development – is rotten and immoral.

Yue Yue was only moved from the road when Chen Xianmei, a street scavenger, stumbles across her.

The case became a political issue and it is feared Communist Party officials have called for tighter controls over the reporting about the incident for fear of a public backlash.
