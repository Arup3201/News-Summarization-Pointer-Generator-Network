Arsenal are watching with interest as Alessio Cerci has again been left out of Torino’s squad, this time to face Inter Milan.

Arsenal have enquired about the Italy international but the stronger interest is coming from Atletico Madrid.

Arsenal have been contacted again by Sporting Lisbon about a deal for William Carvalho and that may prove timely after Roma made Adrien Rabiot of Paris St Germain a tempting offer on Friday. Wenger is a big fan of Rabiot who is 19 and provides cover for various midfield positions.

Carvalho has been pushed to Manchester United also but they do not wish to pursue a deal for a player they believe is overpriced. 

Sporting are willing to accept around £24m and would like a player on loan. The complication is third-party ownership and as Manchester United have found out that can delay proceedings. Not ideal with 48 hours to go.

Benfica holding out for Campbell loan deal

Benfica, meanwhile, are holding out hope that Arsenal will allow Joel Campbell out on loan or even sell but that is extremely unlikely.

Wenger has stipulated several times he wants the player to stay and may consider a late loan only if successful in signing a striker.

Manchester City not interested in Falcao

Manchester City say they are not in for Radamel Falcao despite the increasing fervour.

City would have done a deal for the Colombia international a year ago but his injury and the division it would create in their squad means they are to abstain this time around.

Monaco will listen to offers of a season loan for £12million or a permanent deal for £50million.

Real Madrid have been widely expected to make the deal happen - that was certainly Liverpool’s understanding when they made enquiries earlier this month and the same was relayed to Arsenal last week.

Juventus and Arsenal have not ruled themselves out of Falcao but at the moment a deal is too rich.

Juventus have also made an offer for Manchester United’s Javier Hernandez of a £1.5m loan with view to a permanent £12m deal and Valencia are keen on a similar price.

Real Madrid tempted by Alvaro Negredo 

Real Madrid however are now looking more closely at a deal for Alvaro Negredo at City.

City have yet to decide whether he will be part of their Champions League squad and will listen to offers of around £25m. That is giving Falcao’s representatives reason to believe though that City could yet come back into play for Falcao.

Negredo has a broken metatarsal and will be out until September but City are in no rush to deal unless a bid hits the mark. Valencia have an interest also but would struggle to pay the £25m.

QPR line up Sigthorsson to replace Remy

Harry Redknapp will now look to Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson as a replacement for Loic Remy who has completed a £8.5 million move to Chelsea.

Armand Traore has been left out of QPR’s team as he discusses a move to Crystal Palace.

At least Redknapp can look forward to the signing of Lassana Diarra. The former Portsmouth midfielder has had a medical and is expected to sign tomorrow once he gains international clearance.

Kagawa set for warm welcome at Dortmund

Borussia Dortmund midfielder Sebastian Kehl says Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa will be welcomed back to the German club with open arms.

Yet Kehl has warned that the Japan international Kagawa who is returning to the Westphalians for £6.3m will not be the player they remember.

The former Dortmund captain said: ‘Of course we’ve heard the latest speculation - we don’t live on the moon - but we were focusing on the game (against Augsburg).

‘Shinji was a very important factor in our side’s successes in 2011 and 2012. He delivered some fantastic performances in Dortmund, but unfortunately he’s not had such an easy time in Manchester.

‘He’s not been playing much and in particular his self-confidence is not going to be bubbling.

‘If he were to join us, then he would need to be built back up again, and he would find the surroundings here where he would be welcomed wholeheartedly, both from the fans and from the team.

‘He would get all the support he would need to be able to deliver his best performances again.’

Centre-back Virgil Van Dijk has made it clear he wants to leave and Celtic will expect bids over the weekend.

Leeds agree Adryan sale to Cagliari 

LEEDS have an agreement in place with Cagliari for Brazilian playmaker Adryan. The move was agreed last night and should be formally announced during Saturday’s game with Bolton. Leeds are still working on a deal for Paraguay striker Brian Montenegro.

One deal that Leeds are also hoping to push is for their next manager. Although Rolando Maran is the early favourite, Sportsmail understands that Swindon boss Mark Cooper is also a name in the frame.

Malouda eyes Premier League return 

Florent Malouda is looking for a return to England. The ex-Chelsea midfielder has terminated his agreement with Trabzonspor and believes he is fit to return to the Premier League despite being 34. He is now a free agent.

Another Frenchman  Morgan Amalfitano looks like being left on the shelf despite initial interest .

Amalfitano has fallen out with Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa and will be allowed to leave on a free but despite Crystal Palace, Hull and West Ham showing an initial interest the move has not materialised.

Inter enquire about Borini loan 

Sunderland, Everton and Marseille are among clubs asking about Porto defender Rolando. The powerful centre-back was on loan at Inter Milan last season and they are also interested in another loan deal. 

Inter have also asked about taking Liverpool striker Fabio Borini on loan which would ruin any hopes chance Sunderland hold of signing him before Monday.

Brentford left waiting on Forshaw 

Brentford have concerns that a fee has yet to be finalised with Wigan for midfielder Adam Forshaw. It is understood the midfielder left the club on Monday and has not been back to the training ground as he expected his move to be finalised after the clubs seemingly reached an agreement. 

However, they have yet to confirm a £4million deal. Brentford will pay £2m of that to Everton as part of a 50percent sell-on agreement.

Manager Mark Warburton said midweek: ‘As far as I know Forshaw has gone, but anyone who thinks we’ve let the League One player of the year and the talent of Adam Forshaw go for £2-3million is on a different planet to me. The club stuck by their valuation, and the owner is happy.’
