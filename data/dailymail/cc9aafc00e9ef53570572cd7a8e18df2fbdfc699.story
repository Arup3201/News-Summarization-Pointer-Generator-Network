A photo with the First Lady doesn't come cheap during campaign season.

President Barack Obama's fundraising tour will land in Chicago on Tuesday, where Michelle Obama will reportedly pose for group photos for the cost of $10,000 each.

The sum is said to benefit her husband's bid for re-election and the Democratic National Committee.

According to the Chicago Tribune, 
invitations to the event say tickets to a 'family photo reception' are 
available for the five-figure sum - with a maximum of six guests in the 
photo.

The asking price solicited by 
Generation44, the 'official under-40 fundraising program of Obama for 
America comprised of the next generation of leaders, young 
entrepreneurs, social innovators and activists', according to the 
report.

For those with a smaller budget, 
limited availability seats start at $100 at the event, which will begin 
at 5pm at the Journeymen Plumbers union hall in Near West Side.

Mrs Obama will be in Chicago to team 
up with Mayor Rahm Emanuel at a 'food desert' summit about making 
nutritious foods more accessible to Chicago communities.

The fundraiser will follow another on
Tuesday evening at a Detroit hotel, where asking prices on the 
invitation are $250, $2,500 and $10,000, according to the Tribune.

Another fundraising event in her 
native Chicago on Thursday, where billionaire Warren Buffet is expected 
to attend a dinner party on behalf of the campaign at the home of Byron 
and Tina Trott in Winnetka - where dinner is $35,000 per couple, 
according to a campaign email to top fundraisers.

The President and First Lady are not expected to attend that event.

Meanwhile, President Obama worked 
crowds in North Carolina as the First Lady put the finishing touches on a
renovated home for a medic wounded in Afghanistan in another campaign 
push of her own on Monday.

Washington D.C. resident Army Sgt 
Johnny Agbi suffered brain and spinal cord injuries and uses a 
wheelchair, but can walk short distances with the aid of a cane.

Michelle
Obama and Jill Biden visited his three-story rowhouse just blocks from 
the U.S. Capitol to paint the living room, a task helped by Mrs Obama's 
5'11 reach that meant she didn't even need a ladder.

The home underwent a $100,000 renovation under a program called Heroes at Home.

He's the 1,000th veteran whose home 
was renovated since the program began in 2007. Agbi says the changes 
have made a big difference in his life.

The First and Second Lady are 
also scheduled to attend the World Series opener in St Louis on 
Wednesday night to honour military veterans.

Major
League Baseball announced on Monday that it has dedicated Game 1 
between the Texas Rangers and St Louis Cardinals to veterans and their 
families.

The First Lady and Dr Biden, the wife
of Vice President Joe Biden, will participate in a pregame ceremony at 
Busch Stadium as part of the Welcome Back Veterans program and Obama's 
Joining Forces initiative.

Before
the game, the two will join representatives from MLB and the St Louis 
Cardinals, including Hall of Famer and Army veteran Red Schoendienst, at
the St Louis VA Medical Center for a military family appreciation 
event.

Mr Obama and Mr 
Biden also will participate in an interview on their Joining Forces 
initiative and answer questions submitted by fans through Facebook and 
Twitter.

'We are honored to have First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr Jill Biden join us for the 2011 Fall Classic to recognize the courageous men and women who serve the country as well as their families,' Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement.

'Major League Baseball has raised more than $11million over the past several years through our Welcome Back Veterans program to help support veterans and their families.

'The World Series gives us the perfect opportunity to build on this ongoing commitment.'
