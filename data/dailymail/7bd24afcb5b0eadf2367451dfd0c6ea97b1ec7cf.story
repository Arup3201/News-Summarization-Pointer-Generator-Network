Danish side Brondby have confirmed they are in talks with Liverpool about bringing defender Daniel Agger back to the club where he started his career in a £3m deal.

Brendan Rodgers has sidelined the Danish international, who hasn't featured for Liverpool thus far this season following the arrival of Dejan Lovren from Southampton this summer.

'Brondby IF can confirm that there is dialogue with Liverpool FC and Daniel Agger about a move to Brondby IF,' the club said in a statement on Saturday.

Key man: Agger has been an important defender for Liverpool in the past but is no longer first choice

Agger signed for Liverpool from Brondby 
in 2006 and looks close to be sealing a return home having made 212 
appearances for the Merseyside club.

The centre-back has been linked with a move away from Liverpool all summer to La Liga giants Barcelona and Atletico Madrid however Brondby now appear to be the front runners for his signature. 

Regarding his future, Agger recently said: 'The future is complicated. There are a few things that have to be sorted and we have to take it from there.

'I actually don’t know what will happen. It is a bit up to Liverpool. I have had niggling injuries at the wrong times and I have to say that it is difficult to change the team when it is winning. 

'I am not frustrated by that. I am frustrated the way it happened and the way it was handled.'
