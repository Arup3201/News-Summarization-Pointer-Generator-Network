A list of this year’s top YouTube videos in the UK has been topped by a comedy skit about how animals eat their food, and also contains entries from Olympic diving hero Tom Daley and Peppa pig.

How Animals Eat Their Food involved two men doing amusing demonstrations of how creatures such as a rhino, a lizard and a kangaroo eat.

The video has been viewed more than 88 million times worldwide and spawned various parodies and follow-ups.

HERE IS THE FULL LIST :

1. How Animals Eat Their Food - MisterEpicMann

2. My Wedding Speech - Tom Fletcher from McFly

3. Attraction perform their stunning shadow act - week 1 auditions, Britain’s Got Talent 2013

4. Will & Jaden Smith, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Alfonso Ribeiro Rap! - The Graham Norton Show, BBC One

Tom Fletcher from McFly posted his 
wedding speech online, which he delivered in the form of a song to his 
new bride. That finished up second in the list with 11 million views globally.

In third is a shadow act performance by group Attraction, who won Britain’s Got Talent.

Tom
Daley’s video, Something I want to say, where he explained he was in a 
relationship with a man, only appeared online in early December but 
still made it to number seven in the list with 9.8 million views.

That just beat Peppa Pig's take on the alphabet, which has been watched by millions of children.

This
year YouTube said it did not just look at views, but also took the number of shares, 
searches, likes and responses into account when it made the list.

Kevin
Allocca, head of culture and trends at YouTube, said: 'As 2013 comes to
a close, these are some of the videos, channels and moments that shaped
our year.

'While each 
annual list is unpredictable, trending videos just get bigger each year.
And with 80 per cent of all views on YouTube coming from outside the US, the 
global community is driving pop culture unlike ever before.'
