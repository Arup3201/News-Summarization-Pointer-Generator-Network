Officers were later seen peering into a storm drain at the foot of the driveway. Police also took a woman from the house.

The gunman also stole prescription painkillers Sunday from Haven Drugs in Medford.

Today's dramatic events emerged as more details of the victims of the tragic massacre continued to emerge.

One of those shot was due to get married in only four months and will be buried in her wedding dress it emerged yesterday.

The mother of brutally slaughtered bride-to-be Jaime Taccetta, 33, was keeping the white gown at her house until the wedding in October and has vowed that her daughter’s murderer will be found.

Pat
Taccetta, 52, sobbed as she declared ‘justice will be done’ following 
the horrific cold-blood killing of her ‘happy’ daughter and three others
in Medford on Long Island, New York, on Sunday morning.

Her emotional comments came as police
said they are still searching for the suspect caught on CCTV tape and 
consider him an ‘armed and dangerous’ drug user.

‘He was so senseless,’ Mrs Taccetta 
told the New York Daily News. ‘He could have stolen the drugs and left 
everybody alone. There was no reason to shoot them. He took away four 
lives.

'We’re going to get you. Justice will be done.'

Mrs Taccetta’s daughter will be 
buried this Saturday at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Coram.

Her family broke news of the death to her when she arrived home from a 
holiday in Jamaica.

Meanwhile, Miss Taccetta's fiancé has spoken of how he discovered his 
girlfriend's corpse.

James Manzella went to check on 'the love of his life' Miss Taccetta, after dropping her off at Haven Drugs in Long Island.

Incredibly,
Mr Manzella only went to check on Jamie after seeing the bearded killer
leave the pharmacy and calmly walk away from the scene.

Speaking to the New York Post, Mr 
Manzella said: 'I saw the guy walk out, and I thought something was weird.

'So I turned the car off to check on her [Jamie]. I walked to the front.'

He then stumbled upon the horrific scenes inside the store, finding Jamie as well as a second victim Bryon Sheffield, 71, dead.

'Can you imagine sitting there in air conditioning, 
listening to music, and then the next minute she's gone,' he said.

'It was horrible, man. It was something I'll never forget. I'll never forget what I saw. It's stuck in me.'

Mr Manzella, an electrician, planned to marry physical therapist Miss Taccetta in October. She had two daughters - Miranda, 16, and Kaitlyn, 5.

A distraught Mr Manzella said he was haunted by the fact he saw the killer moments after the shooting took place.

He added: 'I could see the guy clearly, and now I think back if I could have done something.

'That's what messes with you. We were two average people trying to do the right thing, and this is what happens. It's not fair.'

It has also emerged that the ruthless 
gunman was 
hunting for prescription painkillers.

In what is thought be the latest in a string of drug fuelled robberies, the killer stormed the family-owned Haven Drugs pharmacy looking for the painkillers, according to police.

A massive manhunt for the killer is continuing after Suffolk County homicide 
detectives found the bodies at about 
60 miles east of New York City.

Shot dead: Jennifer Mejia, who worked at the pharmacy in Medford, Long Island

Shock: The owner of a Pharmacy in Medford, NY collapses when he arrives at the store, following a shooting that killed four people.

A pharmacist, a teenage worker, and two customers were killed when the gunman opened fire inside the store at roughly 10am.

CCTV footage shows the gunman shooting at close range, before filling his backpack with prescription painkillers.

The killing comes as DEA agents have been calling on Long Island pharmacists to boost security after recording a 125 per cent increase in pharmacy hold-ups in 2009 and 2010.

Addicts and dealers are so desperate to get their hands on the painkillers they often leave money behind during the raids as they hunt for more drugs.

A teenage girl, just days from graduating high school, has been identified as 17-year-old Jennifer Mejia, a senior at Bellport High School in 
Brookhaven.

Her father, Rene Mejia - an immigrant from El Salvador - described her as a 'wonderful daughter'.

She had worked
at the pharmacy for about two years and wished him a happy Father's Day
early Sunday morning as she left for work.

Speaking to the New York Post Rene said: 'This morning she told me, 'Happy Father's Day.'

'She was in a hurry to go to work.

'I held her and said, 'It's okay,' because in my country, Father's Day is Friday. I feel better because I held her.'

Other victims were reported to be Raymond Ferguson, 45 - who also worked at the store - 
as well as customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, a grandfather.

Rene,
speaking outside their home, said his daughter was looking forward to 
her prom on Wednesday. 'Now I just see the dress inside,' he said.

'You have to remember all of the good things.'

His other daughter Leslie, was also supposed to work at the store that day.

'They were supposed to work today, her and my younger daughter. Leslie didn't go to work today,' he said.

The 30-year-old drugstore had been robbed before, according to Mr Mejia.

He added that despite this, his daughter was not afraid.

Speaking to the Post, he added: 'She said people would come in and demand prescription medicine sometimes. People wanted the strong stuff.

'This was a heavy-duty pharmacy, not like Duane Reade.'

Kimberly Jimenez, 18, a friend and classmate, said Miss Mejia's 'ambition was to help people.'

'She was never a troubled person. For this to happen, it's so random. Crazy - crazy.'

Shaken 
residents converged on the crime scene and described the pharmacy as a 
mom-and-pop shop where employees knew people by name.

'They know you, they know who you are,' said Nicole Kaiser, 27. 'This isn't that type of town. I can't believe it.'

A special Facebook page set up to remember the slain high school student was flooded with tributes.

Jalissa Ware posted: 'R.I.P Jenn ♥ we love youu and miss youu. I swear it feels like yesterdayy you were yellin my name in class, or we wud both compare our failing grades in math :/'

Another, Marz Idgaf, wrote: 'My little cousin is now in a better place and thats what keeps me going i love you so much jenn all we have is memories and i deff. had some good ones with you.'

Police said they were looking for a lone shooter wearing a baseball cap and backpack who was seen leaving the scene.

Suffolk County Chief of Detectives Dominick Varrone said: 'This is a vicious, horrible crime. We are dedicating a great number of resources. Right now, our primary interest is apprehending the individual or individuals involved.'

Investigators took a laptop from the drugstore and are searching for surveillance footage that may have captured the suspect.

The pharmacy’s owner appeared in the store after the incident and passed out before being loaded into an ambulance.
