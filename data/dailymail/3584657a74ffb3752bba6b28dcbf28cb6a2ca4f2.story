The only Test then takes place at captain Charlotte Edwards' home ground of Canterbury from August 11-14 before three T20s at Chelmsford (August 26), Hove (August 28) and Cardiff (August 31).

A limited-overs victory will earn two points while a Test win will be worth four, down from six in the previous series. One point apiece will be awarded for an ODI draw while two points each will be handed out for a drawn Test. Twenty20 contests will go to a super over.
