Sarah Palin has come out in defense of her daughter Bristol who allegedly punched a man in the face during a family brawl.

The former Vice President candidate hailed her child as a 'straight shooter' in a Facebook which appears to be her first veiled reference to the fight two weekends ago. 

The 23-year-old is said to have repeatedly hit the owner of a home in Anchorage, Alaska, during an outburst in which her brother Track broke four ribs and her father Todd was left with a bloody nose.

It came after Willow Palin's ex-boyfriend allegedly engage in some unspecified 'questionable behaviour'. 

Writing on Thursday, Sarah Palin said: 'I love my Bristol! My straight-shooter is one of the strongest young women you'll ever meet. 

'I have to say this as a proud mama: right up there with their work ethic and heart for those less fortunate, my kids' defense of family makes my heart soar! 

'As you can imagine, they and my extended family have experienced so many things (liberal media-driven) that may have crushed others without a strong foundation of faith, and I'm thankful for our friends' prayer shield that surrounds them, allowing faith to remain their anchor. 

'Thank you, prayer warriors! I love you!'

The post was accompanied by pictures of Bristol firing a rifle, other family photos.

She also linked to an article by Bristol condemning reports that suggest Todd and Sarah Palin are getting divorced.

Bristol's post, topped with a picture of her father kissing her mother, blasted the reports as 'garbage'.

The comments are the first from the family following widespread media attention to the fight on September 6.

On Monday, Sarah Palin emerged for the first time following the melee as she was photographed sweaty and make-up free running errands around Anchorage, Alaska.

The Palin family were recently caught up in a reported disturbance at a house party in Anchorage

The fight which allegedly broke out at a house party most of the Palin family was attending came as daughter Willow's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in some unspecified 'questionable behavior'.  

RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. 

The source said oldest son Track, 25, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him'.

That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his 50th birthday that night, although it was not his party- became involved.

Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America: 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, 'You know who we are, don't you?''

But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!'

Her son Track served with the U.S. Army in the Iraq War.

According to the source, Track left the fight nursing four cracked ribs, while his father suffered a bloody nose.

The former vice presidential candidate has yet to publicly comment on the brawl. 

On Monday, she left a shopping mall dressed casually, and without wearing her wedding ring.

Her daughters Bristol, 23, and 13-year-old Piper were also spotted out and about on Monday in Anchorage, stocking up on food supplies at a CostCo. 

The two sisters looked serious as they pushed a cart into the parking lot, filled to the brim with bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, apple sauce, yogurt and whipped cream.

Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. 

She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.'

But the source said that Bristol is left-handed.

One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. 

Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend.

The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 

'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. 

'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence.

'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made.

'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.'

Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office. 

It had been reported that the drunken brawl started when the Palin pack allegedly had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20 (pictured to the left of her mother, in a blue dress). The Palins are pictured in 2007

Sarah Palin has claimed that she owes the United States a 'global apology' for the 2008 Republican presidential ticket's loss to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Mrs Palin, who ran for vice-president on John McCain's ticket, spoke about Obama's long-term strategy for defeating ISIS, which he laid out in a speech on Wednesday night.

'As I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is, I owe America a global apology,' she said. 

'Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.'

She added: 'It's not just a vision that's so obvious. It's an articulated mission that they're on, and that is the caliphate. That is a takeover of the region. And guess what? We're next on the hit list.'

The former Alaskan governor compared ISIS to Hitler and questioned how seriously Obama is taking the threat.

She said: 'So when Barack Obama, like the rest of us, hear these bad guys, these terrorists, promising that they will raise the flag of Allah over our White House, for the life of me I don't know why he does not take this serious, the threat. Because yes, it's more than a vision.

'They're telling - just like Hitler did all those years ago, when a war could've been avoided, because Hitler, too, did not hide his intentions. Well, ISIS, these guys aren't hiding their intentions either.'
