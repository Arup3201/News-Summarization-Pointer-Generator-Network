If anyone tells you that international football is in decline and dying a slow death it would be worth showing them this video below.

Euphoria: Argentina players celebrated wildly in the changing room after beating Belgium in the World Cup

Dance: Sergio Aguero (centre) jumps around in celebration in the changing room after the match in Brazil

That's Sergio Aguero you can see skipping - and skipping really is the only word for it - around the dressing room as Argentina players celebrate after beating Belgium in the World Cup. The song they are singing is their fans' anthem, 'Brasil, decirme que sientes?/Brazil tell me how it feels?'

This is it how it feels to be a successful national team, something an entire generation of England players know nothing about. When was the last tournament match involving England that could have merited such a celebration? Possibly in Euro 2004, when Croatia were beaten 4-2 and England went into a quarter final full of confidence.

That means anyone 20 or under has only fuzzy memories of an England side inspiring the nation. So that includes Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and John Stones; Phil Jones may have a distant memory of those times; Danny Welbeck and Jordan Henderson could probably recall it; only Wayne Rooney has actually played in a team that made the country feel good about itself, albeit briefly.

To reach back to times when English players surprised the nation by captivating them this current team would have to ask coach Gary Neville to tell them his war stories from Euro 96 or quiz celebrities such as Gary Lineker, only known to them as TV presenters, about Italia 90.

And that is why Monday night's 2-0 win in Basel was so important. It's not going to prompt celebrations to match Argentina's, nor should it. There won't be a bus-top parade around London just yet.

But perhaps we caught a glimpse of something on and off the pitch. It was there in the sight of Joe Hart leaping into the arms of Jordan Henderson at the end and in the way the team all went over to applaud the travelling fans after the match. Perhaps it was even present in the way in which the team embraced, arms round shoulders, for the national anthem. It is a a tantalising glimpse of a generation beginning to understand what a successful national team could look like; more importantly what it could feel like.

The narrative about the decline of international football is a peculiarly English obsession. It's not a debate flagged up in Spain, even after last summer's World Cup debacle; nor in Germany. And that video clip shows some of the best players in the world celebrating in a manner which suggests that international football may have an awful lot of life left in it yet.

The reason why this debate has traction in England is that our national team has been so bad for so long whilst, at the same time, the Premier League has become steadily better. It's essentially an Anglo-centric view of the world.

But I would hazard a guess that winning with your national team surpasses anything you achieve with your club. Perhaps it's because the shared cultural background with your team-mates can make you seem a closer-knit group: the jokes, the songs, the reference points you all have in common cannot be shared as easily in a multi-national dressing room.

Pointing the way: England coach Gary Neville (right) can also talk of England's success at Euro 96

Adoration: England were embraced and loved by supporters for their successes during Euro 96

Bright spark: Raheem Sterling (pictured) and England's youngsters must deliver on the international stage

Conversely, as the world becomes more global and diverse, national identities become even more important.

But probably it is because no matter how well you do with Manchester United or Barcelona or Bayern Munich you will never experience the gratitude of an entire nation.

Young players in Germany, Spain and Holland know that from experience; at another level, so do those from Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile, Algeria, Uruguay, USA and Belgium. England's will have to learn it from the history books. But they too should look at that video clip of Sergio Aguero skipping around his dressing room singing. There can't be a much better feeling than that for a professional footballer.

Altogether now: England perform a huddle before kick-off, showing what it means to play for your country
