Maurice Travis, 33, who stabbed to death a fellow inmate during a cookery class and is on the run

A convicted murderer who formed a 'blood bond' while serving time with a racist killer dubbed 'The Madman' has gone on the run while on day release.

Maurice Travis, 33, was serving life for stabbing another inmate to death - but he had been granted 'temporary licence' after serving almost 16 years of his sentence ahead of being parole.

He was last seen on Wednesday in the Werneth area of Oldham, Greater Manchester where his family used to live.

Despite his criminal history police say is not believed to be 'significant' threat to the public - although the public are warned not to approach him.

Travis was serving five months for robbery in a young offender institution when he met and shared a cell with shaven headed Robert Stewart - who has a cross and the words RIP tattooed on his forehead.

He and Stewart would 'incite' each other with violent fantasies and later Travis killed fellow inmate lan Averall, 17, in jail during a row over a piece of birthday cake.

After the killing Travis and Stewart swapped letters and phone calls talking about carrying out a further murder - and Stewart later beat an Asian cellmate to death as he lay sleeping their cell.

During a statement to a public inquiry Travis claimed he were Stewart were going to kill Averall together and added: 'He follows me its like he worships everything I do.

'I know it wouldn't be long before he killed somebody. There was a situation when we spoke on the telephone or wrote and I suggested to him that he killed his padmate.

'I just told him to do it to him and he did it. I am prepared to take some of the blame for this.'

Det Ch Insp Mike Mangan said of Greater Manchester Police: 'While we do not believe Travis presents a significant threat to the public, he is unlawfully at large and he needs to be returned to prison.

'I would ask anyone with information about where he currently is, has been or could be heading contacts us in confidence.'

Travis is white, 5ft 9in tall and has short cropped brown hair. He was wearing black jeans, black jacket with white motif on top of left shoulder and white trainers. He has links to Tameside, Oldham and Salford areas

Travis and Stewart had originally been cellmates at Hindley Young Offender Institute in Wigan in the 1990s where they admitted started fires at the jail because they thought it was 'funny.'

In 1997 a nurse overheard the pair talking to each other about their violent fantasies, and was so shocked that she wrote a security report warning that they could 'endanger their own lives and possibly others'.

But the report was never acted on.

Then, on June 23 1998 after they were transferred to Stoke Heath in Market Drayton, Shropshire Travis, stabbed inmate lan Averall on his 17th birthday during a cookery class.

It was believed Stewart has planned the killing talking of cutting convicted burglar Averall's throat.

But although he was arrested on suspicion of murder - and even handed Travis the murder weapon - he was not charged.

Stewart was transferred to Feltham young offender institute in connection with a separate trial. He was later moved into the same cell as Zahid Mubarek

It emerged the fatal stabbing happened shortly after Averall had taunted Travis by saying he could not have a piece of his birthday cake, which had been prepared during a lesson.

Travis was later given life in jail after he admitted murder.

After the killing Stewart wrote a letter for Travis saying: 'What's done is done. Everyone thinks am next. Let's wait and see. If I get out in four weeks, it could be the first murder of the millennium! Ha ha.

Another said: 'After all dat bisness, I got the orderly job in the cooking class. Handling knives all day. Ha! Ha!'

Shortly into 2000, following the sending of this letter, Stewart was transferred to Feltham young offender institute in connection with a separate trial. He was later moved into the same cell as Zahid Mubarek.

On 21 March 2000, Stewart battered Zahid, 20, with a table leg in the middle of the night.Stewart, now 33, was jailed for life in November 2000 for Zahid's murder and has been held in Woodhill Category A prison.

A public inquiry later said prison chiefs missed 14 chances to save Zahid and seemed 'oblivious to the danger' of placing psychopath Stewart, in the same cell as the 19-year-old.

According to the Commission for Racial Equality's report on the murder, one prisoner said of Stewart: 'I called him Madman. Other prisoners had names for him like Sicko.'
