Bradford coach James Lowes has put the finishing touches to his new-look squad for the 2015 Championship season with the signing of scrum-half Harry Siejka from Wakefield.

The 22-year-old Australian, who made just nine Super League appearances for the Wildcats in 2014, has signed a two-year deal with the relegated Bulls and completes Lowes' 30-man full-time roster.

Siejka, an Australian schoolboy international, made his NRL Debut for Penrith Panthers in 2011 and also had stints with New Zealand Warriors and St George Illawarra before moving to Super League in February.

"I like what I have seen of Harry," said Lowes. "He came over on the back of a pretty bad injury and has not yet managed to fulfil his potential but he is an excellent scrum-half and we are delighted to have him on board.

"I liken him to Bobbie Goulding. He can break the line, has a great kicking game and is the kind of guy who is not afraid of getting stuck in.

"I feel sure Harry has some great years ahead of him and am hoping he will form a solid partnership with Lee Gaskell in the halves."

Siejka will be introduced to his new team-mates early next month in time for the start of pre-season training.

Before moving to Wakefield, Siejka played for Penrith Panthers in home country Australia
