Hywel Basham, from Newport in South Wales, who was jailed for attacking his sister Sally Edwards with the knife used to cut their mther's birthday cake

A brother was jailed yesterday for stabbing his own sister with the knife they had just used to cut their mother's birthday cake.

Hywel Basham, 43, repeatedly stabbed older sister Sally Edwards until the eight-inch blade snapped off.

The pair, with a history of sibling rivalry, were at the birthday celebrations of their mother Elaine Basham, 73, when they rowed over money.

A court heard Basham picked up the kitchen knife to stab his sister in the head while horrified guests looked on.

After the vicious attack Basham gloated: 'I hope it's still in the back of her head.'

Prosecutor Mike Jones said: 'They are
a brother and sister with a long history of sibling rivalry. Basham and
his sister Sally were at the home of their mum Elaine to celebrate her 
73rd birthday.

'Basham asked his mum for money but 
his sister objected, so he stabbed and kicked her on the ground. His mum
tried to stop him but he pushed her on to the sofa.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard Basham 
picked up the kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed his sister in the 
head and slashed her back until the handle broke.

Ms Edwards suffered stab wounds to the head, a seven-inch slash wound to her back and severe bruising to her body.

Mr Jones said: 'She has no doubt that 
if he hadn't broken the handle of the knife and if nobody else had been 
there, she would have been killed.'

Ms Edwards told the court she suffers panic attacks, nightmares and flashbacks of the attack triggered by simply closing her eyes.

The
court heard Basham hated his older sister and previously threatened to 
strangle her and stab her to death, telling her, 'Ill stick a knife in 
you' and 'I'll get you one day.'

Basham
had taken a cocktail of drink and drugs including two pints of cider 
and methadone.before attending his mum's birthday party.

Cardiff Crown Court, where Basham, of Newport, South Wales, admitted attempted murder and was jailed for nine years

Stephen Thomas, defending, said it was an unpremeditated attack committed in an 'uncontrolled rage'.

Basham, of Newport, South Wales, admitted attempted murder and was jailed for nine years. He was also banned from contacting his sister for life.

Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'This was an horrific scene for all those present. I find with no hesitation that you pose a significant risk of offending and causing serious harm to the public.

'The family have suffered a traumatic and horrendous incident and I have no doubt they will take many years to feel better and heal emotionally.'

Ms Edwards said after the hearing: 'I just want to forget about it. I'm having so many nightmares. I'm trying to move on.'
