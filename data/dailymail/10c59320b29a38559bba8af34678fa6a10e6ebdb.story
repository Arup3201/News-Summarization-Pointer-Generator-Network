The house price boom is predicted to last for another five years meaning the average cost of a home will jump by £43,000.

Prices in some areas will rocket by a third by 2018, according to estate agents Savills, fuelling a growing gap between homeowners and those who cannot afford to buy.

The property seller forecasts the average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in the next five years – from £171,000 to £214,000.

It comes as house prices surged by 6.9 per cent annually in October, continuing their fastest rise in more than three years, Halifax has reported.

A 0.7 per cent month-on-month increase took prices to £171,991 on 
average - marking the ninth monthly rise in a row as the new phase of 
the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme was launched.

The annual increase was the strongest since May 2010 and follows a 6.2% year-on-year upswing the previous month.

But the jump will be even greater in some regions, with average prices expected to rise by 32 per cent in the South East and 31 per cent in the East. A 24 per cent increase is forecast in London.

Savills said that fuelled by an economic recovery, the upswing in prices is likely to be strongest in the South of England following 'a modest, but progressive improvement in mortgage lending'. 

Its report said that the 'ripple effect' from London is 'long overdue'.

Lucian Cook, of Savills, insisted yesterday that widespread fears of a housing bubble are misplaced.

He said: ‘We see no evidence of an imminent housing bubble and think it an unlikely prospect.’

Soaring house prices, and a predicted rise in the number of people buying property, will trigger a huge windfall for the Treasury through stamp duty.

By 2018, the fee could be worth £9.4billion a year, according to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. At its previous peak in 2007/8, the year the financial crisis struck, stamp duty was worth £6.7billion, but the value of the tax to the Treasury is set to balloon.

Yesterday the Council of Mortgage Lenders said the amount of money paid by homebuyers ‘reinforces the need for reform’ of the ‘much-criticised’ tax.

Stamp duty used to be charged at 1 per cent on all homes bought for more than £60,000. Today it is charged at five different rates – up to 7 per cent on homes bought for more than £2million.

Around half of stamp duty is paid by people buying homes for more than £500,000.

In a sign of Britain’s increasingly unaffordable housing market, the average cost of a one-bedroom home has surpassed £500,000 in areas of the capital including Chelsea, Kensington, Balham, Barnes and Battersea.

A report from estate agents Marsh & Parsons revealed the average price of a one-bedroom property has jumped by 14 per cent in a year, an increase of £62,000.

House prices have been rising every year since 1996, apart from a short pause during the recent recession, according to Halifax.

The bank’s house price index, which began in 1983, an average rise of 5.6 per cent a year over the last 30 years.

In a sign of the property crisis facing young people, the Government’s English Housing Survey, shows home ownership is collapsing.

At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were ‘owner-occupiers’. Today the figure is just 65.3 per cent. And the majority of England’s 14.4million homeowners, 30 per cent, are aged 65 and over.

Duncan Stott, of first-time buyers’ campaign group, Priced Out, said: ‘Such steep increases will be a disaster for first-time buyers who are already struggling to afford the high cost of a home of their own.’

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is calling for new rules which would cap house price rises at a maximum of 5 per cent  a year.

Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said that outside central London, the housing market is still “far from boom territory”.

He said: 'With household finances still fragile after five years of falling real earnings, we are not convinced that a country-wide boom is around the corner.'

He said recent speculation that the Government is considering a capital gains tax on overseas property buyers 'is perhaps an early signal that the authorities are becoming more aware of the risks of another house price bubble inflating'.

Much of the recent sharp increase to property prices in prime central London has been put down to strong demand from overseas buyers looking for a safe haven to invest amid the troubles of the eurozone.

Halifax pointed out that ultra-low interest rates, as the base rate remains at a historic 0.5 per cent low, have put mortgage payments for new borrowers at their most affordable for 14 years, which is helping to fuel demand.

Mortgage payments typically take up 27 per cent of disposable earnings for a new mortgage borrower, the lowest proportion since 1999 and well below the average of 36 per cent over the past 30 years.

The new phase of Help to Buy, which offers state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent, had been expected to get under way in January, but it was brought forward to last month in a surprise move by the Government.

State-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of Scotland are offering products under the scheme and other major lenders including HSBC and Santander have confirmed their plans to join at a later date.

Despite the strong price uplifts, Halifax said the quarterly measure of price rises has shown some signs of a slight cooling off.

Prices in the three months to October were 1.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months. This rate is below the increases of 2 per cent or above recorded in each of the previous four months.

Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said: 'Low interest rates, and higher consumer confidence supported by the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be under way, are helping to increase housing demand.

'Schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy also appear to have boosted demand.'

He added: 'Sentiment towards selling has also improved in recent months in response to the pick-up in the market, which should help to increase the availability of properties on the market over the coming months.'
