Most of the UK will be hit by severe weather on Monday with 60-70mph winds

The worst storms for 15 years are on the way as the tail end of a hurricane hits our shores this weekend.

Gales of up to 80mph will set in tomorrow night, prompting warnings of damage to buildings, falling trees, flooding and transport chaos.

The Met Office issued a rare near-nationwide weather alert for Monday and said there were no areas that could be ruled out.

The warning comes as the remains of Hurricane Katia, which whipped up 22ft waves off the U.S. east coast, move across the Atlantic today.

By the time Katia reaches the UK, the winds will be just below tropical storm force – the same level as those that hit New York last month.

After a cloudy day today and tomorrow, stormy winds will hit the South West, Midlands, North of England and Scotland tomorrow evening.

A yellow alert – which warns people to be on their guard – has been issued for all of the country except the South East, but this could be upgraded to the more serious amber level today as the storm closes in.

The warning, says: 'The public should be aware of the risk of disruption to transport and of the possibility of damage to trees and structures.'

Weather expert Tom Tobler from MeteoGroup UK said:: 'It is looking like the storms will hit early Monday morning with the most severe weather coming in the middle of the day.

'Gusts over 60mph will be seen quite widely over northern and central Scotland and Northern Ireland and even down into northern England.

Eye of the storm: Hurricane Katia looks set to batter the UK with winds of 80mph and sea swells reaching 50ft

"The maximum gusts in western 
Scotland could quite easily get up to 75 or 80mph and potentially it 
could get above that. It could cause disruption and uproot trees 
especially as they still have a lot of leaves on being early autumn.'

Winds are expected to ease during the
week but it will remain blustery across much of the country with 
southern areas experiencing gusts of up to 45mph.

Fooding is possible along the western 
coasts of England and Scotland, although no specific local flood alerts 
have yet been issued.

Met 
Office forecaster Helen Chivers said it could be the strongest storm 
since 1996, when winds of 90mph caused huge disruption after the remains
of Hurricane Lili reached Britain from the U.S.

She said: ‘We are urging people to keep checking for updates on the weather warnings.

‘All areas could potentially see the impacts of Katia with wind gusts of 60-70mph across England and up to 80mph in Scotland.’

While it is not unusual for the 
remains of hurricanes to hit Britain, the effects of Katia will be 
stronger than usual because it has crossed the Atlantic so quickly.

England and Wales will see less windy weather on Tuesday before it clears on Wednesday.

The Environment Agency is advising residents in coastal areas to sign up for flood alerts on its website.

Storm bound: Fierce winds and torrential rain will strike much of the UK including parts that are not in the path of Hurricane Katia
