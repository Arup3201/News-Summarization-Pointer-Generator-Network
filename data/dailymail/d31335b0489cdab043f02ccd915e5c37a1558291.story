Aaron Hernandez took the stand today for a pretrial hearing, his first time in court since being arraigned on a murder charge.

The former New England Patriots player had sharpened up his appearance with a suit and tie at court in Fall River, Massachusetts.

He took the stand to answer a series of yes-no questions from the judge about a potential conflict of interest involving one of his lawyers.

Hernandez has been indicted in the 
killing of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player 
who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.

Hernandez's defense attorney Michael Fee is a partner at law firm Ropes and Gray - as is the Assistant DA Patrick Bomber's wife.

Fee told the court that his association with a prosecutor's wife will not affect his representation of Hernandez.

The former football player, who wore a tie for the first time in court, agreed to keep Fee as his lawyer. At one point the judge allowed a request to have Hernandez's handcuffs removed.

Prosecutors in the murder case also filed a motion on Wednesday to ask Judge Susan Garsh to recuse herself.

Prosecutor William McCauley and the district attorney say in a memo that McCauley and Garsh 'have a well-known and publicly documented history of antagonism'.

Hernandez's lawyers say they'll object to a recusal. Garsh didn't hear arguments on the issue.

The 23-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murder and five-related weapons charges. He is being held without bail.

Four others, including Hernandez's girlfriend and cousin, face charges in the case.

Lloyd, a semi-professional player, was found dead less than a mile from his home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts on June 17.

Hernandez is also being investigated by a grand jury over the deaths of Danny Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, soon after they left a nightclub in Boston.

A friend of the two victims, who has refused to be named, has told Fox25 last week that he saw the ex-Patriots player shoot the two men while shouting: 'What up negroes?'

He said that the three friends, all immigrants from Cape Verde off the coast of Africa, had been partying at Cure nightclub in Boston's Theater District, and had not been in any fights.

They left the club at 2am, he said, and 
drove home - but when they were stopped at a red light, an SUV pulled up
next to them and someone inside started shooting.

'They were shooting everywhere inside the car, front to back,' he said. 'They just came to kill. That's it.'

He
had no idea who had committed the brutal killings - but when Hernandez 
was arrested over Lloyd's death in June this year, the witness thought 
he recognised him as the gunman.

'When
I see his face, I just recognise his face,' he told Fox25. 'Compare his
face that night to his face now. It's that face that I remember.'

The
man now says he is desperate to discover the motive behind the murder, 
and complained that Hernandez has not yet been charged over his friends'
death.

'I don't understand why it takes so long,' he said. 'Every street has cameras around there.'

Sacked: Hernandez had his contract cancelled by the New England Patriots after he was arrested

Last month it emerged that Hernandez was caught on surveillance camera at the same club as Abreu and Furtado on the night of their death.

Boston police commissioner Ed Davis told Fox25 that the case was still under investigation and expressed optimism that it would reach a conclusion soon.

Officials believe that Hernandez may have killed Lloyd to stop him speaking out about last year's murders, according to reports.

His Patriots contract was cancelled as soon as he was arrested, and the team offered to swap all replica jerseys bearing his name which were handed in by fans.
