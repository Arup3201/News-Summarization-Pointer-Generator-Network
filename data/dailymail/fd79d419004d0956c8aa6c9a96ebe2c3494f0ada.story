Have you ever experienced deeply pleasurable, distinctly non-sexual tingles that begin in the back of your head and spread down throughout your body and limbs, triggered by certain sounds, physical sensations such as someone cutting your hair or even watching someone complete mundane tasks such as diligently filling in paperwork?

If you have, you are experiencing what is being referred to as ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, or head orgasms, head tingles, 'AIHO' (attention-induced head orgasm), 'AIE' (attention-induced euphoria).

ASMR is a recently discovered phenomenon, that like so many others, came to light through the internet and now has its own dedicated fan-base, research page and soon, the first scientific study looking into brain patterns of people experiencing ASMR.

Tingly: The sounds and sensations of a haircut are a trigger for many who experience Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response

The ASMR Facebook page, which has 5,417 members, describes the phenomenon as 'a pleasant, often intense tingling sensation that begins in the head and travels down the body to varying extents.'

'It is often accompanied by a euphoric feeling, and can overwhelm the experiencer of a particularly strong ASMR event. Some ASMR experiencers are triggered from an uncontrolled external stimulus; other experiencers can control an ASMR event through conscious thought triggers.'

A quick YouTube search for AMSR turns up thousands of videos. Most commonly, they are young women, speaking in soft, whispery monotones about nothing in particular. 

Birds of a feather: ASMR proponent 'Heather Feather' brushes her hair for hours for the listening pleasure of the ASMR community

One particularly interminable one made by 'Heather Feather' begins with a breathy explanation of what the viewer is about to see: Heather Feather brushing her hair while it's wet. Then, she plans to dry the hair, and then brush her hair while it's dry - all for your aural pleasure. The video goes for more than an hour and has 32,604 views.

Another, made by theWaterWhispers and called Let Me Take Care of You, features a young woman in a maternal/nursemaid role, caressing the camera, speaking softly to it, and assuring it that it's going to be OK, and dabbing its fevered brow with a washcloth. For 13 minutes.

One might expect such videos to be the object of ridicule, but it's just the opposite - people seem to let down their guard and let a stranger's soft whispers or the sound of someone brushing their hair comfort them.

Margaret Bennett commented on Let Me Take Care of You: 'Thank you very much for﻿ making this; couldn't seem to wind down till I found this, and now I'm all tingly and warm... time to crawl into bed and finally sleep. I'll definately [sic] be poking around on your channel.'

berecca123 said, 'This is by far my favorite video! Please do another similar because I could probably recite this due to how many﻿ times I've watched it haha. I LOVE the wet towel and the tucking in. It made me feel so cozy :) thanks a lot Xxxx.'

Comfort: Ilse at theWaterWhispers dabs her camera's hot forehead with a a damp washcloth in the immensely popular Let Me Take Care of You video

The owner of theWaterWhispers channel, who refers to herself as Ilse in her videos, is a Dutch ASMR enthusiast who has a high standing in the AMSR community, such as it is. She's made 211 videos, which include 'Saleswoman role play - shoe shopping', where she pretends to sell you a pair of shoes, 'Relaxing chocolate tasting' and another where she talks - whispers - the viewer through her grandmother's jewellery collection. It's edge-of-your-seat stuff. But again, for the ASMR community, this stuff is like a drug.

Another commenter wrote that 11:40 was his favorite part of the jewelry video - featuring Ilse scraping her finger over an earring.

In her videos she refers to herself as Ilse, but when she spoke to MPBN, she said her name was Maria. She said some of the subscribers to her videos include soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

'And they share with me how much they struggle with their nightmares that they get,' she said.

'And the ASMR whisper videos, they actually help them fall asleep better, which is amazing because they sometimes say medications don't work, but these videos work instead.'

There are also 'unintentional' ASMR videos - instructional videos such as someone demonstrating Japanese bookbinding, making origami or, as many ASMR experiencers say, the late Bob Ross, whose combination of softly spoken words and demonstrating technique seems to push a lot of ASMR buttons.

Unintentional: It's unlikely the maker of this instructional video had any idea it would be a trigger for ASMR

It's unlikely that AMSR is a new phenomenon. YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have changed the way people communicate and share ideas and information - there's a forum for everything and our tendency to 'overshare' online has created diverse interest communities.

AMSR is the same - it began in 2009, a Yahoo! group called the Society of Sensationalists formed  'in hopes of finding people who experience the same sensation.'

In 2010 Andrew MacMuiris started a blog called The Unnamed Feeling, on which is a timeline of ASMR. That same year  Jenn Allen, who founded the site asmr-research.org site, and coined the term AMSR.

After that point, the timeline becomes crowded with events, media attention and group meetings. In September 2012 an ASMR app was released for Apple iOS.

So where to next for the mysterious ASMR and its devoted community? After Wikipedia took down its ASMR page because it lacked any peer-reviewed research or even proof, a Reddit user and Dartmouth College undergrad Bryson Lochte announced that he plans to perform brain scans to study it for his thesis.

Lochte plans to release his preliminary discoveries on ASMR in the next few months. We're tingling with anticipation.
