England’s seven-game winning streak does not include Italy. Lithuania, but not Italy. Slovenia, but not Italy. San Marino and Estonia, but not Italy.

So the idea that the heat has been taken out of Harry Kane’s full debut for his country by a string of victories since last summer’s World Cup does rather overlook a salient fact. That England’s seven wins, as welcome as they may be, are against the also-rans of European football.

Only Slovenia are on course to qualify automatically for the European Championship at the halfway stage — by coming a distant second to England — while Norway, Switzerland and Scotland are in third place in their respective groups, Lithuania lie fourth, Estonia fifth and San Marino where they always are. This is not Roy Hodgson’s fault. His players can only beat what is in front of them.

Yet just as Hodgson is trying to play down the clamour around Kane, playing down the euphoria around England’s present run may be equally wise.

It is not a year since England’s poorest World Cup finals performance in recent memory and what we do know is that when a group of players that are the scourge of the Baltic nations plus an odd mountain range or two came up against Italy in Manaus last June, they did not have the wit to win.

That is where Kane comes in. Italy and England may be depleted in Turin, but certain standards remain. Italy’s defence will be of a calibre England have not experienced since the World Cup. Their ambition will be greater than that of previous opponents, too.

This is a genuine test for Kane, in a way his cameo role against Lithuania wasn’t. He will not have played against a team of Lithuania’s standard since he was being farmed out by his club on loan to gain experience.

Lithuania fielded a starting back four featuring players from Rangers, Hapoel Haifa, Zalgiris Vilnius and Cambuur of Holland. On Tuesday, he will play against two of the men who have powered Juventus to the pinnacle of Italian football — Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci — plus Andrea Ranocchia of Inter Milan. It is an upgrade.

And that is what England require of Kane, too: an upgrade. Hodgson knows he already has the players to qualify for a major tournament — but he didn’t have ones who could muscle past Italy or Uruguay once there. The hope is Kane could change that.

At the moment we are left asking questions to which we probably know the answer. Why is Danny Welbeck so prolific for England — Europe’s top scorer in the current qualifying campaign, no less — yet still finding his feet with Arsenal?

Why is Raheem Sterling’s form so inconsistent for Liverpool, yet so vital for England?

The explanation can be found in that Lithuanian back four. When does Welbeck get to play against defenders at the level of the Scottish Championship with Arsenal?

When does Sterling face opposition such as Cambuur?

Raheem Sterling comes up against better quality opposition for Liverpool than when playing for England

Chelsea send their promising youth-team players to Vitesse Arnhem on loan, and they often make the first team. Vitesse are currently fifth in the Eredivisie; Cambuur are 10th.

The last time they met, on February 4, two Chelsea players featured for Vitesse, who won 2-0.

So that is what Welbeck and England were up against on Friday — defenders who might not quite be at the level of Chelsea’s best youngsters. Faced with John Terry in the Premier League, different rules apply.

Yet against Terry on January 1, Kane nhad one of his best games of the season.

He is English football’s top scorer playing often against players with the quality we shall witness on Tuesday night.

What Hodgson must be hoping is that in Turin he sees a player who can take England beyond. Wayne Rooney was Europe’s top scorer on the way to South Africa in 2010, too. Having qualified, England failed to attain the necessary level when competing in the finals.

Hodgson talked of Kane on Monday as a squad player being given the chance to show what he can do — albeit with one of his most promising lines of supply severed as Sterling is back on Merseyside nursing a minor injury.

Yet he is more than just that. If Kane demonstrates that he can pose a genuine threat to high- level defenders, he has the capability to change the way England approach matches.

Welbeck does a job for Hodgson, but that is what it is: a job.

It is a good job — he is the player Hodgson relies upon when he is concerned the opposition has superior technique — but it has limitations.

Welbeck works hard, he closes down, he has pace on the counter-attack — and he does exactly what the manager asks of him. And, for now, that is enough. Welbeck has been prolific as England power through the mediocrities.

Extra is needed in France in 2016, however, if England are to be more than just present.

Hodgson must discover match-winners, players who have the beating of contenders like Italy.

So Tuesday night is much more than a friendly for Kane.

This is a moment when he has the opportunity to alter the potential of English football and, if successful, we shouldn’t be frightened to embrace this.
