A number of travelling Chelsea supporters were teargassed by French police outside the Parc des Princes before and after kick-off on Tuesday night.

A section of the away support are understood to have been kettled and teargassed outside a bar in the city centre, as well as around 200 supporters who, 10 minutes after the start, were still trying to get into the stadium.

The scenes in the French capital will mar a closely-fought Champions League last 16 first leg contest that ended as a 1-1 draw between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.

The unsavoury incident involving the French police and travelling Chelsea fans is the second time this season that English away fans have clashed with officials from across the Channel.

In October, many Everton fans were left shaken in Lille as policed used tear gas to break up clashes with rival supporters ahead of their Europa League tie.

Reports of pepper spray being used was also documented and one Everton fan was taken to hospital with a heavy bloodied gash above his left eye, after being hit by a CS Gas Canister fired by police.

That alleged attack was the second in as many days in northern France after a group of around 50 locals stormed a bar full of Everton supporters on the previous night.
