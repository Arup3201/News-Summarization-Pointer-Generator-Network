Following her husband's win in the 2008 presidential race, Michelle Obama wanted to stay with her daughters in Chicago rather than move to the White House, according to a new book.

The Obamas, written by a New York Times journalist and released on Tuesday, also claims the First Lady was ‘alone, frightened and unsure of what to do next’ after moving to Washington, D.C.

The book claims to lift the lid on the struggles the family faced following Obama's successful presidential bid, after which they were watched by everyone – not least the Secret Service.

Following the campaign, Michelle Obama was thinking about putting off the move to the White House, author Jodi Kantor claims.

Kantor, who began reporting on the Obamas in 2007, writes: ‘Only a handful of friends and aides knew what Michelle was considering: staying behind in Chicago with her daughters for the rest of the school year while the new president moved to Washington alone.’

The First Lady planned to commute between the two cities for a year, using the time to consider schools for the couple’s daughters, Malia and Sasha.

‘She was anxious about relocating her children to a new city in the middle of the school year,’ Kantor writes.

But her husband hated the idea, insisting he finally spend time with his family after years campaigning on the road.

Challenges: Mrs Obama felt subdued and alone during her first few months in the White House, the book claims

Protective: She also worried about how her girls, pictured in 2008, would fare growing up in the White House

Only when Mrs Obama visited the White House 
and was given a tour by her predecessor Laura Bush did she warm to the 
idea, according to the book.

But even then, she worried how her 
daughters would cope, believing ‘a presidential race was potentially a 
curse upon her children’, Kantor writes.

She feared White House tourists 
interrupting their play dates – and worried if she could trust other 
parents to look after the girls.

A few months into life at the White House, Mrs Obama ‘seemed spirited, enthusiastic, and active’, the book writes.

‘The truth, however was that the first lady was having an unhappy, difficult time in her new role.’

Fighter: The first lady persevered and now loves her role, realizing the impact it can have, the book says

She was deeply frustrated with 
elements of her new life, including the fact that she could no longer 
take her daughters to school functions without fear of causing a 
commotion. She also struggled living away from Chicago and lost touch with friends.

Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs has apologised for insulting Michelle Obama during an explosive staff meeting recounted in Kantor's book, The Obamas.

The argument erupted during a staff meeting in 2010, after Gibbs had dealt with a report that Mrs Obama had told French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy that she 'can't stand' life in the White House, that it was 'hell'.

In a private meeting, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett said Mrs. Obama was 'dissatisfied' with how he handled the situation and Gibbs shouted at Jarrett for getting involved. He reportedly swore, including once directed at Mrs. Obama.

On Monday, Gibbs said: 'In any high-pressure work environment 
there are occasional arguments and disagreements and that is certainly 
true of the White House. I regret speaking in anger and 
regret that this disagreement became so public.'

The Harvard-educated lawyer also felt
the role she perceived herself filling in the White House never 
materialised, and felt ignored by her husband’s advisers.

'She was stuck in a position with little definition and no clear goals,’ the book writes.

She went on to acknowledge how tough life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue can be.

‘Sometimes it becomes difficult to live in what we call a bubble,’ she said, according to the book.

But her outlook changed when, in April 2009, she visited London and spoke at a girls’ school – telling them that the world needed strong, female leaders.

‘We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be,’ she had said.

Watched by a sea of admiring girls, she understood for the first time what it meant to be First Lady.

‘She saw the responsibility, the impact, the potential of her role,’ Kantor writes.

In the early days, the pressure to both be perfect and look perfect was always on – and her choice of eye-catching clothes raised eyebrows among advisers.

She examined all of her outfits, realising that ‘everything she wore carried a meaning,’ Kantor writes.

She is now known for her flawless ensembles at night and outfits bought at chain stores during for the day.

‘Everyone was waiting for a black woman to make a mistake,’ an advisor told the author.

But she battled the pressure and fought against childhood obesity and defended her husband's drive to reform health care.

When Michelle Obama worked in the Chicago City Hall in the early 1990s, she was 'distressed' that a small group of 'white Irish Catholic' families had such a strong grip on Illinois, Kantor writes.

Mrs Obama worked for Mayor Daley between September 1991 and April 1993, according to City of Chicago personnel records.

She was supposedly concerned about the power of three families: the Daleys, the Hynes and the Madigans.

According to Kantor, Mrs. Obama ‘disapproved of how closely Daley held power, surrounding himself with three or four people who seemed to let few outsiders in - a concern she would echo years later with her own husband.

‘She particularly resented the way power in Illinois was locked up generation after generation by a small group of families, all white Irish Catholic - the Daleys in Chicago, the Hynes and Madigans statewide.’

Eventually, former aides say, Mrs Obama came to love her role as first lady.

‘It was natural that there would be a
period of transition when she and the family went from being a private 
family in Chicago to the first family of the United States,’ former 
White House deputy communications director Jen Psaki told ABC News.

The book also details the battles Mrs Obama endured against her husband’s aides.

It tells of a divided White House where tensions developed between Mrs Obama and then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.

Arguably
the most prominent point of contention Kantor reveals between the first
lady and Mr Emanuel was the friction over healthcare reform and Mrs 
Obama’s scepticism of so-called backroom deals being cut.

Mrs Obama ‘made it clear that she thought her husband needed a new team, according to her aides,’ Kantor writes.

From
past sour experiences with another White House wife – former first lady
and current Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton - Mr Emanuel 
tried to avoid Mrs Obama.

Ms
Kantor writes that the East and West wings became so separate from each
other that some referred to the East Wing as ‘Guam – pleasant but 
powerless.’

‘Michelle and Rahm Emanuel had almost no bond,’ Ms Kantor writes, saying that from the get-go, the two were awkward.

‘They were the president’s two spouses, in a sense, one public and official and one private and informal.’

The White House had a cold reaction to the book, calling it an 'over-dramatisation of old news' and emphasising that the first couple did not speak to the author, who last interviewed them for  magazine piece in 2009.

'The emotions, thoughts and private moments described in the book, though often seemingly ascribed to the president and first lady, reflect little more than the author's own thoughts,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

'These secondhand accounts are staples of every administration in modern political history and often exaggerated.'

The accounts are based on interviews with 30 current and former aides, though President Barack Obama and the first lady declined to be interviewed for the book.
