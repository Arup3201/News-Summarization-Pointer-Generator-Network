A woman who claims Michael Jordan is the father of her son is suing the star for child support, it has been claimed.

Pamela Smith has apparently filed legal documents demanding that the legendary basketball player submit to a paternity test to prove 16-year-old Taj is his son.

The teenager, who uses the surname Jordan, has in the past taken to the internet to insist that the former Chicago Bulls star is his father.

Ms Smith filed a paternity suit in a court in Fulton County, Georgia three weeks ago, according to TMZ.

In it, she claims that she and Mr Jordan had sex in 1995, when he was married to Juanita Vanoy, with whom he has three children.

She says her son Grant Pierce Jay Jordan Reynolds, known as Taj, was born in June 1996.

Ms Smith insists that Mr Jordan is the boy's father, and argues in the court documents that he should be forced to undergo a paternity test.

Appeal: Taj has said he wants Mr Jordan to be more involved with his life

The claimant is seeking child support payments and money for Taj's medical expenses.

She has also asked the judge handling the case to change her son's last name to Jordan officially.

In a video posted on YouTube last month, Taj said he was Mr Jordan's son and claimed he was in touch with the star.

Mr Jordan's representatives declined to comment on Ms Smith's claims.

This is not the first time he has been the subject of a paternity suit - in 1991, his former lover Karla Knafel claimed the star was the father of her child, but a DNA test proved that this was not the case.

Mr Jordan is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time.

He is now the owner and chairman of the Charlotte Bobcats, and is engaged to marry Yvette Prieto next month.
