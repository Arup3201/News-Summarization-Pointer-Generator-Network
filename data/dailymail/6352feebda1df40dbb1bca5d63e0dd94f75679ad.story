Another senior Sun journalist has been arrested over allegations of corrupt payments made to public officials, taking the total from the paper embroiled in the scandal to 11.

Defence editor Virginia Wheeler, 32, becomes the 23rd person to be detained by Scotland Yard as part of Operation Elveden. She was later released on bail.

The ten senior Sun employees arrested in the probe so far have included the deputy editor, the news editor, the paper's picture editor, its chief foreign correspondent and senior executives.

Latest blow: Virginia Wheeler, the newspaper's defence editor, becomes the 23rd person to be detained by Scotland Yard as part of Operation Elveden

The Sun’s deputy editor Geoff Webster, 
picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign 
correspondent Nick Parker, and news editor John Sturgis were arrested in February.

The previous month former 
managing editor Graham Dudman, 48, now a training director at News 
International; executive editor Fergus Shanahan, 56, a former deputy 
editor of the paper under Rebekah Brooks; long-serving crime editor Mike
Sullivan, 48; and head of news Chris Pharo, 42 were also detained and later bailed.

News International said its Management and Standards 
Committee (MSC) had provided information to the Elveden investigation 
which led to the arrests and had also provided the option of 'immediate 
legal representation' to those arrested.

But a defiant Rupert Murdoch, who flew in last month as the crisis engulfed the paper, cleared his
arrested staff members to go back to work, saying 
'everyone is innocent until proven guilty'.

Miss Wheeler has been on extended leave in recent months, a source revealed today

She is The Sun’s first female defence editor and reported from the front line in Libya last year.

She has been a Sun reporter for six years, reporting for the paper from Zimbabwe, Mexico, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and covering stories from the Asian Tsunami to Michael Jackson's death.

Power: Mr Yates has expressed 'extreme regret' for ruling out reopening the hacking investigation at News International in 2009

Last year, she spent almost two months in total in Haiti, covering the earthquake and The Sun's Helping Haiti appeal.

She works alongside defence colleague David Willetts covering the war in Afghanistan and any stories affecting the army.

Police are understood to have wanted to question her for several weeks, but she has been on holiday in Argentina.

A
serving member of the Armed Forces, a Ministry of Defence employee and a
Surrey Police officer have also been arrested during the probe, after it was extended to include public figures other than police.

There were claims that police and officials were paid around £100,000 in return for information.

The Metropolitan Police operation is 
drawing on information provided to police by the management standards 
committee at News Corporation, which owns titles The 
Sun, The Times and the now-defunct News of the World.

News International employees have accused the company of a ‘witch hunt’ after the internal management committee passed information to police that led to the arrests of members of staff at The Sun.

They have admitted to being concerned that more arrests were coming, in the week the Sun on Sunday was launched.

Mr Murdoch said the new title was 'the best answer to our critics'.

Police said the woman detained at a south London police station after being arrested by appointment.

A
spokesman said: 'Detectives from Operation Elveden have today arrested a
32-year-old woman by appointment on suspicion of corruption under the 
Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and aiding and abetting misconduct in a
public office (contrary to common law) and conspiracy in relation to 
both offences.'

She was later released on bail to return to a south London police station on a date in May pending further inquiries.

Operation Elveden - which runs alongside
the Met's investigation into phone hacking called Operation Weeting 
team - was launched as the scandal erupted last July with allegations 
about the now-defunct News of the World targeting Milly Dowler's mobile 
phone.
