A former town tax collector in Connecticut has been arrested on allegations she deleted important data from town computers after losing an election.

Cheryl Brundage, 54, erased more than 2,000 files from 400 folders - including tax payment information - only hours after the polls closed November 5, Wolcott police said on Thursday.

The files were backed up on a server and were able to be restored.

A former Connecticut town tax collector Cheryl Brundage has been arrested on allegations she deleted important data from town computers after losing an election

Brundage surrendered at the police station on Wednesday after learning there was a warrant for her arrest.

She was charged with felony computer crimes and released on a promise to appear in Waterbury Superior Court on January 30.

Brundage didn't immediately return a message a Thursday. It's not clear if she has a lawyer.

The Wolcott Whisper reported that before the election, the race for the tax collector position had led to 'mudslinging' between Brundage and her rival Darlene Dunn Tynan.

Brundage distributed flyers labeled 'Tax Collector Report Card' where she graded herself 'A' while giving Tynan 'Fs'.

Ms Tynan is now the tax collector for Wolcott, Connecticut.
