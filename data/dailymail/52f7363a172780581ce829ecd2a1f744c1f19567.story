Two 'petite' firearms officers who won a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns have spoken out against the 'malicious' police force amid claims they are being 'starved' back to work.

Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles won their sex discrimination case against the Civil Nuclear Constabulary on the grounds they could not reach the trigger at a hearing in February last year.

But now both women believe their careers are over, a remedy hearing at Central London Employment Tribunal heard today.

Ms Wheatley branded the organisation's attitude towards her as 'disgraceful' while Ms Giles claimed the case had brought her 'a great deal of stress and anxiety', adding: 'They are making me choose between my mental health and paying the bills.' 

Bullied: Firearms officer Rachael Giles, who sued the British Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) after claiming her firearm was too big for her small hand, says she has been bullied by the 'malicious' force

Both women, in their 30s, are still employed by the constabulary but are on sick leave due to stress on pensionable pay - resulting in them not getting full pay.

They had returned to work after winning their case last year but Miss Wheatley complained they only did 'menial' jobs which was 'completely belittling and humiliating.'   

They are part of the armed CNC and help protect power stations at Sellafield in Cumbria and Chapelcross in Dumfries and Galloway.

Both claimed at the original tribunal that their reputations were damaged because their unsuitable equipment - a Glock 17 - meant they received lower marks than men in firing range tests while protective gear was too big for their small heads and legs.  

The tribunal found the CNC guilty of indirect sex discrimination but dismissed claims of victimisation.

In going though the series of complaints made by the women today, John Cavanagh QC, representing the CNC, noted that Miss Giles felt the force's treatment of her has been 'malicious and unpleasant'.

Miss Giles, who was diagnosed with depression in February 2014, claimed: 'I believe that my career with the constabulary is at an end.'

She added that she has 'no faith in the constabulary and that I would be treated fairly'.

She suggested that her mental health has not been helped by the time it has taken to try and resolve the case, and even doubts whether the CNC believes they have done anything wrong.

She added: 'The constabulary has behaved in a particularly malicious manner. I believe this has been to intimidate.'

Mr Cavanagh also said that Miss Wheatley had claimed that she had been put on pensionable pay.

He noted that she believes 'this was an attempt to starve her back to to work so that the claim can be made that she is fit and well and totally unaffected'.

The women were also left disappointed because they felt nothing had changed in the force despite them winning their sex discrimination case last year.

Giving evidence today Dr Stephen Tyrer, a consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, told the tribunal: 'They were hoping for change but nothing happened.'

The psychiatrist added he believed both of the women were suffering from 'adjustment Disorder' - a short-term condition that occurs when a person has great difficulty coping with, or adjusting to, a particular source of stress.

Describing Miss Giles' condition further he added: 'She's had a depressive illness that has prompted treatment.

'It has taken a very long time to deal with and this has exasperated the claimants' mental health issues.'  

He believed both women would need a course of cognitive behaviour therapy to help combat their stress.

However the tribunal did hear the constabulary has since ordered an equality impact assessment and offered the women the chance to re-take their shooting tests with a G4 gun which has a smaller handle.

But Mr Cavanagh said: 'They had both rejected the offer that they could take the shooting test with a different gun with a smaller handle.'  

The constabulary had applied to appeal the decision but their application to appeal was rejected in June 2014. 

The hearing - expected to last four days - continues.
