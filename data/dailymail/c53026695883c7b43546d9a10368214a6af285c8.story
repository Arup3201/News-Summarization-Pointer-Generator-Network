A tenant has been sentenced to 10 years after being found guilty of stabbing his housemate to death in an argument over a blocked toilet.

James Biddinger, 27, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in March over the fatal stabbing of 22-year-old Kevin Mbayo in a townhouse in Germantown, Maryland in the US, in May 2011.

The property was home to several people who rented rooms, however Mbayo was not a tenant, but he had been living with his father Ernest Mbayo who rented a room at the address, according to the New York Post and myfoxny.com

During the trial, the court heard how Biddinger's seething resentment towards Mbayo became all-encompassing.

The 27-year-old was allegedly unhappy that Mbayo had lived at the townhouse without paying rent, and had been using a communal sofa in the home, the New York Post said.

On the night of the attack, Biddinger discovered that a toilet in the property had been clogged and blamed Mbayo for it. In the violent confrontation that ensued, he stabbed the younger man.

In sentencing on Friday, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge, Robert A. Greenberg, outlined his reasons for exceeding recommended punishment guidelines under Maryland law.

Greenberg said, according to the press reports, that Biddinger had brought a knife to confront Mbayo, fled the scene after the attack and had shed 'crocodile tears' when he was later told of Mbayo's death.

Biddinger had also attempted to persuade eyewitnesses against testifying, Greenberg said.

'Fortunately, you didn't succeed,' the judge added.

Biddinger, who has been in jail since his arrest in May 2011, will be eligible for parole after five years.

During the trial, the court heard how third housemate, Miles Edward Willis had heard the fight from his room, beneath the lounge.

He said he heard a loud thud, as if someone had fallen to the floor, according to gazette.net, from a March report on the trial.

Willis also found one of his kitchen knives with blood on it hidden on the kitchen counter six days after the fight, he testified.

Willis said he found the knife between a cereal box and the kitchen wall; he called police immediately to submit it as possible evidence.

Attorneys said in opening arguments Monday that Biddinger had taken the knife used in the stabbing with him when he left the house, throwing it out the car window as his friend drove him to the Wal-Mart before cooperating with police to locate the weapon that night.
