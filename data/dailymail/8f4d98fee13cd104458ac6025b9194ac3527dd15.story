An Australian photographic couple have captured a unique day at the races in rural Australia.

Perfect weather guaranteed big numbers at The Bombala Cup on Saturday in south-east New South Wales, as record breaking crowds flocked to the bush racing carnival day. 

'The consensus on the day was that it was the largest crowd in quite a few years', Paul McIver, one of the photographers on the day told Daily Mail Australia.  

'There was a wide cross-section of socio-economics - a lot of young people too who enjoyed getting dressed up'. 

The five hour event was filled with fashion,  champagne and of course horse racing - which was Mr McIver and his partner Judy Goggin's focus on the day.

'We were trying to give a bit of an overview of the general feel of a bush racing carnival day.

'The culture of the jockey - the bush jockey in an area that is very well known for it's horse heritage'. 

Before the six races kicked off, the crowd and the jockeys observed a minute of silence for two jockeys killed in accidents on tracks last week.

'Right after that a jockey and his horse took a tumble on the turf,' Mr McIver said. 

'It was a great day, everyone was vibrant and enjoying themselves.'
