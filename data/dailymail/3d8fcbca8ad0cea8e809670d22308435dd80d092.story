Areas with selective state schools dominated GCSE and A-level results last year, figures show.

The top ten performing local education authorities at A-level all had selective or partially selective systems.

Reading in Berkshire came top, with 45.9 per cent of pupils gaining AAB or equivalent in their sixth form exams in 2012, followed by Trafford in Greater Manchester with 34.5 per cent.

The average in the state sector is only 16.8 per cent. The high-performing authorities with selective schools also included Southend-on-Sea in Essex and Torbay in Devon, which have some of the worst areas of deprivation in the UK.

Seven of the top ten LEAs at GCSE also had grammar school places available to some or all of their pupils. They include Sutton in South London, where 75.9 per cent of pupils got five GCSEs at A* to C grade including English and maths, and Trafford with 72.4 per cent.

They came behind the Isles of Scilly, which scored 86.4 per cent but has only one school providing education up to the age of 16 at different sites, and Kensington and Chelsea, on 79.6 per cent, which is the wealthiest LEA in the country. The average for state schools was 59 per cent.

The information on the exam results of state schools in England was requested from the House of Commons Library by Tory MP Graham Brady, who resigned as a shadow minister for Europe in 2007 over David Cameron’s opposition to new grammar schools.

Mr Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said: ‘The tables show that selective and partially selective authorities tend to perform better than comprehensive ones and can help social mobility by getting state school pupils into the best universities and professions.

‘We should remove the restrictions imposed by the previous Labour government and allow communities to have selective schools if they want them.

‘Some schools might wish to be partially selective in intake and others wholly selective grammar schools.’

Only 164 state-run grammar schools remain in England. A few areas retain a formal grammar school system, using the 11 Plus exam to select the most able pupils. These include Trafford and Buckinghamshire.

The Conservative Party’s official line is that no new grammar schools are to be built, but some have been allowed to expand because of population growth.

Despite the lack of political will, selective schools remain very popular with the public.

Robert McCartney, of the National Grammar Schools Association, said research about five years ago showed England’s grammar schools had produced as many A and B grades at A-level as 1,500 comprehensives.

‘We have had two polls since 2010 which showed overwhelming demand for grammar schools,’ he said.

‘I think Cameron has bought into the idea that they are bastions of middle-class elitism – to which there is some truth but only because the places are so limited and competition so fierce that aspirational parents by and large are the ones who get places.’

The Department for Education declined to comment.
