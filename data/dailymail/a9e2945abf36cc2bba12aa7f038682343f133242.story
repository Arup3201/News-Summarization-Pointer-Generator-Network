With shacks assembled crudely from discarded pallets, wooden doors and plastic sheets, it resembles a shanty town.

But rather than Rio or Soweto, this ramshackle encampment is tucked between the trees just yards from joggers and dog-walkers in greater London’s biggest park.

Some 40 economic migrants now live in what is simply known as ‘The Camp’ – a base for Eastern Europeans seeking a better life in Britain.

The settlement, in north London’s Lee Valley Regional Park, lies in a leafy glade between a canal towpath and the busy North Circular Road.

A group of around 30 migrants from Eastern Europe have set up a 'shanty town' in some woodland on the banks of a canal in London 

The area of woodland, next to a busy roundabout in Edmonton, has been turned into a semi-permanent residence consisting of around 15 huts 

One of the camp's residents Marcel Ion, from Romania, is pictured standing outside his shack that he has built as temporary accommodation while he stays in the UK

Squatter Mr Ion, pictured inside his hut, is one of around 30 people who are currently living illagelly on the site in London

Two of the squattors in the camp, Nicole Florin and Marcel Ion, wash using a water bottle. The 'residents' have set-up different facilities for themselves on site

The two men, pictured at their makeshift dining table, are among around 30 residents who have set up homes on the area of woodland 

Mr Florin (left) and Mr Ion (right) say they have both been in the UK for three months and plan on staying until Christmas, before returning home to Romania

A notice has now been taped near onto a tree near the entrance of the camp, explaining that Transport for London - which owns the patch of land - will be taking the case to court on Friday 

The makeshift camp  has been set up in woodland next to the Lee Park Way canal in Edmonton, north London and has sparked anger among local residents 

Those living at the site - believed to be mainly from Romania - have created the set-up out of discarded timber, pallets and tents, pictured 

The migrants, believed to be mainly men, are sleeping inside the huts and tents and are believed to have been there for at least six months 

Marian Dumitrache, 30, from Buzau, Romania, left his home country six months ago to work in London – sending money home to his wife and two young children in the city. Wearing a Superman sweatshirt, he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby Chingford to claim he has ‘no choice’ but to live in the camp.

It is already at the centre of a row as many residents in nearby Edmonton view the shacks as a ‘filthy slum’ where migrants cook on open fires, wash in the canal and use the woods as a toilet.

Yesterday the Daily Mail was invited to tour the site by 30-year-old Roma gipsy Marian Dumitrache, who revealed how up to six migrants sleep in a room on bare mattresses and sit outside among makeshift tables, armchairs and abandoned shopping trolleys.

Mr Dumitrache left his native Romania six months ago to work in London – sending money home to his wife and two young children in the city of Buzau. Wearing a Superman sweatshirt, he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby Chingford to claim he has ‘no choice’ but to live in the camp.

‘No one likes the Roma gipsy. Living here is cold and uncomfortable but at least I can earn money painting and send that home.

‘But we are not living off other people or the state. The camp is deserted today because people are at work.’

He added: ‘We cook on camp fires and some people use the canal to wash. We are not really living here – we just about exist. It is very cold at night. We have no gas or electricity.’

Mr Dumitrache confirmed that Transport for London – which owns the land – had issued eviction papers and the police have served Asbos on individuals.

High Court documents also refer to the discovery of stolen car number plates and beer kegs on the site in recent months and of the health and safety concerns involving some 40 men living in the newly-erected suburban shanty town.

The Eastern Europeans in the camp come from Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. Mr Dumitrache entered Britain six months ago by car after showing his Romanian identity card to border officials.

Police have spent the past few weeks regularly visiting the site asking the men to move.

But the camp remains, and locals are angry that more has not been done to move them on. One said: ‘It’s a joke, nobody wants to live near a filthy slum.’

River Lea Anglers’ Club secretary John Weighell added: ‘It stinks to high heaven and you can see garbage hanging in the trees and bushes. It looks like a shanty town in Soweto or Rio. They are destroying the wildlife, intimidating the public and causing a nuisance.’

The illegal camps have been set up on land owned by Transport for London which said it is aware of the situation and is taking 'relevant legal action' 

Residents have complained that the camp is blighting the landscape and even affecting wildlife. One angler said two swans and their dozen signets have disappeared from the river since the migrants' arrival

Washing lines have been installed in the area, while garbage, clothes and plastic bags hang from the trees. There is no running water or electricity on site

Those who have set up the camp have created a makeshift living room, using an arm chair and a pouffe as a coffee table 

Two trolleys are pictured on site, one filled with rubbish. Residents have complained that the site is loaded with rubbish and has led to the usually serene atmosphere being destroyed

The woodland sits alongside the canal in Upper Edmonton, pictured, which residents say is iconic among walkers, boaters and anglers 

Pub landlord Shane Kilcrann, who runs the Old Hall Tavern in Chingford, added: ‘It will turn into a mini Calais. This is not the way we live, it’s inhumane and unhealthy.’ At least one local said the migrants ‘seem to keep their area quite clean’. However, Enfield police claim there is evidence that members of the public have been harassed and intimidated by the men, who occupy three separate camp areas.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Healy said anti-social behaviour is a ‘significant and persistent problem’ on the site. He said they have enlisted the help of two Romanian officers to work out why migrants were flocking to Edmonton and to help prevent other such sites from being developed.

TfL has vowed that the group will be issued with a date next week for a new court eviction hearing.’
