The care worker broke two vertebrae in her spine after leaping 10ft from a bathroom window to escape a schizophrenic who was threatening to kill her

A care worker broke her spine after jumping from a bathroom window to escape a sex pest schizophrenic who was threatening to kill her, a court heard.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was forced into the bathroom after Craig Cantwell, who has learning difficulties, asked for paracetamol to ease a headache.

The care worker, who was the only member of staff working at the Birkenhead home on the evening of July 8, took Cantwell upstairs to the medication room.

Once inside the medication room, the 29-year-old schizophrenic locked the door behind them, trapping the care worker inside.

He pushed the woman into the drugs cabinet and told her to go into the adjoining bathroom, adding: 'You will be safer in the bathroom because if you stay in here I will kill you.'

Cantwell, who had stacked items against the door of the room trapping them inside, grabbed hold of the care worker demanding she bend over before pointing at his groin and telling her he was aroused.

Cantwell denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence but was convicted after a four-day trial.

Prosecutor Anya Horwood told Liverpool Crown Court, the terrified woman locked herself in the bathroom.

She managed to call her manager but the phone rang out as Cantwell yelled at her through the door, threatening to kill her, smashing a hole in the wall.

The care worker leapt 10ft from the window breaking two vertebrae in her spine and injuring her heel.

But despite her broken back she managed to get to the road and shout for help.

Two milkmen, out on their early morning rounds, helped her into their van to keep her safe.

Cantwell appeared wielding a metal pole, telling the milkmen 'Don't mess with me, I'm from Manchester'.

One of the men, Edward Pike, stood in his way prompting Cantwell to hit the back of the van and a nearby car, snapping the pole in two.

He disappeared but returned holding a piece of wood in each hand. Mr Pike walked towards him and Cantwell backed off.

At his trial, Cantwell denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence.

He was convicted by a jury of seven women and five men after four days of evidence.

When police detained Cantwell after the 25-minute attack, he said he believed they were arresting him for trying to help the woman when she suffered an asthma attack.

He told officers he had drunk two or three cans of lager and thought he might have taken sleeping tablets.

He told the court he hit the plasterboard wall because the woman was having an asthma attack and said he had flicked her to the head accidentally. He claimed he grabbed the metal pole and pieces of wood in self-defence.

Remanding Cantwell in custody while psychiatric reports are prepared, Judge Conrad said he when the case reconvenes for sentencing he will be passing comment on the way the care home was run.

He told the court: 'There is evidence she should not have been put in the position she was.'
