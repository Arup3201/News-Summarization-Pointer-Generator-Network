It became as certain as death and taxes that England's finest would be embarrassed, dismantled and have their backsides handed to them on a silver platter in Europe this week. 

But the race to find a place at European football's top table back at home continues. Just once in the Barclays Premier League's 22-year history has it been as tight between third and seventh by February 28, and not even Arsene Wenger – the top four guru himself – can call this one.

Five clubs. Two places. Arsenal, Manchester United, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are on 48, 47, 46, 45 and 44 points respectively and, like Bruce Forsyth preached on Play Your Cards Right, it’s points that make prizes.

And Arsenal are silently racking them up. Finishing in the top four has, in some cruel corners, been labelled The Wenger Trophy. 

Yet true to form they have crept to third while the rest scrap among themselves. Arsenal last finished outside the top four in 1996 and, if the remaining 12 fixtures in the Premier League are anything to go by, then Wenger can expect same old, same old.

On paper they have the easiest run-in, if there is such a thing.

Arsenal have to play just three of the seven teams at the top of the Premier League, while Manchester United face five. It could spell make or break for those two when, on May 16, they meet for the penultimate weekend of the season at Old Trafford.

Manchester United have their work cut out for them if they are to qualify for the Champions League, as they face five of the current top seven before the season's end on May 24.

Yet Southampton – the club that were priced at 6/1 pre-season to be relegated, having lost Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Rickie Lambert, chairman Nicola Cortese and manager Mauricio Pochettino – will want to have a say.

Four years ago this very weekend, Southampton were scrapping in League One, losing 1-0 against Walsall in front of a 4,684 attendance. From the third tier to the first; from Bovril to champagne; from Walsall to, just maybe, Barcelona, Madrid, Munich, Paris?

They have never finished in the top four of the Premier League, but last did so in Division One in 1984. Arsenal, meanwhile, did so last year, as did Liverpool. Manchester United two years ago, and Tottenham three.

Southampton need only to maintain the momentum that kept them inside the top four for 18 weeks this season – more than Manchester United (15), Arsenal (5), Tottenham (1) and Liverpool (1).

Ronald Koeman’s team are the romantic option to be among Europe’s elite. Yet in February they lost against Liverpool, were held by West Ham, beaten by Swansea City and can’t ride on the coattails of their early-season form for much longer.

Form comes as easily as it goes. Liverpool – unbeaten in 10 Premier League matches – are a vastly different prospect to the team that surrendered at the Bernabeu on November 4.

It took them five years to return to the most prestigious European stage, only to end in a 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid and a 2-1 loss against Chelsea in the Premier League four days later. 

It took cojones from Brendan Rodgers to field a weakened team against Cristiano Ronaldo et al, and the ends did not justify the means. 

Yet a miniature head-to-head table between the five clubs chasing Champions League qualification, shown below, puts Liverpool (13 points) ahead of Manchester United (10), Tottenham (8), Southampton (6), and Arsenal (5).

And it’s not the first time they’ve been in a tight corner. The only other occasion the gap between third and seventh was so close was in February 2001.

Gerard Houllier’s Liverpool in third were just three points from Leicester City in seventh. 

Yet even then, they were two games clear of the clubs around them, having been pre-occupied between February 15 and 25 by the FA Cup fifth round, two UEFA Cup fourth round legs, and the League Cup final.

Liverpool won all three of those tournaments as Houllier delivered the treble, and a baby-faced, shaven-headed Steven Gerrard was crowned PFA Young Player of the Year.

They finished third, going to show the distractions of other competitions and a daunting fixture list doesn’t always shatter domestic form.

Fourteen years on, the Liverpool captain may settle for fourth and a few tears on his farewell for LA, whether that is at Stoke on May 24 or Wembley in the FA Cup final on May 30.

But their old nemesis Manchester United could, potentially, ruin both.

Louis van Gaal's team are live on television six times before the end of April – more than Liverpool (5), Arsenal (4), Tottenham (4) and Southampton (2) – but that could suit those more inclined to schadenfreude.

They're fourth, but have been winning ugly, and most supporters sensed their 2-1 defeat by Swansea  last week was coming.

With games against Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal before the curtain comes down in May, their fate is in their own hands.

Gary Neville is 'concerned', Paul Scholes deems them 'miserable', but again, points make prizes, no matter how you get them.

If only those at White Hart Lane could have even a smidgen of the same consistency.

Tottenham, led by a manager that abandoned St Mary’s in favour of a more likely European candidate in north London, have been hard done by when it comes to the top four.

They qualified in 2010, reaching the quarter-finals against Real Madrid, before the heartbreak of 2012. Chelsea were crowned European champions that year, meaning Tottenham missed out on Champions League football. In 2013, too, they missed out by a single point to north London rivals Arsenal. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, can become a familiar feeling.

They can beat Chelsea 5-3 yet lose 2-1 against Stoke. See off Arsenal 2-1 but crumble 2-1 at Crystal Palace. There or thereabouts; almost, but not quite; inconsistent.  

Pochettino's Tottenham remain in the running for Champions League qualification but can be inconsistent

None of the five sides going for those two spots have European distractions now, with Liverpool and Spurs exiting the Europa League on Thursday. There is always next year to try again, and the race goes on domestically.

So, come May 24, there is the guarantee that each of Wenger, Van Gaal, Koeman, Rodgers and Pochettino will either be reflecting on a job well done, or cursing what-ifs and maybes.

For now, with four points between them and 12 weeks remaining, no amount of statistics can determine what order it will finish, no matter how hard we try. It’s open season and the chase is on.
