Ed Miliband’s position is made easier by the fact that none of his potential rivals has declared their hand.

Many MPs want Alan Johnson, the popular former postman, to throw his hat into the ring – saying he has much greater appeal with voters than the awkward Mr Miliband.

But Mr Johnson, who served as Home Secretary under Gordon Brown, has all but ruled himself out, claiming last month that he had ‘no appetite for being on the frontbench’.

Next in line? Andy Burnham, left, has union backing, and Yvette Cooper, right, is the bookies' favourite

His refusal to put himself forward will force any plotters to look elsewhere.

It seems the succession would come down to a face-off between shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary.

The bookies are increasingly throwing their weight behind Mr Burnham, who made a well-received speech on the NHS at September’s Labour conference – in marked contrast to Mr Miliband’s famously poor effort.

It is reported that, emboldened by his conference success, he is already canvassing support; particularly in the North West.

Ladbrokes yesterday cut Mr Burnham’s chances of leading the party from 6/1 into 4/1 to be the next party leader, as more and more political punters back him.

The former health secretary has also gained the support of militant union leader Len McCluskey who said last month Mr Burnham is the person who ‘most impresses’ him on the Labour frontbench.

However, Miss Cooper is still favourite to take over if Mr Miliband goes; attracting odds of 7/2.

She can at least count on the support of her husband, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who is unlikely to have much chance of victory on his own.

Mr Johnson is further down the betting pecking order on 12/1.

If none of these decide to stand, it could be left to younger frontbenchers such as Chuka Umunna (8/1), with Rachel Reeves and Tristram Hunt outside bets on 16/1.

The man who Labour MPs and party members wanted to be leader – David Miliband – has odds of 20/1. But there is no chance of him taking the reins from his brother because he has stepped down as an MP and moved to the US.

... But the rules mean that it's impossible

Party rules say that to force out the leader, a vote of no-confidence has to be called – and the only way for that to happen is a card vote at the party’s annual conference.

No such move was made at the last Labour conference six weeks ago in Manchester and none is scheduled before May’s election.

So it seems that those dissatisfied with Ed Miliband’s leadership have missed their chance to force him out. Their only hope is that the pressure becomes so intolerable that he decides to step down for the good of the party. This could happen if, for example, a large number of MPs say publicly they want him to go. In that case, other candidates would be able to put themselves forward.

To become a candidate, an MP needs the support of 15 per cent of the parliamentary party – or 39 of Labour’s current 257 MPs.

The voting rules in a leadership contest were changed in March to a one member, one vote system for MPs, MEPs, party members and affiliated union members.
