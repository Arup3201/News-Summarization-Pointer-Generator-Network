A day later their mother Sihka and stepfather Manoj Ajitkumar Patel were also found in similar circumstances at their apartment in nearby Lokhandwala.

It has been reported that daughter Bharti had been sexually assaulted by her boss, which had driven her to take her own life.

Each of them filmed a suicide notes on a mobile phone before their deaths, which was found near the mother's body.

Now it has emerged that the family practiced exactly how they were going to hang themselves and also rehearsed what they were going to say in their last messages.

Police are now trying to establish exactly what happened to the family in the five days after filming the messages and prior to their deaths.

It was also revealed that the living room of the flat where the mother and stepfather were found had been emptied of furniture.

An officer told the news website: 'The kitchen has a fridge, which was also empty.

Police also made the bizarre discovery of 50,000 rupees (£520) stuffed in a container with a note saying the money was for officers.
