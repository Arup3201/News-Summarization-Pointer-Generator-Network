A female bodybuilder and model has filed a lawsuit against a high-powered Wall Street executive, accusing him of viciously beating her in a drunken rage after she had refused to drive him home.

Sahara Walsh, a 29-year-old self-described ‘body model’ from New York City, claims in her $100,000 suit that just before 4am on April 28, 46-year-old Quintano Downes jumped into the back of the car parked along Lenox Avenue carrying an open plate of food and demanded that she take him home.

When Walsh refused, Downes allegedly 'started to punch [her] with a closed first, dragged her out of the car by her hair and continued to stomp [her.]'

She said, he said: Model and bodybuilder Sahara Walsh (left), is suing Wall Street executive Quintano Downes (right) for $100,000 accusing him of attacking her in April - but he claims that he was the victim 

Walsh's attorney, Edgar De Leon, told the New York Post that the woman did not know her assailant personally, but the two have a mutual friend who was present during the attack.

The lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court Tuesday goes on to describe in detail how Downes, a director at the financial firm Kipling Jones & Co., then 'ripped her blouse off exposing her breast to the public and continued to drag [her] causing her to lose her shoes.'

A witness told the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office that Downes was seen pummeling the face of the muscular, curvaceous beauty with a closed fist and kicked her.

The night-time assault has left the model bleeding from cuts to her face, legs and arms, her lawsuit states.

'This hedge fund guy is pretty intoxicated, when they tell him to get out of the car he just turned on Walsh, pulled her out of the car and continued hitting her until the police responded,' De Leon told the paper. 

Walsh, a former Equinox fitness trainer who takes part in bodybuilding contests, is suing Downes for $100,000, claiming that her physical injuries, including a clump of hair ripped from her scalp, have caused her to lose modelling jobs.

Walsh's mother, Lynn Walsh, told the New York Daily News that her daughter and a female friend were sitting in a car in front of the model's apartment building in Harlem when Downes ambushed her.

‘His reaction was way over the top. It was irrational,’ she said. ‘He's an ex-Marine. She is a fitness expert but she weighs 98 pounds. He really had to take a 98-pound girl and mop the sidewalk with her?’

Following the altercation, Mr Downes has set out towards his home, but was quickly apprehended after a witness called 911.

Downes has dismissed Walsh's claims as lies. His attorney, Bruce Roistacher, told the Post that it was Walsh's friend who attacked him, and he was merely acting in self-defense. 

The 46-year-old executive and married father of two is due back in court in August on charges of harassment and assault.

Businessman: Downes is in the process of opening a European-style frozen yogurt business called Pa-Paya seed on Lenox Avenue in Harlem

Downes, who describes himself on his Twitter account as 'Son, Father, Husband, Brother, Uncle, Strong Black Man!!!' bought a renovated brownstone in Harlem for $1.95million last year, according to a New York Times article.

He is currently in the process of opening a European-style frozen yogurt business called Pa-Paya seed on Lenox Avenue between 118th and 119th streets.
