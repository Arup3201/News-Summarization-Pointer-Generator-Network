The number of NHS managers who were paid  more than £300,000 a year has doubled in just 12 months, according to a report.

The highly-paid executives, who often worked on an interim basis, were hired by struggling health trusts which paid them hefty salaries worth more than the Prime Minister’s wage of £142,500. 

A report by The Telegraph found that during 2013-14, 44 temporary executives were paid a staggering £1,000 a day — the equivalent of £228,000 a year.

Struggling: Earlier this month, officials said there have been more emergency admissions to hospitals than ever before

However, the large payouts have been widely criticized by patients groups, especially as junior staff have been unable to secure a one per cent pay rise.

According to the report, in 2013/2014 a further 22 executives received salaries of at least £300,000 a year. This salary was usually paid through an agency  which allowed it a share of the money.

Yet, NHS Trusts have suggested that it is vitally important to offer executives high salaries to attract the right kind of employee, particularly at short notice.

The report also uncovered evidence that some managers stayed in their role for more than a year, taking home exorbitant salaries.

The most highly paid NHS executives included -  Michael Morgan, chief executive of Rotherham Foundation Trust. He was paid the equivalent of £621,000 a year.

But many of the NHS hospital trusts who shelled out large sums to executives are facing problems  with patient care.

Last month, Colchester Hospitals foundation trust advised patients to keep away from A & E unless their condition was 'life-threatening.' 

Response time: There could be a move to  double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients

But it took on two temporary executives, Kim Hodgson and Evelyn Barker, on rates of £387,000 a year.

Earlier this month, The Mail on Sunday uncovered a secret plan to double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients.

The current target is for an emergency vehicle to reach those in life-threatening situations within eight minutes.

But a document seen by the newspaper revealed that the target time to get to those suffering a range of serious problems including strokes and seizures is to be increased to 19 minutes. 

Hospitals in England are admitting a record number of patients and say the service is being permanently run at a crisis level because pressures on A&E services 'continue to increase.' 

Earlier this month, there were 111,062 emergency admissions - the highest figure in more than a decade since records for emergency admissions began.
