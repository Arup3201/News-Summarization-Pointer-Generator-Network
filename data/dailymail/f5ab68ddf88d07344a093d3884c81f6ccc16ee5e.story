Julie Griffiths has been accused of breaching her order for a third time

A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for shouting at her own husband so loudly it kept her neighbours awake is being hauled back before a court for a third time - for laying into her partner's hygiene.

Julie Griffiths, 45, is accused of breaking the terms of her order and will answer to magistrates on April 14, just two weeks after she was was fined for berating Norman Griffiths, 64, for buying the wrong type of scratch card.

As this would be her third time breaking the conditions of her Asbo, which bans her from making noises loud enough to disturb neighbours of her terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire, the warehouse worker could face up to 26 weeks in jail.

In a recording of the latest rant, obtained by The Sun, Mrs Griffiths can be heard shouting: 'Give the bath a clean. Why should I have to do it? I drew a bath for you.

'Get that Cillit and give the bath a clean. No, not that one... Get the door shut... Shut the door... I keep saying, shut the door... you have to shut the door... Come out and shut that door... For God’s sake what you doing?'

The tirade did not stop there, however. Popping outside for a cigarette, she continued to yell back into the house: 'You mind if I have a bath once a week... because you’ve got no hygiene sense. I have a bath every day. I said you’re washed then? There’s no water running.'

Mrs Griffiths appeared before North Staffordshire Justice Centre on Tuesday and was ordered to pay £270 after a blistering 45-minute rant at her husband for buying the wrong type of scratch card.

Neighbours have been complaining about her outbursts since 1999, and it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo in December 2012. She was also dragged into court after a noisy argument last year.

Night-shift worker Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting.

The ruling prohibits her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours.

But she breached it just four months later it was imposed when she argued with Norman last April.

Alan Dawson, defending her at her court appearance earlier this week, said: 'The circumstances are that Julie Griffiths lives in a terrace with her husband of 25 years.

Unlucky neighbours: People have been complaining about the noise Griffiths made since 1999

'She has an Asbo but during this day in particular, there is an argument at the address and it’s as simple as that.

'There is no intention by this lady to encroach on the neighbours, she confined the argument to the house, she was not out on the streets, but the neighbours could hear it.

'Her husband said he slammed the door when he left the room and that was not her. Griffiths admitted the offence and accepts what she has done.

'She has lived at the address for 26 years and it is only quite recently that these issues have been reported. This is a lady who wants to get on with her life and keep herself to herself, but there is going to be some escape of noise in relation to her neighbours.'

Magistrates told Griffiths that breaching an Asbo was a serious offence but agreed to be lenient on this occasion.

She was fined £165 and ordered to pay £105 in court costs. She must also attend anger management classes.

Griffiths, who was escorted from court by two police officers, refused to comment after the hearing.

Julie Griffiths's rants will be nothing new to her long-suffering neighbours, who have been complaining about her for more than a decade.

She was first given a noise abatement order in 1999, and was fined £500 for a breach which was recorded in 2010.

Over the next two years the situation became especially dire, and the local council eventually installed noise monitoring equipment in 2012. Between July and October of that year, Griffiths breached her noise abatement order an incredible 47 times.

Neighbours revealed that she has been banned from family events thanks to her short temper.

After receiving her Asbo in December 2012, it was just four months until she was back in court for breaching the order. She was then fined £750 and ordered to pay costs of £85.

Irate neighbours eventually revealed the contents of her furious rants, in which she orders the long-suffering Norman Griffiths out of the house.

In
 one from the morning of August 27 2012, she can be heard shouting: 'Get 
out if you want a fag. Go! You’re not smoking in bed, I said get out if 
you want a fag! Get out if you want a fag! Get your shoes on and get out
 if you want a fag. Now get out.’

Griffiths then continues her 
rant, screeching: ‘Not gone yet, can’t hear the door, get your shoes on 
and get out, otherwise you’ll know about it. Get out, Do I have to say it
 again.’

In another she tell her husband: 'Don't worry Norman, I'm just about sick of you!'

Further clips show she is aware of being recorded, but continues regardless.

She says: 'Stop ignoring me, you are. I am being recorded by them next door now thanks to you.''They are recording every day. Because of you  I keep f*****g up.'
