a hate crime and committing a hate crime

U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves set sentencing for June 8 and ordered all three to be held in custody. The three are from the town of Brandon, a Jackson suburb, and were accused of going to the majority-black capital city on numerous occasions to harass or assault black people.

Prosecutor Sheldon Beer read the allegations against the three, saying they harassed or assaulted black people who they thought were homeless or intoxicated. Victims were chosen because they thought they would not tell police, authorities said.

Victim: James Craig Anderson, 47, was beaten and run over to death after Dedmon, Rice and Butler found him outside a hotel last June

The harassment began in April 2011, culminating in the death of James Craig Anderson, a 47-year-old car plant worker, on June 26.

Each was charged with the same two crimes. They face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and up to life on the hate crime charge.

Butler and Rice were accused of driving around Jackson and throwing beer bottles at people before meeting up with Dedmon the night Mr Anderson was run over.

Planned attacks: Prosecutors stated the men's harassment against blacks began on April 2011, leading to the death of Mr Anderson, the brother of Barbara Anderson Young, who delivered her statement before the court

Sheldon said there were other occasions when one or all of the defendants threw beer bottles and used a slingshot to shoot marbles at black people. In addition, Dedmon and Rice were accused of beating at least two other black men on different occasions.

Several people wept in court during the hearing.

Mr Anderson who was gay with a partner of 17 years, was not believed to have been attacked because of his sexuality according to Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which could have posed a separate hate crime.

His long-time partner James Bradfield
was not permitted to file as a plaintiff with the victim's family, 
however.

According to Mr Dees, 'under Mississippi law, same-sex partners have no claim
in civil actions like this,' he told Your Black World.

None of the defendants made statements during the hearing, speaking only briefly to answer questions from Reeves.

The victim's family had no comment.

Motive: Dedmon admitted he and a group of white teens were partying outside Jackson when he suggested they find a black man to harass leading to their find of Mr Anderson

Building: The group of men drove around Jackson on several occasions prior looking for African Americans to assault by throwing objects or becoming physical with them

Thomas E. Perez, the assistant attorney general for the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division, said: 'This is really a case about a group of racist thugs who made a sport of targeting vulnerable African Americans in Jackson and attacking them without provocation simply because of the color of their skin.'

'On a number of occasions they drove around Jackson looking for African Americans to assault,' Mr Perez said during a news conference after the hearing.

'Jackson is a wonderful community, however, for these defendants they referred to Jackson as 'Jafrica.' African Americans in Jackson were subhuman to them,' he said.

Reaction: Dedmon's family, pictured in court, cried during his sentencing while they heard the night's recounts of the 19-year-old beating and driving his vehicle over the group's victim

Ongoing: Police and FBI say their investigation in the killing and hate crime is ongoing and there could be more arrests

In entering his guilty plea to the state charges on Wednesday, Dedmon admitted he and a group of white teens were partying in Puckett, a small town outside Jackson, when he suggested they find a black man to harass. They found Mr Anderson before dawn outside a hotel.

Dedmon, 19, received two life sentences on those charges.

On the night of the killing, Rice and Butler and others stalled Mr Anderson until Dedmon arrived, according to allegations read in court. When Dedmon arrived, Rice punched Mr Anderson and knocked him down. Dedmon straddled the man and beat him.

According to a motel security guard, one of the teens went back to their vehicle after beating Mr Anderson while throwing his fist in the air shouting: 'white power!'

Sentences: Rice, seen at his high school graduation, faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and up to life on the hate crime charge

The case received widespread attention after a video of Mr Anderson's death was obtained by news organizations.

The video, taken by a hotel surveillance camera, shows Rice and Butler and others in a white Jeep Cherokee leaving a hotel parking lot at 5:05 a.m. Less than 20 seconds later, Dedmon's green Ford F-250 backs up and then lunges forward. Mr Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb.

Police said Dedmon was driving the truck that also held two teenage girls, reconvening with the rest of the group after at a local McDonald's.

There Dedmon bragged to the others: 'I ran that n***** over!' according to a witness.

Forgiveness: Reading a letter before Mr Anderson's family, Dedmon asked them for forgiveness saying he is a changed man

'The actions of these defendants who have pled guilty today in this court do not represent the values of Mississippi in 2012. This is an absolute tragedy, and what this family has had to go through as a result of the actions of these young men is inexcusable,' U.S. Attorney John Dowdy said.

Dan McMullen, special FBI agent in charge of Mississippi, said the agency is still investigating, but he declined to give details because the investigation is ongoing.

Dedmon was initially indicted on state charges for capital murder, which in Mississippi carries a sentence of death or life in prison without parole, but District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith said prosecutors couldn't have gotten a conviction. 

Life sentences: With Dedmon's guilty plea to murder and committing a hate crime, he received two concurrent life sentences

For capital murder, there must be an underlying offense, which had been robbery. Mr Smith said the investigation revealed that the group did not take Mr Anderson's wallet, as investigators first believed.

The family of Mr Anderson previously wrote to prosecutors asking the death penalty not be used against his attackers writing that it goes against their religion.

'We also oppose the death penalty because it historically has been used in Mississippi and the South primarily against people of color for killing whites,' the letter obtained by CNN to prosecutors read.

'Executing James’ killers will not help to balance the scales. But sparing them may help to spark a dialogue that one day will lead to the elimination of capital punishment.'

During the state court hearing Wednesday, Dedmon asked the victim's family for forgiveness.'

'As I stand before you today, I am a changed man. I am a godly man. God has showed me to see no colors. God showed me that we are all made in the image of God so we are all based on the same thing,' he said. 'I do not ask y'all to forget, but I do ask y'all to forgive.'

Rice is charged by the state with simple assault in the case. Rice has pleaded not guilty in that case.
