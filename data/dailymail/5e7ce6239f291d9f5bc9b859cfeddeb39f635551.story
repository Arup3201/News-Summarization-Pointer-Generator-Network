Capturing artistic photographs used to require some serious kit - a dedicated camera complete with an array of state-of-the art lenses.

But these winning entries in the mobile phone category for the Sony World Photography Awards prove that the best camera is the one in your pocket.

More than 10,000 people submitted   phone images this year after the category was introduced for the first time to recognise how mobile technology has revolutionised the way we record and document our lives.

The competition was open to photographers of all abilities and it was judged on a single image taken using any mobile phone camera. 

Turi Calafato, from Italy, was awarded first prize for his 'Untitled' shot of two people snoozing on a beach and Janos M Schmidt's evocative photograph of sunset at Nyugati railway station in Budapest came in second place.
