Students from Sydney and London have developed an amphibious prosthetic limb that lets wearers run on sand and swim full speed in the sea.

The Murr-ma limb has a split-toe design that helps a user balance on the uneven terrain of a beach and has studs that give a larger surface area when running on soft sand.

When worn in water, Murr-ma has 'fins' fitted at the top of the prosthesis that channel the flow of water along the limb and propels the swimmer faster - and this can give wearers more thrust and faster speeds than able-bodied people.Â

Students from Sydney and London have developed an amphibious prosthetic limb that lets wearers run quickly on sand due to its split-toe design. The limb also comes with 'fins' that mean the wearer can transition to swimming easily

The split-toe foot with studs provide a larger surface area that improves balance on soft and uneven terrains.

The split-toe also reduces the amount of drag in water.

It has a carbon-fibre backbone that 
supports the wearer's body weight but is flexible and creates energy 
during running and walking.

Fins along the front of the 
prosthesis give thrust when kicking and channel water past the 
foot to streamline movement in water.

The team behind Murr-ma wanted to create a prosthesis specifically designed for high-performance water sports and beach activities such as surfing and beach volleyball.

Pairs of fins along the front of the prosthesis give thrust when kicking.

They also channel water past the foot to streamline the movement and reduce underwater drag.

Murr-ma, right, is made of carbon fibre and has fins that give thrust when kicking. These fins, inspired by the fins on a sailfish, also channel water past the foot in water to give wearer's 'superhuman' speed.

Murr-ma lets the wearer seamlessly switch from running on the beach to swimming at full speed

The fins of the Murr-ma were inspired by the dorsal fin of the sailfish, which is capable of swimming 100 metres in under five seconds.

The split-toe also reduces the amount of drag in water.

Because of its design and the material it is made for, the limb lets the wearer go seamlessly from running on the beach to swimming at full speed.

The makers even claim that this specialised design could make wearers swim faster than able-bodied people.

In a demonstration video, one of the developers claims he wanted to give the wearer a 'superpower' with the design of Murr-ma.

The limb has been made to be lightweight and durable and could also be used daily on other terrains and during other sports.

According to the Murr-ma website, the design is just a prototype and there are no immediate plans to sell it commercially.
