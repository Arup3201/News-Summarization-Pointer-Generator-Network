Moving on: Josh Elliot is quitting GMA to join NBC Sports

Josh Elliott has been removed entirely from the GMA website - just a day after quitting for rival network NBC.

The 42-year-old broadcaster left his role on GMA for a $4million deal with NBC Sports on Sunday.

And now there is no trace of the news star, who helped GMA take the ratings crown from NBC's Today Show.

He has been removed from the GMA website, and all videos and promos featuring him have been taken down.

An ABC source confirmed to MailOnline today: 'It's not unusual that GMA, just like any other show, rejig promos when there's some kind of departure.

'It's standard procedure.'

Josh was actually offered $5million-a-year from ABC - but turned it down as he believed there was a brighter future for him at NBC.

Another source said: 'ABC really thought that Josh was a total ingrate and that he just dragged out the negotiation.

'But he's gone now and while he's got a couple of weeks left on his contract he won't be working anywhere.'

While Sam Champion got a teary send-off when he left for The Weather Channel in December, Josh was 'on vacation' when his departure was announced to GMA viewers on Monday morning.

His exit was revealed as ABC's Amy Robach was announced as his replacement.

George Stephanopoulos congratulated Robach on her promotion at the top of Monday morning's show and briefly touched on Josh, saying: 'He is going back to his roots, reporting on the NFL and the Olympics on NBC Sports.

'He let us know last night, and, Josh, it has been a great run with you here on GMA. We're very happy you're going to be pursuing your passion.'

Josh's departure now leaves George as the only male co-host on GMA, something co-anchor Lara Spencer joked about when she said 'The estrogen is flowing.'

Sources say that ABC chiefs are now looking for a new male co-host to join the team.

Rumours, rumours: GMA co-hosts Lara Spencer and Amy Robach are now keen to quell any reports they don't get along - and today tweeted a picture of themselves with their 'claws' out

Lara, 44, who last week signed a 
$2million-a-year-deal to stay on GMA, and Amy, 41, who is currently 
undergoing treatment for breast cancer, have already made a clear bid to
 quell a groundswell of rumours they do not get along in the slightest.

Both today tweeted a picture of them holding up their 'claws' after having a manicure while wearing GMA crowns.

After weeks of negotiations with ABC, Josh will anchor NBC's highest-profile sports including Sunday Night Football, the Olympics and Triple Crown Racing.

Josh battled to get a huge bump in his salary after his popular co-star Robin Roberts signed a deal believed to be worth $14million.

A source said: 'Josh knew that he wasn't going to get that amount - but what he wanted was an increase that was proportionate to Robin's boost.'

Josh's move to NBC means that he will be well lined up for the anchor role on the Today Show when Matt Lauer eventually leaves.

Matt's $25million contract is up later this year and while he may sign an extension to his contract - he may well depart within the next year or two, leaving the job wide open for Josh, according to TV sources.

However, Josh has a six-month 'non-compete' clause with Today Show, so he can't be on the air anytime soon.

Another source said that while Josh could also be in line for Bob Costas's job, he was 'an addition' to NBC Sports - NOT a replacement.

One source told MailOnline: 'While 
the clear lead anchors on the Today Show are Matt Lauer and Savannah 
Guthrie, on GMA, Josh shared duties with Robin, Lara and George 
Stephanopoulos and they all pull their own weight together.

'Therefore, it was totally right he should ask for a raise equal in measure to Robin's.'.

It was reported that Josh was reportedly
 demanding more than $8 million a year — a whopping increase over his 
current annual salary of around $1 million.

He leaves as ABC news boss Ben Sherwood takes over as chairman of Disney/ABC TV group.

And in a memo, Mr Sherwood wrote: 'Jvosh Elliott let us know today that he is going to NBC Sports. As many of you know, we have been negotiating with Josh these past several months. In good faith, we worked hard to close a significant gap between our generous offer and his expectations. In the end, Josh felt he deserved a different deal and so he chose a new path.

'We worked hard to close a significant gap between our generous offer and his expectations.

'I want to thank Josh for his many contributions to GMA and ABC News. Later in the week, we will bid him farewell. With Robin, George, Lara, Ginger and Amy, GMA's best days are ahead.'
