Jurors in the fraud trial of Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi's former personal assistants have today been told to 'ignore' David Cameron after he declared he was a secret fan of the chef.

The Prime Minister admitted in an interview that he is a member of 
#TeamNigella - which is used by those rooting for the Domestic Goddess in her very public battle 
with ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

Mr Cameron yesterday brushed aside her admission that she had
snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis, hailing her as a ‘very funny and 
warm person’ who creates good recipes.

But his comments led to him becoming embroiled in the ongoing trial at Isleworth Crown Court, with the judge saying the Prime Minister caused this morning's proceedings to be 'wasted'.

Backing: David Cameron has revealed he is supporting TV cook Nigella Lawson in her public battles with her husband, but a judge in her staff's fraud trial has criticised him for his comments

Thanks: Miss Lawson has used the hashtag #Team Nigella to thank her supporters, and offer a recipe for Holiday Hotcake

Justice Robin Johnson told jurors in 
the trial of Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo it was 'of regret' when 
public figures commented about someone involved in a trial and urged 
them to only decide the case based on the evidence in court.

Public criticism: Judge Robin Johnson today said that it was 'of regret' that David Cameron had commented on the row between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi

Elisabetta
Grillo, referred to as Lisa, 41, and sister Francesca, 35, of 
Bayswater, west London, each deny a single 
count of committing fraud by using a company credit card for personal 
gain between January 1, 2008, and December 31 last year.

The sisters are accused of abusing their positions by spending 
£685,000 on credit cards belonging to the celebrity couple to buy 
designer goods and luxury holidays for themselves.

The judge says their legal team claims the siblings are 'aggrieved' by Cameron's comments.

The problems have been sparked after the Primer Minister was asked by the Spectator if he was a member of #TeamNigella, and Mr Cameron admitted: ‘I am.’

He
went on: ‘I’m a massive fan, I’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her
a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm 
person.

‘But I’m also an 
amateur cook and I like her recipes. Nancy [Cameron’s nine-year-old 
daughter] and I sometimes watch a bit of Nigella on telly. Not in court,
I hasten to add.’

Judge Robin Johnson told jurors at Isleworth Crown Court the comments were 'regrettable' and directed the jury of seven men and five women to ignore the comments and to only focus on the evidence they have heard in open court.

He said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, the reason for delay is I have been taken to a large number of press reports.

'They centre on the Prime Minister commenting about a prosecution witness, Ms Lawson, during an interview with a journalist.

'It is of regret when people in public office comment about a person who is involved in a trial that is in progress.

'It is inconceivable that some of your number may not have seen some of those comments.

'The defendants feel aggrieved as a result of the comments, though they do not specifically deal with matters in this trial, are favourable to Ms Lawson.

'The fact that they may feel aggrieved, the defendants, is not without justification.

'You'll realise that what public figures may feel about this case or a witness in this case, can have no bearing on the issues that you have to decide.

'Please use the written direction I gave you.'

He directed jurors concentrate 'on the evidence, and submissions and the legal directions.

'All this material, you'll hear in this room and nowhere else.'

He added: 'Jurors are trusted to follow the judge's directions and I trust you'll do that.'

Apologising for wasting the court's morning on legal argument, he added: 'I'm sorry that it has had the effect of wasting almost all of the morning that should have been devoted to evidence and real issues in this case.'

It is not clear if Mr Cameron has 
taken Miss Lawson up on her offer on Twitter of the recipe for Holiday 
Hotcake, which she described as 'the perfect receip to show tanks for 
all your support and to those who hashtag #TeamNigella'.

Last
week, Ms Lawson admitted taking cocaine with ex-husband John Diamond 
when he found out he had terminal cancer, and on another occasion in 
July 2010 during her troubled marriage to Mr Saatchi.

The 53-year-old also admitted smoking cannabis in the last year of her marriage to the art gallery owner but said the idea that she is a 'drug addict or habitual user of cocaine is absolutely ridiculous'.

Giving evidence on the witness stand, Miss Lawson admitted to taking drugs in front of her children.

Ms Lawson spoke of suffering 'intimate terrorism' at the hands of her multi-millionaire ex-husband, describing him as a 'brilliant, but brutal man'.

She accused him of 'peddling' stories about her alleged drug habit, including that he was checking her nose for cocaine when he was photographed gripping her throat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London, in June.

Charles Saatchi earlier told the court he still ‘absolutely adores’ ex-wife Nigella Lawson, was ‘very upset’ over claims she took cocaine and denies ‘gripping, strangling or throttling’ her outside a restaurant.

Instead, in the infamous incident captured on camera – which led to the couple’s divorce – he claimed he was simply ‘holding her head, by the neck, to get her to focus’.

Miss Lawson, he revealed, was unhappy in their marriage because she felt she needed to ask him for a ‘pass’ to do what she wanted.

The trial continues.
