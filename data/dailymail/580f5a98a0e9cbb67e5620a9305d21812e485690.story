The iconic black bull that looms over roads across Spain - and is now its unofficial national symbol - could soon be coming to a street near you.

The brandy firm behind the legendary advert is planning to let its Toro Osborne out of the corral to roam main roads across Europe, Asia and the U.S.

It means the 14 metre high billboard - 
seen by millions of tourists to the Iberian peninsula each year - could 
soon be popping up on the streets of New York, London or Tokyo.

Dallas, in the U.S., and the Danish capital of Copenhagen have already stated a firm interest.

Looming: The Toro Osborne can be seen on roads across Spain, and could soon be coming to a city near you

A herd of 94 are currently dotted 
around the Iberian peninsula, the Canary Islands and most recently the 
Spanish North African enclave of Melilla.

Osborne PR director Iván Llanza spoke of the company's dream at the opening of its fourth Toro by Osborne shop in Salamanca.

He said he saw 'no reason' why the Toro could not stretch its legs across the world. He said he had already received requests from Dallas, in the U.S. and the Danish capital of Copenhagen.

But introduction of the bulls to England may spark protest, however, with many animal rights activists associating it with bullfighting.

But this, Llanza has previously protested, is not the case. He argues that the hoardings, which stand prominently on hillsides across Spain, are simply an advert for the company.

The Toro Osborne sprang up in the 1950s as Spain, recovering from the Civil War, started the rough and rocky road from poverty to the developed world.

While the classic rectangle boards were shooting up, Osborne, the Jerez based brandy firm, decided they wanted something a bit different.

huge brand, selling t-shirts (right), keyrings and other merchandise

And that was certainly what they got when marketing genius Manolo Prieto came up with the idea of a silhouetted billboard depicting one of the 'toros bravos' or 'brave bulls' used in bullfights - with the company's name emblazoned across its side.

In 1957 more than 50 were placed on hill tops across the country, alongside adverts for soap powders, American fizzy colas and kitchen appliances.

Location: There are 94 bulls in Spanish territories

The shadow they cast shortly became synonymous with Spain. It was ironic that Prieto, a  staunch communist, created a symbol which was taken up and used by the fascist right- wing Franco government.

The first batch of bulls were wooden, had white horns and stood four metres high. But the weather soon took its toll and four years later, in 1961, they were replaced with seven metre high sheet iron versions.

The Toros' first brush with the law came just a year later when two Francoist dictats ordered billboards be located at least 125 metres from main roads.

It seemed the Toros were being returned to their corrals, but to make sure they could be seen Osborne gave them some feeding pills and grew them to 14 metres tall.

By this time there were 90 toros across the country – all the way from Cantabria to Murcia – with the most in the Alicante province.

But their freedom was short-lived. Come the 1980s and Spain was embarking on a crash course to democracy - and the newly empowered Socialist government declared war on hoardings blotting the landscape.

As the eyesores started to be torn down, thousands launched a campaign to save the silhouettes from destruction. They argued they were a tourist attraction, despite the fact many had had their gonads and/or heads smashed off by vandals and anti-bullfight protestors.

Remarkably, in those pre-Facebook pressure days, President Felipe Gonzalez relented and decided the Toros Osborne, as they affectionately came to be known, could stay.

The one condition was the name of the company had to be removed from the bull‟s stomach. The firm agreed as its brand name was already associated with the Toros and the campaign had given them more inches of newspaper print across the world than they could ever have dreamt of.

Now, it is the symbol of the country across the world, donned proudly by Spaniards on their holidays - and even worn by tennis star Rafael Nadal when the football team won the World Cup in South Africa in 2010.

The company was founded in 1772 by an Englishman, the Exeter wine importer 
Thomas Osborne.
