The main victim, named locally as Ikram Elahi, died in hospital after suffering a single gunshot wound following a street battle over a mystery 'dispute' last night.

Three men in total were rushed to hospital after police were called to the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham at 7.30pm on Wednesday. Two of the men had been shot while the third suffered stab wounds.

Injured: A man covered in blood was helped by friends as he was hurt in the fighting involving hundreds of people last night

A spokesman for West Midlands Police confirmed an armed unit had been sent to the scene on the Stratford Road.

They have arrested a 'number of people' following the violence and many roads in the area remained cordoned off yesterday morning.

Local MP Roger Godsiff said today he is liaising with police and said there are 'plenty of people (in the area) who express concerns that particular properties are being used as drugs’ dens'.

Mariam Khan, councillor for Washwood Heath tweeted: 'RIP Ikram Elahi. The young man who passed away after getting shot this evening in Sparkbrook.

'A life lost over a dispute. Terrible news.'

A witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'I heard a gunshot and looked out of my window to see a man with his face covered running away from the scene wielding a bat.

'Another guy was walking away and his arm was completely shredded and there was a lot of blood.

'I could hear someone down the road screaming and shouting 'I've been shot' again and again.

'Police arrived and taped off the road but there were tons of people around.

'There was a huge crowd of young boys and they stayed for another couple of hours and kept making a commotion, but left at about 9.30pm.'

One shopkeeper, who did not want to give his name, said he had been locking up for the day, at about 7.20pm, when he saw a 'large group' had gathered.

'Then after that lots of police came down.

'Customers have told me it's a murder investigation but I don't know what it's about.'
