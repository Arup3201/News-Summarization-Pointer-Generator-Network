Liverpool are better off embracing the cauldron that is the Bernabeu rather than fearing a thumping, reasons Jamie Carragher. 

The Reds travelled to Madrid on Monday at their lowest ebb of the season after defeat by Newcastle at the weekend.

That result left Brendan Rodgers' side well off the pace set by Premier League leaders Chelsea - rendering the hard work put in last year almost inconsequential.

Jamie Carragher believes that Liverpool can go to Real Madrid and get something out of the game

They have struggled to impose themselves on the Champions League, losing 3-0 to Real Madrid at Anfield and 1-0 away in Basle. 

But, despite Carlo Ancelotti's Galacticos sporting a Cristiano Ronaldo in bewildering form, Carragher believes the tough ask could actually benefit his former side.

'There will be some trepidation because of what happened in the first game but the players need to try to relax and enjoy it,' Sportsmail's columnist told the Liverpool Echo.

Liverpool will rely on the pace of Raheem Sterling on the break at the Santiago Bernabeu 

'People don't expect Liverpool to get anything so the pressure is off a bit but you don't want to go there and get embarrassed.

'Of course Real Madrid are big favourites but it's not impossible for Liverpool to get something out of the game.'
