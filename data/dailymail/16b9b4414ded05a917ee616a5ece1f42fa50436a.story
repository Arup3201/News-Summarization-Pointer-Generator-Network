Fernando Alonso captained an F1 team against a 'Star XI' in a charity football match in Monaco on Tuesday night.

The star-studded teams were playing in the Star Team for Children annual game, set up by Prince Albert II 20 years ago.

Controversial: Claudio Ranieri was sacked by Monaco on Tuesday... but still turned up to manage a team

Tennis player Djokovic scored the first goal for his team, who went on to win the game 3-2.

Meanwhile, Claudio Ranieri turned up to coach the players on the same day he was sacked as manager by stadium owners Monaco.

Leonardo Jardim is the favourite to succeed the Italian, who was gracious in his appearance at the Stade Louis II ground.

Felipe Massa posted pictures on his Instagram account at the event, while Toro Rosso man Daniel Kvyat scored ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix.

The match is played every year in May, find out more by visiting www.starteamforthechildren.org.
