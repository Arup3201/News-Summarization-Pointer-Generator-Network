This is the moment a 'crazy' gun-wielding suspect held out his arms seconds before he was shot dead by LAPD officers.

Officers arrived on the scene and told the unnamed man to put the weapon down, but he refused.

It prompted a stand off where police shot him dead as he knelt down in the middle of Mateo Street in downtown Los Angeles.

Customers in a nearby restaurant said he was shooting into the air and tried to carjack someone moments before he was killed.

Carrie Kravetz was about to drive out of her garage when she saw the incident unfolding. She took a picture of the man in the middle of the road from just 15ft away.  She described how she reversed on police orders and then heard two gunshots seconds later.  

She told ABC 7: 'I felt like my life was at risk. And the security guard was like, "You need to back up," and it kind of like took me a second, and I backed up, and as I was backing up into my garage, I heard some gunshots - two gunshots.

'I was really scared. I've never been that close to a gun. Whatever the police did was what I'm sure they had to do because he was crazy.

'He could have injured tons and tons of people.' 

Sergeant Frank Precidao issued a statement saying: 'Officers responded to the location. They did observe a male with a handgun, and he was firing that gun.

The suspect was pronounced dead on the scene and an LAPD spokesman confirmed no officers were injured.
