He has promised to show his baby son, Prince George, the marvels of Africa one day.

And yesterday Prince William took his first step to safeguard the continent and its wildlife, launching a new project to halt the sickening global trade in illegal animal products.

Accompanied by his father, Prince Charles, an equally ardent conservationist, the second in line to the throne said he wanted to highlight the worrying increase in the trafficking of ivory and rhino horn as well as bush meat and live endangered species.

William shared a joke with his father Prince Charles while on a visit to London zoo to launch the new project aimed at protecting some of the world's most vulnerable animals

The new scheme aims to stop the trade in endangered animal products including rhino horns and ivory

The princes chose to launch their initiative in the uniquely appropriate surroundings of the new Tiger Territory at the world famous London Zoo.

The zoo has two Sumatran tigers, a five-year-old male called Jae Jae and his mate, Melati, five, big cats who face an uncertain future in the wild.

To combat their instinctive shyness, the keepers had left nothing to chance, leaving an offering of fresh horse meat and spraying their enclosures with perfume which, apparently, stimulates their scent marking instincts.

The scent of the day was Hugo Boss although the female, unsurprisingly, prefers Jo Malone, while the male rather likes Old Spice.

Keeper Teague Stubbington said: ‘We have kept back a little of their breakfast - horse meat today - in order to encourage them out of their enclosures.

‘This is quite normal and helps to stimulate their natural hunting behaviour. We will often hide it and make a game of finding it.

‘I have also been leaving a trail of perfume - Hugo Boss today. Tigers don’t hide away in the jungle, they like to advertise their presence.

‘Putting perfume down helps to stimulate their scent marking behaviour. Melati prefers Jo Malone and Jae Jae is partial to a bit of Old Spice.’

Describing them as ‘beautiful and majestic’ creatures, William couldn’t hide his passion for conservation as he launched his new United for Wildlife project.

United for Wildlife is an umbrella organisation, bringing together seven of the world’s biggest campaigners, including WWF-UK and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), in order to tackle global crises in conservation. William is president of the organisation.

The first issue for them is the trade in illegal wildlife products, which has exploded again in recent years.

According to research highlighted at the London Zoo briefing, just 60 African rhinos had been poached by the middle of the last decade - compared to 800 already so far this year. That number is expected to rise to 1,000 by the end of 2013.

Similarly out of the 423,000-strong African elephant population, 25,000 were slaughtered for their tusks last year.

The royals looked at new technologies are
being used to wage war on illegal wildlife poachers, from remote 
controlled drones to monitor animals to cameras that can be hidden in 
fake stones to capture images of the poachers and send them back 
remotely to local rangers.

The trade in rhino horn has boomed in recent years. While just 60 were poached in the middle of the last decade, 800 have been killed so far this year, along with 25,000 elephants slaughtered for their ivory

William spoke from the heart about his determination to get such experts in ‘one room to focus their energy and their commitment to one cause - particularly obviously this illegal wildlife trade at the moment is such a big issue’.

The charities uses technology such as remote drones and cameras hidden inside rocks to catch poachers. Here Prince William gets to grips with a toy segull

‘The idea was that United for Wildlife can progress and we can really start the ball rolling and the momentum and really try and change and tackle this issue,’ he said.

The prince, who said he hopes to travel to Kenya next year to further his work, went on: ‘Education is the most important thing as we saw with the shark fin soup campaign - the more education, the more obviously we can put out there and show people and educate them on what they’re buying and what they’re seeing and really try and change their attitudes.

‘I think we’ve got a real chance of changing the way things are going.

‘One of the aims is to identify just who is doing it. If they cannot be caught at the time, at least we have a picture of the guy so they can be prosecuted.’

Charles also said the need to reduce the markets for illegal animal products was a crucial issue.

He explained: ‘One of the most important things is helping the NGOs who struggle away, particularly organisations like Traffic (the wildlife trade monitoring network) and WildAid (anti-illegal wildlife trade body) and the World Wildlife Fund, of which I’m president in the UK.

‘They’re doing a fantastic job but they’re up against a huge series of obstacles.’

He added: ‘The most important thing to remember, I think, is that you have to reduce consumption of illegal wildlife parts, whether it’s ivory, or rhino horn, tiger parts, or whatever from various endangered species.’
