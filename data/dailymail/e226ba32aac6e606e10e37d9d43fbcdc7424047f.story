Emily Davison (1872 - 1913), a few days before her fatal attempt to stop the King's horse 'Amner' on Derby Day to draw attention to the Women's Suffragette movement

She is remembered as the suffragette who died under the King’s horse.

But it has always been unclear as to whether Emily Davison really did intend to kill herself at the Epsom Derby in 1913 – or whether she simply wanted to make a public stand.

Now new evidence has emerged to suggest the latter, after local historian Maureen Howes spent ten years working with the activist’s family to discover the truth.

Both she and Davison’s surviving 
relatives are convinced that it was nothing more than a tragic accident,
and are determined to set the record straight.

Davison died in hospital four days after being knocked down by George V’s horse, Anmer, at Tattenham Corner.

It
is a common theory that rather than seeking martyrdom, she had merely 
attempted to tie the Suffragette’s colours to the horse.

Mrs
Howes’ research suggests that it was only by coincidence that Davison 
had decided to do this – as earlier, safer, protest plans had been 
scuppered.

Her conclusions 
have been drawn after trawling through previously unseen mementoes, 
photographs and documents from family members, and listening to 
anecdotes.

She said: ‘At the
time of Emily’s death, the family found all the publicity too much. It 
was very unpleasant. They were reluctant to speak out.

‘The
story is so well-known but no-one has found out the truth. I’m happy 
with what I have written but I know it will upset a few apple carts.

The militant suffragette and martyr to the cause of the political advancement of women, had a favourite quotation: 'Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.'

‘People want to declare Emily as a suicidal fanatic but I have a very different version of the Epsom Derby.

‘She doesn’t deserve the legacy which has been given to her.’

According
to Mrs Howes, Davison resorted to running onto the track as a ‘plan B’ 
after an attempt to pin the colours to a horse in the paddock failed.

She said ‘plan A’, the safer option, was scuppered when Davison was recognised and barred from entering the pen.

She said: ‘She didn’t commit suicide. There’s no chance of it. It was just a tragic accident.

‘She put herself in a risky position, but it was a plan B.

‘She was meant to pin her colours to the horse in the paddock but they didn’t let her in.

‘It
was then decided to go for went for plan B - she probably thought, if 
we can’t do it in the paddock, let’s do it at Tattenham Corner where the
news reel is.’

Mrs Howes 
said it was well-known within the family, based in Morpeth, 
Northumberland, that Davison had practised pinning colours on horses in 
local fields before the event.

In
addition, it was only by chance that she was the person given the job 
of pinning the suffragette colours to the King’s horse on the fateful 
day.

Mrs Howes said the 
Morpeth Suffragettes drew straws during practice on Morpeth Common to 
decide who would pin the suffragette colours to the King’s horse, and 
Davison drew the short straw.

Davison
had also let it be known that she was intending to travel to Paris 
after the Epsom protest to help her sister, Letitia, care for her 
three-month-old baby son Josse.

And
it is already well-known that she had bought a return ticket to the 
Epsom Derby – with the stub still in her bag when she died.

Mrs
Howes, 74, a grandmother and widow, is publishing her first book on the
subject this week, titled Emily Wilding Davison: A Suffragette’s Family
Album.

It has been published to help mark the 100th anniversary of Davison’s death in June 1913.

She tracked down family members by using her genealogy skills and posting adverts in the local paper.

She said: ‘The family took me in as one of their own. They wanted to get their stories out before they get too old.

‘They wouldn’t trust anyone before they met me. I’m not political or academic, I just want to get the truth out.’

After
Davison’s death, the coroner recorded death by misadventure rather than
suicide – but it was widely thought that she had acted intentionally.

Many
openly criticised her in the media, with Queen Mary calling her a 
‘brutal lunatic woman’, while the Suffragettes proclaimed her a martyr 
to their cause.
