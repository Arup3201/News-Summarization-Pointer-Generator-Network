Tom Cleverley says he is enjoying his football again and is hoping to follow the example of former Manchester United team-mate Danny Welbeck. 

The pair left United in summer - Cleverley joining Aston Villa and Welbeck heading to Arsenal - after Louis van Gaal deemed them surplus to requirements.

But Cleverley believes both will now prove their worth now they are playing regularly.

'Leaving United is definitely not the end. We both came up through the academy and were living the dream at the team we grew up at,' Cleverley told The Telegraph. 'I wouldn't change it for the world, I've played in the Champions League, I've played for my country and won the league. 

'But United is not the be all and end all. I'm sure we're both happy to be on the pitch and playing 90 minutes every week. 

'Last year at times it wasn't enjoyable and you play your best football when you're enjoying yourself. I certainly am enjoying myself now, so hopefully that can show for Villa on the pitch.'

Cleverley also revealed that he missed Welbeck's Champions League hat-trick against Galatasaray because he was at the cinema watching Denzel Washingotn's new film The Equalizer.

The 25-year-old says he is not surprised his former team-mate is now proving his critics wrong and he hopes to follow suit after a torrid season with United. 

Cleverley took much of the flak from fans for United's poor performances under former manager David Moyes last season, but is looking forward now. 

He added: 'As a team, individually we weren't good enough last year. I'm not going to say I was a scapegoat because we all got criticism. That's not something I look back on. It has made me a stronger person. I am just looking forward now.

'Every footballer wants the best opportunity to play and I felt like it was here. I don't see this as a backward step at all. I see this as getting back to basics, playing every week and pushing on from here.'
