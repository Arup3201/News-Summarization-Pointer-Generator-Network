Only half of Americans see Christmas as a religious holiday these days, and plan to go to church, however a surprising three quarters say they believe in the virgin birth.

New findings by the Pew Research Center show nine in 10 Americans celebrate the holiday but many people view it as more of a cultural celebration steeped in traditions like gift giving and getting together with family rather than a time for religious reflection.

While about seven out of 10 Americans said they typically attended religious services to mark the holiday when they were children, only 54 per cent say they plan to attend Christmas services this year.

'There are significant generational differences in the way Americans plan to celebrate Christmas this year, with younger adults less likely than older adults to incorporate religious elements into their holiday celebrations,' the report states.

People aged 29 with be the least represented age group at mass, with only 46 per cent planning to go along, compared to 60 per cent of over 65s.

Women are also more inclined to go to church than men, 58 per cent compared to 50 per cent, and parents with children at home are more likely to attend a service than those whose kids have flown the nest.

Irrespective of their religious affiliations, Pew found nearly everyone gathers with family and friends on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and did so in childhood

While lower than in the past, the proportion of people who plan to go to church, 54 per cent, is significantly higher to the 36 per cent of people who attend services every Sunday.

About nine out of 10 adults who see Christmas as a religious holiday said they believe Jesus was born of a virgin.

Interestingly, however, even among those who celebrate Christmas as a cultural holiday and those who do not celebrate Christmas, roughly half said they believe in the virgin birth.

Irrespective of their religious affiliations, Pew found nearly everyone gathers with family and friends on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and did so in childhood.

'This type of gathering is common among all demographic and religious groups in the population,' the research states.

They also plan to buy gifts for their loved ones.

Around 80 per cent said they have put up a Christmas tree, slightly less than the number who said they had a fir when they were children, and the practice of sending Christmas or holiday cards and caroling has fallen out of fashion throughout the years.

Only 31 per cent of people said they would pretend Santa Claus will visit their home, compared to 72 per cent who said this was a tradition when they were younger.

The survey, conducted December 3-8, 2013, among 2,001 adults nationwide, found commercialization of Christmas was the most frustrating thing for American families.

One-third say they dislike the materialism of the holidays, one-fifth dislike the expenses associated with the season, and one-tenth dislike holiday shopping and the crowded malls and stores.
