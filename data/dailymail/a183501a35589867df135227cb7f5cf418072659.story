Doctors have removed what is believed to be the world’s largest tumour from a man’s leg – after it grew to more than 17 stone.

Yang Jianbin, 37, from Shanxi Province, China was born with a dark birthmark on the right side of his lower back – and noticed it getting larger when he was nine.

By the time he was 12, it had increased to the size of a fist and he had surgery to remove it.

Yang Jianbin goes under the knife at the hospital in Beijing. He first noticed his birthmark getting bigger at primary school when he was nine

But despite medical intervention, it started to grow again and a recent hospital check in Beijing revealed that the tumour had increased to an enormous 110kg – more than 17 stone.

Chief surgeon Chen Minliang said Yang suffered from Neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that affects the normal growth and development of cell tissue.

‘We have seen neurofibromatosis patients before, but this is the biggest nerve tumour we ever saw,’ he said.

The 37-year-old had surgery to remove the tumour when he was 12, but it started to grow rapidly again in recent years

Yang had said previously that the huge tumour was so big he could only lie down or sit on bed all day.

He was given two hospital beds to accommodate the 1.2m tumour, which made up two-thirds of his total body weight.

Removal surgery involved nine doctors and lasted 16 hours. During the procedure, the patient received 5,000ml of blood, which is more than the entire amount an adult's body holds.

But he is said to be recovering well and is expected to be discharged from hospital in Beijing later this month.

A toddler in CHina with a tumour the size of a melon is set to receive life-changing surgery

Last month, the world's biggest uterine tumour, weighing 30lbs and measuring 21 inches in diameter, was removed from an Indian woman.

Doctors in the southern city of Chennai performed a complex operation on a 52-year-old woman identified as Latha.

She had been suffering breathlessness and fatigue for several years but had no idea the giant tumour - similar to the size of a watermelon - was growing inside her.

Latha has recovered and has since been discharged from hospital.

Just days ago it was revealed that a toddler with a tumour the size of a melon growing from his bottom was set to receive life-changing surgery.

The tumour weighed in at almost as much as the young unnamed boy himself and medics in China were set to perform an operation to remove it, thanks to a flood of donations to help the youngster.

According to the boy's grandmother, there was no indication during the pregnancy that there was a anything unusual about the baby.

But when he was born, it became clear that he had a tumour the size of a grapefruit on his bottom.

The family sought help at many hospitals, most of which were unable to help, and all the while the tumour continued to grow, reaching the size of a melon.

The family’s plight was picked up by local media and a hospital stepped forward, agreeing to treat the boy, while donations flooded in from the public to pay for the treatment.

Experts at Quanzhou Children’s Hospital, who have accepted the child for an operation, say that the tumour can almost certainly be safely removed so that the boy can make a full recovery.
