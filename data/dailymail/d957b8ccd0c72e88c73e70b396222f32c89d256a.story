It might be unbelievable looking at her flawlessly toned body, but Lucy Mecklenburgh claims that her passion for exercise, workout empire and even her latest appearance on gymnastic reality show Tumble, all originated from her cellulite.

The 22–year-old shot to fame on The Only Way is Essex, but says it was precisely the lifestyle she was leading on the show- which involved a fair bit of drinking at nightclubs- that gave her the wake up call she needed.

Speaking to Women’s Fitness, the star says ‘I didn’t train at all. I was one of those girls who had the gym membership, but never went. And one day I was like, “OK I’m thin, but I’m unfit, I’m unhealthy and I’m starting to get cellulite – I need to do something.”’

The 22-year-old says she started to get cellulite from her former TOWIE unhealthy lifestyle 

Lucy with trainer and business partner Cecillia Harris who admits she had to create longer workouts to keep up with Lucy's enthusiasm for the training 

She began training with personal trainer Cecilia Harris, soon developing a love of exercise which eventually resulted in the pair starting ‘Results With Lucy’ which has now blossomed into a fitness empire.

However her enviable figure is the result of some serious dedication, both in the gym and the kitchen.

‘I love core work! I’m a really strange person who loves ab pain!’ she says. Cecilia agrees: ‘If I say, “Lucy what do you want to do: 20 press-ups or hold plank?” she’ll always say plank!’

Cecilia says: ‘I tend to do 30-minute interval-training sessions with all my clients.’ But Lucy wanted more! ‘I started doing 30 minutes, but then I wanted an hour!’ she says. ‘Once you start seeing improvements in your body, you want to do more.’

‘You can’t out-train a bad diet.

Lucy says that as tough as training for BBC's Tumble has been, it has given her a new body confidence 

‘I love eating clean now. I would never ever go back. Obviously I have treats, the same as everyone else: on the weekend I’ll have a dessert if I go out for dinner. But you know when you’ve eaten something bad - when you read the back of processed food packaging and there’s 25 ingredients, you know it’s not going to be good for you.

‘Everything I eat I usually make from scratch. Eating and nutrition are so important, especially if you’re training.

‘I like stir-fries because they’re quick and I’m busy.

‘Quinoa is my new best friend. I have it at breakfast for energy because I train in the mornings. I have quinoa, smoked salmon and scrambled egg. It’s on our EatWell plan.’

But despite now spending a large portion of her time working out, Lucy says that she has found the training for BBC’s Tumble gruelling, but that it has whipped her into her best shape ever and given her a new body confidence

Lucy warns that no matter how much exercise you do, you can't out train a bad diet and need to eat well 

Simple exercises, like this plank back-kick, that can be done at home are part of the reason 'Results With Lucy' has become such a sucess

‘I’m loving the training because I’m getting more definition. I’m using muscles I never knew existed. I like that feeling of feeling strong and I guess it makes me feel more confident,’ Lucy says.

‘I can’t wait to get into a bikini and show off my body after five hours a day of gymnastics training!’

‘We do four to five hours of training a day – trampolining, floor work and rhythmic gymnastics – and one day a week at circus school.

‘I’ve never sweated so much in my entire life. I’m pouring the whole time,’ she admits. ‘But you do feel yourself getting fitter.’

With the semi-finals for Tumble kicking off next week, the bar was raised on Saturday night’s episode.

Despite gaining immense confidence since her first week, Lucy’s seductive ribbon routine failed to impress the judges.

The beauty had to face off against John, whose trampoline routine was the lowest-scoring of the night.

However Lucy, who looked sexy in a metallic leotard and big bouncy curls, was pleased with her ribbon performance and admitted she’d finally come into her own.

‘I’m actually starting to enjoy to perform. I loved that routine! I am starting to get into the routines and get into character,’ she said

Lucy demonstrates the perfect technique for a curtsey squat 

CURTSEY SQUAT X 30 SECONDS

Start off standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.

Step forward and across your leg and sit into a squat pushing the hips back and keeping the chest tall.

Keep your upper body facing forward.

Return to the start and perform on the other leg. Continue alternating legs to complete set.

SAFETY TIP: Don’t let your upper back round

Lunges are a great exercise to improve balance and core strength as well as tone 

LUNGE x 30 SECONDS

Start in a standing position then take a large step forward with your left leg.

Bend the knee of the left leg as low as you can go, keeping your back leg extended and the foot on the floor.

Keep a straight back throughout and your arms out stretched in front.

Return to standing and repeat with the other leg. Continue,alternating legs.

Holding a weight is a great way to make this exercise more challenging once you are comfortable with it

LEG CRUNCH X 30 SECONDS

Lie flat on your back with your arms stretched above your head (holding a weight is optional).

Slowly lift your legs to a 45-degree angle, keeping them straight.

Bend your knees and bring your knees toward your chest until your hips are at a 90-degree angle.

At the same time bring your arms over your head until your hands are over the centre of your body, lifting your head and shoulders from the floor - you will be in a crunch position.

Hold this crunched position, then reverse the movement until you are back in the starting position, lying on the floor. Repeat for 30 seconds.

SAFETY TIP Don’t arch your lower back as you lift up
