These are the incredible birds eye view photos of Iceland’s extreme landscape - taken from up to 9,000ft in the air.

The stunning shots were captured by husband and wife duo Erlend Haarberg, 46, and Orsolya Haarberg, 35, as they soared above the beautiful Nordic nation.

The pair scaled mountains, trekked over some of the world’s most rugged terrain and took to the skies in a light aircraft to snap some of the world’s most spectacular scenery.

And the beautiful results reveal the drastically contrasting landscapes of Iceland - from explosive volcanoes to Europe’s largest icecap.

In one photograph, a fork of sideways lightening sparks out from the Eyjafjallajvkull volcano - which caused travel chaos when it erupted in 2010 - as it explodes into action.

Another shot appears to show a tree, but is actually a river delta running into several different streams.

Orsolya, from Jakobsli in Norway, who wed 
Erlend in 2005 before embarking on the epic photography project, said: 
'Normally I get sick when flying, so I was thankful for the calm 
conditions, otherwise I would have been in trouble.

'We had been forced to wait for two months for a day that wasn’t cloudy or raining. So when we woke up and it was sunny we knew we had to get in the air as quick as possible before it changed.

'But it was definitely worth being patient. Iceland’s landscape is so extreme and varied - it makes for such amazing viewing. The colours of the flat landscape really only become visible once you are in the air.'

Husband Erlend was charged with taking the extraordinary aerial images while his wife guided the pilot from the back of the light aircraft.

Erlend used an open window to capture clear shots of the world below as the plane banked to the left, allowing him to look straight down.

Incredibly, thanks to the poor weather, they covered the whole nation in just one five-hour flight before being forced to return as the fuel ran low.

Professional snapper Orsolya, who quit her studies to become a full-time photographer, added: 'It was a tight schedule. One minute we were photographing the erupting Eyjafjallajokull volcano and the next we were over Europe’s largest ice cap, the Vatnajvkull.

'Most tourists never get to see these places at all - let alone from the air. We feel privileged to have witnessed them first hand.

'We always try and show Iceland in a totally different light to the one the tourists often experience. That’s why we decided to focus on all the extremes and contrasts the country had to offer.

'People seem to be amazed by the abstract aerials, probably because they are almost alien-like.'The couple have now released a book called Iceland: Land of Contrast to document their travels.
