Brazil are right to be nervous about facing Chile tonight. They need only ask Spain just how dangerous their opponents are.

The way Chile rotate their midfield is so impressive and the key to their success. The players don’t seem to have concrete positions yet they all know their roles precisely. It’s typical of their incredible team ethic.

Rotation: Alexis Sanchez is Chile's key player but their fluid system means they can attack from anywhere

Danger man: Chile will challenge themselves to make it difficult for the seemingly unstoppage Brazil striker

Their two front players are the first line of defence: they work so hard to close down the opposition defenders. From front to back, every player has to defend and get forward, which makes them very dangerous.

The credit for that system has to go manager Jorge Sampaoli. 

I genuinely believe they could smother Brazil in possession. Sampaoli will surely have a plan to stop Neymar, which is maybe why he stopped training earlier this week when a helicopter hired by Brazilian TV flew over their training ground.

Mastermind: Sampaoli has built a brilliant team who even saw off world champions Spain to qualify

Team spirit: Chile have a style that caused trouble in their group and Brazil will need to watch out

Underdogs: Chile won't be favourites against Brazil - but neither were Spain who they saw off brillaintly

Chile's frontmen are their first line of defence and work really hard
