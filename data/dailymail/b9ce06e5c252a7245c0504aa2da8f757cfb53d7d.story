Forget the latest handbag, the new accessory du jour is Pudsey bear.

But not just any Pudsey will do: this year's Children In Need is all about the celebrity bears.

Eight stars have been immortalised as our favourite teddy for the charity. 

The VIP, or ‘Very Important Pudsey’, collection has been designed by iconic British names that include Coldplay, Joanna Lumley, Dame Helen Mirren, Dame Shirley Bassey, Sir Paul McCartney, Dame Judi Dench, Brian May and Sir Terry Wogan.

From McCartney’s Sgt Pepper style to Dame Helen Mirren’s holiday look and Terry Wogan’s Irish charm, each celebrity has been celebrated in their own unique way.

Luxury swimwear designer Melissa Odabash also helped emulate Dame Helen Mirren's iconic look by redesigning the famous bikini for Pudsey bear.

Coldplay noted, ‘Being allowed to dress Pudsey up in a Coldplay style is a massive honour. Viva la Vida Pudsey is made of trims from the actual outfits we wore in the Viva video so he's basically a band member.

‘We hope he'll go to a great home and raise lots of money for a very important cause.”

The range of bears are set to be displayed over the next two weeks at St Pancras International station concourse in London before being auctioned off on eBay to help raise money for Children In Need.

With the live appeal set to run on 15 November fans and bidders can take time to view the collection which is displayed alongside its celebrity imagery.

The bears themselves were a labor of love: Dame Shirley Bassey’s bear is swathed in over 3,500 Swarovski crystals.

Children In Need airs live on 15 November at 7pm on BBC1.
