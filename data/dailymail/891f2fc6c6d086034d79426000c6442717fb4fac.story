Police searching for missing toddler Sky Metalwala are investigating an online dating profile in his mother's name which was posted on a site advertised as 'a secure place for like-minded Sugar Daddies, Mommies and Sugar Babies to meet each other'.

The owner of the site - Brandon Wade - said police contacted him on November 10 asking about Julia Biryukova's profile and asked him to turn over login information and any messages going in and out.

Mr Wade said the page was created by someone using a Washington state Internet account, but because it was free there were no payment details or no real way to verify who it set it up.

Suspicious: Investigators are frustrated that Sky's mother isn't willing to take polygraph or 'lie-detecting' test

Missing: Sky Metalwala, 2, was reported missing by his mother after she says she left him sleeping alone in her unlocked car for an hour after it ran out of gas

The website, which is called seekingarrangement.com, hails itself as a place for sugar daddies, mommies and babies to meet.

Mr Wade said that Ms Biryukova - or 
the person who created her account - signed up to be a 'sugar baby' 
which he said means 'she's looking for someone wealthy to take care of 
her'.

According to MNBC, on the profile - 
which was created onJuly 25 - a person identifying herself only as 'JB' 
wrote she was 'looking for financial stability and assistance. I am 
looking for a successful mentor. I am looking for a REAL man.

'YOU tell me YOUR ideal' arrangement!"', adding that she expected a monthly income of $3,001 - $5,000.

The website features photographs 
similar to those posted on her Facebook page and describes her as a 
30-year-old  'non-drinker, non-smoker', who can 'speak fluent Russian, 
Ukrainian and English'.

Abandoned: The street corner, shown, where the mother says she left her two-year-old, is a mile from where she says she walked to get gas

Hour's walk: A gas station shown is where the mother told investigators she walked with her daughter after she ran out of gas about a mile away, leaving her 2-year-old son alone in her car

The last time the account was accessed was October 26. sky went missing on November 6.

The mother-of-two has so far refused a
police interview or polygraph test but police say there is no evidence 
to charge anyone with a crime yet.

Ms Biryukova is a native of Ukraine. 
She moved to the United States as a child and has spent most of her life
in Bellevue and the Eastside.

Her two-year-old son Sky has been 
missing for more than a week after she claimed she left him in the car 
while she and her daughter went to get gas.

But investigators have found that there 
was enough gas in the car to run a considerable distance, Bellevue 
police Maj Mike Johnson said last week.

Washington police said they are keeping an eye on the mother-of-two in case she tries to leave the country.

'We're not comfortable calling her a 
person of interest or a suspect. So I suppose if she did intend to make 
travel plans it would be something we'd want to know about and discuss 
with her,' Maj Mike Johnson said today.

Speaking about her flight risk, Maj Johnson said: 'It is something that's on our radar. We're watching for that.'

he did not rule out that Ms Biryukova
may be trying to smuggle her son out of the country as he is currently 
locked in a bitter custody battle with her husband Solomon.

'There's a lot of work going on to 
rule out possible theories of abduction, coercion, the element of 
custody battle between mom and dad, secreting him outside the country, 
all of these are viable theories,' Maj Johnson told ABC.

Custody battle: Sky's disappearance comes during a bitter divorce and custody fight between the mother and the boy's father Solomon Metalwala, seen holding Sky at an earlier time

He said Ms Biryukova's story has 
become less and less plausible as police have tried and failed to find 
any evidence that supports the facts as she presented them.

He
emphasized, however, that she remains cooperative in other ways, 
by answering every police question through her attorney, driving police 
along the route she drove and then walked, and allowing complete access 
to her home and car.

In the week before Sky disappeared, 
his parents reached a tentative agreement after a 12-hour mediation 
session that would allow Solomen Metalwala to have some visitation with 
the couple's two children.

But two days later — and two days 
before she reported her son missing — Biryukova decided to pull out of 
the agreement, Metalwala's divorce attorney, D. Michael Tomkins, said 
Wednesday.

In a letter sent by her attorney, 
Biryukova insisted that everyone at the mediation session had been 
against her and the settlement was unfair, Tomkins said.

Cooperating: Investigators are giving voluntary polygraph exams to the boy's father, shown at a press conference, along with several of his relatives

Visitation: The parents of Sky reached a tentative agreement that would allow the father to have some visitation with his two children, which the mother backed out of immediately before Sky's disappearance

The children didn't attend the marathon session, and it's possible they were left home alone for the entire time — raising the possibility that Sky could have become dehydrated, Tomkins said.

Papers filed in the divorce say that Ms Biryukova suffered from 'severe' obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Metalwala
wrote in a declaration that she would frequently go on ten-hour cleaning
binges during which she wouldn't even feed the children, but a doctor 
reported that her diagnosis did not interfere with her ability to care 
for the kids.

Johnson said Ms Biryukova acknowledged having a history of leaving the children home alone for extended periods of time. Police know whether she did so during the lengthy mediation — but they won't release that information, Maj Johnson said.
