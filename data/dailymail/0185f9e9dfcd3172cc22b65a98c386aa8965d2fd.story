An investment banker accused of murdering a university student outside a McDonald's restaurant had been playing Playstation with his friend before the attack.

Kyle Zandipour, 27, had been playing a basketball video game at home with his friend and it is believed he drank four beers before going to get some food on St Kilda Road in Melbourne where an argument broke out, the Herald Sun reported.

The ANZ investment banker was charged with the murder of Joshua Hardy, 21, following the incident that occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Mr Hardy, from Parkville, was reportedly intoxicated when he tripped Mr Zandipour's friend, who retaliated by pushing him.

Police allege Mr Zandipour then stepped in and attacked Mr Hardy, grabbing him by the arm and violently throwing to the ground head first, before kicking him in the head.

Police released these images of two men, one of whom allegedly kicked Mr Hardy in the head at about 1.10am on Saturday outside a McDonald's outlet in Melbourne

The second man identified in the CCTV footage provided a statement to police but will not face any charges

Zandipour was remanded in custody to appear in court again on October 24.

Another man, who was identified in CCTV footage at the fast food outlet moments before the assault, has provided a statement to police but will not face any charges.

The court heard allegations during an out-of-sessions court hearing that Mr Zandipour and the second man had been drinking and playing video games at the accused home before entering the fast-food restaurant and purchasing a meal.

Detective Senior Constable Julio Salerno then told the hearing that Mr Hardy 'staggered' up to their table, 'apparently inebriated', before sitting with them, The Herald Sun reports.

The three men had a conversation and when Mr Zandipour and the other man stood to leave,

Senior Constable Salerno said Mr Hardy appeared to attempt to trip Mr Zandipour which then led to a fight.

Mr Zandipour then 'used his arm to hook the deceased under his armpits and flip him' upside down, Constable Salerno claimed according to the Herald Sun.

Earlier, Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon alleged of the attack: '[Mr Hardy] was grabbed by the arm and violently thrown to the ground head first, and then kicked to the head. He lapsed into unconsciousness immediately.'

Trinity College said in a statement that it was deeply saddened by the news.

'Joshua came to Trinity in 2012 and soon became loved by all for his prowess on the footy field, his mentoring skills (he participated in the AIME mentoring program), and his community-mindedness. Josh was a wonderful student and brother whose sudden passing is a tremendous shock.' 

Friends took to Facebook to pay tribute to their friend. 

'RIP Joshua Hardy you were a close friend, a great friend and even a brother to me, words cannot begin to explain how sad I am to hear of such a nice guy being taken so soon,' wrote friend Anak Agung Gede Surya on Facebook.

A primary school friend, Shaun Hutchinson, wrote that he was devastated to lose 'an absolutely top bloke, true mate (and) one of the few people in this world that could bring a smile to all ... From knowing you as a young lad in primary school to exploring the city of Madrid recently, I am glad to have called you a mate and have had the pleasure of getting to know you,' reported the Herald Sun.
