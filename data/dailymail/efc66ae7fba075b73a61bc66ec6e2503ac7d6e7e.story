Gordon Ramsay, pictured today at the High Court with his wife Tana, has denied lying about his father 'forging' his signature on a rental agreement

Gordon Ramsay has insisted he is not lying about his signature being 'forged' on a £640,000-a-year rental agreement for a  lease on his London restaurant.

The celebrity chef is embroiled in a High Court battle over claims his father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson used a ghost writer machine to forge his signature on a 25-year contract for the York & Albany pub near Regent's Park.

Mr Ramsay claims the machine - which electronically replicates a signature using a fountain or ballpoint pen - was used without his consent.

He is now asking Chancery Division judge Mr Justice Morgan to grant him a declaration that the rental guarantee, signed in 2007, is not binding.

But film director Gary Love, who owns the York & Albany, has described Ramsay's allegation as an 'absurd' attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments. 

Today, during cross-examination on the second day of the case, Mr Ramsay denied lying about the nature of the allegedly forged signature, telling the court that his 'deep and extensive trust in Hutcheson was entirely misplaced'.

Mr Hutcheson - the father of Mr Ramsay's wife Tana - was previously at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings but left in 2010 after being accused of plundering £1m from company accounts. 

Mr Hutcheson always denied to comment and said he would 'respond through the legal process’.

Following a lengthy legal dispute, he was reportedly given around £2million in a settlement and severed ties with the company.  

In court today, Romie Tager QC, who cross-examined Ramsay on Mr Love's behalf, suggested to the chef that he was not telling the truth.

He claims Mr Ramsay knew about Mr Hutcheson using the ghost writer to sign business documents long before the York & Albany deal. 

Mr Tager said to him: 'When you expressed great displeasure about the signature being forged on documents, that is all manufactured.

'The fact is you didn't care whether the machine was used to write the signature and you don't really care today.'

But Mr Ramsay replied: 'That is untrue. I brought this case to court because of the shock and unhappiness of being somewhat stitched on a guarantee my wife and I not were not a party to.'

The chef is in a dispute with Gary Love (left) who says that Mr Ramsay's claims about his father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson (right) forging his signatures are 'absurd' 

Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH) won a bidding war in 2007 to secure the 160-year-old York & Albany building in the exclusive area of  north London.

At the time, Mr Hucheoson was CEO of the company. It has since been turned  into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel, with rooms starting at £150. 

The chef said in a written statement that the lease was not binding on him personally but on Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd (GRHL) and on Gordon Ramsay Holdings International Ltd (GRHI).

Mr Ramsay said it would have been 'unthinkable' to enter into a personal guarantee for each of the many restaurants he opened. 

Christopher Hutcheson, left, is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to forge his son-in-law's signature on 'various contracts' while at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. He left the business in 2010

Following their dispute in 2010, Mrs Ramsay (left) is thought to have severed ties with her father (pictured right with her mother, Greta)

He said that would entirely defeat the purpose of running each of them through separate corporate vehicles.

He added that the York & Albany was not a business venture he was 'personally taking forward' but that he was merely 'lending his name to help promote it and attract customers'.

He said: 'I am appalled at the extent to which Chris used the Ghost Writer machine to sign documents ostensibly on my behalf in circumstances where I had no knowledge of the documents that were being 'signed' or the matters to which they referred.' 

In 2010 Mr Hutcheson left his position in the company amid reports that he had a 'fiery relationship' with Mr Ramsay.

It was later claimed in court the former manager had breached terms of his confidentiality contract to access private emails and plunder more than £1million from the TV chef's empire.

The company acquired the York and Albany in 2007 after winning a bidding war for a lease on the 160-year-old building. It is now an upmarket pub, restaurant and hotel in north west London's Regent's Park

Mr Hutcheson was accused of writing himself 'five-figure cheques', and involving Mr Ramsay's siblings-in-law in the schemes.

In 2012 their dispute was settled, with Mr Ramsay's wife thought to have severed all ties with her family. 

The latest legal row comes as Mr Ramsay's lawyers were 'piecing back together' what remains of his business following his father-in-law's departure, the court was previously told.

Giving evidence yesterday, Mr Ramsay said that between six and nine months after Mr Hutcheson was 'removed from the business' in 2010, 'it was discovered then that the lease was signed by the ghost machine'.

He said it was discovered that 'there were several documents that had been forged'. 

Mr Hutcheson is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to sign 'various contracts' in his son-in-law's name without his knowledge during his time at the company. 

The case continues.
