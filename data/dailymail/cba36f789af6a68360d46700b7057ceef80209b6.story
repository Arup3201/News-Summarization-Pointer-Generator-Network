American fast food consumers are most satisfied with pizza chains Papa John's and Pizza Hut - and least satisfied with McDonald's, according to a new report.

The findings were published in the American Customer Satisfaction Index's (ACSI) 2014 restaurant report.

Top marks: Papa John's - along with Pizza Hut - scored highest in the report

Here they are! The ACSI's list of fast food chains and their satisfaction scores is pictured

Both Papa John's and Pizza Hut had a ACSI score of 82 out of a possible 100 this year. Papa John's score was the exact same score as last year's, while Pizza Hut went up from its 2013 score of 80.

Little Caesar and Domino's Pizza followed closely behind - each received a ACSI score of 80. Little Caesar dropped from 82 in 2013 to 80, and Domino's Pizza dropped down from 81.

McDonald's was at the bottom of this year's totem pole. This year, the chain's score was 71 - which was three percent lower than last year's 73.

McDonald's had the lowest satisfaction score in 2013, as well.

Taco Bell performed the second-worst, as its satisfaction score also dropped three percent and dipped from 74 to 72.

Bottom of the barrel: McDonald's had the lowest score for fast food restaurants, with just 71 out of 100

Of the fast food chains included in the report, KFC's ACSI score had the largest percentage drop. This year the chain scored 74, which is nine percent lower than last year's 81.

'While KFC is by far the largest of the chicken chains, it has struggled with increased competition from smaller chains like Chick-fil-A and Popeye’s,' the report says. 'Over the past five years, KFC has closed 600 stores.'

Fast food chains' on average scored 80 - the same figure reported in 2013 and 2012. That number is slightly lower than the average for 'full-service' sit-down restaurants, the report found.

The average score for full-service restaurants this year was 82, up slightly from last year's 81.

'This year’s small gain is driven by improvement in smaller chains and restaurants, which make up the bulk of the sit-down industry,' the report explained.
