Marked for death: Brett Hartman claims he had nothing to do with the brutal 1997 murder of Winda Snipes in Akron, Ohio

A condemned killer who claimed he was wrongfully accused of stabbing a woman 138 times, slitting her throat and cutting off her hands was put to death today.

Death row inmate Brett Hartman has acknowledged he had sex with victim Winda Snipes early on the morning of September 9, 1997 at her Akron apartment, but did not kill her.

Today, he calmly accepted his death.

'I'm good, let's roll,' he said in his final words.

He then smiled in the direction of his sister and repeatedly gave her, a friend and his attorney a 'thumbs up' with his left hand.

'This is not going to defeat me,' Hartman then said to warden Donald Morgan, who didn't respond.

The effect of the single dose of pentobarbital did not seem as immediate as in other executions at the state prison in Lucasville, in southern Ohio.

Four minutes after Hartman first appeared to be reacting to it as his abdomen began to rise and fall, his abdomen rose and fell again, he coughed and his head shifted rhythmically for a few moments.

His sister, Diane Morretti, dabbed at her eyes during the process. The warden declared Hartman's time of death as 10:34am.

Both Hartman's attorney, David Stebbins, and prisons system spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said the gap between Hartman's movements was not out of the ordinary.

Hartman claimed he did not kill Snipes, but found mutilated body and panicked, trying to clean up the mess before calling 911. It was a claim rejected by numerous courts over the years.

The U.S. Supreme Court denied a last-minute appeal by Hartman yesterday.

Hartman's last meal, which in Ohio is called a special meal, consisted of steak with sauteed mushrooms, fried shrimp, Macaroni & Cheese, a baked potato with butter and sour cream, Rainforest Crunch cereal, cans of Pepsi and Dr Pepper, and a bowl of Honey-Comb cereal, a prison spokesman told MailOnline.

Hartman is the 49th inmate put to death since Ohio resumed executions in 1999.

Hartman came within about a week of execution in 2009 before federal courts allowed him to pursue an innocence claim.

When that claim failed, Hartman had a new date set last year, but that was postponed because of a federal lawsuit over Ohio's execution policy.

Murdered: Ms Snipes had been stabbed 138 times. Her throat had been cut and her hands were cut off in the gruesome murder in her home

The Ohio Parole Board has unanimously denied Hartman's requests for clemency three times, citing the brutality of the Snipes' slaying and the 'overwhelming evidence' of Hartman's guilt.

Hartman's attorneys have long said that crucial evidence from the crime scene and Snipes' body has never been tested, raising questions about Hartman's innocence.

The evidence included fingerprints allegedly found on a clock and a mop handle. Hartman also argues the evidence could implicate an alternate suspect.

Second, the attorneys argue that if Hartman's innocence claim is not accepted, he should still be spared because of the effects of a 'remarkably chaotic and nomadic early childhood,' including being abandoned by his mother and left with an aunt on an isolated Indian reservation.

Third, lawyers say Hartman's behavior in prison has been exemplary and shows he is a changed man.

They cite his devotion to religious studies, his development as an artist and community service projects in prison.

The state opposed these arguments, citing the strength of the evidence and the fact that courts have repeatedly upheld Hartman's conviction and death sentence.

The state also said Hartman refuses to take responsibility and show remorse.
