Jailed: Mark Leslie, 28, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court was put behind bars for 12 months for leaving two luxury hotels without paying

A conman who stayed at two luxury hotels and spent over £2,000 on fine dining and expensive suites before leaving without paying has been jailed for 12 months.

Mark Leslie, 28, posed as a businessman entertaining clients when he visited two hotels -  Lumley Castle, Durham and Close House, in Heddon-on-the-Wall near Newcastle.

He booked in to Lumley Castle, where rooms start at £120 a night, on July 28 last year with his wife and four-year-old son.

The father-of-three also booked another suite for an unnamed man.

He had racked up a bill for £624 at the hotel - which has 73 rooms, some with four-poster beds and jacuzzi-style baths - and left without paying.

On
August 3 he checked in to another exclusive hotel Close House, at Heddon-on-the-Wall, where golfer Lee Westwood often plays.

Again, 
he booked two rooms, one for him and his family and the other for two drag queens that he claimed were clients.

He 
spent two nights at the £230-a-night hotel, amassing a room, restaurant and bar bill of 
£1,459.95, before leaving without handing in his keys or paying. He also hired three golf buggies during his stay.

The conman, from North Tyneside, denied two charges of making off without payment at Newcastle Crown Court as he claimed the hotels provided poor service.

However Leslie, a former bar and pub chain 
area manager, was convicted and jailed for 12 months.

He also
pleaded guilty to a separate charge of fraud after taking £400 for an 
inflatable hot tub which he advertised on eBay then failed to provide.

Leslie
also admitted fraud and forgery in relation to obtaining a loan from payday loans shop Cheque Centre in North Shields after he used a faked bank statement to get money.

The conman was already subject to a suspended prison sentence for a fraud from 
last year involving obtaining a car on finance then advertising it on 
eBay.

Recorder Tim Kerr QC told Leslie: 'I’m afraid the record shows you to be a devious and deceitful young man, of cunning and some intelligence.

'I accept your family is under financial pressure, but so are thousands of families.

'I think if given your liberty you would use it to devise new scams to defraud the public.'

Peter Schofield, defending, said: 'He was in worthwhile employment and the business fell on difficult times. There was pressure on the family finances.

'He is a young man and, with his family and friends, he clearly has been tempted to obtain services in the manner which he did. He has been working for the coastguard voluntarily and for the fire service.'
