With body beautiful celebrities 
adorning the covers of all our favourite magazines, it is no surprise 
that we have become a society obsessed with image.

And as celebrities become seemingly more slender with every passing day, more of us than ever are turning to liposuction for a helping hand - and that includes celebrities such as Lizzie Cundy and Binky Felstead, who have publicly endorsed new, less invasive forms of fat removal.

Now, according to the latest statistics, liposuction has now become the most popular treatment in the world.

In demand: According to the latest statistics, liposuction has become the most popular treatment in the world

Figures released this month from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS) reveal that liposuction was the most heavily requested treatment in the world.

And it seems that people are so keen to seek out the best possible treatment that they are prepared to travel to find the newest and most effective methods - with London tipped as the best place to come for fat removal.

One London clinic has reported a 35 per cent rise in enquiries for their minimally invasive liposuction technique, driven in part by an increase in overseas visitors travelling to the capital for their treatments.

In 2012 The Private Clinic on Harley Street experienced a 34.9 per cent increase in enquiries for VASER liposuction and VASER Hi Def – both forms of minimally invasive liposuction – compared to 2011.

The Private Clinic’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Mike Comins, believes the trend will continue into 2013, saying: 'In the last few months alone I have treated a number of patients who have flown in from countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Italy and the Middle East.

'These patients are willing to travel thousands of miles to London, in the knowledge that they will receive the very latest techniques and technologies, delivered by some of the best practitioners in the industry.

'VASER HI DEF, which involves removing fat from around the underlying musculature and thus producing a more sculpted result, is particularly popular with patients from overseas.

'The number of experienced practitioners offering VASER Hi Def internationally is, relatively speaking, very low and therefore patients seeking the treatment often have no choice but to travel.

'Of course the fact that treatments 
such as this can be delivered by specialist practitioners in London, 
makes it even more accessible for these international patients.

'The
 internet also means that patients can research clinics and doctors from
 all over the world, and are therefore not restricted to the expertise 
readily available in their own geographical area.'

According
 to Dr Comins the type of individual expressing an interest in this form
 of specialist liposuction technique has also changed: 'Now I see a far 
greater number of men coming in for VASER lipo than ever before.

Honed to perfection: 54-year-old Donovan underwent a new type of lipo called VASER so that he could keep up with his 33-year-old girlfriend proving how men are fans too

'And while some five or so years ago the majority of men I treated were in their thirties, now I’m seeing an increasing number of men in their 50s and 60s who, despite leading active, healthy lifestyles, are unable to maintain the bodies that they had when they were younger.

'For these men, VASER helps to ensure that they can continue to look good later into life and they are willing to travel long distances to be treated.'
