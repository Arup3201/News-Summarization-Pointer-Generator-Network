Police are treating the tragic death of a toddler who fell into a private pond as 'unexplained'.

The young boy is believed to have fallen into a garden pond in Woodmansey, near Beverley, East Yorkshire yesterday.

Emergency services, including a local air ambulance, were called in a desperate bid to save him.

A two-year-old died after falling into a pond in Ferry Lane, Woodmansey, East Yorkshire yesterday

He was flown to nearby Hull Royal Infirmary but medics say he did not respond to treatment and died not long after entering the water.

A woman, aged 29, was arrested and questioned by police who arrived at the scene, but has now been released on bail.

Police say there are currently treating the death as 'unexplained' and the boy's heartbroken family are being supported by a specialist team.

Woodmansey Parish Council chairman Councillor Kerri Harold said: 'This will shock everyone. It is a close-knit community and I'm sure everyone will be devastated. A two-year-old child has lost his life. It is a tragedy.'

Jayne Reid, landlady of the nearby Warton Arms pub, added: 'It is terribly, terribly sad. It is such a tragedy to happen to a child and we are very sad to hear it.'

A spokesman for Humberside Police said: 'A two-year-old boy sadly died yesterday in Woodmansey, Beverley after falling in to a private pond and was unresponsive to treatment.

'The toddler was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary yesterday by air ambulance, but sadly died a short time later.

'A 29-year-old woman was arrested following the incident, however she has been released on police bail until the end of April.

'Specially trained police officers are with the little boy's family and are offering them support, during this terrible time.'

Local police officer, PC Darren Kirkwood, later tweeted: 'Two year old boy sadly died after falling into a private pond - Woodmansey. Thoughts with the family #HumbersidePolice'

A police guard remained outside the house where the tragedy happened today.
