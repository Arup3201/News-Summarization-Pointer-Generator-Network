If your average slip and slide doesn't give your enough of a thrill, then this terrifying waterslide is the ride for you.

The awe-inspiring SkyCaliber loop de loop waterslide, developed in Missouri, will break three world records when it opens next year.

It boasts the first vertical freefall, the tallest vertical loop and the fastest ever speed in a waterslide.

And its creator Lance Fisher claims the idea for the record-breaking ride, which puts thrill-seekers in a safety cage, came to him in a dream in 2012.

The terrifying ride, developed in Missouri, boasts the first vertical freefall, the tallest vertical loop and the fastest ever speed in a waterslide

At 30ft, the vertical loop is the tallest in a waterslide and thrill-seeking riders are dropped from 90ft high in a safety cage

Mr Fisher, who is President of Skyturtle Technologies Ltd, dreamt that he was in a drop capsule and when the floor dropped out he saw the slide was straight down so he grabbed the walls of the capsule and it came down with him.

As soon as he woke up, he jotted the idea for the waterslide in his notepad and set to work on the SkyCaliber. 

It then took more than a year and a half to construct the ride.

Adrian Duke, CEO of Avalanche Waterslides Inc, who manufactured the ride, said: 'It is a 100ft tower, the rider is launched from 90ft down a completely vertical free fall that leads into a 30 foot tall vertical loop!

Riders of the crazy ride will experience a 45ft vertical drop which starts from a stomach-churning 90ft high

'It reaches speeds over 50 miles per hour and over 5Gs.'

He added: 'SkyCaliber will be the world's fastest waterslide. It will also be the first vertical freefall and tallest vertical loop in a waterslide. 

'All of these records are pending Guiness World Records measurement but we have internally confirmed these.'

But Mr Duke added despite the fear-inducing specifications, the ride is completely safe.

'We have undergone extensive testing and engineering to ensure that riders are safe.

'We designed and patented the raft which is the innovation that allows the rider to be safe when completing a vertical loop.

'We have also added in mesh siding so that the riders cannot put their hands out and touch the slide at the same time as maintaining airflow so that the rider isn't claustrophobic and still gets wet, after all it is a waterslide.'

'We can confidently say that our testing to this point has proven that the concept is very safe and the ride experience is unrivaled in the water park industry.'

Reaching speeds more 50 miles per hour and over 5Gs, the SkyCaliber is also the world's fastest waterslide according to its developers
