Chinese soldiers chased American journalists who attempted to shed light on a secretive military unit 
believed to be behind hacking attacks on the U.S. government.

The journalists were driving away from soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, when the men started chasing the car while journalists were filming.

Video footage from a moving vehicle appears to show the soldiers break into a run, and keep pace with the car, while panicked journalists urge their driver: 'Keep driving. Keep driving, drive away. Drive away!'

The clip has been released following revelations from U.S.
security firm Mandiant that the People's Liberation Army's 
Shanghai-based Unit 61398 is the most likely driving force behind hundreds, if not thousands of cyber attacks.

It said a Shanghai office block is 
linked to stolen technology blueprints, manufacturing processes, 
clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and 
other secret data from the U.S government and more than 100 aerospace, 
communications and energy companies.

More
alarmingly, it claims the unit, known as the Comment Crew, has also 
made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines, 
power grids, water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure.

'The nature of Unit 61398's work is considered by China to be a state secret,' Mandiant said in a report released in the United States.

'However, we believe it engages in harmful "Computer Network Operations".

'It
is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China and we wanted
to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that
threat effectively,' it said.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry today dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking.

'Source of attacks': Unit 61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in English as well as computer programming and network operations, the report said

Ground zero: The building, used by the People's Liberation Army, is located on the outskirts of Shanghai

'Hacking
attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins are 
extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called 
report can be tenable,' spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing.

'Arbitrary criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible, unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue.'

Hong cited a Chinese study which pointed to the United States as being behind hacking in China.

'Of the above mentioned Internet hacking attacks, attacks originating from the United States rank first.'

China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the report.

Prolific: The unit, known as Comment Crew, is alleged to have stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006

Denial: The Chinese Foreign Ministry today dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking

Unit
61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district, China's financial and 
banking hub and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in 
English as well as computer programming and network operations, Mandiant
said in its report.

The 
unit had stolen 'hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 
organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 
2006', it said.

Some 115 of the victims were located in the United States, with smaller numbers in Canada and Britain.

The information stolen ranged from details on mergers and acquisitions to the emails of senior employees, the company said.

Such is the fear of China's cyber weaponry, American companies have been warned not to do business with two of its leading technology firms because they pose a national security threat.

The House Intelligence Committee said in a report in October that U.S. regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the country by Huawei Technologies Ltd and ZTE Corp, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones.

Two weeks earlier, the White House revealed that cyber attackers linked to the Chinese government attempted to hack into a computer system in the White House Military Office.

While the official statement down played the attack, one report claimed that the hackers targeted the hardware which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes.

The 
state-run Medicaid system in Utah was also hacked last year, prompting calls
for tightened security around any government health databases that 
would be implemented in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.

While attacks on state infrastructure poses the greatest risk, the effect cyber warfare in the private sector can also be catastrophic.

In November 2011, the National Counterintelligence Committee released a report detailing the extent of damage done by Chinese and Russian hackers on various companies.

One
example was that of a paint company called Valspar Corportation, which 
had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen. The move cost the
company $20million.Â 

Foxconn,
a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in 
America including iPhones, was hacked in February by a group called 
Swagg Security which then obtained and released the email and credit 
card data for banking information for American companies including Apple
and Microsoft.

Some experts said they doubted Chinese government denials.

'The
PLA plays a key role in China's multi-faceted security strategy, so it 
makes sense that its resources would be used to facilitate economic 
cyber espionage that helps the Chinese economy,' said Dmitri 
Alperovitch, chief technology officer and co-founder of CrowdStrike, one
of Mandiant's competitors.

Though
privately held and little known to the general public, Mandiant is one 
of a handful of U.S. cyber-security companies that specialise in 
attempting to detect, prevent and trace the most advanced hacking 
attacks, instead of the garden-variety viruses and criminal intrusions 
that befoul corporate networks on a daily basis.

But
Mandiant does not promote its analysis in public and only rarely issues
topical papers about changes in techniques or behaviours.

It
has never before given the apparent proper names of suspected hackers 
or directly tied them to a military branch of the Chinese government, 
giving the new report special resonance.

The
company published details of the attack programmes and dummy websites 
used to infiltrate U.S. companies, typically via deceptive emails.

U.S.
officials have complained in the past to China about sanctioned 
trade-secret theft, but have had a limited public record to point to.

Mandiant
said it knew the PLA would shift tactics and programmes in response to 
its report, but concluded that the disclosure was worth it because of 
the scale of the harm and the ability of China to issue denials in the 
past and duck accountability.

The
company traced Unit 61398's presence on the Internet - including 
registration data for a question-and-answer session with a Chinese 
professor and numeric Internet addresses within a block assigned to the 
PLA unit - and concluded that it was a major contributor to operations 
against the U.S. companies.

Members
of Congress and intelligence authorities in the United States have 
publicised the same general conclusions: that economic espionage is an 
official mission of the PLA and other elements of the Chinese 
government, and that hacking is a primary method.

In
November 2011, the U.S. National Counterintelligence Executive publicly
decried China in particular as the biggest known thief of U.S. trade 
secrets.

The Mandiant report
comes a week after U.S. President Barack Obama issued a long-awaited 
executive order aimed at getting the private owners of power plants and 
other critical infrastructure to share data on attacks with officials 
and to begin to follow consensus best practices on security.

Both
U.S. Democrats and Republicans have said more powerful legislation is 
needed, citing Chinese penetration not just of the largest companies but
of operations essential to a functioning country, including those 
comprising the electric grid.
