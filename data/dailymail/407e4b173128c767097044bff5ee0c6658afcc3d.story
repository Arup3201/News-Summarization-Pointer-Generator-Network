For some people, even the mere thought of running a race is enough to make them shiver.

But one daredevil was literally left quaking in his boots after subjecting himself to one of the most physically demanding challenges known to man - the annual Tough Guy Race.

James Appleton, a 28-year-old adventure and travel photographer from Wirral, was initially unable to celebrate coming in third place in the race in Wolverhampton, because he was suffering from severe hypothermia.

Tough Guy is among the extreme assault courses offered in the UK to test people to their limits

The race features an array of obstacles to over come amid treacherous conditions - hot and cold, mud and even electric shocks.

The website for the extreme assault course explains: 'Tough Guy is a window of opportunity to test oneself, on every discipline in life, in one day.' 

In footage shot at the event, James can seen paddling through freezing waters.

'After the under water tunnel I lost all sense of time', James slurs afterwards. 'I didn't really know what was going on.'

As his body temperature plummets, the participant is unable to speak properly and lacked coordination.

He is immediately thrown into a warm shower to recover after people rush to help him and remove his ice cold clothing since he is pretty much incapable. 

At the end of the clip, James is standing over a fire and holds a blanket around him to keep the heat in.

He is questioned by the cameraman as to why he was motivated to take up such a ludicrous challenge - 'Will you tell me why you run this?' 

James, who has completed five winter Tough Guy races and seven summer ones, struggles to answer: 'Uh... I don't really know any more.'

This year's race was won by  by John Albon from Norway, who is videoed helping James into a hot shower after the event.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, James says that it is hard to describe how it feels to know you're become increasingly hypothermic and still want to carry on and race. 

'Any normal sane person would take the first chance to get into the warm and raise their body temperature back to normal, but when you're racing you have to deal with the knowledge it's going to get a lot, lot worse before it gets any better.

'I go into pretty heavy shut-down but I know that whatever happens, if I keep dragging myself forwards I'll make it to the end, and just hope I can do it quickly enough to finish well. It's a bit of a never surrender attitude, and it does work.

He also admits that this is not the first time he has subjected himself to hypothermia, although that did not put him off doing it all over again.

'When I won in 2009 I spent four hours in an aid station afterwards, but I think this year I may have been worse than that - fortunately I had people looking out for me at the finish this time round. 

At times James is suffering so much from hypothermia that he can barely walk and sways from side to side

There is panic in the voices of the two men supporting James as they realise how cold he is

'I do Tough Guy mostly for the competitive side - I want to go back each year to race the event and do as well as I can. 

'That said, I also find it gives you a "reset" where you start the year with a challenge, the pride of completing it, and then the memory of the physical and mental destruction to compare the rest of your year too - it makes everything else seem much tamer!' 

James is used to putting himself through  challenges and feats of endurance, from running from coast-to-coast across Britain, to wilderness hikes in the Arctic Circle or climbing erupting volcanos in winter.

The competitor comes third but barely has time to celebrate before race winner John Albon rushes him to have a hot shower

Even after the hot shower and standing by an open fire, James can't stop physically shaking 

His friends and family are supportive however, he reassures, 'though for the most part it's something they would never do themselves. 

'The one person I wish was still around to show all of this to would be my maternal grandfather - he was an incredible mountaineer who climbed in the Himalaya with Edmund Hillary, and a huge inspiration to how I want my life to be. 

'I like to this he'd have been proud of my racing achievements within this sport.'

What advice would James give to somebody entering one of those races? 

'Get your clothing right and practice the feeling of sudden cold water in safety. I choose to wear lighter layers because I want to be fast, but in reality the safest thing is to rely on neoprene and merino wool layers.'

He explains that its important for racers to know how it feels to suddenly drop into cold water so that they don't panic on the day.  

'You can do this at home in your shower or in a safely shallow outdoor lake,' he advises. 

'But have someone standing by the first time in case it really shocks you, and never jump into deep water - always somewhere you can stand up if it gets too much.'
