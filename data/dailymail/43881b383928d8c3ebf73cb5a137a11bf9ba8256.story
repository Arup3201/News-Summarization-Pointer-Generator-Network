Top referee Phil Dowd is the latest official to face allegations from within the referees’ fraternity that he has received favourable treatment from the beleaguered Professional Game Match Officials Ltd.

This follows calls for PGMO boss Mike Riley to be replaced in the continued fall-out from the Mark Clattenburg affair. 

Clattenburg was suspended for a game after leaving a match in his own car rather than the official vehicle and taking a call from Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock, but others have allegedly escaped punishment for similar breaches of regulations.

It has been claimed that Dowd, who failed a fitness test at the end of the 2011-12 season before losing a noticeable amount of weight, didn’t pass a test at the start of this season. 

But he was allowed to carry on officiating after passing another test, which was quickly arranged with PGMO sports scientist Simon Brevik away from the usual venues.

The PGMO insist Dowd did not fail a ‘test’, but they would not comment about him starting the test exercise but not being able to complete it because of injury. 

The PGMO added there is no designated location for fitness tests.
