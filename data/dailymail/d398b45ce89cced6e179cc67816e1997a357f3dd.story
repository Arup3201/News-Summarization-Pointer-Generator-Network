John Ankers, 40, was arrested outside a Tesco store in Hattersley, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, after trying to punch an officer during Black Friday sales

The first shopper in Britain to be prosecuted over 'retail rioting' after he threw a punch at a police officer during a scramble for bargains in the Black Friday sales has walked free from court.

John Ankers, 40, was arrested outside a Tesco store in Hattersley, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, after swinging a punch at police as he tried to buy cheap alcohol.

He, along with hundreds of shoppers, charged the store after it opened its doors just after midnight on Friday, November 28.

He was arrested for threatening behaviour, but escaped a prison sentence at Tameside Magistrates' Court today where he was ordered to pay more than £200 in fines and costs.

Officers who had been called to the supermarket at five past midnight on Black Friday following reports of fighting in the store, found 300 people scrambling for bargains when they arrived at the scene.

Ankers arrived just as police advised staff to close the shop, which came just five minutes after its opening, to help restore order among customers.

When told by a police officer he could not enter the shop to buy anything, Ankers retorted: 'Who closed it I bet it was you f****** lot'.

He then added: 'Do you want a f****** go, let's have a f****** fight, that field outside'.

Ankers then swung a fist towards the officer, narrowly missing his head and shouted 'come on then' before being arrested, the court heard.

It was one of seven incidents of public disorder involving Tesco shops across Greater Manchester during Black Friday's infamous rush for heavily-discounted items.

At the time, the mass sale sparked fury from the county's chief constable Sir Peter Fahy who condemned supermarkets for 'creating situations where officers had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers'.

The Black Friday phenomenon has spread to the UK in recent years after becoming a big hit in the U.S., where traditionally big sales occur on the first Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday. 

Ankers, from Hyde, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour and was fined £110 with £85 costs at court today. He was also told he must pay a victim surcharge of £20.

After the court hearing he said 'I've been vilified,' but refused to comment any further.

During the hearing, prosecutor Miss Claire Harris outlined Ankers' actions leading up to his arrest.

She told the court: 'The defendant tried to enter the store to try and buy alcohol. He was informed by officers it was closed. He said, 'who closed it I bet it was you f****** lot'.

'He muttered something under his breath and walked out. A few minutes later police were alerted to a commotion in the foyer.

'The defendant was stood there. He saw the officer that he had previously spoken to and said 'do you want a f****** go, let's have a f****** fight, that field outside'. The officer asked what his problem was and began to usher him out of the store.

'He swung a fist towards the officer, narrowly missing his head. He shouted 'come on then'. He was taken to the ground and arrested.'

The incident occurred at the Tesco Extra store in Hattersley, Greater Manchester (pictured), on Black Friday 

The court heard how Ankers has 13 previous convictions for 23 offences, six of which are for public order offences.

The last offence was committed in January last year when he broke into a police station while drunk in a bid to steal computers.

Mr Russell Wild, mitigating, said Ankers had accepted he has anger management issues.

He told the court: 'His perception of matters were that police were singling him out.

'He accepted that he acted aggressively and doesn't seek to excuse his actions.

'He also accepts that he has anger management problems and has been on a course for this through his doctor. He is aware that there is a problem and he is trying to do something about it.'

His arrest was one of several incidents in connection with 'retail rioting' during last month's Black Friday.

Two other men, both from Manchester, are currently awaiting trial for assault over disturbances during the sales.

Black Friday descended into chaos at many stores in the Greater Manchester area, with police being called to Tesco stores in Wigan, Salford, Stretford, Walkden and Failsworth, among others.

At the time, Sir Peter said the events were 'totally predictable' and said he was disappointed that stores did not have 'sufficient' security staff on duty.

He said: 'This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers.

'It does not help that this was in the early hours when police resources are already stretched.

'Across Greater Manchester large supermarkets already make significant demands on policing through calls to shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and thefts of fuel from their petrol stations - much of which is preventable.

'We just ask these stores to work with us to reduce the demands on policing and reduce the risks of disorder and crime.'
