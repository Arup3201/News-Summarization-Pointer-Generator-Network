Christy Turlington is the face of British Vogue next month, exactly 28 years after her first appearance on the fashion bible’s coveted cover.

The American model, 45, who has worked in the industry for over three decades, shot to fame in the late eighties when she landed a contract with Calvin Klein that ended up spanning 20 years.

Along with Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, Christy is regarded as part of the original supermodel clan of the 1990s.

She's back! 18 years after her first ever cover for British Vogue, Christy Turlington graces the magazine's July issue

This will be Christy’s 15th British Vogue cover. In July 1986 she wore Donna Karan and was shot by Patrick Demarchelier for her first British Vogue cover. In November 1987 she was on the cover again, this time shot by Brit David Baily.

In 1990, she appeared on the magazine again, with Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Cindy Crawford, for what is still regarded as one of the most iconic covers and captures the young, fresh-faced models on the cusp of their phenomenal success as leading supermodels and international celebrities.

Born in California in 1969, Christy’s family moved to Miami when she was in school and her father was working as a training captain for Pan Am. It was in Florida that she was discovered by a local photographer Dennie Cody whilst she was horse riding.

She began modelling for local departments stores after school when she was 14, and moved to New York to pursue the career full-time when she was 18.

She has since appeared on over 500 magazine covers and numerous ad campaigns including Maybelline and Versace.

As well as her astounding modelling career, Christy has been an advocate for a number of charities. She modelled naked for animal-rights groups PETA in 1993 and, in 2005, began working with the international humanitarian organization CARE. She has since become their Advocate for Maternal Health and is an ambassador for Product Red.

In 1994, at the height of her career, Christy took a break from modelling to focus on her college degree.

She graduated in 1999 from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study of New York University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a concentration in Comparative Religion and Eastern Philosophy.

‘I never thought I would model for more than a few years,’ she told Interview magazine last year. ‘Each year I would say "one more year," and that got old. So, after one particularly gruelling season at the couture shows in Paris in the summer of '94, I decided that was it. I came home and applied to NYU and started classes that fall.’

Over her 31 year career she has walked in catwalk shows for Versace, Christian Lacroix, Vivienne Weswtood, Thierry Mulger amongst others.

‘While I 
haven't worked as a full-time model for about 20 years, I've always 
maintained a few relationships,’ she told Interview.

‘Calvin
 and Maybelline are the two longest. I'm flattered by the offers I 
receive, but there's no real strategy to the way I choose what to do 
these days. If I'm in a good mood and have the time, I'm more likely to 
consider it.’

As the face of Calvin Klein, Christy fronted dozens of underwear and fragrance campaigns for the brand - she even currently appears in an advert for its iconic Eternity perfume with her actor husband of 11 years, Ed Burns.

Christy was the fragrance's first face, back in 1988. ‘In the beginning we were pretty giggly,’ she told The LA Times of the couple’s sexy shoot.

‘After the first day, Ed said to me, “I'm so glad you're not doing this with somebody else.” I said “I wouldn't be doing this with someone else.” Usually you pretend to be intimate on these types of campaigns, and when they go to change a lens or the roll of film is complete, you're like, “So, how about those Mets?” It's just awkward.’

Last year Christy modelled another underwear campaign for Calvin Klein, for which they paid $5 million to her not-for-profit charity she set up, Every Mother Counts.

She launched the organization in 2010 to end preventable deaths caused by childbirth. She herself suffered heavy bleeding following the birth of her first child.
