Parliament's Victorian plumbing is causing a stink in the corridors of power.

There has been a surge in complaints from MPs and peers about smelly toilets, cracked cisterns, flooded floors and sewage pouring down office walls, MailOnline can reveal.

This summer complaints are running at more than a third higher than the same time last year, with a multi-billion pound renovation of Parliament still years off.

In the last two years there have been more than 4,300 complaints about the toilets and plumbing in Parliament

The problems are so bad that engineers receive the equivalent of more than seven complaints every day of the week.

In the last two years alone, there have been more than 4,300 complaints about the toilets and plumbing in Parliament.

Every part of Parliament has been affected, from an overflowing gents toilet in the Bishops Corridor to missing toilet rolls and broken lights in the ministerial corridor in the Commons.

Toilets are regularly blocked, sinks over-flowing and cubicles flooded. There are frequent requests for floors to be mopped, bins to be emptied and new handryers to be fitted.

There are complaints about 'poo all over the floor', vomit in sinks and toilet paper hanging from ceilings.

A frequent demand is for broken toilet seats to be replaced. One complained 'the one current is cracked please do asap as it bites'.

In April this year a ladies toilet flooded, leaving 'water pouring down walls through to ground floor' and raising concerns about electrics.

The ancient plumbing has also started making bizarre sounds. 'When the tap water pours there is a very loud banging sound coming from the toilets area,' said one.

'Men's toilets cracked seat and is making a dull sound when flushing,' said another.

Since the start of the year there have been growing numbers of complaints.

In February there were 172 complaints lodged with the Parliamentary authorities, up 6 per cent.

By April the number was 170, up 37 per cent year-on-year, and by May it hit 163, up 41 per cent. June was also up 31 per cent to 213, according to figures obatined by MailOnline.

In May this year there were several complaints about a 'bad smell of sewage around the coffee machine' and 'constantly leaking water'.

Offices, corridors, kitchens, the press gallery, lifts, function rooms and even the Speaker's Office have been blighted by a 'strong smell of sewage'. 

Since the start of this year, monthly complaints about toilets in Parliament are running at around a third higher than the same period in 2013, according to figures obtained by MailOnline

Michael Gove was moved from being Education Secretary to become Chief Whip in last month's reshuffle

Michael Gove's new role as government Chief Whip got off to an inauspicious start when he became trapped in a toilet in Parliament.

Not only did he lose his first vote in charge - after Labour ambushed him over plans to have its manifesto independently audited - it later emerged he almost missed the vote altogether.

Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow Commons leader, revealed: 'He not only lost his first vote but he managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby and he nearly broke his own whip.'

Mr Gove's Cabinet colleague William Hague leapt to his defence, insisting he was just being thorough and making sure there were no MPs hiding in the toilets.

'Knowledge of who is in the toilets in whatever lobby is a very important piece of information for any chief whip,' Mr Hague said.

'I take this as evidence he was carrying out his duties very assiduously.'

One complaint lodged in January read: 'Please can someone clean the toilets as an MP has called them 'disgusting'. The cubical on the left is very dirty.

Former Labour Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw has frequently complained about urine pouring into his Commons office.

In November 2012 he took to Twitter to complain that his office 'stinks' after sewage from a toilets above his office seeped through Parliament's crumbling walls. He branded the incident 'urinegate'.

And on July 3 this year he reported: 'Foul smelling urine pouring into office *again* much worse than before. evacuated. electrics down.'

Mr Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, told MailOnline: 'We've had urine pour into our office twice in the last year from a gents loo upstairs.

'The Commons staff have responded quickly but it hasn't been very nice and the second time it happened we had to evacuate because of the smell, and the flood blew the electrics.

'Apparently the old pipes are so corroded they're springing more and more leaks. It feels as if a large parts of Parliament haven't been modernised since it was built.'

The Commons Commission has warned the repair bill for Parliament will top £1.6billion, saying it is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world.

A recent report by MPs revealed decades of alterations had created a complex patchwork of wiring and plumbing which was almost impossible to repair.

'Even routine tasks, such as unblocking down pipes and sewage outlets, are problematic in this environment, where pipes disappear into inaccessible voids and are entangled with other uncharted services and asbestos,' the House of Commons Commission said.

A feasibility study sent to potential contractors warned that 'small leaks or serious floods, has become a relatively common occurrence' in the Palace of Westminster.

It added: 'The Victorian drainage pipes and culverts under the Palace cope with waste water, rain water, sewage and cooking by-products on a scale for which they were not originally intended and these are pumped upwards into the London sewers at the north end of the Palace.

'The system still works, but requires continual maintenance to keep the channels clear.'

A spokesman for the House of Parliament said: 'The level of complaints relating to toilet facilities on the Parliamentary Estate has remained consistent since 2012. 

'Comments from users of the amenities are expected given that there are over one million visitors to Parliament each year and many of the 600 toilets across the Estate are in Victorian era buildings. 

'Parliament takes its responsibilities regarding health and safety seriously and all toilets are cleaned regularly and subject to routine maintenance. 

'Facilities across the Estate are also the subject of a rolling programme of refurbishment which will replace toilets as required.'
