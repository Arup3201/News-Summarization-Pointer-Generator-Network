Refit: Workers at the Marine Building at the University of Plymouth are replacing a number of windows which were fitted the wrong way around

A flagship Â£19million university building is being urgently refitted after it was discovered workers installed some of its 900 windows back-to-front.

The state-of-the-art Marine Building at Plymouth University was hailed as 'world class' when it was opened last year by the Duke of Edinburgh.

But six months on, scaffolding has gone up around the landmark research facility amid fears that hundreds of windows may have been fitted the wrong way around.

Built from about 500 tonnes of steel 
and 300 cubic metres of recycled aggregate, the five-storey building uses
solar power, natural ventilation and rainwater harvesting to minimise 
its carbon footprint.

University
officials have not disclosed how many windows have been 
installed incorrectly but they insist the bungle is not a safety issue.

A spokesman
said: 'As with many new buildings, there can be 'snagging issues' and 
in this case the contractor is undertaking some remedial work on the 
cladding around the glass panels. This is being done at no cost to the 
university.'

The Marine 
Building is home to the university's Marine Institute and houses a 
sophisticated wave tank described as the most advanced of its kind in 
the world. Engineers 
use it to test and develop the latest marine energy devices.

At the building's opening last October, Prof Martin
Attrill, director of the Marine Institute, said the 'remarkable facility will 
provide a world-class platform to support and extend the work we do.'

On its website, the university describes the Marine Building had positioned the University as a 'global centre for research, innovation and enterprise in the marine and maritime sectors.'

The facility's windows were fitted by a sub-contractor, hired by the main contractor, Leadbitter. The firm has not yet responded to a request for a comment.
