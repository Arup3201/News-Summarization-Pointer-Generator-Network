A rider performs a handstand on his bike seat in mid-air, while a different sort of rider is caught on camera just after taking a tumble from her horse.

These are just some of the dramatic images entered into a prestigious sports photography contest.

The shot of Olivia Holloway and her horse Sailor Buoy falling over won the Society of International Sport and Leisure Photographers Sporting Moments competition.

This picture of Olivia Holloway and her horse Sailor Buoy falling over during one-day eventing at the Intermediate Cross Country at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire won the Society of International Sport and Leisure Photographers Sporting Moments competition. It was taken by Roger Evans

The runner-up picture was a surfer at a man-made surfing centre in Al-Ain, Abu Dhabi - taken by Anthony Austria from the Philippines

Among the highly commended was this image of a member of the Freestyle Motocross team doing a handstand on his bike seat mid-air. Photographer Doreen Bracken took the picture at an Armed Forces Day at the 30 Signals Regiment, Gamecock Barracks, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire

It was taken by Roger Evans at the Intermediate Cross Country at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire.

Despite how the picture looks, neither horse nor rider was injured.

Mr Evans, from Shropshire, said: 'It's a photograph of "one-day eventing" - like three-day eventing as seen in the Olympics, but condensed into one day.

'The riders start with dressage, then showjumping, then finish with a cross country.

'All these competitions are run under the auspices of British Eventing. Horse and rider were OK. Personally I wouldn't publicise an image where either got badly injured.

'It's rare that riders fall, but on this particular day, a number had difficulties. The general consensus as to why this happened was that the top rail of the fence was merging with the background, so some horses only saw the rail below it and got tipped up and unseated their riders.Â 

Also highly commended were James Gunn from Halkirk, Caithness for his picture of Welsh full back Leigh Halfpenny going over his own line after just getting to the ball first to prevent Sean Lamont of Scotland scoring a try during a Six Nations game at Murrayfield

Jon Williams was highly commended for this image of Team GB snowboarder Jamie Barrow enjoying some off-piste powder in Val Thorens, France

'Lessons are always learned when this happens and the next time it is run, the fence will have been changed.'

The runner-up picture was a surfer at a man-made surfing centre in Al-Ain, Abu Dhabi by Anthony Austria from the Philippines.

He said: 'It may be man-made but it's a great place for surfers - that's why I often called my photo "Desert Surfing".

'For me, it was really hard to capture the moment because I wanted it to be like in a real beach so I look for the perfect background.'

Third place went to Kevin Rook from Kent for his picture of a bike racer at Frittenden District Grass Track, in Tunbridge Wells

Third place went to Kevin Rook from Kent for his picture of a bike racer at Frittenden District Grass Track, in Tunbridge Wells.

He said: 'To me, the image shows all the action going on in a grass track race frozen in the moment.'

Among the highly commended was this image of a member of the Freestyle Motocross team doing a handstand on his bike seat mid-air.

Photographer Doreen Bracken took the picture at an Armed Forces Day at the 30 Signals Regiment, Gamecock Barracks, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

Also highly commended were James Gunn from Halkirk, Caithness for his picture of Welsh full back Leigh Halfpenny going over his own line after just getting to the ball first to prevent Sean Lamont of Scotland scoring a try during a Six Nations game at Murrayfield.

And another highly commended shot by Jon Williams shows Team GB snowboarder Jamie Barrow enjoying some off-piste powder in Val Thorens, France.

Competition organiser Ben Jones said: 'The Society of International Sport and Leisure Photographers members covers a wide variety of sports, which include ball games to equestrian events and include such diversity as motor sports to athletics.

'Whatever the sport or the occasion, members who may be full-time professionals or aspiring photographers cover the event.

'The winning image was chosen because of the superbly caught moment of when the rider came unseated.'
