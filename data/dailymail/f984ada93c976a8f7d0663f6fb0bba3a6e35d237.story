A boy battling a rare cancer who created a Ninja Turtle mask to feel strong during radiotherapy got a surprise early gift of all his favourite superheroes.

Harley Renshaw, five, is fighting cancer in his kidney, neck, lung and bones, and made his Ninja Turtle mask to help him face the gruelling treatment.

And the brave boy recently got a phone call from Los Angeles - from two of the actors who play characters in the TV show.

Makes him feel strong: Harley Renshaw, who is battling a rare cancer, created a Ninja Turtle mask to wear during radiotherapy

Hospital staff were amazed when the youngster, from Stretford, asked if he could decorate the protective medical mask that holds him still while having his treatment. 

The story of his bravery recently made headlines around the world and now staff at children's TV channel Nickelodeon have sent Harley a box full of Ninja Turtle presents for Christmas. 

Harley's father Oliver, 25, said: 'Nickelodeon have been fantastic. They've absolutely spoiled Harley. We've had to go and buy a huge toy box just for his Ninja Turtle toys.'

Oliver added: 'It's been really overwhelming. Harley is doing well and we're really pleased that we will be spending Christmas at home.' 

Oliver and mother Stacey, 23, were given Harley's devastating diagnosis after taking him to see a doctor with a pain in his tummy.

He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare and aggressive childhood cancer - and is now taking part in a clinical trial funded by Cancer Research UK at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.

Harley has also had 14 days of radiotherapy at The Christie. His story came to light after he was awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards, which acknowledge the unique challenges faced by youngsters who encounter cancer. 

Alison Barbuti, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'Harley's story has helped raise a huge amount of awareness about the Little Star Awards and lots of other children who have faced a cancer diagnosis will have been nominated for the award or readers inspired to donate to our research as a result of his bravery.

Tina McCann, Managing Director at Nickelodeon UK and Ireland said: 'All of us at Nickelodeon were moved by Harley's story and we wanted to help to bring additional Turtle Power to his life. 

'We are so pleased to hear that he likes the Turtle action figures that we sent over and that we were able to coordinate a call between Harley and two of the actors from the series.

'We hope that Harley and his family have a brilliant Christmas and that 2015 brings them every happiness.'
