Probe: Police have closed an inquiry into claims that Princess Diana was murdered by an SAS hit squad

The investigation into claims that Princess Diana was murdered by an SAS hit squad has been closed.

Scotland Yard conducted the probe over an allegation made by an anonymous soldier that emerged at a trial of SAS man Danny Nightingale for illegal possession of a gun. 

Relatives of ‘Soldier N’ said that he had claimed the car crash in Paris in 1997 in which Princess Diana was killed was caused by SAS assassins.

He believed that special forces 
agents had shone a light into the eyes of Diana's driver Henri Paul - leading to him losing control of the car and hitting a pillar in a tunnel in Paris.

The soldier's claims led to the inquiry into the Princess's death being reopened.

However, the Metropolitan Police is now in the process of 'concluding' the investigation.

A police spokesman said: ‘We are in the process of drawing up conclusions, which will be communicated to the families and interested parties before any further comment can be made.’

An inquest in 2008 found that Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross negligence’ of Mr Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who had been drinking.

However, the driver’s mother Gisele said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in the French underpass.

She had welcomed the investigation into the SAS's alleged role in Diana's death.

Speaking earlier this year, Mrs Paul, 83, said: ‘We believe there was a plot to kill the Princess that terrible night in August 1997.

‘We know in our hearts that our son was murdered and we still live with the hope that one day the truth will be known.’
