A football-loving, 77-year-old Nebraska woman refused to let her failing health keep her from rooting for her favorite football team Saturday.

Yvonne Stahmer and her 81-year-old husband Leonard have held season tickets to Nebraska Cornhuskers football games since 1962 and, having earned the name 'Grandma-Go-Big-Red,' Yvonne's team spirit hasn't wavered despite her failing health, according to LiveWellNebraska.

The Stahmers have been to nearly every home game since obtaining their first season pass up until almost 10 years ago when back problems, arthritis, and Parkinson's Disease began making it difficult for Yvonne to attend, LWN reports.

One more: Yvonne told her family she wanted to attend one more Nebraska Cornhuskers football game before 'i go to my maker'

Yvonne, who now lives in a nursing home, refuses to let her health issues keep her from her beloved Huskers. Yvonne told her family that she wants to attend one more Husker home game before 'I go to my maker,' LWN reports.

Her wish was granted.

The Omaha Nursing and Rehabilitation Center exchanged the couple's season tickets for handicapped seating and on Saturday, Yvonne was wheeled into Memorial Stadium, wearing all red, by her husband and a nursing home aide. 

Just years ago, Yvonne could be seen jumping up and down, hooting and hollering, but the Parkinson's Disease has left Yvonne with little movement in her arms and none in her legs.

The disease also makes it difficult for her to speak.

Hundreds: Yvonne  and her husband had been to hundreds of Huskers games and Yvonne even wore radio headphones during the games to listen to the play-by-play

LWN reports that Yvonne was a serious Huskers fan. She and her husband had been to hundreds of Huskers games and Yvonne even wore radio headphones during the games to listen to the play-by-play.

Though other things have changed, this hasn't. At the Nebraska-Purdue game Saturday, Yvonne asked her aide for her headphones so she could listen to the play-by-play as she had years before.

LWN reports that Yvonne and Leonard sat just 30 feet from the end zone, separated from the players by only a fence. 

Leonard pulled a red 'Huskers' blanket snug around his wife. He held her hand and bounced it gently on his lap as the marching band began to play.
