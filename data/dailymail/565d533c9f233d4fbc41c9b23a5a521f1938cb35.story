James Rollinson has been jailed after he fell asleep in a stolen car outside a home he had just raided

A burglar has been jailed after he was caught sleeping by police - in a stolen car outside a home he had just raided.

James Rollinson dropped off in the back seat after stealing jewellery, a games console, a laptop and a camera from a woman's home in Sedgley, West Midlands, on December 23 last year.

The 20-year-old had taken the bagful of stolen property back to his own home before returning to the house and passing out in the car.

Rollinson admitted burglary and was jailed for 12 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday

The court heard a neighbour called police - who found Rollinson asleep in the back of the parked car.

Jailing him, Recorder Denis Desmond said: 'You took her property to your home, you came back and you got into her car and then you fell asleep.'

Prosecutor Alka Brigue told the court Rollinson targeted the house after seeing Miss Goodyear drinking in a pub in Sedgley.

The crook knew her home was empty and smashed a side window with a brick to gain access.

The missing goods - apart from the camera - were later recovered from Rollinson's home in Sedgley and returned to Miss Goodyear.

Defending Rollinson, Jas Mann said the burglar was 'tanked up' after a heavy drinking session and he had little recollection of the burglary.

Mr Mann added: 'He was not in a sober, sensible and rational state of mind.Â 

'It was because he was intoxicated that he got involved in this enterprise.'

Friends of Rollinson have written on his Facebook page about giving him a 'big sess' when he is released from prison.
