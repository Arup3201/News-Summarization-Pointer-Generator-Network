A former Vietnam-era Army helicopter that was given to a police department for free has ended up costing the force more than $2million, it has emerged.

The 42-year-old Bell Kiowa chopper was one of two hand-me-downs taken by the Newark Police Department to help track carjackers and fugitives.

One was to be flown and the other used for spare parts.

But public records have emerged that show the cash-strapped force has spent more than $2million on refurbishing, maintaining and operating the aircraft.

The revelations are likely to anger many in the city after then-Mayor Cory Booker was forced to sack 167 police officers in 2010 over mounting budget problems.

This Vietnam-era Bell Kiowa helicopter has ended up costing Newark Police Department more than $2million to refurbish, maintain and operate since it was handed to the force for free from the U.S. Army

Documents obtained by NJ Advance Media show maintenance contracts alone approved by the Newark City Council have totalled $1.13million in the past five years.

This included a $27,412 invoice to strip, apply corrosion coating and paint the aircraft, plus new rotor blades cost that $143,386.

Other costs include annual storage and hangar fees of $3,600 and insurance premiums of $30,000 a year.

Then there was is $961,000 that has been spent on pilot salaries, it was reported by NJ.com.

Anthony Ambrose, the then chief of police and the city's acting police director, defended the decision to acquire the helicopters, saying it was effective in tackling crime.

He said: 'A helicopter can reduce the crime rate by 7 to 14 per cent. The downside is the cost. 

'But if we only stopped carjackings, we would be getting our money's worth.' 

Documents show the initial aircraft - given the call sign Able-1 - was delivered to the city in 2005 from the U.S. Army base at Ft Drum, NY. 

The figures will also raise new questions about the hidden costs of the controversial U.S. Department of Defense program which came under fire last year after police in Ferguson, Missouri (above), responded to demonstrators with armored combat vehicles and tactical armor over the shooting of a black teenager

A second one, to be stripped for spare parts, was received in 2007.

Able-1 was grounded in 2010 due to budget cuts, but reintroduced a year later after a sharp rise in crime. 

A spokesman for Newark police did not respond to questions about the helicopter or its total cost to the city.

NJ.com notes that the figures will also raise new questions about the hidden costs of the controversial U.S. Department of Defense program has provided billions in surplus military gear to police forces across the country.

The program was criticised last year after police in Ferguson, Missouri, responded to demonstrators with armored combat vehicles and tactical armor following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer.
