She became the biggest star on TV at just 18 months old, but today, 'Baby' Jessica McClure is a stay-at-home mom of two.

Now Jessica Morales, the 26-year-old is married and still lives near the site of her dramatic rescue on October 16, 1987 - 25 years ago today.

Millions around the world were glued to their televisions and praying for her safety as dozens of rescuers worked night and day to save Jessica McClure from inside an abandoned well.

Rescue: Jessica McClure is held by paramedic Robert O'Donnell, who killed himself in 1995. Now a mother-of-two, Jessica, right, says she is proud of her scars and can't remember the ordeal

During her 58-hour ordeal, 
kind-hearted viewers even donated money to help the little girl recover,
 which was placed into a trust fund.

She collected the fund's $800,000 on her 25th birthday last year.

Jessica intended to put the money towards a college fund for her two children - Simon and Sheyenne.

She is now married to Daniel Morales and is a contented stay-at-home mother of two, looking after her kids and living less than two miles from the site that made her famous.

The mother has no memory of being wedged in the pipe or the 15 operations that followed her ordeal, according to her father.

A scar from her hairline to the bridge of her nose is still visible where her head rubbed against the wall of the well.

Rescue: Scores of rescuers gather at the eight-inch opening to a well shaft in this October 15, 1987 photo, in Midland, Texas. Trapped, injured and alone, was 18-month-old Jessica McClure

She also lost a toe to gangrene because one leg was pinned above her head in the underground shaft.

These days, she and her husband run a mobile car- and truck-washing business out of their home.

In October 1987, her father Lewis 'Chip' McClure and his wife, Reba 'Cissy' McClure, were poor teenagers struggling to make ends meet during the depths of the oil bust.

While visiting her sister, Jessica's mother left her in the yard while she went to answer the phone.

Moments later, Jessica came upon the 8-inch well opening and fell inside.

Her plight captivated an immense television audience. Alone and 22 feet below ground, Baby Jessica sang about Winnie the Pooh.

It was 'a nightmare that got worse and worse,' her father recalled in an interview last year.

When rescuers finally brought her to the surface, her head was bandaged.

She was covered with dirt and bruises, and her right palm was stuck to her face.

A
 1997 poll taken by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
 found that coverage of Princess Diana's death earlier that year was 
rivalled only by Jessica's rescue in worldwide attention over the 
previous decade.

At the time of the accident, sympathetic strangers showered the family with teddy bears, home-made gifts, cards and cash.

Bank documents show the couple's home was purchased with help from the trust.

Carroll Thomas, Midland's mayor in 
1987, said the city's reputation benefited from the rescue. Most people 
around the world had not heard of Midland back then.

‘They
 had a good feeling about Midland because they read about it and saw how
 hard we were working,’ he said. ‘It went on so long.’

About
 three years after the TV cameras left, Chip and Cissy divorced. Both 
have since remarried.

In 2002, she told Ladies Home Journal that talk of her 'incident' bored her, and she took pride in her scars.

'I'm proud of them,' she said. 'I have them because I survived.'

In the same interview, she disclosed 
that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, which was diagnosed just 
before she entered the 10th grade.

The ordeal 'couldn't cage me then, why should it cage me now?’ she told NBC in June 2007.

Even the family doesn't talk about it when they're together, McClure said.

'It seems a little surreal,' he said. 
'In some ways, it seems familiar and recent. Other times, it seems like 
someone else a long time ago.'

Friends in high places: Despite the international fame she could have embraced, Jessica - seen here with then president George Bush in 1989 - has only spoken publically about the accident three times

Jessica's low-key personality has helped her adjust over the years, her father said.

Others could never recover.

In 1995, Robert O'Donnell, the paramedic clutching Jessica as they emerged from the well in a famous 1987 photo, killed himself while battling post-traumatic stress.

Andy Glasscock, the police officer who was one of the first to the scene after Jessica fell down the well, pleaded guilty in 2004 to raping a woman he had drugged, as well as child pornography charges, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Throughout Jessica's childhood, both parents worked to give her a normal life, her father has said.

In
 her later years of high school, she lived briefly with her father in 
Tyler. In 2004, she graduated from Greenwood High School, near Midland.

Mr
 McClure said he and his ex-wife allowed their daughter to decide 
whether to talk to the media once she became old enough. She has spoken 
publicly just three times since the accident.
