Dozens of people took to Twitter to voice their outrage at Ken Brown's comment

The BBC was last night facing another sports commentary controversy after veteran golf commentator Ken Brown was accused of making a racist comment on the British Open.

As Tiger Woods and Lee Westwood prepared to start the 12th hole, Mr Brown – who represented Europe in the Ryder Cup five times during the 1970s and 1980s – said: ‘This fairway runs like an Ethiopian chicken... it just runs.’

Last night dozens of people took to Twitter to voice their disgust at the outburst.

Shaun Murphy, English 2005 world snooker champion, wrote: ‘Did Ken Brown just say that? This fairway runs like an Ethiopian chicken? What does that mean?

The snooker player later added: ‘funny way to announce his retirement I thought’. 

The BBC’s Wimbledon presenter John Inverdale was this month forced to make an apology to the 2013 women’s champion Marion Bartoli after saying she ‘was never going to be a looker’. 

There were 674 complaints, sparking Culture Secretary Maria Miller to call for further action against Inverdale. 

BBC Director-General Tony Hall last week branded Inverdale’s insensitive comments ‘unacceptable’. It  is unclear whether Mr Brown will be asked to apologise.

The 56-year-old has worked for the BBC for 20 years since retiring from golf in his 30s. The BBC did not respond to  a request for comment.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Ken apologises for his comments and any offence caused.'
