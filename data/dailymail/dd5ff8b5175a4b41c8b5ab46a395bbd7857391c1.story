Poachers and bush meat hunters are putting some species of giraffe in danger of extinction and the overall population has dropped by 40 per cent in the last 15 years, conservationists have warned. 

There are now fewer than 80,000 giraffes in Africa, 60,000 less than the 140,000 recorded 15-years ago, according to alarming new research. 

'Many of the threats to rhinos and elephants are the same for giraffes,' Dr Noelle Kumpel, from the Zoological Society of London told Mail Online. 'The threats are local. It's loss of habitat and increasingly it's poaching, but not for the international trade, it's bush meat hunting.'

The prominence of giraffes in zoos has disguised the fact some giraffes are in danger of extinction.  There are now fewer than 80,000 giraffes in Africa, 60,000 less than the 140,000 recorded 15-years ago

Poachers kill giraffes in the wild because they are easy to hunt and provide a lot of meat

Trapped in a snare, a dead giraffe lies prostrate with its head removed. In certain parts of Africa the heads and bone marrow from the creatures are prized as a cure for Aids 

She added: 'There's a difference between poaching for elephants and rhinos for example. But with increasing social problems like poverty or the displacement of people, it is becoming more prevalent.' 

'Of course some parts of Africa bush meat is part of the staple diet of some, but really this is a bigger issue of food security.'  

Poachers also view the giraffe as an easy source of meat, she said, adding that giraffe would be an easy target for the armed gangs hunting for ivory. 

'Traditionally they get caught in snares by the poorer local people just looking for food,' she said. 'But those hunting higher profile animals have the firearms and automatic weapons which make it simple to kill the noticeable giraffe.'  

Their prominence in zoos has disguised the fact that there is very little conservation effort is made with them, she added. 

While giraffe heads and bones can fetch a high price in Tanzania, where some people believe that their bone marrow can cure Aids, many are killed for their meat which is both sweet and popular. 

Elephant poachers, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where ivory is traded for ammunition, arms and food, are known to favor the creatures. 

It is then shipped on to China and Vietnam where despite an international ban, demand for the bone remains high.

'Being delicious is one thing, but there's also a bucket-load of meat, and they're not difficult to hunt,' said Dr Julian Fennessy, the world's only full-time giraffe conservationist. 

'People love giraffes but they're taken for granted,' he added. 'People assume that they're everywhere. They see them on branding and postcards and think they are okay. But the decline of their natural habitat has seen their numbers fall dramatically.'

However,  some of the sub-species of giraffe are so rare that they could soon be classified as a species in their own right. 

If this happened, the West African giraffe would instantly become the most endangered large mammal in Africa. 

The Giraffe Conservation Foundation estimates that only 300 remain on the whole continent.  

The Rothschild giraffe would also be at risk, according to the Red List, the wildlife conservation inventory compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

But despite the dangers a lack of resources prevented a thorough assessment of the entire giraffe population was not even attempted in 2010 the last time they were surveyed, according to Dr Fennessy, who is also a director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. 

However, along with 14 colleagues Dr Fennessy has spent the past year collating the numbers of giraffe and the findings will be presented next year. 

'The is quite a bit of attention paid to elephants and rhinos but the giraffe is iconic to Africa,' said Dr Fennessy. 'But no one has really paid attention to giraffes and they are not really in as good condition as we thought. Unless something is done soon, we will lose some of these glorious creatures before we even know it.'
