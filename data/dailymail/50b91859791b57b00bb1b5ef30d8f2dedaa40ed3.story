A mother died of a broken heart after her daughter was stillborn, her husband has claimed.

Darren Clift, 41, said his wife Lindsay was so devastated by the death of their daughter that she died just five hours after giving birth to their first child, Katy May.

Mrs Clift, 29, from Bilston in the West Midlands, was due to give birth last month.

Lindsay Clift died five hours after her daughter Katy May was stillborn. Her husband Darren believes she died of a broken heart

But when the baby still hadn’t arrived 12 days after the due date, Mr Clift took his wife to Wolverhampton’s New Cross Hospital to be induced.

Tragically, doctors induced labour but discovered Katy May had died in the womb.

Shortly afterwards Mrs Clift she passed out and never regained consciousness.

Despite desperate attempts to revive Mrs Clift, who worked as a mobile hairdresser, she died five hours later.

Mr Clift said: 'There was no reason to think anything was going to go wrong that day. She walked in there fit and healthy.

The couple had wanted to start a family since they met seven years ago. They discovered they were expecting their first child after marrying last May

'She seemed to just pass out. To my 
mind, once Katy May had gone it was almost as if Lindsay wanted to go as
well, to look after the baby. She wanted a baby so much.

'In my view she was so heartbroken 
that she wanted to be with the baby. This was a longed-for baby, it was 
mine and Lindsay's first.

'For them to not find an instant 
cause of death, it sort of strengthens my feeling, even if it's 
medically nonsense, that she made the decision to go - I was there, I 
saw the fight go out of her.

'We went in there hand in hand to become a three and very quickly found that Katy May had passed away, and then Lindsay.

'I still can't believe how we got to this.

'The hospital were brilliant, they did everything they could.

'It probably sounds cheesy given recent events but I called her my angel for the last few months.

Just five hours after her daughter's death, Mrs Clift, who was fit and healthy, inexplicably passed away

'She touched so many people, she was 
just lovely, so many people have got in touch to pay tribute to her 
since she passed away and that's some comfort.

Mr Clift paid tribute to his ‘beautiful, stunning and warm’ wife.

The pair met in 2005 at his place of work before marrying in May last year in Wolverhampton.

‘Lindsay
was just a warm and easy person to be with,' he said. 'There was never a
bad patch. We just wanted the same things in life.’

The exact cause of death is not yet known.

An inquest into Mrs Clift's death on September 26 has been opened and adjourned.

Her funeral service and cremation will take place on Friday.
