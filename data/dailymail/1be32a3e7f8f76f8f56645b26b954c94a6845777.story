Jack Cork is poised to become the eighth player to leave Southampton this summer as he closes on a move to Crystal Palace on Thursday.

Southampton have raised more than £95million with the sales of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Rickie Lambert and Billy Sharp, who signed for Leeds United on a two year deal on Wednesday.

On his way: Southampton have accepted a £3m offer from Crystal Palace for Jack Cork

Cork had one year left on contract and talks over a new deal had failed to produce an agreement. 

Fearing they would lose him for nothing next summer, Southampton have accepted a fee of around £3million from Palace.

They rejected a similar offer from Swansea in January for Cork, while West Bromwich Albion and QPR had also shown interest in the 25-year-old midfielder, who joined from Chelsea for £800,000 in 2011.

Interest: Southampton have agreed a £12.5m fee with Hull City for striker Shane Long

Southampton, however, have agreed a £12.5m fee with Hull City for striker Shane Long and are close to finalising the £6m transfer of Florin Gardos from Steaua Bucharest. 

Long's fee is set to hand his former club West Bromwich Albion around £600,000 as part of the deal that took him to Hull in January.

Southampton sales may not have finished yet though as Tottenham remain keen on midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin and striker Jay Rodriguez, even though the latter won't be fit again until October following his cruciate injury.
