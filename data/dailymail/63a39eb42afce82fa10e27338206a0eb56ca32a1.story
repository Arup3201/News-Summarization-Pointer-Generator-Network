Suki Waterhouse caught the world's attention as the hot blonde model on Bradley Cooper's arm.

As well as dating the A-list actor, the 20-year-old English rose has smouldered for numerous high fashion campaigns and is even rumoured to be the new face of Burberry.

And it seems that good looks run in the family.

The Vogue favourite's little sister has just been unveiled as the face of a new modelling campaign and looks set to give her big sister a run for her money in the posing stakes.

Watch out, Suki! Immy Waterhouse, whose sister Suki is already a big name on the fashion scene, has just been unveiled as the new face of George at Asda's G21 Talent label

Immy Waterhouse is the stunning star of a new modelling campaign for George at Asda’s G21 Talent label, a collection of clothing designed by young designers handpicked from Graduate Fashion Week.

All eyes may have been on Suki and her Hollywood beau Bradley of late, but these new shots prove that 19-year-old Immy is hot on the modelling heels of her older sister.

With her similar blonde tresses, blue eyes and sultry pout, the young model has already been dubbed 'fashion's new hotty'.

As a fan of print hero Mary Katrantzou, Immy was won over by Frankie’s bold designs.

She said: 'It was all so fun and vibrant and I loved the printed playsuit and shirt'.

Immy follows in the footsteps of presenter and model Laura Whitmore, who has previously served as a clothes horse for the brand.

She may only be in her teens, but Immy is already carving out quite the modelling career.

She has previously starred in campaigns for Urban Outfitters and Coast (a brand which Suki has also modelled for), and judging by these new snaps, she is certainly one to watch.
