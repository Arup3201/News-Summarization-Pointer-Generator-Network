Mario Balotelli is an overpaid penalty taker who no longer takes penalties.

Brendan Rodgers thinks differently, and he will need more than a massive dose of good luck to come out of this one looking clever. The Liverpool boss survived the Luis Suarez controversies with his reputation not just intact but enhanced. However, his faith in Balotelli could soil that managerial CV.

It seems all the Italy forward has to do at the moment is run around and make a few tackles and he gets nine out of 10 from most Liverpool fans.

I’m sure they also love social media videos of him inhaling helium and singing Liverpool songs. At least he hasn’t bitten anyone.

Those supporters seem grateful to have Balotelli at Anfield, when in truth, he should be thankful for another chance.

AC Milan were so desperate to get rid of the striker they accepted only £16million for him. That desperation became obvious when they replaced him with Fernando Torres.

Liverpool shouldn’t be dealing with bargain strikers nobody else wants.

Balotelli’s record with managers isn’t great. Jose Mourinho didn’t want him, describing him as 'unmanageable'. Even Roberto Mancini, who admitted that he viewed Balotelli like 'one of his children', lost patience and sold him after the pair had a scrap on the training ground following another Balotelli transgression. 

You've got to respect Rodgers for taking on the challenge, but it’s another potential problem he faces in a season which already promised to be tough.

On Saturday in the derby, Balotelli didn’t impact the game significantly. In fact he missed a sitter that would have guaranteed Liverpool three points. Tim Howard made himself big and made the save, but the keeper should have been given no chance – that’s what a truly top level striker would have done.

But that is airbrushed out of the Liverpool fans’ reports of the game, they prefer instead to focus on how hard he worked. Is that enough to keep them happy?

This boy in a man’s body has had so many chances in football that mere hard work should be the bare minimum he owes Liverpool for their lifeline this summer. He’s a lucky fella.

And what about this so-called hard work being done by Balotelli? He does a fraction of the work Suarez used to get through, and obviously his career goal record is vastly inferior.

Let’s wait and see what it is that Balotelli brings to the Liverpool party. A couple of stuttering shootout spot kicks against Middlesbrough, and a goal against Champions League also-rans are a mediocre return so far. It’s early days, but points are being dropped.

What is even more inexplicable is Rodgers’ decision to effectively end Rickie Lambert’s top flight career. Despite doing well for Southampton and England last year, Lambert has yet to start a Premier League game for his new club, with Balotelli preferred up front.

Managers who have put their faith in the Italian in the past have been let down. Rodgers is setting himself up for a fall – he has put an extraordinary amount of faith in this player, and it would be a shame if Balotelli didn’t repay this faith in full. But will he?

Maybe Balotelli would be wise to reflect on the words of a true Liverpool legend. Kenny Dalglish said this after Mario saw red at Anfield in 2011: 'Sometimes if you look in the mirror you get the answer.'

Rodgers can only hope and pray Balotelli has looked in the mirror and asked the right questions. If the striker doesn’t get it right at Anfield, the manager will have to provide a few answers.
