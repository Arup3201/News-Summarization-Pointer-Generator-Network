A six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft.

Baraka Cosmas was sleeping at his mother's house in Kipenda, Tanzania, on Saturday night when a group of men stormed in and grabbed him, police said.

They beat up his mother before using machetes to cut off the boy's right hand.

The latest assault comes days after Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a 'disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation'. 

He said: 'I believe that with close co-operation between the government and society, we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame.' 

A police spokesman said: 'The gangsters got hold of the victim's mother, Prisca Shaaban, and beat her severely after she refused to hand over the boy.

'The assailants later used machetes to cut off the boy's right palm and walked out.' 

Albino body parts are thought to sell for around $600 (£397) with an entire corpse fetching nearly $75,000 (£49,685), a UN expert said. 

At least 75 albinos have died in the region since 2000. 

Earlier in the week four people were sentenced to death for the murder of 22-year-old albino woman Zawadi Mangidu.

Tanzanian police on Monday banned a planned demonstration by the Tanzania Albinism Society in the country's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, citing security reasons.

But Kikwete has said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings. 

The murders have been concentrated in the gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country's Lake Victoria, where superstitious beliefs are rampant.

Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. 

It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400 often as a result of inbreeding, experts said. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. 

Albinos are seen as curses, or 'ghosts' who can be wiped off the face of the earth in many parts of Tanzania. 

Families are often told to kill the children at birth. Yet, conversely, their body parts are highly prized.

Witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches, power and success, if used in potions, while a UN report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets, or would bury them where they are drilling for gold.

Fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish.

Children are particularly vulnerable - their innocence is highly valued and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them.

Most of the time, limbs are taken but a recent report noted that there have been cases where victims were beheaded, or had their genitals, ears, and bits of skin removed.

Tongues can also be cut out or the eyes and the heart gouged out.

Other types of attacks reported include rape for healing purposes.

Possibly, most shockingly, some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed, the more potent the charm.
