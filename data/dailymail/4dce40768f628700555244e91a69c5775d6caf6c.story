Students in Wisconsin have taken to social media to blast Michelle Obama for their Thanksgiving themed lunches that feature a brown mystery mush.

The brown paste was served at Richland Center High School in Wisconsin and students earlier this month and they didn't find the meal to be especially appetizing.

A student named Hunter Whitney posted photos of the brown mush and a single red apple along with the caption, 'Had a very #healthylunch today. The apple definitely made up for the 'mystery mush' #ThanksMichelleObama.'

Healthy eating?: Students at a Wisconsin high school posted pics along with criticism of their supposedly healthier Thanksgiving themed school lunches 

Sarcasm: Students sarcastically thanked Michelle Obama as they posted photos of their school lunches 

Thanksgiving?: Students are less than thankful for their school's interpretation of healthy school lunches

Another student named Marissa Garret tweeted, 'So disappointed in this modified Thanksgiving lunch.. @MichelleObama #ThanksMichelleObama'

Along with her caption came a photo displaying canned green beans along with several other brown clumps of mystery food.

Students speculated on of the brown clumps might be a sort of rice substitute--a poor one. 

A student named Maya Wuertz posted her recent Thanksgiving inspired lunch at Austin High School in Minnesota, reports Eagnews.org.

The lunch features soggy string beans and other sorts of clumped together  mystery items.

The Thanksgiving lunches weren't the only ones that were criticized. Even popular chicken finger Friday was reduced to a plate with three measly chicken strips. 

A student named Malachai Dobbins quipped, 'It's chicken finger Friday! Oh wait no it's not!'

The new lunches comply with food regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA.

USDA regulations now require foods in the school lunch line to be healthier.

Chicken Finger what?: This student misses celebrating the coveted chicken finger Friday at his school 

Disappointed: Student Melissa Garrett was left with a grumbling belly and a hot temper at lunchtime 

Still hungry: Students posted photos of the small amount of food they receive at school lunches 

Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools.

Concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt.

Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat.

School nutritionists and food service workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales.

Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards.

Mrs Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'
