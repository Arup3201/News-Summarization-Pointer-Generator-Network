It's widely thought that Spanish referees are quicker than their English counterparts to point to the spot - and Real Madrid's Marcelo did nothing to dispel that myth with this shocking dive. 

The European champions got off to a less than ideal start after Edu Albacar gave the visitors the lead at the Bernabeu from the penalty spot. 

But after Gareth Bale had equalised for Madrid, Marcelo took matters into his own hands by chucking himself on the floor under no challenge from Pedro Mosquera.

Referee Carlos Clos Gomez somehow judged the 'contact' to be worthy of a penalty 

Referee Carlos Clos Gómez amazingly pointed to the spot, and Cristiano Ronaldo did the honours to give Madrid the lead. 

Ronaldo doubled his tally shortly afterwards to make it 3-1. 

But the Portuguese legend wasn't finished there, bagging another two goals to complete an incredible four-goal haul.
