Ed Miliband is now as unpopular as Gordon Brown, with a new poll show more than six out of ten voters do not like him.

His public satisfaction has plunged to its lowest level since he became leader, according to the Ipsos MORI survey.

It found 63 per cent of people say they do not like Mr Miliband and only 30 per cent like him, following a summer of criticism from within his own party.

Last October only 56 per cent of the public said they disliked him, from a high of 51 per cent in January 2011.

Meanwhile David Cameron - who is consistently more popular than the Conservative party, while for Mr Miliband it is the other way round - is liked by 43 per cent of those polled by Ipsos MORI.

The Prime Minister disliked by 52 per cent, while Nick Clegg is slightly more popular than the Labour leader, with 57 per cent disliking him and 33 per cent liking him.

Mr Miliband’s personal rating compares with Gordon Brown’s in 2009, although at the height of the former prime minister’s unpopularity just one in seven people thought he was fit for office.

The Labour leader's attempt at a political 
re-launch backfired yesterday - as he was pelted with eggs while meeting

Head to head: David Cameron is ahead of Ed Miliband on net satisfaction, while Nick Clegg trails on -35

It piles pressure on the Labour leader, who has been stung by accusation from his own MPs that he is not coming up with policies with attract voters and Labour’s message is ‘incoherent’.

While the poll found only 23 per cent of Tory voters said they do not know what David Cameron stands for, 40 per cent of Labour voters feel confused about Mr Miliband, while Mr Clegg not far behind with 38 per cent.

However the Labour party are still ahead in the polls, clinging on to a double digit lead on 40 per cent, with the Conservatives up one on 30 per cent, the Lib Dems remaining on 10 per cent, and Ukip down one point to 11 per cent.

Labour is also still the most ‘liked’ party, and the Conservatives most ‘disliked’.

Doubts: Worryingly for David Cameron, more than half of people say they do not know what he stands for. Ipsos MORI surveyed 1,007 British adults from August 10-12

Gideon Skinner, Ipsos MORI’s head of political research, said: ‘The challenge facing all party leaders is getting their ideas across to the public.

‘It’s most acute for Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, even among their own supporters, and isn’t helped by their low personal ratings. Despite that Labour have held onto their lead.’

A senior Labour source said: ‘The fact that Labour has a ten-point lead in this poll shows that people across the country faced with a cost of living crisis are increasingly seeking an alternative to this out-of-touch Government.’

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary is the most senior figure to weigh in over Labour’s woes, saying his boss needed to ‘shout louder’ and come up with a vision for the economy or Labour would lose the next election.

Former minister Chris Mullin accused him of lacking a ‘strong coherent message.’

Mr Miliband slapped down his critics this week as he returned from holiday, saying: ‘If we take this area of the cost of living crisis, have Labour got answers? Absolutely we’ve got answers.

‘On rail fares, on energy prices, on payday lenders and on a fairer tax system, they’re all the things I believe the country wants and that’s what we’re going to be talking about in the coming months.’
