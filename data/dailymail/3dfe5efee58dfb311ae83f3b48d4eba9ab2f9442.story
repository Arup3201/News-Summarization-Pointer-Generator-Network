An African-American man was shot dead today by St Louis police officers after allegedly robbing a convenience store with a knife.

A large crowd gathered behind police tape as news of the fatal shooting spread, raising their arms and chanting, 'hands up, don't shoot', a refrain which has become the war-cry for protesters on the streets of nearby Ferguson following the cop killing of Michael Brown.  

A St Louis police chief  waded into the crowd on Tuesday to explain what had happened in an effort to calm tensions following the second police shooting in the city in ten days.

The suspect, 23, charged at officers  waving the knife when he was killed at 12.30pm,  Police Chief Sam Dotson said. 

There are now fears that the shooting could cause tensions to boil over again tonight in Ferguson. On Monday 78 arrests were made, the majority for people refusing to disperse when ordered by police.

Ferguson's leaders urged residents on Tuesday to stay home after dark to 'allow peace to settle in' where the fatal shooting of 18-year-old  Brown has sparked nightly clashes between protesters and police.

Today's shooting took place outside the Six Stars Market, four miles from Ferguson which has been rocked by unrest over last week's cop shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. 

No officers were injured in today's incident. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The suspect stole two energy drinks, according to KMOV, left the store but then returned to take a pastry. 

Fox reported that the man, who was behaving 'erratically', got into a dispute with the owner who called 911.

When police arrived, the man reportedly shouted: 'Shoot me now, kill me now.'

The 23-year-old was holding the knife in an overhand grip, the police chief said today.

The officers left their patrol car without their weapons drawn and warned the man multiple times to drop the weapon, the police chief said. 

However when the man charged at them with the knife raised and was within three or four feet, they opened fire and killed him.

The officers who shot the man were placed on administrative duty pending an investigation into the death. 

Chief Dotson waded into the crowd today to share more details about the police's initial investigation, in an apparent effort to calm tensions. 

Bystanders asked why the man was not Tasered, according to a reporter for Msnbc.

Tasers are not standard issue for the St Louis Police Department, Christopher Hayes reported. 

A large crowd had already gathered at the scene of a convenience store shooting in North St Louis on Tuesday, ten days after another cop killed a teenager four miles away in Ferguson

A heavy police presence was on the scene cordoning off the area with crime scene tape and blocking intersections with patrol vehicles.

The cop shooting on Tuesday comes ten days after a police officer in a St Louis suburb shot dead an unarmed teenager.

Officer Darren Wilson fired at least six shots at 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9 in Ferguson, killing him in the street. 

The National Guard arrived in Ferguson Monday but kept its distance from the streets during another night of unrest.

Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse.

 Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades. 

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said bottles and Molotov cocktails were thrown from the crowd and that some officers had come under heavy gunfire. 

Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from the reported gunfire.
