From pop art to hand-painted leather, monochrome strips and even Seventies fringing, spring is all about the wacky handbag — and this season you’re spoiled for choice.

‘Nowadays your bag doesn’t necessarily have to match what you’re wearing,’ says celebrity stylist Alex Longmore. ‘There are no rules any more — there is so much diversity and so many extremes. Matching handbags and shoes are over. This is the season to go crazy with accessories.’

But however out-there the bag, you’ll be able to carry it off because clothes are more minimalist and more relaxed than ever. Here is our pick of the best . . .

POP ART

Eau de Parfum clutch at Next for £28

By far the biggest handbag trend for spring, this encompasses everything from £1,285 slogan bags at Edie Parker to speech-bubble-shaped clutches at Sophia Webster, £340.

On the High Street, there’s the Eau de Parfum clutch at Next for £28, which looks like an upmarket bottle of perfume, or a comic-book-style box clutch, bearing the word ‘Crunch!’, by Skinny Dip at lux-fix.com for £35.

‘If you want to go for the pop art bags, pick a clutch bag, which is more of a nod to the trend,’ says Alex Longmore. ‘This will brighten up a simple black dress and make it look on-trend and fun. Stay away from pairing it with anything too wacky. These bags are brilliant for pepping up a conservative outfit.’

If all of that sounds scary, Anya Hindmarch has some of the subtlest takes on this look, using more chic, muted colours to tone down the kitsch. One bag has a smiley face perforated into soft leather, £950, while another pale blue bag has a pair of cartoon eyes on the flap, £595.

If that sounds a bit expensive, Anya Hindmarch also has padded leather stickers for £35 that you can apply yourself, including weather icons, smiley faces, eyes, letters and a victory sign.

FRINGE BENEFITS

Saint Laurent Fringe Small Bucket Bag

The fad for fringing is another look to approach with care. Part of this season’s Seventies revival, long suede fringes appear on slouchy, brown hobo bags and can, depending on how you wear them, look boho-cool, rock-chick-radical — or just hippy-horrific.

These appeared on Etro’s catwalk, which featured Native American-style beading, and cost more than £2,000, while fringing was on clothes from Celine to Alberta Ferretti.

‘This look is absolutely huge,’ says Alex. ‘It’s already filtered down to the High Street — Accessorize have got an amazing cross-body fringed bag for £65. Don’t wear it with other fringing — keep everything else pared back.’ Zara has a good selection of fringed bags, too, ranging from a £17.99 hippy style, in tan with pink mini-pom poms, to a £99.99 black leather version with chic chain trim.

SADDLE UP

Mulberry’s £495 Tessie

Alongside the fringed bag is that other Seventies staple, the saddle bag, as revived this season by its originator Gucci, who sent it down the catwalk over fitted suede outfits, with sturdy webbing straps and the double-G logo canvas.

This is less boho than bourgeois, and the difficulty is making it look like it’s not just one you’ve kept from the first time round.

Luckily, while the Gucci version is pointedly a shoulder bag, most of the High Street options build on the cross-body style that’s been growing for a while.

Classic Seventies brand Tula has a stylish version in tan leather for £125; Mulberry’s £495 Tessie, which looks like a vintage satchel, has been going great guns since its launch; and Vida Vida has a vintage-inspired one for £65 at Not On The High Street.

BUCKETS OF STYLE

Zara’s mock-croc version, £99.99

In a move away from flat totes to more compact shapes, following the dominance of the Michael Kors Jetset last year, the bucket bag — which has a rounder base, giving it that bucket shape, and often pulls in at the top with a cord — has become increasingly popular.

Victoria Beckham’s structured version for SS15 combines a rigid cylinder with a soft gathered top and costs £1,050 for the leopard print version, while LK Bennett has its Jenna bag in pink or blue for £450. Get one with a zip pocket inside to avoid too much rummaging around. Zara’s mock-croc version, £99.99, mimics the gloss of the Beckham version.

FLOWER POWER

Tincon shopper, £39

Inevitably for spring, florals are a big trend, and this year they are big, bold and even cartoonish — everyone from Victoria Beckham to Viktor & Rolf splashed stylised flowers across their clothes and bags. Don’t, says Longmore, team them with other florals. ‘Unless you have a really bold look and personality, you could end up with quite a startling clash.’

Ted Baker is no stranger to a flowery print, and this Tincon shopper, £39, would look great dressing up basic jeans.

Nica’s ‘Maggie’ print captures the stylised florals that were all over the catwalk, for £45.

NOVEL INSPIRATION

Anya Hindmarch’s back-to-school pencil case clutch, £895

Colour comes into the picture with Burberry’s bright, book cover-inspired clutches on the catwalk, and there is a distinctly bookish approach to Versace’s totes, plastered in pen compartments, and Anya Hindmarch’s back-to-school pencil case clutch, £895, too.

A rather more affordable version comes from Not On The High Street, where book-inspired clutches cost £42, or for something really special, Olympia Le-Tan has hand-embroidered box clutches with Disney book covers from around £1,000.

These are distinctly tongue-in-cheek, of course, but they look great with bluestocking fashion — simple, slightly gawky dresses, preppy cropped trousers and crisp fitted T-shirts.

SPOTS AND DOTS

LK Bennett’s giant-dot Kenzie tote, £225

If bright hues are not your bag, fear not: monochrome is more fashionable than ever, with stripes and spots all over the catwalks.

Armani was a strong advocate for bold monochrome contrasts, but on the High Street it’s one of the easiest-to-find looks, from LK Bennett’s giant-dot Kenzie tote, £225 , to Marks & Spencer’s strong striped tote, £39.50, which wouldn’t look out of place in My Fair Lady’s Ascot scene.

Avoid pairing with patterns, because the strength of black-and-white will always overwhelm another print.
