Jack Butland has welcomed the prospect of England’s Euro 2015 challenge receiving help from above but warned there will be no preferential treatment for star names.

With the Under-21s having stylish secured a trip to the Czech Republic next summer, England have already started preparing for the tournaments by lining up two demanding friendlies in November, at home against Portugal and a trip to France.

A debate is raging, though, as to which players Gareth Southgate should select. If, for instance, England included all those who were eligible, from players such as Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling, they would have to be considered favourites.

Loading the squad with high-profile individuals is not something Southgate will do. England will certainly travel with a strong squad but the identity of who goes will be decided by Southgate, Roy Hodgson and Dan Ashworth, the Football Association’s Technical Director.

Southgate and Ashworth put individual cases forward to Hodgson for those in the seniors who are eligible to play for the Under-21s and that, for example, is what happened this month with Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw.

Hodgson agreed that it would be better for Shaw to play two games against Croatia, rather than spending time on the bench against San Marino and Estonia, and he would also have released Calum Chambers, had Everton defender John Stones not damaged his ankle ligaments.

Shaw slotted back into Southgate’s group effortlessly and took nothing for granted and Butland, the Under-21s’ captain, says that is an example others would have to follow if it is decided England’s novices would benefit from taking some who have been with the seniors.

At this early stage, it would be no surprise if Everton midfielder Ross Barkley ended up heading to the Czech Republic, but, for once England are not short of options.

‘That is why it is good being a player not a manager picking this squad,’ said Butland. ‘We have a fantastic amount of talent in this 22 of players. We have had players who have gone up and come down. Luke has come down and it is like he never left.

‘We are confident whoever it is, we will get on really well. We will welcome anyone in. First of all we have to continue play the way we do. If people come down for the seniors it doesn't mean they run things. Everyone works for their position. That is the mentality we have had.

‘Everyone fights for their place so they deserve it. We have to keep that next summer. We have got to carry that forward now to the bigger stage in the summer. Losing and going out was not an option because we have too much talent. Now we need some really tough friendlies.

‘Playing against teams who will push us to the limit. We might lose. But we have got to learn to play against the top teams. We might beat them. That is the only way we will be prepared for the finals next summer. Then we will assess where we are at.’

Maintaining the balance and harmony of a group that has won 10 consecutive games and is undefeated in 13 matches will be essential if England are to stand any chance of winning the tournament, something of which Southgate is well aware.

He has explained at great length recently what he will be looking at when it comes to picking his final 23, as while some big names could feasibly be picked – like Sterling and Wilshere – Southgate has questioned what they would gain from dropping down to the Under-21s.

It will not, however, stop the discussion. Stuart Pearce, Southgate’s predecessor, has consistently spoken out that England will never progress as a football nation until they get into the habit of naming their strongest possible squad for these tournaments.

‘I love him because he fights my battles for me!’ Southgate said with a telling smile. ‘But I set out from the start saying I am not going to worry about who I can’t have. Some of those things will be taken out of our hands with injuries and things like that.

‘I still think if a young player is first choice in the senior team – like Raheem – then it is hard for a development coach to deny them that opportunity. There is a different debate if they are not in the team. Myself and Roy have talked about that a lot and that will be ongoing.’
