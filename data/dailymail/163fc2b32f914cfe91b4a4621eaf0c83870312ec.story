A playboy drug baron who stashed an arsenal of guns and ammunition in a young mother's Honda Civic in exchange for letting her friend drive his Maserati has been jailed for 27 years.

Babs Arogundade, 28, who also owned a Bentley, lived a life of luxury and regularly splashed out thousands of pounds on champagne and expensive jewellery including diamond-encrusted Rolex watches.

However, his gangster lifestyle came to light when he was caught stashing lethal weapons in the boot of 27-year-old mother Bianca Willoughby's car in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.

Police found four shotguns, a loaded Smith and Wesson handgun and a Winchester rifle when they raided the vehicle during a surveillance operation focusing on Arogundade's criminal lifestyle.

His crimes were outlined at the Old Bailey on Friday, where he was convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs and possession of firearms.

The court heard how Arogundade often frequented expensive West End nightclubs and met Ms Willoughby two nights before he was caught in May 2013.

She is said to have agreed to help him with 'a favour' after she went to his home in St John's Wood, north west London, to ask for financial support for her business.

The 'favour' was to look after bags filled with the weapons in exchange for him allowing her friend to borrow his expensive Maserati for a wedding.

Prosecutor Tom Wilkins told the court about the operation on May 27, 2013, which led to the conviction of the 'charismatic gangster'.

He told the Old Bailey: 'Armed officers intercepted a blue Honda Civic parked in Hemel Hempstead and found Willoughby sitting in the driver's seat with her four-year-old son sitting next to her.

'Inside the boot was four shotguns, a hand gun and a rifle together with compatible ammunition.'

Arogundade was standing by the boot with a sports bag, the prosecutor said.

He added: 'The prosecution say he brought that bag and would have used it to take back whichever firearms he was going to select from Willoughby's car.'

The cache included a Smith and Wesson revolver containing one bullet, a Winchester rifle with seven rounds, a sawn off pump-action shotgun and three other shotguns with more than 300 shells.

Mr Wilkins said the stash could 'really only be described as an arsenal of guns and ammunition'.

A shotgun was among the items seized from Ms Willoughby's car. The Old Bailey heard that he kept the weaponry in her Honda Civic in return for allowing her friend to borrow his expensive Maserati for a wedding

Ammunition was also discovered hidden in bags in the boot of the car, which was occupied by Ms Willoughby and her four-year-old son in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, when police raided it in 2013

Both Willoughby and Arogundade were arrested at the scene and the young mother told police she had agreed to do the favour following a visit to his home.

She claimed he let her stay the night when she asked for financial help, but spent most of the time fending off unwelcome sexual advances.

She told the court: 'He said: "Did your friend enjoy the Maserati?", he was saying it would be a lot of money to hire'.

'He said: "I did you a favour, and I would like you to do a favour".'

The court heard a set of keys to the Maserati were later found stashed along with diamond-encrusted jewellery and expensive watches under a sink at an address in Isleworth, west London.

Mr Wilkins said it showed Arogundade was 'storing items at premises under the control of women he knew.'

Despite the keys being found, it is believed the Maserati was sold on to a private owner before Arogundade was convicted.

Ms Willoughby was cleared of 15 offences of possessing guns and ammunition but a jury found Arogundade guilty of the same charges following a trial.

He was also found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine along with 34-year-old co-defendant Fred Jones-Lartey, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Another co-defendant, Nicole Douglas, 28, also admitted the same charge after she was caught with a kilogramme of cocaine in her car on May 7, 2013 and was handed a four-year jail term.

The court heard how the Class A drug was found wrapped in pink children's wrapping paper after police stopped her Blue Vauxhall Astra in south west London.

The package contained 74 per cent pure cocaine, which is said to have a street value of £200,000.

Weighing scales, plastic bags containing 1.22kg of crack cocaine and cutting agent were later found at her address in Wembley.

Police had earlier seen Arogundade place an item into the back of Douglas' car and his fingerprints and those of Jones-Lartey were also found on the bags.

A garage registered to Jones-Lartey was found containing presses to make 1 kilo bars of cocaine as well as an empty 25 kilogramme barrel of a well-known cutting agent.

Arogundade was sentenced to 15 years for the drug offence to be served consecutively with an eight-year sentence for possession of a loaded handgun and four years for possession of a loaded rifle, making 27 years in all.

Judge Anuja Dhir QC handed Arogundade concurrent jail terms of six years on another firearms charge, two years on a further count and three years respectively for three other charges.

She imposed no further sentence on another eight counts.

Jailing Arogundade, the judge said: 'The court heard... about your lifestyle, which involved luxury cars, a Bentley and a Maserati, a collection of expensive watches, which were found, a Rolex and equally expensive brands, and a collection of diamond-encrusted jewellery.

'As to the guns. You stored those guns in the car of someone I am satisfied that you took advantage of the fact she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was more vulnerable than usual.

'I have no doubt you are not just a drug dealer, but somebody with a leading role in an organisation involved in supplying multi-kilos of Class A drugs.

Co-defendants Fred Jones-Lartey, 34, (left) and Nicole Douglas, 28, (right) were also jailed at the Old Bailey on Friday for 12 years and four years respectively after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine

Police found a kilogramme of cocaine in a car belonging to Nicole Douglas on May 7, 2013 and later found she had links to Arogundade. Crack cocaine and cutting agents were later found at her address in Wembley

The court heard how cocaine, with a street value of £200,000, was found wrapped in pink children's wrapping paper after police stopped Nicole Douglas as she drove her Blue Vauxhall Astra across south west London

'You have a charismatic personality and you were able and you did encourage and persuade others to help you in your criminal activities.

'I have no doubt that some of them did so for very little personal gain and without knowing the full extent to which you were including them in serious criminal activities.

'Some of them, formerly of good character, were drawn to you because of your personality, women who regarded you as a friend. You took advantage of that trust.'

Following the sentencing, detective inspector Keely Smith, from the Metropolitan Police Service's Projects Team, said: 'This case has prevented six firearms from reaching the streets of London and having potentially lethal outcomes.

'I believe Arogundade was looking to sell the weapons on to those who would be willing to use them.

'This investigation highlights the work my team is doing on a day-to-day basis to keep the community safe.'
