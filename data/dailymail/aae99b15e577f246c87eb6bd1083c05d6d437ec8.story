Millions of middle-class Britons must get ready to pay higher taxes, Nick Clegg has declared.

With the nation facing its longest period of belt-tightening since the war, the Deputy Prime Minister said the ‘top 10 per cent’ – around 3million earning more than £50,500 – should brace themselves for new levies.

Options include an end to tax relief on pension contributions for higher-rate taxpayers, an ‘accessions tax’ to replace inheritance tax, and further increases in capital gains tax.

Unlikely class warrior: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg unveiled plans to hit millions of high-earning Britons with new taxes at the first full day of the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday

At the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, Mr Clegg today insisted Mr Clegg that the majority of people thought that a £60,000 salary was 'a considerable amount of money'.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The vast majority of people - 90 per cent of the people in the country - would think a salary of £60,000, £70,000, £80,000 is a considerable amount of money.

Nick Clegg today said he had developed a ‘thicker skin’ after two years in government – and he thinks he now know what he wants to do with power.

In a surprising admission, the Liberal Democrat leader appeared to suggest that when the coalition was formed in 2010 he did not know what he hoped to achieve, or how to concentrate on what was important.

‘Strangely enough – I know this is contrary to the characterisation that people want to impose on me – I am much clearer in my own mind now two and a half years into it what want to do for the second half of the parliament,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘Of course I have learned things. My skin has got thicker.

‘I have had to apologise for mistakes I have made, but I have learned I think more than I had at the beginning how to really distinguish the stuff that’s important - whether it is business banks, fairer taxes, more apprenticeships, that will stand the test of time - and the day to day stuff that can dominate daily politics.’

'People - decent, fair-minded folk who are earning far, far more than the national average - understand that they do need to make a fair contribution.'

Mr Clegg has said he is confident that the Conservatives would sign up to new taxes on the top 10 per cent.

In return, he suggested he was open to Tory moves to cut more from the vast benefits bill.

Mr Clegg said the highest earners were already paying more overall, thanks to Budget decisions taken by the Coalition.

He added: ‘As fiscal restraint has to carry on for longer than we thought, you have to ask people at the top to make a [further] contribution.’ 

On the first full day of the conference:

It is the Deputy Prime Minister’s stance on tax, designed in part to appease his party’s restive Left-wing grassroots, that will most alarm Tory MPs.

New taxes on those earning over £50,500 would hit middle-class families in Conservative heartlands in London and the South East.

Among the jobs paying such a salary are primary school deputy head, police inspector, fire brigade watch manager and senior nurse consultant.

The Lib Dems have long campaigned for a ‘mansion tax’ – an annual levy on high-value properties – but are devising alternative proposals having failed to persuade Mr Osborne to go ahead.

In a policy consultation document, the party said the most significant levy on wealth was inheritance tax, paid on a person’s estate over the value of £325,000.

It is avoided by many using trusts, gifts or various reliefs, for example on agricultural land and property.

The document suggested an ‘accessions tax’, where the liability would fall on the person receiving the legacy rather than the estate of the deceased. This would make the tax impossible to avoid.

The Lib Dems also want to target tax breaks offered to high earners on their pension contributions.

Currently, annual retirement contributions of up to £50,000 are exempt from tax. The Chancellor cut that threshold from £255,000 in his first emergency Budget, but the Lib Dems want to go further.

Mr Clegg told BBC TV’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘We now know that the country is going to have to go through a period of belt-tightening for longer than we’d hoped, and whoever is going to be in government in the next parliament – Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats or a combination of all three – will have to introduce further savings.

‘When I hear people from the Right say all the money should come from poor people . . . who have lost their work and need some support before they find new work, that all the money should be taken away from them – I’m saying no, hang on a minute, let’s make sure that we do this as fairly as possible.’

Mr Clegg said there was a ‘very considerable chance’ of the Tories agreeing new wealth taxes, pointing out that the Coalition has already increased capital gains tax and stamp duty, while clamping down on tax avoidance.

‘I think many people who are of considerable wealth in this country want to play their part,’ he said. ‘I don’t think you can ask people on middle and low incomes who, after all, are the vast majority of the British population, to bear the brunt of this adjustment.’

The Lib Dems, who are flatlining in the polls, are desperate to use the conference to demonstrate areas where they differ from their Conservative coalition partners. As well as on the economy, they are highlighting arguments over the environment and civil liberties.
