Italy coach Antonio Conte has played down his exclusion of Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli for upcoming European Championship qualifying matches.

Balotelli has yet to score in the Premier League since joining from AC Milan, but has managed one goal in the Champions League.

The enigmatic forward was left out of the last Italy squad due to suspension and, although available for selection this time, he has again been omitted.

The former AC Milan forward has struggled for form since joining Liverpool in the summer 

Conte said: 'He started on a new path, it's not easy. Let's give him time to integrate himself in this new league.'

Southampton striker Graziano Pelle received his first call up and Conte says he 'represents that which I've said from the very first day - meritocracy.'

Italy hosts Azerbaijan in Palermo on Friday, then makes a short trip to visit Malta three days later. 

Balotelli began Liverpool's last game as a substitute, losing his place in the side to Rickie Lambert
