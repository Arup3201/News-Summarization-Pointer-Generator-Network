A huge fire that engulfed a Falmouth hotel forcing Blur guitarist Graham Coxon to flee has left the building a smouldering shell.

Around 30 guests, including Coxon, were evacuated from the Best Western Falmouth Beach Hotel in Falmouth, Cornwall yesterday after the blaze broke out.

Twelve unaccounted for guests - thought to have gone on day trips - have all been found safe and well, Devon and Cornwall police said.

A spokesman said they did not think there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding the blaze, although the investigation continues.

Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said the alarm was raised just after noon yesterday and more than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze.

At its height, 10 appliances and two aerial platforms fought the fire at the 120-bedroom hotel - one of the biggest in Falmouth.

Firefighters' efforts to control the fire were hampered by strong winds which fanned the flames, allowing the fire to spread throughout the building, causing the roof to collapse.

Alternative accommodation had to be found for 30 people from the Falmouth Beach Hotel, plus 100 guests at the neighbouring St Michael's Hotel.

It took firefighters more than seven hours to bring the fire under control, but crews remained at the hotel last night damping down hot spots.

Guitarist Coxon was due to perform at the town's Princess Pavilion venue last night.

On Twitter he said: 'We have rooms at the beach hotel and had to leave when the smell of smoke.'

He later added: 'We watched it... We had to leave the foyer and then watch it get worse and worse..rather sad.'

The family-run Falmouth Beach Hotel, which opened in 1984, became part of the Best Western group of hotels in 2000.

A Best Western spokesman said hotel accommodation had been found within Falmouth for people who were due to stay at the Falmouth Beach this week.

The hotel's event coordinator had also begun to contact couples who were due to celebrate their weddings, the spokesperson added.

The mayor of Falmouth, Geoffrey Evans, said the fire was a disaster for the town and 'couldn't have happened at a worse time'.

Next month Falmouth is due to host the Finn Cup sailing competition and is one of the towns to welcome the Olympic Torch on the first day of its relay throughout the UK.

A Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'The scene is still being monitored, the crew are monitoring hot spots and damping down.

'A fire investigation will be taking place later this morning.
