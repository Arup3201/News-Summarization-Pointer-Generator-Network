It's not the usual sleek and sophisticated style Crown Princess Mary is renowned for, but the Danish Royal still managed to looking stunning as she donned a traditional costume to visit a Greenlandic town on a summer holiday with her family.

Australian-born Princess Mary and husband Crown Prince Frederick visited Qaqortoq, the capital of Southern Greenland, with their four children over the weekend as part of their seven day summer sailing cruise around the country.Â 

The Royal couple and their children - Prince Christian, 8, Princess Isabella, seven, and three-year-old twins, Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent - charmed the crowd of local residents as they stepped off their yacht in the lively national dress.

Prince Christian sported a white anorak and a pair of black and white kamiks,  while his sister Princess Isabella wore traditional eastern Greenlandic attire featuring a white anorak with red beading.

But it was the adorable young twins who stole the show as Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent wore national costumes from northern Greenland, with the young Prince dressed in pants made from polar bear skin.

Pants made from polar bear skin and boots made from seal skin are typical in North Greenland due to the colder climate. To this day, hunters use every part of an animal they catch - the meat is eaten and the skin is used for everyday clothing and the national dress.

The Royal family, who wore the traditional outfits as a sign of respect for the Inuit culture, made their way through Qaqortoq on Sunday with a throng a locals tailing behind. They planted trees and the four children played about before boarding the royal yacht again.

The family is half way through the sailing holiday around Greenland.
