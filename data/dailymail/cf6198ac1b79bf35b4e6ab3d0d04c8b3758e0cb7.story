Jones,
 20, who in 2010 became the highest paid child actor in television 
history at 17 netting $300,000 per episode, left the show last year at 
the end of the tenth season after he made controversial comments that he
 had embraced Christianity and found the role he was playing didn't jive
 well with his religious values. He made negative remarks about the 
series and said he wanted to exit.

In a video posted
 in November 2012 by The Forerunner Chronicles, Jones discussed why he 
decided to get closer to his Christian background. He also said, 'If you
 watch ‘Two and a Half Men,’ please stop watching [it]…I’m ​on ‘​Two and
 a Half Men’; I don’t want to be on it.  Please stop watching it. Please
 stop filling your head with filth.'

Now
 sporting a scruffy beard and long hair, Jones, who lives in Colorado 
where he attends the University of Colorado in Boulder, has fully 
embraced Christianity, and he visits churches across the country, 
speaking about God and religion.

'It
 was difficult for me to be on the show and be part of something that 
was making light of topics in our world where there are really problems 
for a lot of people,' Jones told Houston,Texas, television station KHOU. “I was a paid hypocrite because I wasn’t OK with it and I was still doing it.

When he left the show, Jones walked away from a popular role that made him a rich teenger. At the time, he was making $350,000 per episode, or $8.4 million a season. His net worth is estimated at $15 million, according to CelebrityNetworth.com.

Jones was in Houston over the weekend where he spoke at World Harvest Outreach, a Seventh-Day Adventist congregation. He read from the Bible and also told parishioners why he embraced Christianity.

“I really want to come into the light because I know that is where the healing is and I’ve seen God do amazing things,” said Jones.

“He really considers his relationship 
with God and what he’s putting out in the atmosphere to be a lot more 
important than his reputation in Hollywood,' World Harvest Outreach 
Church Pastor James R. Doggett Sr., told KHOU. 'Angus, I’m not sure 
really cares a whole lot about being an actor or being well known in 
that regard.'

Although Jones has left acting for now, he says he may not be gone for long.

“There’s a few different productions that like do kind of Bible-based stories. Stuff like that,” Jones said.
