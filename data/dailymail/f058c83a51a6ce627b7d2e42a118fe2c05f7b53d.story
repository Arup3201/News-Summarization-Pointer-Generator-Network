It seems that no showbiz party is complete without an appearance from former WAG turned TV presenter Lizzie Cundy. 

Yet the ex-wife of former Chelsea defender Jason may be forced to end her champagne lifestyle – because she has been diagnosed with the pre-cancerous throat condition Barrett’s oesophagus.

The cause of the disease is thought to be long-term acid reflux, or heartburn – and alcohol consumption is thought to exacerbate the problem.

Lizzie first sought medical advice after she ‘woke up in agony in the night with terrible chest pains, after months of not feeling well’, she recalls. 

The condition, in which the cells lining the oesophagus become abnormal due to constant reflux, is thought to affect about two in every 100 Britons.

The divorced 46-year-old mother of two, who is currently filming her new Sky TV show London Style, continues: ‘It’s very scary because I understand it can develop into throat cancer.’

Lizzie says she is on a cocktail of drugs to control the problem.

Aspirin could be an effective treatment for schizophrenia – helping the thousands of sufferers who do not respond to the usual first-line treatment of anti-psychotic medication.

The condition affects about one person in 100, causing severe delusions and hallucinations. Anti-psychotics – which correct levels of the brain chemical dopamine, thought to be involved in driving the condition – don’t work for everyone, with up to 30 per cent of patients not responding at all.

Now researchers at the Department of Psychiatry at Utrecht University’s medical centre have found that combining anti-psychotics with the common painkiller improves recovery.

Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug as well as a painkiller and blood-thinner. Although the exact reason that it boosts the effectiveness of anti-psychotics is unknown, one theory is that it has an effect on the immune system, which may be a factor in the disease.

'Hospitals need sound of music' 

The sister of philosopher Alain de Botton is urging the NHS to provide ‘healing music’ to patients.

Singer Miel de Botton, a former clinical psychologist who recently performed a special concert at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, said: ‘The hospital has a fantastic healing arts programme.’

Daisy Fancourt, the hospitals arts and enterprising health manager, agreed, saying: ‘Research projects we are running are providing evidence of the profound psychological and physiological benefits that music can bring.’

Dogs aid a good night's sleep

Sharing a bed with your dog may improve your sleep. More than seven out of ten people share a bed or room with their dogs, and many say it helps them to nod off, and sleep more soundly.

A study at the Medical University of Vienna carried out an internet-based survey where they quizzed pet owners about their sleeping arrangements.

The online survey included 22 questions about various aspects related to sleep habits and sleep quality, and pets.

About 90 per cent of the 630 people who took part were women, with an average age of 38, and 43 per cent owned more than one dog. Seventy-eight per cent said they regularly slept with the dogs in the same bed or room. ‘The overwhelming majority believed their sleep quality to be positively influenced by the dog,’ say the researchers.

‘They also rated their sleep as sounder and deeper and fell asleep more easily.’

Some research has shown that the companionship of owning a dog in the UK can lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and improve mood.

However, the research suggests that getting too close to man’s best friend can also have ill effects.

The study concluded that bed-sharing with domestic pets could lead to the spread of infections. ‘Although uncommon with healthy pets, the risk for transmission through bed-sharing, kissing and licking, is real,’ the report says. 

In need of a pick-me-up to improve your performance at the gym? A new beetroot-based sports bar could be the answer. Each 60g Beet It Sport bar contains 400mg of dietary nitrate (the equivalent of 400ml of beetroot juice).

This is believed to boost nitric-oxide levels in the blood, which increases blood flow and oxygen supply to the muscles.

Despite its intense pinky-purple colour, the bar tastes like an oaty flapjack.
